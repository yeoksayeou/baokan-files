### Lushan Summer Camp Commemorative Week: Chairman's Instructions on the Essentials of National Reconstruction, Seize the Opportunity to Implement Disciplined Living

[Our Newspaper, Guling, 12th] Chairman Chiang held a tea party at his official residence at 5:30 PM on the 12th, summoning Central Committee members He Zhonghan, Liu Keshu, Li Jingzhai, Gu Zhenggang, Lai Lian, Deng Wenyi, Yuan Shouqian, Deputy Secretary-General of the Central Propaganda Department Lu Qixin, and Deputy Director of the Summer Camp Liu Jianqun. From the 13th to the 15th, the Chairman will personally attend the Summer Camp from 4:20 PM to 5:20 PM each afternoon to conduct roll call of the students, one or three brigades each day.

[Our Newspaper, Guling, 12th] Chairman Chiang personally attended the Summer Camp at 9:00 AM on the 12th to preside over the Commemorative Week address. Other attendees included Chief of General Staff Chen Cheng, Education Director Jiang Jingguo, and over 900 officers and students of the camp. After the formalities, the Chairman began his address, which can be divided into three points: (1) Seize the Opportunity: Although the eight years of arduous resistance against Japan have passed, the future national reconstruction will be even more difficult than the eight years of resistance. It has been a year since the victory, and we have endured all kinds of hardships during this year. However, we believe that history cannot be erased, and this opportunity is the most difficult period in the last fifty years, but it is also a rare opportunity. This has never happened before, and it will never happen again. Therefore, we must seize this opportunity to contribute to the country at this time. (2) The overall plan for national reconstruction has been clearly elaborated in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings and does not need to be repeated. What I want to encourage you today is that I hope you will follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings and work in a down-to-earth manner. (3) Life must be disciplined, hardworking, thrifty, and simple. The reason why our country cannot become strong is that the bureaucratic habits are too strong, corrupt, and extravagant. You must know that thrift is more important than production, and extravagance and corruption are the factors that destroy a country. I am willing to be a role model for you in terms of lifestyle, and I hope everyone can do it. Without a disciplined life, one cannot establish a family and career, and cannot even be a human being.

### US Envoys Continue to Mediate, Frequent Contact with Both Sides, Zhou Enlai's Words are Contradictory

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] Ambassador Stuart visited Marshal Ma at 9:00 AM this morning to convey Zhou Enlai's attitude expressed during last night's talks. He returned to the embassy at 10:30 AM and met with Yu Dawei for about an hour. After Ambassador Stuart left Marshal Ma's residence, Zhou Enlai visited Marshal Ma at 11:00 AM and did not leave until about 1:00 PM. In the afternoon, Marshal Ma visited Ambassador Stuart again at the embassy and did not leave until 6:45 PM. At 7:00 PM, Yu Dawei visited Ambassador Stuart again and did not leave until 8:30 PM. Political negotiations seem to be showing frequent contact under the efforts of both Stuart and Marshall.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] It is reported that the meeting between Ambassador Stuart and Zhou Enlai was to discuss the Anping Incident. The meeting between Zhou Enlai and Marshal Ma was for Zhou to express the Communist Party's attitude towards the negotiations after the Communist Party issued a statement on the joint statement by Stuart and Marshall.

[United Press, Nanjing, 12th] Ambassador Stuart had lunch with Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi this afternoon. According to the Ambassador, they discussed "other matters" during the lunch, but it is generally believed that they discussed the spreading civil war.

According to sources from the Communist Party delegation, the Communist Party refuses to consider withdrawing from the five areas of northern Jiangsu and Jehol and firmly stated that it will not accept it.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 12th] All Tokyo newspapers published the statement by Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart on the morning of the 12th in a prominent position, attaching great importance to it and expressing disappointment.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] During Zhou Enlai's meeting with Stuart last night, Zhou expressed deep gratitude for their efforts and hoped that they would continue to work for peace in China. The Ambassador said that he was sincerely willing to work on mediation but hoped that the two sides' opinions would be closer. He also asked whether the Communist Party could make some concessions. Zhou said that he could consider it. At this point, Ambassador Stuart believed that the door to peace had not been closed. Therefore, after visiting Marshal Ma, Stuart decided to postpone his trip to Peiping to wait for an opportunity to negotiate. However, tonight, the spokesperson of the Communist Party office denied the four words "can consider" and firmly stated that there was no intention to consider.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] Ambassador Stuart interviewed a reporter from the Central News Agency alone on the morning of the 12th, elaborating on his attitude towards peaceful negotiations. The Ambassador said: "We are now looking forward to the progress of the negotiations. I will not give up hope until we believe that there is nothing we can do."

[United Press, Nanjing, 12th] Shao Lizi, Secretary-General of the National Political Council, told the United Press here today that he hoped that Special Envoy Marshall would continue to mediate and promote peace in China. Once the dispute between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is resolved, the US military should withdraw from China because at that time, the mission of the US military in China will have been completed. He believes that US aid to the National Government does not prolong the civil war, but China must resolve its internal disputes, otherwise, "economic destruction is possible."

### Zhou Enlai Said:

Requesting the Security Council to Mediate

[United Press, Nanjing, 12th] This evening's newspapers here reported that Zhou Enlai said that unless American mediators can solve China's internal problems, the CCP will ask the Security Council of the United Nations to mediate. This statement has not been confirmed, and the CCP spokesperson refused to comment on it.

### Wu Zhihui Fell Off the Bed, Decided to Abandon the Trip to Guling

Li Shi Invited to Arrive in Guling

[Central News Agency, Guling, 12th] Central Committee members Li Shizeng, Duan Xipeng, and Ye Xiuxue arrived in Guling at 2:30 PM on the 12th. According to Li, he and Mr. Wu Zhihui were invited by Chairman Chiang to Guling to spend the summer, but because they were waiting for Mr. Wu to recover from his illness, they were delayed in starting their journey. The night before, Mr. Wu suddenly fell from the bed to the ground and decided to abandon the trip to Guling, so he could only come to the mountain alone in response to the invitation. He also said that he had been burying himself in compiling the World Encyclopedia recently and rarely asked about foreign affairs.

### Minister Chen Arrives in Guling for Talks, Still Optimistic About the Future of Negotiations, But the Threat Factors Must Be Removed First

[Central News Agency, Guling, 12th] "The future of peaceful negotiations is still optimistic." This was the reply made by Chen Lifu, Minister of the Central Organization Department, when he arrived in Guling on the 12th when asked by reporters about "the reaction to the joint statement by Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart." The reporter asked why he saw it that way. Chen replied that the government's goal is to resolve domestic disputes through political means. According to the resolution of the CCP Central Political Bureau on the 19th, the CCP seems to regard it as a means. As long as the goal has not changed, then the means can still be used for a while. Therefore, negotiations are still optimistic, but it is hoped that the CCP will change the means to the goal, then the two sides will work towards the same goal, and naturally, they will get closer day by day. Asked: Why can't peaceful negotiations reach an agreement? Answer: There are two factors that threaten peace: (1) Transportation is not restored, (2) The army is not reorganized. To seek peace, the threatening factors must be removed first. If a more scientific method can be adopted to write in black and white the date on which a certain section of transportation will be repaired and open to traffic, the date on which the army at a certain place will be concentrated and reorganized at a certain place, and the two sides will implement it in accordance with the regulations, then a third party can judge right and wrong. Otherwise, empty talk will be useless, and the evaluators will have no basis for judgment. Talking about peace every day without working hard to eliminate the factors that threaten peace is just a waste of time, but delaying time may be what the Communist Party is seeking. Asked: After the Communist army withdraws from northern Jiangsu, what are the Minister's views on the nature of local administration? The Minister smiled and told the reporter that northern Jiangsu is about to be submerged due to the Communist Party's breaching of the dikes, and the people cannot survive. The nature of local administration is probably no longer a problem. The reporter finally asked if Zhou Enlai had replied. The Minister replied no, and said that the Communist Party has mobilized domestic and foreign newspapers and publications to attack me for a full three years, and I have never counterattacked once. Because Zhou Enlai recently publicly slandered me too much to Chinese and foreign journalists, I had to counterattack. I still hope that the Communist Party will change its attitude as soon as possible, be sincere and trustworthy, and not regard the world as very foolish and can be played with. You must know that God will not bless a person who is always lying.

### The Course of Negotiations is Like Climbing Guling

Luo Jialun's Speech

[Central News Agency, Guling, 12th] After the Marshall-Stuart joint statement was issued, reporters visited Luo Jialun, former president of National Central University, Cheng Tianfang, former president of Sichuan University, and Lai Lian, former president of Northwestern University, who were in Guling, to solicit their opinions. They all believed that from the joint statement, we admired the futility of the two gentlemen's efforts for peace in China. The joint statement reported on the current status of peaceful negotiations and the crux of the difficulties. With the enthusiasm and patience of the two gentlemen, they will surely continue to fulfill their mission. Mr. Luo also said: "As I am in Guling, I can give an example to illustrate that the course of peaceful negotiations is like climbing Guling. It seems easy to walk only a hundred steps, but in the middle, it becomes more and more difficult. When you are about to reach the top of the mountain, you are exhausted and powerless, but the clear weather and blue sky are welcoming us there."

### Soviet-Mongolian Communist Military Agreement Has Been Concluded in Zhangjiakou

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 12th] According to information obtained by well-informed sources, a military agreement has been concluded between Zhangjiakou and the Soviet Union and Mongolia. The Soviet-Mongolian army will provide military assistance to the Communist army in the area and station troops in certain areas of Inner Mongolia. According to the information, in early May (around May 8th or 9th), a Soviet-Mongolian military delegation of five people, led by General Su Yuhamaf, including Mongolian Foreign Minister Hamasuo Nuo, Assistant Diplomat Nana Bao, and Translator Er Caiqin Lumu, arrived in Zhangjiakou and held a military agreement meeting. The Communist Party was represented by Nie Rongzhen and Song Shaowen, and Inner Mongolia was represented by Yun Ze, Kui Ju, Suo Dengnamu, Yunlong Sabu, and Pi Leinuoerbu. They discussed military mutual assistance between Inner and Outer Mongolia and the division of garrison areas. The agreement is as follows: (1) Outside the Great Wall area, the Soviet-Mongolian army will station three divisions of more than 45,000 soldiers in Doron Nuur Banner, Pingdingpu, East and West Ujimqin Princes' Palaces, East Ashan Hajir Banner Princes' Palace, Xiade (i.e., Jiabu Temple), Shijiang, Dayu, and the Princes' Palace of the Sizi Tribal Banner, and all passages bordering Inner and Outer Mongolia. (2) The Mongolian and Han civilians of Chahar and Xilin Gol leagues will be trained by the Soviet Union and Mongolia at the same time. (3) New military training will be provided by the Soviet Union and Mongolia with modern new equipment. (4) When military actions are necessary, the defense of the jurisdictional boundaries of Chahar and Xilin Gol leagues will be increased. (5) The Soviet Union and Mongolia will supply weapons to the Communist army in the Chahar and Suiyuan Mongolian jurisdictions, preside over training, and designate garrison areas. (6) The princes of the Mongolian banners must accept three to five Soviet-Mongolian military and political advisors and liaison officers. Nie Rongzhen and Song Shaowen have signed the agreement, but Yun Ze and Kui Xu believed that the conditions did not comply with the conditions for Inner Mongolian independence and did not sign it at that time. They promised to convene a meeting of the princes of the leagues and banners of Inner Mongolia to negotiate and vote before signing it again. After the Soviet-Mongolian representatives left Zhangjiakou on May 10, Yun Ze and others, under the instigation of Nie Rongzhen, did not convene a meeting of the princes of Inner Mongolia and were criticized by Nie and Zhu for believing that Yun Ze's motion on the envoy's seat was intended to undermine the friendly relations between the Communists and the Soviets. Later, on the 16th, Xu was sent as a special envoy to visit Outer Mongolian Chairman Juan Balasan and Soviet Ambassador to Outer Mongolia Ivanorf to discuss the Soviet Communist military mutual assistance and the division of garrison areas. He returned to Zhangjiakou on the 23rd. On the 29th, the Soviet-Mongolian delegation also added Outer Mongolian Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs Tuoleke and held a meeting after arriving in Zhangjiakou. The attendees included representatives from the eight banners of Chahar League, the five parts of Xilin Gol League, and the six banners of Ulanqab League, including Yun Ze, Kui Ju, Keli Gengsongjin, Wangchuk Ulan, Tian Xiean, Chai Jiayatu, Batan Suotenason, Zhama Danba Chong, Xin Qianhu, Suodengnason, Yunlong Sasu, Pi Qin Nuoerbu, Wu Luojina Sheng, and Ling Dongwen. The resolutions are as follows: (1) Same as the first resolution, but the Soviet-Mongolian border will not be defended temporarily. (2) Divide the Soviet army's garrison areas and military assistance and other contents. (A) The Soviet army's garrison areas are from Doron Nuur, north of Shangdu River, Pingdingpu, Youmage Temple, Jiabu Temple, Tumulutai Sizi Tribe, Xilamulun River, etc., and also military defenses in the residences of the northern Mongolian people. (B) Provide military assistance to Chahar when necessary. (C) Defense of the Saling River. The meeting lasted for three days, and the delegation flew back to Kulun on June 4th.

### Investigation of the Anping Incident, US Military Written Report

The Group Decided to Study Outside the Meeting

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 12th] The 25-member group investigating the Anping Incident held a meeting as usual on the 12th and adjourned without results as usual. Although the US member Robertson had drafted the investigation procedures and obtained the consent of the government member Zheng Jiemin, the Communist member Ye Jianying needed to supplement some points and requested instructions from Zhou Enlai. Therefore, the three members have not yet given specific instructions to the 25-member group. At the meeting today, Davis still hoped to hear the Marine Corps report, and Zhang Shuheng, the representative of the Beiping Municipal Government, also believed that hearing the Marine Corps report was an indispensable part of any future investigation procedure. To save time, it is best to hear it as soon as possible. Huang Yifeng, the representative of the Communist Party, was afraid that the group would not be willing to go to the "Liberated Area" to hear the Communist Party's report, forming a default judgment situation. Therefore, before the procedures were decided, he still did not urge to hear the Marine Corps report. As a result, it was decided to study the Marine Corps written report separately outside the meeting.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] It has just been learned that the real situation of the Communist army breaching the dikes in Henan is as follows: (1) In Hebei Province, on July 25, the south bank of the Daqing River near Majiaqiao, 10 kilometers north of Yangcun Town (26 kilometers northwest of Xiongxian), was dug open. On the 27th, the east dike near Baigou (14 kilometers north of Xiongxian) and Gaoqiao (11 kilometers east of Xiongxian) was also dug open, and the city of Xiongxian was flooded. On July 21, the Hebei River dike near Zaofen, 15 kilometers northeast of Cangxian, was dug open, and Cangxian was severely flooded. (2) In Henan Province, at the end of July, the Communist army took advantage of the rising water of the Zhang River to dig open the river dike, causing the flood to flood, and the houses were destroyed.

### Central Memorial Week

Xue Dubi Reports on the Yellow River Project

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] The Central Memorial Week was held at the National Government Auditorium on the morning of the 12th. Bai Chongxi presided over the meeting, and Xue Dubi reported on the reorganization of water conservancy agencies and the progress of water conservancy projects, especially the most detailed explanation of the Yellow River restoration and dike closure, which is of greatest concern to the whole country. He briefly stated: Although the Yellow River restoration and dike closure project is scheduled to be completed in one year after the start of the project, it has received the enthusiastic assistance of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) and local authorities, but due to the repeated obstruction of the Communist Party, the surveying work could not proceed smoothly at first, and then the start date of the project was delayed until March of this year, and it encountered major obstacles in the progress, and once almost all the planned parts were suspended. Although it has been restarted with the firm advocacy of Premier Song and the encouragement and assistance of UNRRA, the flood season has arrived, and the most optimistic estimate is that it will have to wait until the end of this year. This chief administrator of the national water conservancy cause seemed to be full of anger when he repeatedly listed various examples of the Communist Party's deliberate destruction of the Yellow River renovation project.

### Communist Troops in Northern Jiangsu Implement Tyrannical Rule; Land Distribution Involves Torture; Those Receiving Land Tremble in Fear

[Central News Agency, This City Report] According to visitors from Xinghua, Northern Jiangsu, Communist troops in Xinghua are actively distributing land, allocating three mu per person. However, in order to actually receive the land, one must obtain an official deed from the "Democratic Government." The stamp tax for obtaining the deed is equivalent to the price of the land. However, ordinary farmers have no choice but to fulfill the so-called "legal procedures," exhausting their remaining savings to provide for the "Democratic Government's" regular tax needs. In order to obtain the property rights of the land, the "Democratic Government" forces existing landowners to hand over all their land contracts, which are then burned in public to strengthen the belief of those who receive land based on population. If the landowners refuse, Communist cadres will take them to the location of the land and publicly interrogate them, forcing them to hand over the contracts. The landowners are then sent to be exposed to the scorching sun, or wrapped in thick cotton quilts to make them feel as if they are in a fire. Such torture is unprecedented in Chinese penal history. All farmers and landowners, whether they receive or give up land, are terrified. Approximately 80-90% of the fields in Xinghua have been distributed, and the amount of revenue collected by the Communist troops is staggering. According to statistics, Xinghua County has 20,000 mu of fields, each mu worth about eight to ten shi of rice.

Furthermore, it is reported that the Communist-controlled areas in Northern Jiangsu are witnessing a very intense struggle. The so-called "Three Capitalist Classes" have fled completely. Recently, internal struggles have also been triggered within the proletariat. The goal is that when those being struggled against are desperate, they only need to join the Communist troops, and any major offenses they have committed can be forgiven. However, laborers who fear struggle do not want to join the Communist troops. In this extremely tense environment, they can only flee, not daring to stay put. As a result, the saying "Money for money, life for life" has become an unsung "ode." The "Anti-Japanese Currency" issued by the Communist troops used to be exchanged at 35 yuan for one yuan of legal currency between spring and summer, but recently it only exchanges for eight to ten yuan. The depreciation of the currency is a sign of collapse.

### Prosperity of the Northeast's Future Depends on Agricultural Development; Zhang Jia'ao Delivers Speech to Agricultural Group

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 11th] Zhang Jia'ao, Chairman of the Economic Committee of the Executive Headquarters, delivered a speech at a banquet welcoming the Sino-American Agricultural Technical Cooperation Group on the 10th. He said: The Northeast is currently at a crucial juncture as it transitions from the puppet Manchukuo regime back to the motherland. In the past, Japan focused on the industrialization of Manchuria and even developed heavy industry, but Manchuria has always been an agricultural region. In total, there are about 7.57 million households in Manchuria, of which 5.44 million are farmers, accounting for about 72% of the total. The population is 45.89 million, of which about 33.42 million are farmers, a similar percentage. This shows that the prosperity of the Northeast people's future is extremely dependent on agricultural development. In the past, the total national income of Manchuria was 6.8 billion yuan, of which 2.8 billion yuan came from agriculture and about 1.4 billion yuan from industry and mining. This further proves the importance of the agricultural sector in the entire economic structure of Manchuria. Currently, about 200 million mu of arable land has already been cultivated in the Northeast, and there are still more than 20 million mu waiting to be cultivated. The annual output of the cultivated land is about 20 million tons. If calculated based on output and cultivated area, the output is only half that of the United States and Germany. The reasons for the low production are: (1) Insufficient fertilizer, (2) Insufficient irrigation, (3) Poor quality of seeds, (4) Shortage of agricultural machinery. If the above shortcomings can be resolved, and modern scientific methods are adopted to improve the system and eliminate pests, the future production will not be difficult to increase by 20%. Adding the uncultivated arable land, the output can reach 44 million tons per year. Currently, out of the 20 million tons of annual output, 16 million tons are consumed by farmers themselves, used as livestock feed, and stored as seeds for the coming year. The remaining 4 million tons can be exported, half of which is soybeans. Assuming that the entire output can be increased to 44 million tons, exports can be increased by 24 million tons.

### Chairman Expresses Confidence in Sino-American Economic Cooperation

Recent Reply to U.S. President's Letter

[U.S. News Agency, Washington, 11th] Chairman Chiang recently replied to President Truman, expressing confidence that the Sino-American Agricultural Technical Cooperation Group will be the precursor to the implementation of the Sino-American economic and trade cooperation plan. According to President Truman's letter introducing the group, which was personally delivered to Chairman Chiang by General Marshall, it stated: "Agriculture will be included in any Sino-American cooperation plan, and economic cooperation is one of them." In his reply, Chairman Chiang sincerely expressed his agreement with this statement.

### Rushing to Block the Damaged Seawall on the Qiantang River Requires 12 Billion Yuan; Engineering Team is Inspecting the Haining and Haiyan Areas

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 12th] The newly appointed Director of the Qiantang River Seawall Engineering Bureau, Mao Yisheng, made a statement on the seawall project after arriving in Hangzhou. He said: The Qiantang River is one of the three major river engineering projects in China. The collapse of the riverbank has been a constant threat throughout history, and its disaster is even greater than that of the Yellow River. During the Kangxi and Qianlong reigns of the Qing Dynasty, stone seawalls were built, which have lasted for more than 200 years. Due to years of disrepair, dangerous signs have emerged. The current priority is to rush to block the damaged stone seawalls, which are three kilometers long. It costs 4 million yuan to repair one meter, so the project will cost a huge 12 billion yuan for three kilometers. Half of this amount will be used for emergency construction. The central government has already allocated 2 billion yuan, and 700 million yuan has been spent on emergency repairs. The Executive Yuan has allocated 2 billion yuan for work-relief projects, and the local government is raising 2 billion yuan. The remaining half is still not secured. Considering that the Qiantang River is 243 kilometers long, the current work is only patching up leaks. To completely solve the problem, a fundamental plan is needed to regulate the river channel, making the wide and shallow river surface narrow and deep, and fixing both banks so that seawater cannot pass through the river channel, thus maintaining normalcy. This will facilitate irrigation and transform the land on both sides into fertile soil. After building dams, hydropower can be utilized for electrification in the counties along the river, and the fixed river channel with deeper water can be used for navigation.

[Our Newspaper, Haining, 11th] The Qiantang River Seawall Engineering Inspection Team came to Haining for inspection on the 11th. Our special correspondent also accompanied them. The team members worked all day and have gained an understanding of the Qiantang River's water characteristics. However, Haining County is still very desolate, no different from when our reporter came here three months ago. The provincial government has ordered the county government to move back from Xiashi, and perhaps it will be revitalized by then. The Qiantang River seawall may also depend on the inspection. Team leader Hou Jiayuan and team members Di Haimo and Xue Zhuobin returned to Hangzhou early that day due to urgent matters in Shanghai.

They said: This is the emergency repair period, which is to solve the immediate crisis. This autumn tide may pose a danger to the stone seawalls. We have prepared manpower to repair them as soon as they collapse, so there should be no problem. The establishment of the Engineering Bureau is to plan for permanent seawall construction. We are currently planning a clever method to stabilize the riverbed. After we return to Shanghai, we will conduct on-site experiments and seek a reasonable construction plan. Construction must begin this winter. As for the Zhapu port, using hydropower for power generation is a larger plan.

Editorial

### Welcoming "August 13th" with a New Mood - And Congratulating the Establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Council

"August 13th," a day that evokes mixed feelings, has arrived again. In the hearts of every Chinese person, they will never forget this day. This is an extremely important day that determines the life of every Chinese person and the life of the entire Chinese nation. The full-scale outbreak of the Chinese Anti-Japanese War, the rise and fall of the Chinese and Japanese nations, and the subsequent shift of the center of gravity in Far Eastern and world politics in the next 30 to 50 years were all determined on this day nine years ago. Today, this day has returned. Japan, and the entire world, are being liberated from the suffering of war and are moving towards a new life. We remember the bitter struggle of the past nine years and first pay our highest respects to Chairman Chiang, who led us in this national struggle. It was due to the wise leadership of our leader that we were able to overcome all difficulties and achieve victory. We also express our condolences and respect to the countless soldiers and civilians who died in the Anti-Japanese War. It is because of their deaths that we have our lives.

War is an ominous event, and traditional Chinese thought does not value martial arts or like war. Our national war of resistance this time was truly a resistance that we had to undertake for the survival of our nation. Now the Anti-Japanese War has been won, but the survival of our nation is still under serious threat. After a long period of bloody battles, the foundation of the country has already been shaken. What we hoped for from the peaceful victory was that the war would end on its own, that the people would have a chance to live and rest, and that the country could be liberated from the suffering of war and move towards rejuvenation and new life. But unfortunately, although our Anti-Japanese War has been stopped for a year, during this year, the Chinese Communist Party, while negotiating with the government, has sent its armed forces to attack everywhere, causing wars to appear in the Northeast, North China, North Jiangsu, and the Central Plains. Our people, who have been through war and chaos, are still suffering the hardships of upheaval and displacement, and have not yet had a chance to live and rest. Who created this situation? Undoubtedly, it is the Chinese Communist Party. The government, for the sake of peace and for the sake of the people, had to be tolerant in order to seek reconciliation. However, the result of tolerance has made the CCP even more intensified. Today, as we commemorate this historic "August 13th," we deeply believe that for the sake of our national survival, our leader will surely be able to lead us through the current difficulties and lead our nation towards national construction and rejuvenation, just as he led our war of resistance in the past.

Indeed, the current signs make people deeply believe that our leader is leading us towards the great road of national rejuvenation with his steadfast spirit. The obstruction of the Communist Party will eventually be overcome. The people will not allow the Communist Party and its followers to come out and obstruct the great cause of national construction. What the people demand is peace and prosperity. Those who violate this popular will will eventually suffer defeat. This is a lesson of history. The government has expressed its willingness to start anew with the people, actively reorganizing and downsizing the military. Some time ago, it also announced the discharge of a large number of active-duty military officers. This is an unprecedented move in modern Chinese history, and its announcement is on the eve of the ninth anniversary of "August 13th," the first anniversary of Japan's surrender, and its significance is even more profound. This is nothing more than an expression of the government's determination to actively seek governance in order to realize the modernization of our national defense and the nationalization of the military. On the other hand, the return of a large number of military officers to their fields of farming has swept away the bad habits of resisting orders and separatism in the past, which is a gratifying phenomenon of China's political democratization. Regarding the efforts in this aspect of political democratization, although the reorganization of the central government has not yet manifested any factual performance due to the obstruction of the Communist Party and its followers, the establishment of local public opinion organs in local governments is a necessary condition for political democratization. In the past year, since the victory, the establishment of local councils everywhere is a sign of this kind of political democratization. Among these councils, the members of the Shanghai Municipal Council have already been elected and are scheduled to be established on this historic "August 13th." We welcome this "August 13th," which has special significance for the citizens of Shanghai, with a new mood of excitement.

The "August 13th" nine years ago was launched in Shanghai, triggering a full-scale war of resistance. Now, after the victory of the war of resistance, on the first "August 13th" after the victory, we see in Shanghai the formal establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Council. This council is the organ of the people of Shanghai. They represent the citizens of Shanghai in participating in municipal affairs. They come from all walks of life, from all parties, or do not belong to any party, and are produced by citizens voting and electing. It is truly the implementation of democratic politics. Shanghai is the largest city in China. In the past, the occurrence of "August 13th" in Shanghai caused a full-scale war of resistance. Today, on the first "August 13th" after the victory of the war of resistance, what Shanghai reveals to the whole country is the establishment of the Municipal Council, the implementation of democratic politics. The spread of this trend, we deeply believe, can also cause a comprehensive impact, making the national politics tend towards democratization, and achieving the true rejuvenation of the nation. Therefore, in the history of the war of resistance, Shanghai has played a leading role. In the history of national rejuvenation, Shanghai should now also play a demonstration and leading role in the country due to the establishment of the Municipal Council.

Therefore, the responsibility of the Shanghai Municipal Council is quite heavy. As a public opinion organ, on the eve of the implementation of constitutional government, we hope that the Shanghai Municipal Council can exert its greatest power. The core of democratic politics is that the people have the final power. Looking at our theory of "power" and "ability," it is the master. Since Shanghai's restoration, the municipal measures have not been without controversy. Now that the Municipal Council is established, it must actively exert its role in supervising the government and set an example for our country's future democratic politics. The war is over. We welcome "August 13th" with a new mood. What it represents is not war, but China's rejuvenation.

### Former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Analyzes Soviet Realpolitik (Part 1): He Said Roosevelt Was Wrong

Former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, William Bullitt, in his book "The Great Globe Itself," analyzed in detail the ideology, policies, and real diplomatic background of the Soviet Union. For people who want to understand everything about the Soviet Union, this book seems to be extremely worth reading. The book has five chapters, and what is excerpted here is a small part of the book.

The Soviet Union, as President Roosevelt said in a speech on February 10, 1940, is a "completely dictatorial country, more thorough than any dictatorial country in Europe." A year later, Germany attacked the Soviet Union, and the United States, for its own interests, decided to help the Soviet Union. President Roosevelt was willing to help the Soviet Union in the war without limits, but hoped to persuade Stalin to abandon his outward aggression and adopt democratic politics. Critics pointed out that this was impossible, but Roosevelt did not believe it. As a result, the Soviet Union's actions in Poland, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Germany, Iran, Korea, and Northeast China after the war all proved that President Roosevelt was wrong, although he did not see it himself.

Why does Stalin still do this? The Soviet Union has such a vast territory, a sparse population, uncultivated land everywhere, rich mineral deposits, endless resources, and the people are suffering from war and urgently need to recuperate. So, why is the Soviet government's ambition for expansion still so endless?

To understand this problem, we must first understand the fundamental outward aggression of the Soviet Union. Some of them are due to historical psychological factors, and some are due to dogmas in the doctrine.

(1) Traditional Suspicion

The ancestors of the Russians were the residents of the forests in the Ukraine and the Novgorod-Moscow region. It is a plain with no natural barriers in sight, stretching from Mongolia to Podolia. On this vast and fertile Eurasian plain, since the early days of civilization, there have been successive westward migrations of barbaric peoples. The Russians have always been helpless against this group of invading tribes, and the neighboring tribes in the north, south, and west are all eyeing them covetously. They are often conquered. Their history is a tragic story of a series of wars, famines, suffering, massacres, rapes, and enslavement. In this painful lesson, they learned to regard everyone else as ill-intentioned robbers. Sometimes, they also get along well with neighboring countries, but this is only a temporary "truce." Permanent peace like ours has never existed in their history. Therefore, the Russians have to constantly suspect the powerful countries outside. In their view, in order to survive, they have to use deception and war. On the surface, they get along well with people, but secretly prepare to attack. The traditional historical environment has made them develop this kind of second nature.

(2) Seven Hundred Years of Dictatorship

Throughout Russian history, autocratic dictators have ruled. They have never known what it is like to live under a free order. The totalitarian form of Russian politics was established from 1240 when Batu, the grandson of Genghis Khan, conquered Russia. For two hundred years, Russia was subject to the rule of the Mongols. The Russian nobles were absolutely obedient to the rulers. Russian historian Vernadsky said:

[The Mongolian influence can be seen in all aspects of the Russian political and social system. The Mongolian Khanate was based on the idea of ​​absolute obedience of the individual to the ruler and the state. This idea, as a result, deeply penetrated the blood of the Russians. That is, all classes must perform compulsory service to the state. The Mongols also brought in a new concept, namely the absolute power of the ruler. The authority of the Khan is a brutal force, and obedience is absolute. This concept of the absolute power of the ruler still remains after the fall of the Mongol Empire.]

From the era of Mongolian rule until now, the Russians have become accustomed to living under a totalitarian dictatorship, and it is natural for them to feel that the country is led by a dictator and that they cannot intervene. (To be continued)

### Our Investment in the International Bank: Share Payment Remitted to the US Yesterday

Our country's subscription to the authorized capital of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development was originally 600 million US dollars. It was decided at the International Monetary and Financial Conference that those who suffered excessive losses due to enemy devastation or war could first pay 20% of the total amount, totaling 120 million US dollars. Within this 120 million US dollars, another 0.5% could be paid after five years. Therefore, the actual amount paid this time was 120 million US dollars, minus the 0.5% (3 million US dollars) to be paid after five years, totaling 90 million US dollars. Our country had previously paid the bank's administrative expenses of 60,000 US dollars. Therefore, the settlement this time only required the payment of 89.94 million US dollars. According to reliable sources, this amount was remitted to Washington by the Central Bank in full yesterday. Our country's investment ranks fourth, after the US, Britain, and the Soviet Union.

### Report on the Former Changdao Foreign Firm's Automobile Repair Shop: Concealment of Enemy and Puppet Materials; Members of the Investigation Team Personally Visit Xuan Tiewu; Wang Zhuchen Narrates the Process of Repairing Cars on Behalf

[Our Newspaper's Report] Since receiving a confidential report from the Korean Sun Tianchangzhi exposing the case of supplying enemy military materials, the Reception and Investigation Team recently received a report that Wang Zhuchen concealed the Japanese Changdao Foreign Firm's automobile repair shop. According to the report, the Investigation Team, after investigation by members Zhang Qingzhen and Wu Wangji, considered the case to be serious and cited the Garrison Headquarters to detain Wang Zhuchen. Members Wu and Zhang specifically visited Xuan Tiewu, Commander of the Garrison Headquarters, for this case. According to Member Zhang Qingzhen's report to our newspaper, there have been new developments in this case recently, and a large number of concealed German expatriate materials have been discovered as a result of this case, with a value of over 10 million yuan. The Investigation Team is still investigating as quickly as possible.

In order to understand the truth of the matter, the reporter specifically interviewed the plaintiff Wu Tianxiang and the defendant Wang Zhuchen. The details are compiled as follows: Wu Tianxiang, originally from Yangzhou, is 58 years old this year. He has been engaged in the automobile business in this city for decades. In the 17th year of the Republic of China, he rented No. 2 Beihaining Road from Cao Baoxiang and opened the Xiangji Sino-American Automobile Company. After the "September 18th" Incident, Wu led his family to take refuge in his hometown of Yangzhou. The Sino-American Automobile Company was forcibly occupied by the Japanese Changdao Chunyi, who established the Changdao Foreign Firm's Automobile Repair Shop. After the victory, it was taken over by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters and managed by Wang Zhuchen, who also engaged in the automobile business and was the designated repair shop for the Garrison Headquarters. After Wu Tianxiang returned to Shanghai, he applied to the police bureau, the Garrison Headquarters, the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau, and other agencies to have the Sino-American Automobile Company returned. Although it was approved by the authorities, Wang still refused. After several negotiations, he was allowed to move in, but the two rooms downstairs were still filled with enemy-owned automobile materials. Wang took possession of these enemy-owned properties and moved them out to other rooms at night, and set up another manufacturing plant on Chuanguan Highway in Zhabei. According to Wu Tianxiang's report, the batch of materials that Wang Zhuchen recently transferred and concealed included: 600 automobile inner tubes, over 2,200 oil pump pipes, over 2,000 large and small cylinder beds, over 4,300 Kellerzi Lanlin, over 50 Tai Limu, 500 sets of command lights, 600 Pace Dayton, 1,500 fan belts, 900 Exxon locks, over 3,100 purple copper large and small cylinder beds, over 8,000 headlight glasses, 1,800 water tank rubber pipes, 260 pairs of complete headlights, 400 carburetors, 20 automobile motors, over 500 wind belts, over 2,000 chokes, 2,000 Tam chains, 30 Tom Polo, 15 Hali Mu, over 4,000 red copper cylinder beds, over 600 automobile inner tubes, and over a dozen 2-zhang-long thick rubber pipes, the value of which is truly shocking. And the transfer of concealed materials is still continuing.

Wang Zhuchen told the reporter yesterday afternoon that he is a graduate of Tongji University, studied aviation automobile mechanics in Germany, and served in the aviation industry for more than ten years. He was once the director of an aircraft factory. After the victory, he came to Shanghai and co-invested with friends Yu Wei and Hui Yuan to organize the Xinyou Automobile Repair Factory. Because there was no factory site, he borrowed the Changdao Repair Shop from the Garrison Headquarters, and the commissioner of the Ministry of Economic Affairs received the enemy Xingya Steel Factory, which was the designated repair shop for the Garrison Headquarters, repairing cars for free, and the Garrison Headquarters supplied automobile parts and necessary equipment, and showed various certificates, including a certificate on February 28 purchased five trucks from the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau for 6.1 million yuan. Wang also said: The technicians hired by his factory are all filled by Japanese and German prisoners, and the German Harson Bushi is a technical consultant. Ha has lived in China for more than 30 years and is very proficient in automobile technology.

### Sun Tianchangzhi's Case of Aiding the Enemy: Informant Exposes Crimes

[Our Newspaper's Report] In the case of the Korean Sun Tianchangzhi supplying enemy military materials, the informants Zhou Gan, Han Kaiyuan, and Zhou Qingrong hosted the local press at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon to report on Sun Tianchangzhi's various crimes, which can be divided into six items: (1) Collecting coins on behalf of the enemy, (2) Procuring military hardware and materials for the enemy, (3) Contracting to repair the Jindou arsenal for the enemy, (4) Manufacturing and repairing military equipment for the enemy, (5) Presenting four fighter planes to the Japanese government, (6) Occupying the British-owned Moteli Qin Hang (details have been recorded in our newspaper on August 8). At the beginning of the victory, the informant secretly reported to the relevant authorities, and a large number of military hardware and materials were sealed. Later, the Handling Bureau actually approved the unsealing and return of the materials, and Sun is still at large. Therefore, in addition to submitting a request to the Investigation Team for a thorough investigation, he will soon file a complaint with the judicial authorities and the highest authorities, and will certainly bring this war criminal to justice. Zhang Qingzhen, a member of the Investigation Team, summoned Sun Tianchangzhi to the team's office again at 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon to listen to Sun's defense, which lasted for more than two hours. According to Zhang Zhiben, the head of the country, the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau should not have lightly returned the sealed materials. The Investigation Team attaches great importance to this case and is currently working hard to collect evidence.

### Inauguration of the Municipal Council This Morning: Representative of the Wu Municipal Department, Minister Zhang, Supervises the Election of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker; Amendment of the Question of Councillors' Attendance Requires Internal Request

[Our Newspaper's Report] The inaugural meeting of the first Shanghai Municipal Council is scheduled to be held at No. 1 Daxi Road at 8:00 AM this morning. Councillors began reporting on the 10th, and as of last night, there were 174 people. Those who have not yet reported are Wang Xiaolai, Jin Tongyin, Xu Baohua, Zhu Hongyi, Zhu Wenqi, and Ji Yuanpu. Qian Songping, the municipal councillor of the Zhenru District, was elected on the 11th, but he cannot participate because he has not yet reported to the Ministry of the Interior for record. Zhu Wenbin of the Dachang District has already reported and replaced Duanmu Kai, who resigned. The convener and chairman of the conference is Mayor Wu Guozhen, so all invitations to the councillors have the word "Wu Jian" on them. The important section of the inaugural meeting is the election of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker, which will be held and the votes counted on the spot. The supervisor of the election was originally Minister of the Interior Zhang Lisheng, but he was unable to participate due to official business. He has telegraphed Mayor Wu to supervise the election on his behalf. The election method uses an anonymous joint record method, and each person must obtain more than half of the votes of the attendees to be elected. In the event of a tie, it will be decided by drawing lots. In addition, alternate municipal councillors requested to attend and speak. They went to the Municipal Government yesterday morning to petition Mayor Wu. The mayor explained from a legal point of view the reasons why they could not attend and speak. Moreover, in fact, it is impossible to accommodate them all due to the small venue. However, in the end, Mayor Wu still agreed to forward the question of attendance to the Ministry of the Interior for instructions.

[Another Report] Mayor Wu Guozhen visited the Shanghai Municipal Council venue on Daxi Road at around 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon and gave instructions on the layout of the venue. The venue can accommodate about 300 people. There are 18 rows of seats in front of the stage, with ten people in each row, for the councillors. The right side of the stage is for the press, the left side is for guests, and the back is for the audience. There are three rows in front of the councillors for foreign guests, and General Jilin and personnel from the consulates and diplomatic missions of various countries in Shanghai have been invited to participate. The heads of the party, government, military, and organizations of this city, and the members of the Municipal Government Advisory Committee, are also on the list of invitees. As for alternate councillors, the council stated that they can participate in the audience. The council has issued 70 audience passes to alternate councillors.

### Suspected Tomb of Zhao Zhuozhi Found in Dug Graves in Nanjing

Yesterday's report that the Penglai Road Police Station in Nanjing cracked a case of private excavation of ancient tombs and theft of funeral antiquities stated that the excavated tomb was that of Zhao Wenhua, the Ming Right Political Secretary. The Shanghai Municipal Gazetteer Museum is paying close attention to this matter and has conducted an investigation, which stated: (1) Zhao Wenhua was from Cixi, Zhejiang, and his remains would never be buried in Shanghai, and he never served as the Right Political Secretary. (2) The Shanghai person who served as the Right Political Secretary in the Ming Dynasty was Zhao Zhuo. The county gazetteer states that his tomb was in Xieqiao, which is close to the current excavation site. (3) Zhao Zhuo and Zhao Wenhua were contemporaries, but they did not rely on Yan Song. He Sanwei's Yun Jian Zhi Lue states that "in his twenty years in office, the entertainment of singers and prostitutes never entered his ears, and inappropriate things never entered his residence." (4) The report stated that there was originally an epitaph in the tomb, which has been destroyed. It is a pity that Zhao Zhuo's epitaph was written by Xu Jie and cannot be preserved today.

### The Lives of War Criminals Are Not Bad: Playing Ball to Pass the Time; Citizens Encouraged to Report on Chou Shang-hsi

Yesterday afternoon, a reporter took a car to the Jiangwan National Defense Ministry War Criminals Management Office to inquire about the current situation of Japanese residents and war criminals remaining in China.

The War Criminals Management Office was formerly the Prisoner of War Management Committee. Since its affiliation with the Ministry of National Defense, it has expanded its scope of work to become a national institution for investigating and managing war criminals. It is located in Gaojingmiao, Jiangwan. Director Zou Renzhi recently led a supervisory team to inspect the repatriation of Japanese prisoners of war in the Northeast under the ministry's order.

As of now, there are 1,117 Japanese people detained on suspicion of war crimes, most of whom are military police, approximately 700 or more. The Management Office has three detention centers: one in Xiqiushe, Wusong, which is exclusively for military police, and two in Gaojingmiao, which house generals and general war criminals respectively. Some of the detained generals, even though they have become prisoners, still remember their status and request to be accompanied by attendants. Therefore, more than one hundred Japanese who are not suspected of war crimes remain in the detention center to serve them.

These war criminals, except for being strictly prohibited from leaving and entering, enjoy a considerable degree of freedom within the camp. Their food and supplies are paid for by the government, and each month generals receive 800 yuan and soldiers 200 yuan in spending money. They have organized a mutual aid society and spend their time playing baseball and other sports every day. The Management Office holds an internal affairs inspection once a week and publishes a three-day propaganda bulletin, which, in addition to brief news, focuses mostly on correcting their thinking. It is said that the war criminals are very at ease under such management, and many have repented of their past actions. Therefore, some are voluntarily learning the national language, and some are self-reporting.

The War Criminals Management Office has four groups. The first group is responsible for general affairs. The second group is responsible for management, including security and propaganda. The third group is responsible for investigation and evidence gathering. The fourth group is responsible for researching and reviewing data and household registration. Among them are more than 20 Japanese staff members, all of whom were prisoners from the former Military Affairs Department Chongqing Prisoner of War Camp. After eight years of training, they have had a thorough understanding of ideology and are now responsible for organizing data and translating investigative intelligence.

The work of investigating war criminals is still very difficult. In addition to the lack of legally required evidence for many crimes, the Chinese people's fear of trouble and standing out makes it difficult for the work to proceed smoothly. Therefore, the War Criminals Management Office hopes that the people and relevant authorities can provide them with various kinds of assistance so that those war criminals who have committed wrongdoing can be punished as they deserve as soon as possible. Recently, the First Pacification Area Military Tribunal may be affiliated with the Ministry of National Defense, so there may be closer ties for the handling of war criminals in the future.

As for Japanese residents, most have been repatriated. Those currently remaining in Shanghai are so-called "technical personnel" employed by various agencies, together with their dependents, numbering approximately one thousand. The Japanese Residents Management Committee has long been disbanded, and these Japanese are no longer subject to any management except for the constraints of their employing agencies. (Shi)

### Relying on Enemy Power to Bully the People: Wang Xinghuai Sentenced to Eight Years; Pan Da and Ni Nongxiang to Be Sentenced on the 19th

[This newspaper report] Wang Xinghuai, the head of the plainclothes brigade of the 94th Regiment of the 24th Division of the puppet army, relied on enemy power to harm the local area and bully the people. Yesterday, the High Court sentenced him to eight years of imprisonment and eight years of deprivation of civil rights.

Two cases were concluded on the same day: (1) Pan Da, who held positions such as the Director of the Fourth Division of the Puppet Government's Special Service Headquarters, (2) Ni Nongxiang, Deputy Manager of "Li Tai Bank," in which Li Shiqun and others participated as shareholders. After the debate in both cases was concluded, it was decided that both would be sentenced on the 19th.

Xia Zhongming After being prosecuted by the High Procuratorate, the High Court held its first hearing yesterday afternoon. Xia wore a light gray Paris long gown, with a small checkered cotton short shirt and pants underneath, yellow leather shoes, a slightly curved back, a thin face, and short hair. He stated that he was 45 years old, from Shanghai, a graduate of Tokyo University of Commerce, Japan, and previously lived at No. 16 Zhaofeng Village, Yuyuan Road. Before the war, he was the Chief Clerk of the Shanghai Police Department. After the war, he was the Director of Military Supplies of the Songhu National Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Corps. After being arrested, he joined the puppet organization in August of the 28th year of the Republic [1939], and served as the leader of the Special Service Headquarters, the Deputy Minister of the Puppet Investigation and Statistics Department, and the Director of the Shanghai Office. After being questioned in court and witness Gao Jimin was summoned, the defense lawyer Chen Zhen stood up and provided twelve favorable documentary pieces of evidence. The court ordered a change of date for further questioning.

Feng Jie also underwent a retrial by the High Court yesterday afternoon. He denied that he had served as a member of the Puppet Central Executive Committee and the Deputy Minister of the Puppet Propaganda Department, claiming that he served as a member of the Puppet Relief Committee from December of the 30th year of the Republic [1941] to February of the 31st year of the Republic [1942], and as the Director of the Shanghai Office of the Puppet Propaganda Department in October of the 31st year of the Republic [1942]. He later served as the Director of the Puppet Shanghai Propaganda Department and the General Manager of the "China Film Company" until the victory. The court debate in this case was changed to a later date for further questioning.

On the same day, the investigation of Zheng Chengxue, General Manager of "China Trading Company," who purchased food on behalf of the puppet army, He, Deputy Chief Executive of the Puppet Oil and Food Unified Allocation Office, and Zhang Guangpei, Manager of the Puppet Xinghua Bank in Changsha, Hunan, and member of the Puppet Changsha Municipal Design Committee, etc., were all changed to a later date for further questioning after the questioning.

### Provisional Meeting of the Labor Association's Directors in Shanghai: Recommended Tao Baichuan, etc., to Go to the Capital to Present Four Demands; Sent Personnel to Chongqing to Investigate the Inside Story of the Forced Occupation

A total of eleven people attended, including Zhu Xuefan, Zhou Xuexiang, Shui Xiangyun, Tao Baichuan, Li Jianhua, Wang Jiashu, Lu Keming, Gu Xizhang, Wang Zhenbai, and Xiao Pusong. The directors expressed their opinions enthusiastically, and all agreed that the use of force to illegally occupy the association's welfare society and arrest staff members, which infringes on human rights and disrupts social order, not only should the perpetrators bear all legal responsibilities, but also it is necessary to investigate which agency instigated or approved it, and file an administrative lawsuit. (According to the General Labor Union, it was "ordered to take over" and "approved for takeover," etc.) Finally, four resolutions were passed: (1) Send Zhang Tianmin, director of the welfare stock, to Chongqing to investigate the inside story of the forced occupation, rescue the arrested staff members, and question the local authorities.

### ERRRA and UNRRA Agreed on a Memorandum Regarding Educational Post-War Rehabilitation: If Educational Institutions in Various Provinces and Cities Need Books and Equipment, They Can Report to the Ministry of Education for Submission to ERRRA for Assistance

[This newspaper report] Regarding the post-war relief of cultural and educational institutions, the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (ERRRA) has agreed with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) to assist in the rescue of Taiwan materials and requested the Ministry of Education to instruct all educational institutions across the country to list the books and equipment they need and submit them to the ministry for overall submission to ERRRA for application. Regarding the categories of supplies and the scope of assistance, a memorandum has been agreed upon with UNRRA, and UNRRA has ordered its representatives in various regions to comply. Therefore, educational departments and bureaus in various provinces and cities and other educational institutions can apply directly to the Ministry of Education for books and equipment. The following is a memorandum agreed upon by ERRRA and UNRRA regarding post-war education:

Two Types of Assistance Methods

UNRRA is willing to provide assistance for post-war affairs of educational institutions in various member countries. The assistance methods are divided into two types: (1) Books and Publications: A special fund has been designated to purchase a considerable number of specialist books and publications that contribute to: A. Promoting the country's production and utilization capacity of post-war relief materials; B. Protecting those with intellectual and physical disabilities, pregnant women, nursing mothers, children, and the disabled; C. Prevention and management of infectious diseases; D. Establishment, maintenance, and administration of health and welfare facilities. This plan will continue to receive material supplements due to donations from private organizations. (2) Supplies and Equipment: UNRRA will make every effort to supply laboratories, instruments, machinery, and items related to the following points, which are required for the estimated needs of various countries: A. Experimental supplies for researchers who manufacture post-war relief products; B. Those that ensure that the manufactured products meet standards; C. Training those who manufacture and use products; D. Those who diagnose diseases; E. Medical personnel who receive advanced training. UNRRA can also assist in purchasing and processing other equipment that is applicable and beneficial to the recovery of educational institutions in various member countries. This plan was originally designated to assist universities, but Washington has also instructed that UNRRA is also happy to consider the equipment and materials needed for agricultural post-war rehabilitation in China's free areas and for secondary school refugee schools that can immediately benefit the post-war relief policy. Washington is eager to receive a list of the materials needed in China to determine the extent of assistance UNRRA can provide. Representatives from the Ministry of Education, ERRRA, and UNRRA have formed a joint committee in Shanghai to prepare to compile this application and prepare for the distribution of supplies upon arrival. ERRRA has asked the Ministry of Education to be responsible for surveying the needs of educational institutions across the country, and this work is in progress. Some institutions have already submitted applications to the ministry, and the rest will continue to be launched. ERRRA and UNRRA branch chiefs should immediately assist the preparation of applications for the agencies in their jurisdiction and may appoint commissioners and local university representatives to discuss the required materials.

Four Points to Note

The ERRRA and UNRRA headquarters especially hope to receive reports from individual institutions in various regions, requesting supplies of the above-mentioned books and equipment that are considered to be effective in post-war relief programs. When preparing for this report and discussing with representatives of various agencies or the Ministry of Education, ERRRA and UNRRA personnel should pay attention to the following points: (1) All books and items applied for to UNRRA must be used in educational work related to ERRRA and UNRRA post-war relief programs. (2) The funds for purchasing this equipment must still be included in the original budget of various countries, so the scope of assistance will be limited to the following institutions: A. Educational institutions in liberated areas; B. Institutions that moved inland and returned to their original sites in liberated areas; C. Institutions in free areas whose laboratories were directly destroyed by air strikes. Books are purchased with special funds and are not subject to the above restrictions. (3) All institutions applying for assistance should clearly express their desire and ability to immediately use the books and materials they receive. If institutions whose houses have been destroyed cannot accept and use the distributed materials, their reports should also explain the methods of using the construction and repair costs and the estimated completion date. Reports of difficulties from faculty and staff groups are also welcome. (4) UNRRA will hardly be able to supply sufficient materials and equipment for all the needs of Chinese educational institutions, so a priority allocation method will be established for the types of equipment and among the institutions. Please submit a report on the urgent needs of the institutions in each district to determine the priority.

### Results of Industry and Commerce Petition: Ministries Respond to Fifteen Questions; Important Matters Require Instructions from Highest Authorities

[Our Dispatch] In addition to the groups that returned to Shanghai from Nanjing on Saturday afternoon, Sunday morning, and yesterday (i.e., the 12th) morning and noon, another group led by Shou Yicheng and others, the final batch, arrived in Shanghai on the 5:30 PM flight from Nanjing yesterday afternoon. According to them, the journey was arduous and regrettably unproductive. However, the two financial and economic ministries held symposiums, sincerely engaging in discussions with the delegation, which was quite pleasant. Minister Wang, after returning to Beijing on the afternoon of the 11th, immediately invited the delegation for talks. The Ministry of Finance even made an exception to work on Sunday for this purpose, which showed particular (blank). Leaders of the business community in Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and other places responded in unison, encouraging the delegation. The heads of various ministries stated that they would be responsible for resolving the difficulties of industry and commerce, and that given the seriousness of the situation, they would not give empty assurances. However, the more important issues still need to be referred to the highest authorities and discussed with relevant agencies. The results of their petitions, that is, the responses of the heads of various ministries (including the Ministries of Finance, Economy, and Social Affairs), are recorded below. According to news from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, a meeting of the heads of various industries will be convened to report everything.

(1) The organization of the United Relief Agency was established to meet wartime needs. Whether it should be abolished or how it should be improved now that the environment has changed needs to be studied, but it still needs to be submitted to the highest authorities for approval. (2) There should be special funds for industrial loans, as well as incentives for export trade. These matters concern the actual needs of finance and industry and commerce, and should be carefully reviewed by the government and the business community before a decision can be made. Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has paid special attention to loans for small and medium-sized factories and has drafted specific measures. In the future, it is planned to establish industrial and commercial supervision offices in important commercial ports. If implemented, the most effective measures will be taken to cooperate with relevant parties to handle industrial loans. To avoid inflation, in-kind loans will also be arranged as much as possible.

(3) The import tax on non-essential and luxury goods should be increased, and export taxes should be reduced to moderately protect nascent industries. The Ministries of Economy and Finance are revising tax rates. Efforts to strengthen customs anti-smuggling work have also been made.

(4) The foreign exchange grading system and the import and export linkage system have been difficult to implement. However, trials can be conducted within possible limits. The Central Trust Bureau is responsible for the purchase of raw silk, which has been approved by President Song. The purchase of tea leaves concerns barter trade with the Soviet Union and sales to the United Kingdom and the United States, and the same example can be followed in the future.

(5) Regarding the establishment of a rehabilitation and industrial investment company to utilize foreign capital, the principle is feasible. However, the first step should be to guide domestic idle funds into the right track, and the second step is to utilize overseas Chinese and foreign capital.

(6) The draft of the Sino-American Commercial Treaty has been drafted and is under review. There is also a temporary commercial arrangement with Canada. The main purpose is to promote international economic cooperation. Tariff barriers should still be avoided.

(7) The restrictions on mortgage loans for real estate should be relaxed. The authorities will consider and approve mortgage loans for production and construction projects under the premise that they do not hinder current laws and regulations.

(8) Illegal harassment in the collection of direct taxes will be strictly prohibited. The business tax law should levy taxes separately on manufacturing, wholesale, and sales. The authorities are in the process of drafting it. The stamp tax is a certificate tax. Calculating it based on the turnover in the books is obviously inconsistent with the law and should be corrected.

(9) Business license taxes are limited by law to industries that contain regulatory characteristics and require increased control. Any excesses should be stopped.

(10) For goods subject to goods tax that are exported, taxes can be refunded upon export. The new tax law does include cosmetics as a category, but daily necessities are not included.

(11) The request for exemption of business tax for the handmade cotton weaving industry and whether to restrict the import of candies and biscuits will be considered.

(12) Industrialists returning from the rear should be given priority in allocating factories.

(13) The requests from various cotton textile industries and cotton yarn and cotton cloth business associations to return the enemy and puppet-confiscated yarn and cloth, and the request from retail stores to return the retained goods will be considered.

(14) Deep concern is expressed regarding the disposal of enemy and puppet property.

(15) Importance should be attached to factory management rights, and labor-management coordination should continue to be promoted. Unreasonable demands for wage increases by workers are unacceptable.

### Unified Bonds, Red Tickets Increased, Both A and B Declined Weakly

Government bonds continued to be handled according to the old plan as the Ministry of Finance held a lottery for redemption of principal. Influenced by the political situation, they inevitably trended downwards. Speculation was slightly high. Unified C was relatively stable, hovering around 640 yuan after opening at 620 yuan. As a result, it fell by 20 yuan compared to last Saturday. A and B saw an increase in red tickets and fell by 40 yuan. Unified D was relatively stable, and Unified E also fell slightly by 20 yuan.

### Pessimistic Outlook for Industry and Commerce; Stock Market Slump

The Shanghai stock market became more pessimistic yesterday due to the deteriorating political situation and the outlook for industry and commerce, causing widespread anxiety. Selling increased slightly. Although the market was relatively stable at the opening, it was difficult to sustain. The morning's high prices were 708 yuan for Yongsheng Yarn, 4,050 yuan for Mei Ya, 228 yuan for Jingfu, 225 yuan for Xinguang, and 168 yuan for Qinxing. Afterwards, prices gradually fell, and sentiment deteriorated, making it impossible to rally. Although there were many struggles in the middle, the market plunged to low prices near noon. Yongsheng Yarn saw 665 yuan, Mei Ya 3,730 yuan, Jingfu 203 yuan, Xinguang 202 yuan, and Qinxing 155 yuan. Afterwards, there was a slight consolidation. Small and medium-sized unpopular stocks and veteran stocks were difficult to recover and remained slightly lower. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Yongsheng Yarn fell by 19 yuan, Mei Ya fell slightly by 20 yuan, and the three small popular stocks such as Jingfu also fell by 5 yuan to 8 yuan. Although the decline of small and medium-sized unpopular stocks was not large, veteran stocks were relatively stable.

Foreign stocks remained sluggish yesterday. There was no transaction at first. Later, with sporadic floating orders, people were eager to sell. Yisha was opened at 7,700 to 7,800 yuan. Others followed suit and had more transactions. The rise and fall of each stock varied depending on the supply and demand situation. As a result, Yiguang Yisha and Jardine Matheson each fell by half a percent or so. Yibiao, British United, and Asia fell slightly, while steel and paper were flat.

### Coal Market Transactions Sparse

The white coal trend in the coal market was hovering. Local actual sales remained normal. Goods arrived continuously, and although the quantity was scattered, it was sufficient for the needs of the city. Therefore, there was guaranteed supply for every demand in the market, and prices were quite (blank). The bituminous coal process was extremely calm, and transactions were also quite (blank). There was a lack of buyers for the coal allocated by the Coal Merchants Joint Office, so the market price and the allocation price have already (blank). The arrival of local charcoal was abundant, and the market continued to fall.

### Yarn Prices Rise Universally

The yarn market was even stronger yesterday. Prices of 20-count yarns of all grades rose by 20,000 to 30,000, and prices of 42-count yarns rose by as much as 50,000 to 60,000. Among the guest traders, the destocking in Guangdong and southern China was not high, and there was no movement in Beijing and the interior. However, the northern traders favored the 20-count Red Kui Star, absorbing a lot of it. Sentiment was therefore strengthened. As usual, Fangjian opened its yarn sales at noon, with (blank) of 20-count and Shuangshe of 42-count available for sale, which was (blank). Because the market in Tianjin was thriving, sentiment was raised, and the exhausted and sluggish (blank) was also inspired. However, there were small orders from the north, Guangdong, Fujian, and other places, so the market turned for the better, resulting in an increase of 500 yuan to 1,000 yuan.

### Restructuring of Yokohama Specie Bank

[United Press Tokyo 11th] According to today's news from the Kyodo News Agency, the Yokohama Specie Bank will be completely restructured. Before the war, the bank had branches in various countries. It is reported that the bank's capital will reach 50,000,000 yen (approximately 3,333,333 US dollars).

### Strong Buying Interest in British and Indian Teas; Peak Prices Emerge in Hangzhou Tea Market

In the tea market, the destocking of shops and guest traders in this street remains incessant, so transactions are both active and comfortable, and the market is exceptionally strong. As for the foreign tea market, the buying interest of British and Indian tea merchants is growing, with steady transactions of Tanyang black tea, Fujian small kind, old Qimen, and old Chouzhen. As the market inventory of old Zhongchouzhen is relatively low, the sellers are trying to raise prices, and the market is soaring. As a result, prices rose rapidly to 56,000 yuan per dan until the close, and the prices remained solid. According to people in the industry, prices in the Hangzhou tea market are rising sharply, and it is not easy to smoothly collect old Qimen tea even at a price of 130,000 yuan per dan. The reason for this is that the two British companies, Xiehe and Jardine Matheson, have been collecting tea in that area since last week, and sentiment is getting better and better. Judging from the current situation, the future seems to continue to rise.

### High Quality Japonica is Strong

Yesterday, 5,000 to 6,000 shi of rice arrived from both the north and the south. The sales in stores were moving but not strong. High quality rice remains strong, while medium quality rice seems to be less energetic. Lower grade indica rice also tends to be soft. However, as the stock of Baiyuan rice is low, prices have risen by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. After several days of decline, the price of flour has become short. Stores took advantage of the opportunity to purchase it, so sales became active and prices rose by 200 to 300 yuan. The north is still sourcing white wheat, while Fujian, Shantou, and Xiamen are selecting and purchasing high quality wheat. New soybeans are scarce and have rebounded by 500 to 600 yuan. Stores are selling vegetable oil in small quantities, and the factory is supplying some soybean and rapeseed oil. The market is strong by 1,000 yuan. Bran from Changzhou and Wuxi is stable.

### Artificial Silk Rises by 100,000; Silk Goods Still Show No Improvement

Yesterday, the silk market followed the rise in gold prices. Artificial silk No. 120 "Tianqiao Youguang" opened at 1.66 million yuan, later reaching 1.7 million yuan before closing. In the afternoon, market sentiment was even more buoyant, with demand exceeding supply, and 1.73 million yuan still couldn't secure a purchase. This represents a substantial increase of 100,000 yuan compared to the end of last week. "Zapai" (mixed brand) No. 120 "Youguang" also followed suit, rising by approximately 100,000 yuan. No. 75 "Jinji Banguang" (Golden Rooster Semi-gloss), due to its scarcity, became even more expensive, with offers of 1.72 million yuan still failing to secure supply. No. 120 "Banguang" (Semi-gloss) was less impressive, increasing by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan compared to last Saturday. No. 150 "Youguang" increased by 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. Although factory silk trading houses showed some willingness to accept offers, holders of goods were still waiting and unwilling to sell cheaply, resulting in no transactions. User silk, ordinary goods, 74.5% to 5 "dan" heads, traded between 1.95 million and 2 million yuan, with another "dan" trading at approximately 1.85 million to 1.9 million yuan, an increase of 70,000 to 80,000 yuan compared to last weekend. "Gan Jing" (dried warp) was ignored, with asking prices for available goods at around 1.35 million yuan per "dan." Sales of silk goods have not shown any improvement, so even though raw materials are expensive, the selling price of finished products is still difficult to increase accordingly. "Hua Jin Chou" (Chinese brocade crepe) traded at 2,100 yuan yesterday, only 30 to 40 yuan higher than last Saturday.

### New Pharmaceutical Industry Requests Restoration of Bayer Drug Allocation

Since the Enemy Property Administration switched to a bidding method for various Bayer pharmaceutical products, various parties have been vying to purchase them, driving up prices. Pharmacies in other areas all felt a sense of regret at being unable to acquire them. Shi Zhifu, chairman of the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, specifically telegraphed the administration, requesting the restoration of allocation. An excerpt of the original text is as follows: The various batches of stored drugs from Bayer and Schering, from January to June of this year, were gradually allocated to pharmacies in the city at a fair price by the Bayer Plant Liquidation Office, allowing the market price to remain stable. Since July, a bidding method has been adopted. The purpose of the bidding method is to obtain high prices, but bidders only value high prices, and buyers are bound to pay high prices, which will inevitably lead to rising prices, which is undeniable. Our association sincerely requests that your administration immediately cancel the bidding method and restore the previous practice of fair-price allocation. If it is said that the quantity of each type of drug varies and cannot be allocated in groups, our association specifically offers the following remedial measures: 1. For those with sufficient quantities, allocate according to the original number of groups. 2. For those with scarce quantities, allocate according to the existing number of groups, or select other drugs with similar sales and equal prices to supplement the insufficient groups. If there are concerns about unfairness, a lottery can be used to determine the allocation. Whether this is appropriate, we respectfully request your consideration.

### The Situation Stimulates People's Hearts; Gold Market Buying Spree Erupts; US Dollar Also Rises by 115 Yuan

The market opened at 1.935 million yuan, and demand exceeded supply for a time, gradually rising to 2.01 million yuan. As pressure gradually increased, some people also closed out positions at high prices, causing a slight decline. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 115 taels at a price of 1.98 million yuan. After that, it once fell back to 1.97 million yuan, but because people's hearts were still firm, there were many supporters after the low, and at noon, it still approached the 2 million yuan mark. In the afternoon, there was continued progress, ending at a high price of 2.02 million yuan. As a result, it rose by 94,000 yuan compared to last Saturday. Jewelry was priced at 2.115 million yuan.

### US Newspapers Debate Troop Withdrawal Issue; Majority Support Continued Presence in China

[Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Washington, 11th] The New York World-Telegram, one of the major newspapers in the Scripps-Howard chain, recently published an article opposing the withdrawal of US troops from China. The gist of the article is: the demand for the withdrawal of US troops is a comprehensive propaganda offensive by the CCP, attempting to influence the US government and people. In reality, their hope is to replace them with Soviet troops, Soviet military advisors, and delegations. The newspaper also speculates that even if Chairman Chiang invites the CCP to participate in the central government, the CCP will still not abandon its strategy of creating a civil war in the future, because although the Soviet Union has repeatedly stated that it does not support the implementation of communism internationally and hopes that China will become a strong and democratic country, the ultimate goal of the CCP is still to gradually make the entire China red. At the same time, the Daily Worker, another extreme representing the Communist Party of America, criticized President Truman's China policy in an editorial, strongly urging the withdrawal of US troops from China, even saying that the civil war in China would cause a third world war, hoping to create alarm.

[US Information Service, Washington, 11th] The Dallas News discussed the role of the United States on the Chinese stage, stating: "Although our mediation policy has not made much progress so far, it may continue. However, we must pay attention to avoiding military assistance to one or both sides to avoid prolonging the conflict that we are trying to prevent. A peaceful and rebuilt China is a potential for world stability and is especially valuable to us because it can serve as a strong and friendly country on the other side of our Pacific." The Washington Star reviewed the reasons for the US military's presence in China and stated: If the US military withdraws, the CCP will take the opportunity to enter and replace it, and "become another stimulus to internal strife." The Star concluded: "These issues must be considered when dealing with our plans for the military."

Radio commentator Shi Zhou broadcasted:

"The US military will never withdraw from China until the Marine Corps being bound and attacked has not been fully and satisfactorily resolved." Shi Wen continued, "The Communist Party delays the investigation of this incident, and at the same time fabricates rumors accusing the Marine Corps of fighting alongside the National Army against them. This kind of fabricated news is the routine procedure of the two sides of the Chinese struggle. In fact, the Marine Corps has never fought alongside the National Army. Chinese people value face more than people in other countries, they all know that if we withdraw our armed forces because of being struck, it will be a great loss of face for us. It is difficult to understand why the Communist Party adopted violent means to force us to withdraw from China. They may think that doing so will make American public opinion demand the withdrawal of troops stationed abroad in order to live for a foreign government, but the Communist Party misjudged the country’s reaction, because our Marine Corps will never withdraw due to danger, and most Americans do not agree to station troops. The United States' policy was originally to withdraw troops stationed in China within this year. The Communist Party's ambush of the Marine Corps may have delayed the withdrawal of US troops, but in any case, it will not accelerate their withdrawal."

An editorial in the New York Herald Tribune stated: "Regardless of the dangers of the US Marine Corps stationed in North China, in today's situation, ordering them to withdraw would be a mistake." The condemnation of the recall of the Marine Corps propaganda here is issued to the following types of people: (1) A small but very influential group of free people; (2) Not only the Communist Party of China, but also the Communist Parties of the Soviet Union and the United States. Because the communists see the US Marine Corps stationed in China as a major obstacle to the conspiracy of the CCP to rule more land, if the Marine Corps withdraws from China today, the result will be to make China's politics. Military, economic and other aspects are in chaos, transportation lines will also be cut off, and most of China's industrial production, which is urgently needed to restore eight years of war, will also stop immediately. If the Marine Corps withdraws from China, it will make the Soviet Union believe that the United States no longer pays attention to building a strong and independent China, but this is precisely the main reason why we engaged in the Pacific War. The Soviet Union, which desperately wants to fill the power gap in its border forces, will make China another Poland. The United States does not allow Japan to carve up China with a population of 450 million, nor should it allow other countries to rule it. Therefore, the presence of the Marine Corps in China is necessary at present. The most sound approach is to strive to create a "coalition government" so that free people can grasp the balanced power. This kind of government can make China survive independently, outside the power of the Soviet Union, the United States and other countries.

### Memories of the Battle of Shanghai

— Yang Hu

Today, ten years ago, under the wise decision-making of the supreme leader, our Chinese nation unveiled the prelude to the unprecedented all-out anti-Japanese sacred war in the Shanghai area - the "Battle of Shanghai." Although the duration of this prelude was only more than eighty days, it laid a valuable foundation for the final victory. In this battle alone, the patriotism and spirit of sacrifice shown by our nation gave the enemy a severe blow to their contemptuous view of our nation's traditions and inspired the strong consciousness of the country's long-term resistance, winning the attention of international friendly countries. Therefore, the Battle of Shanghai is the most glorious chapter in the history of the Chinese nation's rejuvenation.

On the day the sacred war broke out, I happened to be serving again in the Shanghai Garrison Command and was ordered to concurrently take charge of the Shanghai Garrison. The former's main task was to assist the front-line military, while the latter's was to ensure local security. The two complement each other and cannot be overemphasized. Therefore, the principle I followed in performing my duties at that time was to assist the military and civilians in strengthening the anti-war forces. The military was the center of everything, while political, social, diplomatic, propaganda, and fortification matters, as well as supply, rescue, refugee accommodation, material preservation, and traffic transportation, must also advance in unison in order to achieve the full-scale combat of the military and civilians. However, I felt that my talent was thin and my duties were heavy, so I was deeply fearful and knew the heavy responsibility of revolutionary soldiers and revolutionary party members to the country, and I dared not have any intention of fear. On the eve of the outbreak of the war, Yang Zeng was summoned to Beijing, and after being personally instructed by the supreme commander, I felt an even greater responsibility and increased my determination to serve the country and the party.

Before our army reached the planned front-line position, the task assigned to me was to command the local military police to ensure the forward position and wait for the arrival of the large army in the rear and enter the planned front-line position. This forward mission made me deeply vigilant, for fear that it would not be easy to complete, which would lead to a major military opportunity. There were several points: First, the number of local military police troops, the quality and equipment were far inferior to the enemy's, and most of them had no combat experience. Second, the forward mission was to ensure the position in terms of strategic tactics, and it was not allowed to start a war first. Third, the enemy was in an active position, and I had to avoid starting a war first. The enemy and my areas were closely intertwined. I not only had to occupy the forward position in a timely manner, but also had to cover the large army that arrived after entering the front-line position without being detected by the enemy. Based on the above reasons, the execution of the forward mission at that time was extremely difficult, but it finally completed the mission smoothly, making the planned strategic and tactical actions gradually unfold favorably. In fact, it relied on the supreme commander's moral power and the command of commanders at all levels, and the lower ranks were united with the military and civilians, and the enemy was filled with the same hatred. After the official start of the war, my forward mission became a side and rear warning. The above-mentioned comprehensive mission with the military as the center began because the war of the 20th century was a total war and a comprehensive war, so in the execution of the comprehensive mission, a wealth of local manpower and material resources were used to assist the progress of the war zone. At the beginning, under the principle of the Three People's Principles, the use of national diplomacy benefited our entire strategy and tactics. At that time, there were insightful people who felt the inevitable coming of the Second International War and deeply knew that it was beneficial to me. Today, the enemy's defeat and victory will undoubtedly belong to me. It is the supreme leader's divine wisdom to exert national power and use diplomacy to obtain this final victory and win eternal glory for the nation.

Today, looking back, the smooth unfolding of the Battle of Shanghai at that time cannot but thank the local leaders, all the people, the military police compatriots, and the allied friends for the great assistance they gave in the battle, so that I have always been safe under the heavy burden. However, I think that the sacrifices of the soldiers and the suffering of the people in the eight-year war are immeasurable. The fruits of victory exchanged for such a huge price are becoming more and more difficult to build the country. Natural disasters and man-made disasters are said to be painful. The great cause of national construction is obstructed. Our national military and civilians must once again give full play to the patriotic spirit of the Battle of Shanghai. Under the leadership of the supreme leader Chairman Chiang, we must step up our efforts to complete the great cause of national construction. Although I am old and retired, I am willing to follow the national military and civilians to collect my last patriotic spirit.

### Regarding the Robbery of Ships

Editor: I read in yesterday's newspaper about the robbery of the Shanghai-Tongban Hangli ship during its voyage. The losses to passengers were not small, and the pirates sailed away in a sailboat afterward. I think, after the loss of the ship, was the machine broken by the pirates? According to the report, it can still be driven afterward, then I think that when the pirates were boarding the sailboat to escape, just when they were leaving the ship, they could use a tie ship to slam into the wooden sailboat, causing them to capsize into the sea, and after the weapons fell into the sea, they were useless, then save them out and detain them to the water patrol team to deal with them. This method is risky, but in this way, the pirates will be caught off guard and eventually fall into the net. This is just a childish idea. The fundamental solution is that the authorities should strictly prevent such things from happening again, so that merchants and passengers will be safe and sound. (Wang Jingzhong)

### This Day – Commemorating "August 13th"

After the Zhagou Bridge incident, although everyone felt that a storm was coming, no one dared to say when it would expand into a nationwide war. Shanghai was already extremely tense because of the successive killings of Japanese such as Zhongshan Xiuxiong and Xiongsheng. When the Hongqiao Airport incident occurred on the afternoon of August 9, all the citizens of Shanghai had a premonition that "this day" would definitely come immediately.

When Mayor Yu Hongjun and Japanese Consul General Okamoto and naval commander Honda negotiated, many angry citizens felt that this negotiation was superfluous. We have retreated for so many years, do we still have to endure it! In the end, Mayor Yu resolutely rejected the Japanese request. The atmosphere became more and more tense, but there was no fear. On the contrary, everyone was looking forward to it with a burning heart - welcoming "this day"!

On August 12, Mayor Yu attended a joint meeting of consuls from various countries and formally declared to the world that he refused the ridiculous demand to withdraw Chinese troops from Chinese territory.

Iron gates and sandbags were piled up around the concession. British troops, French troops, police... were densely deployed behind the gates. People walking on the road seemed to quicken their pace.

Occasionally, the sound of a train blowing its whistle came with the evening breeze, and every Shanghai citizen felt another surge of excitement. Because everyone knew that in these carriages were countless heroic warriors, pouring into Shanghai. The anger that had been in my heart since the Sino-Japanese War was finally about to erupt!

Night fell on Shanghai, and the anger of the Huangpu River was boiling.

There was silence on both sides of the barbed wire fence, but the soldiers behind the barbed wire were stepping up their vigilance. The starlight was faintly projected on the hat badge of the Blue Sky and White Sun, and the hands holding the rifle were slightly sweating. This time, the blood debt of the September 18th Incident and the January 28th Incident can be settled.

Minute by minute, second by second, passed quietly. It was twelve o'clock, and there was nothing unusual.

Minute by minute, second by second, August 12 passed quietly, followed by August 13, 1937.

"Dao Yitian" has finally arrived! (Pingzhai)

### Answering Readers – Medicine and Health

(1) Jing Yuan asked Yu, who works in a certain company, while colleague A suffers from syphilis. It is said that his body is covered with sores, but they are covered by clothing and not easily discovered. Also, colleague B has scabies on his hands, which is said to have been transmitted by colleague A. After Yu heard this rumor, he was very panicked. He urgently wants to understand the transmission routes of syphilis and the re-transmission of scabies. However, there are many rumors. Some say that items that have been sat on or used by the patient and are still warm are easily transmitted; some say that it can be transmitted through diet; and some books say that syphilis bacteria can survive and be transmitted in water... all kinds of statements, making it even more difficult to know where to start. Therefore, I am writing to you, sir. I respectfully await your guidance.

[Dr. Zhang Zhongming replied] Skin diseases such as syphilis and scabies are transmitted through direct contact, but cannot be transmitted through diet. (2) He Jingru asked (1) Every other day, there is an unusual odor coming from both armpits. Is this what is commonly called fox odor? What is the cause? (2) Is there a personal way to treat it? (3) It is said that it can be treated with electrotherapy. Is this true? Can electrotherapy be used to treat this disease in various hospitals in Shanghai?

[Dr. Zhang Zhongming replied] (1) This is fox odor, which is caused by excessive development of sweat glands in both armpits. (2) The personal treatment method is to use talcum powder to keep the sweat dry. (3) The root treatment method is to remove the sweat glands in both armpits. Electrotherapy can also be used. (3) Wu Muping asked about a relative, Mr. So-and-so, 22 years old, unmarried. He suffered from joint pain two years ago, with a limp in his right foot and weakness in his right hand. His thighs and arms were thin. A Chinese medicine doctor diagnosed it as rheumatism, and taking supplements was effective. The following year, it relapsed, with symptoms as before. He was cured by a Western doctor, and the year after that, it relapsed as usual, and he also had back pain from time to time. It has been better and worse since then. In the 32nd year of the Republic of China, he had already studied [unclear] and in August, [unclear] could not [unclear]. Doctors mostly diagnosed it as bone shifting and said that there was no specific medicine. He had to use a plaster bed for treatment, but he was not sure, so he did not do it. Please ask (1) What is this actually a disease? (2) Is there any way to treat it?

[Dr. Zhang Shenming replied] This disease seems to be chronic rheumatism. Try using sodium salicylate [unclear], which may be effective.

### Xie Zhongshi's Rickshaw Puller

Two Boxes of Glass Returned to Their Original Owner

Editor: On the morning of August 7, Mr. Xu, an employee of our shop, went to Fujian Road to purchase two boxes of glass, which were placed on a tricycle and returned to the shop. When the car reached a crowded place in the middle of the road, it was blocked from the car by two or three feet of sight. When it was able to pass through, the car had already been lost. It was considered to have escaped [unclear]. Liu Dian reported to the shop, which was very disappointing. But at 3:00 p.m., the respectable rickshaw puller delivered the goods to our shop. He said that he had also been looking for a long time and had asked the wholesaler for our shop's name and detailed address, and had found it. When I gave him a considerable reward, I thought that the rickshaw puller had this kind of righteousness, which is really admirable and is worthy of being considered old-fashioned. I am a reader who is not good at writing. I was moved by the honest Sishuchefu, and I submitted a manuscript to you, which is not up to my ability. For the honest, it is appropriate to improve the social atmosphere. I would like to wish you peace. Sincerely yours, Qu Sizheng, 35 An'nan Road, Ruikang Hardware Store, August 8.

### If Your Child Throws a Tantrum

— Yu Renfeng

Children are important members of a family, sufficient to enhance the affection and love between husband and wife; however, if there is a child who is both annoying and prone to tantrums, it will instead cause disputes between husband and wife.

However, a child's proneness to tantrums is not innate; some are caused by various environmental factors, for which parents bear a great responsibility. Parents should constantly observe them, find the reasons why they throw tantrums, and then apply fundamental solutions.

(1) Keep children constantly busy, and they will not have time to throw tantrums. Therefore, it is best to give children toys that involve creativity to play with. On the one hand, it can promote the child's creative spirit; on the other hand, it can give them the pleasure of completing something difficult. Wouldn't that be killing several birds with one stone? However, it is also important to note whether the toy is too difficult. If it is too difficult, the child will overexert their brainpower and damage their health, and failure will cause them frustration and fear of trying?

(2) Treat children like adults. We often assume that we don't need to respect children, and we can casually take away the things they are playing with. However, children also have their rights and desires. How can we take away something they are enjoying so much? No wonder they will resist and get angry. Even if they are playing with something unreasonable, don't snatch it away from their hands immediately. Always treat the child with kind words!

(3) Be consistent in how you treat your child. Once, I saw a child running around wearing his father's shoes. I found it very funny, and his mother also laughed heartily. A few days later, he wore his father's new shoes again and started running and jumping. His mother, fearing that he would ruin the shoes, shouted and snatched the shoes away, and the child started crying. Why is it that doing the same thing is welcomed the first time but prohibited the second time? No wonder the child will be confused and throw a tantrum. We must pay attention to this point. When a child does something unreasonable and funny, we should give a warning the first time, not laugh at him the first time and scold him the second time. Even if what he does is extremely funny, we should laugh first and then give a lesson, telling him not to do it again next time, or he will be punished. Then, when he does it the second time, even if he is scolded, he will feel it is deserved and will not throw a tantrum out of confusion.

(4) Children will naturally seek to extremely satisfy their desires. If they are not given guidance, they will continue to do so. Therefore, as parents, when a child does something too much, you should immediately show an unpleasant expression, making him understand that what he is doing is not liked by his parents. At the same time, explain the wrongness of this matter to him, so that when he commits it again next time, even if he is scolded, he will not be surprised and throw a tantrum.

(5) Pay attention to the child's psychological state. When children are too tired, hungry, or overstimulated, they are prone to anger and do things that they would not do even in a rage under normal circumstances. When they are in such an environment, parents should not blame them. They should try their best to find the reasons why they are angry and remove them (such as giving them food when they are hungry and clothes when they are cold), or give them a reasonable amount of rest. When they return to a normal and calm state, then use guidance to tell them what they did wrong.

(6) Children are naturally active, curious, and careless. However, many people cannot tolerate these characteristics of theirs. Children are just children. How can they distinguish between what is good and what is bad like adults? For example, if a child puts on a new piece of clothing, he might sit on the ground to play or eat fruit, making the new piece of clothing very dirty, and when he is scolded, he will throw a tantrum. The reason why the child made the clothes dirty is because the child does not know that making the clothes dirty is a bad behavior. As parents, you should use observation and teaching to deal with and enlighten their ignorance, and not always give unreasonable beatings.

(7) Children are most attentive to their surrounding environment. People who are easily angered can affect children, also making them easily angered. Next door to me, there is a family with only a mother and son. That mother scolds her son every day, so her son has also become naughty and easily angered.

(8) When a child is angry, do not give him what he wants. Many parents, in order to stop a child from throwing a tantrum, exhaust every means to satisfy the child's abnormal demands. In this way, although the child's anger stops, he will imitate this method whenever he wants something in the future. Wouldn't that become a habit! Many children's habits of throwing tantrums are formed in this way.

(9) When a child is angry, he likes to attract people's attention. Sometimes, his anger is just to elicit a reaction from adults, to let adults know that he is angry; perhaps he wants to test the extent of adults' reaction to his tantrums and get comfort. However, many adults fall for it. If they are strict, they will give him a heavy warning. Although he may sometimes be subdued as a result, it only increases his desire to test and have a second try. Sometimes, if he is not subdued, he will instead become even angrier. Weak parents will use things to stop his anger, which is even worse. The child thinks that throwing a tantrum will get him something unexpected, so how can he not frequently get angry? Therefore, as parents, when you feel that a child is angry for this reason, you should not only ignore him, but also tell him that this kind of behavior will not get him any results. He can try his best to throw a tantrum, letting him learn a lesson—that throwing a tantrum is useless—and he won't throw one casually next time!

The above methods for dealing with children's tantrums can only be achieved by parents with absolute determination. Many children throw tantrums for a long time, and the parents are afraid that the child will get too upset, so they deliberately break the rules and bribe them with things. This cultivates the child's bad habits. Some parents can make up their minds, but they give in to the child because of the grandparents. But, parents, ultimately, your child's future is important!

### Cooking: Iced Lian

— Zou Shangchang

During this hot summer, housewives often take their children to ice shops to eat iced lian, which is both costly and time-consuming, and even more inconvenient if there are many children. Now, I will introduce a way to make your own iced lian that saves money and time. If four or five people are eating, a small bucket is enough. We often see stalls selling egg roll iced lian on the side of the road; they use this kind of bucket to shake it out.

The ingredients are six eggs, one can of evaporated milk, a small bottle of flavoring, an appropriate amount of sugar, fifteen pounds of ice, and a small amount of salt.

First, break the eggs, separate the egg whites and yolks, and beat them into a foam. Then, add the evaporated milk, sugar, and flavoring, and mix well. If you like it sweet, add more sugar. Then, pour it into the iron bucket for shaking iced lian, and add cold water until it is one inch from being full (because it will become loose after shaking and fill the entire bucket). Place it in a wooden bucket, add ice outside, and put a little salt on top to lower its temperature. Once everything is ready, you can start shaking it. It takes about a quarter of an hour to take it out and eat, and the taste is extremely delicious, no less than what you buy. If your family has skim milk powder brought back from school by younger siblings, then you can use it. Take a teacup of milk powder, mix it with water, making sure there are no lumps, and then mix it with the eggs, evaporated milk, sugar, etc., and the taste will be even richer.

The total cost is less than half of what it would cost for four or five people to eat in a store, and the quantity is more than twice as much as in a store. It can truly be called inexpensive and of high quality. Wise housewives, instead of running to the store in the hot weather, why not make a bucket yourself?

### A Tip for Household Matters

— Li Ying

Recently, the weather has been extremely hot, and various insects and poisonous creatures often appear. The other day, I happened to visit a friend's house and saw that a centipede had been found inside the mosquito net. They were at a loss, and ended up clamping the centipede outside the net, tearing a large hole in it to take it down, which was extremely foolish.

If a poisonous creature is found inside the net, and it is inconvenient to take the net down, you can hold a basin filled with water up with your hand, placing it below the poisonous creature. Another person outside the net can strike the net with an object, causing the creature to fall into the basin. The creature cannot crawl out of the water in the basin. However, you must be agile to avoid it escaping and causing complications.

### On Adornment

— Mu Mei

Love of beauty is human nature. Within appropriate limits, I am not against ordinary people's adornment. Often, some people use "applying rouge and powder" to ridicule women. The old saying "women adorn themselves for those who appreciate them" has some slighting implications for women. In fact, I think that rather than being unkempt and disheveled, giving people an unpleasant feeling, it is better to lightly and appropriately adorn your hair, face, and clothes to give people a clean and beautiful impression. As for many women who specialize in heavy makeup and bizarre clothing to win the jealousy of other women and the favors of men, that is quite unnecessary.

The most important condition for adornment is to be suitable for your identity and pay attention to your age. Is it appropriate for a fifteen- or sixteen-year-old middle school student to hold books in her hand and wear high heels? Is it appropriate for a fifty- or sixty-year-old grandmother to perm her hair and apply lipstick? Those who are good at adornment will definitely match their hair, clothing, shoes, and socks to their identity and age. Then, when you are in public, you will definitely be able to give people a good impression that is appropriate, and you will never be given stares or whispered comments!

However, the general women of Shanghai are too fond of following trends blindly. As long as a cheongsam has a style that is popular outside, they will follow suit regardless of everything. At one time, a striped pattern was popular for clothing. It certainly flattered a slender figure, but the average short and plump woman also imitated it. After wearing it, the pattern of the clothing itself was certainly fashionable, but when worn on a short and plump body, it only made the person appear shorter and fatter, and almost swollen, with no sense of beauty at all! In recent years, many fashionable women like to wear leather shoes barefoot. A pair of tender, lotus root-like feet without scars, plus a pair of snow-white leather shoes, certainly feels clean and simple. However, not every woman's feet are exactly the same. Once, on the road, I saw an old woman who was nearly fifty years old, with her hair permed into waves, the sleeves of her cheongsam cut short to the shoulders, and a long-strapped leather bag hanging on her shoulder. Her face was painted red and white, but it could not hide the traces of wrinkles. When I lowered my head to look, it was even more unbearable. She was actually wearing a pair of white deerskin hollow shoes barefoot. The unnatural state of walking with a twist and pinch, heaven knows, this was clearly a pair of feet that had been rebuilt! What was the point of that? She felt uncomfortable herself and there was no beauty to speak of, and she was even ridiculed and talked about behind her back. Such blind imitation of adornment is truly wanting to increase its beauty but only adding to its ugliness!

Love of beauty is not a disgrace for women, but what should be paid attention to is not to blindly follow fashion and forget one's own identity and age.

### On the Issue of Popularizing Art

— Shi Liangfu

The issue of "popularizing art" was hotly debated during the war. Proponents of "popularization" constantly emphasized that "art should be for the masses," "art cannot be isolated from the masses," and "works that are not accepted by the masses will lose their value." These statements cannot be denied by us. However, in fact, up to now, this issue is still an issue. Artists say so, write so, but are their works all liked by the masses? I dare say that the more accomplished the writer, the more impassable this road is at present! Take woodcut art as an example. From the beginning, it touted realism and claimed to be popular art. In the free areas during the war, due to the difficulty of etching metal plates, it also gained some appreciation from people. However, are those who appreciate woodcuts some of the toiling masses of the lower and middle classes? This is a big question mark. I remember that we held several national woodcut exhibitions in Anhui Province, and the audience cannot be said to be small! The strangest thing is that there were no farmers (or businessmen) among the audience. Even if there were one or two who joined in the fun, they were not as interested as when they watched calendar posters and Fu Qi's comic books. Is it that the content and form of the works are not good enough? No! Almost nine out of ten of the works we exhibited were the writer's proud masterpieces, and they had been selected several times before the exhibition, so they cannot be said to be substandard. Why does this phenomenon occur? This shows that, apart from catering to the masses, advocating the popularization of art in the current stage of Chinese society is a dead end, because the deeper the mastery of the work, the more incomprehensible it is to those with insufficient knowledge! Then, is a writer willing to have his skills and content not seek further progress, but just stop at the stage of catering to the vulgar tastes of the masses and be satisfied? I think that apart from its performance techniques having no way to improve and other intentions, this will absolutely not happen. These words, I think, do not negate the truth that art should be popularized. The real way to popularize art is not to lower its value to cater to the masses, but to first improve the masses' ability to appreciate it, which is a legitimate path.

Therefore, we come to a conclusion: if the living standards of the masses are not improved, then they will not be able to enjoy higher education. The lower the level of education, the lower the ability to appreciate. Therefore, the focus of the problem is still on the two words "people's livelihood." It is useless to just shout for the popularization of art.

### Bumping

— Zhang Baihuai

We are about to leave a place that will be so deeply etched in our memories in the future, under the old, lush trees. Enthusiastic hands are waving, a deep and earnest farewell song is being sung, and the small triangular red flag inserted on the front of the car begins to flutter in the bright sunlight. Our bodies are also vibrating slightly. The stuffy carriage is like a building with open windows, quickly flowing through a layer of mountain joy….

People are being carried forward to a new memory. It is said that the destination was once an extremely remote border town. Today, we imagine what kind of long street that border town has, a street that laughs out loud from lonely dreams, with groups of elementary school students chasing after the soldiers, receiving candies, biscuits, and other toys and gifts….

The earth has several strong jolts. This road is so hard to flatten! The vibrating sound in my ears is so loud that I feel dizzy. The comrades who are talking seem to be just those three or four. I accidentally open my eyes, which I don't know when I closed. Uh oh, one of the comrades vomited.

People wipe it with their hands, and some take out handkerchiefs with the name of the service team's young lady embroidered on them—or perhaps with the name of their dearest person embroidered on them.

"Hey, make some room!" Someone shouted at the three companions on the roof of the car.

"Make some room, there's no wind in here!"

That's a gap above the driver's seat, the only happiness of the people sitting in the carriage, their hope lies on it. Look how respectful those three comrades are of other people's opinions, they quickly lean to both sides, willing to sit in such a small position. They won't lose their balance when the car goes downhill, will they?

When our car stopped at a desolate small shop, the sky was covered with clouds and a drizzle fell. What a pleasant way the comrades spread out the supplies for the journey. That deserted small restaurant and tea shop had happy, light-hearted conversations and laughter. "Hey, what's wrong, can't you bear a little hardship?" Someone laughed at the vomiting weakling. They spat a mouthful of saliva, and although they were hungry, they still refused the temptation of food.

The wheels were turning and twisting on the mud and stones, and it was really a big road. That meant, they calculated, they could arrive at the city before dusk.

Anti-Japanese songs, the people in the car were all silent, overcome by fatigue and sleep, or perhaps someone was quietly thinking about something. Alas, I seemed to hear someone sigh. This car was sending him to such a remote place, and these comrades would mostly see the classmates and professors who had once encouraged them to join the war, and even their proud, sociable girlfriends, in the cities they passed through….

Well, they should all be thinking about how to brag about that new life, that life so tense that there was no time to write letters! Why isn't it worth bragging about? "Look," they can say righteously, "the color of my skin explains everything."

But how many bumps! Our car suddenly broke down! The front wheel came off the axle, and the car tilted forward for dozens of steps, leaving a deep mark on the road. The driver, sticking out his tongue, said: If it had been downhill, this would have been the end!

So, is there still a need to worry in vain? Our driver is a skilled technician. Without hesitation, they crawled under the car to inspect it, tapping and turning, and started to repair it.

On the top of the mountain peak, we saw orange-yellow rays of light, the setting sun reddening half the sky, crystal-clear evening clouds, white clouds dancing leisurely.

The comrades gathered together and sang.

In the dim light, the car now has two large eyes wide open. The driver even deliberately honked the horn, causing a ripple in the mountains. Oh, it's time to drive, people now need a grand dinner so much.

The night city, rested our breathing. Bed bugs and mosquitoes, sucking our tired dreams. The journey is still very far.

The next day, we moved the luggage to the car again. I became one of the three passengers on the green-painted roof of the car. I was taught to use a belt to strap my shoulders and knew that it wasn't dangerous. My two companions were kind, they told me that facing the wind, I wouldn't get dizzy, but when passing by the branches of trees on the side of the road, I had to be careful to lower my head, and beware of my glasses….

Indeed, compared to being inside, it was as different as shackles and freedom. Sitting here, what you see is the blue of the sky, the magnificence of the sun, the winding highway, and the green of the surrounding fields, the bridges, the village houses, and the terraced fields like large stone steps…. It allows people to look around and appreciate the strangeness of nature even while bumping along. My comrades and I also talked about the past and future dreams, and jointly expressed a firm belief.

We were always paying attention, so as not to let a comrade inside get angry because of stuffiness. We sat sideways, "Cool wind, come in!" one, we even shouted like this.

After passing through a city, and then another city… Although these cities are red and green, we think that one day our young new team will enter the crisscrossing paved roads, with tanks and motorcycles as the vanguard, and countless people and young women will throw flowers at us, and we will truly be proud and happy!

We have already traveled seven hundred kilometers. On the last day, our car climbed over a high mountain ridge, and when it was only a short distance from a border town in that basin, the overcast wind finally surged, and the car drove the last ten kilometers in the wind and rain. For the sake of a kind of heart's persistence, we didn't avoid the crowded carriage because our clothes were wet. Taking off our shoes and socks and rolling up our sleeves, we supported ourselves, smiling in the wind and rain. In the howling rain and thunder, and the splashing water under the wheels, we had a strange, tense pleasure in our hearts, as if we were engaged in a battle.

Seeing the newly built training field outside the suburbs, we had arrived, we cheered, and then the song followed the car into the city gate. In the dusk, when we jumped out of the car: some people were thinking: the border mountain city, what a long street, one day a great procession will wind its way from here like a dragon to the coast thousands of miles away….

### Laying the Foundation for True Democracy, Embarking on the Stage of Constitutional Practice, Seeking Welfare for More Than Four Million Citizens

— Our Reporter, Zhang Yinhuai

"August 13th" is a significant turning point in Shanghai's history. Nine years ago today, the fury of resistance spread throughout Shanghai with the flames of war. Nine years later today, Shanghai's first truly representative body of public opinion is declared established.

The brilliant torch of constitutionalism shines the first light of dawn before the eyes of four and a half million citizens.

Review of Glorious Pre-War History, Regular Review of General Estimates and Budgets

However, it must be said that Shanghai's having representatives of public opinion did not begin today. Before the war, the city had already established a Provisional Municipal Council, with councilors such as Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Xu Yongzuo, and Wang Boqi. Among them were the late Yu Qiaqing, Wang Yiting, Xu Xinliu, General Manager of Zhejiang Industrial Bank who was shot down by Japanese寇 in the southwestern sky, and Liu Zhanen, President of Shanghai University who was shot and killed by Japanese secret agents in Shanghai. There were also Wu Yunqi, Wen Lanting, and others who are now problematic figures. They regularly held meetings to pass the general estimate of the previous year, discuss the city's financial budget, or hold tea parties to entertain some Chinese and foreign political and diplomatic dignitaries.

During the eight years of bloody war, loyal and steadfast representatives of public opinion naturally withdrew with the National Army to the rear, and Shanghai became an isolated island, a demonic realm without light. Under the bayonets of the enemy, they naturally had their own system. Puppets like Xu Jianping and Jian Jianwu appeared one after another—but this did not diminish the inherent brilliance of Shanghai's municipal administration, which remained bright in the hearts of four and a half million citizens, but rather made them recognize the true nature of those puppets.

Mayor Wu as Chairman of the Assembly

Restoring the Citizens' Representation, the Provisional Council Should Be Established Soon

Victory purged these jumping clowns. The citizens of Shanghai wanted to restore their own representative body. Therefore, in February of the 35th year, the Municipal Government, following the orders of the Examination and Executive Yuan, actively prepared for the public office candidate vetting and then held elections for representatives of people's organizations at all levels. The entire city first conducted a census, reorganized the baojia system, and on March 28th, the Provisional Municipal Council was established.

The Provisional Municipal Council was a transitional body before the formal election of councilors by the citizens under objective environmental constraints. Although the councilors were appointed by the government, the selected candidates included those from the financial, industrial, commercial, news, educational, and cultural sectors, all of whom were highly respected choices of the time. The number was one hundred and fifty, with Xu Jiqing as the speaker and Xi Yushu as the vice speaker. Since the first meeting on the 30th, during the two-week session, various agencies reported daily, and there were enthusiastic inquiries from the provisional councilors. The assembly closed on April 10th and issued a declaration on the 11th.

After the Provisional Municipal Council adjourned, a resident committee was established. The committee was an advisor and also a supervisor of municipal administration. It had fulfilled its greatest responsibilities in areas such as epidemic prevention and security.

Citizens Elect Municipal Councilors, All Parties Enthusiastically Participate in the Election

In early April, the Municipal Government began preparing for the popular election of municipal councilors. The city was divided into 31 districts, as well as five categories: chambers of commerce, trade unions, agricultural associations, educational associations, and free professional groups, each proceeding separately. The city had more than 2.5 million voters, preparing to elect their representatives from over a thousand candidates. Many candidates also gave campaign speeches, broadcasts, or other forms of publicity in advance, and the atmosphere was unprecedentedly enthusiastic. Huang Hua and Wang Zhuyi, advisors to the Municipal Government, also specifically requested to resign from the mayor in order to participate in the election, which also shows the enthusiasm of all parties to participate in the election.

Citizens of Each District Vote Separately, All Municipal Councilors Elected

April 28th was the day of the general election. From morning to dusk, voters voted separately. Mayor Qian Qian also cast his vote at around 9:00 am. Although some minor unfortunate events occurred in the meantime, such as quarrels in the Hongqiao District, the destruction of the Jade Buddha Temple in the Putuo District, and vote rigging leading to mutual fighting in the Yulin District, the first batch of 181 municipal councilors was elected after all.

Among these 181 municipal councilors, Yao Mulian, the elected representative of the Penglai District, was the oldest, at 68 years old. Tian Yiting of the Yulin District and Jia Dechao of the Yangjing District were the youngest, both at 28 years old. There were only six female councilors (not including alternates). One has passed away, Weng Guang of the 12th District.

Now, the inaugural meeting of the Municipal Council has been set for 9:00 am today at the former German Primary School on Daxi Road, laying a new cornerstone for Shanghai's democratized municipal administration. Constitutionalism has embarked on the stage of practice. It is hoped that the 181 councilors will make good use of the power entrusted to them by the voters of Shanghai, lay a solid foundation for the constitutional movement, serve as a great model for the expression of public opinion nationwide, and seek welfare for four and a half million citizens.

The Municipal Council under the jurisdiction of the Yuan shall have one secretary-general; the Municipal Council under the jurisdiction of the province shall have one secretary-in-charge and one or two secretaries; and three to nine clerks, all of whom shall be selected and appointed by the speaker. If necessary, personnel may be transferred from the Municipal Government.

### Murmuring Thunder

— Yang Lianyuan

In the sweltering air, rumbling sounds – is it murmuring thunder?

Let me tell you, two hours ago, I returned from a theater after the show ended. At that time, the sky was covered with dark clouds. I thought, how annoyed the heavens must be! But I carried back with me the unclear atmosphere from the stage, my heart filled with sighs for the joys and sorrows, the separations and reunions of those characters.

So, have I been infected with a slight, faint melancholy? Perhaps I have already begun to ponder something else. Alas, it's hard to say.

Now, I want to ask you to explore in your dust-covered memories, to trace back to thousands of years ago. Under the shade of paulownia trees, by the painted galleries, the sounds of vendors selling iced treats couldn't reach inside. At that time, the people in the house were busy with worldly affairs. Then, you, a child whose life hadn't yet blossomed, and I, a young boy. Now, let's adopt the tone of adults and say we were innocent playmates. Do you agree? Thinking back, we might both smile bashfully. Under the paulownia trees, we read together, a beautiful book filled with too many lessons: "Dream of the Red Chamber."

To be more precise, we were sharing the same dream.

It's truly a distant memory, but today's murmuring thunder has unearthed too many of my cherished recollections.

Today, I came back from seeing the play called "Dream of the Red Chamber," also known as "Murmuring Thunder." Therefore, I thought I should write something down, to speak! To speak of my joy, to speak of my resentment.

When we were young, we both shared the same dream: we had the same background, the same education. Speaking of it today, perhaps we would both smile wryly. Years have passed, seeming like lifetimes. It turned out that before our childish dreams had even awakened, we had already parted ways.

Why did we separate? Today, recalling it only adds to the pain. But the pain has followed me closely since watching the performance of "Dream of the Red Chamber," and it struck the chords of my sorrowful heart.

Bao Yu in the play said, "My voice is like murmuring thunder, unable to cry out, suppressed by thousands of years of clouds." So, have our voices also been suppressed by these years of clouds?

I know that in these years, you have lived a life of simple, pure sustenance. The storms outside cannot touch you. How has this life affected you? Are you clear about it now?

In the past few years, I had to bear the burden of the spirit given by the times, and also worry about the gradual extinguishing of the flames of my own emotions. That's how it was for me.

May I ask, how is it for you?

My voice is hoarse, but I refuse to be "resigned" to fate.

It's midnight now, what a poet would call a midsummer night. A cool breeze blows in through the window, driving away the summer heat, and I finally enjoy a quiet night.

But the murmuring thunder is still rumbling, and the sound is unsettling.

Tell me! How long must we endure?

### An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

—If this romance has even a shred of value, the author reverently dedicates it to the fighters who sacrificed themselves in the eight years of war, and to their families.

·Prologue·

I apologize, but the word "prologue" is somewhat old-fashioned, pathetically so, but it's quite fitting, so I'll use it once. Please forgive me, reader—

In the thirty-eight thousand nine hundred and thirty-first small battle, there was such an incident. I can't remember which one it was (please note, the military has records). This war of resistance, besides the thirty-eight thousand nine hundred and thirty-one small battles, also had one thousand one hundred and seventeen important battles, and twenty-two tearful and soul-stirring rallies. Anyway, in these thirty-eight thousand and nine hundred plus small battles, there was such an incident.

Even though it was a small battle, the struggle between the enemy and us was quite fierce. Within twenty-four hours, [missing text], not losing much ground. They just signed a hand [missing text], [missing text] of De Wen [missing text] the battle [missing text] held on, not letting [missing text] for a moment. Our main firepower consisted of only two [missing text] gun nests, deployed [missing text], one on the left, one on the right, about ten yards apart, launching [missing text] on the [missing text] bridge on the [missing text] north of the Huai River.

The enemy had plenty of firearms: rifles, grenade launchers, small mortars, and so on. On average, one of our machine gun nests was destroyed every two hours because there wasn't a very strong barrier. Fortunately, as soon as one was destroyed, another was replenished. They stubbornly held on for a whole hour.

The stretcher team was the only way to rescue the wounded here, but there weren't enough people. So the lightly wounded had to carry the heavily wounded to the temporary hospital in the rear. The routine washing, applying medicine, bandaging, or surgery were all done. Those who couldn't be saved were, of course, carried out to be buried. Those who could be saved were considered to have received good care. The only exceptional symptom was quite troublesome because there were too many casualties and there were no blood transfusion supplies here, so they had to lie there half-dead, relying on fate. The high fever caused them to groan, mutter, and shout wildly.

The night nurse was half sympathetic and half a little impatient. She saw the lightly wounded comrade guarding there, unwilling to leave. "Why didn't you get him here faster? Did you hit him?" The nurse was somewhat indignant.

"Reporting, squad leader, it wasn't on purpose, he just wouldn't leave." The Hunan accent was mixed with some out-of-province tones.

"Why?" The nurse was a little angry.

"Who knows… the devils are all gone, but he's still reluctant to let go." He sighed softly.

"What about the other brothers?" The nurse seemed to regain her sympathy.

Ten died, eight and a half! "The wounded felt miserable." If the squad leader doesn't believe my report, you can just go and see tomorrow, there are two gun nests, the mud underground is all red, turned into two pools of blood!

"What!" The nurse probably sensed the blood in those two mud pits, and her eyebrows furrowed immediately, as if she wanted to beat something out of her heart.

"This guy," the wounded soldier pointed to the one lying on the bed suffering from excessive blood loss, "his legs, ribs, shoulders, and head are all wounded by shrapnel… a shell exploded two or three meters to our right… he was bleeding all the way, a person only has two liters of blood in total, how can it not run out?"

The one lying on the bed, at this moment, his hands, feet, and whole body convulsed and trembled uncontrollably. His hoarse voice, mixed with phlegm, was weak and unintelligible, as if he was saying, "Mom… damn it… I just won't let you… come over!"

### Silence

— Shao Fu

Today is August 13th, marking exactly ten years since that bloody historical drama of the Battle of Shanghai during the War of Resistance against Japan.

Ten years, like a dream. Ten years, although not a short time (how many decades does one have in life, really!), but everything at that time seems very clear, as if it were right before my eyes. Taking the nation as an account book, we can say that we have all contributed our capital in these ten years, or we can say that we have not fulfilled our full responsibilities.

Let us think, what kind of atmosphere permeated Shanghai ten years ago today, what kind of emotions did people have; what kind of atmosphere and emotions are there ten years later today?

Today, we are again facing a most serious juncture, the severity of which even exceeds that of ten years ago today, because foreign aggression can destroy a country, but internal strife can destroy it even more so. On the one hand, we remember the sacrifices and bloodshed of countless heroic soldiers; on the other hand, we truly feel fearful and horrified about the days ahead.

Truly, there are thousands of words, and I don't know where to begin.

### Not Empty Rhetoric – A Few Words for "August 13th"—

— You Fu

"August 13th" is a sorrowful day in Chinese history, and also a happy day.

Nine years ago, it freed China from the shackles of being a semi-colonial state and issued the call of the Chinese nation to resist.

Coincidentally, on this day one year ago, the war finally ended in victory. It can also be said that "August 13th" symbolizes China's light and happiness.

Last year today, on every street in Chongqing, such as Guofu Road, Lianglukou, Fuzichi, Jingshengbaolei, Xiaoshizi, Minquan Road, Minzu Road, Zhongyi Road, and Zhonger Road, especially in front of the Broadcasting Building, there was an endless stream of people, listening to the good news of victory with smiling faces. That kind of jubilant mood expressed the infinite happiness that victory bestowed upon everyone, making everyone forget the suffering of the past eight years.

On the street, every passerby, upon seeing someone, would invariably ask, "When are you going home?" around "August 13th." In the days before and after, many people were controlled by the god of victory all day long, forgetting themselves, and even staying up all night.

On the veranda of the Broadcasting Building, two large speakers were placed, continuously broadcasting the good news of Japan's surrender to all of Chongqing. As a result, many people sat and stood on both sides of the stone steps of the Broadcasting Building all night long, listening to that enthusiastic report.

In Chengdu, groups of young men and women walked shoulder to shoulder on Chunxi Road. They nodded and smiled at each other, without distinguishing between people from Jiangsu and people from Sichuan, speaking intimately with an unprecedented harmony, and jointly strode along that lively street, encouraging each other with joy.

Other places such as Xi'an, Lanzhou, Kunming, and Guiyang also celebrated as jubilantly as Chongqing and Chengdu.

At that time, we imagined that the future of our motherland was immeasurably bright.

In the past year, the various things that have been manifested after victory have been heartbreaking!

There are political parties in the motherland who are enemies of the people, refugees from the Soviet Union are scattered everywhere, transportation cannot be restored, social order cannot be maintained, and corruption and malfeasance continue to occur, making it impossible for people to live and work in peace. Who would have foreseen this series of misfortunes a year ago!

Today is the first "August 13th" after victory. The work of demobilization and national reconstruction has been underway for a year, but everything is empty, everything is chaotic. In order to commemorate this sacred day—"August 13th"—we fervently hope that no one will be allowed to create civil war and undermine peaceful national reconstruction on the land of our motherland again. We no longer want to smell the gunpowder, and, moreover, all those who have escaped the law after collaborating with the enemy must be thoroughly and strictly dealt with! The orphans of all the soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the country must be effectively guaranteed! We cannot bear everyone feeling empty because of victory, and forgetting the historical day "August 13th"!

Everyone can perform magic tricks, but each has different skills. There are too many people in our country, both in and out of government, who can perform magic tricks. The higher the rank, the better the magic trick; there are also wealthy merchants who are masters of magic tricks.

How can the above be explained? Although magic tricks are ever-changing, to summarize it, it is nothing more than the two words "have" and "not have"; it is either "from nothing to something" or "from something to nothing."

Before high-ranking officials take the stage, their hands are empty. But once they get promoted, their value increases tenfold. As a result, they have foreign houses, cars, beautiful wives and concubines, everything they could want. Especially in insurance, there are all sorts of colours, dazzling the poor. Isn't this a magic trick of "from nothing to something"?

If corruption causes trouble, people report it, and the court investigates, as long as the position is prominent, officials will protect each other. The result is "no evidence found." This is a type of "from something to nothing" magic trick.

If all parties cannot understand this case and insist on "patting a fly on the tiger's head"; even the Control Yuan can't stand it and sends someone to investigate; if there is evidence, they will file an impeachment; then there are two final methods of playing the emergency card: one is fire, and the other is theft. This can turn what is there into nothing, a complete muddle. This is also a grand "from something to nothing" magic trick, but it is not easily performed unless it is the final act of the show.

Someone asked: "Is there any factual basis for fire and theft?" The author replied: "Of course, there is a factual basis. Aren't warehouses for enemy and puppet materials taken over in various places often catching fire? Weren't some of the archives of the former Shanghai Municipal Council suddenly stolen?" Ultimately, the result is one sentence: "Magic tricks are never a good phenomenon for a country"?

### A Smile

— Ge Chunliang

Mr. Gilbert from Chicago and Mr. Li Bao from Qihai met on the beach where they were escaping the summer heat and became very close friends after two weeks. When they were preparing to go back, Li Bao insisted on inviting Gilbert to visit Qihai with him before returning to Chicago. So, Gilbert had a lot of fun at Li Bao's house and ate very well. After a few days, on Monday morning, Gilbert found a forty-dollar bill on his breakfast plate. "That's really absurd, you insisted on inviting me to stay for a week, how would I have come if you hadn't invited me, and now you want to charge me, there's no reason for that."

"Of course, I want money," Li Bao said, "otherwise why would I have invited you?"

The argument became more and more intense. Finally, Li Bao said, "I'll tell you what, let's go to the Jewish judge and let him judge this matter!" Gilbert finally obeyed. So they went to the local Jewish judge together and told him the complete details of the case. He listened to the matter very carefully and in detail, and then said, "Gilbert should pay the forty dollars." The Chicagoan was extremely angry, but because he had promised to let the judge decide, he had to give the forty dollars to Li Bao when he came out.

"Who wants your money? I never dreamed of taking your money!" Li Bao said.

"What do you mean?" The friend was confused.

"I've already taken you to see all the famous historical sites in Qihai," Li Bao said. "Now I'm just letting you see what a famous rascal the Jewish judge in Qihai is!"

### "August 13th – Skip a Meal!"

— Xin Fang

"August 13th," this anniversary will forever be the greatest and most brilliant page left by the people of Shanghai in the history of China, and even in the history of the world.

Now that the War of Resistance has been won, China has embarked on a more difficult path. How to clean up the post-war ruins? How to start our construction work? The people of Shanghai should use the spirit of "August 13th" to create more glorious achievements for the new China of the future, but looking back at the situation in Shanghai today, I sincerely feel heartache; the people of Shanghai seem to have forgotten "August 13th," and also forgotten their own responsibilities to the motherland; "China is starving, Shanghai is dancing" isn't this the most scathing criticism of the people of Shanghai?

China's future must be bright, and the people of Shanghai will certainly not forget "August 13th." When commemorating "August 13th" this year, I hope that the people of Shanghai will launch a "skip a meal" movement. The homophony of "August 13th" and "skip a meal" is the same, but the greatest significance is still to hope that the general public in Shanghai can save some personal consumption. We don't have to go hungry for a meal, but at least every capable Shanghainese should donate the cost of one meal, then, many small contributions will make a great whole, and there will be a lot of work to do!

"August 13th" is a glorious day, but the glory of "August 13th" needs the people of Shanghai to take responsibility for maintaining it themselves.

### A Few Words to Fathers (Continued)

— Zhou Shang

2. Moral Cultivation—"When you have the capacity, then study literature." Our country has valued morality since ancient times. Now, morality is "on leave," and people's hearts are sinking. Fathers must put in extra effort in their children's character and behaviour, especially to supplement the school's training. The family is the only place for moral cultivation, and family education is the only place for moral cultivation. Family education is moral education. Etiquette is solemn, represented by the father, hence the saying "strict father." Music is harmonious, represented by the mother, hence the saying "kind mother." The combination is very reasonable. Children should feel a sense of awe and respect when they see their father, but you must not make them feel afraid. Fear can lead to lying and deception and other bad behaviours. The most important thing is to lead by example, to adhere to moral standards in conduct, position, words, dealings with people, opponents, and matters. You must absolutely and unconditionally believe in your beloved wife and in the Three Principles of the People for saving the country. This should be the case whether your children are present or not, and should be consistent throughout, so that you can have a subtle influence on them. You must clearly distinguish between righteousness and profit, and especially change your attitude towards money. Bacon said, "Money is a good servant, but a most dangerous mistress." You must abandon the worship of money. "It is a shame to be rich and honoured when the state is without the Way." This sentence should be explained in detail to the younger generation.

3. Academic Cultivation—It seems that our country's tradition places the responsibility of teaching on the father, hence the appearance of the Three Character Classic: "To nourish without teaching is the father's fault." If someone becomes famous through their mother's teaching, they are particularly praised, and the mother is in the limelight. After the Industrial Revolution, modern cities formed, and fathers let go of the matter of teaching their children and handed it all over to schools. Today, many fathers cannot afford to send their children to school, and they still need the generosity of people in society to help. In fact, there are still large numbers of children who can only sigh at the sight of schools. And school education has too many shortcomings. "Studying books to death, reading dead books, reading books to death," is the biggest problem. Fathers should often contact schools to promote active education, inspire children's creativity, and liberate their children's minds, hands, mouths, and time and space, so as to engage in creative work. In democratic life, learn democracy, teach children to understand how to realize the Three Principles of the People, that is, to practice democracy and socialism. Only parents know their children's personalities best, and perhaps fathers know them most clearly. The saying "No one knows a child like their father" is correct. You should teach them knowledge that adapts to society based on their personality, so as to match their future occupation. Chinese classics must be read, and foreign science must be caught up with. In elementary school, there is no need to stuff their minds like fish in a sand pond, leaving no room for gaps. Give them more opportunities for free activities. By the time they reach middle school, they must receive rigid and strict education.

4. Marriage Guidance—Marriage is not only a lifelong event for men and women, but also a lifelong event for the next generation, and even more so for the nation. The Doctrine of the Mean states: "The Way of Heaven and Earth begins with the relationship between husband and wife," affirming the importance of marriage. Marriage guidance is based on sex education. Many teachers have not yet married themselves, how can they take on this responsibility? Schools have many students, making it difficult to provide individual guidance. Therefore, the most suitable teachers for sex education are still parents, and the most suitable environment is the family. Sex education in the West has been renamed "Social Hygiene," which contains the biological basis of the race and has the effects of heredity and eugenics. In the past, our country paid attention to "matching social status" in marriage. Perhaps this is what it meant. Our country also advocates "men marrying at thirty and women marrying at twenty," which is even more reasonable from a scientific point of view. Early marriage is national suicide, and it has already harmed us. Sex education should start from a young age. If it comes suddenly in adolescence, it often causes emotional reactions, which may be worse than not teaching at all. The teaching should not be too much or too little, but honest and simple. This requires preparation, cultivation, and the ability to adapt to circumstances and evoke emotions based on the scene. "Sex" is like eating and dressing, there's nothing sneaky about it. Russell said it well: "To break down obscenity, first break down the mystery." I am an advocate of monogamy and "exclusive love." Psychologically, exclusive love can be learned as a habit. I always tell my eight children: "Before marriage, talk more about reason and less about love; after marriage, talk more about love and less about reason." This way, the tragedy of divorce can be reduced in the world. The psychology of love: in childhood it is self-love. In elementary school it is "same-sex love." At this time, there is often animosity between boys and girls. When they enter junior high school, they begin "opposite-sex love." Many abnormalities in love are mostly caused in childhood, such as spanking.

"The Way of the Father" is the backbone of Father's Day. If Father's Day ignores the Way of the Father, then what remains is only superficial activities, a lively event that does not take root. For the sake of family hatred, for the sake of national vengeance, for the sake of the construction of the entire nation, we must advocate "The Way of the Father."
