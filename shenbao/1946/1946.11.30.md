Yu Bin and Wu Tiecheng will serve as chairpersons for the morning and afternoon sessions, respectively.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 29th] The National Assembly Presidium held its eighth meeting at 6:00 PM on the 29th, presided over by Yu Bin. The following matters were decided: (1) Regarding the methods for group review of the draft constitution of the Republic of China, it was decided in principle to establish eight review committees. For the first seven committees, representatives can freely choose to join one or two groups. The eighth group is a comprehensive review committee. Fifteen people will be designated by the presidium from the conveners of the first seven committees, and one person will be nominated by each electoral unit. (2) Each assembly meeting is planned to be held for half a day. Both of the above items will be submitted to the assembly for discussion.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 29th] At 3:00 PM on the 29th, the National Assembly continued its fourth meeting. 1,147 representatives were present. Left Shunsheng chaired the meeting, and representatives continued to express their opinions freely. The speakers in order were Liu Wendao, Wang Youqiao, Bao Deming, He Foqing, Ding Ren, Jiang Gongliang, Peng Gechen, Zhu Huiqing, Liu Guanxun, Kong Geng, Kang Zhaogeng, Zhao Shu, Liu Zongping, Zhao Chunxiao, Yin Shuxian, Huang Shaomei, etc. Each expressed their opinions on the draft constitution with great enthusiasm. Many more continued to request to speak. At 6:00 PM, the chairman announced the adjournment. The fifth meeting will be held all day on the 30th, continuing with representatives expressing their opinions on the draft constitution. The following is a summary of the representatives' speeches: Liu Wendao's opinions: (1) In Chapter 1, Article 2, "The sovereignty of the Republic of China belongs to the entire people," the term "people" should be changed to "nationals." (2) The powers of the Legislative Yuan are very large, as stated in Article 58. If the Legislative Yuan continues to maintain its original resolution during reconsideration, it will cause too much difficulty for the President of the Executive Yuan. (3) If a dispute arises between the Legislative Yuan and the Executive Yuan, the President can convene a temporary meeting to discuss a resolution. Bao Deming's opinions on the draft constitution are (1) suitable for the national conditions, (2) suitable for the needs of the people, (3) considering the evolution after the implementation of the constitution, and (4) in line with the spirit of the founding of the nation. She has the following opinions on women's issues: (1) The National Assembly charter should stipulate that women representatives account for 20% of the total number of representatives. (2) The election charter should stipulate that women account for 20% of the number of members in the various levels of parliament, the Control Yuan, and the Legislative Yuan. (3) The chapter on basic national policies should stipulate a clause on equal employment for women. (4) Women should participate in the Judicial Yuan, the Examination Yuan, and the Executive Yuan. He Foqing's opinions: (1) The National Assembly charter is too far from the spirit of the Prime Minister's legacy. (2) A reserve president should be added to the presidency charter in addition to the vice president. Jiang Gongliang's opinions: (1) China's territory should be explicitly listed in the constitution. (2) Reducing the size of provinces will facilitate the connection between provinces and counties. Peng Gechen's opinions: (1) Article 4 should add the sentence "after being passed by the National Assembly, it will be implemented." (2) The clauses listed in Article 112 are related to the development of provincial administration and should be noted. Zhu Huiqing's opinions: (1) Chapter 3, the National Assembly charter, was revised in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, but the principles of the original draft have not been changed. Therefore, it forms an indirectly elected assembly, rather than a national assembly exercising the four powers, which is contrary to the Prime Minister's legacy and the outline of national construction. (2) The National Assembly should focus on occupational elections. Liu Guanxun's opinions: A constitution that is suitable for China's national conditions and meets the current needs is needed. Therefore, it should be carefully formulated and not simply copied from others, resulting in an incomplete constitution. First, a proposal review committee should be formed, and representatives should submit opinions on the constitution, which will be reviewed by the committee and then discussed by chapter. Kong Geng's opinions: In view of the Youth Party representative Yu Jiaju's statement that the constitution should be discussed with an open mind, it is believed that it must be properly discussed. First, each unit should elect representatives to form a draft constitution review committee, propose key points, then conduct group reviews, and then proceed with discussions to formulate a constitution that is suitable for the trends of the times. Chen Shaoxian believes that the Legislative Yuan has too much power, and its governing power should be restricted. Liu Zongping's opinions: (1) It is hoped that a clause guaranteeing the democratic autonomy of the frontier regions can be added to the general principles chapter. (2) The provincial and county system should be changed to a local system, and the "league" should be defined as equal to "province," and "banner" equal to "county" in the local system. Yin Shuxian said that the draft constitution has three advantages: (1) It establishes the status of each party. (2) Broad freedom of the people is guaranteed. (3) The Legislative Yuan becomes a political power institution, but Article 4, the territory of the Republic of China, should be listed.

### Majority of Representatives Oppose the Political Consultative Conference's Draft Constitution; Representatives Who Have Not Been Sworn in Will Take the Oath Today

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 29th] The National Assembly held its fourth meeting on the 29th and began a broad discussion on the draft constitution. At 9:40 AM, Secretary-General Hong reported that 1,627 people had registered, and 1,433 were present, which was sufficient for a quorum. Chairman Zuo Shunsheng then led the meeting to begin with formalities. First, the minutes of the third meeting were reported, followed by Secretary-General Hong reporting on congratulatory messages and letters of leave from representatives (omitted). Chairman Zuo reported on the presidium's decisions: (1) In accordance with Article 5 of the Rules of Procedure, the seats of the Assembly are determined by the presidium. After the fifth meeting of the presidium, the seats were divided according to the electoral units of the representatives and arranged by drawing lots. The seating arrangement for the representatives of each unit was based on the order of the list published by the National Government. The seating arrangements for each representative at the meeting were then determined separately through drawing lots at the sixth meeting of the presidium. (2) In accordance with Article 9 of the National Assembly Organization Law and Article 2 of the General Rules for the Organization of Various Review Committees, a representative qualification review committee was organized. The members and convener were nominated by the presidium. After Zuo's report, representative Xue Dubi was selected and presented a document stating that his father, Xue Shixuan, was too old and requested that he be removed from the list of members of the Representative Qualification Review Committee and replaced with another person. At 9:50 AM, Chairman Zuo announced that representatives should express their opinions on the draft constitution broadly, but no conclusions should be drawn. Instead, various opinions should be sent to the review sub-committees for reference. The discussion then began in the order of requests to speak on the 28th. Secretary-General Hong first read the written opinion of Zhu Jingnong, a representative of the liberal professions, suggesting that representatives raise major issues for discussion in the Assembly, while leaving minor issues to the review sub-committees to save time. Next, Chen Jixian, a representative of the Henan professions, raised two points. The first was that "the American-style government of the people, by the people, for the people in Article 1 of the draft constitution amendment is different from Dr. Sun Yat-sen's proposal, please pay attention to this." The second was that "the oath of representatives is extremely important. Representatives who have not been sworn in should first complete the procedures before discussing the constitution." After Chen's second point was raised, the atmosphere at the meeting suddenly became tense. The attendees rejected the presidium's decision to sign the oath separately and insisted that the oath-taking ceremony be conducted publicly. Some representatives then raised that the qualifications of representatives had not yet been reviewed, and the constitution could not be discussed. The number of people and candidates for the organization of the Representative Qualification Review Committee should be decided by the Assembly in accordance with the law. Zhang Lisheng, who was selected as a representative, then explained as the chairman of the National Assembly Representative Election Office, saying that the representatives announced by the National Government had been strictly reviewed by the office in accordance with the provisions of Article 4 of the Election Law and issued with representative qualification certificates. The Assembly has now been opened to the fourth meeting, and the review of qualifications is still being carried out, because it is feared that the representative qualification certificates are forged, so that the qualifications of the representatives can be more determined, which is purely to express caution and does not hinder the progress of the Assembly. However, the attendees still insisted that the review should be thorough, and the representatives who had been traitors should be reported to correct the situation. At the same time, in accordance with Article 2 of the General Rules of the Review Committee, the presidium and the secretariat were criticized, saying that the passage of this list was not a problem, but only reporting the number of people and candidates for this prerequisite to the Assembly, and the Central News Agency hastily released the action, which was an illegal act of power. For a time, the whole scene was full of speeches, attacks and rebukes, like a raging surge, and the interpretation of the calculation method of the quorum further fueled the flames. At 10:50, the order was in great chaos, and Chairman Zuo quickly accepted the suggestion of the attendees to put the list to a vote. As a result, the majority voted in favor of the passage, and the recess was announced. At 11:20, the meeting continued. Secretary-General Hong reported that the presidium had gathered and resolved three things: (1) Representatives who have not yet been sworn in will publicly take the oath of office at the fifth meeting on the morning of the 30th. (2) In accordance with Article 61 of the Rules of Procedure, the presidium will use the number announced by the National Government as the standard for calculating the quorum. (3) Please speak in front of the central microphone on the stage to seek clarity and maintain order. As a result, a storm came to an end, and the discussion of the constitution began.

### Bai Chongxi Convened the Ninth Pacification Meeting Yesterday

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 29th] Bai Chongxi hosted a banquet in the Ministry of National Defense conference room at 6:00 PM on the 29th for members of the Executive Yuan Pacification Zone Political Affairs Committee, Zhang Lisheng, Yu Hongjun, etc., and the chairmen of the provinces of Chahar, Shandong, Jehol, Henan, and Jiangsu. After the banquet, the ninth pacification meeting was held.

### National Assembly Representative Qualifications Determined for Group Review

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 29th] The National Assembly Representative Qualification Review Committee held its first meeting at 8:00 AM on the 29th in the representative lounge on the second floor of the Assembly Hall. Chairman Zhang Lisheng decided on the review methods: (1) Review will be carried out in several groups. (2) The Assembly Secretariat will be notified to request that representatives submit their certificates of election for review.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 29th] Chen Ruoqin, a representative of Guangdong professions, said that in the draft constitution amendment, the powers of the Legislative Yuan are even greater than those of the British and American parliaments. The powers of the National Assembly have been stripped away, leaving only the right to elect and impeach the president and the right to initiate and veto the constitution. He advocated restoring the four political powers that the National Assembly should have, so that the National Assembly, which is fully responsible for supervising the government on behalf of the people, is only in name and has no reality.

Wu Jieping, a representative of the Sichuan region, said that the draft constitution amendment, which the National Assembly is discussing as a basis, only took a few hours to complete the legislative process in the Legislative Yuan. This kind of fact is a rare occurrence in history. The perfunctory use of power is also against democracy. In the amendment, the powers of the Legislative Yuan are too large. He himself opposes centralization of power and also opposes checks and balances. The presidential system and the cabinet system were not adopted by the founding father. The Assembly should carefully study and revise this point in accordance with the legacy of the division of powers and functions. Regarding the management of election affairs, he advocated that the constitution should stipulate that it should be the responsibility of public opinion organs to eliminate abuses.

Liu Ruxin, a representative of overseas Chinese, said that overseas Chinese all over the world are unanimously willing to work hard for the construction of the motherland and requested that a clear policy of protecting overseas Chinese be included in the constitution.

Chen Yongxuan, a representative of Hunan professions, advocated three things: (1) The election of National Assembly representatives should also adopt a professional election system. (2) The number of women representatives should be stipulated. (3) The draft constitution amendment steals the name of the five powers and implements the reality of the three powers. It is similar to the American constitution and the past federal provincial autonomy law, which is worth studying and revising into a fundamental national law that is suitable for national conditions and in line with the times. Otherwise, even if the constitution is made, it is as if it has not been made.

Wu Wangji, a representative of Zhejiang professions, also advocated adopting professional elections to make up for the shortcomings of regional elections. He also said that the Legislative Yuan in the draft constitution amendment, except that it cannot turn men into women, can do everything as the central governing authority. The Executive Yuan is restrained by it, the Judicial Yuan becomes a vassal, the Control Yuan cannot supervise, the Examination Yuan cannot conduct examinations, and the National Assembly, the central political authority, cannot control it. After the general public elects it, it is even more out of reach. Such a Legislative Yuan will inevitably be lawless. He advocated that the Assembly should adjust its powers and status. By this time it was 12:00 noon, and Secretary-General Hong announced on behalf of Chairman Zuo that the meeting would continue at 3:00 PM.

### National Assembly Business Representatives

Request the Restoration of the Chapter on National Economy

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 29th] The National Assembly business representatives, at the invitation of the National Federation of Commerce on the 29th evening, jointly discussed (1) the professional representative system and (2) the restoration of the chapter on the national economy. More than 50 people, including Chen Qinshi, Han Guangqi, and Zhu Huiqing, attended. First, Wang Xiaolai, the chairman of the National Federation of Commerce, gave a speech, explaining that the clauses in the constitution regarding the election of National Assembly representatives and chairmen and supervisors only have regional representatives and ignore professional representatives. This point is far from the Prime Minister's legacy. Secondly, the original May Fifth Draft Constitution recorded a chapter on the national economy, with a total of 14 articles, but the current amendment deleted the chapter, and only 5 articles in the national policy involved the national economy. The merchants and guarantees of the people who are most concerned, and the clauses such as donations and taxes, are deleted, ignoring the interests of industry and commerce, and nothing is more serious than this. Agriculture, industry, and commerce are the foundation of the nation. If only the party politics vehicle of governing the country is paid attention to, and agriculture, industry, and commerce are ignored, it is tantamount to abandoning the fundamentals and pursuing the secondary. It is impossible to seek nation-building. It is recommended that the business community unite with agriculture, industry, and other sectors to jointly fight for it. It was then decided to use collective strength to submit proposals to the National Assembly Draft Constitution Review Committee in chapters.

### Regulations on the Organization of the Strategic Advisory Committee Promulgated: The Committee is Directly Under the Chairman of the National Government

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 29th] The National Government officially promulgated the regulations on the organization of the Strategic Advisory Committee. The original text is as follows:

Article 1: The Strategic Advisory Committee is the highest military advisory and wartime senior commander reserve organization, subordinate to the Chairman of the National Government.

Article 5: These regulations shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.

### A Glimpse of the Fourth National Assembly Meeting

— Our Reporters Pu Dejie and Zhang Ming

After a day of heavy snow on the 28th, the National Assembly Hall on the 29th was still adorned in silver. The white snow on the archway and the top of the hall was gradually melting under the early morning sunlight, dazzlingly beautiful. Together with the vermilion lacquer and gold painting on the buildings and the still unfaded green grass and trees, it was a magnificent sight.

The fourth meeting was chaired by Zuo Shunsheng. Zuo was graceful, calm and composed, but when speaking, he was always too far from the microphone, and many attendees could not fully understand his meaning, which was also a reason for the poor order.

National Assembly representatives took their seats according to the new seating arrangement on the 29th. Many representatives could not find their numbers. Someone said to a Mongolian representative with a smile, "We are in the front, the frontier is leading." A representative said, "Ha! Acquaintances are all sitting together." A representative said, "Limiting socializing has a bit of a feudal flavor."

Ma Xingye told reporters, "Mr. Huang Shaogu and I are both in the People's Rights Review Group. We want to propose that freedom of the press should be clearly listed in the constitution. The United Nations Charter even lists a special clause for it!"

Before the meeting, Bai Chongxi and Chen Cheng met and whispered for a moment. Zheng Yanfen started from his new seat and made a small circle to the left front, socializing in Cantonese Mandarin.

Sun Ke, the chief chairman of the fourth group of the presidium, went up and down the rostrum twice. The first time was when some representatives raised the issue of publicly taking the oath, and the second time was at 10:55, when the order was so chaotic that it could not be maintained. He went on stage and said a word to Chairman Zuo and Secretary-General Hong as he walked, and Chairman Zuo announced "recess" in the chaos, ending the dispute.

After the issue of taking the oath was raised, Secretary-General Hong reported, "The presidium has decided to send the oath to the representatives who did not attend the opening ceremony to take the oath, and ask them to fill in, sign and return it." Chen Jixian, a representative of the Henan professions, said, "No, taking the oath is a dignified matter. Why do it secretly? It should be taken publicly." Hong said again, "If you have any objection to the way the oath is taken, you can ask the presidium to discuss another method." As a result, it was decided to publicly take the oath at the Assembly on the 30th.

The list of members of the Representative Qualification Review Committee and the reporting of representatives who had been traitors caused a great uproar. The former was only reported to the Assembly without seeking consent, which violated Article 11 of the General Rules for the Organization of the Review Committee, "The number of people and candidates for the Representative Qualification Review Committee shall be proposed by the presidium to the Assembly for decision." Chen Jixian said, "This list has not been decided by the Assembly, and the Central News Agency has made an official announcement. May I ask if the Secretariat is deliberately violating the law or is confused? Please ask the derelict Secretary-General to resign." Wang Shuhui, another representative of the Henan professions, also asked the same question and asked Secretary-General Hong to explain. Hong stood up and wanted to speak, but Wang said, "I haven't finished speaking yet, please sit down, Secretary-General." Hong had to sit down, and Wang then criticized the next question: "Secretary-General Hong lightly dismissed the report of representatives who had been traitors as a 'judicial issue'. However, after Representative Zhang Lisheng spoke as the chairman of the Election Office, he could not explain it. May I ask if the representative only preserved the certificate of election without preserving their integrity, can the Secretary-General be responsible? We demand strict review and cannot let traitors join the sacred work of constitution-making."

For the sake of a list of procedures that were not in compliance with the announcement, the representatives launched a massive campaign to hold people accountable. Some said, "The presidium is serving the Assembly because there are too many people in the Assembly, not representing the Assembly to decide everything." Some said, "The powers of the presidium are too great, and the powers of the secretary-general are also not small. What do we representatives need to do?" Some said, "Just the chairman doesn't have to be afraid of trouble, and naturally there will be no trouble. This is a matter of law, not deliberately looking for trouble." Some said, "Everyone will have no problem with this list. If the presidium seeks everyone's consent after the report, it will definitely pass. We are reminding the presidium to pay attention to the legal regulations and respect the status of the Assembly."

Before the recess, speakers sprang up like mushrooms after the rain, and the order was in great chaos. People who were able to push through the crowd to win the right to speak also had to eat a mouthful. Guo Changhe, the third female representative to speak since the opening of the National Assembly, raised the matter of the resignation of Wu Yifang, the female chairman of the presidium, at that time, saying that it should be filled by the female representative with the most votes. Unfortunately, no one paid attention to her words. Zhu Jingnong said, "Please pay attention, colleagues, according to the rules of procedure, we must first obtain the chairman's consent to speak." "What about you?" "Shhh!"

In the chaos, Chairman Zuo announced the vote on that list, and most of the lights were turned on. During the recess, a representative said, "It still doesn't follow the regulations. The number of people and candidates should be voted on separately in order." Another representative said, "Just muddle through, Zuo Shunsheng is the chairman for the first time, forgive him."

Ma Shen Huiyun only arrived at the meeting during the recess. She said, "I went to Xiaguan to distribute clothes to the refugee children. I didn't finish until now. I'm frozen." The reporter said, "They are much warmer." She laughed. A National Assembly staff member who had worked in the Nanjing Red Cross said, "Our chairman is very good, both capable and enthusiastic."

At the fourth meeting, the representatives gained the upper hand. Although the order in the first half was chaotic, the spirit of the rule of law and democracy permeated the entire scene. When the problem was solved after the recess, the discussion of the constitution began, and it went smoothly until the adjournment. Everyone believes that if the representatives can pay more attention to the discussion part of the rules of procedure, and the presidium and the secretariat can clarify their relationship with them and the Assembly more clearly, the National Assembly meeting will definitely become perfect. Someone said, "The current Assembly itself is in a period of political tutelage."

In the speech of the female representative Bao Deming, she greatly praised the reporters. She said: Reporters, you are the mouthpiece of the people and also respect women's rights, so if public opinion can help, the goal can definitely be achieved.

A representative believed that a reserve president should be added to the presidential chapter, and the whole audience was silent. But a representative said calmly, "Don't be surprised, it should be strange at first, but it won't be strange later. All countries in the world have a three-power system, but our Prime Minister created a five-power constitution. At first, our country was very strange, but later it wasn't strange."

The Mongolian representative Liu Zongping spoke with passion, saying repeatedly, "We have traveled thousands of mountains and rivers and suffered all kinds of hardships. What are we here for? We want to be citizens of the Republic of China." His enthusiasm was full and won the applause of the entire audience.

A representative's speech was pretentious, empty, and said "you" at any time, with the intention of speaking outside of the representative's position. The whole audience immediately responded with hisses and jeers. When the last gentleman spoke, he even listed several points, hoping that everyone would pay attention, what to respect dignity, and what to be serious, and the whole audience was not impressed, as if they were listening to instructions.

### 法越衝突迄未停止　僑胞損失數千萬　我向雙方提出嚴重交涉

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] The conflict between French and Vietnamese troops occurred in Haiphong. Our Consul-General in Hanoi, Yuan Zijian, has been instructed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to make serious representations to both the French and Vietnamese sides, requesting that the Chinese quarter be excluded from the combat zone to avoid harming overseas Chinese.

[Central News Agency, Haiphong, 27th] (Delayed) A Central News Agency reporter accompanied French-Vietnamese mixed committee members here to mediate the French-Vietnamese conflict. After several meetings between the two sides on the 21st, the war continued on the 22nd due to disagreements. During the conflict on the 19th, our consulate in Haiphong was shot at by Vietnamese armed elements on the 22nd, and Consul Xie's office was also hit. After the 22nd, in the battle to suppress the Vietnamese, the French army used heavy weapons to attack Vietnamese concentrated areas, and the Chinese quarter was also affected. After five days of battle, the French army gradually advanced and controlled most of the urban area. The Vietnamese used the Chinese quarter as a cover to resist. Many fires broke out in the city. It is said that several places in the Chinese quarter were destroyed. Staff of the Chinese-language "Gang Dao Daily" are all in the Vietnamese area, and news is unknown. The newspaper has not been published for a week. In this conflict, the losses of overseas Chinese are feared to exceed tens of millions of Vietnamese currency.

[Associated Press, Paris, 28th] It is reported that the French government is considering sending reinforcements to Vietnam to help maintain order in response to the conflict. A recent telegram from Saigon stated that French troops had driven the Vietnamese Republican Army out of the Chinese quarter of Haiphong, and fighting is still ongoing in Haiphong and Lang Son. The Haiphong airfield has been retaken by 500 paratroopers sent by the French army.

[Agence France-Presse, Hanoi, 28th] After the conflict between French and Vietnamese troops in Haiphong and Lang Son, it has been learned that the conflict has stopped, and Haiphong has returned to normal and is peaceful. Radio companies have also resumed work. The Chinese consul has approached the Vietnamese authorities, requesting the release of two overseas Chinese who were arrested without cause. In addition, Chinese groups stationed in Vietnam have telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek about the French-Vietnamese conflict. French casualties are few. According to the chairman of the Lang Son Overseas Chinese Association, there were no casualties among overseas Chinese.

[Agence France-Presse, Hanoi, 29th] It has been learned that today, Vietnamese army coastal batteries in Capa, North Vietnam, fired on the French cruiser "Suffren" and a destroyer, but no damage was caused. The French commissioner for Tonkin and Annam, Mr. Lie, has protested to President Ho Chi Minh of the Viet Minh Republic, saying that he will be forced to take all appropriate measures to prevent the recurrence of such absolutely hostile acts.

### 善救物資秉公分配　絕無裝備軍隊事　行總發言人駁覆董必武

[Report from this newspaper] On the 27th of this month, Mr. Dong Biwu, representative of the Chinese Communist Party, issued a statement pointing out some matters regarding the distribution of relief supplies by the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA). In order to understand the truth, our reporter visited the CRRRA spokesman, who told us the following: The handling of UNRRA materials, in accordance with the basic agreement between the National Government and UNRRA, all matters concerning the distribution, storage, transportation, and issuance of relief supplies must be discussed and handled in consultation with UNRRA personnel. Especially for the issuance of supplies, UNRRA has regional representatives stationed in branch offices in each province to observe the distribution of materials. Mr. Dong Biwu said: "The authorities have directly or indirectly used UNRRA materials, equipment, and transportation to equip the army," which is obviously not based on facts. UNRRA staff in China, including citizens of various countries around the world, can all prove that Mr. Dong's statement lacks factual basis.

Communist Areas' Transportation is Blocked

Our office is the implementing agency for the basic agreement. Since its establishment, it has been continuously striving to request the CCP to allow our office's materials and personnel to enter CCP-controlled areas to provide relief to the disaster victims in those areas, and to provide our personnel with operational convenience, based on Article 2 of the UNRRA resolution, the principle of non-discrimination. For a year, our office has continuously transported relief supplies to CCP areas, but most CCP-controlled areas have always been under military conditions, with frequent battles, and transportation hindered. Material transportation is obstructed, and personnel have no safety guarantee in their work. This is a difficulty of the objective environment that cannot be resolved by the sole efforts of our office.

Ignoring Important Facts

Mr. Dong said: "Of the 1,130,349 tons of UNRRA materials arriving in China, the CCP areas have received only 9,820 tons to date, a proportion of only 7.5 per thousand." The proportion sought by Mr. Dong is only an abstract calculation, ignoring important facts. According to the situation, not every province in the country has a CCP-controlled area. Hubei, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces have the existence of CCP-controlled areas. Our office has eight branch offices in the above-mentioned areas. If the percentage of materials received by the CCP-controlled area is calculated, the sum of the materials obtained by the above-mentioned eight branch offices should be used as the denominator, and the sum of the materials distributed by this office to various branch offices should not be used as the standard. As of the end of October this year, the above-mentioned eight branch offices received a total of 224,207 tons of materials, and more than 22,000 tons of materials were sent to the CCP-controlled area, the ratio should be 10%, not 7.5 per thousand. Moreover, not all UNRRA materials have been distributed, some materials are being processed and assembled, some are still in transit, and some heavy equipment is not needed by the CCP-controlled area, such as railway equipment, the CCP does not have a railway organization, if it is allocated, it is tantamount to waste. Mr. Dong said, "The Communist area has only received more than 50 tons of medical equipment." This is the figure before June. At present, the CCP-controlled area has received more than 300 tons of medicine.

Overturning the UNRRA Resolution

Mr. Dong requested UNRRA to directly carry out the distribution and issuance of materials in the CCP-controlled areas, and said that "the CCP Liberated Area Relief and Rehabilitation Association provides the most effective assistance." I can answer Mr. Dong that the UNRRA Board of Directors has already stipulated in its resolution that the relief affairs of the countries accepting relief shall be handled by the governments of those countries themselves, and UNRRA shall not directly handle them. This agreement also has the same provisions. Mr. Dong's statement requires maintaining the UNRRA resolution and this agreement, but making this kind of accusation is tantamount to overturning the UNRRA resolution and the basic agreement. In short, our office has always based the distribution of materials on the principles of the UNRRA resolution, without any discrimination. In the future, we will also strengthen the relief work in various places with a consistent spirit, focusing on the needs of the people, without any discrimination. This original intention will surely be understood by all parties.

### 訪問國大代表　胡定安博士談衛生行政

In order to be concerned about the major issue of "national health", the reporter made a special visit to Dr. Hu Ding'an, representative of medical doctors and pharmacists. Dr. Hu is currently the president of National Jiangsu Medical College and the executive director of the Chinese Public Health Society. He has long advocated and been enthusiastic about public health. He distributed a booklet entitled "Why is Health Administration Not Included in the Constitution" to all the representatives at the conference the day before yesterday, elaborating in detail the close relationship between "health administration" and "constitutional government," and emphasizing that national health should be regarded as the foundation of the country in the Constitution. When the reporter asked Dr. Hu for his specific opinions on amending the constitution this time, Dr. Hu answered this question by listing Articles 120 and 122 of the Soviet Constitution, which both guarantee national health and have active implementation policies. After World War II, countries such as the United States, Britain, and France further regarded national health as a national resource. In particular, the British Health Act announced in March of this year, "All people enjoy free treatment," and Article 21 of the UN's New Bill of Rights, "The state guarantees that all people can enjoy national health and the protection of pregnant women, public health, and various measures derived from science," are the most prominent.

The short lifespan of our people, the high disease rate, and the alarming infant mortality rate make raising health standards an urgent requirement of the times. Therefore, I am very willing to invite colleagues in the medical field to propose that there must be clear provisions in the Constitution for healthcare and prevention, and further to increase the health of the people, in order to meet the needs of national construction. I also hope that colleagues in the press will give more publicity to "the importance of health" in terms of public opinion. This health right must be fought for by the people of civilized countries. In recent years, we have advocated national health and health education, and we have worked hard to promote it based on raising health standards.

Snowflakes were flying, and we talked for more than ten minutes under the window. We talked very enthusiastically about "health issues" and did not feel the cold before ending. We, from the standpoint of reporters, also expressed our sympathy for the common advocacy.

### 全國鐵路海港視察工作完成　損毀鐵路修復至戰前程度　預計需費美金三億八千萬

[Report from this newspaper] The inspection of railways and seaports in mainland China by the Executive Yuan's Engineering Planning Group has been completed, and the final report is now being compiled for submission to the Executive Yuan. The report includes the inspection process, the extent of damage, the materials, funds, and time required for repair. There were about 12,000 kilometers of railways in mainland China, and currently more than 3,000 kilometers have been damaged, more than half of which were destroyed by the Communist army. To repair all the damaged railways to the pre-war level would require an estimated US$380 million, which exceeds the original cost of constructing all the railways in mainland China. Even if the domestic situation stabilizes and there are no problems with funds and materials, it will take at least two and a half years to complete this repair work.

The Ministry of Communications plans to accelerate the repair of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and strengthen the Guangdong-Hankou Railway next year. Work on the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has now resumed. It is also planned to lay the Tianshui-Lanzhou section and the Guangzhou-Liuzhou section next year in order to complete the ideal northwest and southwest trunk lines.

As for seaports, from Huludao to Hainan Island, the damage is not as severe as that of the railways. According to the group's estimate, to repair it to the pre-war condition and make some improvements, it will cost about US$80 million.

It is also heard that the communications authorities plan to merge the Nanchang-Jiujiang Railway (from Jiujiang to Nanchang) and the Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway (from Hangzhou to Ningbo) into the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway for ease of management.

### 蘇北五里莊等處收復淮陰情形已穩定　膠東共軍增兵局勢又緊

[Report from this newspaper, Zhenjiang, 29th] The National Army has recovered Wulizhuang today, and the situation in Huaiyin is becoming more stable. It is also reported that Shi Tang, Ma Dian, Mao Qiao, and Wei Dian outside Huai'an were also entered by the National Army at the same time today. The Huaiyin-Zhenjiang long-distance bus service also resumed operations on the 29th.

[Report from this newspaper, Taixian, 29th] Mr. Li Mo'an was originally scheduled to come to Dongtai for inspection on the 29th, but due to rain, he may come here on the 30th. According to sources from Guan Xiang, Mr. Li may be stationed in Dongtai permanently in the future to command and deal with the current situation nearby.

[Report from this newspaper, Taixian, 29th] The Communists concentrated a regiment or more of troops and attacked the National Army's position at Jiulidian yesterday. The defending National Army counterattacked, and the two sides are currently facing each other near Xiaxi. It rained and snowed in Dongtai on the 29th, and there was no progress in the war.

### 蘇北五里莊等處收復　淮陰情形已穩定　膠東共軍增兵局勢又緊

[Report from this newspaper, Zhenjiang, 29th] Confirmed news: The situation in northern Jiangsu is not as serious as rumored. The elite troops of the National Army who rushed to Huaiyin from Xuzhou have crossed Suqian and Suining, and defeated the Zhang Aiping troops of the Communist Army who invaded the territory of Suining County, and are marching towards Siyang. People who know the geography of northern Jiangsu and the current military strength of the National and Communist armies told this newspaper's reporter that the Communist army's previous retreat from Gaoyou, Baoying, and Xinghua was originally a plan to preserve its strength, and it never made main contact with the National Army advancing on northern Jiangsu. Now it is moving after being extremely still. While the National Army is strictly abiding by the ceasefire order, it took the opportunity to launch an offensive. Whether from a military point of view or political influence, it is unwise. Because the National Army in northern Jiangsu is forced to fight on the plains, victory can be assured. He believes that once the National and Communist armies in northern Jiangsu enter a decisive battle, Lianshui, Shuyang, Yanfu can be recovered, and the problem of northern Jiangsu can be completely resolved at that time. The focus of the war in northern Jiangsu seems to be in the territory of Suqian, Suining, and Siyang, because the Communist army is trying to cut off the Xuzhou-Huaiyin communication line and put more pressure on the National Army in Huaian.

[Report from this newspaper, Jinan, 28th] The Communist army has greatly increased its troops and is actively deploying an offensive. The situation in Jiaodong has become tense again. The Communist army along the Jiaoji Railway has increased to 200,000, most of which are concentrated in Jiaodong. 50,000 of the New Fourth Army are in the Nanwangzhu area south of Gaomi, and 20,000 are near Lanzhuang north of Gaomi. The Communist army surrounding Yexian has also increased to 40,000. The Communist army disrupting the southern countryside of Jinan retreated to the south, and the air in Jinan was relieved. There was infighting among the Communist army in Taian. Anti-war slogans such as "Why are we still fighting after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War? We want to return to our hometown!" have been found in the city.

Commentary

### The Local System We Advocate

As the Constitution of the Republic of China is about to be drafted, we feel that the "Local System" chapter of the "Fifth-Fifth Draft Constitution" and the "Local System" clause of the Draft Constitution Amendment both need to be reviewed. Therefore, we offer our decades of research experience as a reference.

We also advocate that China should have a balanced local system. To achieve balance, we believe that the first step is to implement a "division." The relationship between the central and local governments has been ambiguous since the establishment of the Republic of China. As a result, the central government always claims that local authorities are separatist and fail to implement national laws, while local governments at all levels and the general public believe that the central government is moving towards extreme centralization, interfering at every turn, making it impossible to talk about autonomy. To correct this long-standing problem, we believe that it is best to separate everything. After separation, everyone handles their own affairs, maintains their own position, and does not interfere with each other.

How to divide? First: We advocate that provinces, counties, cities, townships, and towns should all be listed as local units. What is a local unit? (1) It must have a definite area; (2) It must have residents; (3) It must have an organization. This organization must be a legal person. Because it is a legal person, it can be a defendant and plaintiff in law, can have property, and has the right to dispose of property, can enter into legal contracts, and can levy taxes; (4) It must have a budget; above it, there is only a supervisory agency, not a command agency. Since the local unit is interpreted in this way, the local units of China should obviously be: (1) Province; (2) City (city under the Executive Yuan or city under the province); (3) County; (4) Township; (5) Town.

Cities, townships, and towns are the most basic local units because there are no local units below them. In France, cities, townships, and towns are called "Commune," and in Germany, they are called "Gemeinde," both of which are considered the most basic. If townships and towns are not on the same line as cities, it is unreasonable, and townships and towns will never have the hope of being established. Why have small cities and general villages in Europe and the United States reached such a level of modernization? It is because they have an autonomous government.

Second: We advocate a clear division between national administration and autonomous administration. There are three ways to divide: (1) List national administration and autonomous administration; (2) List national administration, and what is not listed is autonomous administration; (3) List autonomous administration, and what is not listed is national administration. We advocate the third method.

For the division process, we advocate that the state first divide with provinces and cities (cities under the Executive Yuan), and then the provinces divide reasonably with counties and cities (cities under the province). Finally, the county autonomous administration is then transferred and distributed to township and town units. Cities, townships, and towns are the local units closest to the residents, and we advocate that cities, townships, and towns should be allocated more autonomous administrative matters. For example: the following seventeen items should be listed as part of the autonomous administration, and should be allocated to city, township, and town units: (1) Fire protection; (2) Social education; (3) Roads and bridges; (4) Parks and fields; (5) Water conservancy; (6) Transportation (trams, buses, etc.); (7) Electricity; (8) Gas; (9) Public drinking water; (10) Cemeteries; (11) Food management; (12) Economic undertakings; (13) Local banks; (14) Cooperative undertakings; (15) Relief; (16) Housing management; (17) Public utilities. The purpose of autonomy is for residents to seek their own welfare. If the central government seeks these seventeen autonomous administrative matters on behalf of the residents, it will inevitably be irrelevant. If it is said that residents can use these seventeen items to resist the central government and declare independence, no one will believe it. On the contrary, the central government controls military affairs, diplomacy, police, currency, tariffs, national defense industry, trunk line transportation, education policy, and systems, etc. Who has the ability to resist the central government and declare independence?

Third: We advocate a clear division between national tax sources and autonomous tax sources. This can also be done using the principles and allocation methods of dividing national administration and autonomous administration. That is to say: autonomous tax sources are listed, and those not listed are national tax sources. After the national tax sources are divided with provinces and cities (cities under the Executive Yuan), the provinces and counties (cities under the province) will make a reasonable allocation, and the counties will further allocate them to the townships and towns. However, one point must be noted: in countries that practice autonomy, land tax (field tax) is mostly listed within the autonomous tax sources. Therefore, the most important item of China's autonomous tax sources is still the field tax.

Fourth: We advocate the nomination and election of heads of local units. The heads of local units have two identities. One is the representative of the central government, who, in the locality, accepts the orders of the central government (or its representative) to handle national administrative matters. The other is the head of the local autonomous group, who, in accordance with the resolutions of the autonomous legislative body, handles autonomous administrative matters. Since he represents both parties, why should he be selected by one party? Therefore, we believe that the election of provincial governors and county magistrates is not a fair method. In continental countries, county magistrates are mostly appointed by the central government. For example, the county magistrate in France is not elected by the people. China's feudal ideology has not been completely eliminated, and it is necessary to eradicate any possibility of separatism. If provincial governors and county magistrates are elected by the people, who can guarantee that they will faithfully implement the central government's decrees in the locality? It is possible for them to become regional strongmen in a moment's change. Some people say that the heads of local units in Britain and the United States are all elected by the people. Why is it that democratic China is not elected by the people? There are two answers to this question. One is that Britain and the United States are countries with extreme local decentralization. The second is that the national administrative matters that should be handled locally in Britain and the United States mostly have separate branches that directly command and handle them. The reason for this is that local autonomous governments are all elected by the people and cannot effectively implement central orders. As a compromise between the continental system and the British and American systems, we advocate that the central government nominate several candidates for the heads of local units and hand them over to the local residents for election, or that the local residents elect several candidates and report them to the central government for selection and appointment.

Fifth: We advocate that each unit head should have separate central and autonomous institutions. Since each unit head has two aspects of affairs to handle, why not clearly separate the handling institutions instead of mixing them together? One is a central institution, and the other is an autonomous institution. However, the head is just the same person. The central institution only follows the orders of the central government (or its representative), handles national administrative matters, its budget is part of the national budget, and temporary entrusted matters, such as construction, airport, etc., are also allocated special funds by the central government, without affecting local funds. The autonomous institution handles autonomous administration, and follows the resolutions of the local legislative body, in accordance with the autonomous budget, only responsible to the local area. If administrative disputes occur between the central institution and the autonomous institution, the administrative court will make a ruling, and the central government (or its representative) cannot resolve the disputes between the two parties with instructions. The method of dividing the central institution and the autonomous institution is not our invention. The Prussian system is like this, and it is effective. France was the first country to implement the method of administrative courts resolving disputes between the central and local governments. Except for Britain and the United States, almost all countries in the world that practice autonomy are like this.

Sixth: We advocate that local units should start autonomy at the same time, but the scope of autonomy can be different. Practicing autonomy without sufficient economic conditions is tantamount to idle talk. Practicing autonomy without sufficient intellectual conditions is simply like a blind man riding a blind horse. Mr. Sun Yat-sen saw this point, so there were regulations during the period of political tutelage. We advocate determining the conditions for autonomy. Where the conditions are sufficient, all autonomous administrative matters are handed over to the autonomous institutions for handling; where the conditions for autonomy are insufficient, a number of matters are proposed through legislative procedures and entrusted to the central institutions at the same level for handling on their behalf. Once the conditions are permitted, they will be returned to the autonomous institutions. Border areas, with backward culture and economy, naturally cannot talk about autonomy in terms of conditions, but it is also possible to start with one or two items. For example, relief and fire protection always seem to be manageable. This method is not our invention either. The autonomous administrative matters handled by local governments at all levels in the United Kingdom are different, and the autonomous administration in the United Kingdom is obtained bit by bit from parliamentary bills.

The above six items are our comprehensive propositions. We believe that only in this way can we obtain a constitution of balanced power. We have tried to talk about this constitution of balanced power with the ruling party, and we can actually receive unexpected effects. First, it can dredge the talents of the whole country and avoid the central government becoming the object of struggle. Second, from the central government to the city, township, and town units, there are central institutions that consistently implement the central government's decrees, and the so-called autonomy is only a few matters related to the lives of the residents, which is not enough to be the basis for resisting the central government and declaring independence. However, if the provincial governors and county magistrates are unconditionally elected by the people, then there is no guarantee. Standing on the side of the opposition party, it can also solve some problems and entrust infinite hope. For example, if the territory that has been obtained is not returned to the central government, everyone will say that you are separatist. If there is this constitution of balanced power, then what is returned to the central government is only national administration, and autonomous administration can obviously still be controlled. Isn't this solving the current so-called local regime problem again? Second, each level of autonomous institution, in addition to the central government's legal supervision, is not subject to the command of higher-level institutions. If each party, faction, and non-party faction can obtain the autonomous political structure of a local unit, they can also display their ambitions. However, if national administration and autonomous administration are not separated, or if national tax sources and autonomous tax sources are not separated, or if central institutions and autonomous institutions are not separated, then the central government of the ruling party will inevitably use its mixed powers to interfere with local autonomy.

At the final moment, we hope that the ruling party, the opposition party, and people across the country will consider this issue. That is, "The Local System We Advocate."

### The Executive Yuan's Zhejiang Office Allocates Funds to Build Straw Houses to Shelter Poor Farmers; 100 Houses to be Built in Each of Wukang and Several Other Counties

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 29th] Zhejiang is experiencing a severe housing shortage, especially in the counties of Wukang, Fuyang, Changxing, Hangzhou, and Xiaoshan, where the losses are extremely large. The Zhejiang Office of the Executive Yuan originally planned to build straw houses universally in rural areas to provide emergency relief, which would require 1.5 billion yuan. When Director Huo came to Hangzhou, he indicated that the work could be carried out first in areas with the greatest losses. Director Sun went to negotiate, but without success. Therefore, it was decided to allocate 100 million yuan from the Office's own funds to build 100 houses in rural areas of each county first. Families with three or more direct blood relatives will be provided with these houses free of charge.

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 29th] The Zhejiang Construction Department is stepping up construction. It has been holding symposiums on agriculture, transportation, water conservancy, and cooperation for several days to review work and study problems. It has also invited Yang Jiandong, Director of the Provincial Department of Transportation, to go to Beijing to exchange views with the directors of the transportation departments of other provinces and discuss national and provincial highway issues.

### Demolishing Dikes and Abandoning Fields in Yinshan Lake Affects the Livelihood of Thousands of Migrant Farmers; Joint Petition to Retract the Order

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 29th] During the period of enemy occupation, migrant vagrants in Yinshan Lake of this county had reclaimed a large number of lake fields along the coast. After the victory, local gentry, in view of the increasing occupation of lake fields, which hindered water conservancy and transportation, had requested that the fields be returned to the lake. However, the migrant farmers, relying on the fields for their livelihoods, expressed their opposition. At that time, the two sides argued fiercely. As a result, the authorities formulated a compromise plan to maintain the original state of the lake fields temporarily, while actively launching dredging and reclamation projects, which were handled by the Taihu Lake Basin Engineering Office, so as to avoid hindering water conservancy and transportation and seek a win-win situation. However, the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Committee recently received a telegram from the National Water Conservancy Committee, ordering it to immediately stop the dredging and reclamation project and to promptly demolish the dikes and open the dams in order to completely abandon the fields and turn them back into the lake, so as to maintain water conservancy and transportation. After the Lake Basin Engineering Office, after forwarding the order to the public, the migrant farmers along the lake caused an uproar. Everyone was terrified, because the reclaimed lake fields had reached more than 8,000 mu, which was the basis for the lives of thousands of migrant farmers. Once they were returned to the lake, the consequences would be worrying. They recently jointly submitted a petition to the county government and other relevant agencies, appealing to retract the order.

### The Suzhou National Goods Company Allowed to be Returned by the Enemy Property Bureau

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou] The Beiju National Goods Company, the largest commercial center in Suzhou, was founded in 1933 by industrial and commercial magnates and gentry. During the Anti-Japanese War, it was occupied by the enemy and renamed "Daimaru Company," operating department stores and extracting the blood and sweat of the people. After the victory, it was taken over by the Party and Government Reception Committee as enemy property and transferred to the Suzhou Office of the Enemy and Puppet Industry Disposal Bureau for disposal. The Board of Directors of the National Goods Company repeatedly requested its return. The Enemy Property Bureau has now approved the following three principles in principle: (1) The building structure will be temporarily allowed to be kept under guarantee after personnel verify it; (2) The furniture must be verified within five days with evidence; (3) Rebellious shares will be automatically reported and frozen. The Board of Directors of the National Goods Company has submitted a guarantee and is scheduled to take over the custody, so as to start restoration immediately.

### A New Highway to be Built from Yangzhou to Guazhou

[Our Newspaper, Yangzhou] The transportation between here and Zhenjiang, the provincial capital, is by steamboat on the waterway. The only highway is the "Jiewei Highway" (from Yangzhou to Liuweizhen). In recent years, the pier at Liuweizhen on the riverbank has collapsed due to river erosion, and the safety of travelers has become a problem. In view of this, the Jiangsu Construction Department recently plans to build a new highway between Yangzhou and Zhenjiang. The starting and ending points of the new highway are from Xinqiao outside the South Gate of Yangzhou to Guazhou. On the 26th, Technician Zhou Yushan arrived in Yangzhou to survey the route of the new highway. It is estimated that the entire construction project will be reported to the Jiangdu County Government for construction, bidding, and commencement of work as soon as the survey is completed. It is expected to be completed within this year and open to traffic on New Year's Day in 1947.

### Cabbage in Chongming is Mostly Hollow This Year

[Our Newspaper, Chongming] In the third and fourth districts of this county, a large amount of cabbage is planted. It is white in color, delicious in taste, and sold to Shanghai, where it is famous far and wide. It is now the harvest season, but since the beginning of autumn this year, there has been very little rainfall, so the cabbage hearts are dry and hollow, and the harvest has been greatly reduced. The price of cabbage has been falling in recent days, and sales have been sluggish, while various costs are extremely high, resulting in not a small loss for the general farmers.

### A Strange Thief in a Girls' School at Midnight; A Janitor Beats Him to Death; Four Assailants Sentenced to Seven Years Each

[Our Newspaper, Xi'an] The case of the janitor of the Provincial Girls' Normal School beating a person to death, which caused a sensation, was only given a single public trial by the Chang'an District Court on the 11th of this month and was sentenced on the 19th: the four janitors, who used weapons to beat to death a man disguised as a woman who sneaked into the girls' dormitory late at night on September 29, were all sentenced to seven years in prison. During the public trial last week, the principal of the school was not prosecuted, but only appeared in court as a body (because he was staying at the school that night when the incident occurred). He and the defense lawyers for the defendants all emphasized that the case was purely a theft by a villain and had no "romantic" element.

### The Kunshan Strike

[Our Newspaper, Kunshan] At about 8:00 a.m. on the 27th, Zhang Wujun, a graduate of the second phase of the Police Training Institute, went to the Fuxing Rice Store on Xiaoximen Street in the county in plain clothes to borrow a carrying pole for use. At that time, because the policeman's attitude was not good, a misunderstanding occurred between the two sides. Fang Liansheng, a member of the local Self-Defense Corps, went to mediate, but because the two sides' opinions differed, he angered the policeman, who beat the corps member. The situation was serious for a time, and the shops went on strike, demanding punishment for the perpetrator. It is reported that after this case occurred, it has been handled by County Magistrate Shen, and a complete solution has been reached.

### Winter Defense in Yangzhou

[Our Newspaper, Yangzhou] As the winter season is approaching, the military, political, and police authorities of this county, in order to prevent scattered bandits from entering the country, to prevent bandits from harassing, and to ensure security, have recently jointly organized a "Jiangdu County Military and Police Team Winter Defense Joint Command." A chief commander has been appointed, and Deputy Chief of Staff Chen Zhizhong of the Fourth Division of the stationed army has been designated to serve as the commander. Two deputy commanders have been appointed, namely Chief of Staff Liu of the Corps Management Zone and County Magistrate Zhang. Three groups, namely, General Affairs, Supervision, and Trial Training, have also been appointed. The headquarters is located in the county police station, and offices are set up in each district. The implementation time of the defense is from December 1 to the end of March next year in the urban and suburban areas, and from December 10 in the rural areas.

### A Bizarre Murder Case Occurs in Hushuguan; An Officer is Found Dead in a Barren Hill After Disappearing

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou] Sun Yuncheng, a student of the 52nd Company of the 7th Brigade of the 17th Officer Corps of the Central Training Corps stationed in Hushuguan, 27 years old, from Wuhu, was suddenly visited by a middle-aged man wearing a gray cloth shirt and pants who spoke with a northern accent on the morning of the 15th of this month. He visited Sun Yuncheng at the brigade headquarters, and his expression was very hurried. At that time, Sun had gone out on official business, and the man waited near the brigade headquarters for a long time until he left at about 5:00 p.m. Unexpectedly, Sun did not return to the team that day and was reported missing. People were sent to search everywhere, but there was still no news. The person in charge of the team thought that Sun worked in the department and usually did not leave his footprints. He was very disciplined. Now that he did not return, it was feared that there would be an accident. He immediately reported the information to the brigade headquarters and wrote to the Hushuguan Police Station and the town office, asking them to investigate strictly. According to the Hushuguan Police Station, a military corpse was found in the barren hills of the 13th Bao on the 18th and 19th, and it disappeared on the 20th. The team inquired about the corpse's height, appearance, and clothing, and they were very similar to the missing Sun Yuncheng. According to the situation, it was sufficient to prove that a bizarre murder case had occurred. In addition to sending personnel to strictly investigate and arrest the murderer, the brigade headquarters has sent a letter to the county police局, ordering them to assist in the investigation.

### Tang Enbo to Inspect the Border Areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui; To Depart Soon; To Instruct on Suppression and Pacification

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 29th] Commander-in-Chief Tang Enbo, in order to understand the real situation of the Suppression Zone in the border areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, is scheduled to go to the important areas of the three provinces for inspection in the coming days, and to instruct on the policy of suppression and pacification, so as to consolidate the security of Jiangnan. It is reported that after completing the inspection task in the border areas, Tang will go to Shanghai to report to the press.

[Our Newspaper, Haining] Bandits in various parts of this county are as rampant as ever. On the 27th, the Wu-Xia express boat was sailing from Tudian to Xia. When passing Shenchating on the way, four bandits suddenly came out and ordered the boat to stop. They searched and robbed for half an hour. Later, the Tu-Xia express boat was robbed again when passing the area. In order to prevent bandits, the county government has decided to divide the entire county into nine routes, with the cooperation of the police, security team, and security police team, to patrol day and night, in order to eliminate them.

### The Fengdong to Liuhegou Railway Will Soon Open to Traffic

[Our Newspaper, Xinxiang] After the National Army recovered Liuhegou, the Zhang-Luo Railway Engineering Team was ordered to go north to rush to repair the railway. Now the train between Anyang and Tangyin is unobstructed. It has now crossed the Zhang River Bridge north. As for the Feng-Liu branch line, two-thirds of it has been completed and is scheduled to be completed by the end of the month. The coal reserves in the Liuhegou Coal Mine are about 5,000 tons. Some of the machinery that was dismantled by the Communist Army has now been found in villages about 20 kilometers away from the mine. The workers of the mine are trying to transport them back for installation and resume production as soon as possible.

### The Central Government Will Send Personnel to Zhejiang to Investigate the Qilong Hydropower Project

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 29th] The Qilong Hydropower Project on the Qiantang River is being planned and built by the provincial government. It is now requesting the central government to allocate funds for joint construction. The central government has agreed in principle and may send personnel to Zhejiang to investigate the design work, which may be completed in half a year or a year.

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou] The Water Conservancy Commission of the Executive Yuan recently responded to the province's request for funds for various water conservancy projects as follows: (1) It is considered important to allocate 2.30494 billion yuan for the Cao'e River Flood Control Project, and 230 million yuan will be allocated from the Post-War Relief Fund of the Executive Yuan Water Conservancy Association, and the rest will be raised by the local government. However, it is found that the benefited land is only 32,400 mu, and each mu requires 72,400 yuan, which seems too large. It is necessary to re-study, distinguish between urgent and non-urgent, and consider saving measures. This allocation will be made after the local government has a way to raise funds. (2) The Executive Yuan believes that the request for 1.68716 billion yuan for the Xiaoshan Nansha Dike Project is related to the dike project on the opposite bank and should be handled in a coordinated manner. (3) It is approved to allocate an additional 50 million yuan for the Puyang River Flood Control Project, and the funds will also be allocated after the local government has a way to raise funds. (4) The request to increase the allocation for the Fuyang Chengnan River Dike Project is not approved.

### Improper Pricing of Reserved Seat Tickets

Since the victory, the two railway authorities have strived to rectify the transportation system, which is commendable. Since the implementation of reserved seating, order has been maintained and passengers find it convenient. However, the Railway Bureau's pricing for reserved seat tickets, especially for the "Jinling" and "Qiantang" express trains, two Beijing-Shanghai through trains with reserved seats, is genuinely unfair. For example, on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, the entire journey is 199 kilometers, and a second-class ticket costs 8,500 yuan. However, for these two trains, from Shanghai to Suzhou, or Suzhou to Shanghai, the distance is only 76 kilometers, less than half of the entire Shanghai-Hangzhou journey, yet the second-class ticket between Shanghai and Suzhou costs as much as 12,000 yuan. This is simply inappropriate in terms of both reason and fairness. Reserved seating is indeed well-organized and comfortable, and it is understandable that the ticket price is higher than ordinary special express trains, but it is unacceptable to place the entire price increase on short-distance passengers, causing them to suffer too much. If the Railway Bureau is concerned about the large number of reserved seat passengers and wants to limit it slightly, it could consider increasing the special express ticket price by a certain percentage as a reserved seat fee, which would be a more appropriate solution.

Furthermore, Suzhou Station on the Beijing-Shanghai line is known for its passenger congestion. I have traveled from Suzhou to Shanghai several times, and as soon as the train arrives at the station, it is already completely full. Adding a large number of passengers from Suzhou Station, there is sometimes no standing room on the carriage floor. Young people can manage, but women and children suffer. I hope the railway authorities will add Shanghai-Suzhou interval trains to benefit passengers. I hope the Railway Bureau will improve the above two suggestions immediately. (Editor's Note) Mr. Li Ronghua also sent a letter stating that the "Kaixuan" (Victory) train ticket prices between Suzhou and Changzhou were also inappropriate, which is published together.

Reply to Mr. Li Shangwen: Regarding your letter mentioning that the Zhushe (Bamboo House) cannot receive electricity, we have received a reply from the Shanghai Chinese Business Electric Company stating: "Upon investigation, Mr. Li's is a bamboo house. In the past, applying for electric lights was not subject to building permit restrictions. However, on August 1st, we received a letter from the Public Works Bureau through the Public Utilities Bureau, stating that electricity supply should be delayed for those who do not have a temporary shed permit from the Public Works Bureau. Mr. Li applied under the name of Shangwen Store on September 28th, so it was accepted, and the fee was collected first for the convenience of the user to avoid multiple trips. Later, after sending personnel to inspect, it was found that it was a bamboo house, which belongs to the scope of temporary sheds and has not obtained a building permit. According to the bureau's order, the power supply can only be temporarily suspended. If Mr. Li does not intend to obtain a permit, the original payment can be refunded in full upon presentation of the receipt to the company to conclude the matter." Please coordinate.

### The Third National Assembly

— Our reporter Zhang Ming

— The Preliminary Procedures for Returning Power to the People Have Been Completed —

The weather in Nanjing has taken a sharp turn for the worse. Today, snowflakes filled the city, painting the red buildings with white. The National Assembly archway stood erect in the wind and snow. The delegates attending the meeting still arrived on time, all arriving before nine o'clock.

Chairman Chiang, in his capacity as Chairman of the National Government, solemnly submitted this draft Constitution of the Republic of China to the Chairman of the Assembly, Hu Shi, in front of the National Representatives. At this moment of handover, a distinct line was drawn in the history of the Republic of China. This time was 9:45 AM on November 28th, 35th year of the Republic.

When the Chairman of the National Government handed over the draft Constitution to the Chairman of the Assembly, the Chairman of the National Government stood in front of the podium and first handed over the draft Constitution. The temporary Chairman then accepted it from the Chairman's seat. This scene was unprecedented. Many people said, "This is the first time Chairman Chiang has appeared in this posture."

Chairman Chiang's report was met with applause more than ten times. The first applause came when the Chairman said, "The National Government is submitting this draft Constitution today, beginning to hand over this responsibility to the people of the whole country, and the people of the whole country will also assume this responsibility from today."

Regarding the May 5th Constitution Draft, Chairman Chiang said, "Standing in the position of the people's representatives, I believe it is no longer applicable. I absolutely support the Constitution Draft submitted by the National Government today." The whole audience responded with even warmer applause.

Today's assembly procedure was only for submitting the draft Constitution and reporting, without discussion, so the atmosphere in the meeting hall was always harmonious. Especially because it was snowing heavily outside and the cold was biting, the air inside the hall seemed warmer. Hu Shi, in the guise of a diplomat, educator, and old professor, served as chairman, allowing him to be more than adequate. It was a pity that the program was simple, and it was truly a case of a hero having no place to use his skills.

Secretary-General Hong's recitation of the draft Constitution was clear and well-prepared in advance. The entire text was read in one breath, with appropriate intonation. The full text was 151 articles, starting at 10:20 and ending at 10:52, taking 32 minutes.

Yu Jiaju had a good interlude, which was also a program that made the conference more colorful. It was the written opinion put forward after the Chairman's report and Hong's official reading of the full text of the Constitution Draft. This was the first voice outside the Kuomintang to express support for the Constitution Draft, and it was also the first cannon fired by various parties since the opening, and this cannon was fired to everyone's delight.

During the break, the delegates went to the lounge for refreshments. Snow was falling heavily outside the window, and everyone shrank their necks and sipped tea. Someone said, "It's like Christmas." The Santa Claus of today brought a gift, a draft Constitution. When the draft was being read, female representative Zhuang Jing solemnly said to reporters, "In the chapter on legislation, the number of legislators is stipulated as five for each province or city with a population of less than three million. If the proportion of women is not specified, there will definitely be no female legislators in the future. We have to fight tooth and nail, at least five to one."

Sun Ke coughed frequently when explaining the draft Constitution.

Lei Zhen resigned from the post of Deputy Secretary-General but was not approved. Today, he was still turning around in the audience. It was not until nearly twelve o'clock that he ran to the stage and sat next to the chairman, flipping through documents.

The mercury lamps were turned on several times today for photography, and the reporters benefited a lot.

When the draft Constitution was being read, most of the audience listened quietly, a small number looked around, and occasionally a few read other newspapers and magazines. Chen Guofu and Hu Shuhua on the stage took notes, while Bai Chongxi supported his bald head with his hand.

At 11:40, the old man Kong Geng walked to the podium with a letter and handed it directly to Secretary-General Hong, repeatedly explaining that it seemed very important. However, reporters were unable to find out the details afterward.

When the hand pointed to twelve o'clock, Chairman Hu Shi stood up and asked the delegates for their opinions on extending the meeting by a quarter of an hour, ending his words with "Okay?" which was very much in the tone of speaking to students.

In the lounge, some hoped that the draft Constitution would be passed unanimously in one go, so they could go home early.

Jiang Yuntian of the Democratic Socialist Party attended today because he was attending the National Assembly for the Constitution.

### Outer Jordan Supported by Britain Attempts to Build a Greater Syria Nation A Struggle Among Arab Nationalities Has Been Aroused Turkey Seeks to Promote Close Ties with Near East Countries

[Central News Agency, Ankara, 28th] International disputes, internal hatred, and the ambitions of heroic figures have created various conflicts in the mysterious Arab lands. The ambitious King Abdullah of the independent state of Outer Jordan, supported by Britain, recently ascended the throne. His ambition to connect Palestine, Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq, and to obtain access to the Mediterranean Sea and the Persian oil fields to create a "Greater Syria Empire" with vast borders, has been reignited. The fierce Saudi Arabia is said to have not hesitated to use force to crush this ambition, and minor battles have reportedly occurred with troops opening into Outer Jordan. The Secretary-General of the Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs traveled to Ankara today to Outer Jordan to congratulate Abdullah on his accession to the throne, demonstrating spiritual support for the Greater Syria ambition.

[Agence France-Presse, Ankara, 29th] Turkish Foreign Ministry Secretary-General Erkin traveled to Outer Jordan last night to meet with the King of that country, and then went to Beirut to sign several agreements with the Lebanese government. People here are trying to keep this trip of the Foreign Minister secret. Political observers pointed out that after Turkey was forced away from the Balkans by Soviet forces, it is now seeking to promote ties with Near East countries. It is difficult to know whether there has been progress in the establishment of the "Eastern Bloc" sponsored by Britain, but the countries that Turkey wants to approach are all countries with the strongest British influence, namely Iraq, Outer Jordan, and Lebanon, which is also a fact.

### Montgomery Arrives in Palestine This Trip is Purely Military in Nature Internal War in Iran is Imminent

[United Press, Tehran, 29th] Iranian government troops have recently advanced north from Tehran, and it is widely believed that a major offensive against Azerbaijan Province is imminent. Armed farmers and villagers in Azerbaijan Province have already had minor contacts in two locations near the southern Kurdistan border. According to the current situation, it seems impossible for Prime Minister Sultanah's troops to monitor the elections scheduled for December 7th without entering Azerbaijan Province.

[Agence France-Presse, Tehran, 28th] Well-informed sources recently announced that the Iranian government will transfer oil rights to the United States to store kerosene in southern Iran. Storage locations include Baluchistan, Kerman, and part of the Fars region. It is said that American companies have been wanting to obtain this transfer right for many years.

### The Four Foreign Ministers Conference is Full of Compromising Atmosphere

[Our Correspondent in New York, 29th] The Four Powers Foreign Ministers Conference has reached a definite agreement today on the issues of Trieste and the Danube River. The focus of the discussion will then shift to the issue of $350 million in reparations for the five former enemy countries. If this issue is resolved, the peace treaty with the five countries will surely be resolved smoothly. There are still many difficulties at present, but it is widely believed that the peace treaty with the five countries may be signed before Christmas, and the 14 months of hard work of the four foreign ministers will be successfully concluded.

[Associated Press, New York, 29th] The four foreign ministers are excited that the peace treaty may be completed within a week and are working at the highest speed. Today, a showdown has been reached on the issue of the Soviet Union's request for reparations from Italy and Bulgaria, and that Yugoslavia should receive more than Greece.

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 28th] After resolving 27 minor disputes and ending the discussion on the treaties with Italy and the Balkans, the four foreign ministers turned to the issue of Danube River navigation in a friendly atmosphere tonight. The Soviet representative agreed with Britain and the United States in principle on the Danube River issue, but requested the insertion of a clause. The United States explained that this clause was intended to prohibit warships from navigating on the river. At the same time, British Foreign Secretary Bevin's proposal to invite Greece to participate in the Danube River navigation country conference was also opposed by Molotov.

### The Soviet Union Changes Its Position on Disarmament Case Agrees to International Supervision System But Still Wants to Use the Veto Power as a Talisman

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 28th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov suddenly agreed to implement an international management and supervision system for verifying the reduction of armaments and banning atomic bombs in the UN General Assembly Political Committee today on the most controversial issue of disarmament, which was unexpected. The Soviet Union's original position was to oppose universal inspections. Now Molotov has changed his policy and stipulated that this international management agency should carry out its work under the Security Council because it has the veto power in the Security Council. In his supplementary proposal, Molotov stipulated that in order to ensure the adoption of disarmament and the prohibition of the use of atomic energy for military purposes, the following two committees should be established in the Security Council as special supervisory bodies: (1) managing the implementation of disarmament resolutions, and (2) managing the implementation of resolutions prohibiting the use of atomic energy for military purposes. American representative Connally did not immediately comment on this. British representative Sharkcross explained the British position, stating that the proposed supervisory system must not be affected by the veto power.

### The UN General Assembly Discusses India's Complaint Gu Weijun Delivers a Speech Disapproves of Submitting to the International Court of Justice Advocates for Direct Negotiations Between the Parties

[Our Correspondent in New York, 29th] Regarding India's request for the United Nations to take action to stop racial discrimination in South Africa, it is now being studied by the Political Security and Legal Committees. Our representative Gu Weijun spoke in the committee and opposed the proposal that the United Nations agency should send the case to the World Court for legal adjudication as to whether the United Nations has the right to interfere. Gu said that South Africa's discrimination against all Asians concerns the face of the entire Asia and the rights of half of humanity. Therefore, he agrees that the United Nations should decide, and does not agree that the International Court of Justice should adjudicate. It would be even more appropriate if India and South Africa could resume negotiations and seek a solution themselves. Soon, Gu formally proposed a motion requesting that a subcommittee be organized with representatives from India, South Africa, and other countries to study the issue and propose a draft resolution as a basis for the two countries to resume negotiations. The Czech representative expressed full support for this proposal.

Indian representative Mrs. Pandit still requested that the case be decided at the United Nations. She also stated that India's submission of the case was entirely based on a friendly spirit and had no provocative intention. The purpose was to make the world understand that India faithfully believes in the Charter and is willing to implement all the provisions of the Charter as soon as possible so that the future of mankind can be guaranteed.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 28th] President Truman distributed the 100 books of the reparations plan proposed by Reparations Commissioner Paulley to the members of the House of Representatives, the Senate, and the Foreign Affairs Committee for reference today. The report calls for a severe reduction in Japan's heavy industry to eliminate its military and economic potential. The main points are as follows:

(1) Japan's pig iron production will be reduced to 500,000 tons per year, which is about one-fifth of the 1937 level; steel production will be reduced to 2.5 million tons per year. (2) The chemical industry will be completely eliminated, with the exception of fertilizer plants.

(8) Materials for the manufacture of nickel, chromium, magnesium, tungsten, molybdenum, and aluminum will all be used as reparations to the Allies.

[Associated Press, Washington, 28th] According to this issue of "World Report" weekly, the US government will be forced to take unilateral action on the Japanese reparations issue, directly ordering MacArthur to immediately distribute 20% of the materials allocated by Japan as reparations to the countries requesting reparations. Before the issuance of this order, consultations will still be held with representatives of the countries concerned, but regardless of whether a final agreement can be reached, the United States will insist on immediate distribution. The recommendations made by MacArthur on the distribution situation will be reviewed by the Far Eastern Commission. Even if the Soviet Union objects, MacArthur will still implement it in his capacity as the representative of the main occupying country.

### The Reorganization of the Indian Government (Middle)

— Zhou Xiangguang, Special Correspondent in India for This Newspaper

This is the view of both Hindus and Muslims towards the Muslim League's participation in the government. The opinions of us, the third party, may not be definitively determined at this time. We should observe its future developments to understand its true meaning. Later, on the 20th of this month, all parties were eagerly awaiting to see who Jinnah would recommend for cabinet positions. However, after Jinnah announced the five Muslim League members participating in the government, it greatly surprised the Hindus. Among the five Muslim League representatives, one, Jogendra Nath Mandal, belonged to the "Untouchable" class of Hindus. He is currently the Finance Minister of the Bengal Provincial Government and has long had connections with the Muslim League.

It is said that among the "Untouchable" class in India, there have always been two organizations: one belonging to the Congress Party, led by Ram; the other is the Scheduled Castes Federation, led by Mandal. However, for the past twenty years, it has never been recognized by the Congress Party, but has formed an indissoluble bond with the Muslim League. Therefore, Jinnah's recommendation of this person for a cabinet position is to use him to counter the Congress Party's use of Asef Ali (Asaf Ali) to attend the new government. At that time, old man Gandhi also lost his temper, saying that since the "Untouchable" class was recommended by the Congress Party, why would the Muslim League, claiming to represent Muslims, choose a Hindu "Untouchable" representative? It was quite strange. However, Jinnah's move was very clever, winning applause from outsiders. At that time, the Delhi "Hindustan Times" published a cartoon satirizing Islam, which was quite interesting. The cartoon depicted a large hen (i.e., Jinnah) leading out four chicks (i.e., the Muslim League's cabinet representatives), but at the end, there was a duckling (i.e., the "Untouchable" representative), causing the old woman (i.e., the Governor-General) on the side to be greatly surprised! After Mandal, the leader of the Scheduled Castes Federation, was recommended by the Muslim League for a cabinet position, more than a thousand "Untouchables" in Delhi gathered at Jinnah's residence to express their gratitude. Jinnah then gave an impromptu speech, saying, "I am not only your friend, but I will always be your good friend. I will do everything possible to help with the interests of the 'Untouchables'," and so on. Finally, more than a thousand "Untouchables" shouted the slogan "Pakistan! Zindabad!" which means "Long live the Muslim holy land," making the Hindus who saw it both angry and amused.

Now that Muslims are participating in the government, the issue of the allocation of positions in the new government has become the focus of discussion among the Congress Party, the Muslim League, and the Governor-General. Originally, the two Muslims in the new government, one, Zahir, the Minister of Posts, Telegraphs and Aviation, and Khan, the Minister of Education and Health, as well as Bose, the Minister of Industry and Mines, resigned at the same time to allow the Muslim League representatives to take their positions. It was previously reported that Jinnah had requested the Governor-General to give the Muslim League the ministries of Foreign Affairs or Interior, Supply or Commerce, Defense or Finance, while giving the Ministry of Industry and Mines to the "Untouchable" representative, Mandal. However, the Minister of Defense belongs to the Sikh religion, Bauder Shen; the Minister of Commerce belongs to the Parsi religion, Bafu; and the Minister of Finance belongs to the Indian Christian religion, Mede. These three ministers all belong to minority ethnic groups and are not easily given up, while the Ministry of External Affairs must belong to Nehru, and the Congress Party is unwilling to give the position of Minister of Interior to the Muslim League. Therefore, the issue of ministerial allocation has become the most difficult problem to solve in the reorganization of the Indian interim government.

### Cold Wave Hits Shanghai, Frozen Corpses on the Streets, Busy Burials at Pushen Cemetery, Relief Work Cannot Be Delayed

[Report from This Newspaper] Yesterday, the climate in this city became even colder, with the minimum temperature dropping to 37.2 degrees. The maximum was only 44.7 degrees. However, the sky cleared up from the afternoon. According to the meteorological station report: the center of the cold wave has reached the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. This morning and evening will still be cold, and the temperature at noon may increase slightly. It is expected that the cold trend will subside after tomorrow. However, another cold wave is predicted to follow soon, around mid-December, and its coldness will set a new record for this year.

Under the severe cold of winter, the poor people feel a serious threat, especially the refugees and beggars who wander the streets without a home. They are scantily clad, starving, and freezing. The number of people who die on the streets is increasing daily. According to news from Pushen Cemetery: the cemetery collected a total of 65 corpses of people who died on the streets the day before yesterday, of which 54 were children's corpses. Yesterday, the number reached more than 70, and most of them were also children's corpses. The burial work these days is extremely busy.

It is only early winter, and the number of people who die on the streets has already exceeded the previous year's record. In the future, when the severe cold is even worse, the situation of the poor freezing and starving to death throughout the winter will be unimaginable. Therefore, winter relief work cannot be delayed. According to news from the Social Affairs Bureau: the bureau has built a winter shelter in Tongzhou Road, Hongkou. It is currently rushing to install water and electricity equipment, and is expected to start accommodating 4,000 refugees by the middle of next month. The Executive Yuan has agreed to allocate the first batch of 800 quilts, 800 sets of cotton clothes, and one bag of flour per person per month. In terms of funding, the Municipal Council has approved the allocation of 900 million yuan for winter refugee relief, but the Social Affairs Bureau has only received 50 million yuan. It is reported that the municipal government will continue to allocate 350 million yuan soon, and the 200 million yuan promised by the central government is also in the process of being approved. In addition, donations from all walks of life are hoped to strengthen the relief efforts.

The Shanghai Meteorological Joint Report is recorded as follows:

The Siberian anticyclone center is in Northwest and Central China, covering the whole country, Korea, Japan, the East China Sea, the Ryukyu Islands, and the northern part of the South China Sea.

Weather forecast: Yellow Sea, cloudy, clear, cold, with frost, strong northwesterly winds, huge waves. Central China, cloudy, clear, cold, morning fog, moderate northerly winds.

Shanghai, cloudy, cold, with frost, clear, light haze, morning fog, moderate northwesterly to northeasterly winds. East China Sea, overcast, turning cloudy, cold, strong northerly to northeasterly winds, huge waves. Temperature on the 29th: maximum 44.7 degrees, minimum 37.2 degrees.

### Difficult Implementation of New Tax Law, Improvement Expected After Consultation, Director Gu Returns to Shanghai to Talk

Due to the tax revenue issue in this city caused by the new tax law passed by the Legislative Yuan, Gu Chunfan, Director of the Finance Bureau, went to Beijing to explain to the relevant central authorities and requested reconsideration to suit the local situation. He has now returned to Shanghai. When the reporter went to ask about the consultation process in Beijing, he said: The implementation of the new tax law in this city does have difficulties. Therefore, he went to Beijing to consult with various parties, who all said that methods could be found to improve it. However, because this matter involves the Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Interior, it cannot be decided by one person's words. Moreover, Premier Song was busy with official duties and Minister Yu was ill, so they could not have a thorough discussion, so there was no concrete reply. Finally, Gu also denied external rumors that this trip to Beijing was related to the municipal budget, saying that it was not true because the municipal government only needs to report the municipal budget to the Municipal Council and does not need to ask the central government for instructions. Moreover, the rumored shortfall of 200 billion is even more unreliable.

### The Profit Tax of the 34th Year is Too Burdensome for Industry and Commerce

Pan Shihao Says Remedial Measures Should Be Taken

Among the industrial and commercial enterprises in this city that are overwhelmed by the profit tax of the 34th year collected by the Direct Taxation Bureau, there is much complaining. It is heard that the Chamber of Commerce authorities, believing that the deadlock must be broken, have scheduled a symposium to be held at 4:00 p.m. on Sunday. According to Pan Shihao, the simplification of the audit and collection of the profit tax of the 34th year is due to the fact that the budget set by the Ministry does not allow for further reductions, resulting in the saying that 150% of the declared surplus will be taxed. Judging from common sense, the burden on industry and commerce is indeed very heavy, especially since the prosperity of various industries varies. Those who had a surplus at the end of last year may have lost their ability to bear the burden now. Moreover, the so-called tax of 150% of the surplus may not be uniformly applied in practice. It is not surprising that some industrial and commercial enterprises are complaining. However, the Chamber of Commerce's original intention was that since the request for exemption was impossible and the investigation and audit were even more undesirable for all industries, it was a measure to reduce the budget and allocate the tax according to the accounts in the face of necessity. Now that it has been discovered that some industrial and commercial enterprises cannot bear the additional tax because their declared amount was already very large, remedial measures should be taken. According to Pan, industry and commerce are facing increasing difficulties, and various donations and taxes should be changed according to the situation. The two taxes on salaries and interest, in particular, should take into account the strength of the entire people and stop collecting them. Pan also said that if this matter is not resolved satisfactorily, he will go to Beijing to meet with the responsible officials and strive for a solution.

### Improve Interbank Lending, Promote Lending Bills

Yesterday, the Shanghai Banking Association invited representatives from national banks and commercial banks to hold a meeting to discuss the following important cases: (1) In order to improve the interbank lending method, the association has repeatedly promoted lending bills. Recently, it intends to add a promissory note from the borrower to the fixed-term loan, and use the drawer's correspondent bank as the payer of the promissory note, which is convenient for exchange and also beneficial for interbank rediscounting. However, a contract must still be signed with the lending bank. It is currently under research. (2) If the draft stub has not arrived, the check cannot be returned according to law. For prudent consideration, the bank may issue a fixed-term draft or a sight draft followed by a fixed-term payment after obtaining the consent of the remitter. This suggestion has been communicated to the industry by the Banking Association in Circular No. 162, and should be followed uniformly.

### Human-Powered Vehicles Converted to Three-Wheelers, Inspection and Licensing to Start Tomorrow

[Report from This Newspaper] In order to eliminate human-powered vehicles in this city, according to the central government's order, it must be completed within two years. At the latest, by the autumn of the 37th year, all human-powered vehicles in this city must be eliminated. Therefore, the Public Works Bureau encourages human-powered vehicle owners to convert them into single-seat three-wheeled vehicles as soon as possible, and has drafted a licensing and taxation method, which is planned to start inspection and licensing from tomorrow. The fees to be collected, in terms of license tax, those who have already paid the human-powered vehicle tax for December will be exempt from vehicle tax after changing to a three-wheeled vehicle license. Those who have not paid the human-powered vehicle tax for December will be allowed to pay one-sixth of the three-wheeled vehicle tax for the second half of the year after changing to a three-wheeled vehicle license, that is, a total of 3,333 yuan for one month in December (calculated as 3,400 yuan). As for the registration, inspection, and licensing part, the cost of the license and various administrative procedures are required. It is proposed to collect a license fee of 7,500 yuan, a registration fee of 1,500 yuan, and an inspection fee of 1,500 yuan, for a total of 10,500 yuan. As for the issuance of vehicle owner certificates and the collection of security deposits, due to insufficient time to handle them, they will be postponed until April 1st of the 26th year, and will be handled together when the vehicles are relicensed, in order to reduce the amount of fees collected this time.

The human-powered vehicles to be eliminated this time, except for those whose owners have only one vehicle, which will not be eliminated for the time being, total 1,944 vehicles. There are already 1,955 vehicles that have applied to the Public Works Bureau to be converted into three-wheeled vehicles. This shows that vehicle dealers have a general understanding of the need to eliminate human-powered vehicles.

### Xu Xueyu Returns to Shanghai to Talk About the Smooth Promotion of Shipping Affairs in Taiwan Province, The Taiwan Shipping Company Will Be Formally Established Tomorrow

Xu Xueyu, the general manager of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, went to Taiwan last Saturday to inspect the company's business in Taiwan Province and to attend the establishment of the Taiwan Shipping Company. He returned to Shanghai from public affairs on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. He said: In order to develop shipping affairs, the company found that most of the warehouses left by the Japanese in Taiwan that should have belonged to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company were badly damaged and unsuitable for use. Therefore, the main task of this trip was to inspect the company's warehouses and design their renovation for application. In addition to setting up a branch office in Taipei, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has also set up offices in Keelung and other places, so the promotion of shipping affairs in Taiwan Province is quite smooth. As for the Taiwan Shipping Company, it is hosted by the Taiwan Provincial Administrative Office and has been formally established. Currently, there are only two ships, the Taipei and the Tainan, which regularly sail to various ports in Taiwan Province. Since the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Taiwan Shipping Company are both state-run institutions, they are specially invited to cooperate. Therefore, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is now one of the shareholders of the Taiwan Shipping Company. In addition, General Manager Xu had discussions with the Taiwan Provincial authorities on increasing the transportation of coal and the shipment of Taiwan rice. Currently, 60,000 tons of Taiwan coal come to Shanghai every month. If transportation can be smooth, the amount of Taiwan coal shipped to Shanghai can continue to increase. In addition, in order to save expenses and adjust the order of shipping, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has recently formulated liner schedules for various routes, which will be implemented from next month.

[Another News] The Taiwan Shipping Company held an establishment meeting yesterday and is scheduled to be formally established on New Year's Day next year.

Xu Xueyu will serve as chairman of the board, and Ren Xianqun, director of the Taiwan Provincial Transportation Office, will concurrently serve as general manager. It is reported that regular shipping routes will be opened from Taiwan to Shanghai, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, Guangzhou, Qingdao and other places, and transportation between Kaohsiung and Shanghai will be strengthened, and warehouses and loading and unloading facilities in Kaohsiung will be increased to restore Kaohsiung's prosperity.

### Clearing Bayer Factory Inventory, Two-Thirds Completed to Date, Value Exceeds 5 Billion

[Report from This Newspaper] The reporter recently visited a person in charge of the Bayer Pharmaceutical Factory Clearance Office and asked about the progress of the office's clearance work. He said that the office received the Bayer Pharmaceutical Factory from the Municipal Health Bureau on November 24th last year. Upon immediate inspection, the inventory was roughly worth more than 2 billion yuan at the time. Two-thirds of the inventory has been cleared over the past year. The proceeds from the clearance have exceeded 5 billion yuan. It is claimed that the office's initial regulations for allocation and distribution did not restrict the sale of medicines with large inventories. Rare medicines were allocated and distributed in combinations, with each combination tentatively priced at 100,000 yuan. The targets for allocation and distribution were divided into two types: (1) Pharmacies in this city that sell Western medicines and apply for allocation and distribution were allocated and distributed according to their business conditions, with first-class pharmacies receiving three combinations, second-class pharmacies receiving two combinations, and third-class pharmacies receiving one combination. (2) Public hospitals in this city with dispensing departments, and hospitals of a charitable nature. Hospitals in other cities must have proof from the local government. The allocation and distribution price was based on the principle of being slightly lower than the market price. On January 13th of this year, the scope of allocation and distribution was expanded, and each combination was increased to 500,000 yuan. The targets for allocation and distribution were expanded to include government agencies and public affairs medical rooms in this city, and registered doctors in this city. At the same time, pharmacies were divided into five levels, from Grade A receiving eight combinations to Grade E receiving one combination. On April 7th, sales venues in other counties were also added. From July 1st, because the quantity of each type of inventory varied, the previously approved allocation and distribution targets were no longer allocated and distributed uniformly, and a bidding method was adopted. At the same time, at the request of the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association of this city, the allocation and distribution to pharmacies was still maintained. However, it has been reduced by level, from Grade A receiving five combinations to Grade E receiving one combination. In addition, a special grade was added, giving eight combinations to maintain the actual needs of each pharmacy. In addition, Bayer Pharmaceutical Factory agents in other cities who have had business relations in the past were also given allocation and distribution at the discretion of their business needs.

### Zhoushan Ship Loaded with Smuggled Goods, Rumors Inconsistent with Facts

[Report from This Newspaper] The Zhoushan ship of the Zhoushan Shipping Company returned to Shanghai from Fuzhou the afternoon before yesterday. There were rumors that the ship was detained for loading a huge amount of smuggled goods. Yesterday, the company claimed that this was inconsistent with the facts. It also said that when the Zhoushan ship was about to leave Fuzhou to return to Shanghai this time, three small wooden boats suddenly approached. An armed person immediately loaded the boats onto the ship. After being rejected by the crew, the armed person said that he had other official business and would arrive soon. The crew believed it to be true and immediately started loading. Later, after being discovered by customs officers, the customs officers did not allow the goods to be shipped because there were no customs procedures, and a dispute arose with the customs officers. As a result, only one small boat was loaded, with only more than twenty wooden boards. The remaining two boats were sent away. The customs officer immediately reported to the Fuzhou Headquarters, and the Headquarters telegraphed Shanghai to inquire. The rumor that the Zhoushan ship was detained was actually inaccurate. As for the wooden boards, they were temporarily unloaded in Shanghai and are being kept by the company. The ship is scheduled to leave for Fuzhou at 4:00 p.m. today.

Subsequently, city councilors Fei Shusheng, Wang Jian'e, and others expressed their opinions. The Director of the Fire Department responded, stating that the City Council had approved a budget of one billion yuan for fire prevention, of which 500 million yuan has been approved by the Mayor and is expected to be available by the end of the year, while the remaining 500 million yuan is still pending approval. Regarding fire department discipline, citizens are encouraged to report any violations at any time, and if the evidence is conclusive, severe punishment will be imposed. Regarding the management of street vendors in alleys, the relaxation of alley area restrictions, and the insufficient water supply in Nanshi, the department will gradually improve these issues.

### Jing'an Temple Police Chief Discusses the General Situation of Dividing Police Precincts

[Report from our newspaper] Following the Changshu Road Police Station, the Jing'an Temple Police Sub-bureau in this city has also implemented a police precinct system. A reporter visited Zhou Weiting, the sub-bureau chief, yesterday and obtained a detailed explanation. According to Zhou, the police precinct system is based on Article 11 of the "Outline of Organization for Police Agencies at All Levels," promulgated by the Executive Yuan on July 25, 1936. The police duty of each level of bureau and office should adopt the patrol system in principle and may divide the area into several police precincts as the basic units for police officers to perform their duties. The division of police precincts is based entirely on population density, the prosperity of industry and commerce, traffic conditions, and the cooperation of the Baojia organization. The Jing'an Temple Sub-bureau jurisdiction has a total of 31,651 households, 164,608 people, 35 Bao, and 955 Jia. It has been divided into 217 police precincts. For the sake of implementing duties conveniently, seven police precincts are combined into one joint precinct, for a total of 31 joint precincts. The duty system of the joint precinct is a seven-person, three-shift system, adopting a 4-hour patrol and mutual watch system. The seven police officers are divided into three shifts, with two officers per shift, each shift working for four hours. During the four-hour duty, each police officer patrols for two hours and stands guard for two hours. Every hour, the patrol officers switch positions to alleviate mental strain. Two officers rest, and three shifts take turns. The other police officer rests for the whole day and has one day off every seven days. After the implementation of the police precinct system in the sub-bureau, the following work goals are scheduled within three months: (1) Prevent theft cases from occurring. If they occur, they should be solved as quickly as possible. (2) Clean up the city's appearance. (3) Street vendors should be absolutely prohibited except for designated streets and alleys. (4) Parking areas should be orderly. (6) The household registration should be clear.

### Korean "Goddess" Dies of Syphilis: Corpse Abandoned on Roadside Due to Lack of Funds for Coffin

[Report from our newspaper] On the east side of the railway at Songhu Road and Xibaoxing Road, around 6:00 PM on the 24th, a female corpse wrapped in a torn mat was discovered. The deceased was over twenty years old, wearing a printed calico cheongsam, a light green zip-up shirt, white cloth shorts, and tan canvas shoes with brown socks. After being reported to the local police station, the judicial authorities were notified to send personnel to examine the body. It was learned that the female corpse had died of illness. It was also found that the deceased had syphilis and appeared to have been a "goddess" before her death, in a pathetic state. After an investigation by the police authorities, it was learned that the deceased was a prostitute from 46 Zhengxing Lane, Guangdong Street. Wang Debiao, the owner of the brothel, was summoned and stated that there were three Korean prostitutes in the brothel. The deceased was also Korean, known as "Old Drunkard" because of her love of alcohol. Her real name was unknown. The woman had been working as a "goddess" and had only been at the brothel for over ten days, splitting the earnings. She had been infected with syphilis and suffered from severe stomach problems. Her body was weak. She did not receive any customers on the night of the 22nd and went to sleep alone in her room. The next morning at 7:00 AM, Wang Debiao's daughter (named Dongbao, 11 years old) entered the room to sweep and found her lying stiff on the bed, lifeless. Afterwards, due to financial constraints, Wang was unable to afford a coffin and hired two beggars to wrap the deceased in a single quilt, cover her with a torn mat, and instructed them to send her to Pushan Villa, giving them 30,000 yuan as payment. However, they abandoned the corpse on the roadside, and he was unaware of this. The police station, believing that Wang, although unable to afford a coffin due to poverty, abandoned the corpse on the road, which was inhumane, charged him with the crime of abandoning a corpse and submitted the case to the judicial authorities for review.

### The Downfall of Warmongers: Enemy General Okabe Dies of Illness; Commanded Several Major Battles in Changsha and Northern Hubei During the Invasion of China; Suddenly Suffered a Cerebral Hemorrhage and Died the Same Evening

[Report from our newspaper] Japanese General Okabe Naozaburo, an unconvicted prisoner held at the Shanghai War Criminal Detention Center of the First Pacification Area Command in Shanghai Prison, died of cerebral hemorrhage at the prison hospital at 7:15 PM the night before (the 28th). The military court was preparing to bring this major invader of China to trial and impose the punishment he deserved, but he suddenly died of an acute illness. He was fortunate.

Okabe was 60 years old, a native of Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan. At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War in 1937, he served as the Chief of Staff of the North China Expeditionary Army, stationed in Tianjin. In 1939, he was transferred to be the Commander of the Garrison Army in Mongolia, responsible for attacking Zhangjiakou, Shanxi, Suiyuan, and other places. In 1940, he returned to Japan as the Minister of Technology. In 1944, he was transferred to be the Commander of the North China Area Army. When Japan surrendered last year, he was still the Commander of the Sixth Area Army, stationed in Wuhan. The Changsha Campaign and the Hubei-North Hubei-South campaigns, which lasted for years, were all under his main command. After the victory, he was arrested by our government and transferred to the Shanghai War Criminal Detention Center on August 6 this year.

According to the warden of the detention center, Bai Jiaqi, at 2:30 PM on the 28th, the prisoner was still sitting in his room eating, and a guard spoke with him. Unexpectedly, five minutes later, he suddenly fainted. The guard immediately called the doctor to treat him. After examination by Director Chen of Shanghai Prison Hospital, it was diagnosed as a cerebral hemorrhage. An injection was given immediately, and the Japanese Liaison Department was notified to send Dr. Nakayama, a Japanese doctor from the Jinghu Hospital, to assist. After drawing blood and giving injections, his condition stabilized slightly, and he was moved to the ward on the second floor of the prison hospital. Fearing inadequate care, his subordinates Guan Xiansilang, Shibahara Heizaburo, and Nagamura Mitsugu were assigned to accompany and care for him. Dr. Nakayama said that because of excessive bleeding, it would be difficult to save his life, but he would do his best. At 6:50 PM, his condition worsened, and he began to gasp for breath, finally dying at 7:15 PM. He died lying on his back, dressed in military uniform, with his hands crossed on his chest, covered with a floral blanket. This general, who was once powerful and imposing, has now died miserably in prison, which is something that warmongers could not have anticipated.

[Another report] Yesterday afternoon, the District Attorney's Office sent Prosecutor Cao Hong to examine the body.

### Hiding the Assets of Traitor Liang Hongzhi: An Antique Fan from the Qianlong Era; A Leader of the Zhongjiu Army, Chen Mo, Involved in Embezzlement During the Takeover; High Court Prosecutor's Office Initiates Prosecution

[Report from our newspaper] After the victory, the takeover work across the country was filled with corruption and irregularities. Although there was an organization for cleaning up takeover teams, they were often powerless due to various reasons and had little effect. Unexpectedly, Chen Mo, the former leader of the Vanguard Corps of the Zhongyi Salvation Army, occupied an antique fan from the Qianlong era belonging to the traitor Liang Hongzhi. He was reported by the Shanghai Office of the Sino-American Cooperative Organization of the Military Commission. After the investigation by the High Court Prosecutor's Office of this city was concluded, he was prosecuted for the crime of hiding traitorous assets. The High Court will hold a trial in the coming days. This is also a "wonderful story" in the history of the takeover.

Chen is 33 years old, from Fengxian County. He was ordered to come to Shanghai after the victory and was also a prominent figure for a time. According to the prosecutor's indictment, on August 20 last year, when Liang Hongzhi went to Beijing to handle the handover, Chen took and hid an antique fan from the Qianlong era, occupying it for himself. He was reported by the Shanghai Office of the Sino-American Cooperative Organization of the Military Commission, and the fan was found in the defendant Chen Mo's home. Liang Hongzhi also testified to this fact on file. Chen claimed that the fan was purchased in Chengdu, which was obviously a deceptive excuse and should not be believed. His actions constitute the crime under Article 12 of the "Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors and Collaborators," and a public prosecution is specially initiated.

### A White Russian Accused of Collaborating with the Enemy to be Sentenced on the 6th of Next Month

The case of White Russian Shakosky Palkov, accused of collaborating with the enemy by his brother, was heard by the High Court yesterday. The defendant is 47 years old and has lived in this city for many years. During the occupation of Shanghai, he rented the house at 135 Yanqing Road to the enemy to open the Shanghai Chemical and Mineralogical Experiment Institute, which manufactured cobalt oxide for the enemy army. During the trial yesterday, the defendant argued that renting the house to the enemy was unavoidable under the circumstances at the time and that the house was only used as a business office. After the lawyer's defense, the court declared the case closed and set the sentencing date for December 6. The case of Bai Guozhen, the chief of the former Nanqu Police Sub-bureau, was also concluded at the same time, and the sentencing date was also set for December 6.

### Zongyi and Others Interrogated Yesterday

[Another report] Long Zongyi, who served as the captain of the former Pudong Self-Defense Corps and the adjutant of the former Police Brigade, was initially tried by the High Court yesterday. The defendant was charged with colluding with the deceased former commander of the corps, Xu Hongfa, to persecute patriotic comrades and extort villagers during his term in the former position. During the trial yesterday, the defendant admitted that he held the former position but vehemently denied that he had persecuted comrades or extorted money. In addition, Dong Zhongming, the former head of Ziteng Township in Minhang Town, was previously sentenced to two and a half years in prison by the High Court. The defendant was dissatisfied and, with the approval of the Supreme Court, the case was sent back for retrial. During the retrial by the High Court yesterday, the defendant explained the situation and the forced circumstances when he served as the former head of the township. The hearing was adjourned for further questioning.

### Qian Da to be Tried Today

### Scattered Items from Traitorous Assets to be Sorted and Sold First

Same Treatment for the Assets of Chuan Jinkui

The Adversary Property Disposal Committee of the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau passed a resolution today to seize the scattered items of traitorous property and concentrate them for sorting and sale first, while retaining the proceeds pending a court decision for separate disposal. In addition, it was resolved that Chuan Jinkui, the owner of Huaxing Steel Factory, assisted the enemy business Maruka Yoko during the occupation by manufacturing track tie plates for the Ministry of Railways, which aided the enemy. In addition to the enemy property portion of the factory being confiscated, the traitorous portion should also be taken into custody, and Chuan Jinkui's crimes will be transferred to the Shanghai High Court Prosecutor's Office for investigation.

### "To Take Something, You Must First Give Something": A Well-Dressed Young Man Cheats in a City Councilor's Home

[Report from our newspaper] Recently, a new type of fraud has been discovered in this city. On the morning of the day before yesterday, at around 10:00 AM, a young man in a Western suit came to 4 Lane 326 Fudian Middle Road and claimed that he had borrowed 200,000 yuan from the owner of the house, Gao Shu'an (the current city councilor), and had come to repay it. The family members informed him that the owner was out. The young man immediately made a phone call in the house, indicating that he had contacted Gao. He then took out a check for 250,000 yuan from the Nanjing Commercial Bank Shanghai Branch and asked for 50,000 yuan in cash as change. Seeing that he was well-dressed and dignified, the family members did not suspect anything else and paid him the money. It was not until Mr. Gao returned home that he realized he had been cheated.

### Seeking to Resolve Current Difficulties: Tea Merchants Discuss Redeeming Pledged Tea Leaves; Tea Merchant Representatives Visited Lin Fengbao Yesterday

Shou Jingwei, Sun Xiaocun, and Tang Jisan, prominent tea merchants in this city, and Chen Shoubai, Huang Yantang, Hong Chunzhi, and other representatives from tea-producing areas in Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces in Shanghai, visited Lin Fengbao, the Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, at 11:00 AM yesterday to seek ways to resolve the current difficulties in the tea industry and conduct preliminary discussions. The conversation lasted for about an hour. They first discussed the principles of redeeming pledged tea leaves and then the methods of the procurement principles, which were very satisfactory. It is expected that the decision on the redemption method will be made before the procurement is implemented. This issue will be raised at the meeting of the Lending Subcommittee of the Four-Bank Joint Office at 3:00 PM this afternoon, presided over by Director Lin. If a resolution is passed, it will be submitted to the Joint Office for review. It is learned that the procurement of tea leaves nationwide this year is estimated to be about 30 billion yuan, with the output of Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces accounting for one-third, and the rest from Hunan, Hubei and Fujian provinces. As for the 85,000 cases of hand-packaged tea leaves in Zhejiang and Anhui, Pinghui tea accounts for 40,000 cases, Tunlu tea for 20,000 cases, and Qimen tea for over 10,000 cases. It is also learned that the government is very concerned about the tea issue. When Minister of Economic Affairs Bu Yunwu came to Shanghai last time, he discussed with Director Lin of the Central Bank the method of procuring this year's tea leaves. After negotiations between the Central Bank and the China Agricultural Corporation, the China Trust Bureau was to purchase Pinghui green tea, and the agreed price was close, but the negotiations were once suspended. From this, it can be seen that the central government has unanimously agreed that this year's export tea leaves should be purchased by the government and exported in a timely manner to compete for overseas markets. However, various tea merchants need to bear black market interest on the funds they have advanced, and the longer it is delayed, the higher the cost. They urgently hope that the authorities can implement the established policy by the end of the Gregorian calendar and purchase box tea from various places. Technical issues such as grading and evaluation will naturally be handled with the assistance of the Tea Trade Association and local representatives.

### Year-End Bonus Issue: Labor and Management Need Understanding

Recently, a few factory workers have requested year-end bonuses from their employers as the end of the year approaches. This reporter specially visited Zhao Banfu, the Director of the Labor Affairs Department of the Social Affairs Bureau. According to Zhao, the issue of year-end bonuses is a matter of sentiment and not suitable for law. There are no regulations regarding this. However, if the factory can provide year-end bonuses, it can facilitate labor-management coordination. However, the current industrial and commercial downturn this year is also a fact. In short, the issue of year-end bonuses requires understanding between labor and management.

### Lihua Workers Petition for Resumption of Work

Another report: Over eighty workers from the Lihua Knitting Factory on Yuanle Road marched in a line with small flags in hand to the Social Affairs Bureau at 3:00 PM yesterday to petition, requesting the factory to resume work. According to the workers' representative, the factory's electricity was suddenly cut off on the 27th. On the 28th, the factory dismissed all workers due to the lack of electricity supply. Therefore, they are requesting the authorities to order the factory to resume work in order to sustain their livelihood. The Social Affairs Bureau instructed Wu to submit a written statement so that mediation could be carried out.

### Nazi War Crimes Trial: to Conclude Before Christmas

The trial of Nazi war criminals, which will last for three months, has been progressing very actively in recent days. The verbal battles between the two sides are fierce. Nearly twenty witnesses have testified, and there are still fifteen witnesses scheduled to appear to give favorable testimony for the twenty-one Hitler followers. The trial period is expected to last for another two weeks. After the trial is over and the lawyers on both sides have argued, the court can pronounce the verdict. Regardless of whether they are guilty or not, after the trial is completed, if the British and Chinese sides do not conduct trials, the US military may deport them back to Germany for disposal. The reporter visited Major Duar, the prosecutor in the Oertle case, yesterday. According to him, although six of the twenty-seven Nazi war criminals were acquitted, they are still detained in Tilanqiao Prison. The remaining twenty-one are still on trial. The US military hopes to complete the case as soon as possible. In any case, it can be concluded before Christmas. Legally speaking, the Allied forces are punishing criminals in this war crimes trial, but one of the most important points is to make the aggressors aware of their mistakes and to establish a new set of rules for the international community to provide a standard for future generations. This can be called the first attempt in history, and militarists should take heed. After completing this case, Major Duar will go to Tokyo to serve as General MacArthur's legal advisor, appointed by General MacArthur, and is expected to depart at the end of December.

### The China Tobacco Factory: Work Stoppage This Morning

All employees of the Ministry of Economic Affairs' China Tobacco Factory suddenly went on strike this morning. Upon receiving the news, the Social Affairs Bureau summoned all directors and supervisors of the factory's labor union for discussions. It is reported that the factory workers have raised three demands: (1) Year-end bonuses for male workers should be five months' salary plus one month's double pay; female workers should receive one month's salary based on a base salary of 200 yuan, plus one month's double pay. (2) Change from a daily wage system to a monthly salary system. (3) Future new hires should require the consent of the labor union. The Social Affairs Bureau has stated that the unauthorized strike is not in accordance with legal procedures and instructed the directors and supervisors to persuade workers to resume work within 24 hours. Any requests must be made in accordance with legal procedures.

### Calligrapher and Painter Sha Qi Returns from Belgium

Painter Sha Ning, also known as [omitted], is from Yin County, Zhejiang Province. In the spring of 1936, he went to Belgium to study at his own expense, introduced by his mentor Xu Beihong. He entered the National Royal Academy of Art and became a student of the great painter Bosfvecht. He graduated in 1939. His paintings, sculptures, and sketches all won first prizes. The [Belgian] Minister of [Education] personally awarded him the "Supreme Artistic Gold Medal," a rare honor, surprising and attracting the attention of the Belgian art world.

After graduation, he supported himself through painting and continued his studies in Belgium for another seven years, achieving greater proficiency and reputation, and joining the ranks of famous Western European painters. He has held several exhibitions at the Fiftieth Anniversary Museum of Belgium and the Bidet Gallery, among other places. Local newspapers have given enthusiastic reviews. In 1942, during an exhibition at the Bidet Gallery, his masterpiece "Girl Playing the Flute" was purchased and collected by Queen Elisabeth of Belgium, known for her enthusiasm for cultural endeavors. He also participated in the 1940 Atria Exhibition in Brussels and the 1945 exhibition organized by Tigani, the president of the Belgian Academy of Art. Participants in these two exhibitions were all first-class painters from Europe or residing in Europe, both living and deceased. Sha Jun had masterpieces included in both, which received favorable comments.

Sha Jun is full of patriotism. After the fall of Brussels, the German propaganda only knew about "Manchukuo," hardly knowing about China. After the restoration, when the art world in Belgium held an exhibition to celebrate, the flags of the victorious nations were hung, but there was no Chinese flag. Sha Jun immediately painted one and sent it to the Brussels Evening News for publication. Last year, the Chinese Embassy in Belgium and overseas Chinese presented President Chiang [Kai-shek] with a [portrait], also by Sha Jun.

Sha Jun has stayed in Belgium for ten years and has recently returned to Shanghai. It is reported that he has been hired by the National Beiping Art School as a professor. (The picture is a recent photo of Sha.)

### Children's Health and Welfare Institute Offers Free Medical Care to Sick Children

The Taicang Municipal Children's Health and Welfare Institute, in order to promote children's health and widely benefit the children of Taicang, has established a joint free day and night clinic at its main hospital at No. 10, Lane 173, East Baoxing Road, North Sichuan Road, in accordance with the provisions of its organizational regulations.

The institute's fundraising campaign has been extended to December 5th.

### Reader Consultation: Medicine and Health

(1) Schistosomiasis

A friend from Pudong, Mr. [omitted], had a blood test that showed an increase in eosinophils. It is said that this may be caused by Japanese schistosomiasis parasites in the body. I have several questions and would appreciate it if you could answer them in the medical consultant column of your newspaper: (1) Can an increase in eosinophils determine that there is indeed schistosomiasis parasitism in the body? Can other diseases also cause an increase in eosinophils? (2) What method can be used to determine that one is indeed suffering from schistosomiasis? (3) How long is the incubation period for this disease? What are the symptoms during the incubation period? (4) What are the consequences if this disease is not treated? (5) How does schistosomiasis enter the human body? (6) If one is sure that one has this disease, is "Shiniyi [omitted] Antimony" effective? Can people without the disease be injected with it?

[Answer by Dr. Gu Yuqi, Doctor of Medicine] (1) An increase in eosinophils in the white blood cell classification does not necessarily mean that there are Japanese schistosomiasis parasites in the body. According to pathology, there are the following possible diseases that can cause an increase in eosinophils: various parasites in the intestines (such as roundworms), bronchial asthma, malaria, and Japanese schistosomiasis, etc. (2) Examination of stool and detailed medical history, followed by a detailed examination of the whole body. (3) The incubation period of this disease is very long. Two to three weeks after the human body is infected with this parasite, one feels tired, has an abnormal appetite, and a slight fever. Sometimes, swelling of the liver and spleen can be found. Four to five weeks after infection, when the female worms begin to lay eggs, there is initially a slight fever, followed by chills and high fever, either remittent or intermittent, sometimes lasting for several days or even ten days. After several days, there is a specific tenesmus and mucus in the stool, which contains a large number of eggs. Therefore, many eggs can be seen by examining the stool. (4) If this disease is not treated, the liver will develop cirrhosis, the intestinal mucosa will atrophy and necrose, and the portal system will have congestion, digestive disorders, ascites, and congestive splenomegaly, eventually leading to malnutrition or excessive ascites, and then to systemic weakness and death. (5) Schistosomiasis is transmitted through the skin, not through the mouth. If the skin of humans or mammals comes into contact with the intermediate host of schistosomiasis (a small snail) and the developing Cercaria for a period of time, it will be invaded and infected. (6) If one is sure that one has this disease, Neostibosau can be used. People without the disease should not be injected with it.

(2) Nosebleeds

Huang Xiong asks: I have had nosebleeds since I was a child. They come and go. Sometimes there is a lot of bleeding. After stopping the bleeding, it comes out of my mouth again. I recently had an X-ray, which said that my lungs were normal, but my trachea had a slight problem. I would like to ask: (1) What is the cause of this disease? How should it be treated? (2) My lungs are normal, but I have a small amount of phlegm (without coughing). Why? What is the treatment? (3) I have trachoma. What is the best treatment? (4) What are the harms of having a long foreskin? How should it be treated?

[Answer by Dr. Gu Yuqi, Doctor of Medicine] (1) The nosebleeds are probably caused by chronic rhinitis or vitamin C deficiency. A detailed examination is needed to determine the cause. (2) Whether there is a problem with the lungs can be diagnosed with an X-ray. If there is no lung disease but there is phlegm, it is probably chronic tracheobronchitis. (3) Whether you have trachoma should be diagnosed by an ophthalmologist. (4) A long foreskin can easily lead to nocturnal emission. Surgery can be performed at any municipal hospital.

### Emergency Relief Recipients: Impoverished Woman in Difficult Labor, Young Child Scalded

### Cooking Oil Prices Fall into Negotiated Pricing; Manufacturers Willing to Sell at Lower Prices; Mayor Satisfied with the Distribution Situation in Jiangwan

[Our Newspaper Report] Cooking oil prices have been falling for days. Yesterday, hoarders released even larger quantities from their warehouses, offering rapeseed and sesame cooking oils, totaling about 2,000 dan [unit of weight]. The market price subsequently collapsed. Rapeseed oil was 135,000 yuan, and soybean oil was 130,000 yuan, falling greatly into negotiated pricing. Cooking oil allocated by the Joint Distribution Office was rarely inquired about. Oil pressing factories believe that production is increasing daily, but sales channels are narrowing daily, resulting in increasing inventory that not only ties up capital but also incurs interest expenses. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, a meeting was convened at the Oil Factory Association to discuss coping measures. Xie Yuxiang of Dayouyu, Xue Chengzhang of Weimin, and Zhang Chao of the Joint Distribution Office were selected to meet with Section Chief Ji Mingqi of the Food Department of the Social Affairs Bureau to provide input: It is hoped that the Social Affairs Bureau will allow the oil factories to adjust allocation prices according to the market within negotiated pricing, so that the negotiated price allocation will not be unsalable when the market price is lower than the negotiated price. The Social Affairs Bureau expressed great satisfaction with the factories' voluntary offer to lower cooking oil allocation prices according to market prices and readily approved it. This measure can be implemented starting today. Therefore, it is expected that today's cooking oil allocation price will be lower than the negotiated price.

Furthermore, all of the more than 1,400 registered retailers at the Joint Distribution Office have been fully allocated. The second allocation will begin today. Starting next week, the office will allocate based on the actual retail sales volume of each retail store to reflect the actual situation. It is also reported that Mayor Wu inspected several cooking oil retail stores in Jiangwan a few days ago. He inquired in detail about the source, price, and retail price of the allocated cooking oil. As a result, he believed that the office's handling of the oil allocation procedures was in accordance with regulations and achieved remarkable results.

### US Dollar Reaches 4,900; Gold Breaks Through 2.7 Million

Gold prices still rebounded yesterday, mainly due to tight supply and strong actual sales. The opening price in the morning was 2,658,000. Sellers with financial needs sold, and buying interest was weaker, causing prices to fall. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 50 bars at a price of 2,640,000. Afterwards, demand increased on dips, and prices gradually rebounded from within 2,640,000. Buying interest rose again, and supply decreased. Near noon, prices rebounded to around 2,685,000 before leveling off slightly. At noon, prices hovered around 2,680,000. In the afternoon, those with next-day settlement bought without selling, breaking through the 2.7 million mark and closing at a high price, up 48,000 from the previous close. Gold ornaments were priced as high as 288,400. Silver ingots and silver dollars were flat, and the black market discount remained at around 15%.

Foreign currencies were slightly more active yesterday. The retail market price for the US dollar was still 3,500 yuan to 3,530 yuan. The black market opening price in the morning was 4,750 yuan to 4,800 yuan, rebounding to above 4,850 yuan mid-day, slightly falling back at noon. After being driven up by the gold market in the afternoon, it also passively rose to close at 4,900 yuan, up more than 100 yuan from the previous close. Hong Kong dollars had limited transactions and remained relatively stable. The Hong Kong exchange rate rose from 930 yuan to 940 yuan with buying interest. The Indian exchange rate was around 1,140 yuan, and the British exchange rate was 15,100 yuan with supply, but transactions were limited. The US exchange rate remained unchanged.

### Rice Prices Slightly Rise; Soybean Oil Recovers Slightly by 1,000-2,000

Yesterday, the total rice supply to the northern and southern rice markets was more than 10,000 shi [unit of volume]. Retail sales by shops were relatively strong. Southern japonica rice rose by more than 1,000 yuan, and northern japonica rice also rose by 1,000 yuan. Indica rice was quite popular. White glutinous rice arrivals and sales were both sluggish and still scarce [omitted]. Soybean sales were sluggish, still hovering weakly, and continued to recover slightly by 300-500 yuan. Soybean cake sales were average, and prices were mediocre. Flour prices were temporarily fixed. Flour sales were stagnant. Broad beans were as before. Sesame from Guangdong continued to arrive, and the market was quite strong. Raw peanuts were selectively purchased on the street, with high prices for good quality and stagnant prices for poor quality. Fava beans rose slightly by 200-300 yuan. Mung beans continued to be handled in Southeast Asia, and the market trend was stable. Corn was stable. The supply and demand of the oil market remained stable. Soybean oil recovered slightly by 1,000-2,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil was flat, and vegetable oil was also [omitted]. Rapeseed and sesame oil were flat. Goods from Hankou, Bengbu, and Northeast China continued to arrive, and oil prices were temporarily trending towards stability.

### North Africa Needs Chinese Tea; Obstructed by Undetermined Exchange Rate

[Our Newspaper Report] According to tea industry representatives, Europeans and Americans place great importance on tea, a daily necessity, especially in French Africa, where its importance is almost like rice for us. They have relied on China for supply for years. However, after the end of the war, transactions have failed to revive for various reasons. The main reason is that the exchange rate has not been officially determined. For example, recently, they planned to telegraphically transfer a huge sum of francs to various banks in Shanghai, but due to the aforementioned reasons, there was no recipient for a while. Observing the current situation, at a time when the Chinese tea crisis is becoming increasingly serious, it is hoped that the government will provide timely solutions.

In the foreign tea market, sellers continued to actively sell. Although there is still demand for Chinese tea abroad, the prices offered are harsh. Therefore, exporters are unwilling to actively purchase, and transactions remain weak. Domestic sales of red and green tea show no signs of improvement, and the process is quiet and bleak.

### Japanese and Indian Yarn Arrive in Hong Kong; Prices Cheaper Than Shanghai Market

[Hong Kong, 29th] Five million pounds of Japanese yarn, approved for export by the General Headquarters of the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers in Japan, have arrived in Hong Kong. A large quantity of Indian cotton yarn has also arrived. It is reported that Indian cotton yarn will be dumped in South China at prices far cheaper than those in the Shanghai market and is also trending towards export to various ports in Southeast Asia.

### Factories with Less Than Three Months of Cotton Inventory Will Be Approved for Foreign Exchange Purchases; National Factory Cotton Consumption Will Reach 9 Million Dan Next Year

[Our Newspaper Report] According to textile experts, the number of spindles in operation in our country is currently only about 2.5 million. Starting next year, as the spindles in Northeast China are gradually repaired and put into operation, it is expected that this number will gradually increase to 3 million or 3.5 million spindles. Ordinary coarse yarn spinning requires 3 dan to 3.5 dan of raw cotton per spindle per year, while fine yarn spindles require about 2.5 dan. Assuming an average of 3 dan per spindle, and with 3 million spindles as the national standard, it is estimated that the raw cotton required for spinning in our country next year will be about 9 million dan. However, in reality, the spindles in each factory cannot operate all year round, and there are often shutdowns or lack of power in each factory. Therefore, this amount of cotton consumption still needs to be discounted accordingly. It is now heard that the authorities will approve foreign exchange purchases of American cotton for factories with less than three months' worth of cotton inventory. At the same time, they must purchase domestic cotton in a certain proportion to promote it. However, since the Sixth District Yarn Factory Association began registering the cotton inventory of its member factories, only more than 70 have reported so far. It is hoped that those factories that have not yet reported will fill out the forms as soon as possible to facilitate the process.

### Dragon Head Cloth Nears 100,000

Cloth sales in various places are still strong, mainly because the number of Textile Reconstruction [cloths] for sale is limited, resulting in a tightening of [available cloths] on the market. The prices of various cloths have reached new highs. Dragon Head fine cloth is about to break the 100,000 mark. Because dyeing and weaving factories expect strong sales of dark-colored cloths and are unwilling to sell, dark-colored Shilin [cloth] has risen by another 3,000 yuan. Fine cloth and Four Gentlemen drill [cloths] have also risen by 2,000 yuan to 2,500 yuan. Jinbang Le'an an blue cloth has suddenly risen by more than 10,000. Inventory is depleted, and the prices of all cloths are rising.

### Current Production of the British Spinning Industry

[Reuters, London, 28th] Lancashire needs to produce 1.82 billion pounds of yarn annually to meet the national economic plan and achieve the goal of increasing exports by 75% compared to 1938. In the five-month period from April to August of this year, production was 730 million pounds per year. After meeting domestic demand of 700 million pounds, there is a surplus of 30 million pounds for export. The industry is confident that it can make up for this shortfall, but various obstacles, such as outdated machinery, uneconomical operations, and lack of raw materials, must be overcome.

### Trade with the Soviet Union Difficult to Develop; Due to Low Prices Offered by the Soviet Side

[Our Newspaper Report] Sino-Soviet trade is currently being promoted gradually. It is heard that the biggest difficulty is that the Soviet Union is offering too low prices. For example, the Soviet Commercial Representative in China has contacted several times to ship our country's brick tea. In the end, the deal could not be concluded because the price offered was too low. As for goods such as tung oil, raw silk, and hog bristles exported to the Soviet Union in recent years, they are used to offset our country's past debts to the Soviet Union. This work was originally undertaken by the Fuxing Company. Since 1939, it has been undertaken by the Central Trust Bureau. Each year, valuables worth approximately US$11 million are shipped to the Soviet Union to pay off the debt. It is estimated that it will not be fully paid off until 1952.

### 5,000 Boxes of Tea Shipped to Europe Yesterday

[Our Newspaper Report] A large shipment of tea was sent to Europe. The Songdan, the first French postal ship to return to Shanghai, left Shanghai yesterday for France, carrying more than 5,000 boxes of tea. This is a new record for the amount of tea exported from the Sino-European route after the victory, but it is still very small compared to before the war. In addition, the Haiyong ship sailed to Tianjin with 2,150 bales of cotton, which were reported by the China Textile Corporation. There were also 100 tons of medicines, which were the goods of the Peking Union Medical College Hospital, transported to Tianjin for transshipment to Peking.

### Overproduction of Flour; Allotment Sales Insufficient; Manufacturers Apply for Purchases or Export Permits

[Our Newspaper Report] Since resuming production, the five major flour mills in this city, including Fufeng, Fuxin, Huaying, Yutong, and Maoxin, have been providing 12,000 bags of flour daily for allocation and sale at negotiated prices. However, recently, due to sluggish flour prices, only a few thousand bags of allocated flour are picked up each day. However, the normal production volume of the five factories is about 80,000 bags per day. If they only produce flour for allocation and sale, operating for five days a month is enough to meet the city's allocation needs for one month. However, under the current circumstances, even the production volume for these five days cannot be fully allocated. Therefore, there is no way to sell the extra production volume. The factories are all feeling the burden of tied-up capital and wasted interest expenses. As a result, they have no choice but to stop production. However, the workers' wages are still calculated on a monthly basis. It is now heard that the factories are applying to the municipal government to have the surplus flour purchased by the Food Department, or to allow them to export it, or to dispose of it in other reasonable ways, in order to alleviate the flour factories' difficulties.

### Central Trust Bureau Allocates Artificial Silk to Both Local and Out-of-Town Applicants

### 42-Count Yarn Reaches 5.2 Million; Next Month's Yarn Allocation Schedule Has Been Set; Payment Deadline to Be Determined by Each Factory and the Re-Allocation Committee

[Our Newspaper Report] Yesterday, the yarn market saw a further surge. Inland buyers, eager for spot goods, were willing to pay high prices to purchase. Sellers were unwilling to sell rashly and insisted on a high price. As a result, 20-count yarn continued to rise by 40,000-50,000. Fine yarn was particularly outstanding. Although Silver Moon 32-count was priced at 3.05 million, Blue Phoenix once rose as high as 3.25 million, but it was not easy to obtain. 42-count Police Line rose again to 5.2 million, but it was already at the end of its run. Buyers were scarce, and many were retreating in the face of difficulties.

[Our Newspaper Report] The dates for the four allocations of cotton yarn jointly distributed by national and private factories in this city for December have been set as the 2nd, 9th, 17th, and 25th. The payment deadline for each allocation will be determined by the factories distributing cotton yarn and the expanded distribution meeting of the Re-Allocation Committee. Factories in the Re-Allocation Committee that are unable to receive the allocated yarn after payment can deduct interest on a daily basis. In addition, the allocation of 1,500 pieces of yarn for other retailers will also be distributed in four allocations according to the above dates.

### Hoarders Drive Up Silk Prices; China Silk Corporation Releases 70 Dan

The silk market, which had been quiet for a long time, suddenly surged this week. Since the beginning of the week, 20/22 denier Grade D raw silk has risen from 3.4 million yuan per dan to beyond the 4 million yuan mark. However, market conditions abroad have been trending downwards. This abnormal market trend is clearly due to hoarders deliberately driving up prices. Just as silk weaving industry loans were about to be disbursed, the raw materials stored by the silk weaving factories were insufficient. Therefore, after obtaining the loans, the factories had to absorb as much as possible for use. This led to general raw silk hoarders believing that there was an opportunity to take advantage of and raise prices. On the previous day, the China Silk Corporation purchased and transferred 70 dan of D-grade 20/22 denier raw silk, which it had acquired on behalf of the Central Trust Bureau, to various silk factories for a price of 3.95 million yuan in national currency. Since this batch was released for sale, general hoarders have gradually become less conspicuous. Yesterday, prices gradually returned to normal, with D-grade raw silk opening at 3.8 million yuan per dan. Chengfeng Silk Weaving Factory in this city ordered 15 dan of special coarse 40/42 denier Grade D raw silk from Yongtai Silk Factory for a price of 4.05 million yuan in national currency.

### More Than 30 Loans Approved by the Four Joint Banks

The Four Joint Banks held a board meeting on the afternoon of the 28th and approved more than 30 cases, including the national banks undertaking rediscounting or re-mortgaging for legally reorganized provincial banks, and loans for the Zibo area industrial and mining industry in Shandong Province and the cotton import financing for the Yunnan Textile Factory. It also approved the establishment of the Guangdong-Guangxi Region [omitted] Loan Consortium. The committee approved 2.7 billion yuan in production loans and 6.3 billion yuan in transportation and sales loans, totaling 9 billion yuan. These would be handled in accordance with the precedent set by the Shanghai and Chongqing Region Banking Consortiums.

### Licenses of Enemy and Puppet Companies Must Be Reissued by the End of the Year

Regulations were previously issued for the registration of various companies in the recovered areas. Companies that had a business license during the period of enemy and puppet occupation, and whose licenses were stamped or marked with other characters by the enemy or puppet regime, could have their licenses reissued by the competent local authorities after submitting them to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval. The original deadline for this reissue procedure was the end of June of this year, but it has now been extended to the end of this year. It has been decided that there will be no further extensions after this.

### Industrial Raw Materials Must Be Protected from a Flood of Arrivals

The raw material market is like a speculative scene. Once someone inquires about raw materials with thin inventories, prices immediately rise sharply. The prices of three acids (sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, and nitric acid) have risen two to three times. Baking soda and soda ash have also risen sharply. The price of carbolic acid was more than 300 yuan per pound a month ago. Although it gradually increased afterwards, it was at most 500-600 yuan. Now it has suddenly risen to 4,400 yuan per pound. Zinc powder was previously sold at low prices due to the abundance of goods on the market, but recently it has also become scarce and expensive. Although high prices are offered for goods that have risen, it is impossible to find them anywhere. As a result, raw material merchants who were on the verge of collapse have suddenly become active. However, according to industry insiders, after a large number of American raw materials were imported in March of this year, raw material prices have remained stagnant until now. It is expected that more foreign ships will arrive in December, and the imported raw materials will be more than in March. Therefore, the high profits of raw material merchants may not be sustainable.

### Bank Lending for Arbitrage; Securities in a State of Flux

The official rate declined slightly yesterday. The consolidated "C" (統丙) opened in the morning at $1420. Major players in the industry, such as Chen Teh (誠德), recognizing unfavorable conditions in the securities lending market, sold off shares, causing the price to fall below $1310 before stabilizing. It struggled to stay above $1350 at the close, mainly because miscellaneous brands were still being bought up by Room 604, maintaining a sense of stability. Cotton futures (紡果) closed down by $80 for each of Grades A, B, and C compared to the previous close. The consolidated "D" (統丁) dropped a small $70, and the consolidated "E" (統戊) fell by $50. The total transaction volume was approximately $5 million.

Chinese stocks initially fell but then recovered yesterday, with banks engaging in arbitrage activities, providing supply in the spot market. There was a large influx of bank funds for absorption, making it impossible for short sellers to operate. Around noon, there was a scramble to cover positions, causing the price to rise. The morning opened steady, and short sellers attempted to exert pressure, selling Nos. 89 and 36, which led to new lows. However, arbitrage activities by No. 207 helped maintain the price. Nos. 4, 176, 231, 142, and 38 successively covered their positions, gradually pushing the price higher. Around 10:30 AM, persistent pressure in the spot market, with Nos. 229, 152, and 169 selling, revealed weakness. At this point, the spot and futures prices differed by as much as $10, and New Asia Transportation (新業交通) engaged in low-interest arbitrage. As a result, the pressure in the spot market was absorbed, and confidence gradually stabilized, leading to a gradual rise. Nos. 232, 177, and 109 bought in, while Nos. 180, 89, and 149 cautiously covered their short positions, further driving the price upward. The market became more firm near noon. As a result, popular stocks like Wing On Spinning (永紗), Sincere Co. (信和), and New Kwong (新光) each rose by half a percent compared to the previous close. King Fook (景福), China United (勤興), and Wah Fung (華豐) saw slight gains, while Mayer & Co. (美亞) increased by about ten percent. Among the less popular stocks, China Textile (中紡), Rong (榮), Tung Yih (統益), China Silk (中絲), and Five Harmony (五和) all experienced slight declines. The rest rose by about half a percent. In deferred delivery, Wing On Spinning, Mayer & Co., and China United each rose by half a percent, Sincere Co. was slightly stronger by half a percent, King Fook remained flat, and New Kwong and Wah Fung saw slight gains. In the afternoon, new buying suddenly quieted down, creating a wavering situation with inadequate support. Although sellers were few, sentiment remained uncertain. Canton brokers, such as No. 184, sold, which easily caused declines, but No. 173 and others absorbed at lower prices, providing support. There was a slight upward movement near the close. As a result, Wing On Spinning and New Kwong rose slightly compared to the previous close, Mayer & Co., Sincere Co., and Wah Fung each rose by slightly less than half a percent, King Fook remained flat, and China United declined slightly. Among the less popular stocks, Wing On Public (永公) rose by slightly less than ten percent, cement fell by ten percent, and the rest saw mixed ups and downs. Outside the market, various stocks saw slight increases.

Foreign stocks saw stability in Ewo Brewery (怡啤), Jardine Matheson (業廣), and Shanghai Land Investment (尙形), while the rest were unable to sustain due to excessive sales after being held for a long time. As a result, Jardine Matheson remained flat compared to the previous close, Ewo Brewery rose slightly, Shanghai Cotton fell by half a percent, and the rest saw slight declines.

There are three matches in the A, B, and C groups of the second Football League today, which will be held at Yiyuan and Zhongzheng Park stadiums. The Group A match is Qingbai vs. the Jewish team, which will be played at Yiyuan Stadium. Tickets are divided into two types: 2,000 yuan and 5,000 yuan. Qingbai has been practicing diligently since being defeated by Donghua last week, trying to regain its reputation. However, A Que has been penalized for leaving the field once, and Li Yichen's Taishi card injured his foot. In addition, since Sa Li left Shanghai, they will not be able to play, which is regrettable. Today's lineup includes Qin Bigao as goalkeeper, Wu Zhongyan as defender, Meng Yigao as center back, Ka Zhu Yongfu and Xu Guofu as midfielders, and the forwards are Xue Weitai, Gao Baozheng, Luo Fufu, and Zhang Renyi, with Song Lingsheng as the captain, which is a well-organized team. The Jewish football team is known as a dark horse and often has unpredictable performances. Today, Qingbai must work hard when facing the powerful Jewish team.

According to a notice from the Football Committee, tomorrow's matches between the Railway and Xuhui in the B3 group and Youlian and Haiyan in the C3 group will be delayed due to other uses of the stadium. Therefore, the first B3 group match will be delayed to 1:20 PM, and the C3 group match will be postponed to 3:10 PM. Today's schedule is as follows:

Qingbai—Jewish (Group A) 2:30 PM Yiyuan

Qunli—Pan Team (B2) 2:30 PM Zhongyi

### Black and White Loses Again; Haiqing Wins Slightly

Renyu Wins Over McLins in Another Match

The second act of the charity basketball game was held at the City Gymnasium starting at 6:00 PM last night. There were two matches in succession, Renyu vs. Helena, Black and White Men vs. US Navy. Due to the extremely cold weather last night, there were very few spectators. The number of tickets sold was 60 for the 3,000 yuan tickets upstairs and 48 for the 5,000 yuan tickets downstairs, totaling 420,000 yuan, which was allocated to charity expenses. As a result of the competition, Renyu defeated Helena 58-43, and Black and White Men lost to the US Navy Youth Association team 45-49.

### 仁餘勝海倫那

In the first match, Renyu versus Helena, Wu Xin of Renyu shot into the basket to open the scoring. Helena's player Vieira immediately retaliated. Yao Wenlu also scored. Wu Xin was effective on both sides of the court. In the first quarter, Renyu led with 15 to 11. At the end of the first half, Renyu led again with 29 to 23. In the third quarter, Renyu replaced Xu Zhongyi and Yao Wenyi with Shen Pengju and Wang Yunsheng. Helena seemed to improve, but it was short-lived. Renyu led with 41 to 27, maintaining an effective lead. At the final buzzer, Renyu defeated the U.S. Navy's Helena with a score of 58 to 43.

In the final match, Black & White versus Haiqing, the whistle blew to start the game. Shi Ronglu and Capton both committed fouls and scored from free throws. The competition was fierce, with scores remaining close. At the end of the first quarter, the American team led with 10 to 7. In the second quarter, the American team was quite aggressive, but Black & White fought back bravely. At halftime, the score was tied at 18. In the third quarter, Haiqing scored frequently, adding seven points rapidly. Black & White relied solely on Lin Ziyi and Guo Guoye to score two points each, falling behind in the score. At the end of the third quarter, Black & White had 31 points, while the American team had 40. In the final quarter, Black & White suddenly showed vigor, fighting hard to score. Shen Renshou, Ye Kexi, and Li Jinzao continued to contribute, once closing the gap to 40 to 42, just one point behind. After an American timeout, Blot and Dealy each made a shot, adding four more points. Xu Zhen followed up with a basket. Dealy scored again as time ran out.

### A Record of the Demeanor of Over Twenty Representatives at the United Nations General Assembly

— New York Air Mail Dispatch, October 31st, Our Correspondent in the United States, Mao Shuqing

Twenty years ago, a political scientist once said: Diplomacy is an art, not a science. A successful diplomat does not rely on formulas in books, but on momentary wit and natural talent. At this United Nations General Assembly, I listened to speeches by more than twenty chief representatives. The most successful, in my opinion, was the Indian representative, Mrs. Pandit.

Mrs. Pandit's Speech Was the Most Successful

At the San Francisco Conference, Mrs. Pandit was not yet qualified to be a representative. She was an Indian citizen engaged in political activities throughout the United States to fight for India's freedom and independence. Now that India's autonomy has been initially achieved, this sister of Chairman Nehru, wearing a water-red Indian dress, is receiving unanimous support from the United Nations.

Mrs. Pandit has a "weather-beaten" face, graying hair, and a medium build. Her English is very clear in every syllable, although there is a bit of an Indian accent mixed in, it is not annoying to listen to. She reads from her prepared speech, and the ending of each paragraph is very light and concise. This is completely opposite to the American representative, Austin. Austin speaks like an actor, his voice is very sonorous, and the conclusion of each paragraph is very loud, often winning applause from the audience with his loud tone.

Austin's Speech Is Like Wind Sweeping Fallen Leaves

It is said that President Truman chose Austin to be the chief representative because he can "speak." He is one of the most inflammatory speakers in the Senate. His intonation is very distinct. When he reads his speech, sometimes it is like the wind sweeping fallen leaves, reading more than ten sentences in one breath. Sometimes, he pauses for more than ten seconds between each word. His voice is like a booming bell, unlike Varnas, whose voice is full of "sand," nor is it like Truman's, whose tone is weak. Many American listeners are disgusted by Austin's excessive "dramatics," but most Americans still find his speeches "enjoyable."

Sir Baggall Possesses a Gentlemanly Demeanor

The British representatives, who are the epitome of gentlemanly demeanor, also have their lovable aspects. They attend meetings diligently, never missing a session. When they attend, they listen attentively from beginning to end. Foreign Minister Bevin did not come, and Sir Baggall still represented the United Kingdom, and his demeanor was the same as it was during the London conference in January. When he read his speech, the content criticized the Soviet Union, but his face never looked towards the Soviet side. At this General Assembly, the seats of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union were all in the first row. The United Kingdom and the United States sat side by side on the left. The Soviet Union was in the middle of the first row, on the right. To the left of the Soviet seat was Uruguay, and to the right was Venezuela.

Every representative who finished speaking and left the stage had to pass in front of the seats of the United Kingdom and the United States. Sir Baggall would always stand up and shake hands warmly, to celebrate the success of the other party's speech (except for Molotov). Baggall shook hands warmly with Mrs. Pandit, and when he shook hands with Dr. Gu Weijun, there was an indescribable feeling of cordiality.

Dr. Gu Weijun's Words and Actions Are All Appropriate

In terms of speaking skills and demeanor, I think Dr. Gu Shaochuan's speech this time (October 28) was 100% successful. He stood up straight, and his walking, movements, and the use of his hands were all very appropriate. His English pronunciation was melodious and clear, and every sentence and every word was able to convey its meaning. What is especially commendable is that other representatives read their scripts from beginning to end, their faces not facing the audience. Although Gu Shaochuan also looked at the script, he memorized the first and last paragraphs. The beginning and the end are the keys to a successful speech. This is, in any case, the crystallization of decades of experience.

However, the speech of the Chinese representatives has no status in this entire conference. Why? Because what we say has no content. Apart from singing praises of "peace clichés," it is simply impossible to say a concrete word about China's internal and external situation today. I remember that in January of this year, when the first United Nations General Assembly was held in London, a reporter from The Times of London wrote: "Dr. Gu Weijun is eloquent, but his content is empty." This time, we are still making the same mistake. The New York Times and the New York Herald Tribune published the full text of Molotov's speech and Austin's speech in full pages. The speeches of Belarus and Mexico were also published in considerable detail. However, The New York Times used only two sentences to describe Gu Shaochuan's speech lightly. The New York Herald Tribune: "Next, the Chinese representative spoke, and there was nothing special to record in the content, but one thing was quite interesting, and that was that Dr. Gu Weijun reiterated the international control of nicotine" (note: nicotine in opium red pills, a kind of narcotic).

The South Representative's Speech Causes the Audience to Doze Off

What is the exact opposite of Gu Weijun's style is the South Slav chief representative Xue Mishu, this old man with a hunchback, wearing a black dress, standing and reading his French script for a full hour. The representatives, reporters, and audiences upstairs who were playing chess almost fell asleep. Many small countries in South America, such as Guatemala, Nicaragua, etc., have always been uninterested in meetings, and they have long since slipped away. People like Mrs. Roosevelt were reading newspapers (Mrs. Roosevelt flipped through the New York Post while Gu Weijun was speaking). Many reporter old masters were not interested in this old man from Yugoslavia. Some were chatting, some were playing chess, and some were drawing tic-tac-toe. Because I was drawing tic-tac-toe with an American reporter, I knocked over a chair in the reporter's seat, and the whole audience paid attention to it.

However, such an old man, such a lecture like a monk chanting scriptures, its content is very sharp and mean. His United Nations General Assembly reporter was more humorous. He said that he condemned Britain's behavior in Greece, advocated reserving the veto power, and also involved the issue of the US military stationing in China. Everyone realized this deeply when the translator translated it into English.

The New Zealand Representative Looks Like Hu Shi

A longer speech than the South Slav representative's was given by the old New Zealand diplomat, Brand St., who gave a speech of nineteen pages. His speech was full of scholarly demeanor, and he also looked somewhat like Hu Shi. This New Zealand representative started from the creation of the world, one thing at a time, and then analyzed the importance of peace and the unreasonableness of the "veto power" of the five major powers. He advocated abolishing the "veto power."

Unexpectedly, the veto power issue became the central theme of this conference. Secondly, it is the issue of foreign troops residing in the territory of non-enemy countries, and thirdly, it is the issue of Jews and Palestine. Among these three major issues, the first two are naked, and the last one is looming. The first two issues can be roared loudly, and people can be scolded with a flushed face. Everyone is unwilling to mention the latter issue clearly, and they all use "overtones" to express it. The opposition of the front two issues is simple. The latter issue is not only complicated, but will also immediately affect the US election on November 5.

The first person to expose the Jewish issue was Truman's opening remarks. He said that regardless of race, the United Nations should send anyone who is homeless back to their homeland. He also said: "I will do my best to get Congress to pass a bill to allow such people to immigrate to the United States." These were Truman's words to win votes for the Democratic Party on November 5th. Its effect on the internal affairs is greater than on the external affairs. Later, the representatives of the Islamic countries of Egypt, Iran, and Lebanon repeatedly mentioned the issue of sending "homeless" people back to their country. The Egyptian representative spoke very clearly. He said: "The repatriation of the homeless should be based on the principle of not causing disputes, especially not harming the interests of the original residents." Neither mentioned the word "Jew," but they had already "tacitly understood" in their hearts.

Two Talents in Egypt Do Not Mention Jewish Matters

The chief representative of Egypt at the General Assembly is Sir Haig, the Speaker of the Egyptian Senate, bald, wearing wide-rimmed tortoiseshell glasses. He speaks fluent French. He and Egyptian Ambassador to the United States, Sir Haisen, are the two major talents in Egypt. Sir Haisen speaks fluent English and is the Egyptian representative to the Security Council. According to internal staff of the Egyptian delegation, they do not want the General Assembly to discuss the Jewish issue. If someone raises it, Egypt will fight desperately to oppose the division of Palestine, especially to oppose Truman's unilateral pro-Jewish policy.

For the past thirty years, no US president has failed to show favoritism to the Jews. The Jews control American commerce, especially the American propaganda apparatus. Even Hitler was finally strangled by the Jews, let alone the head of government of a democratic country?

### Dongtai, An Ancient City on the Fan Gong Embankment, Returns to the Embrace of the Government

— Dongtai Dispatch, October 13th, Our Reporter in Taixian, Ling Songshou

Dongtai has been recovered. This ancient city on the Fan Gong Embankment has returned to the embrace of the government, bringing people infinite excitement, but also infinite emotion!

As a reporter in northern Jiangsu, every day I write drafts and articles; from the victory until now, for more than a year, it has almost always been terrible words such as "war," "casualties," etc.; or pitiful cries such as "returning home," "relief," etc.!

On the 25th, the National Army began to prepare for the deployment of operations against Dongtai. The 56th Regiment searched and advanced, encountering the strong resistance of the Communist Army's Special Service Regiment of the Central Jiangsu Military Region and the 5th Regiment of the Second Sub-district in the Chongjia She Lijia She area. The battle fluctuated intermittently. The 57th Regiment advanced from Hujia Dun, the last stronghold on the periphery of Dongtai! Near the Five Gods Temple, due to the solid fortifications of the Communist Army, there was fierce fighting all day long.

On the 26th, the battle continued. After dusk, the 189th Regiment captured Sanzao, approaching the east gate of Dongtai. The 56th Regiment also cleared all the Communist Army strongholds in the southeast of Dongtai, less than two Chinese miles from the city. The Five Gods Temple was still in a stalemate.

On the 27th, the great scene of recovering Dongtai took a sharp turn for the worse within a few hours in the morning. The 57th Regiment faced the Communist Army in the Five Gods Temple head-on, and another part of it counterattacked and captured the rear route of Xixi - Five Gods Temple. The Communist Army in the Five Gods Temple was intercepted in the rear and collapsed. The 57th Regiment then continued to assault the suburbs of Dongtai City, breaking into the urban area along the Dinggong Bridge Haidao Bridge southwest of the city, and joining forces with the 56th Regiment that broke in from the Minsheng Factory south of the city at 8:00 AM. A moment later, the 189th Regiment also entered the city from the west gate and launched a mopping-up operation against the remaining Communist Army in the battlefield on the outskirts of the city.

By this point, the military operation of the entire half month from the 13th to the 27th had been completed successfully and quickly.

This battle had a bit of a "resentful" nature on the National Army's side. In mid-July, the 19th Brigade was ambushed by the Communist Army in Taixing and Xuanjiabao. After several days and nights of hard fighting, the National Army never gave up its strongholds and counterattacked in a very short time. As a result, the number of Communist Army corpses abandoned was more than five times the number of National Army casualties. In terms of the battle itself, the National Army can be said to have fully demonstrated the spirit of a soldier and achieved victory. However, in order to cover up their defeat, the Communist Army shamelessly published in the Xinhua Daily: more than 20,000 casualties of the 19th Brigade have all been wiped out. In fact, the National Army's losses were only more than 3,000 people.

"The National Army is not good at speaking! Hypocritical propaganda will naturally be pierced by the facts. We must have such an opportunity to tell the Communist Party: Is the 19th Brigade really defeated?" The reporter clearly remembers that this was a paragraph that Commander Li and Commander Yang of the 19th Brigade said to the reporter, waving their fists nervously.

### Small Waves in a Great Era Give the Communist Army a Huge Lesson

This opportunity finally came. Commander Li handed over almost all of the garrison duties in Dongtai to the two regiments of the 19th Brigade - the 56th Regiment that had previously defended Taixing and the 57th Regiment that had defended Xuanjiabao.

He continued to tell the reporter about their troop's operational style:

Our operational style is purely competitive. After the 56th Regiment of our brigade, which went north by land on October 14, recovered Shijiaji, the brothers of the 57th Regiment, who were advancing by water, rubbed their fists and palms to show something. Therefore, after the operation started on the 21st, they captured Shinian in one fell swoop on the 22nd. The capture of Shinian was done by the first and second battalions. After the third battalion recovered Shinian, they rushed to pursue northeast, reaching Wujiapu in one breath. Not only are the regiments and battalions like this, but even the companies and platoons have this competitive spirit. Every soldier of the 19th Brigade thinks like this in their heart: how can we maintain the honor of our Anti-Japanese War and not tarnish the three "military medals" that we received the most among the national troops.

Finally, he said to the reporter: "The recovery of Dongtai is more of a political success than a military victory. There are two points that can prove this: First, wherever the National Army goes, the local people often provide a lot of assistance in transportation, intelligence, or other aspects. In particular, once, there was an earthen dam across the river, and our motorboats could not pass. Dozens of people from the countryside, regardless of age, automatically gathered, regardless of the cold weather and wet clothes, jumped into the river to help us dig the dam, so that the motorboats could pass quickly. The second is the unrest within the Communist Army. This time, the number of Communist Army soldiers who surrendered with weapons was more than the number of Communist Army soldiers we captured. They cried when they saw the National Army. Their anti-war sentiment is very high, and the information they provided about the Communist Party was also very accurate." Commander Yang, with his head shaved and wearing a pair of glasses, looked like a scholar (in fact, he is indeed a military scholar who can write poetry and prose). The more he spoke, the happier he became.

The recovery of Dongtai, in the turbulent waves of a great era, is a small ripple, and may not leave too deep a mark on the course of the wheel of history; but at present, it will give the Communist Army a great lesson—

First, the National Army cannot be defeated. Hypocritical propaganda only arouses the sneer of discerning people.

Second, the power of the people is infinite. Whoever causes them to lose their families and be displaced is their enemy. For the sake of survival, for the sake of living and working in peace and contentment, they will automatically exert their power, and fight to the end at any cost.

Third, the "cadres" of the Communist Army are now gradually becoming aware that everyone has a conscience. Deceptive tricks can only deceive for a while. When their conscience is discovered, they will want to ask: "Why should we kill each other and cause war; why should we slaughter the people and lose all conscience?" At that time, I am afraid it will also be when the Communist Army collapses.

Spring and Autumn

### Mountains and Water - One of the "Legends of the West" side stories -

— Yang Cunren

The saying goes, "Guilin's mountains and waters are the best in the world," but in reality, Guilin's mountains, such as Duxiu Peak, are only beautiful, and the saying "Yangshuo's mountains and waters are the best in Guilin" is only because they are strangely beautiful. In the winter of the 19th year, I entered Sichuan by waterway, and when the boat passed through the Wu Gorge, I looked up at the Goddess Peak and other peaks floating in the clouds. The mountain scenery was like a painting, and it was also named for its beauty. Last autumn, I entered the edge of the Sichuan River and traveled along the upper reaches of the Minjiang River. After passing Longxi, I saw high peaks standing, shaped like a V. After traveling for two days, the mountain was shaped like a W, with the peaks turning and the road turning, the shape changing in myriad ways. After Diexi sank, the trails near Guanyin Cliff were steep and precipitous, the air was thin, and sand and rocks flew from time to time, earning it a reputation for danger. This spring, I left Songpan and passed the Great Snow Mountain. The wind was as cold as thorns, and the snow fell like sleet, as if entering the Arctic region. The mountains on the right were gentle, with snow that did not melt for years. The mountains on the left were rocky, with towering rock peaks. Although they could not accumulate snow, their color was like silver. In the snow, the sunlight shone on the rocks, sometimes presenting five colors. The peaks were already strange, but the colors were even stranger. The secrets of the universe were completely revealed to the Chinese.

Seawater is salty, and river water is yellow. Seeing more of them is not strange. The water in Diexi Lake is as blue as oil, flowing from the bottom of the sea. The surface of the water is still and has no ripples, which is strange; overlooking the three rivers from the mountains of Lianghekou, one stream is yellow, one stream is green, and one stream is black as ink, which is stranger; when it rained in Qingzhen Jiangkou, the Minjiang River flowed rapidly, and its turbidity was like the evil water under the Naihe Bridge. The momentum and color were enough to steal one's soul, which is the third strange thing.

### Grassland —— "Legends of the West" side story - Second -

— Yang Cunren

According to legend, a certain party's "28,000-mile Long March" ran through the southwestern provinces and arrived in Shaanxi after passing through the grasslands of Sichuan. The grasslands of Sichuan were described as dangerous as hell, which was very touching. After I arrived in Songpan, I yearned for and missed the grasslands, and I was determined to take a trip. According to the investigation, the grasslands are not swamps and ponds, but the large plateau on the edge of Sichuan. Although the rivers are crisscrossed, the hills are densely distributed everywhere. The Tibetan people use the grasslands as grazing areas, and cattle, horses, and sheep are their property. Tents are their houses, and there are houses only where there are Lama temples, and the houses are also temples of monks. Leaving the Songpan Huangsheng Pass and entering the grasslands, passing Baozuo and Shang'e Luo, and entering Qinghai, there are a total of thirty horse stations, and it takes a month for a horse to travel out of Sichuan.

The Yellow River originates in Jiehai and flows into Sichuan before reaching Qinghai. The large area of Sichuan is already alarming, and the Yellow River flowing into Sichuan is not recorded in geography textbooks, which is even stranger. When the Yellow River freezes, river ice is put into cattle hair bags, and if two bags are not changed in a day, the bags will burst. This river ice is transported to Songpan and called Qing salt. The water of the Yellow River is salty and can be turned into edible salt, which is even stranger. This spring, I rode out of Huangsheng Pass and continued to travel along the upper reaches of the Minjiang River. When I lectured at the Sanliba National Songpan Vocational School, I asked how far the grasslands were. They said that the places they had passed were generally called grasslands. The flowing water, hills, woods, and grass dams were all the same as Sanliba, so there was no need to go. This made me disappointed.

### Concerning the Translation of Musical Terminology

— Li Chi

It's been perhaps four or five years since I last put pen to paper to write about music! All my music books, scores, and records were lost in the war. After these several exiles and escapes, I no longer have the same state of mind as before. Three years ago in Guilin, I saw a "newly published" "Music Dictionary," but the material was a revised and altered version of the "Liangyou" edition from fifteen to twenty years ago. I casually flipped through it and couldn't help but be amazed at the editor's "miraculous power" to "resurrect" all the musicians who had died in the past quarter-century and make them alive and well. But at the time, I didn't have the energy to write about it. Isn't "having" always better than "not having"? That was wartime.

Recently, in "Chunqiu," I saw articles by Zhu Lixing, Zhang Ning, Joseph Zhu Wusheng, and others discussing the translation of musician names. I don't know why, but I wanted to try my hand at writing. But let me state upfront: first, I am a layman when it comes to music. I am incapable of "showing off my skills," let alone in front of an expert. I hope to simply throw out a broken tile and attract back a diamond. Second, I have no reference materials at hand while writing, so this entire piece is written under the premise of "if my memory doesn't deceive me." I only hope to raise questions; the solutions and conclusions, I hope, will come from experts and pioneers.

1. What to Translate?

Mr. Zhu proposed that the transliteration of Western musician names should be standardized. Everyone agrees with this sentiment. However, it seems that what should be reviewed and standardized is not limited to "the issue of transliteration in musical arts" (as Mr. Zhu originally titled it). The Chinese translation of composer names is only one aspect of unfairness.

Is it "小提琴" (xiǎo tí qín - violin), "四絋琴" (sì xián qín - four-stringed instrument), or "懷娥鈐" (huái é qián - a completely phonetic transcription)? Shouldn't this be standardized just like the Chinese translation of Beethoven's name?

Before the Pacific War in Hong Kong, I "overestimated my abilities" and wrote down a plan, hoping to create a Chinese translation table for musical terms and names within a few years, to be used for my own purposes. But this work "stopped shortly after starting" because it exceeded my capabilities.

(1) The most common titles, author names, and terms for musical forms on concert programs and famous records.

(2) Instrument names in orchestras and military bands: and the most common musical terms in solo performances and ensemble performances.

(3) The names of famous performers, conductors, orchestras, etc.

The above seems to be the most urgently needed. In addition to expanding on the above, I would at least like to include:

(4) Special terms and "proper nouns" in music theory and music history.

(5) Unique symbols and terms for the performance of various instruments on orchestral "scores."

(6) Terms for "Jazz" and "Swing." (I don't discriminate against them as much as the "academic school." I will omit the reason for now.)

(7) Musical terms and "proper nouns" in various folk music traditions.

(8) Others... (such as famous music educators, researchers, critics, authors, instrument makers, etc.) The question of how to translate composer names into Chinese seems to occupy only a relatively small proportion.

2. Difficult to Translate?

Are the nouns and names listed above difficult to translate? Yes! Extremely difficult! First, the difficulty lies in the collection, selection, and review of the original text. What should be the basis for pronunciation and the Shanghai dialect?

Second, how to decide whether to transliterate or translate by meaning.

Third, should existing Chinese translations be respected, or should they be re-translated?

Fourth, should absolute accuracy be prioritized, or should convenience be accommodated? What should be the dividing line? ...And others.

Difficult! Just look at those experts who spend their entire lives researching the catalog of a composer's works, and look at the Japanese "Broadcasting Corporation" which took five years and more than thirty experts to compile a provisional standard music vocabulary of less than a hundred pages. These can all serve as supporting evidence. I think this kind of work is best left to institutions like the "National Institute for Compilation and Translation." One person can only do a very small part at most.

Foreign languages are naturally an obstacle. Roughly counting, I'm afraid that just to achieve the first item in the above section would require encountering more than ten languages, even Hebrew, Latin, and Indian languages would be needed. When it comes to song titles, there are many allusions, legends, myths, personal anecdotes, etc... That's why I say it's extremely difficult! But difficult as it is, it must be done.

3. Square Characters?

Aside from translation by meaning, the square Chinese characters used as a tool for transliteration are a big problem. While they can sometimes help the translator cut corners, in more cases, they are like an old scale for weighing coal being used by a chemist as an analytical balance! The standard pronunciation of square characters is Beijing Mandarin, but the consonants, vowels, and their combinations in Beijing Mandarin are among the simplest of all existing Chinese dialects. Compared to the rhyme books of the Tang and Song dynasties, the "Poetry Rhymes" of the late Qing Dynasty had greatly reduced rhyme categories, and the "National Phonetic New Poetry Rhymes," based on Beijing Mandarin, further reduced the rhyme categories by removing the "entering tone." (This seems to be a general trend in the historical development of phonetics.) How can this one-wheeled "rickshaw" be equipped to become a universal transportation tool for land and sea?

We only need to count the number of empty squares on that "National Phonetic Commonly Used Characters List" which uses "sounds" as the latitude and "rhymes" as the longitude, and we will know how many squares are empty, and how pitifully few the pronunciations of the remaining characters are.

Not having enough is one problem, but another difficulty lies in the fact that square characters are not "phonetic alphabets," and each character also has a meaning. Even if the transliteration is correct, a transliteration like "悲多憤" (bēi duō fèn - a phonetic transliteration of Beethoven), can't be used in a thousand years!

4. Romanization?

Therefore, I believe that square characters are not as good as phonetic symbols, and the National Romanization system is more refreshing and flexible than phonetic symbols. It may be difficult to apply it universally at present, but I still hope that in dictionaries or vocabularies, words that are transliterated should be accompanied by the National Romanization system as phonetic symbols. It would be best to also note the "International Phonetic Alphabet," but this would go beyond the scope of "transliteration."

People who believe in "English omnipotence" may think that just using twenty-six letters is enough, but in fact, the difference between English and square characters is only "fifty steps versus a hundred steps"! Even using that "artificial" "International Phonetic Alphabet" specifically for phonetic transcription, recording other small ethnic languages and local languages, you have to add all sorts of auxiliary symbols to explain things, except for a few large ethnic languages. Stop saying "English is omnipotent"! In the end, this question boils down to the precision of transliteration.

5. Original Pronunciation?

Even if the "tools" of transliteration (such as square characters or phonetic symbols) are solved, studying the pronunciation of the original text is not necessarily an easy task. In larger ethnic languages, you can consult dictionaries of each language and then "convert" them like "official exchange rates" based on their original standards, but in the music of smaller ethnic groups, if the original text contains "obsolete words" and "rare words"..., you often encounter difficulties. For example, if a song title or main lyrics quote an ancient Greek or Fuzhou deity's name, how should it be handled? Should it be based on the original text used by the composer, or should one further trace the "original" pronunciation of the original text?

Many people think that the accents that people are familiar with can be recorded. I don't know that this is a huge danger. It is well known that not every American can pronounce Bach or Chopin correctly. Even with the transliteration of Mozart that Mr. Zhu mentioned, there would likely be many differences in how educated Austrians pronounce it in conversation. Because the standard pronunciation of "single words" in the dictionary is different from that in a "sentence," and "language changes with emotion" is an unbreakable rule, which I will explain later.

In short, I believe that establishing a standard for the Chinese translation of music terminology and proper nouns related to music is a difficult but urgently needed task. But "urgency" must also be "accurate," and "difficulty" must be "done." However, when it comes to "accuracy," there are limits, and the degree is lower when using square characters as a tool for transliteration. As mentioned in the example above, no chemist can rely on an old scale to measure a tiny amount of one-thousandth of a gram.

It's not just what is expressed in the form of poetry that is poetry. Novels, essays, dramas—anything that contains poetic elements can be called poetry. Shakespeare's "Hamlet" and "A Midsummer Night's Dream," Turgenev's "A House of Gentlefolk" and "Smoke," and Gogol's "Dead Souls" are all beautiful poems edited and published by humanity.

### An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 108

— Ye Jingfeng

Tsurumi, under the soft light of the dance hall, looked at the paper, holding down the uneven corner with one hand. On the paper, about the size of an ordinary envelope, were clearly printed three photos: one of Tsurumi getting off the plane, dressed in travel attire; one of Tsurumi in his gentlemanly attire that evening; and another a close-up, showing only a portion of his face, but with every detail of his features clear and his spirit radiant. Below the photos were arranged four large characters: "Person of Interest"! Several other lines of smaller text noted Tsurumi's date of birth, background, qualifications, current position, etc.

"Big Brother, now you know I wasn't making up rumors! Like this piece of paper, probably every related organization, every related person, has one in their hands. Big Brother, you've become an important person; but also a target of public criticism!" Ping said, smiling mischievously. At the same time, like performing a magic trick, without leaving a trace, she flicked her fingers and folded the paper back as it was. On the table, only the food menu remained. After she waved her hand over it repeatedly, the paper had disappeared. Pingzi even playfully flicked her rosy jade-like hand at Tsurumi, turning it over and letting it go, completely imitating the movements of a magician manipulating playing cards.

"I am grateful for Miss's consideration, needless to say..." Tsurumi also chimed in, quickly picking up the drink menu card, just in time to place it squarely on her outstretched palm as Pingzi had not yet withdrawn her hand. Unexpectedly, Pingzi flipped her palm, letting the card slide off and fall on the table, and leaned back into the chair, folding her jade arm. Her perfectly shaped small lips pouted up:

"My name is Pingzi, my surname is Nakamura, I'm twenty-four years old, born in Fukushima. Haven't you investigated that clearly yet? Even if you don't call me Pingmei—that's my most intimate Chinese poetic name—you can call me Pingzi, or Willow Poetry..." Her expression at this time really had a bit of poetic meaning, and could be painted, the title of the painting being "Like Resentment, Like Longing."

"Alright, Pingzi, I admit defeat!" Tsurumi smiled with a pained expression.

Pingzi sighed slightly, "Big Brother, you won't surrender. I'm the one surrendering... but I have one more heartfelt thing to say. If you don't mind, I'll say it; if you do mind, I'll still say it. I want to advise you: this time, Big Brother, you came back to Tokyo and joined such a terrifying secret organization. No matter what your motives are, it's best to leave Tokyo as soon as possible, whether you go back to work in your department or go to the Chinese mainland, because those are relatively one-sided matters, unlike here, which is multifaceted, and it's difficult to please any one side. This is my little contribution from the bottom of my heart." Pingzi simply explained the danger of Tokyo and the reason why she was ordered to monitor him.

After hearing these words, Tsurumi lit his cigar and paused for a moment, without answering Pingzi's words. Instead, he suddenly reached out and beckoned a waiter standing far away, whispering two words in his ear. The waiter responded and left. Only then did Tsurumi look at Pingzi and say, "When the music plays 'The Blue Danube,' I want to ask you to dance once. Won't I be refused?"

"I don't think any woman can refuse to dance with you, and of course I can't be an exception either." Pingzi became a little animated, immediately taking a sip of "Victory Rice."

### Poor Child

— Shao Fu

A person who has suffered a certain kind of pain and, once they have the means, immediately tries their best to relieve others of this pain is truly rare in today's society and worthy of praise.

I know of such a person in Shanghai. In his childhood, he was poor and relied on his mother to wash clothes for others to make a living. He was determined to make progress and studied hard in a poor children's home. Later, he went to a factory to work and study part-time. It was five miles from his home to the factory. He went early and returned late every day. He couldn't bear to wear the cloth shoes his mother made for him, so he took them off as he left the house and ran barefoot for ten miles back and forth. At that time, he made a wish that when he had the ability in the future, he would definitely establish more elementary schools for poor children to help those who had the same painful experience of being out of school as he did. After graduating, he left his hometown and came to Shanghai to make a living. He was hardworking and patient, starting as a police officer and later engaging in business. In a few years, he became very wealthy and had the financial resources to realize his dream. So he immediately founded an elementary school for poor children, charging students no fees and supporting it independently. Initially, he and his wife also served as teachers. Over the years, they have cultivated many young children. Currently, there are more than two hundred children in the school. The sound of music never ceases, and it has gained great reputation.

The reason why I am telling this story here is, of course, because I am touched and feel that if today's society is to progress, there should be more and more good people like this.

A person who has experienced the pain of hunger can do their best to prevent others from being hungry. A person who has experienced the pain of cold can do their best to prevent others from being cold. How can this society not progress? Of course, we would prefer that people who have not experienced suffering could also do this. However, "throwing away the teaching stick and going to beg," aren't there too many people like this? Shouldn't these people be ashamed if they read the story above?

Secret History of World War II

### Atomic Bomb Nearly Used by the Nazis 2

— Translated by Lan Ning from the November issue of "Reader's Digest"

At that time, the Norsk Hydro plant was building a new sluice gate to increase the production of heavy water. Einar obtained a job there through the introduction of his brother. With infinite care, he organized a reliable group of his most trusted friends, from which he obtained all kinds of information about the factory. This information was telegraphed to the intelligence hub in London.

According to Einar's report, the production of heavy water was increasing rapidly; the products were shipped to Germany every month. The British War Cabinet ordered the Combined Operations Headquarters to organize a commando team to immediately attack Norsk Hydro.

The Combined Operations Headquarters used all the experience of previous battles to undertake this most difficult task. The unpredictable roaring of violent air currents over the Klegge Mountains made Norway the most difficult area in Europe for parachutes or gliders to invade. But with the help of Dr. Tronstad (who directed the construction of the correct model of the target and explained its internal situation), and Einar's accurate reports, the Grouse team (which was their secret code name this time) was finally completed on paper.

Four carefully selected Norwegians, all residents of the area who were skilled at skiing, would parachute in advance to Einar to prepare to meet the invading British airborne troops. Twice, bombers took the commando team to the skies over Norway, ready to parachute, but were forced to retreat due to thick clouds. Finally, on a certain evening in October 1942, they finally moved; a few hours later, all five people jumped into the dark night one after another. The next morning, they found themselves in the mountains, more than a hundred miles away from the activity site. They spent two days finding the equipment scattered everywhere.

Grouse

For the next fifteen days, the "Grouse" team made a typical snow march. At an altitude of four thousand feet, with temperatures consistently below zero, one person could carry at most sixty pounds of equipment. This meant that to carry his one hundred and twenty pounds of equipment, each person had to walk the same road three times. Each person's daily ration was only a small piece of cheese, a small handful of flour, and four biscuits.

On November 9th, the commander anxiously waiting at the Combined Operations Headquarters heard the "Grouse" team's secret code. They had arrived at a location near Norsk Heide Rotho and had contacted Einar, ready to use radio and lights to guide the destruction team going by glider.

On November 19th, two Halifax bombers departed from England, each towing a glider full of airborne troops. A few hours later, a special operations officer in Norway telegraphed that the bomber and glider had been lost and crashed, and all the personnel in the aircraft were either dead or captured.

Even worse news followed. A German military intelligence officer, searching the wreckage of the plane, found a map with the town of Vermok, where the heavy water plant was located, marked with a red line. The highest administrative officer in Norway, Dupven, and the commander-in-chief, Falkenhorst, hurriedly went to Vermok to inspect the defenses. Nazi stormtroopers searched the surrounding area and arrested everyone suspected of being pro-British. But they did not catch any members of the "Grouse" team.

Hardship

In London, the hardworking Combined Operations Headquarters could only start all over again. The plan to attack using gliders was abandoned. Six Norwegian members of the Special Forces would parachute in. Treponse used maps and models to train them. Time was running out. The "Grouse" team's limited food and batteries for the wireless were running out, struggling to survive in a snow-covered cabin on a mountain top four thousand feet high. Except for the team leader, they were all suffering from illness. Miles away, Einar was hiding from the Nazi agents' search, but every few days, he still skied in the twilight, sneaking to the vicinity of Vermok to meet with those loyal informants.

Soon, Einar radioed London an almost unbelievable message: for some reason, the Germans believed that the commandos' target was not the Norsk Heide Rotho plant, but the new sluice gate being built nearby. A hundred new guards had been sent to the sluice gate, while only twelve were left at the factory.

By the end of December, the "Gunnerside" team (this was another secret code name) was ready to depart. One night, these six Norwegians parachuted onto the frozen Skrykken Lake, thirty miles north of where the "Grouse" team was hiding. The most violent snowstorm in decades swept across the mountains, preventing them from setting off. These Norwegians struggled through five days, freezing and starving, in a deserted house. When the snowstorm had passed, they continued their journey. As they approached the meeting place, they suddenly saw two skiers in the distance. If they encountered a German patrol at this time, things would be bad. One of the "Gunnerside" team members put on a disguise, put on a civilian hat, and went to meet the stranger. If it was a German, he would pretend to be a deer hunter. The rest lay down in the snow, holding their guns tightly in their hands. But then, breaking through the tight wind, came three ecstatic cheers. The "Gunnerside" and "Grouse" had finally met.

That's How It Was

In a streetcar in Chicago, I saw a ticket seller being very polite to the passengers. This was a rare thing. After the passengers got off, I chatted with him.

"Ah," he explained, "Five years ago, I saw in the newspaper that a person had given a sum of money in his will to someone he didn't really know, because of his modesty. "That's possible," I thought, "This might happen to me." So, I started treating the passengers like friends. Later, I felt that treating people this way was good for both them and me. Now, I no longer care whether someone will give me a million dollars. I still continue to do this!"

How Much is it Worth?

When my wife lost her purse, we had to jump off the train again. At this time, a porter ran over breathlessly and returned the purse. He refused our thank-you money. "If you don't mind my being presumptuous, ma'am, I'd like to know how much money is in your purse in total."

My wife told him. He took out a small notebook and added the number to a pile of numbers below. "I'm recording the numbers to calculate how much valuable honesty is worth to me in the future," he explained.

A Cross-Section of Shanghai

### The Organization of Beggars 2

— Huang Jiamo

The Formation of the Beggar Gang

The beggar gangs are individual organizations composed of countless small groups. Each small group must have a "reliable" "Uncle Group" as its leader, leading from seven or eight to more than twenty people. The most important condition is to pre-occupy a base-like location. Then, they can cultivate power in the nearby territory. Therefore, at this time, the problem of food and lodging has been solved, and they can naturally carry out "mooching" activities.

The child beggars taken in by the "Uncles" are called "Little Ghosts." These people are mostly poor children wandering the streets, most of whom are homeless. Once taken in and provided with food and accommodation, they must obey orders completely, and all the money they mooch must be handed over in full. Only when they are old enough to be self-sufficient can they leave. At that time, they can also lead their own "Little Ghosts" and join the ranks of the "Uncle Group." If they are naturally clumsy and lack the ability to stand alone even when they are older, and fail to obtain the position of "Uncle," their status is between the "Uncle" and the "Little Ghost," and they are called "Party Members." In addition, there is a kind of middle-aged down-and-out rogue who has not gone through the "Little Ghost" stage before falling into beggary. Although they are reluctantly taken in by the "Uncles," they are ultimately without support in the gang, and the gang members call them "Foreign Gun Members." The "Uncles" refer to each other as "Brothers in Mooching." Because they are in the same boat, they usually pay attention to "building relationships." If a conflict occurs and they cannot coordinate with each other, they must invite "white-collar workers" with face from various sections to come out to evaluate and resolve the situation. If it still cannot be resolved, they have no choice but to resort to force.

Their Headquarters

The primary question for the establishment of each beggar gang subgroup is whether it possesses a territory. Beggar brothers without a territory are like stray souls in Shanghai, with no place to settle down, and it is impossible to talk about forming a small group. In the former Qing Dynasty, beggars from outside gangs had beggar factories to live in. However, in their eyes, the Old Brothers were still some non-mainstream beggars, and they had no right to set foot in beggar factories. Therefore, the Old Brothers had to rely on their own strength to develop outwards.

Shanghai is densely populated, and the alleys are closely connected. In each alley, there are always empty spaces at the front and back, which is the New World for the Old Brothers. They called on friends and relatives and occupied these places as their residence. These occupied places are collectively called "Buckets" by the people in the know. However, because it is an open-air territory, they have to temporarily move to avoid the severe winter and rain. Therefore, the most ideal "Bucket" is the place under the overpass buildings inside and outside the alleys. Because it can be supported as a bed to store quilts and sundries. Even if rain and snow fall suddenly, it is not enough to worry about. Therefore, the place under the overpass building is indeed the Golden City Jade Palace in the "Bucket," and it is a place that the brothers in the gang must compete for.

### Too Late

— Yu Feng

A gentleman went to a restaurant to eat. When he saw the dishes served, he sighed regretfully.

"Ah! If I had known there were such dishes, I should have come a few days earlier."

"Thank you, sir, for thinking highly of us, it's really..." The waiter hurried to be polite.

"Don't get me wrong, what I mean is that if I had eaten such a good dish a few days earlier, it would have been fresh."

"……!"

Beauty and Banknotes

According to the newspaper, Yang Xiuqiong, the mermaid swimmer who was once famous in China, has recently married a celebrity from Sichuan Province, ×××. It is said that the condition is a marriage guarantee of 200 million yuan, plus 500 million yuan for new home equipment. Hero and beauty, both are rare, which is really enviable. However, the fact that this includes a "condition" of 700 million yuan is a bit of a drawback to the good story. It is said that this gentleman won 7 billion in a night of gambling in Shanghai, so it is really easy to use one-tenth of the gambling money to win the heart of a beauty. Writing here, I also thought of such a thing that recently happened in Fuzhou: Mayor Yan of Fuzhou suggested that the budget revenue and expenditure for next year are insufficient by 600 million yuan, so he proposed collecting a fee for the management of prostitutes to make up for it. This has been approved by the Municipal Council, but when women's groups learned of it, they were greatly angered and held a symposium to strongly oppose it. The reason is: "Women cannot be treated as commodities." The mere amount of 600 million yuan has caused an uproar, and big topics such as "humanitarianism" and "women's movement" have been brought out. In fact, it is really rare to see and strange to hear. Don't you see that even marriage is conditional here, and it's 700 million yuan? We are singing praises and admiring it, it's too late to do that! How can we talk about "opposition"? Long live the beauty! Long live the banknotes!

Wool Blanket Wool Blanket

According to rumors, the allocation of American military blankets to public school personnel, which has already been registered, may become a pie in the sky. This is because the Bureau of Materials Supply is already declaring "no goods." It would be fine if there were no goods, but according to a news agency: "A few days ago, an American Jewish businessman, using the name of Jialing Foreign Company, purchased 5,000 wool blankets from the bureau at one time. A few hours after this businessman received the delivery note, a large number of blankets appeared in the black market trading places for American goods and materials in Central Lane of Sichuan Road and other places." This is clearly and truly "there are goods," but they are monopolized for "delivery" by some high-ranking Chinese who are blinded by profit. When we see the "black goods" on the roadside, we really miss those "precious goods" who control the power of allocation. The "precious goods" may only want to make a fortune by giving "Ning to foreign businessmen, not to their families," but you should think again: The "Bureau of Materials Supply" is an organ of the Chinese government. Can the ancient Chinese training of "the distinction between righteousness and profit" be disregarded so blatantly? The allocated blankets were delivered to us in good faith by allied countries. Have we forgotten the "distinction between humans and beasts" that people pointed out in the American Evening News? Banknotes will eventually run out, but our anger will not end there!

Black Market for Feces

In the season when rice is as expensive as pearls, farmers regard feces and garbage, which are the main components of fertilizer, as treasures. In the city, we often dislike the noise of the dung carts at dawn. In fact, from the hard work of these people collecting and transporting, the cleanliness of the city is maintained, and our lives are also indirectly cultivated and nourished. Before China's chemical fertilizer industry is fully developed, feces still occupy an important part of farmers' production costs, so the black market price of feces has soared in the past two days as the wheat season is about to begin. Shanghai businessmen are so smart that they are omnipresent. In addition to expressing our admiration, we really need to submit a memorandum to the authorities: Shanghai City can now produce more than 2,000 tons of garbage and 3,000 tons of feces per day. These are the most suitable raw materials for compost. Why can't we make an overall plan to manufacture and directly distribute them to farmers? "It is hateful to discard goods on the ground, and it is not necessary to store them for oneself." In the midst of suppressing grain prices, we deeply hope that the bureau will pay attention to the utilization of these wastes that people discard like worn-out shoes, effective utilization, and scientific utilization!

Beyond Praise

Last month, a funny story happened in Hangzhou: Rickshaw puller and city council member Zhao Tingxiu was beaten and humiliated by the police. As a result, the authorities investigated and punished the murderer and apologized. It is said that this fact that "represents the spirit of Chinese democracy" has "shocked the world" because major American newspapers attached great importance to it and translated and published it in a prominent position. The news published by them was even more detailed and accurate than the news published by local newspapers in Hangzhou. The good news spread far and wide, which was originally a grand event, and many sensitive people took it as an honor to deal with things. However, the reason why people especially publicize our democratic spirit is precisely because there are too many places where we are obscured by the undemocratic spirit; rare news is enough to arouse interest, so there is such a lively performance. If this matter had happened in the beginning, and Zhao Tingxiu was only a rickshaw puller and not a city council member, then a beating and a few days of detention would have been too commonplace. With the power of the police, he would never have tolerated a person engaged in a lowly occupation such as rickshaw pulling arguing with him in front of him. City council members are officials, and rickshaw pullers are civilians. After all, there is still a big difference in the treatment received by officials and civilians. Before the "event representing the spirit of Chinese democracy" praised by the American newspapers, we should feel infinite panic and shame.
