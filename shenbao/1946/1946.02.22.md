The economic rights and interests of the Northeast, except for those stipulated in the Sino-Soviet Treaty, are not allowed to be violated in the slightest. (2) To arouse national compatriots to pay attention to the Northeast issue.

### Our Country's Negotiations on the Northeast Issue Will Not Make Concessions Beyond the Treaty, Chairman Wu of Xing'an Province Will Go to the Wartime Capital

[Dispatch from Chongqing of This Newspaper on the 21st] This morning, this reporter visited the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and was informed that (1) Negotiations on the Northeast economic issue are continuing in Chongqing. (2) Our country will not make concessions on the Northeast issue beyond the Sino-Soviet Treaty. (3) The crux between China and the Soviet Union mainly lies in different views and interpretations of the treaty. For example, in Article 1 of the annex to the Sino-Soviet Treaty regarding the Chinese Changchun Railway Agreement, the phrase "subsidiary undertakings directly for the use of the railway" is viewed very differently by both parties. However, there is no issue of interpretation regarding the withdrawal of troops and the return of materials.

[Dispatch from Peiping of the Associated Press on the 21st] Foreign observers here believe that the situation in Northeast China has quickly unfolded. The Chinese side now openly admits that the takeover work in the Northeast has completely come to a standstill. According to the Chinese-language evening newspaper, General Xiong Shihui, Director of the Northeast Headquarters, is currently stationed in Peiping, maintaining absolute silence and awaiting the final orders of the government. According to visitors who arrived here from the Soviet military occupation area in eastern Mongolia, a new Soviet division that arrived there came directly from Germany and is still using German marks to shop.

[Dispatch from Changchun of the Central News Agency on the 20th] Wu Huanzhang, Chairman of Xing'an Province, and Liu Guangpei, Director of the Relief Administration Branch, flew to Peiping today. Five Mongolian representatives from Xing'an Province accompanied them. Wu will also return to Chongqing. It is reported that Wu has been here for many days with his takeover personnel, and the issue of the takeover of Xing'an Province has not yet been negotiated.

[Dispatch from Changchun of This Newspaper on the 20th] Chairman Wu Huanzhang and representatives of the Hailar Mongolian Banner left here by plane today to fly to Peiping. They will go to Chongqing. Liu Guangpei also left here. According to reports, this plane flew from Peiping this morning, which is the only Chinese plane seen here in the past eight days.

[Dispatch from Changchun of This Newspaper on the 20th] The group of 45 Hailar Mongolian Banner representatives who accompanied Chairman Wu of Xing'an Province to Peiping today arrived here from Hailar a few days ago. Their trip is related to the "Eastern Mongolia" autonomy issue. Hailar belongs to Xing'an Province, and the provincial government is still controlled by Boyan Mandu, the former puppet Manchukuo provincial governor. Boyan has long sought independence, and has in fact created an autonomous independent state. This time, sending representatives to Changchun and then to Peiping is clearly to seek a legal basis.

[Dispatch from Nanjing of the United Press on the 21st] According to official announcements, the Chinese government desires to make the 5,000-mile-long border between China and the Soviet Union an unarmed and peaceful border, no different from the border between the United States and Canada.

### National Army to Withdraw from Northern Vietnam, China and France Reach Agreement, Mu Dai Declares to French Colonial Affairs Committee

[Dispatch from Paris of Agence France-Presse on the 20th] French Colonial Minister Mu Dai declared to the Colonial Affairs Committee of the National Constituent Assembly today: The governments of China and France have reached an agreement stipulating that the Chinese army will withdraw from Vietnam and be replaced by French troops.

I am confident that China and France will continue to cooperate closely and work together to rebuild the world."

### Army to Implement Reduction in Size Within Six Months, Quota Set at 800,000

Army Organization Temporarily Retained Before Military Orders are Unified

[Express Dispatch from Nanjing of This Newspaper on the 21st] Chongqing News: Although the new organization of the National Defense Army has not been announced, judging from the report of Lin Wei, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Military Administration, at the Political Consultative Conference, the second deliberation of this Military Reorganization Conference, and General Wedemeyer's recent speech at the Military Reorganization Conference, the army organization after the reorganization, before the unification of military orders, will temporarily retain the organization of the Group Army and the Army. Once military orders are unified, transportation is restored, and public security is ensured, the Group Army will be abolished, and the Army will be reduced to the Division, the Division to the Brigade, and the organization of the Regiment will be enriched and strengthened to meet modern requirements (the current strength of the national army, in terms of organization, includes 89 infantry armies and 140 divisions, including the three divisions of the Communist 18th Group Army). The cavalry consists of 10 armies and 13 divisions. In terms of numbers, there are approximately 3.8 million soldiers. If the expanded army and the puppet troops in North China and Northeast China are included, the total number is at least 4.5 million. Based on the national population of 450 million, each hundred people support one soldier, which should be sufficient to maintain peace at home and abroad. However, the current situation is the opposite. Therefore, after the news of President Chiang's advocacy of 精兵主義 (elite troopism) at the Reorganization Conference was released, generals and the people across the country unanimously supported it. It is reported that the Military Affairs Commission has decided to reduce the existing army strength to 1.8 million within six months, which is a major prerequisite for saving and building the country. The progress of this plan is currently encountering obstacles. According to qualified military personnel, the reorganization of the army has been delayed due to obstacles, and China's finances will also face an unimaginable crisis.

### Report on the Crimes of the Enemy in Nanjing

[Dispatch from Nanjing of the Central News Agency on the 20th] The preliminary investigation report on the crimes of the enemy in the capital city, compiled by the Chief Prosecutor Chen Guang of the Capital City Local Court Prosecutor's Office, was officially disclosed.

3.  American Concern for China

Due to the recent fading situation, the United States has become increasingly concerned about China. We can say that American concern for China did not begin today, but recent trends have become more obvious. After Washington announced the Yalta Agreement, public opinion was in uproar. Article 2 of the Yalta Agreement clearly pointed out that "the Soviet Union should restore the rights of the former Russian Empire, which were damaged by Japan's cunning attack in 1904." At the same time, American newspapers unanimously criticized the agreement after its announcement, especially regarding the situation in Northeast China. For example, the editorial of the "New York Herald Tribune" on December 12 stated:

"The price of Soviet participation in the Pacific is stipulated in the Yalta Agreement. Although there are some criticisms of the Yalta Agreement in general, if the Soviet Union can abide by its promises and respect Chinese sovereignty, this is not something to criticize too harshly. If the Soviet Union can firmly adhere to its promises in spirit and in letter to maintain Chinese sovereignty, then everything will be fine. However, in recent months, the actions of military officials in the three eastern provinces have been somewhat unsatisfactory. Sometimes Chinese officials have not been treated properly. Large quantities of food and machinery have been moved away, and some well-equipped local armies are now expanding their power. There have also been so-called independence movements. The United States has a significant concern in maintaining the territorial integrity of China (including the three eastern provinces). For the past ten years, the United States has opposed every attempt by a foreign country to rule any part of China. For the above reasons, the Soviet Union's future actions in the three eastern provinces will be the best test of whether US-Soviet relations will improve or worsen."

Precisely because the United States does not trust "such a powerful country" as the Soviet Union, it wants to "oppose a foreign country ruling any part of China," and it expresses this by reiterating the "Open Door" policy and maintaining China's territorial sovereignty and integrity.

From this, we can get a concept: In order to reduce its own sacrifices in the war against Japan, Britain and the United States accommodated the Soviet Union, being generous at the expense of others. They would rather regret it later. Just as the Japanese pirates had just surrendered and the people of democratic countries around the world were overwhelmed with victory, some people had already coldly pointed it out. (Such as the remarks of Powell and others in the local "Millard's Review," which the United States is only now taking seriously.)

The "New York Herald Tribune" editorial on February 7 also said: "...Although the interests of American merchants must be sacrificed, the basic desire of the United States in the three eastern provinces should be to maintain the traditional forces of Chinese territorial integrity. The three eastern provinces are Chinese in race, language, and culture, not Soviet. Normal economic relations between China and the Soviet Union in the three eastern provinces should not be opposed. However, any attempt by the Soviet Union to follow in Japan's footsteps and exercise imperialist control over the wealthy three eastern provinces must be strongly opposed. ...The independence and welfare of China and Korea should be given the highest priority."

Not only public opinion circles think so, but the American government authorities have also publicly stated this. Before the announcement of the Yalta Agreement, US Secretary of State Byrnes reiterated the importance of maintaining China's "Open Door" policy. He also stated that he was deeply concerned about the Sino-Soviet negotiations. According to a Washington dispatch from the US News Service on the 12th: "US Secretary of State Byrnes declared yesterday in response to reporters' questions that the Chinese National Government will respect the decision on the independence of Outer Mongolia. ...Byrnes continued that President Chiang had indicated that China and the Soviet Union were negotiating on the handling of Japanese property and equipment in the Northeast. The US has requested China to keep it informed of the progress of the negotiations, and we have now received a report from China. We believe that this issue should be discussed by the Far Eastern Commission (especially the compensation committee established in this regard)."

And on the 13th, the Chongqing United Press had the following report: US Secretary of State Byrnes requested the Chinese government to inform the United States of the progress of the Sino-Soviet negotiations. This matter has been welcomed by Chinese officials. They believe that this can reduce the unexpected concessions that China will make before the Soviet withdrawal and make it possible to publicize issues that cause anxiety to the Chinese government. They agree with Byrnes's opinion that the Far Eastern Commission should handle Japanese spoils of war.

From this, it can be seen that America's anxiety has reached the point of "blurting out." Seeing this situation developing, from the perspective of an observer, wouldn't China's future be the same as that of Lebanon, Syria, Iran, Greece, and the Dutch East Indies?

4.  Seeking a Way Out from Historical Lessons

China defeated the Japanese pirates, but the psychology of arrogance and self-importance among a few people is no different from that of a "closed-door era." We have involuntarily entered the 1950s, but our minds still do not understand our true destiny. What is the difference between this and the "closed-door era" in history?

Only by accepting the lessons of history can we seek a way out for the nation in the future. Therefore, we must understand history.

We must recognize that the East's defeat by the West was a matter of the Opium War era. The Qing Dynasty's missteps led to the East falling into the fate of Africa and India. As the saying goes, "When the Qin loses its deer, the whole world chases after it." The modern history of China's coastline is a history of the evolution of the balance of power among the great powers, and the turmoil in China's situation is closely related to the international balance of power in the East.

Before the July 7th Incident, Japan had a very long period of time when its position in China was superior to that of other powers. Its power was inserted between the two great powers of Britain and Russia in the East Asian continent. Later, Imperial Russia disintegrated, and Japan inherited its position. Its advantage surpassed that of Britain, and Britain happened to gradually decline, which made Japan feel complacent. This promoted its aggressive ambitions... and eventually led to the fatal blow from the United States, which insisted on the "Open Door" policy.

Originally, after China regained its strength, the balance of power on the continent could be completely eliminated. But in fact, it is "nominal but not real." China is still weak now. Therefore, the current situation in East Asia is only a restoration of the situation when Imperial Russia's power was at its peak in the East, not a restoration of the situation when the Qing Empire was at its peak. China may be able to reverse its decline, but defeating Japan does not mean that it has reversed its decline. After the Cairo Declaration, China joined the ranks of the great powers. Last year's victory over Japan has gradually stabilized its international status. In addition, the shackles it has suffered for a century, such as consular jurisdiction and concessions, have been abolished, so it can take advantage of this opportunity to strive for revitalization in order to match its name with its reality.

However, new unequal treaties have already been added, and China's prospects for free development are still hindered. China shares the same fate as Iran and Korea. This is precisely the objective new balance of power at work, and the United States has inadvertently called out the call to reiterate China's "Open Door" policy. How should the Chinese nation, which has just been liberated after a century of struggle and is about to be bound again, be vigilant and strive to wash away its humiliation? Seeing the opportunity to turn weakness into strength fleeting, I urge everyone to turn around and take a look, and stop letting our own people bicker and squabble over the spoils.

We have witnessed the current crises in the Northwest and Northeast. We recall the results of the Northern Song and Southern Ming dynasties seeking foreign aid, which makes people shudder. But we predict that China's future destiny will not be completely at the mercy of foreign "northern tribes." This is precisely because the international balance of power has acted as our savior, but if we completely rely on the "Open Door" policy and throw ourselves into the arms of foreign countries, what kind of world will China be? Isn't the future doomed to eternal destruction? It must be understood that using the international balance of power is a method of last resort, which can only be used once and not again, and one must not become complacent as a result! But this time, it seems that we will have to go down the old road again, which is forced. Diplomacy is not our real way out. We must rely on our own efforts. There are two paths ahead for everyone to choose, which way to go?

The failure of the Xinhai Revolution was because it placed too much emphasis on overthrowing the Manchus and neglected everything else. If, at the current stage of victory in the Anti-Japanese War, we also place too much emphasis on the victory gained by defeating Japanese imperialism and neglect the construction work in the future, and everyone still does not work together harmoniously, then our efforts over the past eight years will not be more successful than the Xinhai Revolution. After the Xinhai Revolution, we didn't know about the international balance of power at all. Even the warlords themselves were involved in the power struggles of the great powers, resulting in a mess before the 14th year of the Republic of China, and the problems of Outer Mongolia and Tibet were never properly resolved. At the current stage after the victory in the Anti-Japanese War, we cannot allow history to repeat itself. Our current task is to establish basic national policies. We are not xenophobic. We want to study how to maintain this balance of power, so that one side no longer "exclusively occupies" China or "shares" China; but that China can break through the international cracks and achieve the true freedom and independence of the nation. (The End)

### The Soviet Union Announces the Incorporation of the Kuril Islands and Southern Sakhalin Island into its Territory; All Banks and Enterprises Are Nationalized; Japan Requests the Repatriation of People from Soviet-Occupied Areas

[Reuters, Moscow, 21st] The Chairman of the Supreme Soviet Presidium issued an order yesterday, announcing that the transportation, banks, enterprises, public utilities, and transportation equipment of the Kuril Islands and Southern Sakhalin Island would be nationalized. The two places were ceded to the Soviet Union by the secret agreement of the Yalta Conference. Another order combines the Kuril Islands and Southern Sakhalin Island into one province, incorporating them into the Khabarovsk Krai of the Soviet Far East. Sakhalin Island is a long, narrow island off the northeast coast, which was previously divided between the Soviet Union and Japan. The southern part of the island belonged to Japan, but is now occupied by the Soviet Union.

[United Press, Tokyo, 20th] The Japanese government has repeatedly formally requested the United Nations to assist in the repatriation of Japanese people from Soviet-occupied areas. Its most recent request was forwarded by the Supreme Commander's Headquarters to the Washington government two days ago. Further actions will be decided by Washington.

Yesterday, a mass rally was held in Tokyo to petition the government to make further efforts to repatriate Japanese residents.

### Regarding the Atomic Secret Leak Case, the Soviet Union Responds with a Statement, Saying That the Soviet Union Knows More Than the Information Obtained; Canada Captures the Leader of Foreign Spies

[Reuters, London, 21st] Moscow Radio broadcast a statement by the Soviet government yesterday, saying that some Soviet spies had obtained certain technical information from Canada. However, after research, it was found that the Soviet Union's technology in this area was even more advanced than what was learned. The actions of these spies were not ordered, so they have been withdrawn. Since the Canadian government first announced the "leak of secrets," Canadian newspapers and radio stations have abused me with attacks. The Soviet government believes that it is necessary to draw their attention to the fact that the Canadian government's attitude directly encourages attacks on the Soviet Union, which is not in line with normal relations between the two countries. The above statement has been delivered to the Canadian Chargé d'Affaires in the Soviet Union by the Soviet Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs.

[United Press, Ottawa, 21st] A government spokesman declared today that the Soviet Union is making a big fuss about the Canadian spy case. The Soviet Union's official note should arrive here this Thursday. The Canadian government will immediately give a brief reply, and then wait for the results of the thorough investigation of the case. Then it will reply to the Soviet Union point by point.

[Agence France-Presse, Ottawa, 20th] The Canadian government denied today that the severance of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Canada is imminent, and denied that it has ever considered this.

[Reuters, Ottawa, 21st] Regarding the leak of certain secrets, the Royal Commission is still conducting a major investigation. The Canadian government is being urged by the parties to publish a new official report on this matter as soon as possible.

Oliphant participated in the manufacture of the atomic bomb in the United States. He said: "I am very pleased with Byrnes's revelation. British scientists have long known about this. We all know the manufacturing method of a certain raw material, but I do not intend to announce what the second raw material is. We only know its general outline. No Englishman participated in the manufacturing of that part of the atomic bomb."

### Financial Controls Take Effect; Prices Fall in Tokyo

### Relations Between the Great Powers Reach an Alarming Level of Tension; British Conservative MP Warns in the House of Commons; Soviet Diplomacy Focuses Pressure on the Mediterranean Region

[Reuters, London, 21st] The British House of Commons began a two-day foreign policy debate yesterday. Conservative MP Macmillan, who served as Cabinet Minister Resident in the Mediterranean during the end of the war, made an important speech, solemnly warning that the spirit of cooperation between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union during the war has been undermined by a high degree of suspicion. Soviet diplomacy seems to be focusing pressure on the Mediterranean region and the Middle East, infringing on long-established and recognized British interests in the region. Relations between the great powers have reached an alarming level of tension. What does Soviet Russia want? What is its underlying motivation? Is it the same as the expansionist policy of the Tsarist era in the 19th century? Does Soviet Russia have the ambition to rule the world? Is its purpose to realize its imperialism, or to restore its international communist ideals? Are the militarists regaining their power? The above questions are all possible explanations for Soviet actions. He also said: "Today's world has indeed been divided into economic, political, and military spheres of influence. We must not conceal the differences of opinion between the great powers. Statesmen should seek ways to resolve them. As far as the Soviet Union is concerned, I believe that it can only be resolved through personal contact or direct negotiations. Why doesn't Marshal Stalin take the lead in restoring the past relations between the three powers? All of this has created an atmosphere of suspicion. The only thing missing is large-scale espionage activities."

### Letter to the Editor: The Issue of Academic Status of Private Schools in Shanghai during the Anti-Japanese War

Editor: I have an educational question to ask for an answer or to forward to the relevant authorities for explanation. Because I saw in the education column of your newspaper that graduates of enemy and puppet vocational schools and above in the recovered areas are holding registration and examination. The so-called "enemy and puppet" of course refers to schools established by the enemy and puppet governments. I do not know whether private vocational schools and above in Shanghai after the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War had obtained the qualification recognized by the Ministry of Education, and when the Pacific War broke out, the Japanese invaders occupied the concession, unwilling to be oppressed by the enemy and puppets, and unwilling to be used by them, they were forced to close down. Their spirit of loyalty and self-preservation is commendable. In this situation, the Ministry of Education has not yet promulgated a clear statement on their academic status of graduates. Instead, the schools established by the enemy and puppets alone enjoy the light of victory. Moreover, when choosing a school to study in those days, I had no strength to go to the rear area, and in the occupied area, instead of entering the door of the enemy and puppet, it was better to go to a private school, which was relatively clean. I earnestly hope that the education authorities will pay attention to this in order to encourage those who seek to be good. (Yang Qi)

Editor's note: Mr. Yang's remarks are not without merit. Before the outbreak of the Pacific War, although the private vocational schools and above in this city had not been recognized by the Ministry of Education, their academic status of graduates, except for the schools attached to the enemy, should be handled flexibly and recognized, so as to show consolation and to clarify the obedience. That is my humble opinion. What do the education authorities think?

### Important Emergency Measures by the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration: Unlimited Sale of Flour

From yesterday, in addition to announcing the fundamental cancellation of the low-price sale to big cake stalls, noodle shops, and pasta snack shops that have been implemented for the past two months, the following new methods were adopted for completely unrestricted distribution: (1) The qualifications of buyers are not limited, and anyone can buy; (2) The quantity is not limited, and any number of bags are prepared for supply; (3) The price is set at 6,000 national currency per bag, which is 2,500 yuan lower than the market price; (4) Calculated in units, each household must apply to buy at least one unit at a time, and each unit has a total of 20 bags, and the total number of units is unlimited; (5) The administration has entrusted 12 banks to handle various procedures, including the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau at 36 Jiujiang Road, the Shanghai Commercial Savings Bank at 50 Ningbo Road, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank at 123 Fuzhou Road, the China Industrial Bank at 130 Beijing Road, the Zhejiang Xingye Bank at 630 Beijing Road, the Continental Bank at 111 Jiujiang Road, the Guohua Bank at 356 Beijing Road, the Zhongnan Bank at 110 Hankou Road, the Jin Cheng Bank at 200 Jiangxi Road, the China Reclamation Bank at 239 Beijing Road, the China Agricultural and Industrial Bank at 348 Henan Road, and the Zhonghui Bank at 143 Zhongzheng Road.

Restricting Entry Permits to the Rice Market

In order to restrict transactions, the Grain Administration Special Envoy's Office posted a notice in the market yesterday, saying: "In the case of the market being the place for the Shanghai rice industry to discuss transactions, when rice prices fluctuate indefinitely, the market should pay attention to strengthening management, preventing speculation, and avoiding manipulation, so that rice prices in the city tend to be stable. In the past, the market issued entry permits to members of the bean rice industry and rice industry associations, as well as brokers, etc., with a large and complex number of people, and management was difficult. Starting from today, the market should print new entry permits and strictly fill them out. Each rice firm should issue at most two entry permits. Rice firms that do not settle silver and goods in the market should be limited to one permit. The entry permits of brokers should be issued with special care. As for vendors, their rice is entrusted to rice firms for sale, and rice firms have their own reputation, so there is no need for temporary entry permits. Hereafter, those without permits shall not enter the market, and non-rice merchants shall not trade. If there is any private transfer or borrowing of names, once found, the person in charge of the market shall be responsible for revoking the entry permit and canceling their entry qualifications. The above items should be complied with and reported, and management measures should be drafted and reported to the office for review. This order."

Since it started on February 7, as of February 16, a total of 946 infants have been distributed, and 1,896 pounds of milk powder have been issued. According to regulations, the responsible doctor should first vaccinate and examine the body, and explain the preparation and application methods. According to the survey, most of the parents of these infants are employed as factory and company employees, primary and secondary school teachers, and ordinary merchants. However, the administration hopes that infants in the city who are poor and lack nutrition will apply in large numbers, so as to be universal.

Commercial News

### Rice Prices Rise Uncontrollably: Food Problem for the People is Serious

Subsidized Rice Sold at 18,000 [yuan] per Dan, Jardine Matheson Orders Australian Flour

Yesterday, the rice market saw strong sales, but the supply was limited. Retailers were busy buying from each other in the market, but because supply could not meet demand, prices gradually increased, rising more than 2,000 yuan from the previous day. The situation was extremely chaotic. The Grain Administration Bureau entrusted the same trade to sell indica rice at 18,000 yuan per dan, and retailers competed to buy it, which reduced market transactions. The Relief Administration also sold a large amount of subsidized flour, so although flour rose by 200-300 yuan, people’s hearts were softened. Yellow beans increased by 1,000 yuan, bean cakes by 200 yuan, and wheat bran by 200-300 yuan. The oil market saw strong buying from retailers, and prices jumped by 5,000-6,000 yuan. Cottonseed cakes also increased by 1,000 yuan, and corn rose by 1,000 yuan. It is said that Jardine Matheson is in contact to order a large quantity of Australian flour.

### US Dollar Reaches New High

Yesterday, the US dollar reached a new high because free merchant ships imported goods, and yarn and cotton dealers aggressively bought more. Settlements for American cotton futures were re-established, opening at around 2,080 yuan in the morning and gradually rising to around 2,230 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, because gold trading became more inconvenient, the US dollar was even more sought after by the public, finally reaching a new high of around 2,380 yuan, a total increase of 330 yuan. Hong Kong dollars were also being bought by banks, with old notes rising by 45 yuan and new notes by 17 yuan.

### Government Bonds and Chinese Stocks Rise

Government bonds and Chinese and foreign stocks continue to be traded privately, with only a few deals being made. Category C bonds rose from 1,400 yuan to 1,750 yuan. Miscellaneous brands had less speculative activity and were only considered stable. Compared to the previous close, Categories A and B rose by 100 yuan, Category C by 300 yuan, Category D by 220 yuan, and Category E by 80 yuan. As for Chinese stocks, Wing On Textile rose to 2,250 yuan, American Asiatic to 1,750 yuan, Jingfu to 118 yuan, Xinguang to 110 yuan, and Quanxing to 95 yuan, fluctuating back and forth. Compared to the previous close, each rose by more than 10%. Foreign stocks were even quieter, with only more active inquiries for Jardine Matheson Textile and British & Chinese Corporation. Jardine Matheson Textile rose by 10%, with demand exceeding supply. In the afternoon, prices for all items continued to rise.

### Yarn, Cotton, and Cloth All Rise

Yesterday, the yarn market became even more strong. Double Horse and Blue Phoenix each rose by one level. Double Horse was traded at 1.1 million, and Blue Phoenix was also priced at 1 million. Other brands were also boosted. 42-count double-strand yarn was particularly profitable, trading at 1.95 million, a sharp increase of 200,000 from the previous day. In the afternoon, gold prices rose again, and it was rumored that yarn prices at a certain teahouse continued to rise by 30-50,000, with little supply available.

Yesterday, spot cotton trading showed some improvement, and the market seemed to be tightening. Fangjian Company’s procurement of 42-count American cotton (Middling) increased sharply, with one brand accounting for 600 bales, and Xinsheng also imported 200 bales each of Nanlu, Taicang, and Haihuo machine-picked cotton. In addition, cotton firms also traded with each other, with transaction prices rising by 3,000-4,000 yuan across the board.

As black market speculation frequently reached new highs, the cloth market followed suit, and because customers had slightly increased their appetite, dyeing and weaving factories also aggressively sought plain white fabrics. Moreover, because the dyeing prices for various colored fabrics, shirts, and poplins were about to be adjusted, those holding goods had even more of an excuse [to raise prices].

### Silk and Satin Rise Again

Silk and satin, which had been sluggish for several days, showed a high-flying trend in the market yesterday. 120-count Tianqiao rayon spot goods opened at 2.05 million yuan and rose to close at 2.2 million yuan. In the afternoon, the asking price even reached 2.3 million yuan, 500,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Orders for stack documents were prohibited, and off-market prices were between 1.3 million and 1.4 million yuan. Factory silk trading was quiet, and prices rose with gold. Each grade increased by 50,000 yuan. Qianjing's five-dan head traded at 1.5 million yuan. Flannelette goods also experienced a surge in prices. American Asiatic bedspreads (100 pieces) cost 1.28 million yuan. Dachenggfeng was approximately 4,350 yuan per yard, an increase of 15% compared to the previous day. Linji wax feather yarn rose by 200 yuan per yard.

### Ministry of Food Plans to Loan Money to Purchase Rice

Due to the daily soaring rice prices in Shanghai, the Ministry of Food plans to first issue loans to rice traders, who will send personnel to purchase rice in the surrounding countryside, and then sell it to the Ministry of Food at the purchase price. The Ministry of Food will store the rice in the vaults of the Four Banks [a group of major state-owned banks] to increase rice reserves.

In order to understand the grain prices in various regions, the special commissioner of the Grain Administration stationed in Shanghai has dispatched personnel to Wuxi, Changshu, and other rice-producing areas, as well as Hangzhou and Huzhou (Wuxing), to conduct on-site investigations to adjust grain prices.

### Black Market Speculation Reaches 1.75 Million: Black Market Jumps Higher and Higher

Yesterday, the spirit of speculation was even higher. International news helped buyers. Although it was a case of nervous overreaction and catching shadows based on rumors, the rumors had spread deep into the streets and alleys, with considerable influence. In the afternoon, the public security authorities took emergency measures, and it was rumored that arrests were being made. The trade stopped doing business, and the supply was even smaller. Although demand was sporadic, it was urgent. Transactions were even less transparent, and the source of goods was non-existent. The asking price was extraordinarily high. It was found that it opened in the morning at 1.53 million, hovering around 1.55 million for a long time. Later, as the authorities' inspections became stricter, the market price rose even faster due to the urgent needs of hot money, climbing to around 1.63 million by noon, more than 10% higher than the previous close. In the afternoon, the authorities took action to arrest people. Although demand was strong, it was extremely difficult to find a counterparty. The asking price continued to rise, and people felt even more panicked. After the banks closed, it had reached a new high of around 1.755 million. In addition to banning speculation, the authorities have no fundamental countermeasures. Things are valued according to their scarcity, and the future is unimaginable. Decorative gold has no market. Refined silver is at 1,600, and silver dollars are favored by scattered hot money, soaring to 950 yuan. Hidden interest rates are around two jiao.

### Keemun Tea Stands Out

The tea market situation is generally stable, but Keemun tea has made progress because the inventory on the market is weak, and major sellers insist on not selling, so prices have risen by more than 10,000 yuan.

Spring and Autumn

### Nanyuan (South Garden)

— Shi Jimei

Yesterday, I went to Nanyuan, like a wandering son returning from a foreign land after many years – sorrowful, but not without a hint of sweetness.

The two large black iron gates were still open as before, but the gatekeeper had been replaced by a young man. It suddenly dawned on me that the old Xu of the past, that honest and sincere old man, had been killed by the enemy in the countryside.

And what about the myna bird hanging in the window of the gatehouse? That was old Xu's beloved pet. It would say, "Mr. Luo is here! Mr. Luo is here." Old Xu had taught it that because we would sneak out of the school whenever we had the chance, and Mr. Luo was the director of student affairs, whose name alone made people tremble.

Now, that myna bird is gone. Perhaps, like old Xu who loved it, it had long since left this world.

The gray walls were still unharmed. The leaves had fallen from the few large trees that had survived the disaster. The rough branches that stretched upwards resembled the palms of giants, holding up the dull, gray, cloudy sky that seemed about to fall.

I really regretted coming, especially on such a day, and without one or two of my original friends.

There was no sun. Gray walls, gray school buildings, an extremely gray sky, a gray old place, a gray state of mind upon returning...

In the reception room, I saw Mrs. Sun, the current principal, who was also the wife of the late Principal Jin. She smiled kindly and greeted me warmly to sit down, as if she were seeing a member of her family whom she had not seen for many years.

"You've grown so much taller than before," Mrs. Sun said, "No wonder we're getting old."

"No, you're still the same as before," I told her, but these were not empty words.

"If we met on the street, I would recognize you, but you might not remember who I am, right?"

"How could I not remember?" She shook her head, denying my words. "I can still name a few of your good friends: Sha Li, the Xi sisters..."

"And Madam Youlan Li Qingren, Piqiu Huang Dezheng," I interjected, "We called ourselves the Six Gentlemen."

Mrs. Sun laughed. She was not very clear about many of the interesting things about the "Six Gentlemen." "Qingren is already married. I know she is in Hangzhou. What about the other four? Are they all well?"

I told her about their recent situations. When I mentioned Sha Li's death, we were all filled with emotion. Why did heaven not grant that extremely intelligent girl a longer life?

After that, we talked about many, many other people: Lizhu, Kewen, and Weizhong; and Zhaoming, who she still remembered as the most beautiful and talented in our class.

When we mentioned Ningxiang, we felt even more sorrow than when we mourned Sha Li's death. She is probably still in Chengdu now. In this victorious era, when the war is over, when she mentions the prestige of "dying before realizing one's ambitions," what will she feel? Will she be sad? Happy? Or will she spend her days, feeling neither sad nor happy, in a monotonous routine? And what about her little daughter, Wanghui, who never even met her father? She may already be in kindergarten.

All of this touched Mrs. Sun's heart. She was silent for a long time. Was she thinking about the late Principal Jin? At the beginning of the war, Principal Jin, regardless of his own failing health, busied himself with the school's relocation, enduring so much hardship that he became seriously ill and passed away, leaving behind his wife, his only beloved daughter, and the school he had founded with his own hands. If there had been no war, perhaps Principal Jin would still be alive today.

I deeply regretted my indiscretion and quickly changed the subject.

A burst of light laughter came from the end of the corridor. I wondered which class of girls had just finished their lesson.

I felt that I had been sitting for a long time, so I bid farewell to Mrs. Sun. She urged me to come to Nanyuan again when I had time.

I walked down the stone steps and looked at the general scenery of the garden. I felt a sense of things changing, people remaining the same.

The small bridge, the flowing water, and the artificial mountains were still there, but the plum trees were gone. They must have been cut down by the Japanese soldiers because it is our national flower.

Next to the Chinese holly in front of the window, camellias were in bloom, which had not been there before. Before, there were only the faces of the girls, as beautiful as camellias, and there were many times when people hid here during games of hide-and-seek.

The swing set was still there. Where was Sha Li, who loved to swing?

The thatched pavilion was gone. I remember that on the eve of our parting, we, the "Six Gentlemen," sat there holding candles and talking all night long, until dawn.

Someone came out of the dormitory opposite, a small and delicate figure wearing a green raincoat. She looked so much like Chu Yu back then!

Rain and wind blew past. I could no longer linger.

As I walked out of Nanyuan, I remembered the last time I left this place. It was when the pomegranate flowers were in full bloom, in 1937, half a month before the Lugou Bridge Incident.

More than eight years had passed, a separation that felt like an eternity.

A bell rang, passing through the walls, from inside Nanyuan. I didn't know if it was for the start or end of class. The sound seemed both unfamiliar and familiar. After several years of occupation by the enemy army and repeated relocations of the school, this bell must not have been the same bell as before, and the person ringing the bell must have been replaced. The girls listening to this bell for class must not have been the same girls as before. However, this sound, this clear and resonant sound, whether it came from the original bell or the current bell, whether it was rung by whomsoever, and whether it was rung for whomever, its meaning remained the same forever. It was forever the same, telling and instructing people to study, rest, work, rest...

Therefore, I thought of Principal Jin, who was exhausted in mind and body, and of Mrs. Sun, who inherited Principal Jin's will and enthusiastically ran the school. I believed that today, the bells of Nanyuan would continue to ring forever.

I walked further and further away, but the sound of the bell, the clear and resonant sound, still rang in my ears, forever, forever...

### The Shoe Shiner

— Ren Jun

-- One of Street Ballads

An old and broken box,

A few boxes of yellow and black shoe polish,

A brush,

A few wiping cloths…

These are all his tools,

These are all his belongings.

Customers stretch their feet over,

And he uses quick and skilled methods,

Bowing his head, carefully brushing, brushing, brushing…

Like a beauty-loving young lady

Caring for her face,

Or like an artist

Facing his canvas.

But when he shines other people's shoes

So that they are smooth and shiny,

His own face and hands,

His whole body…

Have already become dirty and black!

### Double Flying (16)

— Zhao Qingge

Master Mo valued Lihua too much, and from that time on, he began to teach her to read. But Madam Mo objected, saying: Girls don't need books, "Lack of talent is a virtue." Master Mo disagreed. Although he did not dare to protest openly, he continued to fulfill his teaching duties in secret. Lihua was very smart, and she could remember everything Master Mo taught her once. She loved to read and did not like to play very much. She held a copy of the "Thousand Character Classic" tightly in her hands and kept reciting it.

Bao Ling was now sixteen years old! Two years ago, Master Mo sent him to a junior high school to study, because Master Mo understood that the old things were over and that new things should be pursued. Bao Ling was very grateful to Master Mo for giving him this opportunity. Without Master Mo, he would not be able to catch up with the times and keep up with the progress of the times.

Master Mo placed all his hopes on his children and did his best to cultivate them. As for himself, he continued to take a resigned attitude. He no longer had any fantasies, nor did he have any unreasonable demands. He was gradually weakening and growing old!

Madam Mo was still as healthy as ever, still dominating the family! And she still did not get along well with Master Mo. She also loved Lihua, but when she saw Lihua often being attracted to Master Mo, she became jealous. She hated Master Mo for dividing the children's feelings for her. She remembered that Lihua had cried the first time she saw Master Mo, and at that time she thought that Lihua and Master Mo were not meant to be together, and that she disliked Master Mo. But now it was different. Master Mo would use books to tempt her, just as he had tempted Bao Ling before, and one by one they all became estranged from Madam Mo, leaving Madam Mo with nothing. Therefore, she swore that she would never have another child. She said: "I plant the trees, and others come to enjoy the shade. This is unfair." So she dogmatically believed that children should belong to her. They had argued many times about this issue.

"You can make the children ignore me!"

Master Mo once used this excuse on Madam Mo. But in his heart, he quietly said:

"As long as you have the power to control the children."

"Just stop using those broken books to lure them!"

"But, this is my responsibility as a father," Master Mo said with confidence.

"Responsibility?" Madam Mo looked at him with wide eyes. "The responsibility of a father is to raise them, but you bring the money!" After Madam Mo finished speaking, she stretched out her hands to Master Mo.

### Social Service Blood - Courageous Young Woman - Arrives in Shanghai with Special Study - Inquiring about Nursing School Enrollment Procedures

Mr. Editor: You are concerned with all of humanity's problems, providing the highest level of social service, and are friends of mankind. Now, I need to trouble you to answer two pressing issues, and I hope you can inform me. I am from Sichuan. Five years ago, due to circumstances, I married someone who was not ideal. My husband is a typical warlord. Although I have ample food and clothing, I am not satisfied with mere material comfort. I want to create a life according to my own wishes. Therefore, taking advantage of the restored transportation, I ventured here alone last month. During the journey, I endured all kinds of human suffering, experiencing cold and war I had never known before! But I still do not regret it. I intend to work here and study at night. However, my relatives told me that I must wait for an opportunity. I have been waiting here for ten days now, and I still have to wait. Day after day passes. How can my current situation allow me to wait long? Before I succeed in my work, my heart is so anxious!

Second, I have a child who is almost four years old. I must first send her to a nursery. Are there any nurseries here? Where are they located?
