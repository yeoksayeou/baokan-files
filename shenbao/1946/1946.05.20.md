### National Army Recaptures Siping Street Yesterday Morning; Communist Forces East of Chengde Blocked; New Turn of Events in Shenyang-Changchun Situation

[Report from this newspaper's office in Shenyang, 19th] Siping Street, gradually advanced upon by the National Army over the past month, was recovered at 8:00 AM on the 19th, marking another new turn of events in the situation between Shenyang and Changchun. When the news reached Shenyang, various newspapers released special editions, sparking a new perspective among the people. Siping City, formerly established under the puppet Manchukuo regime, has a municipal area of 203,606 square kilometers and a population of over 60,000. Railways radiate in all directions, connecting to Korea in the east, controlling the gateway to Mongolia in the west, and connected by the north-south Chinese Changchun Railway. Coupled with the province's abundant agricultural production, Siping City has become virtually the premier agricultural market in southern Northeast China. Its primary products are soybeans, and it is also a major oil and chemical industry base, with numerous oil mills, as well as flour, wine, and cement factories. Siping is indeed a crucial hub for transportation, industry, and economy.

[United Press, Nanjing, 19th] According to news from local newspapers: The National Army successfully launched a flanking maneuver against the left-wing positions of the Communist forces in the Siping Street area, and has already approached Lishu, northwest of the city. Fierce battles are currently underway to seize the hills northeast of the city.

[French Press Agency, Nanjing, 18th] A government army spokesperson stated today, regarding the situation in Northeast China, that he could neither confirm nor deny reports of a government army offensive against Siping Street in the near future, but implicitly acknowledged that the government army was continuing its attack on the city and subjecting it to heavy bombardment. Meanwhile, a Communist spokesperson firmly asserted that Siping Street was still being defended. The efforts of the government army's elite winter forces have been to no avail. The spokesperson confirmed that hundreds of buildings in the city have been destroyed by bombardment, and civilian losses are heavy, but the Communist forces under General Lin Biao are determined to hold on to the end.

[Report from this newspaper's office in Nanjing, 19th] Late news: The Communist forces advancing eastward from Chifeng, Rehe Province, have been blocked east of Chengde by the elite National Army. The Communist forces are drawing troops from Hebei and Chahar provinces to reinforce Rehe, with the aim of reversing the declining situation in Siping Street and Benxi in Northeast China, but it is too late. Furthermore, after the National Army in Liaobei recovered Xifeng, both flanks have made progress. The morale of the National Army in Northeast China is very high. It is reported that when Bai Chongxi and Sun Liren inspected the front lines, they expressed great satisfaction with the discipline of the National Army. The mission of Generals Bai and Sun to Northeast China is not, as the Communists claim, to launch a general offensive, but their primary mission is to assess the effectiveness of military education in Northeast China. Over the past two weeks, the Communist forces have used various methods to wage a psychological war against the National Army, employing methods of broadcasting and distributing leaflets from aircraft, much like the "Lord Haw-Haw" used by Germany. However, the loyal and brave National Army has remained unmoved, because the National Army in Northeast China has clearly recognized that their goal of recovering Changchun is to reclaim national sovereignty, and anyone who dares to obstruct them is a national traitor. Only with Changchun returned to the nation will any negotiations in Nanjing have a legitimate and reasonable resolution.

### Communist Forces Launch Wide-Ranging Attacks on Jiaoji Railway; Dispatch Large Forces to Attack Jinan; Their Intention is to Force the Government to Make Another Concession; Communist Forces Seize Mingyong Station; Towns Still in National Army Hands

[Report from this newspaper's office in Jinan, 19th] Based on various recent signs, it is judged that the Communist forces have clearly adopted a strategy of gradually encircling Jinan. General military observers believe that the Communist forces' wide-ranging attacks on the Jiaoji Railway in recent days should not be seen as a prelude to a formal civil war. The Communist forces' objective is still harassment, in order to strengthen the Communist Party representatives' position in military mediation negotiations, attempting to force the government to make another concession. However, the Communist forces are actively preparing for civil war, which is a fact.

[Report from this newspaper's office in Jinan, 18th] Mingshui Station was occupied by the Communist forces, but most of Mingshui Town is still in the hands of the National Army. The Communist forces launched a fierce attack at night, only occupying a corner. Fierce street fighting took place in the town throughout the 18th. The Jinan Group went to mediate on the 18th, but after reaching Guodian, they could not proceed due to damaged railway tracks and bridges. Government representatives are negotiating to proceed on foot to investigate the truth. On the 18th, coal and grain prices in Jinan soared. He Siyuan flew to Nanjing immediately.

[Report from this newspaper's office in Qingdao, 18th] The wide-ranging attacks by Communist forces on the Jiaoji Railway east of Jinan are reported to be a planned operation. The Communist forces are still continuously mobilizing large forces, claiming that they will soon attack Jinan.

[Report from this newspaper's office in Jinan, 18th] From the night of the 17th, the Communist forces carried out large-scale massacres in more than ten villages in Zhonggongbao, south of Jinan City. No able-bodied men were spared, and some entire families were killed, a truly appalling scene. The Jinan Group walked more than ten li east from Guodian to Shijiazhuang to meet with the Communist battalion commander. Because the Communist forces had no responsible person present, the government representatives, including Wen Ze, drafted four proposals: to immediately cease the conflict, repair transportation, and return prisoners and weapons. The proposals were handed over to the battalion commander to forward to Liao Ronglin. On the evening of the 18th, they returned to Jinan and decided to fly to Linyi on the 20th to meet with Chen Yi to discuss a comprehensive solution. The Pacification Headquarters and the Shandong Provincial Government also sent personnel to accompany them.

[Report from this newspaper's office in Qingdao, 18th] The fighting in various places along the Jiaoji Railway east of Jinan is still continuing. The Jinan Executive Group will proceed to the conflict zone immediately to prepare for mediation.

[United Press, Qingdao, 18th] According to the headquarters of the 3rd Marine Brigade of the U.S. Marine Corps: The strength of the Communist forces in Shandong Province is two to one compared to the National Army. If the Communist forces decide to act, they could occupy the entire province within a month. It is claimed that there are 300,000 well-armed Communist troops in Shandong Province, while the National Army has only 150,000. Brigadier General Clemen told a United Press reporter that he believed that the Communist forces had deployed their troops in extremely advantageous locations throughout the province, allowing them to do as they please. He stated that the situation in Shandong depends on the outcome of General Marshall's negotiations.

[Special dispatch from this newspaper's office in Jinan, 18th] From the 15th, Zhuzhuang defense area in Gaotang County has been under fierce attack by more than 4,000 Communist forces for three days. Internal and external communications have been cut off. The defending forces are fighting bloody battles, with heavy casualties. Now they have run out of food and ammunition.

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 18th] The Communist forces are currently mobilizing the First and Second Brigades of the Communist forces and a part of the Central Shandong Military Region from the Zibo area, gathering near Tai'an, with a total force of ten regiments, showing signs of invading Tai'an.

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 18th] A motorcade of 14 vehicles of the Jinpu Railway Bureau transporting relief supplies, carrying 30 tons of relief flour from Gaomi to Zhangdian, stopped in Zhangdian due to continuous rain. On the 16th, when they returned to Gaomi, carrying 500 Japanese expatriates being repatriated, they were intercepted by the Communist forces in Yidu, and all vehicles and drivers and assistants were detained. Relief sub-bureau and railway bureau escorts were driven back to Zhangdian.

### Tianjin and Beijing Very Tense; Communist Forces Enter Mentougou

[United Press, Beijing, 19th] Today, because it was heard that the Communist forces had entered Mentougou, 17 miles west of Beijing, the situation inside the city became very tense. Sandbags have been piled up outside various military facilities. A senior government official soothed the public, claiming that there was no need to panic, but after nightfall, the police closed the gates of the inner city, questioned passersby, searched hotels, and increased patrols at important locations.

[United Press, Tianjin, 19th] In the announcement of the Security Team's recovery of Liu'anzhuang, Tianjin citizens today learned for the first time in the Ta Kung Pao that Communist forces or irregulars were only five miles from Tianjin. It was also learned that some locations 15 to 20 miles west and northwest of Tianjin have been retaken from the Communist forces.

[Report from this newspaper's office in Beijing, 19th] Liujiakou, east of Baoding, was attacked last night by more than 600 Communist forces. After two hours of fierce fighting, the Communist forces retreated. The National Army pursued them and discovered suspicious new graves along the way, from which more than 200 landmines were excavated. Also, Zhujiazhuang, south of Baoding, was attacked by the Communist forces at midnight this morning. Due to being outnumbered, dozens of National Army soldiers were captured, and they are still under siege. At the same time, the power lines in that area have been largely destroyed.

### Gaoling Station Recovered; Railway Under Repair

[Central News Agency, Beijing, 19th] According to a phone call from Shanhaiguan, Gaoling Station and other places east of Qian Suo Station on the Yujin section of the Beining Railway have been recovered by the National Army.

The Railway Bureau has dispatched a repair team to rush the repairs, which are expected to be completed by the 19th. Since the National Army repaired Qian Suo Station on the Yujin section outside Shanhaiguan on May 8, there have been no changes in recent days.

### Ceasefire Order at Xuanhuadian Signed and Sent for Compliance

[Report from this newspaper's office in Beijing, 19th] The 32nd Executive Group of the Military Mediation Department held a meeting in Xuanhuadian on the 12th and resolved the Xuanzi No. 1 order, stating: "It is reported that there are troop movements and military conflicts. These incidents are reported to be in the area west and south of the Hekou and Huangpi to Dachengtze, Yangjiahe, and Jiangmuyan. Before this group investigates the military conflict, all troops should immediately cease fire and withdraw to the positions before January 23 of this year, the date of the 'Luoshan Agreement'. This order takes effect immediately upon arrival." The above order has been signed by representatives of all three parties and sent to the command headquarters of the National and Communist armies in the area.

### Food Supply to Shenyang Blocked; Rao Shushi Uninterested in Repatriation of Japanese POWs

[Report from this newspaper's office in Shenyang, 17th] Amidst the gloomy situation in the Northeast, the people of Shenyang and other cities are greatly troubled by the lack of food and high prices due to the blocking of food supplies. The work of the Three-Person Group has been stalled for a long time. On the 17th, U.S. Colonel Pan Lin of the Military Mediation Department went to Siping Street and then to Changchun to negotiate with the Communist side on the issue of repatriating Japanese prisoners of war in the areas controlled by the Communist forces. This reporter specifically asked Mr. Rao Shushi, the leader of the Communist side of the Three-Person Group, for his opinion on this matter. According to Rao, he is not interested in this issue because the Japanese prisoners of war in the areas controlled by the Communist forces have already been transported away. As for Japanese expatriates, a temporary policy of dealing with them can be adopted. Currently, there are larger issues than repatriating Japanese expatriates that have not yet been addressed, and this move is putting the cart before the horse. He also said that it is not very difficult to repatriate Japanese expatriates in the Northeast, and in the future, they can be sent to Korea, which would be much more convenient. As for opening up food supplies, as long as there is a good solution, it should not be a problem.

### Communist Forces Launch General Offensive; Marshall's Peace Efforts Greatly Threatened

[Special dispatch from this newspaper's office in Nanjing, 19th] According to neutral figures close to both government and Communist representatives: Based on the current situation, the only effective way to resolve the current crisis is a ceasefire. If we use the method of negotiating while fighting to eliminate disputes, it is no different than climbing a tree to catch fish. We should recognize the mission of the upcoming Comprehensive Group Meeting and place high hopes on it, because this group meeting will conduct sincere consultations on three important topics: the number of National Congress representatives, the reorganization of the government, and the review of the draft constitution, in order to establish fair and reasonable resolutions so that the National Assembly can be convened as soon as possible to discuss and decide on the constitution, reorganize the government, and achieve the goal of unity and unification, rebuild the Republic of China, and usher in a peaceful and prosperous era. However, to ensure the smooth progress and satisfactory results of the Comprehensive Group Meeting, the flames of war that have been raging across the country must be extinguished quickly, because the smell of gunpowder from the battlefield, once it permeates the conference hall, will be enough to provoke either side and lead to a deadlock. Based on the various signs of the past week, it is believed that Special Envoy Marshall has already considered this point carefully and will use his outstanding wisdom to promote the parallel progress of the two major tasks of "military mediation" and "political negotiation," hoping to prevent the flames that have already been ignited from spreading again. Judging from past experience, the prospects for the success of "military mediation" are very slim. If we make a judgment based on the current complex situation in Northeast China, Rehe, and North China, then the hope is extremely slim. However, Special Envoy Marshall does not hesitate to use words and tirelessly strives for mediation, indicating that behind-the-scenes news has clearly shown that Special Envoy Marshall's work is indeed heading towards failure, and it is believed that the situation will have a major development when the Comprehensive Group Meeting is held.

[Report from this newspaper's office in Nanjing, 19th] It is reported that Democratic League representatives Huang Yanpei, Zhang Junmai, Liang Shuming, and Zhang Bojun have temporarily postponed their trip to Nanjing.

The Youth Party is willing to work together with the Democratic League and social figures to save the current crisis and promote peaceful reunification. It is reported that Chang plans to return to Shanghai in the coming days to exchange views with various parties.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 19th] It was learned here today: Communist troops are threatening General Marshall's peace efforts, have launched a general offensive in Rehe, Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, and northern Jiangsu. The Communist troops operating in Rehe are estimated to have seventeen brigades and have allegedly occupied Beipiao, sixty miles northwest of Jinzhou, threatening Chaoyang and Pingzhuang.

Communist troops in eastern Hebei are currently bombarding Cangxian, the gateway to Tianjin, while in western Hebei they are besieging Shijiazhuang, and Dongming in southern Hebei is also under siege. The situation in Jinan, Shandong Province is critical, with Communist troops advancing westward along the Jiaoji Railway through Mingshui, Longshan, Guodian, and Shilipu.

Now that Zhu has returned to the country, the committee held its first meeting in the Ministry of Education since returning to the capital on the 18th of this month to hear the report. It was reported that more than 100 boxes of books belonging to the Central Library that were left in Hong Kong before the war and transported to Japan by the Japanese have been ordered to be returned by MacArthur's headquarters in Tokyo and are currently being inventoried, with repatriation expected within two months. In addition, objects excavated by the Japanese in Anyang and Zhoukoudian will also be returned soon. MacArthur has ordered the Japanese government to prohibit the export of all cultural relics. For cultural relics illegally obtained by Japan in various places since the July 7th Incident, the Japanese government has also been ordered to compile a list and submit it by June 1st. Mr. Li has visited various public and private cultural relic collections in Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto. MacArthur's headquarters has stated that all Chinese cultural relics plundered or illegally purchased by Japan may be returned, but concrete proof must be provided. The committee now intends to propose to the Far Eastern Commission in Washington to advance the deadline for seeking compensation for cultural relics to the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895. At the same time, it is rushing to compile a catalog of important cultural relics lost during the war to be submitted to MacArthur's headquarters. However, many of the letters of registered losses received by the committee from various parties lack concrete descriptions and accurate evidence, causing many difficulties during the investigation and negotiation. Applicants are requested to pay special attention.

### Yunnan Provincial Garrison Headquarters Cracks Down on Bandits in Kunming

[Our Correspondent, Kunming, 18th] The Yunnan Provincial Garrison Headquarters cracked down on organized bandits in Kunming on the 16th and 17th, arresting more than 30 key criminals. They are currently intensifying their efforts to arrest accomplices in order to fully solve the case and maintain security in Yunnan. It is reported that these bandits are scattered in several counties near Yunnan and along transportation lines, with Kunming as their main base. The robberies that have occurred in Kunming in recent months are all related to them. The Garrison Headquarters discovered clues to their activities and secretly sent skilled intelligence personnel to infiltrate them, even collaborating with them in two small robberies. It was learned that each person had to pay 20,000 yuan, provide their own pistol, and be able to provide vehicles to facilitate their activities. It is rumored that their numbers have now expanded to more than 300. After carrying out several major robberies, they planned to purchase large quantities of guns, ammunition, and vehicles, and then retreat into the mountains to establish a base. On the evening of the planned robbery, the bandits gathered in a teahouse on Wenlin Street. The Garrison Headquarters believed that the time to crack the case had come, so it dispatched a large number of plainclothes officers and soldiers to lie in ambush nearby. The jeep that the bandits were traveling in was driven by an intelligence officer secretly sent by the Garrison Headquarters. When the car reached the ambush line, the driver used the excuse of a flat tire to ask the bandits to get out of the car and push it. Upon a prearranged signal, the area was surrounded from all sides. The bandits opened fire to resist arrest, and the bandit leader, Liu [illegible], was killed on the spot. The rest were captured, and several submachine guns and pistols were seized. The headquarters immediately conducted a night interrogation and, based on their confessions, followed the clues and arrested the relevant criminals one after another. Upon hearing the news, the citizens were greatly relieved. The Commander-in-Chief, Kui Xing, specially allocated 700,000 yuan to reward those involved.

### Suzhou County Government Holds Emergency Meeting to Discuss Relief for Civil Servants; Decides to Raise 2,000 Shi of White Rice for Emergency Relief

[Our Correspondent, Suzhou, 19th] The price of rice in this county was still around 50,000 yuan the day before yesterday, but yesterday it suddenly broke through 60,000, and today it is approaching 70,000. This kind of rise is unprecedented. Salaried workers and petty merchants are facing starvation, and the crisis is causing anxiety all day long. The social unrest is at an extreme point. In particular, civil servants, police, and security personnel have exhausted all means of raising money and are borrowing without success. They are serving the public with empty stomachs and are on the verge of collapse. Following the general strike of colleagues at the Suzhou High Court, all police officers of the County Police Department are also planning to request a uniform long leave today. The cadres and staff of the county government's various departments have already expressed their intention to strike yesterday. It is truly impossible for them to endure the tumultuous waves of these prices, as personal integrity cannot overcome the crying of wives and children due to hunger and cold.

### Distribution of Comfort Money for Families of Resistance Fighters: Chongqing Has Already Distributed, Beijing Will Start Soon

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] Wu Zijian, Director of the Fuxu (Comfort and Relief) Committee Office, has arrived in Beijing from Chongqing. Speaking to reporters about the distribution of comfort money after the victory, he said that the committee, upholding the wishes of Chairman Chiang, has repeatedly increased the amount of comfort money for wounded and disabled soldiers and families of those killed in action during the war, due to the rising wartime price index. This has significantly benefited the wounded and families of the deceased. Since the victory against the enemy and their surrender, another special comfort money and victory comfort money have been approved for distribution. For example, the family of a deceased private can receive a total of 55,500 yuan, and the family of a deceased major can receive a total of 155,000 yuan. Chongqing began distributing on May 1st. As of my departure from Chongqing, over 100 million yuan had been distributed. Beijing will start distributing immediately.

It was said that no orders had been received yet. However, the committee's work is more important after the war than during the war. During the eight years of resistance, four to five million soldiers were wounded or killed. Due to transportation difficulties and personnel relocation, only over 500,000 people have applied for comfort money. The rest will be actively handled after the return to normal. Moreover, the comfort period is 20 years, which cannot be stopped immediately. Once Director He returns to Beijing after inspection, he will ask the Chairman for instructions.

Editorial

### Please, New Mayor, Suppress and Stabilize Rice Prices!

The new Mayor of Shanghai, Mr. Wu Guozhen, takes office today. We welcome the new Mayor, and at the same time, we have expectations of the new Mayor!

Today, what threatens Shanghai citizens the most are high prices and frequent labor unrest, and the soaring rice prices are the most critical key to this. The first major thing for Mayor Wu to do upon taking office is to suppress and stabilize rice prices. This is the central issue to solve all problems. Mayor Wu said that he only knows how to do practical things for the citizens and does not like empty talk and propaganda. We welcome this statement, and we especially expect him to first do well the major thing of "suppressing and stabilizing rice prices" for the citizens.

The recent soaring rice prices, suddenly breaking through the 60,000 mark, not only frightens the common people but also threatens all Shanghai citizens with starvation. "Food is the most important thing for the people, and rice prices are the benchmark for all prices; soaring rice prices will inevitably become the biggest factor in causing social unrest." The soaring rice prices can indeed be excused by the food shortage, but the rice reserves in the city are not necessarily sharply reduced, so why is it rising so much day after day? The artificial factor in this must account for a very large proportion. Unfortunately, the municipal authorities, because the transition is imminent, are kicking the ball regarding the troublemaking in the rice market, only standing by and watching. Rice weevils are taking advantage of the opportunity, and what else can the people say!

We analyze the reason for this rice price surge, which is purely an artificial panic. Shanghai is a city full of hot money. Because the national industry is exhausted and unable to rise, the hot money has no proper outlet and is creating evil in society, which has not been a day or two. It is rumored that recently a few tycoons have organized a rice-buying company, scouring food rice warehouse receipts in the market and deliberately raising prices. It is also said that those with political intentions are also using the extorted legal tender to disrupt the rice market in Jiangnan. These people have the same hearts as speculative rice merchants, only fearing that rice prices will not rise, and can truly be said to "deserve to die." They have bullied the weakness of the authorities in the past, repeatedly showing off their tricks. First, they said that Shanghai has a small amount of rice reserves and requested a loan to purchase grain. Then, the grain loan was issued, but the price rose instead, so they blamed the grain loan for causing trouble and coerced the authorities to stop the loan to purchase grain. Finally, they took advantage of the reorganization of the municipal government to compete for warehouse receipts and greatly raise their prices. This is completely deliberately joking with the government and making enemies of the common people. The new Mayor should give these social monsters a "three fires upon arrival"!

According to the investigation and statistics of grain experts, the rice reserves in Shanghai are still quite sufficient. The amount of rice stored in rice shops and warehouses is considerable, enough for current needs. If there is no crazy company hoarding and manipulating the market, then there will be no panic and no soaring rice prices. Therefore, in addition to asking the Mayor to severely punish the rice monsters, we must also ask the people to respond calmly and do not panic. Everyone should not rush to buy rice and "add fuel to the fire," causing rice prices to continue to soar. At the same time, we must also request the municipal authorities to immediately investigate the total amount of rice in all rice shops and warehouses in the city, set a deadline for registration, so that they can be strictly controlled and implement "grain rationing according to population." Then, based on Mayor Wu's past diplomatic experience, he should do his best to negotiate with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) and the United Kingdom, the United States, Siam, and Vietnam to import a large amount of foreign rice to relieve China's food shortage.

### The Yoshida Cabinet of Japan

The weak and difficult-to-produce Yoshida cabinet of Japan may be born in a few days after a few days of pain. As of the time of this article's publication, the list of cabinet members has not yet been published; what has been decided is that, in addition to Prime Minister Yoshida concurrently serving as Minister of Foreign Affairs, there are only Minister of Finance Ishibashi Tanzan, Minister of Justice Iwata Chuzo, Minister of Transportation Hiraoka Tsunejiro, and Ministers of State Kijuro Shidehara and Saito Takao, and Uehara Etsujiro; the remaining cabinet members are still being negotiated. Looking at the lineup, most of them are Japanese conservatives, which can simply be said to be an extension of the Shidehara cabinet, which has aroused dissatisfaction from various leftist parties and factions in Japan; even in our country's public opinion, it is unanimously believed that even if the Yoshida cabinet is born, it may not be long-lived.

In observing today's Japanese politics, we must not forget that Japan is the culprit of World War II and should bear the major responsibility for poisoning mankind. In today's post-war era, while countries do not have to adopt a policy of revenge and severe punishment toward Japan, they must effectively control it to ensure that its aggressive forces cannot be revived and become a threat to world peace again. In order for the post-war world to enter an era of peace and democracy, democratic countries have unanimously recognized that it is necessary to start with transforming Japanese politics. However, today's Japanese politics are tens of millions of miles away from the ideals and goals we hold.

First, although the Japanese people have gone through this surrender and accepted the joint control of the Allied powers, they still do not admit that they are a defeated country in their hearts, and they have not given up their ambitions, thinking that as long as they are given time, they can make a comeback. This mentality is very common. At the same time, the stubborn thinking of the Japanese people has not changed due to this defeat. The poison of aggressive thinking and militarism is almost deeply rooted in the minds of the Japanese people. Especially those young people still cherish the old dream of "Hakkō ichiu," are obsessed with the idea that defeat is temporary and control is superficial, and that there is a possibility of making a comeback soon. At the beginning of last month, some Japanese "patriotic men of ambition" were secretly working underground, carrying out organized sabotage against the Allied forces. This is enough to show that the Allied powers' work of transforming Japan and eliminating aggressive thinking has not been effective.

Second, Japanese politics have not truly embarked on the path of democratization. The fundamental reason why the Japanese warlords were able to launch a war of aggression regardless of public opinion was that Japanese politics were undemocratic, and political power was manipulated by a small number of warlords, bureaucrats, and capitalists. On the surface, it has the prototype of British and American-style parliamentary politics, but in essence, it is a completely anti-democratic fascist regime. The rulers can act arbitrarily and do not need to seek public opinion. After the war, the Allied powers' control over Japan was intended to make Japanese politics embark on the road of democratization, but in the past nine months, has Japanese politics embarked on this road? It is certainly impossible to make a hasty judgment, but looking at the results of the Japanese general election in mid-April of this year, the Liberal Party occupied 139 seats in the Japanese parliament, the Social Democratic Party 93 seats, the Progressive Party 91 seats, the Concord Party 16 seats, the Communist Party 5 seats, and non-partisan factions 84 seats, which makes us have to be greatly disappointed. Because we know that the so-called Liberal Party is a substitute for the Seiyukai, and the Progressive Party is a substitute for the Minseito. These two major parties have been playing the main role on the Japanese political stage for nearly a century, and in theory, they should bear great responsibility for this war. However, in post-war Japanese politics, they are still allowed to occupy a very important position, changing the soup but not the medicine, only changing a sign. How can we hope that Japanese politics will embark on the right track of democratization?

After the results of the general election were announced, the Shidehara cabinet should have stepped down long ago, allowing the leader of the Liberal Party, Ichiro Hatoyama, to take over and form a cabinet. However, Hatoyama was dismissed. Not only did his dream of becoming Prime Minister fail to come true, but he also lost the leadership of the Liberal Party. The political situation was turbulent and there was no successor, but Shidehara would step down sooner or later. Finally, he came up with a way to resurrect the dead: to discover new figures, secretly contact Yoshida, advocate the merger of the Liberal Party and the Progressive Party, and have Yoshida form a cabinet, while he himself would still be pulling the strings behind the scenes, directing everything. Although his method was approved by MacArthur, the coalition cabinet organized by the two parties, which was full of conservative colors, was not only inherently deficient and difficult to produce, but would inevitably be short-lived due to acquired maladjustment, even if it did not miscarry. The serious problems faced by the Yoshida cabinet are countless, the most important of which are the following:

(1) The opposition of the people. At present, no one in the Japanese people does not believe that the Yoshida cabinet is an extension of the Shidehara cabinet and has unanimously expressed opposition; especially the Social Democratic Party, which is determined to fight the conservative faction to the end. The Yoshida cabinet cannot ignore the opposition of the democratic camp.

(2) The seriousness of the food shortage problem. The most pressing crisis in Japan today is the increasingly serious food shortage problem. If the Yoshida cabinet can shoulder this heavy burden and prevent the Japanese people from being threatened by famine, then its future is still promising. Therefore, he has repeatedly considered the candidate for Minister of Agriculture, and even did not hesitate to visit the Teikoku University professor Seiichi Tohata three times to ask him to take the position, but "a clever woman cannot cook without rice," and he firmly declined. This problem has also become the main reason for the difficult birth of the Yoshida cabinet.

(3) The constitutional issue, including the issue of the Emperor's survival. According to the gist of the Allied powers' control over Japan, it is necessary to make Japanese politics embark on the right track of democratization, and it goes without saying that a new constitution must be drafted. However, regarding the issue of the Emperor's survival, the Japanese are divided, with those in favor and those opposed each accounting for half. Therefore, how to mediate so as to obtain a satisfactory solution is a very difficult problem.

(4) The cooperation between the Liberal Party and the Progressive Party is temporary, not permanent. How can the Yoshida cabinet stay in its position? What's more, the backers supporting these two parties have already fallen, and the Mitsui and Mitsubishi financial groups no longer exist. Who will support the economy in the future?

In short, the Yoshida cabinet is inherently deficient, weak and difficult to produce, and with the current difficulties piled up, it is difficult to have a bright future!

### Byrnes to Broadcast Speech Today: Reports on Detailed Process of Foreign Ministers Conference. Byrnes Immediately Visited Truman After Returning to Washington and Had a Long Talk. Believes Conference Was Not a Complete Failure on Treaty Issues

[US Information Service, Washington, 18th] US Secretary of State Byrnes returned to the US from Paris today and immediately discussed with President Truman for two hours. Byrnes has not yet made any public statements, but said he will broadcast a speech on the 20th to report on the Foreign Ministers Conference. Other members of the US delegation attending the Foreign Ministers Conference have also returned to the US. However, Assistant Secretary of State Dunn is still staying in Paris to continue discussions with those who have not returned home on behalf of the US, in order to resolve some issues before the Four Foreign Ministers meet again on June 15th. Senator Connally, after returning to the US, immediately convened a press conference, saying that although the Foreign Ministers Conference was not as satisfactory and complete as expected, he believes that this conference has paved the way for the gradual resolution of the next conference. The achievements of the Foreign Ministers Conference are still considerably far from our hopes, but there has been progress, and therefore the next conference (June 15th) will be considerably helpful when discussing treaty issues again. Connally also said: He will report to the Senate on the 22nd on the Foreign Ministers Conference. On the same day, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee (of which he is chairman) will also convene a meeting to hear and discuss his report. Senator Vandenberg also plans to report to Congress on the 21st on his thoughts on the Foreign Ministers Conference.

[United Press, Washington, 19th] Byrnes said today that the Foreign Ministers Conference cannot be said to have been a complete failure in resolving treaty issues. According to some sources, Byrnes may have reported to the President that the results of the conference were not as bad as they appeared on the surface. If given time to discuss the various European treaties, such as those of Germany, the US, Soviet Union, Britain and France can reach a consensus. Byrnes is not as pessimistic as when he first left for Paris on the 23rd of last month. He deeply feels that he should make every effort to end the situation left over from the war in Europe as soon as possible. Except for Germany, the occupying forces of all countries should be withdrawn, and the European peace conference should not be delayed too much.

US Secretary of State Byrnes (right), Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov (center), and British Foreign Secretary Bevin (left) all smiled when they arrived in Paris.

### Anglo-American-Soviet Public Opinion Mutually Accuses Each Other, Each Shifting Blame for the Failure of the Foreign Ministers Conference

The Soviets Claim Britain and America are Attempting Atomic Diplomacy

[Reuters, Moscow, 19th] Less than twelve hours after Molotov returned from the Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference in Paris, "New Times" magazine published seven unusually harsh essays and one editorial, criticizing the foreign policies of Britain and America, accusing them of using "atomic weapon diplomacy," and blaming the British and American delegations for deliberately making things difficult for the Soviet Union in international conferences, refusing to accept solutions that the Soviet Union and small countries could agree to. One of these articles, signed by Taikin, raised a series of questions, pointing to the growing unemployment crisis in the United States and the US government's ambition to acquire military bases as proof of the hypocrisy of Anglo-American democracy. Another article, signed by Zhukov, criticized the attitudes of Byrnes and Bevin at the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference, stating that they were not premised on international security, lasting peace, or the protection of the interests of small countries. The article also stated that in recent months, Anglo-American diplomacy had abandoned the attitude of equal cooperation and mutual understanding with other countries, and was attempting a policy of force and atomic diplomacy.

[United Press, London, 18th] Moscow Radio today broadcast "New Times" magazine articles, accusing Britain and America of using the resolutions of the San Francisco Conference "solely for their own interests" and drawing attention to the "dangerous new trends" being discovered in Anglo-American foreign policy. The report recalled the military and political cooperation that existed between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union during the war but claimed that international reactionary forces are now conspiring to overturn the edifice of peace and security that has yet to solidify.

British Newspapers Entirely Blame the Soviet Union

[Agence France-Presse, London, 18th] Political figures here, reviewing the situation resulting from the adjournment of the Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference, are not very enthusiastic but express calmness. They believe that the Paris conference was like a "football match" where no one scored, and it was hastily ended but could be resumed on June 15th without any party losing face. At the same time, British newspapers are entirely blaming the Soviet Union for the failure of the Foreign Ministers Conference. Various newspapers have given reasons to believe that the Soviet Union maintained a "tough" attitude. Anti-Soviet newspapers accuse the Soviet Union of merely delaying time in order to complete the organization of the Soviet occupied zone behind the "Iron Curtain" in Eastern Europe. Newspapers with a more moderate attitude towards the Soviet Union believe that the Soviet delegation underestimated the importance of certain major events to the Anglo-Saxon countries.

The Soviets Claim Britain and America are Attempting Atomic Diplomacy

[US Information Service, San Francisco, 18th] American newspapers have recently written articles commenting on the adjournment of the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference. Most newspapers express regret that the diplomats failed to reach agreement on key issues. However, the New York Times stated that the conference was not entirely fruitless thanks to the active leadership of Secretary of State Byrnes. The newspaper published this opinion because Byrnes strongly advocated that the foreign ministers should continue negotiations on June 15th. An editorial in the New York World-Telegram and Scripps-Howard newspapers stated that since the foreign ministers of Britain, France, America, and the Soviet Union failed to reach an agreement, the only fair solution would be for the four powers to entrust the responsibility of drafting the treaty to the twenty-one countries that actually participated in the war.

### The Term "Refugee"

Also Applicable to Political Refugees

[United Press, London, 18th] The United Nations Refugee Committee today passed a resolution by a vote of 1,000 to 6, stating that the term refugee should also apply to political refugees.

### Laski Claims Britain Will Never Go to War With the Soviet Union

[Agence France-Presse, Bucharest, 18th] Professor Laski, Chairman of the British Labour Party, told reporters from the Romanian Free Press yesterday that the Romanian people must understand that Britain and the British Labour Party will never go to war with the Soviet Union to defend the interests of reactionary forces in the Balkan countries, which would immediately lead to a civil war at home. We are currently trying to reach a close understanding with the Soviet Union and all democratic countries. As far as Romania is concerned, the most important issue is to establish a solid democratic order among all democratic forces within the United Nations.

### Iran Has Not Yet Submitted a Report on the Withdrawal of Soviet Troops, The United Nations Security Council May Reconvene Tomorrow or the Day After, Representative of Azerbaijan Explains Reasons for Breakdown of Negotiations

[Report from this Newspaper] San Francisco, 19th Broadcasting: The Iranian representative today requested the Security Council to allow Iran to postpone reporting on the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Azerbaijan. It is said that the Security Council stipulated on May 8th that Iran should submit a report on the withdrawal of Soviet troops by tomorrow (the 20th). The Iranian side requested a postponement because it had not yet received notification from the Soviet side.

[Reuters, New York, 19th] Iranian Prime Minister Saed notified the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Lie, last night that the Iranian government would report to the Security Council on the situation of the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Iran as soon as possible, and stated that it was currently unable to report the details of the Soviet troop withdrawal to the Council on May 20th, as stipulated in the Council's resolution of May 8th.

[United Press, New York, 18th] Several representatives of the Security Council said today that when the Council reconvenes on Tuesday or Wednesday of next week, the Soviet representative may refuse to discuss the Iranian issue.

[Reuters, London, 19th] Tehran Radio announced that the four-member delegation sent by the Iranian government to the Azerbaijan province arrived in Tabriz, the capital of the province, and then went to a certain place northeast of the city to investigate whether the Soviet troops had completely withdrawn from the province and would later submit an investigation report to the Prime Minister.

[Agence France-Presse, Tabriz, 18th] Pishevari, the leader of the autonomous government of Azerbaijan province, recently told reporters from this agency that the negotiations between the province and the central government have broken down, and that although Prime Minister Saed wanted to reach an understanding with Azerbaijan province, other cabinet members firmly opposed it, leading to the breakdown of negotiations. The central gendarmerie has been rampant in Azerbaijan province, and they will never be allowed to return. If necessary, the people of this province will fight to the last drop of blood to fight for freedom and reform. At this point, the reporter asked whether troops were concentrated on the border of Azerbaijan province. Pishevari replied that the troops of Azerbaijan province are prepared to deal with all emergencies. The border has not been sealed off, and is only guarded by the defense forces. In any case, I still hope that the central and local governments can reach an agreement soon.

### American Federation of Labor Declaration Condemns Soviet Union for Threatening Peace, Asks US Government to Firmly Declare that the Soviet Union Should Fulfill the Atlantic Charter

[Reuters, Washington, 19th] The American Federation of Labor issued a declaration last night, condemning the policies adopted by the Soviet Union since the end of the war, expressing concern about the increasing threat of a third world war, and emphasizing the differences in policies between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union. The declaration stated that the Soviet Union, in both Europe and Asia, acts arbitrarily without consulting with other countries. The Soviet Union has detained occupied territories and expanded its sphere of influence in Asia and Eastern Europe by various means. Its actions are less like self-defense and more like aggression. If the Soviet Union adopts a tough policy, then we should show that we can adopt a tough policy to protect fundamental principles. We ask the US government to firmly declare that the Soviet Union should fulfill its responsibilities under the Atlantic Charter.

### Extreme Heat in Mexico

Crops Affected

[Agence France-Presse, Mexico, 18th] Mexico is being hit by a heat wave. The temperature here has risen to 112 degrees Fahrenheit, and as high as 120 degrees in the central part of the country. If this continues, crops will be affected.

### Greek Political Situation Is Like a Live Volcano

There is a Possibility of Eruption at Any Time

[Agence France-Presse, London, 18th] British Labour MP Solley recently travelled to Greece with two other Labour MPs and recently returned to this country from Athens. He gave a speech in Cressex, Essex, stating that Greece has become a volcano and could erupt at any time. Ninety percent of the Greek government is fascist. I have witnessed in various places that royalists and fascist politicians in the current government are creating a state of terror to oppose the people. Former Foreign Minister Sophianopoulos told me that the general election held on March 31st was a complete farce. Former Prime Minister Sophoulis also told us that unless we can guarantee that a referendum will be held in 1948 when domestic order is completely restored, I will not support any elections.

### US Railway Workers Temporarily Suspend Strike

### Indo-Dutch Resume Negotiations, Warfare Pervades the Entire Island of Java, Determined to Fight for Freedom

[Report from this Newspaper] London, 19th Broadcasting: Dutch East Indies Governor-General Van Mook is resuming negotiations with East Indies leaders today.

[Reuters, Batavia, 19th] Warfare is rampant throughout the interior of Java, and the forty million islanders are actively organizing for war with complete determination. Young people in many villages in the central region are receiving military training with enthusiasm, and left-wing workers are not to be seen. There is still no sign of resuming talks with the Netherlands. Indonesian leaders are all confident of achieving their minimum demands, based on their actual strength rather than hoping that the Netherlands will meet their wishes in the next talks. Most Indonesians believe that the 20,000 Dutch troops stationed in Java and the few Dutch troops in Sumatra are not enough to prevent the two islands from declaring independence if they do not receive the support of British troops (who are already withdrawing).

### French Statement: Pacific Bases Not Intended to be Conceded to the US

[United Press, Paris, 19th] French government officials stated today that France does not intend to cede any bases in the Pacific to the United States and will protect them on its own without the assistance of any other country.

[Remodeling Press, Tokyo, 19th] Just after the May Day holiday, over twenty thousand people held a large rally in front of the Imperial Palace Plaza today. Around 9 o'clock, most of the plaza was already occupied by these people. Heads bobbed and red flags flew. The participants were of all stripes. One group was uniformly dressed in red shorts, with white cloth pasted on their chests, on which was written "Oppose the Reactionary Cabinet, Establish a People's Government." One youth team uniformly wore white hats. A group of elementary school students held up a banner that read "We're Starving!" led into the plaza by their teachers. Around 10 o'clock, people began to speak from a temporary platform made of ten trucks, saying that the Emperor does not hear our voices of hunger, that reactionary elements only seek to suppress the people's voices, that food should be managed by the people, that distribution must be fair, and that the people must establish a democratic cabinet, etc. A woman carrying a baby spoke from the platform on behalf of housewives, demanding food. A fifth-grade student also took the stage and said that we have no rice to bring to school to fill our stomachs at noon, and we have no heart to study. Communist Party Secretary-General Tokuda also took the stage and shouted to form a democratic front, establish a democratic government, and solve the food problem only by reforming the government structure. Finally, they passed a letter to the Emperor. The meeting adjourned at 10:30 and proceeded with a demonstration. The ranks were neat and orderly. Passing by the headquarters of the Yoshida cabinet, which was in the midst of a difficult formation, they shouted slogans such as "Down with the Reactionary Government" and "We Want Food," mixed with the Internationale and the Red Flag song. At 1 pm, the vanguard of thousands of people first arrived at the planned dispersal point, the plaza in front of the Sakashitamon gate of the Imperial Palace, and rushed to within fifty meters of the gate. A hundred policemen attempted to stop them with batons, and a small conflict broke out with the crowd. Wooden sticks and hats flew in the air, but order was finally restored by the leaders and they dispersed.

### International Food and Agriculture Conference Opens in the US Today, Plans a Grand Scheme to Alleviate Famine, The Soviet Union Refuses to Send Representatives

[Reuters, Washington, 19th] It is understood that Argentina, the Soviet Union, and Siam have not yet accepted the invitation issued by the World Food and Agriculture Organization conference. Soviet officials said that the matter still needs to be discussed with the various Soviet republics and have not yet responded. Argentina is still in consultation.

[Associated Press, Washington, 18th] The International Food Conference is scheduled to open here on Monday to discuss a grand scheme to ensure that everyone in the world has enough to eat, but the Soviet Union has not agreed to provide assistance. The conference is convened by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and will address many of the issues related to the current famine and focus on issues beyond 1945. US experts plan to propose improving the International Food Agency by adding representatives from Australia, Argentina, and France to the United Food Committee. Currently, the members of the committee are only the US, Britain, and Canada. A representative from UNRRA may also attend the committee to better represent countries such as China that are receiving UNRRA relief. UNRRA personnel have previously criticized the Food Committee for failing to allocate as much food as UNRRA requested. The conference will last eight days, and no fewer than twenty countries and international organizations related to food issues will participate. According to the Soviet Embassy in the United States, the Soviet Union will not send representatives to attend or observers to listen. The purpose of the conference is to establish a permanent agreement on food production and distribution between the major food-producing countries. At the opening of the meeting on Monday, the representatives will listen quietly to President Truman's address. The committees will spend most of their time holding closed-door meetings this week to formulate a permanent plan to solve the world's food problems, which will be submitted to the plenary session on the 27th for approval and then submitted to the plenary session of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. According to US authorities who declined to be named, Marshal Stalin has refused President Truman's request for the Soviet Union to cooperate more closely with the Western powers to deal with the current famine, so there is no longer any hope of the Soviet Union joining the United Food Committee.

### 282 European and Asian War Criminals Executed

Previous reports from the Czech war crimes trials proved that in October and November of last year, a total of 1,291 people were tried, of whom 44 were sentenced to death, 52 were sentenced to life imprisonment, and another 984 were sentenced to imprisonment for varying terms. In the Pacific region, the US Navy tried 42 people, resulting in 17 death sentences and 21 prison sentences.

### The Minister of Agriculture was Once Vacant, The Yoshida Cabinet is About to Collapse, Without Solving the Food Problem, Political Stability is Difficult to Expect

[Remodeling Press, Tokyo, 19th Rush Dispatch] Yoshida Shigeru is considering abandoning the formation of the cabinet because Imperial University Professor Tohataseiichi and Ouchi Hyoei both insist that they cannot take the posts of Minister of Agriculture and Director-General of the Economic Stabilization Board because their social policies cannot be implemented. The cabinet formation headquarters announced at 7 pm tonight that the cabinet formation work has fallen into extreme difficulty, and Yoshida may go to the Imperial Palace to resign his mandate to form a cabinet. At 8 pm, it was announced that the situation had slightly changed, that discussions were still underway, and that the final decision had not been reached.

[Remodeling Press, Tokyo, 18th Evening Dispatch] The most difficult aspect of the Yoshida new cabinet formation work is the lack of a candidate for the position of Minister of Agriculture. Because the most serious problem in Japan today is the food problem. The majority of the Japanese people are on the verge of starvation. If it is not resolved quickly, political stability is difficult to expect, but given the nature of the new cabinet, it is feared that it will be unable to solve serious issues.

### US Import and Export Bank Approves Loan to France

[United Press, Washington, 18th] According to reliable sources, the Export-Import Bank has approved a loan of $650 million to France to help it revive its industry. This loan amount was recommended by the National Advisory Council on Foreign Loans, appointed by President Truman. The chairman of the committee is Treasury Secretary Vinson. The total amount of credit loans from the United States to help France resolve its wartime domestic and foreign debts, settle outstanding Lend-Lease accounts, and purchase surplus US goods will reach more than $1 billion.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 18th] Economic and financial giants who previously participated in Franco-American economic negotiations in Washington have just returned from Washington and stated that the total amount of loans from the United States to France will reach as much as $2 billion. The negotiations did not involve French domestic politics, and even the nationalization of certain enterprises was not discussed.

### Resisting the British Delegation's Proposal: Indian Muslims Demonstrate; Gandhi and Lawrence, etc., Hold Lengthy Talks Again; Burma Pleads for India's Assistance in Achieving Freedom

[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 19th (Broadcast): Burmese leader Ba Swe visited Gandhi today, requesting Indian assistance in obtaining independence and freedom. Gandhi especially offered his full support, saying that if its neighboring countries continue to be enslaved, India can never breathe freely.

Another report: Gandhi presented a report at today's National Congress Party meeting regarding his negotiations with the British, and a meeting with the British delegation is scheduled again for tomorrow.

[Reuters, Calcutta, 19th] Chittagong, eastern Bengal Province, yesterday saw the first demonstration by Indian Muslims against the British Cabinet Delegation's proposals. As they paraded, a military vehicle and a civilian automobile driven by a European drove into the procession, injuring seventeen people. The crowd immediately set both vehicles on fire. In addition, several shops and restaurants were vandalized, and stones were thrown at a movie theater.

[Reuters, New Delhi, 19th] Gandhi met again today with British Cabinet representatives Lawrence and Cripps for two hours. It is generally believed that Gandhi was asking the British representatives to clarify certain points in the proposal, especially regarding the provincial system. The powers and structure of the interim government were also likely discussed. It is expected that Gandhi, Lawrence, and Cripps may need to meet again before the National Congress Executive Committee passes a resolution on the British plan.

[United Press of India, New Delhi, 18th] Gandhi told a group of National Congress Party members today that the British Cabinet Delegation's proposal to organize an Indian Federation includes "the seeds to transform this land of sorrow into a land without sorrow or worry." The delegation can be truly proud of this proposal. Whatever mistakes British rule in India has made, if the delegation's proposals are genuine (which I believe they are), it would be their so-called discharge of their obligations to India.

[Reuters, Amritsar, India, 19th] The Sikh "Shiromani Akali Association" passed a resolution at its meeting yesterday, stating that the British Cabinet Delegation's proposal regarding India's future status places the Sikh people under Muslim rule, harms the interests of the Sikh people, and is completely unsatisfactory to the Sikh people. The association also decided to call on the entire community to unite and hold a mass rally on the 26th to protest.

### Hunger-Stricken People in the Ruhr District: Incidents of Intercepting Vehicles and Seizing Food Occur Repeatedly

[Agence France-Presse, Hamburg, 18th] The British Control Commission recently issued a public statement saying that incidents of looting food have occurred repeatedly in the British-occupied zone of Germany for several weeks, especially in Essen in the Ruhr district. Residents of the area have not seen potatoes since April, and they wait for food trucks to pass by and then loot them. First, they damage the railroad tracks, and when the train approaches the city, they force the driver to drive slowly. Hundreds of people then rush into the train and seize potatoes and other food, throwing them to the men, women, and children lined up along the tracks. In Duisburg, there were three incidents of food looting in one day. Police opened fire, killing one person and injuring several others. German police and British military authorities are cooperating to organize mobile units to protect the Ruhr district's railways. One hundred people have been arrested.

Having felt the pain of defeat in the recent referendum on the constitutional draft, the Communist Party has launched a full-force, organized offensive, seeking to remain the single strongest party in the new constituent assembly. The Communist Party originally held 151 seats. In terms of elections, they have already lost ground to the Socialist Party. The Socialist Party not only rejected the Communist Party's proposal for a joint election campaign but also launched a media offensive, publishing articles questioning the extent of their "democracy." This is the right-wing's response to the Communist Party's claim that Communist leader Thorez should be prime minister.

[United Press, Akron, 18th] A Black man, Robertson, jumped from the Akron Bridge, which is 173 feet high, today and survived his suicide attempt.

### U.S. Proposes to the United Nations the Establishment of an Atomic Economic Effects Committee

[Central News Agency, New York, 17th] Following President Truman's announcement that the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission will hold its first meeting on June 14, the United States today proposed to the United Nations the establishment of a permanent Atomic Economic Effects Sub-Committee. The United States suggested at a meeting of the Economic and Employment Committee of the Economic and Social Council that the sub-committee should conduct its work separately from the existing Atomic Energy Commission. The U.S. plan was proposed by the U.S. representative to the Economic and Employment Committee, Mr. Ruzui. The committee did not immediately take action on his proposal. According to the U.S. plan, the sub-committee will keep the permanent UN Economic and Employment Committee regularly informed of the industrial and agricultural possibilities of atomic energy and its possible effects on world economic stability and full employment. Americans believe that the development of atomic energy, especially as a source of productivity, will cause major changes in industry and agriculture, which may affect the future of the world economy. Therefore, it should be constantly studied, especially its effects on coal and oil in industry.

### Tram Strike: Deadlock; Labor and Management Tend Towards Extremes; Director Zhao Talks About Two Factions Among Employees; If Work Is Not Resumed Today, Forceful Execution Will Be Implemented

[Report from this newspaper] The British-owned tram company's tram cars, both rail and trackless, were still not running yesterday. Although the Bureau of Social Affairs sent a decree ordering the employees to resume work first, it was not accepted. Yesterday morning, the Mediation Section of the police department sent personnel to mediate. The labor side demanded that the several thousand field employees should receive the same ten yuan basic salary increase as the hundred or so staff members. After this opinion was conveyed to the person in charge of the management side, it was firmly rejected, stating that they would rather stop operating. The union then convened an emergency board of directors meeting in the afternoon. The majority expressed that since the management had made this statement, they were forced to leave for the sake of their livelihoods and could even accept retirement pay. Both sides were in a stalemate, and the future development was not optimistic.

According to Zhao Zengjue, director of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, speaking to reporters: the bureau has held negotiations with company officials and employee representatives, "If they do not resume work today (referring to yesterday), forceful execution will be implemented tomorrow (that is, today)." Zhao also said: This labor dispute seems very complicated. According to investigations, employees can be roughly divided into two factions: one is the local faction, and the other is the Jiangbei faction. The local faction is quite willing to resume work, but is opposed by the Jiangbei faction, so they cannot reach a consensus. On the evening of the 17th, the Public Utilities Bureau and the tram company reached an agreement with several employee representatives to continue working on the morning of the 18th. Unexpectedly, after several trams were dispatched, a group of people who did not know the true situation beat and prevented some of the staff from proceeding. According to preliminary investigations, it is heard that these assailants are not employees of the company. The authorities are currently trying to investigate. Regarding the increase in low salaries, the Executive Yuan has issued an order that employee salaries have already been adjusted according to the cost of living index, and basic salaries cannot be further increased. Therefore, the relevant authorities and the company are currently discussing whether to re-determine the grades to improve treatment.

### Customs Officers' Work Slowdown Shows No Progress; Fishmongers' Disturbance Resolved

The work slowdown by employees of the Jianghai Customs has not yet been resolved as of yesterday. The Customs authorities are still insisting on resuming work first before negotiations can begin. In addition, yesterday was a scheduled Sunday holiday, and most offices were closed, so there was no negotiation. The situation is still at a standstill and needs to be seen what develops today. It is tending toward a larger scale.

The fishmongers' strike has lasted for many days. After multiple mediations, an agreement has been reached on the elimination of foreign helpers and the competition for four-wheeled carts and trucks. Therefore, they officially announced yesterday that they would resume business, and all vendors are making three times their usual profit.

Regarding the labor dispute in the Western clothing industry, although the management has resumed business, the labor side has not yet resumed work and is still awaiting negotiations for a resolution.

### Police Bureau Prevents Expansion of Labor Unrest

The Municipal Police Bureau believes that labor unrest in the city continues to arise. If this stalemate persists, it will hinder social order. A special order was issued to all branch bureaus to find ways to prevent it. The original text is roughly as follows: Rice prices are soaring, and public sentiment is uneasy, which is why labor unrest is rising and falling. Most factory employees are doing this for the sake of their livelihoods, which is understandable. However, there are a few petty criminals who are taking the opportunity to make trouble. From now on, each branch bureau should find ways to prevent labor unrest from expanding and affecting social order.

### Three Thousand Street Cleaners Demand Improved Treatment: Slogans Pasted on Brooms, A Grand Procession; Supervising Authorities Persuade to Resume Work

More than three thousand street cleaners in this city, demanding improved treatment, went on strike the day before yesterday and marched to the Sanitation Bureau to petition. Since they did not get results, they gathered more than a thousand people yesterday morning, each carrying a broom with slogans pasted on it. They paraded grandly from Hongkou, via Bazi Road, Henan Road, Nanjing Road, to the Bureau of Social Affairs on Linsen Road to petition. However, yesterday was Sunday, and the Bureau of Social Affairs was closed, so they did not get what they wanted. By the afternoon, this broom parade dispersed. In addition, the person in charge of the cleaning team of the Municipal Sanitation Bureau issued a statement yesterday regarding the street cleaners' strike: Recently, prices in the city have been rising sharply, and labor unrest in various industries has been arising in waves. The street cleaners live a hard life and cannot avoid being affected by it. They should know that street cleaners are employees hired by the government, which is completely different from ordinary labor-management relations. If there are reasonable requests, they should follow proper channels, and they will never be allowed to coerce with strike tactics. Some street cleaners previously requested to organize a trade union. At that time, the Sanitation Bureau did not approve it because it was not in accordance with the provisions of the Trade Union Law. Furthermore, regarding the remuneration of street cleaners, the team has been handling it in accordance with municipal government regulations. The basic salary for street cleaners in April was 35 yuan, and for garbage collectors, it was 45 yuan, plus a cost-of-living allowance of 40,000 yuan and a rice subsidy of 12,000 yuan, for a total of 52,035 yuan per street cleaner and 52,045 yuan per garbage collector. They have already been issued clearly. The rice subsidy for May increased by 20,000 yuan per person, so street cleaners each receive 60,035 yuan, and garbage collectors receive 60,045 yuan. According to regulations, they are not issued 160 times the increased amount. The bureau has adjusted the amount of living expenses from time to time, so it lists the amount to be issued each time when issuing wages and distributes it to various locations for public notice to show credibility. After this incident occurred, Director Yu was very angry and gave strict instructions, limiting the time to resume work. The division, in addition to the respective supervisors being responsible for guiding, and making statements on the lives of the street cleaners upwards to the authorities for a comprehensive adjustment, deeply hopes that all the street cleaners will appreciate the difficult times and resume work immediately.

### Mayor Wu Serves as Chairman of the Housing Allocation Committee; Vice Mayor He Serves as Vice Chairman

[Report from this newspaper] Qian Dajun, chairman of the Housing Allocation Committee of the Executive Yuan, and Peng Xuepei, vice chairman, have been approved to resign. The Executive Yuan has appointed Mayor Wu Guozhen as chairman and Secretary-General He Dequi as vice chairman. Huang Boqiao will continue to serve as vice chairman.

In addition, the company is urging the company to register and report accurately, otherwise the allocation group will forcibly execute it.

[Another report] The committee's investigation work has been completed and is about to be reviewed and allocated. However, the remaining houses in the former Japanese residences in the Hongkou district are still being forcibly occupied by armed personnel from time to time. The competent authorities hope that citizens will report them so that they can be enforced to order them to move out and maintain government orders.

The Jianghai Customs Dredging Bureau, entrusted by the municipal government, has begun sending personnel to measure Suzhou Creek. It will be dredged from Waibaidu Bridge to Jiaotong University.

### Stolen Cloth from Enemy Merchant Mitsubishi Warehouse Recovered

Captain Zhang Renyou of the Tilanqiao Police Bureau received a report from plainclothes detectives Qiu Zhenting and Guo Yunxing that the thieves who stole cloth from the former Japanese Mitsubishi warehouse in the old shipyard alley on Yangshupu Road were living at No. 103 Yongcheng Li, Daming Road.

### China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiangya Steamer Transferred to Shanghai-Ningbo Route; First Voyage Scheduled for the Day After Tomorrow

[Report from this newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company previously leased the Zhoushan Steamer to operate the Shanghai-Ningbo route. The Zhoushan Company has now taken back the ship for its own use and is operating the Fuzhou route, also calling at Wanningbo. It made its first voyage from Shanghai to Ningbo and Fuzhou last Friday. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Ningbo route has been suspended due to this. However, there are many passengers on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, and the cargo transport in eastern Zhejiang is also very important. Although there are still the Zhoushan and Dahua steamers operating, the Zhoushan steamer also calls at Wanning, so the sailing schedule is longer. The Dahua steamer suffered mechanical damage on its last voyage from Ningbo to Shanghai and is currently under repair. Therefore, there is a great need for a ship on the Shanghai-Ningbo route. Therefore, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company immediately transferred the Jiangya steamer to the Shanghai-Ningbo route. The ship has a gross tonnage of over 3,000 tons, similar to the former Xinjiangtian, and also has many passenger seats. It has now been newly painted and is scheduled to cast off at 3:00 PM on the 22nd (Tuesday). The ship will dock at the Jinliyuan Wharf. The Jiangya steamer was originally planned to call at Zhenhai when it operates the Shanghai-Ningbo route. However, it is now learned that it is inconvenient for the ship to turn around and dock because the ship is large, and due to time constraints, it will temporarily not call at Zhenhai and will go directly to Ningbo.

### Re-election of Senators in Changning and Yulin Districts Completed; Gu Zhuqi, Gu Zhuxuan, and Ji Hao, etc., Elected

[Report from this newspaper] The re-election of municipal senators in the 9th (Changning) and 19th (Yulin) districts was completed yesterday in a calm atmosphere. For the sake of prudence, the Civil Affairs Department of the municipal government specially dispatched Li Xuexun, section chief of the third section, and Chen Pu, section chief of the second section, to the two districts to preside over the election supervision. In addition, additional polling places were set up in the two districts, six in the 9th district and seven in the 19th district. Two representatives and one supervisor were assigned to each polling place, and there were also patrol officers and police officers to maintain order. From 7:00 AM, the voters in the two districts went to the polling places with their national ID cards to collect ballots. Therefore, the order of voting and elections throughout the day was good. There were candidates in the two districts who sent people to post slogans, but the election mood was not as enthusiastic and chaotic as the first time. After the voting time ended at 7:00 PM, the ballots were counted separately in the two districts. The number of votes in each district was around 30,000, and the counting ended around 11:00 PM. The results are recorded as follows:

### Indian Seal Carving Expert Gao Tianxin Talks About Art

[Report from this newspaper] Gao Tianxin, an expert in Indian seal carving, and his wife, Zang Manjun, have carved seals for many years in Zhejiang, Nanjing, Chengdu, Chongqing, and other places, earning a remarkable reputation. They have come to Shanghai this time and plan to continue selling seals. Yesterday, he had a conversation with reporters about the art of seal carving. Gao has been carving seals for 20 years. He began studying at the age of 13 and began selling his works at the age of 14. His father, Gao Yingsan, was a famous brick engraver and seal carver. Gao said that the difference between a stone engraver and an ordinary seal carver is that ordinary seal carvers do not study seal script and knife techniques. Most people like to carve seals with precious ivory, crystal, or metal, but in reality, stone seals are the best to express exquisite skills. The smallest seals can be carved on materials as thick as a matchstick, but in terms of results, the larger the area, the better the technique can be expressed. In order to preserve and promote national essence, Gao has decided to make seal carving his lifelong career. Gao's wife is also proficient in this skill. The seals she carves are generous and powerful, truly expressing her strong personality. In the summer of 1941, Gao witnessed Japanese planes bombing Chengdu and carved two seals, which he presented to former US President Roosevelt. He attached a letter calling for aid from the perspective of the people, and received a letter of thanks from President Roosevelt's representative in the US Department of State. He also created an exhibition of anti-Japanese war seals in Chongqing and Chengdu, which was well-received.

### American Retired Engineer Mr. Tai Plans to Come to Shanghai to Engage in Electrical Business; Says China's Industrial Future Is Limitless

[United Press, New York, 18th] American engineer Mr. Tai, having just retired after serving five years in the wartime engineering department of the Navy Department, is scheduled to leave the United States in June and will be stationed in Shanghai as a representative of the New York-based Wiley-Han Construction Company, serving as the manager of the company's power department.

Mr. Tai plans to stay in China for at least four years, hoping to contract for his company projects related to China's industrialization plan, especially electrical development, tram tracks, and related projects. The Wiley-Han Company was operating in China before the war and represented some American manufacturers. According to Mr. Tai, the scope of his work is not limited to large-scale hydroelectric power projects, but will also be engaged in smaller local power generation equipment, leading to household electrification, and the electrification of textile factories, cement plants, and other industries.

If any citizen needs my help, they can come to see me at any time, and I will never refuse.

### Special Agent Under the Devil, Fan Shunxing, Commits Many Evils, Victims Meet on a Narrow Road

[Our Report] Fan Shunxing, a 47-year-old man from Yangzhou, resides at No. 14 Bulin Lane, Jinling Road. He is currently a foreman at Datong Shipping Company and Dada Wharf, etc. He owns assets and has three wives and concubines, appearing to be a wealthy man. During the enemy puppet period, he served as a special agent under Wu Shibao, a murderous devil, acting as an accomplice and oppressing the good people, committing all kinds of evils. Pan Shirong and his wife, who lived at No. 20 Juqing Lane, Xinzha Road, were once deceived to the Paramount Ballroom and falsely accused of being underground workers. They were imprisoned in "No. 76" for 68 days. After the victory, Pan once filed a lawsuit with the court, but Fan refused to be summoned and disappeared. Unexpectedly, around 11:00 AM yesterday, the plaintiff Mrs. Pan met Fan on Jinling Road. The victims met on a narrow road, so she grabbed Fan's collar and called the police. Fan was taken to the Huangpu Police Station and is currently being strictly interrogated by the Criminal Division of the branch.

### Ma Yinchu Gives a Public Speech, His Eloquent Words Move People, Read More Books and Look Less at Money, Claims He Could Do Business If He Were Shameless

[Our Report] Dr. Ma Yinchu, a famous Chinese economist, gave his first public speech in Shanghai yesterday morning at 10:00 AM at the Ningbo Compatriots Association at the invitation of the Lixin Alumni Association. First, Pan Xulun, the principal of Lixin Accounting School, gave a brief introduction, followed by Mr. Ma speaking amidst the enthusiastic applause of more than a thousand listeners. He first said that China had always adopted single-entry bookkeeping, but since Pan Xulun advocated double-entry bookkeeping, it has recently achieved success, so Mr. Pan can be regarded as the pioneer of accounting in China. He then said that the living conditions in the rear were vastly different from those in Shanghai. Sichuan is a large place, but the food is very poor. Public school teachers eat rotten rice. According to what Mr. Ma knew, there were as many as 74 ways for rice merchants to cheat. The most shocking one was that Jiangyun rice merchants often mixed powder ground from the bones of dead people into the rice, and then watered it, so the rice would swell and the weight would increase. Inspectors often walked barefoot on the rice. If their feet felt itchy, it was certain that there were dead people's bones in the rice. The rice transporters only needed to hear the inspector say "itchy feet" to know that the fraud had been exposed. This rice can still be used for meals after washing, but such methods are probably unimaginable to Shanghai people. As for clothing, people in the countryside often wear new clothes, while public school teachers are poor. Some places do not have electric lights and use tung oil lamps instead. The smoke is heavy and the light is dim, making it especially difficult to read and write. However, every time I think about the soldiers on the front lines, whose difficulties are even deeper than those in the rear, I feel at peace.

The lack of books is also a major difficulty. Some books are stored deep and secret due to bombing prevention, and cannot be read by the public. But the staff and students in the rear still work hard. Mr. Ma said with a very sighing tone: "If I were shameless, why couldn't I do business?" But I still sit and watch the vulgar merchants and profiteers get rich. It is said that many difficulties can rejuvenate the country. "Scholars" are the pioneers of society and must not go with the tide.

Mr. Ma continued: There is pleasure in reading. We should sacrifice material enjoyment. Shanghai has not made any progress in morality and thought during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War. "Everywhere is money, money, money, money, money!" Most people only know how to do calculations all day long, but they do not know that people must have "personality" and need to do something and achieve something. Otherwise, what is the point of living a life of labor! If a person has no lofty purpose, then this person is not worth taking. Religious figures create the world, which is actually a "man-made world." We should read books and study science on the one hand, and on the other hand, we should also create civilization in terms of morality and spirit. From this, we can see the importance of philosophy. We should stand in our own positions, do our best to teach, do our best to read, and work for the country. We must know that reading is not easy in China. More than 90% of the people in the country are illiterate.

In life, looking at Shanghai on the one hand and looking at the countryside on the other hand, we can know that our living standards in Shanghai are far above those of "country people." In the countryside, sometimes even bran cannot be eaten. If you don't go to the plains, how can you know the high mountains! Therefore, it is said that learning should look upwards, and life should look downwards. Studying is for learning, and no great scholar in the world studies for money.

### Guangdong Disaster Petition Delegation Scheduled to Return to Guangdong

Wu Zhimei, Cai Yizhong, Lu Yougang, Hu Mulan, Xiao Ciyin, and other representatives of the Guangdong disaster petition delegation flew to Beijing a few days ago to request the central government to allocate food for relief.

The authorities agreed to allocate flour and white rice to Guangdong for relief. Also, Director Jiang Tingfu of the Executive Yuan telegraphed the Guangdong branch to distribute the remaining food in the Guangzhou warehouse within ten days for urgent relief.

[Our Report] Cheng Kangfu, a 31-year-old man from Anhui Province, who works in a bank, lives on the front floor of No. 1 Heming Lane, Pu'an Road, Ninghai Road. Cheng married a woman from his hometown, Mrs. Zai, many years ago. They have been married for eight years and have two sons, the elder named Zhenhong (7 years old) and the younger named Zhenxi (3 years old). Unexpectedly, Cheng had an affair with a woman named Zhu Baoyuan, who lived at No. 12 Junle Village, Zhongzheng Road. As time went on, the affair was exposed and discovered by his wife. She remonstrated in vain. Mrs. Zai, in a fit of anger, found four opium pipes the night before and attempted to commit suicide with her whole family. She swallowed two pipes herself and divided the remaining pipes to her two children. Fortunately, the eldest son, Zhenhong, tasted something strange after eating and immediately spat it into the spittoon. The younger child, Zhenxi, was young and ignorant and swallowed a pipe. After taking the poison, the mother and children closed the door and went to bed, preparing to die. As a result, apart from Zhenhong being safe and sound, Mrs. Zai and her younger son Zhenxi had an attack of poison at dawn. Their groans reached the outside. The neighbors noticed and broke into the house. They saw that the mother and son were in abnormal condition. They quickly reported to the Taishan Police Station and summoned an ambulance. They were rushed to the hospital for treatment. The younger son, Zhenxi, died in the hospital at 4:00 PM.

### Night Body Fuel Black Market Eliminated

Liquid fuels such as kerosene and gasoline have been shipped to Shanghai by Mobil, Texaco and other oil companies, providing a large supply to the market. People who hoard them see that there is no profit to be made and sell them one after another, causing the black market to plummet and nearing complete elimination. At present, the supply of gasoline and kerosene has returned to the state before the war. They can be purchased everywhere.

### Jiangsu Relief Administration Adds Refresher Courses and Teacher Training Institutes

Refugees Must Register and Be Accommodated First

[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang News] The Jiangsu Youth Resumption of School and Employment Assistance Office of the Ministry of Education previously contacted Xuzhou Normal School, Wuhu Vocational Training Class, and Shanghai Teacher Training Institute to send students, but all three locations were unable to accommodate them due to limited quotas, resulting in refugees wandering in Zhenjiang, at a loss. In order to start work and solve the students' schooling problem, the office has added a Zhenjiang Teacher Training Institute and a Taixian Middle School Refresher Class, in addition to the class levels and quotas stipulated by the general association, in response to the urgent needs of the province. The office previously sent specialists Hang Yanfu and Cao Yuan to be responsible for preparations. The Taixian Middle School Refresher Class has determined the original site of Taizhou Vocational School and Jiao De Middle School as the class site, and is currently fixing it. There are many locations for the Zhenjiang Teacher Training Institute, but all the buildings are damaged, and it will take a lot of money and time to repair them. The budget has now been completed and submitted to the general association for approval. Because the refugee students lack food and clothing, in order to provide urgent relief, students assigned to the Taizhou Middle School Refresher Class and the Zhenjiang Teacher Training Institute will begin to register at the office from the 10th of this month and will be accommodated in the institute on the 7th and 8th. Among the students who have dropped out of school in Zhenjiang, 128 have been assigned to the Taizhou Middle School Refresher Class and 248 to the Zhenjiang Teacher Training Institute. According to Niu Jianchu, director of the office, the office's work in the past three months has focused on the relief and assistance of out-of-school youth. In the future, the office will also consider the employment assistance of unemployed youth, in order to increase the number of students returning to school and reduce the number of unemployed youth.

### Nanchang Schools Hold Hygiene Competition with Ten Scoring Standards

[Dahua News Agency Nanchang News] The Jiangxi Provincial Health Education Association, in view of the fact that the school buildings of public and private schools at all levels in the provincial capital were mostly ravaged by the enemy during the occupation period and were severely damaged, and due to funding and time constraints after the restoration, they could not be repaired completely in a short time, and could only barely function, so the school environment generally could not pay attention to hygiene, which had a profound impact on students' health. Now that summer has arrived and diseases are rampant, and schools are public places, it is easier to spread diseases. Therefore, the association has jointly organized a provincial public and private school environmental hygiene competition with the Provincial Anti-epidemic Brigade and the Health Office, which started on the 10th of this month and will end on the 10th of June. The competition standards include ten scoring items: the surrounding conditions of the school buildings, classrooms, hygiene rooms, teacher's offices, kitchens, rooms, drinks, sports fields, toilets, and garbage disposal.

### Zhejiang Education Department Director Xu Talks About the Difficulties of Education Funding

Provincial Middle Schools to End the Semester Early

[Our Newspaper Hangzhou News] Xu Shaodi, Director of the Zhejiang Education Department, said: (1) The education funding for Zhejiang Province is the same for the 35th and 34th years, listed at more than 60 million yuan, while the Ministry's order to add public-funded students' and normal school students' meal expenses to various secondary schools, although it has increased to 8,000 yuan, the number of students has not increased. On average, each student can get 7,000 yuan for meals. It is now planned to sell 60 million yuan of the 80,000 dan of accumulated grain allocated last year to make up for the deficit. (2) The provincial social education funding has been completely cut, which is why the West Lake Museum, the Provincial Library, and the People's Education Center are teetering on the brink. The museum sells tickets, and the auditorium of the Hangzhou People's Education Center is rented out for that reason. (3) The education restoration fund is approved at 200 million yuan, which is why the Provincial Women's Middle School and the People's Education Practice School cannot be restored at present. (4) The local education funding in various counties is also very difficult, with no way to raise funds. It has been decided to rename it as a subsidy. (5) All schools also feel the pain of not being able to receive education funding on time. It is now heard that the provincial middle schools, due to funding difficulties, are difficult to maintain and plan to end the semester early in mid-June. (Shou)

### The Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry Plan to Revive National Aquatic Schools, the Executive Yuan Allocates 26 Fishing Vessels

There is a Rumor That Lianyungang Aquatic School Will Move to Shanghai

[This City News] After eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, most of the original schools in coastal areas that cultivated aquatic and fishery technology were destroyed. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is seeking to revive them and has obtained the assistance of the Executive Yuan to decide to rebuild them. Yesterday, a Datong News Agency reporter learned from personnel of the Executive Yuan that the office has concrete plans for the revival of national aquatic schools. In addition to the fishing vessels supplied by the United States and Australia, there is also a lot of relevant technical information. The Ministry of Agriculture will also rebuild the destroyed schools. The following list shows a glimpse:

(Location) (School) (Survival Status) (Allocated Vessels)

Shanghai Wusong Aquatic School Completely Destroyed Six

Fuhai Zhejiang Provincial Aquatic School Half Destroyed Two

Fuzhou Fujian Provincial Aquatic School Destroyed Two

Xiamen Jimei Aquatic School Exists Two

Yantai Shandong Aquatic School Closed Two

Tianjin Hebei Provincial Aquatic Technical College Exists Three

Yingkou Liaoning Aquatic Technical College Newly Received Two

Shanwei Guangdong Maritime School Not Detailed

Lianyungang Jiangsu Provincial Lianyungang Junior Aquatic School To Be Moved Two

Kaohsiung Taiwan Provincial Aquatic School Newly Received Two

Qingdao National Fisheries and Salt Experiment Field Exists One

The Executive Yuan has allocated a total of 26 fishing vessels to various schools, which will be realized soon. It is also learned that there is a proposal to move the Lianyungang school to Shanghai. It has not yet been determined whether the school will be used as the foundation for the restoration of Wusong Aquatic School and is currently being planned by the Ministry of Agriculture.

### American Education Fund to Subsidize Black Children

[American News Agency Washington, 18th] The Senate Education and Labor Committee yesterday passed a bill on federal education subsidies, so that all famous doctors in the country have equal educational opportunities. The bill stipulates that the federal government will spend $150 million in the first year, $200 million in the second year, and $250 million each year thereafter. The distribution of funds is based on a mathematical formula, proportional to the number of children in a state and inversely proportional to the state's financial strength. Under this method, it is estimated that 33 states, including the southern states, will receive this subsidy. Senator Taft estimates that most of the funds will be used to subsidize black children in the South. The bill expressly stipulates that these funds shall not be used for capital construction, ensuring that most of the funds will be used to raise teachers' salaries.

### Each County Should Have Five or More Central National Schools Designated as Demonstration Schools with Substantial Content to Allow Other Schools to Observe and Learn

[Our Newspaper Nanjing News] During the Anti-Japanese War, the Ministry of Education promulgated the first five-year plan for the implementation of national education nationwide in Chongqing, ordering provinces and cities in the rear to implement it. Therefore, after the victory, provinces and cities were again ordered to implement the second five-year plan, in order to achieve one central national school in each township and one national school in each bao. However, during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the financial resources of the provinces in the rear were also affected by the war. Although the number of national schools has increased over the years, the equipment and content are inevitably simple. In the war zones, due to the destruction of school buildings and equipment by the enemy puppets, it is even more difficult to immediately fully restore the old appearance due to the excessive damage and the lack of economic strength in the current education restoration. It is heard that the Ministry of Education, mindful of this, has formulated a compromise approach to adapt to the current situation. What is the approach? That is, within this year, each county under each province should designate at least five to ten or more central national schools as demonstration area schools, giving priority to enriching the content and all the equipment of these schools to establish a model, so that other schools in the county and city can learn from this impression, and promote progress. It is also heard that the Ministry of Education will issue a notice to the education departments and bureaus of all provinces and cities to strictly comply with it. (Yu)

### Seven Major Japanese Newspapers to Publish Some News in Roman Letters

[Associated Press Tokyo, 19th] Japan's seven largest newspapers, which together reach a circulation of 8.66 million copies, are now preparing and expressing their willingness to publish part of the news in Roman letters, but on the condition that certain problems are solved. Simplifying Japanese characters is the first practical step in accordance with the recommendations of the American educational mission to Japan. The realization of this innovative step now hinges on the following three points: (1) The Japanese government must give Roman letters an official format. (2) It is expected that the part of the news published in Roman letters will be difficult for readers to understand before they are accustomed to the new type of writing, so the newspapers themselves should establish an agreement on the amount of Roman letters used. (3) A definite format for Roman letters should be prescribed.

### Second Respect for Teachers Football Charity Match, Donghua Defeats Western Union Again, Result 3-1, Tied 1-1 in the First Half, Reporter Team Rushed to Fight but Was Defeated by Old and Strong

Old Men's Game

Old and Strong Wins

The opening act, the old men's game between Old and Strong and the sports reporters, started at exactly 3:00 pm. Zhou Jun of Old and Strong did not arrive, and Qu Xigen played as a guest. Because Ma Youyu, Hu Daozhang, Zhang Guochun and other generals from the reporters had just returned from Wuxi, they were tired and exhausted, and their performance was inferior. Moreover, Ma and Hu were injured before the battle, which made them feel stretched. Referee Huang Renyi blew the whistle to start the game, and Old and Strong launched an all-out attack. Wang Weijun and Qian Xucang were like tigers, and the reporters' position was greatly threatened. After five minutes, Xu Huanming shot, hitting the crossbar and bouncing down. Qian Xucang headed the ball, Shi Nizhong fumbled, and Wang Weijun lightly shot it in. The reporters were unwilling and launched a large-scale attack, but the defense of Old and Strong was tight, and it was difficult to succeed. After a long time of melee, Old and Strong came back strongly, and the five forwards attacked in a ring. Shi Nizhong left the goal, and Liao Shun caught the ball. Qian Xucang waited in the right position and shot into the empty goal. The reporters quickly replaced Shi Nizhong with Qu Yaokang. Qu performed with the attitude of McNeety without any mistakes. Soon, the first half ended, and Old and Strong took the lead 2-0. After the change of sides, the reporters Zhang Guochun and Feng Xiaoxiu entered the arena, replacing Qu Yaokang and Di Xianzhang. Old and Strong still tried their best to attack, but fortunately the reporters defended well and did not lose any more goals. In the last ten minutes, the reporters' fortunes turned around, and the offensive became stronger, but the good opportunity was lost, and they could only sigh helplessly. When the time was up, Old and Strong defeated the reporters 2-0.

Main Battle

Donghua Wins Again

At exactly 4:00 pm, the main battle began. Donghua met Western Union again. Jia Youliang and Song Lingsheng of Donghua made a mistake, and Han Longgen and Sun Huiwen played. Referee Deng Xiaoliang and Mayor Qian held the opening ceremony, and the contact began immediately. Donghua's offensive was very strong. After ten minutes, Han Longgen headed the ball and scored the first goal. Western Union tried to retaliate. After 25 minutes, Fafan Xiao did not fail his mission and swept the net. The first half ended with a tie of 1-1. After the change of sides, the lineup of Western Union was slightly adjusted. The five forwards entered the Donghua hinterland, but gained nothing. After 20 minutes, Han Longhai got the ball from the right and shot it out of thin air. Donghua raised his head again. After six minutes, Longhai and Longgen advanced side by side, and Longgen was inspired and made another great contribution. Until the end of the game, Donghua defeated Western Union again with a score of 3-1. The lineups of the four teams are as follows:

Old and Strong Zhou Jiaqi, E Sen, Ma Qingyuan, Qu Xirong, Zhang Le, Qu Xigen, Qian Xucang, Yue Xiurong, Wang Weijun, Xu Huanming, Ding Shunbin.

### Gold and Banknotes Turn from Stable to Rising, Rice Prices Soar Unprecedentedly, Public Bonds and Stocks Both Decline, Yarn, Cotton, and Silk See Mixed Gains and Losses

Among the financial items last week, only the exchange rate of US banknotes was particularly attractive. The vitality of stocks and bonds was sharply reduced. On the commodity side, due to rising prices in the producing areas of rice and the manipulation of large households, the market was unbalanced, creating unprecedented high prices. The situation of each industry is recorded below.

Gold

The trend of gold was stable and slightly upward. With the resumption of the blue-collar stock market indefinite, people were idle, resulting in frequent speculative purchases. Furthermore, the purchasing power of people in various rural areas was very strong. On Monday, it stood firm outside the 1.8 million mark. On Wednesday, the Bank of China's allocation price was 1.73 million, and it secretly absorbed the supply. The foundation was weak, so the final price retreated to 1.725 million. On Thursday and Friday, out-of-town silverware shops absorbed the supply, and the market rose again, reaching 1.8 million. On Saturday, it continued to rise to a peak of 1.92 million.

Foreign Currency

The Bank of China's telegraphic transfer rate for US dollars remained unchanged at 2020. The US dollar fluctuates with the rise and fall of gold prices. On Monday, when the gold price was high at 1.87 million, importers were very willing to accept it, and it once rose from 2280 to 2460 yuan, but then retreated to 2240 yuan. From Tuesday to Thursday, it hovered around 2300 yuan. By Saturday, when gold rose outside the 1.9 million mark, it rose from 2320 to 2400 yuan, and finally to 2410 yuan. The Hong Kong dollar fluctuated slightly. On Monday, it stood at 415 yuan. It once retreated to 400 yuan, but by Saturday it still stood at 415 yuan.

Consolidated Bonds

Rumors of bond redemption have dissipated, and people are calm. Bullish traders are not active, and there has been a surge in selling bonds and buying gold throughout the week. At the beginning of the week, Class C bonds were still hovering at 7200 yuan, but on Friday they fell below 7000 yuan. The final price at the weekend was 6600 yuan. Classes A, B, and D bonds initially traded at 4200 yuan, but also retreated to 3400 or 3500 yuan. Class E bonds retreated from 4500 or 4600 yuan to 3600 or 3700 yuan.

Chinese Stocks

Black market trading was sluggish. Due to the lack of public trading, it was difficult to be active, and the transaction volume was limited. In particular, there was a lack of interest in unpopular stocks, and the transaction volume of popular stocks was also small. Wing On Textile rose after falling. It fell to 4950 on Monday, rose to 5200 on Thursday, and remained around 5200 on Saturday after news of dividend payments. Mei Ya hovered at 4100 or 4200 yuan, closing at 4100 at the weekend. Three small-scale stocks were initially vibrant, hovering in the middle, but ultimately declined. Jingfu fell from 335 yuan to 310 yuan, Xin Guang fell from 275 yuan to 250 yuan, Qin Xing fell from 345 yuan to 225 yuan, pharmacies and underwear remained at 180 yuan, matches fell from 1150 to 1100 yuan, medicines remained around 80 yuan, Xin He fell from 700 yuan to 670 yuan, Zhong Fang Xian experienced both prosperity and decline, and Rong Feng fell from 1250 yuan to 1100 yuan.

Foreign Stocks

Foreign stocks also saw false optimism last week. Few stocks showed improvement, and the trend gradually declined. Only on Thursday, when the money supply eased, did they strengthen slightly after weakening. Jardine Textile fell from 13,200 to 12,000 yuan, English and Allied fell from 12,200 to 11,400, Yeguang fell from 4700 to 4200, Wheelock fell from 20,000 to 19,200, Jardine Brewery fell from 2800 to 2500, Shipping fell from 2100 to 1950, and Iron and Steel fell from 3300 to 2950. Among them, the paper industry experienced relatively stable fluctuations, from 2150 on Monday to a closing price of 2250 yuan on Saturday.

Rice and Grain

At the beginning of the week, the rice market was stable due to the large amount of goods arriving. Flour was also stable due to the impact of grain prices. In terms of miscellaneous grains, soybeans continued to rise by more than 1,000 yuan. Raw peanuts saw mixed gains and losses. Edible oil supply and demand were equal, and the price was similar to that of last Saturday. People were optimistic about sugar, and it rose by about 10%. On Tuesday, rice prices rose sharply again as demand became active in all areas, with increases ranging from 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Flour rose slightly by 700 or 800 yuan. Among miscellaneous grains, soybeans remained stable, raw peanuts saw mixed gains and losses, the edible oil market remained stable, and sugar continued to rise due to high demand. On Wednesday, the rise in rice prices did not stop. Yin rice was the sharpest, rising by 3,000 yuan due to scarcity of goods, while the rest rose by 500 to 1,000 yuan. Flour fell slightly, miscellaneous grains saw mixed gains and losses, edible oil sales were sluggish and fell by more than 1,000 yuan, and sugar fell sharply due to speculators selling for profit, with medium sugar falling by as much as 10,000 yuan. On Thursday, rice prices still hovered and remained firm. White japonica and foreign indica rice rose by 1,000 yuan, while white rice was slightly higher by 2,000 yuan. The flour market was stable, with only dozens of yuan of fluctuations. Miscellaneous grains saw mixed gains and losses, the edible oil market was slightly depressed and continued to fall by about 1,000 yuan, and the sugar market turned firm, with Xinghua white being the most sought after. On Friday, rice prices continued to rise by 4,000 to 5,000 yuan as inventories dwindled and retail sales were active. Flour also rose by more than 1,000 yuan due to the high price of rice. Among miscellaneous grains, soybeans were exported and rose by more than 1,000 yuan, raw peanuts were mediocre, the edible oil market was normal with only 1,000 yuan of fluctuations, and both supply and demand for sugar were scarce, and the market tended to be stable. On Saturday, although the rice supply was smooth, the price increase became more and more intense. Japonica and indica rice both exceeded the 60,000 yuan mark, an increase of 7,000 to 8,000 yuan compared to yesterday. Flour also rose by 1,000 yuan. Among miscellaneous grains, soybeans rose by 2,000 to 4,000 yuan due to the rise in oil prices, and the rest also rose in unison. Edible oil rose sharply due to the influx of hot money, rising by about 10,000 yuan. The sugar market was flat.

Raw Yarn

In the past week, the initial trend was very mediocre. After Wednesday, the actual sales of raw yarn from Tianjin, Guangdong, and the mainland were brisk. Fine yarn was also under the control of the Textile Construction Company, and there were rumors of shortages in the market. The amount of available yarn was dwindling, and the soaring prices of gold and rice made the weekend's rise even more intense, with peaks emerging one after another. The highest for the entire week was 2.45 million for 42-count Blue Phoenix on Saturday, and the lowest was 750,000 for 10-count Double Cat on Tuesday. The difference between the highest and lowest was 1.7 million. In terms of counts, 42-count Blue Phoenix soared by 530,000 compared to the previous week, 40-count of the same brand rose by 410,000, and 32-count Double Twist Fairy Peach rose by 500,000. The increase in yarns of 20 counts and below was very slow due to the relatively large supply. Double Horse rose by 95,000, and 16 and 10 counts only rose by 30,000 or 50,000.

Cloth Market

The market was filled with foreign goods, and buyers from other provinces made ordinary purchases. Most traders were watching and waiting, and the market showed no progress. Grey twill was widely used for making children's clothing and umbrellas, and the situation was the most popular, rising by 4,000 yuan. The remaining items, such as Shihlin drill, 12-pound fine cloth, and 16-pound coarse cloth, only rose by 1,000 or 2,000 yuan.

Cotton Market

The Textile Construction Company did not make any purchases during the week. Private yarn factories such as Shenxin, Sulun, Dasheng, Xinsheng, Minfeng, Fuan, and Xinyu all had considerable needs, and the market was relatively stable, rising by about 2,000 or 3,000 yuan compared to before.

Silk

During the past week, the total loss of 120-count Tianqiao bright artificial silk was about 60,000 or 70,000 yuan. It was 60,000 yuan higher than the previous weekend, and then it gradually declined. This was mainly because Zhongfang released a large amount of goods at prices cheaper than the market price, and the price of Tianqiao also followed suit. On Saturday of last week, Zhongfang opened 1.12 million for 120-count Zhongbiao bright silk, 1.07 million for Black Island bright silk, 1.18 million for Xuhui bright silk, 1.12 million for Toyo semi-bright silk, 1.18 million for 150-count Jinhuanxing bright silk, and 1.18 million for 150-count Jinji semi-bright silk. Given this situation, it is difficult to be optimistic about the price of rayon. The transaction volume of foreign goods by factories and merchants was very low during the week. The average fineness of 81 to 83 points was generally between 2.5 million and 600,000 yuan. The price of medium-grade user silk was between 2 million and 1.95 million yuan, with a fluctuation of 50,000 yuan. The price of dry silk was very stable, always around 1.4 million yuan. The minimum price for American-Asian bedding was 1.11 million yuan, and the maximum was 1.18 million yuan. The price on Monday was similar to that of the weekend. The minimum price for Dacheng plaid was 3,800 yuan, and the maximum was 4,200 yuan. Compared with Monday and the weekend, it was 100 yuan higher.

Hardware

The trend of hardware was stable this week. There were few foreign goods arriving at the port. For domestic goods, the sales of edge yarn were brisk due to the season, and the local inventory was insufficient to meet the demand. Goods were being prepared for shipment to Shanghai. Towns such as Nanyang and the Philippines made large purchases, and the market price was strong. Therefore, factories can still maintain operations. The actual sales of yuan nails were sluggish. For other goods, buyers stopped ordering and watched, and the market was unchanged.

Other

As for other goods, fuel was stable throughout the week, and only a few showed slight softening on Saturday. Only hemp firewood rose by 100 yuan. Daily necessities lacked momentum and remained weak throughout the week. Solid soap was 39,000 yuan at the beginning of the week and 41,000 yuan at the weekend. Beautiful matches were 550,000 yuan at the beginning of the week and 550,000 yuan on Saturday. Other items such as woolen cloth and Chinese medicine were still weak and fluctuating.

### Brazilian Surplus Grain

100,000 Tons of Corn, Also 90,000 Tons of Rice and Sugar

[Reported by This Newspaper] It has recently been rumored that Brazil has a surplus of 90,000 tons of rice that can be exported. A certain foreign firm in this city is currently selling it. If the transaction is successful, the first batch can be delivered in 40 days. Yesterday, Reuters reported from Rio de Janeiro on the 18th that the Brazilian authorities recently reported that the country's surplus of 8,000,000 tons of corn and rice can slightly alleviate the critical world food shortage. If the surplus grain cannot be shipped due to insufficient transportation, Brazil will keep it for its own use and reduce imports of flour and wheat. It seems that the above news is not without basis.

### First Batch of Siamese Rice Has Been Shipped, Totaling 300,000 Tons

Rice prices are soaring, and the whole city is in a state of panic. The Ministry of Food previously ordered 300,000 tons of foreign rice from Siam. Last week, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haitong Wheel left Shanghai for Haiphong to load the rice. The first batch of 7,000 tons has been shipped from there to China and will arrive in Shanghai in a few days. The remaining 190,000 tons of foreign rice are expected to arrive soon. The authorities will also send additional large-scale ships to load the rice.

### On the Management of Domestic Remittances: The Purpose Is to Prevent Hot Money from Entering Shanghai

[Huadong News Agency] The Central Bank believes that domestic remittances are of great importance to Shanghai's financial and industrial markets. Too much hot money flowing in from other provinces can lead to fluctuations in finance and commodity prices. In order to prevent this trend, the Central Bank is planning to strengthen the management of domestic commercial remittance business. However, the business of domestic commercial remittance is handled by major commercial banks. It is reported that the Central Bank has held preliminary discussions with the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and other banks.

### Commodity Prices Are Rising, Coal Briquettes Are the Only Ones Declining, Three More Ships of Hongji Coal Dust Continue to Arrive

Amidst the skyrocketing rice prices, fuel prices are the most stable. Recently, the number of coal shipments from Qinhuangdao Kai Coal Mine to Shanghai has increased sharply. They are all evenly distributed to various production institutions by the Fuel Committee. Therefore, coal prices have tended to stabilize. As for the raw material Hongji white coal dust for making coal briquettes, production has recently resumed due to the resolution of the labor strike at the Hongji Coal Mine in Annam. In the past week, three shipments have arrived in Shanghai and have been allocated to various coal briquette factories by the Fuel Committee. As the raw material problem has been solved, production in each factory will be restored to pre-war levels. Therefore, the price of coal briquettes has been declining recently. It once rose to 10,000 yuan per dan, but now each factory is selling at a reduced price of 7,000 yuan.

### Enemy Property Bureau Suppresses Sugar Prices, Continues to Tender for Miscellaneous Sugar

The Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau has entrusted the Ministry of Food and the Customs to tender for the enemy and puppet miscellaneous grains, corn flour, etc. multiple times. Due to the serious food shortage in Shanghai, it has decided to entrust the above-mentioned agencies to continue tendering for a large quantity of goods in order to help suppress grain prices.

### Large Number of Automobiles Put Up for Tender

The relevant authorities in this city have taken over a large number of enemy and puppet automobiles, which are currently stored in the open space on the left side of Qiujiang Road and the Xianle Ballroom on Nanjing Middle Road. The Highway Administration Bureau believes that they have been stored for a long time and are vulnerable to wind and rain. Therefore, it recently put up for tender the first batch of 190 various automobiles and a large number of accessories. It was jointly purchased by Yanhua Industrial and Jianzhong Trading, two companies in this city. There are many types of vehicles, including Ford, Buick, Studebaker, Lincoln, Dodge, Morris, Standard, Packard, Fiat, Citroen, Chevrolet, and other brands. There are also ten LaSalle insurance cars, trucks, and jeeps. It is said that most of the cars are in good condition and can be driven once assembled. In order to facilitate the purchasers' licensing, the Highway Administration Bureau has sent a letter to the Municipal Public Works Bureau for record, allowing them to obtain new licenses.

### Iranian Rice Ban Not Relaxed

Reuters, Tehran, 19th: The Iranian Ministry of Commerce announced that the Iranian cabinet is currently discussing the export of rice and that, pending a decision, merchants in this region and Lekht are still not allowed to export rice.

### United States Begins International Trade Week from Yesterday, Calling for the Promotion of World Trade and Prosperity Based on the Principles of Fair Trade

[United States Information Service, Washington, 18th] May 19th to 25th is US International Trade Week. US Secretary of State Byrnes and Secretary of Commerce Wallace both issued statements calling on the people of the country to promote world trade based on the principles of fair trade in order to ensure world peace and prosperity. International Trade Week is sponsored by the US Chamber of Commerce, and all US associations and international trade groups are participating in the campaign to stimulate the American people's awareness of international trade. Another important step taken by the United States to promote international trade cooperation is the proposal to convene a United Nations International Trade and Employment Conference, as well as to negotiate and conclude trade agreements with more than 14 countries and expand international air routes. The United States will also hold Maritime Day on the 22nd of this month. Maritime Day is to commemorate the sailing of the first American ship (Savannah) to cross the Atlantic Ocean on May 22, 1819. At the same time, the US Shipping Commission is studying and publishing a plan for US shipping business. According to this plan, the US merchant fleet will have at least 1,000 ocean-going vessels with a total tonnage of 10.5 million tons.

Secretary of Commerce Wallace declared: The United States can now supply the world's needs and revitalize all post-war undertakings. Therefore, the United States is eager to engage in this business, but this requires all nations of the world to freely exchange products and raw materials in order to achieve its full success. The essential point is that we should not aim at international trade for the purpose of dumping surplus materials and reducing unemployed workers, but should take it as our duty to supply the needs of other countries.

### Silkworm Loans Released Today, Spring Cocoons Opened for Sale in Succession

The 20 billion yuan spring cocoon loan for the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui began to be processed last week. Currently, more than a dozen silk manufacturers have been approved by the Loan Syndication Management Committee and are now decided to be released starting today. All approved silk manufacturers can designate the loan remittance location for payment. It is reported that the amount of loans requested by these factories ranges from a maximum of 1 billion yuan to a minimum of 100 million yuan. This year's sericulture in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces is slightly affected by the weather conditions, which are not warm enough. According to silkworm farmers who came to Shanghai from Wuxi and Suzhou, new cocoons have been appearing on the market in various sericulture areas. Silk cocoon merchants from all over the world have been setting up shops and opening for sale in the producing areas. Although the harvest of new cocoons is slightly less than ideal, the quality of the cocoons is still not bad. Currently, new cocoons from Weian in Zhejiang have been listed and opened for sale, with an initial sale price of 65,000 yuan per dan. New cocoons in the Hangxian and Yuhang areas will be opened for sale in succession this week. New cocoons in the Wuxi, Suzhou, Changzhou, and Jintan areas of Jiangsu Province are expected to be opened for sale in the coming days. It is estimated that the minimum harvest of spring cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces this year will be 200,000 dan.

### American-Italian Petroleum Always Insufficient for Self-Sufficiency

[United Press, Rome, 18th] With global oil reserves dwindling, geologists are shifting their hopeful gaze to the United States. Mobil Oil of New Jersey was the first to contact the Italian government, and other companies have also expressed interest. A year after the 1859 Pennsylvania strike, oil was also discovered in Italy, making it the second country in the world to discover oil. People in the ancient Roman Empire knew how to use natural gas to light lamps. Even so, the production of American oil has always been low. From the year of oil production in 1860 to 1945, the total output was only 3,500,000 barrels (each barrel is equivalent to 42 US gallons). For previous "normal years", such as 1939, this number only covered 13% of the national consumption. Currently, about 100,000 barrels are produced annually, 90% of which comes from the Enirelia region in the north.

### Economic Briefs

The Shanghai branch of the CNRRA has already begun distributing cod liver oil and milk powder. The branch has scheduled a reception for the city's press tomorrow morning to tour the distribution stations and observe the distribution process.

The price of third-class tickets for the Shanghai-Songhu line at the North Railway Station in this city will increase from $20 to $300 per ticket, effective immediately. The first train of the day will depart from Shanghai towards Songhu at 6:30 AM.

From Tianjin: The Tianjin office of the Economic Ministry's Special Commissioner for the Hebei-Jehol-Chahar-Suiyuan Area, in order to support the recovery and development of privately-owned factories and mines in this city, has organized a loan of 1.5 billion yuan. It is reported that more than 400 applicants have applied, and the Social Affairs Bureau has completed its investigation. Once the Economic Ministry's Review Committee completes its review and decides on the loan amounts, the funds will be allocated to the municipal government for re-lending.

From Hangzhou: To promote mutual connections between provincial banks across the country, the National Local Bank Joint Conference has held four meetings to discuss connection methods. It is reported that this year's Local Bank Joint Conference will be jointly convened by the Zhejiang Local Bank and the Fujian Provincial Bank, scheduled to be held in Hangzhou in early June, lasting approximately four days.

### No Re-Imposition of Factory Tax: Statement from the Shanghai Commodity Tax Bureau

To the Editor,

Having read Mr. Zhu Shangyi's article, "The Issue of Commodity Tax and Business Tax in the Dyeing and Weaving Industry," published in your newspaper on May 6th, there are significant discrepancies with the facts. Herein is a brief explanation of the relevant parts of this Bureau:

The original article states: "...Therefore, it goes without saying that pure weaving factories should not pay factory tax for their cotton cloth production. For those that both spin and weave, the spun part should be subject to the unified tax, while the woven part should absolutely not bear the unified tax. This is also a self-evident explanation. As for the fact that the factory tax is levied on cotton cloth when it leaves the factory for the convenience of tax collection, it should be levied ad valorem based on the yarn content of each piece of cotton cloth, and should not include weaving labor costs and weaving profits..." and also mentions "...However, it is said that resident tax collectors of the non-pure weaving factories often levy the unified cotton yarn tax on the spun part of the factory, and then levy the cotton cloth factory tax on the woven part. Regardless of whether there is a legal basis for this, even if it is said to be a strict tax collection measure that cannot be avoided, after the cotton cloth leaves the factory and the tax is paid, one can apply for a refund of the unified cotton yarn tax. However, it is difficult to say whether the amount of the cotton cloth factory tax is levied ad valorem based on the actual yarn content of each piece of cotton cloth." To summarize the preceding and following points, it implies that after the cotton yarn factory tax is levied, the factory tax is also levied on the finished cotton yarn woven product. As for the method of taxing the finished woven product, it is questionable whether it is based on the yarn weight content or includes labor costs and profits. According to the Commodity Unified Tax Regulations, once the cotton yarn factory tax is levied, it is valid throughout the country and will not be taxed again. Therefore, this Bureau collects cotton yarn tax by sending personnel to reside in various yarn factories, and never collects it again from weaving factories. Cotton yarn that is directly woven into finished products can be transported based on the original cotton yarn tax payment certificate or distribution permit, according to the possible amount of finished products produced, in exchange for a pure weaving factory cotton yarn direct woven product transportation permit, without further taxation. It is not the case that cotton yarn tax is levied first and then cotton cloth tax is levied. Those who are taxed on woven finished products are only taxed purely based on the weight of the yarn content of the finished woven product. Labor costs, profits, etc., are naturally not included in the calculation. However, the so-called collection of unified tax on woven finished products here refers to the woven finished product inventory at the time of the city's recovery. Because that inventory, regardless of whether it was taxed during the enemy and puppet period, should be considered untaxed goods and uniformly supplemented. This is stipulated by the General Outline of Tax Collection Measures for Recovered Areas promulgated by the Ministry. If cotton yarn has already been taxed at the factory, before the pure weaving factory transportation permit is issued by the Ministry, and the woven finished product cannot be exchanged for a pure weaving factory transportation permit, if merchants are eager to transport and sell it, and voluntarily pay the unified tax on the woven finished product again to expedite the process, they can also apply for a refund based on the original cotton yarn tax payment certificate afterward. It is not a double tax. The original article says: "In order to facilitate export, weaving factories often pay the cotton cloth factory tax separately in order to comply." This is probably the misunderstanding that arises because of this. As for the issue of the distribution form, a detailed interpretation of the meaning seems to refer to the pure weaving factory transportation permit. Because the distribution form (the correct term is distribution permit) has never been abolished, and its function is to distribute goods or change the place of delivery based on the original tax payment certificate. For example, if the original tax payment certificate states 100 pieces of cotton yarn, sold in this city or transported to Guangzhou, and now 10 pieces need to be transported to Hankou, 10 pieces need to be transported to Chongqing, and the remaining 80 pieces are still sold in this city or Guangzhou, then the original tax payment certificate can be requested for distribution as above. This method has been in place for a long time and has not been abolished. It can be seen that the distribution form mentioned in the original article often refers to the transportation permit for pure weaving factories, in other words, it is commonly known as "exchanging yarn documents for cloth documents." This pure weaving factory transportation permit has long been reissued by this Bureau, but merchants may not be fully aware of it, so misunderstandings are inevitable.

In short, this Bureau handles tax affairs in accordance with established regulations. If there are any shortcomings, we sincerely welcome criticism and instructions from all walks of life. Therefore, we will explain Mr. Zhu Shangyi's misunderstandings to clarify the record and hope that you will

grant us the favor of publishing it.

Respectfully,

Shanghai Commodity Tax Bureau, Ministry of Finance

### A Midsummer Night's Dream in Hangzhou

— Hangzhou Correspondence, 15th, Lin

By the time I arrived in Hangzhou, the season for spring outings had passed. I didn't get to see the "one peach tree next to another" on Su Causeway, and the sound of oars in the lotus bushes on West Lake hadn't yet arrived. Between spring and summer, I saw the true face of Hangzhou.

Legendary City

Hangzhou is inherently a city for tourism. This small city is nestled at the foot of the mountains and along the lake, having attracted countless tourists both ancient and modern. Historically, it served as the capital of the Southern Song Dynasty, leaving behind tales worthy of song and tears. To harmonize with its mountains and waters, the three legends of the White Snake Lady and Xu Xian, Tang Bohu and Qiu Xiang, plus the Living Buddha Jigong, are worth listening to endlessly. Geographically, Hangzhou boasts the West Lake and its surrounding hills, the snow-like Qiantang River tidal bores in the mornings and evenings. These waters, mountain peaks, streams, forests, and temples are enough to keep you lingering for thirty days, and you still won't be able to visit them all. Once you've set foot in Hangzhou, you'll find plenty to do for sightseeing and enjoying the scenery.

People who live in Hangzhou don't appreciate the value of sightseeing because they grow up surrounded by scenery. Eight years ago, when Japanese invaders attacked this scenic area, the people of Hangzhou, young and old, universally toured the mountains and waters on the outskirts of the city. But at that time, everyone was carrying bags, baskets, and helping the elderly and the young, leaving their homes. Although they had the mind to linger over the scenery of their hometown, the scenery did not keep people, so they had to abandon their homes and flee to other places. Even now, eight years later, there are still many Hangzhou natives who went to other places and have yet to return.

West Lake Tour Boats

We checked into a mid-priced lakeside hotel, which, along with the West Lake Hotel, the Die Lai Hotel, and the Cangzhou Hotel, all benefit from being located along the lake. Therefore, when washing away the dust of travel with West Lake water in my room upstairs, West Lake, with its shimmering waves, backed by the green mountains on the northeast shore, was calling out to me with swaying white canopy tour boats. For the past eight years, I had been poisoned by the Central News Agency's telegram at the time of their retreat: "A lake of lonely mountains, all the tour boats sunk to the bottom of the lake." I thought that West Lake had no tour boats and that they had all been sunk during the retreat eight years ago. This scene was just as stubbornly familiar as being surprised by the unchanged situation in Shanghai.

Many new West Lake tour boats have been built in the past eight years. Together with the original old boats, there are 350 in total. Their style has been unified, light and flat, with the same shape at the bow and stern. There are two boatmen, sitting at the bow and stern, rowing. In the middle section of the cabin, there are sofas facing each other, with backrests. Four people can sit facing each other, with a small round table in the middle for tea. When it rains or the sun is strong, a flat-topped awning with white cloth and red edges is erected for shade. When the wind blows, a curtain surrounds your lower body, without obstructing your view, but protecting you from the wind. These tour boats cost 2,000 yuan per hour, 8,000 yuan for half a day, and 13,000 yuan for a full day. It seems expensive, but if calculated in terms of the current food, accommodation, and the actual value of the legal tender in Hangzhou, it is not an "extortionate" price. The boatmen are all strong young men. Of the 350 tour boats, only fifty or sixty are moored on the lake each day (the area of Hubin Road is called "Qixia" by Hangzhou people, the place where the Manchurian Bannermen lived in the past). In reality, the boatmen have to wait for customers for six days to earn a day's labor of 13,000 yuan. The lake is raining with fallen flowers, and the situation is changing. Only one-sixth of the tour boats are rented out each day. The boatmen can only watch the passing tourists more lonely, and are too lazy to shout "Want a boat ride?"

Outwardly Strong, Inwardly Weak

A manager, who transitioned from officialdom to business and opened an international cinema in Hangzhou, analyzed the reasons for Hangzhou's outwardly strong but inwardly weak situation in his sofa living room. "The war is over, and the country has gained victory and face, but the people are empty. Hangzhou itself is like its mountains, waters, temples, waiting for tourists from other places to give alms and spend money, but it does not have the power to prosper itself. People from other places, after the turmoil of war, are all busy with their own livelihoods. Who has the leisure and money to come here to spend? Coupled with the inconvenience of transportation and the continuous warfare, apart from a few thousand wealthy families in Shanghai who can take time off to spend some money, there are no other customers who come here to inquire."

His words were very insightful. During my week in Hangzhou, I toured the lake with a quick, three-hour, horse-riding style tour for 6,000 yuan. The boatman hoped that I could go up to the scenic spots along the lake that we passed to see them, but I told him without hesitation to "row on!" Don't listen to "Willow Waves Listening to Orioles," don't look at the ruins of "Leifeng Pagoda at Sunset," and I didn't go to "Sheng Zhuang," where Chairman Chiang stayed when he came to Hangzhou. I only asked the boatman to row to the "Three Pools Mirroring the Moon" and the Huxin Pavilion in the center of the lake, which can only be reached by boat. I found that most of the new tourists were calculating like me, equally spoiling the scenery. Some even refused to stay on the lake for three hours, only making a one-way trip to the Three Pools Mirroring the Moon and then returning.

Waterfront Tea Houses

During the hurried tour, only the tea houses at Jiuqi Tea Plantation in the Nine Creeks and Eighteen Gullies, and in front of Lingyin Temple, and the tea house at Pinghu Qiuyue were the most attractive to tourists and made them reluctant to leave. These three places are all located near gurgling streams. The tender green tea made from the new Longjing green leaves on the tea seats makes tourists truly swallow the mountains and waters of Hangzhou. (Longjing tea is the tender leaves of tea trees on the mountains of Hangzhou, and the boiling water is made from West Lake water.) Thrifty tourists drink the tea cup by cup, turning the green juice into yellow water, until the tea becomes white water, before standing up and leaving reluctantly.

In order to see West Lake day and night, I was not stingy and stayed in a hotel at the city station or in the city, but instead greedily watched the different colors at different times from the lakeside building next to her. I love West Lake because such good mountains and waters exist naturally. In my chaotic life, she has only been close to me twice, each time for a short period of less than seven days. In Sichuan for seven years, I vowed to return to my hometown of Jiangnan and be with West Lake. I finally crossed thousands of mountains and waters to see West Lake, satisfying my desire to face West Lake.

Chatting About the Seawall

I have the fault of caring about people's livelihoods and like to hear about undertakings related to people's livelihoods. In Hangzhou, I took the time to visit Sun Xiaolou of the Zhejiang-Fujian Branch of the CNRRA, and his inspection director Zhang Zhongyu, and talked about the repair of the Zhejiang seawall as follows:

The Zhejiang seawall is divided into two parts: the North Seawall and the South Seawall. The North Seawall starts from Hangzhou City, passes through Haining, Haiyan, and reaches Zhapu Town in Pinghu, connecting to the seawall of Jinshan County in Jiangsu Province, a total of more than 200 kilometers. Due to the relationship between sea currents and wind direction, the Qiantang River tidal bore always beats against the north shore seawall. After eight years of disrepair, there are eleven gaps in the north shore, some only one or two zhang wide, and some one mile wide, with the most gaps in Haining County. The erosion holes in Haiyan County are also numerous, but have not yet reached the scale of gaps. The South Seawall only includes Xiaoshan and Shaoxing counties, which are shorter than the North Seawall. Usually, it is only subjected to the Jianghai tide bounced back from the north shore, so the threat is smaller than that of the north shore. Both seawalls were built in the Song Dynasty. The technology and construction methods of civil engineering at that time were naturally limited. It was never thought that thousands of years later, descendants would still rely on the power of their ancestors to provide water resistance protection. Therefore, although repairs have been carried out over the years, they collapse every year when the lake water rises, and are repaired every year. During the eight years of the Hangzhou War, the Japanese, like all the public works in the occupied areas, did not care about the consequences of disrepair. Therefore, the problems accumulated over eight years must be cured before the autumn tide of August 18th this year. After Sun Xiaolou took office in Hangzhou, he inspected the North Seawall twice, and also visited the South Seawall. Chen Zhongyu said that the young and strong American Mei engineer in his office is a true seawall expert. He was specially transferred by the CNRRA from the Panama Canal Zone to this place of excellent scenery for this matter.

Seawall Repair Plan

The Zhejiang-Fujian Branch already has a plan in mind for the seawall, and has found during the inspection: (1) For areas that have sunk – make immediate minor repairs; (2) Gaps – eleven on the south shore and thirteen on the north shore – make major repairs; (3) Areas that are firm but may be scoured or cause gaps – make immediate pre-repairs.

The seawall project began on February 25th this year in Haining County, where there are the most gaps, under the leadership of Chairman Zhu of the county council. The Zhejiang-Fujian Branch supplied 105 tons of flour as work food and 2 million yuan of cement as work materials. The entire major repair project began on May 5th and is scheduled to be completed before the autumn floods, with a cost of 60 billion yuan. The Zhejiang Provincial Administrative Yuan and the Zhejiang-Fujian Branch each contribute one-third, but the Branch supplies 20 billion yuan of work materials, such as flour and cement, which will not be affected by the depreciation of legal tender and rising prices. If the other two-thirds are legal tender, the phenomenon of insufficiency will inevitably occur again as time goes on.

The seawall is a dike built of stones and wood. The surface of the dike is six feet wide, with one foot wide of stones on the outermost side, two feet wide of stones on the surface inside, wood below, and three feet wide of mixed soil on the innermost side. Therefore, although the stones are strong, they are often thrown into the dike from the bottom of the water by the sea tide. Large stones, as large as tables, are actually pebbles in the giant palm of the sea tide. The total transformation into a mixed soil seawall project costs more than several hundred billion yuan, which cannot be held this year, but in order to protect the fertile rice-producing land on the two deltas of the Qiantang River and the Yangtze River from being flooded by saline seawater, this huge seawall construction project must be held. In the midst of turmoil, these are what deserve attention. But now people's eyes and thoughts are not on this, how can those who are accompanied by this kind of business day and night not be anxious? Director Sun Xiaolou is worried that once the rice-producing area is irrigated with salt water, the soil will not be able to grow rice for three to ten years, and the consequences will destroy the paradise of Suzhou and Hangzhou and create a new hell! Fortunately, major repairs to the gaps in the seawall can withstand this year's autumn lake, who can plan for next year's affairs? I want to ask the central government to take action as soon as possible.

### The 5th Air Force Group, Seasoned in Battle, Guarding the Capital

— Nanjing Correspondence, 17th, Zhu Minwei

The Air Force stationed in the capital is the famous Zhijiang 5th Group, which is currently participating in the capital's large-scale exercise. A month ago, the 5th Group sent aircraft to perform low-altitude flying over Beijing and Shanghai, among which the ultra-low-altitude chase program was particularly startling to the audience. At that time, the aircraft were about five zhang above the ground. Because the speed of the P-51 fighter was very high, it flew very fast at low altitude, and the roofs shook wherever it passed.

### Renowned at Home and Abroad for Distant Expeditions

Zheng Songyu, the Group Commander of the 5th Group, is a veteran general transferred from the 3rd Group. The Deputy Group Commander, Xiang Shiduan, is a veteran fighter of the 5th Group. He has been in the 5th Group for eight years, and has experienced hundreds of battles. His experience is quite extraordinary. In 1938, he graduated from the 8th class of the Aviation School and joined the 5th Group as a pilot, and began serving in the Northwest, as far as Hami. In 1940, he fought over Chengdu and Chongqing. In 1942, he rushed to aid Burma and was stationed at the Lashio Airport to protect the 200th Division armored forces of Du Yuming who entered Burma to assist the British army in resisting Japan. He once made a forced landing in Pyawbwe (en route from Lashio to Yangon) when the aircraft was damaged, escaped from the enemy area in a Burmese oxcart, and returned to our military territory. Later, he retreated into Yunnan with the army, and used [missing type] 15 Type 3 [missing type] fighter aircraft to defend against the invading enemy at low altitude along the Baoshan to Bhamo line in western Yunnan, killing many enemies. This was the revival of low-altitude attacks on enemy ground combat by our country's fighter jets. Later, the United States aided us, and Xiang Shiduan went to India with the team to receive training on P-40 fighter aircraft. He flew a P-40 aircraft three times from Karachi on the Indian Ocean coast back to China over the Hump. And fought with the enemy. Since the spring of 1944, he has been stationed at Zhijiang Airport in Hunan. He led his troops as the captain of the 17th Squadron of the 57th Group, attacking as far as Wuhan and as close as Changsha and Hengyang every day.

### Wounded by Enemy Bullets, Healed, and Fought Again

In the autumn of 1941, during the Xiangxi War, during an aerial battle after shooting down an enemy plane, he was also surrounded by enemy planes and wounded in the back by bullets. Because he was healthy, he was healed and returned to the sky to fight. He destroyed countless enemy vehicles and supplies on the ground, blew up bridges, and annihilated enemy soldiers, lasting for a year. In May 1945, the enemy attacked Zhijiang in western Hunan again. Above the famous Xuefeng Mountain, Xiang Shiduan led the team with Commander Zhang Tangtian to attack the enemy's positions every day, killing more than 8,000 invading enemies, which led to the subsequent great victory in western Hunan, and the enemy army was defeated since then.

### Led Several Members Deep into Enemy Lines

He considers his most satisfying achievement to be in June 1945, when he led the 17th Squadron across the Yuehan Railway line occupied by the enemy and stationed at Chaling Airport, which was surrounded on all sides. In this campaign, he brought eight flight capable members and six P51 fighters. The runway at Chaling Airport was 1,000 meters long, and the P51 could barely take off fully loaded. At that time, the enemy was already withdrawing from Guangzhou to Nanchang, and from Liuzhou and Guilin to Changsha and Yueyang every day. They took off and landed between the two enemy retreat lines, specializing in bombing and shooting the retreating enemy motorcades and wooden boat fleets, and achieved great results. A total of 100 enemy wooden boats and about 100 vehicles were sunk. In this campaign, the US military was solely responsible for supply, using three transport aircraft to transport oil, ammunition, and supplies. Although Chaling was a dilapidated village, it was quite spirited to have markings such as S.M.S.O painted on the walls of the dilapidated houses. The US military often said: "We are the Sino-US cooperative air guerrilla team." Everyone's daily life, because it was in the countryside battlefield, was almost in the primitive era, and the custom of grabbing and eating roasted chicken legs was prevalent. There was a green small river near the airport. After returning from battle, everyone first took off their clothes and swam in the river to cool off and restore their tense bodies.

### Swimming Across the Vast Sea Without Fatigue

Xiang Shiduan is from Guangdong. Not only is he meticulous and steady in flying, but he also loves swimming. Years ago, when I traveled with him to Mount Emei for the summer, he was traveling from Chengdu to Mount Emei. On the way, he encountered a large river. While the car was being ferried across, he, along with the then Fifth Squadron Commander, Zeng Dachi, swam across the river, covering a distance of two to three thousand meters without tiring. In society, he is usually courteous, but his nature loves the unrestrained life of primitive society. The Fifth Air Force Squadron, under his assistance and the command of Squadron Leader Zheng, protects the capital! It can be said that the work is progressing daily. (The photo is a recent portrait of Deputy Squadron Leader Xiang.) He rarely goes out, except to handle squadron affairs in the barracks at the Daxiaochang training ground. He only goes on hikes to scenic spots on holidays.

### Deputy Squadron Leader Xiang Shirui – A Shocking Suicide Case Amidst the Reorganization of the Jiangxi Provincial Government

— Nanchang, 12th Dispatch, Jiang Zhaoran

The reorganization of the Jiangxi Provincial Government is a major restructuring of the era. For those involved (committee members, heads, committee members and secretary-general): Among the six people, only two are suitable for their respective positions. One of them is Cheng Maoxing, a committee member and director of the Land and Food Department. Cheng is from Xinjian County in Jiangxi Province, and is 51 years old this year. He has served as a commissioner in Sichuan Province and as a deputy minister in the grain department. He returned to Jiangxi last August, succeeding Hu Zhaozhao as a member of the provincial government and director of the Land and Food Department. Cheng's continued appointment to these positions was generally seen as an indication of the central government's great reliance on Cheng, which Cheng should have considered an honor. Unexpectedly, two days after the news of the provincial government's reorganization was published in the newspaper (April 10th), Cheng suddenly committed suicide in Ji'an. It turned out that Cheng was ordered on April 6th to set off from the province to various counties along the Gan River to urge the purchase of surplus grain and supervise the transport of stored grain. He found that there was a severe shortage of grain boats along the way, and residents in disaster areas stated that there was no surplus grain available for purchase due to the period between harvests. At the same time, Cheng checked the actual amount of grain stored in each county and found that it was very little, vastly different from the figures reported to the province. As a result, Cheng was worried and angry, and extremely distressed. After arriving in Ji'an, at around 2:00 PM on the 10th, he used "taking a walk" as an excuse, taking only one attendant with him. He went to the edge of Bailu Pool, and taking advantage of the attendant's inattention, jumped into the water. The water was deep and turbulent. By the time the attendant noticed and jumped into the water to try to save him, he had already become a "god of the waves." Cheng left a pair of suicide notes before his death, which were found afterwards. The gist of the notes was that various parties were demanding grain, but the counties had no grain, and there were very few grain boats. There was no way to think of a solution, so he could only commit suicide to repay the country and apologize to the people.

After the news of Cheng's suicide spread throughout Nanchang, there was much speculation from various parties, but this reporter should not engage in any speculation. I will just say one thing: This is a shocking suicide case!

From right to left: Lai Yi, Bei…Na…

### The Doorkeeper of the World – United Nations Secretary-General Lai Yi

— Specially Translated by this Newspaper's Translation Department

In the early days of the United Nations Organization, many people expressed reliance on it. When the Security Council was about to convene, several unfortunate twists and turns occurred, and the beliefs of these people were inevitably shaken. The issue of Israel was an emergency, the first difficult hurdle that the United Nations Organization had to find a way to overcome. But people with unwavering faith believed that the United Nations Organization would be able to overcome obstacles and reach the path of peace. One of them is Lai Yi, the Secretary-General of the Organization, a strong-willed and pragmatic Norwegian lawyer.

### Absolutely International, Unaffected by Anything

As Secretary-General of the United Nations Organization, Lai Yi can be called the world's first internationalist. According to the United Nations Charter, he can bring to the attention of the Security Council anything he believes threatens international peace and security. According to the Charter, his responsibility is "absolutely international," and he is not affected by any country in the United Nations in his duties. He can truly be regarded as the doorkeeper of the world.

His primary task is to manage the United Nations Organization. He is the chief administrative officer of the Organization, and in this capacity, he presides over various meetings of the General Assembly, the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council, and the Trusteeship Council, and must perform other tasks entrusted to him by these bodies. Lai Yi readily accepts tasks beyond his own, which is a demonstration of his amazing abilities.

### He Needs Talent and Employs Competent Personnel

According to the rules established by the General Assembly, Lai Yi may appoint all staff of the Secretariat and assign appropriate personnel to the Economic and Social Council and the Trusteeship Council. This not only requires extraordinary talent, but also requires painstaking research and consideration. As he himself said: "We often employ whoever we meet first, but I think it is best to decide slowly, so that the people we employ are competent. It is better to be cautious beforehand than to rush into things and then realize after two or three months that we have employed the wrong person. Because at that time, moving one or two people will completely subvert the entire department."

The selection of staff should be based on two principles: first, to seek the highest standards of efficiency, talent and integrity; second, to ensure that the staff employed are widely distributed among the member states. Lai Yi acknowledges that adhering to these two standards in selecting staff is certainly costly, but he firmly insists that it is a necessary condition.

With the consent of the Security Council, Lai Yi may notify the United Nations General Assembly of any matter discussed by the Security Council relating to the maintenance of world peace and security; when the Security Council ceases to discuss such matters, he must also notify the General Assembly in the same way, or, if the General Assembly is in recess, notify the member states of the United Nations.

Therefore, from the point of view of selecting and directing combatants, Lai Yi's power is very great, practically equivalent to a dictator. But in terms of Lai's authority over the delegations of various countries, his task is that of a coordinator, not a director.

When the United Nations General Assembly and Security Council first met in London, Lai Yi's public activities were not particularly noteworthy. He did not serve as chairman; he quietly attended meetings and quietly withdrew. Indeed, if it were not for the somewhat tense expression on his face, people would have regarded this shadowy figure sitting in the meeting place as a detective. Lai Yi, like Attlee, is most popular in the committees. His sincere attitude, firm will, and fair handling of issues give people a good impression. He is not the typical figure who is easily exploited politically, and he does not have the moving gestures of an orator. However, he possesses the virtue that the world and the United Nations Organization need.

At the age of fifty, Lai Yi is a commoner who speaks out for the common people of the world and dedicates himself to their cause. His intelligence and talent are far above the average person, but in the past seven years, he has encountered the physical and mental dangers that the average European has encountered. His experience has not only given him a sense of closeness to the people of Western Europe, but also to the people of the world.

### Complex Personality, Knows How to Handle Situations

There are many contradictory aspects of Lai's personality that are worth studying. A famous Frenchman criticized Lai as "a proletarian with brightly shined shoes," which is a superficial observation, but it does point out two contradictory points in Lai's character: he is a proletarian, but in the complex international arena, he knows how to work and how to cope.

There are few gray areas in Lai's character. He is black and white. Strong will is probably his most prominent characteristic. He has the shrewd thinking and strong will of an ordinary farmer, and he works with Norway's top lawyers. But this strong will is tempered by genuine friendship. He can treat his friends and subordinates with great affection and loyalty, but he can also fly into a rage, startling his companions, but sometimes this brightens up a dull situation.

### New Job, Inclined to Always Speak Frankly and Openly

In recent years, he has learned to curb his anger and his tendency to talk casually about his work. Now, he exudes a gentle and amiable attitude. His face is long and round, and he often breaks into a smile. He often gestures with his hands and tries to maintain a graceful posture.

His gradually fattening and large frame is usually dressed in blue clothing. He also understands the customary small talk at cocktail parties in the diplomatic arena, although, like most officials in the British Labor government, he does not like this social custom. Many people intend to decorate the new headquarters of the United Nations Organization, but Lai Yi opposes it. He is in favor of simplicity, frankness, and openness.

Before he set off for the United States, he said to people: "I hope that we can show by facts that we are serving the interests of the people everywhere in the world and will never use the diplomatic tricks of the past."

Throughout his life, Lai Yi has witnessed thousands of problems being resolved through negotiations and discussions. He advocates using internal or external discussion methods to resolve international problems. Lai Yi's own debating skills have been honed in government committees, courts, and Norwegian political party debates. He has discussed world affairs with Norwegian sailors and British soldiers, and listened to the calls of people helping to build a new world.

### Mother Opened an Apartment, Listening to Union Debates

Lai Yi began to get involved in society in the industrial area outside Oslo. His mother opened a small apartment there. At that time, he was still a schoolboy. In his spare time after school, he often heard Swedish syndicalists and Norwegian trade union members arguing in the apartment.

Lai Yi couldn't bear to see his mother toiling so hard, so he resolved to become famous and successful. In 1914, he entered the University of Oslo, but after leaving school, he did not enter the business world, but joined the Norwegian Labor Party and became close to Jorgensen, the daughter of the local military station chief.

In addition to immersing himself in books and politics, Lai Yi also became a famous football and track and field athlete at the University of Oslo. However, by the time he obtained his law degree, he had already become the private secretary of Tranmæl, the secretary of the Norwegian Labor Party. In 1921, he and Jorgensen married and went to Moscow as the secretary of the Labor Party delegation. It was during this visit that Lai Yi heard Lenin's speech.

The following year, he became the legal advisor to the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions, a position he held for thirteen years. In addition to handling court cases, he also wrote many explanatory pamphlets. He held moderate views on labor policy. As his political activities expanded, his circle of friends also expanded. Soon, the young labor lawyer's friends in Vance Conden were almost as numerous as his friends in the Soviet Union. He began to travel throughout Western and Northern Europe. At the same time, the Oslo lawyer began his journey as a citizen of the world.

But in 1935, when he joined the Norwegian government as Minister of Justice, he was merely a capable young man from Oslo. Indeed, his sociable personality, his impatient temper, and his occasional political missteps annoyed some of the key members of the party. One of these key members once said: "I think Lai Yi is a genius six days a week, but on the seventh day, he is just a child."

### Political Character Assessed from Political Views

As for Lai Yi's political character, it is best to assess it from his personal reaction to the two main political ideologies (communism and fascism) prevalent in the first half of the twentieth century. As a socialist, he was very concerned about the progress of Soviet socialism, and at the same time, as a European, he was very excited about the Soviet Union's position as a strong country in Europe and the world. However, because he is a social democrat from Northern Europe, he favors evolution rather than revolution, and because he is a Norwegian and a Western European, he firmly and enthusiastically believes in the various freedoms in the Bill of Rights.

People with such political leanings, namely democratic socialists who believe in socialism, are of course rejected by the highest degree of fascist national socialism. Lai Yi witnessed the German Social Democratic Party being dissolved by the Nazi leader, and their leaders being forced into exile or detention in concentration camps. As a cabinet minister of a country with a population of three million, he was of course helpless in this regard, but we have reason to believe that Lai Yi's current dedication to world peace and human freedom is most stimulated by being on the border of Nazi Germany and witnessing the dark situation in Germany.

One day in September 1939 after the outbreak of war, when Germany invaded Norway, he was managing the most important asset that Norway could contribute to the United Nations: the Norwegian merchant fleet of 3.5 million tons with a crew of 25,000.

In November 1940, Lai Yi became the Norwegian Foreign Minister, which was the stepping stone to his current position, because this position enabled him to have contact not only with the representatives of the great powers in London, but also with the envoys of small countries that had been annexed by Germany.

### Lai Yi's Supporters are the Two Strongest Countries

Lai Yi's current position has aroused general speculation: "Who is supporting him?" This speculation is fruitless, because those supporting Lai Yi happen to be the two most powerful countries. The country that first recommended Lai Yi for an important position in the United Nations Organization was not the Soviet Union, but the United States, contrary to popular belief. In November 1945, the US State Department suggested to the Soviet Union that it nominate Lai Yi as Chairman of the United Nations General Assembly. Later, this position was taken by Spaak, and the Soviet Union then nominated Lai Yi for his current position as Secretary-General.

Now, this Norwegian "leader of the common people" spends his days and nights with the great men of the world, while maintaining close ties with the people. He has the ability to seek welfare for the men and women of the class he came from. His friends scattered in various countries all consider him to be a resolute and courageous fighter for peace and human rights.

### The Responsibilities that Police Officers Should Have

Editor: We are from the cadre training class of the police academy, and it can be said that we are all very pure young people. We have been trained in the capital for a year, and the hardships we have suffered are truly indescribable. It was not until the victory of the War of Resistance that we were ordered to return to the capital. Due to inconvenient transportation, we traveled thousands of miles on foot for three months, enduring dew and rain along the way, and suffering immensely. When we arrived at the capital police academy, we took academic exams and waited to be assigned. Now that the country is being built, the first priority is to rebuild the police force. The central government, recognizing the need to improve the quality of the police, has promulgated a new police system, using the police district as the basic unit for implementing duties, starting in Beijing and Shanghai and gradually expanding. Therefore, the superiors are using our batch of students to test the new system. Please allow me to use your newspaper to describe our mission and dispel suspicions or misunderstandings from all sectors.

The objects of our service are all citizens, and our mission is to protect the people. The relationship between the people and the police is very close. If there is no police force, society cannot be stable and the people cannot be at peace. If the police are separated from the people, then all duties cannot be discussed. The gain or loss of popular support depends on whether the police can be close to the people. Among the people, the police must play a leading role at all times in order to gain popular support. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, it is even more important to seize popular support and strengthen national construction.

We believe that the police are for all the people, not for a few, and should not be abolished because they are inconvenient for a very small number of people. Then, the police must go deep into the people, think of the people in everything, and plan for the people in every way. Especially since we are new police under the new system of modern China, our style should be completely different, and we should also fulfill the responsibilities of managing, educating, nurturing, and protecting the people. For example:

(Manage) The scope of police management is very wide, so-called, no matter what happens, no matter when it happens, no matter where it happens. In this way, the police should be there for people everywhere. For example, if a tricycle is only allowed to carry two people, the police must manage if it exceeds the regulation and advise him to avoid danger. Also, if people's homes are not closed at 12:00 at night, the police must ask him to close them to avoid theft by thieves. In this way, they should be constantly responsible, exercising the powers of management, so that every person can live and work in peace.

(Teach) The police are the people's teachers, the judges of the streets. Therefore, they must always lead by example and improve society. President Chiang said: "The police teach people, regardless of the pond, regardless of the person, and regardless of the road. They teach order, discipline, and guide people to the paths they should follow, obey, encourage, and avoid." This is to show the police the principles of doing things.

(Nurture) The police are the people's nannies, so in addition to managing and educating the people, they must also truly love and nurture the people. The ancient saying: "Let the old have a place to end their lives, the strong have a place to use their strength, the young have a place to grow, and the widowed, orphaned, and disabled all have a place to be nurtured." This is truly the highest standard for the police to nurture the people. Of course, due to various restrictions, we cannot achieve this level, but we should set this as our goal and truly take on the responsibility of nurturing the people.

(Protect) The greatest responsibility of the police is to protect the lives and property of the people and maintain social order. Therefore, the word "protect" is the most important task of the police. Since the police have the important responsibility of protecting the people, they must have the spirit of sacrifice and struggle, and the determination to eliminate violence and protect the good. To eliminate violence for the people, they will not hesitate to become benevolent and take righteousness. To protect the good for the people, they are determined to brave dangers and overcome difficulties. Only in this way can society be peaceful, and the people can live in peace. This is the police's responsibility to protect the people.

In short, the police must be responsible for the people when performing their duties. The police have the opportunity to exercise their powers in any place, but the most likely shortcomings are abuse of power and abandonment of power. The result of this abuse and abandonment is the main reason for the people's contempt. If the people despise the police's authority, then how can they exercise their powers and how can they advance their work? Therefore, to make the people believe in the authority of the police is the first problem to be solved. The police must always put the interests of the people first and start with being truly responsible when performing their duties. Manage for the people, disperse for the people, nurture for the people, and protect for the people. Do not abandon the powers that should be exercised, and do not abuse the powers that should not be exercised. Only by doing this can they be worthy of being police officers under the new police system. Yuan Shengkui

### The Dark and Gloomy District Chief

Editor: My hometown, Zhujiajiao, is in Qingpu County, a very famous town. During the period of its occupation, it did not suffer from the enemy's devastation on the surface, so it was regarded as a paradise. After the victory, a district chief came. He also served as the district chief of Kunshan County and the principal of a primary school. One person held four or five positions. He created a rice tax, collecting two dou of rice per stone regardless of whether it was bought or sold; he also collected business subsidies, collecting from all households according to the number of people, and if there was a slight delay, he would immediately arrest them and detain them; he established a clean-up office with a false name, taking all the fertilizer from the town without compensation and selling it; he also sheltered opium and gambling (he himself smokes opium), charging fees for each lamp. The bodyguards he hired took their box cannons every day and waited in the four markets for rice boats to pass by, extorting rice taxes. A villager went to town to sell rice, and because he had no money to pay the tax, a conflict arose. The gun was fired and the villager was almost killed, causing the rice shop to strike. The people here are full of complaints. May I disclose this letter so that everyone knows that there is such a dark and gloomy thing happening here? Ge Dejin, May 13th.

### Science Forum: Will the Atomic Bomb Explosion Dry Up the Ocean? Will It Shatter the Atmosphere?

— Translated by Our Newspaper Translation Department

Scientists say: When atomic bombs are tested on the surface of Bikini Atoll this summer, there will be no drying up of the ocean, shattering of the atmosphere, causing earthquakes, or triggering huge tidal waves around the world. However, when the second test bomb, which is designed to explode on or beneath the ocean surface, detonates, various spectacular phenomena are likely to occur immediately within the surrounding waters.

Several Phenomena May Occur

Rear Admiral Thorvald Solberg, who is in charge of the target ship operation during the Bikini atomic bomb tests, said: Explosions on or beneath the water surface will "vaporize seawater into steam-like clouds." At a press conference, Solberg and others described several phenomena that might occur during the atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll:

Seawater Turns into Hydrogen and Oxygen

The millions of degrees of heat generated after the bomb explodes may split the surrounding seawater into its original components: hydrogen and oxygen. When the heat rapidly decreases to 20,000 degrees, the separated hydrogen and oxygen atoms will recombine to form water molecules again. This is the chemical nature of hydrogen and oxygen.

Spectacular Surging Seawater

Therefore, under all possible circumstances, the atomic bomb explosion will create a secondary and potentially colorful explosion, as water molecules regain their original state. Solberg said: This surging of seawater is quite spectacular, but not particularly frightening. He also said: On average, the atomic explosion will boil the seawater over an area of one square mile. "The primary damage to various ships will result less from the high heat than from the shock and blast."

Fleeting Atomic Flash

Rear Admiral Parsons, Deputy Commander of the Test Force, pointed out: When the first test bomb is dropped, some separation of hydrogen and oxygen may occur in the atmospheric layer. The explosion of the atomic bomb several hundred feet above the water surface will create a point of air descent. Parsons also mentioned: When the first atomic bomb was tested in the New Mexico desert on July 16 last year, the intrinsic atomic flash lasted only for "one-thousandth of a second," followed by two fainter "halos," which changed the atomic cloud from purple to pink. These flashes may have been caused by hydrogen and oxygen recombining into water droplets in the air. Parsons concluded that the atomic bomb explosion is unlikely to create a series of core or chemically unimaginable reactions, so it is unlikely to become an unexpectedly destructive monster.

### Suzhou Tidbits

— Our Newspaper Suzhou, 12th Dispatch, Correspondent Wu Shouren

The giant wheels of time are moving forward non-stop, but Suzhou has unfortunately been abandoned in the tracks crushed by the wheels, becoming increasingly isolated from the new era. It has already shown the old age of "the sunset is infinitely beautiful, but alas, it is near dusk."

Eight years of enemy trampling have certainly caused Suzhou to suffer serious internal injuries, and the social conditions after the recovery, such as the insecurity of public order and the corruption of basic-level autonomous administration, are all encounters darker before dawn, calling Suzhou to wear a garment of victory, but ultimately unable to hide the internal scars. Over 1.3 million people struggle on the line of starvation, unable to live in peace and unable to enjoy their work. Looking at this ancient city, one truly feels a sense of unbearable recollection.

Police administration has been tight since the recovery, and remains so now. The pay is meager, and the armed forces are weak. There seems to be no hope of reform in the short term, and local public order has achieved nothing. Robberies and thefts are frequently heard of. Every middle-class resident of Suzhou tightly bolts their doors at night, and unless you speak with a familiar accent, don't even think about visiting your friends in the evening. The police bureau in charge of personnel has been transferred four times in a short eight months. Recently, a provincial order was issued, transferring Zhao Weijun, the police chief of Jiangyin County, to take over, but he has not yet arrived at his post.

In its early days, the County Provisional Assembly showed some new spirit of public opinion. General public opinion expressed great admiration. However, a month has passed, and apart from passing the county budget, there is nothing worth mentioning, and it is very quiet. Public opinion, at this stage of restoring order and lingering in transition, is difficult to get the expected evaluation, which is very regrettable.

Special Production and Construction Edition

### Welcoming Minister Wang Yunwu

— Yi

Recently, the Executive Yuan passed a resolution appointing Mr. Wang Yunwu as the Minister of Economic Affairs. From the standpoint of production and construction, we deeply rejoice at getting the right person.

First, Mr. Yunwu is one of the few domestic experts in scientific management. The most effective function of scientific management is to turn a dying business from defeat to victory, and to make a smooth business flourish. Before implementation, it emphasizes comprehensive planning, and during the implementation process, it focuses on effectiveness and efficiency. In the past, after the January 28th Shanghai Incident, Mr. Yunwu used scientific management methods to complete the revival of the Commercial Press. The environment at that time was very harsh. But as a result, it was ultimately able to increase production and increase profits. At present, China's production industry is fragmented and suffering greatly, so Mr. Yunwu's appointment as the Minister of Economic Affairs can give him an opportunity to display his talents and assume the heavy responsibility of revival.

Second, Mr. Yunwu comes from the private sector and is very familiar with the situation of all private enterprises. In the future, he will certainly be able to seek reasonable solutions to alleviate the suffering of private enterprises without any barriers.

Third, Mr. Yunwu visited the United Kingdom during the war and observed the situation in the UK at that time in great detail. Their perfect system can be implemented in China under the condition of adapting to the national conditions.

Recently, when Mr. Yunwu was interviewed by a reporter from the Central News Agency, he mentioned that "it is people who make things happen" will be his future policy guideline. This point is in line with the principles of scientific management. He himself attaches great importance to efficiency. Some colleagues at the Commercial Press criticized Mr. Yunwu's statement that one only needs five minutes to eat, believing that it was impossible. This is because most people do not pay enough attention to work efficiency. Many people spend too much time on personal matters and too little time on public matters.

We hope that after Mr. Yunwu takes office as the Minister of Economic Affairs, he will be able to gather specialized talents from all aspects, have concrete plans for future policies, and implement them step by step. After a considerable period of time, we will certainly see results.

People who study scientific management feel a special interest in a difficult situation, because opening up a difficult situation and turning it into a smooth and prosperous one can show the talent of a manager. Mr. Yunwu must have the same feeling on this point, so he has affirmed that this appointment as the Minister of Economic Affairs is for doing things, not for being an official. Therefore, we have unlimited hopes for Mr. Yunwu, and we hope that his subordinates will be able to cooperate fully and take on the task of revival.

### New Trends in British Industry and Commerce

— By Claire Neikhd, Translated by Zhou Qinghe

Since the end of the war, countries have been making every effort to develop overseas markets, especially the United Kingdom and the United States. The points mentioned here can serve as a reference for China's industry and commerce. Translator

Whether you buy goods in Brooklyn or Samoa, you can know that the British have begun to promote sales.

They will go to the United States and every other country in the world, they will sell large quantities of bicycles, hair brushes, wireless toasters and Scotch whiskey everywhere, because they only have two paths to take, that is, sell goods or die of economic malnutrition.

Because the Americans have the markets that the British desperately need to acquire, the British are likely to encounter economic death. They understand this very well, so it is not enough to simply manufacture fine goods and sell them at fair prices. They must also become the most astute salesmen in the world. For this purpose, they created an organization called Betor.

Betor is an abbreviation that stands for British Export Trade Research Organization. This organization is practical and does not advocate superficiality. One of the principals once said: "We don't want to talk too much, but this organization, in the eyes of the average Briton, is really very American."

Even in the United States, there are few such large-scale plans. That organization is already prepared to serve as a collection of talents and a propaganda machine for British industry and commerce. Its greatest task will be to find world markets and calculate the needs of people around the world, the needs they will generate, or the needs they can be made to feel, and then sell the goods to them.

In order to accomplish this task, it is necessary to establish a close communication network all over the world and hire experts to preside over it. Those experts will prepare forms based on the actual situation of each place, including local clothing, climate, colors, education, customs, habits, religion, etc. Based on these factual investigations, they can inform the country what to manufacture, where to send it, and what price to set.

They have a strong advertising organization, abbreviated as abprice in English, which is heavily subsidized by the British government. It is based on the best American advertising methods to create advertisements to tell the Turks, Argentinians, and even people around the world that British aspirin is the best medicine for headaches. No advertising medium will be overlooked—newspapers, magazines, radio, movies. A principal in a British Chamber of Commerce said: "We will use all the methods that Americans have used, even high-pressure sales methods."

The entire plan has received great assistance from the British government, although the main income comes from membership fees paid by seventy British manufacturers, and there is capital of 200 million yuan.

This organization was started in the spring of last year. On the one hand, the British business community watched the American businessmen competing for the market, and on the other hand, they watched the domestic situation, and they were indeed a little disappointed. The UK itself has to pay a huge sum, totaling 200 million yuan. Part of it is the previous investment in various places abroad, which has obtained very rich benefits, but since the war broke out, this source of benefits has been temporarily stopped. Part of it is to pay for the cost of the war. Her people are starving, and the machines in the factories are already old and must be replaced. Many pre-war markets have been lost.

Therefore, export is the lifeline of the UK. Only by absorbing money through exports can it cope with the things that need to be imported for living, and the current number has increased. Therefore, even restoring the pre-war market cannot cope. In 1939, the UK exported goods worth 240 million yuan, and now it should only increase its exports by 50%. British merchants have already begun to move towards this goal. According to the chairman of Lloyds Bank, British merchants are indeed working hard, but they are encountering considerable setbacks everywhere, because when the British arrive, they find that the Americans are already there.

A British industrialist once said: "This situation makes us feel like a woman is preparing tea for her husband and going out, her husband has already gone out with a rescued girl, and she has already taken out the coffee sugar bowl."

This competition is quite rapid, but the UK must not be slow, but should catch up quickly. It must improve the machines needed for production, strengthen the sales organization, and then, through the above-mentioned organization, use advertising methods to encourage people from all over the world to buy British goods instead of buying goods from other countries, or not buying goods at all.

Among American businessmen, there is great interest in this kind of work. Commerce Secretary Wallace said that exports are not only necessary work, but also closely related to the American full employment plan, so it is formulated to reach a number of 100 million yuan per year, which is three times the export volume in 1939.

In Europe, which has suffered war losses, a part of the number can be occupied, but in order to expand the market, Americans are more concerned about permanent markets. The UK's gaze is the same, she is paying attention to the following places...

Soviet Union: This is one of the largest markets in the world, with 200 million people, and needs a lot of machinery, electrical appliances and consumer goods.

China: This is another big market, with 450 million people. If long-term loan facilities can be provided, it will need a lot of machinery, railway equipment and consumer goods.

India: With 389 million people, they can buy all kinds of manufactured goods if they have sufficient purchasing power.

Near East: In addition to Egypt and Turkey, there are Iraq, Iran, Palestine, etc., which are all very rich markets and should not be ignored.

Latin America: This is the most valuable market. They have cultivated a very strong purchasing power during the war. They need transportation tools, agricultural tools, and electrical appliances. Americans have already penetrated Mexico, Cuba, Colombia, etc. The UK has Argentina and Uruguay in the gold pound group. Brazil, Peru, and Chile are also big buyers, as long as the price is cheap.

The UK has a superior advantage in participating in this market competition. Her machines and trained technology are superior to the UK's, and raw materials are very abundant. The number of ships is also three times that of the UK, and she has strong financial resources to implement long-term loans.

But the Americans are not willing to just stay in their own advantages. They have already organized a research committee to study the sales problem in the United States, and another group is conducting a survey in the Middle East, and the United States' huge advertising budget—250 million yuan—will be deployed in South America, Turkey, Egypt and China.

If advertising alone can determine the outcome, the United States can win. But the British also have their confidence, and this confidence advertisement is based on several realistic situations. First, the British, under the leadership of Prime Minister Attlee, have the same confidence as in the Churchill era. Second, the United States still needs British goods. In the past, one-third of the United States' exports were shipped to the UK, and one-quarter of the imports were shipped from the UK. At present, the United States still hopes to maintain this good relationship, because the commercial competition between the United States and the UK is certainly very fierce, but it also hopes that the UK will not be in a dead end, and hopes that they can help each other.

### Definite Goals

— Fei Wen

A person who does management work must have definite goals. Before he deliberates and implements various matters, he must act according to these goals.

In the past, the manager of the office of a wholesaler in the United States discovered that there were too many types of printed materials used in his recording department. Too many types of printed materials not only increased printing costs, but also required more manpower to use those too many printed materials, so the costs also increased. To solve this difficulty, it is necessary to use a basic principle, that is, to consider whether each type of printed material is absolutely necessary? If it is not absolutely necessary, then it can be eliminated or the two can be combined into one. In this way, the recording department of the wholesale merchant saved 3,000 yuan in expenses each year, and the other indirect expenses saved by other departments due to the simplification of procedures are not included.

A retail store had more and more inventory, but sales were not good. After a careful check, it turned out that the goods they were purchasing could not be sold quickly, so their funds were stuck and their turnover was not flexible. The solution after research was whether each type of goods could be sold immediately when it was purchased. After adopting this policy, the result was that not only was the variety of goods more organized, but also the flow of funds was smoother. This method is also a method of adopting basic principles to seek solutions.

### General Introduction to Mutual Commerce Management

— Xu Baiyi

Price and Cost Issues

The issue of goods prices and costs is very important to a business, so it is worthwhile for us to study it deeply. If a manager can know the reasons for price fluctuations and take the necessary coping measures, and at the same time accurately estimate his manufacturing costs, then he can manage his business well.

What is price? Price is the tool to measure value. For example, if we say that the price of a tent is five yuan and the price of a set of clothes is fifty yuan, then we can know that the price of a set of clothes is ten times that of a tent, and we can know the connection between the two.

Governments of various countries have regulations for the unit of currency. For example, in the United States, one yuan is equal to gold 23.22, but sometimes the price of goods will increase, which is the relationship of the depreciation of the currency system. For example, a certain commodity has always been five yuan per piece, but at present, it cannot be bought without fifty yuan. This is superficially the increase in the price of the commodity, but in fact it is the depreciation of the currency system.

When the value of the currency system is declining day by day, it is worthwhile for a manager to borrow money from various places and repay it on a regular basis. Because the currency system when he borrows money is even lower in value when he repays it. But whether the currency system continues to decline should be foreseeable in advance, so whether to continue borrowing money and continue purchasing goods is very important for an operator.

If a manager does not take into account possible changes in the market and moves forward blindly without looking back, when the market price falls, people will generally hold a wait-and-see attitude and stop buying, hoping to get a lower price. At this time, the sales of goods are stagnant and the flow of funds is stuck, which will form a state of slump, so the research on price aspects is very important.

In addition to the issue of the currency system, the situation in terms of needs can also affect prices. For example, a factory is willing to pay a higher price because it is afraid that it will not be able to purchase the required quantity, then the price will increase. If several places sell a kind of goods at the same time, and one of them is willing to sell at a lower price, then it will be enough to suppress the price of the goods.

What is market price? The explanation of the two words market price is the price at which a kind of goods is sold in the market. This market depends on the situation of various goods. The sales scope of many goods is limited to one place, and the sales scope of many goods can be expanded to the whole country or even the whole world. The prices in the markets in various places will vary because the supply and demand are different in various places. For example, the flour mill in the UK needs to buy the largest quantity of wheat, and the representative in Liverpool pays a higher price, so all places with wheat will be shocked by it, which may affect the wheat market all over the world, so the determination of the market price is based on the situation of needs and supply in various places.

The buyer who is willing to pay more mentioned above is easy to increase the number of suppliers, but the impact may also lead to overproduction.

Often when the price of a certain commodity increases due to the wider need in all aspects, after it can generate more profits, many people will engage in the production of this commodity and hope to obtain considerable profits. Even people who originally worked in a factory will set up their own factories to engage in manufacturing. This situation will result in overproduction. At that time, in order to enable the goods to continue to sell, they have to reduce the price for dumping, so only larger-scale factories can continue to maintain, and smaller-scale organizations with insufficient strength will be eliminated.

The cost of sales is included in the cost of the goods: The general understanding is that the cost of a kind of goods only includes its manufacturing cost. In fact, from an economic standpoint, the cost of sales should also be included in the cost of the goods. Moreover, as has been said above, a kind of goods with excellent quality is easily accepted by the public, so the cost of sales required can also be saved. All goods with lower sales costs can indirectly affect their costs. That is, their cost is also relatively low, so in a business, although the sales of goods are responsible by the sales department, they should also try their best to reduce costs. Otherwise, if the actual manufacturing cost of the mouth product is indeed low, but the cost of sales is very high, or it takes a lot of advertising expenses to make the goods sell, then the result will not be able to obtain substantial profits.
