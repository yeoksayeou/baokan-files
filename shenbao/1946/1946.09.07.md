### Marshall and Stuart Express Their Views: Agreement Must Be Sought to Reorganize the National Government Committee; Zhou Enlai Has Telegraphed Yan'an for Instructions

[Reuters, Nanjing, 6th] It is learned that in order to make a final effort to break the deadlock, Marshall and Stuart have assured the Communist Party that if the Communist Party agrees to participate in the five-person group meeting, they will do their best to ensure that the government guarantees that a ceasefire order will be issued after an understanding is reached on the establishment of a reorganized National Government Committee. Marshall is trying to find out to what extent Chairman Chiang is prepared to accept the conditions of the Communist Party. It is thought that Chairman Chiang's conditions are to draw a line north of the Yangtze River to prevent the Communist Party from expanding its political, military, and land control beyond that line. Zhou Enlai has telegraphed Yan'an for instructions. Also, after meeting with Marshall on the 6th, Zhou went to the headquarters of the Democratic League to visit Liang Shuming and report on the development of the situation.

[United Press, Nanjing, 6th] Special Envoy Marshall hurried to Guling to convey the attitude of the CCP to Chairman Chiang in the hope that the Chairman would clearly state the government's attitude towards a national ceasefire. Marshall, Stuart, and Zhou held a meeting for an hour and a half on the 6th. Zhou listened to the American side's views and telegraphed the CCP Politburo in Yan'an to consider the situation. The American side emphasized that at least an agreement must be sought on the establishment of a National Government Committee composed of various parties and factions. Zhou also stated that unless Chairman Chiang declares at what stage of the five-person group discussion a ceasefire order can be issued, the CCP is afraid that it will be unwilling to participate in any political discussions. There are now three ways forward: (1) Yan'an approves the American proposal for action in the coming weeks, so that Stuart can immediately convene a five-person group meeting; (2) Otherwise, Chairman Chiang can make a clear guarantee to the CCP through Marshall that a ceasefire order will be issued to meet Yan'an's requirements; (3) If the attempt by Marshall to climb Lushan and the Zhou Enlai telegram to Yan'an to consider the two options still fail, then the situation will remain in the current stalemate.

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 6th] Regarding the issue of suppressing bandits in Taihu Lake, no concrete action has been seen since the closing of the Jiangnan Security Conference. After synthesizing information from various sources, a reporter learned that the highest military authorities have decided on a strategy of suppression, which has been submitted to Chairman Chiang by Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Army Tang Enbo for approval and implementation. A Taihu Lake Water Area Bandit Suppression Headquarters will soon be organized, with Lieutenant General Chen Daqing, Deputy Commander of the First Pacification Area, serving as commander. The location has been selected in Wuxi. The headquarters is authorized by the Ministry of National Defense to uniformly command the armies and local forces of various counties in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and to train a rapid water force.

### The Ministry of Social Affairs Emphasizes Law and Discipline

Re-instructing Local Organizations to Abide by Laws and Regulations

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] The Ministry of Social Affairs notes that recently, a small number of local organizations, either driven by righteous indignation or seeking solutions too hastily, have immediately taken action based on their proposals, inevitably deviating from standard procedures and failing to fully comply with legal norms. This is contrary to the government's commitment to respecting democracy and seeking the rule of law. Therefore, it is re-issuing a circular to social administrative agencies in all provinces and cities, instructing them to direct relevant authorities to report or denounce to the competent authorities or courts, in accordance with the law, any local social organizations or members thereof deemed to be involved in treachery or to be endangering local security, pending a ruling, to ensure compliance with laws and discipline.

### Aigleton Tells Reporters He Is Willing to Do His Best to Serve Us; UNRRA Work Review Meeting Held in Seven Groups Yesterday

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 6th] The newly appointed Director of the UNRRA China Office, Major General Aigleton, and Mr. Lei, the acting director who is about to return to the United States, held a press conference on the morning of the 6th. Aigleton expressed satisfaction with UNRRA's work and stated that he would do his best to ensure the shipment of supplies to China. He also mentioned that, during his time in Shanghai, he visited the docks and found that the situation there was not as "poor as imagined," as efforts were being made to transport the goods out after they arrived at the port. Aigleton spent most of the time discussing two issues: the shipment of UNRRA supplies to China and the supply of materials to Communist-held areas. Regarding the former, Aigleton believed that the embargo had little impact on China, as not all supplies were stopped after the embargo was issued, and he hinted that the embargo might be lifted. The key to this matter lies in transportation conditions. It is claimed that some of the suspended supplies are bulky equipment and some are due to transportation difficulties. Those that can be distributed immediately after receipt will continue to be shipped. Regarding whether the UNRRA relief program will be extended to the end of June next year, Aigleton believes that China's transportation is slow, and it may be difficult to complete the program before March next year, so an extension is possible. Foreign reporters were extremely concerned about the shipment of supplies to Communist-held areas. Aigleton stated that supplies to Communist areas are being shipped according to the original plan, and the distribution of relief supplies is not subject to political restrictions, but depends entirely on the needs of each region, with transportation being the main factor. However, there are also practical difficulties, and some supplies are too dangerous to be delivered. UNRRA personnel also announced two things at the press conference: one is that UNRRA has borrowed 8 million yuan from the Central Bank, and UNRRA has not subsidized its expenses; the other is that UNRRA is negotiating with the Executive Yuan to purchase some of the surplus supplies of the US military for relief purposes, which would save transportation tonnage and be beneficial to both parties.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 6th] The UNRRA work review meeting was held in seven groups in the morning and afternoon of the 6th to discuss relief work, agricultural rehabilitation, industrial and mining rehabilitation, health facilities, distribution of materials, transportation, procurement, sales, utilization of foreign experts, and business connections between sub-bureaus. The third general meeting will be held on the morning of the 7th.

### Chennault and UNRRA to Sign Contract in Shanghai

Air Transport of Relief Supplies in Accordance with the Law

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 6th] Regarding the matter of General Chennault signing a contract with UNRRA to transport relief supplies by air, the UNRRA spokesman here has confirmed this, but believes that the rumor that the contract is expected to be signed on the 7th is premature. UNRRA Director-General Chiang has been busy attending meetings these days, so even if Chennault comes to Nanjing from Shanghai, it will be difficult to sign this rather complicated contract on the 7th. In his observation, it is more likely that the contract will be signed in Shanghai. According to the contract, UNRRA will allocate equipment worth 3 million US dollars to Chennault. It is said that the organization Chennault has formed is a private company, which will initially have twelve aircraft operating. In addition to transporting UNRRA relief supplies, it may also transport some commercial goods. It is heard that the company's aircraft operating in our territory must obtain the approval of our government and must not violate international aviation regulations. The rumor that our national airspace will be undermined as a result is absolutely untrue.

### Total Number of UNRRA Ships Arriving in China Reaches 300

[US Information Service, Shanghai, 5th] UNRRA announced today that, since November of last year, the number of UNRRA ships that have unloaded goods in the ports of Shanghai, Hong Kong, Qinhuangdao, Qingdao, Xiamen, and Hankou has reached 300, unloading a total of 980,586 long tons of goods. A total of 53 ships are already on their way to China, carrying approximately 150,790 long tons of UNRRA goods.

### The Democratic Socialist Party Receives Reporters and Expresses Its Attitude Towards the Current Situation: Supporting Peaceful Unification and Engaging in Construction

[Report from Our Newspaper] The China Democratic Socialist Party, formed by the merger of the National Socialist Party and the Overseas Democratic Constitutional Government Party, hosted reporters at the International Hotel yesterday. Over sixty people attended, including the party's leaders Zhang Junmai, Xu Fulin, Sun Baoyi, Jiang Yuntian, and reporters from various newspapers. Zhang Junmai began by reporting, stating briefly that he did not want to talk too much about the dangers of the current situation, but rather to make more efforts in practice. Like a house, he did not want to be a beautiful and eye-catching glass window, but would rather be a silently contributing foundation of three-in-one soil. Zhang then introduced Xu Fulin, who had traveled far to Nanyang due to party affairs, and invited him to express the party's views on the current situation. Xu stated that the Democratic Socialist Party will hold its founding congress in three months. After its establishment, its aspirations for national affairs are as follows: (1) China urgently needs peace now. The party advocates immediately stopping internal conflicts, laying a foundation for the rule of law, and engaging in construction. (2) Support unification. The military should belong to the state, not to any particular party or faction. In this way, the military will not be used as a tool for political disputes, and true national unification can be realized. (3) Demand democracy. Sovereignty should belong to all the people. True democracy is not the democracy of one party or one class. One should not use democracy as a slogan just because a certain party possesses the military. The people should be given sound knowledge through education, live in peace and work happily, and have ample food and clothing, and then participate in elections and freely choose the political party they support. (4) Realize a socialist political system. The party demands democracy in politics and advocates the implementation of socialism in economics, hence the name Democratic Socialist Party.

Then, Sun Baoyi expressed the party's four-point attitude towards the current situation: (1) Regarding the proposal to reorganize the government and establish a coalition government, it arose during the period of division between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Later, the resolutions established by the Political Consultative Conference aimed to unite the entire country. The party's aim since the War of Resistance is to support any government that is beneficial to unity. (2) Regarding the National Assembly, the party believes that whether the country is unified depends on whether the constitution is unified. The party is willing to support a unified constitution to promote a unified country. (3) Regarding the military reorganization plan, the party believes that whether the country is unified depends on whether the national defense forces are unified or divided. In the military reorganization plan, the ratio of the number of troops of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is one to five, which has been acknowledged by both sides. In the future, they should only discuss the location of troops and the method of mobilizing troops, and there is no need to argue about the gains and losses of one district or one place. (4) Peaceful unification is above all else. Chairman Chiang led the War of Resistance and national construction, and the party is very willing to support him, but hopes that the government will prioritize peaceful unification.

### Commander of the Enemy Xuzhou Kempeitai Sentenced to Death

[Our Xuzhou Correspondent] Japanese war criminal Zen Eiyo, formerly the Commander of the Hankou Kempeitai, was promoted to Commander of the Xuzhou Japanese Kempeitai in 1943. During his tenure, he and the head of the military affairs section, Nakaya Gishun, killed countless of our compatriots and resistance fighters. He also arrested Chen Jianxun, the Director of the Lixi Hutian Taxation Bureau in Western Shandong, and Huang Junjie, the section chief. Huang eventually died from torture. After the victory, he was captured by the Military Tribunal of the Pacification Headquarters and prosecuted. The trial has now concluded, and Zen Eiyo and Nakaya Gishun have been sentenced to death for joint murder and deprived of their civil rights for life. They will be executed after being approved by the Ministry of National Defense.

### Overseas Chinese Unemployed in Italy Repatriated by Overseas Chinese Association

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 6th] A group of unemployed overseas Chinese from Qingtian, Italy, have been gathered by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission in the ports of Genoa and Naples and will be transported back to China on the "Maria Lo Run" ship, which previously transported German overseas Chinese from Shanghai.

### Remittance Quotas for Overseas Chinese in British Territories Too Low

Hoping the Government Will Negotiate with the British to Relax Restrictions

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 6th] Overseas Chinese are suffering greatly from the problem of overseas remittances. In British territories, each person can only remit 5 British pounds per month. In Singapore, the monthly remittance amount is 45 Straits dollars, which is only equivalent to 60,000 national currency. This amount is not enough to support the livelihoods of their families in the country. Overseas Chinese are eagerly hoping that the government will quickly negotiate with the British to seek reasonable adjustments.

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 4th] Siam has relaxed its foreign exchange control measures. Chinese residents can now remit money back home for household expenses. The regulations stipulate that monthly remittances should not exceed 50 Siamese baht, which is approximately 12,500 national currency.

### Philippine Military Police Indiscriminately Arresting Overseas Chinese; Raiding Our Newspaper and Schools; Philippine Authorities Claim They Will Investigate

[Associated Press, Manila, 6th] The Philippine Military Police today continued to arrest large numbers of overseas Chinese and raided the Chinese Commercial News, sponsored by the Chinese Labor Union, and the primary school run by the Chinese YWCA. Eighteen employees of the Chinese Commercial News, including the publisher Guo Jimeng (transliteration), have been detained by the Philippine Military Police for questioning. Two primary school teachers and at least six labor union employees have also been arrested. Philippine President Roxas' Press Secretary, Farolan, announced that the matter would be investigated and stated that the Philippine government would issue a statement on the searches and arrests of overseas Chinese. According to the Guangfeng News, the searches and arrests were carried out on special orders from President Roxas. Philippine Interior Minister Quirante had solemnly announced a ban on the mass arrest of people without arrest warrants, or they would be subject to military law. Two hours after Quirante's order was issued, the Philippine Military Police arrested overseas Chinese. At the same time, President Roxas also ordered that no one be mistreated while detained, but today the Philippine Military Police actually struck people on the head with gun butts.

### Two Thousand Overseas Chinese from Batavia Arrive in Shanghai by Ship for Return

### US Surplus Supplies Given to China to Assist Our Economic Independence: Commentary from the Washington Star

[US Information Service, Washington, 5th] The Washington Star said in an editorial today that the agreement to transfer US non-military surplus property in the Pacific to China "has one basic objective: to assist all the people of China, regardless of their political affiliation, to restore their economic self-reliance, thereby gaining a better opportunity to complete their domestic unity and peace. Indeed, while such surplus property is not military equipment per se, some of it could be used to fight the Communists, but there is no such suspicion in the agreement with the National Government, for in fact it may take up to twenty-five months to complete the transfer of such property, and its distribution will be done as much as possible through China's normal commercial channels. In all respects, no matter what the Yenan Communists may say, this agreement seems quite sound, and the more reasonable assistance we give to China, the greater the help not only to China's interests, but also to the stability and peace of Asia and the world."

Zhu's face changed color upon hearing the sentence and expressed his determination to appeal.

Editorial

### People-to-People Diplomacy Between China and the United States

In this time, nearing the Mid-Autumn Festival yet with lingering heat and humidity, we observe the visit of a delegation of U.S. Congressmen to China, and the journey of Professor Pei Fei for travel and lectures. The former, though members of the U.S. government, are congressmen who originate from the populace; rather than being considered government officials, it would be more accurate to call them representatives of the people. They truly are representatives of the people, and they are visiting China in that capacity. As for Professor Pei Fei, he is a scholar who holds no government position and has returned to China purely in a private capacity. In the relationship between countries, such private or people-to-people interactions are of utmost importance. Only when mutual understanding between people increases can international understanding be promoted, and international cooperation enhanced. Therefore, we welcome the arrival of these people's representatives and hope that people-to-people contact can become more frequent, to dispel prejudices and misunderstandings, and to enhance international understanding.

Professor Pei Fei, in his scholarly manner, refrained from making definitive judgments on the current political situation. In the receptions held by the cultural and journalistic circles of this city and the National Diplomacy Association in recent days, Professor Pei Fei pointed out several times at the tea parties: We should not overestimate the impact of international relations on the domestic situation, and that the China problem is ultimately a domestic problem, and we must seek solutions and foundations within ourselves. We admire this objective viewpoint, and every patriotic citizen should adopt this attitude. To turn domestic problems into international problems, or to follow the dictates of foreign powers on domestic issues, goes against the most basic requirements of nationalism. However, so-called domestic problems also differ in nature and cannot be generalized. For example, the Northeast problem should have been a purely domestic problem, but from the beginning, it has been shrouded in international relations—wasn't the fate of the Northeast predetermined by the unpleasant Yalta Conference? U.S. congressmen, during their visit to China, declared in Beiping the other day: "The United States' attitude towards the Soviet Union should become more forceful. ...The failure of negotiations to resolve the Chinese dispute is mostly attributable to Soviet influence. ...The Soviet Union is attempting to control all of China and is already in the process of doing so. Once successful, we can prepare to withdraw completely from the East. Since the United States is concerned about world peace, it cannot condone this situation...." This thorough observation seems to present an interesting contrast to Professor Pei Fei's reserved attitude.

Here, we want to point out: First, China takes the Three Principles of the People as the supreme guiding principle for nation-building. Under nationalism, if it is a purely domestic problem, we insist that we must seek solutions through our own efforts. Second, China suffered the most significant sacrifices and endured the longest period of hardship in World War II. We know how terrible war is; therefore, we have the greatest expectations for the establishment of lasting world peace. We are by no means a warlike nation, so we are extremely reluctant to see the outbreak of a third world war, which would subject mankind to even greater disaster. Having stated these two premises, we feel that as the Chinese situation has developed to its current stage, we are indeed ashamed of our lack of ability and insufficient effort. However, there has also been no shortage of situations where international relations have fueled the flames. The fundamental reason lies in the fact that the Communist Party is an international party. The central figures are Communists who have no difference in ideology or methods from Communists appearing elsewhere. They call themselves "democratic" and use the democratic traditions of democratic countries to enhance their position. The arrogance of the Chinese Communists today is partly due to the lack of understanding of the Chinese national conditions by people in advanced democratic countries. Therefore, the Chinese situation has always had some international relations involved from the beginning. After the CCP's position strengthened, they began to reveal their true colors. The CCP's anti-American propaganda and Moscow's anti-American rhetoric echo each other, as if prearranged. This is certainly not an accidental event.

From the perspective of the Chinese people, we dare to say that any method of indirectly supporting the Communist Party within China is not what the Chinese nation needs. The Chinese people need to live and work in peace and unity, but the CCP is expanding its military and launching wars everywhere, and its leaders openly declare plans for protracted warfare and attempts to form another government. Therefore, in the current situation, if we do not ask what the CCP's desires are, but simply adopt a policy of appeasement, we will inevitably continue the mistakes and failures of the past. We do not oppose "negotiations"; on the contrary, we would rather see the success of negotiations, but we must first ascertain whether the CCP has the sincerity to negotiate. For example, the incident of the Five-Man Group meeting these past few days, where the CCP went back on its word, is a prominent example that makes us unable to trust them. In this delicate international relationship, the wishes of the Chinese people are the same as those of the United States: they do not want another outbreak of a major war. To satisfy this wish, they should have a closer partnership. Some may hope to create a Chinese Tito, but the Chinese people are unwilling to sell out their country. We would like to ask authoritative writers like Professor Pei Fei: Since the Chinese problem is an internal problem of the Chinese people, is there anyone in the research-based countries still trying to support a Chinese Tito? This violates the wishes of the Chinese people, not to mention violating the principle of the Chinese people solving their internal problems themselves, and would also be a serious threat to world peace. What is needed at this time is for several major powers to have far-sighted and firm policies; and in the formation of these policies, there needs to be a mutual increase in understanding between peoples. In this sense, we welcome and hope for frequent contact between peoples; because only frequent contact between peoples can increase mutual understanding between peoples.

### Reflections on the Re-election of the Shanghai General Labor Union

Yesterday, the Shanghai General Labor Union held its fifth re-election of representatives. Hundreds of thousands of workers in Shanghai elected new leaders, no, new servants, from this conference. This is the first inspection of Shanghai's labor movement workers after the victory, and it can't be denied as a significant event in the history of the labor movement. First of all, we hope that these new leaders of the labor movement can properly lead the workers of Shanghai to a great road of hard work, national construction, improving workers' lives, and raising the status of labor. However, to lead the workers to this great road, we can't only rely on the labor union.

China doesn't need the communist theory of violent revolution, but China must implement the socialist theory of peaceful revolution; and this socialist theory of peaceful revolution, which has already been clarified in the teachings of the Founding Father, is the Principle of People's Livelihood. Therefore, the economic or social problems of China, are not the problems of whether or not we should implement the communist revolution through violence, but rather the problems of whether or not we are willing to practically promote the economic policies of the Principle of People's Livelihood. The responsibility of the Chinese Nationalist Party, the responsibility of the National Government, is extremely important and also extremely urgent today in its effort to implement the Principle of People's Livelihood. If we can determine the economic policies we should adopt under the major premise of implementing the Principle of People's Livelihood, then the government will have a direction to follow when solving the labor-capital disputes and all the labor problems that everyone is anxious about at present, and it will also be able to handle them with ease. The Labor Party government of the United Kingdom after the war, at least on this point, can be worthy of emulation by our government. However, we must know that there must first be a Labor Party like that of the United Kingdom, before there can be a Labor Party government like that of the United Kingdom, and there must first be a Labor Party like that of the United Kingdom, before all the labor unions in the United Kingdom can support the Labor Party government of that country; furthermore, there must first be a Labor Party leader like that of the United Kingdom, before it can mobilize the laborers throughout the country to support the Labor Party's implementation of its policies in various labor unions. Therefore, the labor movement should not be taken lightly, and it cannot be done casually. First, there must be a party that firmly believes in its ideology; second, there must be leaders with both talent and virtue; and third, there must be union members with both national consciousness and democratic literacy. Only when all three are in place can we hope for a healthy labor movement.

The Chinese Nationalist Party should take the responsibility without reservation for guiding Chinese workers to take on the responsibility of national production through self-reliance. We don't need to shy away from saying that there must be many members of the Nationalist Party who are active in many labor unions in Shanghai, and at the same time, there must also be some members of the Communist Party and even members of other parties who are active. In the middle of competing with each other, everyone naturally wants to win the sympathy and support of the workers. But precisely because of this, we must pay attention to two points: First, labor movement cadres must be among the masses, living with the workers and sharing their joys and sorrows. If one is only in a position to regard oneself as a leader of the workers, but in reality has already become detached from the laboring masses, then the labor movement will never have hope. In particular, one cannot treat labor movement activists who approach the laboring masses as "reactionaries" simply because they do not approach the masses themselves, avoiding them for fear of getting too close and rejecting them for fear of not being able to control them. Otherwise, it will run counter to the purpose of awakening the masses to fight together, and the result will inevitably be driving the birds into the abyss. Not long ago, the sudden takeover of the Chongqing branch of the Chinese Labor Association inevitably had this kind of adverse effect. If the Nationalist Party has a more long-term vision, it should be aware of this! Second, labor movement cadres must actually serve the masses and lead the masses on the right path. Only faithful service can earn sincere faith; and only proper leadership can avoid the danger of straying from the right path. Often there are some people who are very short-sighted and have a very shallow understanding, thinking that the labor movement is first and foremost about pleasing the workers. Therefore, without asking what the workers are asking for, they are unwilling to support reckless actions, thinking that this is the only way to win the masses. In fact, the legitimate demands of the workers should be consistent with the demands of the nation and the people. If we disregard the overall requirements of the nation and the people and only see the local interests of the workers, we will inevitably be led astray. Taking the opportunity of the re-election of the Shanghai General Labor Union, we briefly state our views on the labor movement, and we sincerely hope that the Nationalist Party and the leaders of the labor movement will pay attention to them!

### U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes Advocates the Establishment of a Provisional German Government to Direct National Affairs Under Allied Control, Opposes Any Dismemberment of German Territory, and Declares That U.S. Troops Will Not Withdraw Until Security is Guaranteed

[Report from this newspaper] London, 6th (Broadcast): Byrnes delivered a speech in Stuttgart today. The main points are as follows: (1) Urging the Allied countries to facilitate the establishment of a provisional central German government in Germany as soon as possible; (2) The United States does not want to see Germany become a vassal of any strong country or group, nor does it want to see the Germans eking out a living under the rule of dictators (foreign or domestic); (3) The U.S. side has no intention of withdrawing its occupying forces from Germany.

[Report from this newspaper] Paris, 6th (Broadcast): U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes delivered a speech to the German people today, claiming that the United States advocates the unification of Germany and criticizing the Allied countries for their procrastination. The main points of Byrnes's speech are as follows: (1) The Allied countries should immediately propose the terms of the peace treaty that Germany is required to abide by; (2) Define Germany's borders; (3) Eliminate all barriers between the four occupation zones; (4) Achieve complete economic unification in the country; (5) Criticize the Control Council's dilatory policies.

[United Press, New Stuttgart, Germany, 6th] U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes said in a speech here today, "The United States supports the early establishment of a German government in Germany, and the security occupying forces may have to stay in Germany for a long time. I do not want to be misunderstood. We will never shirk our responsibilities. We have not withdrawn, and if Germany needs occupying forces for a long time, the U.S. military will always be a part of the occupying forces." Byrnes delivered his speech to German and United Nations officials at the location of the temporary German government in this U.S. occupation zone. It is widely regarded as the most important foreign policy statement made by a U.S. politician after the war. To ensure security, the number of guards has been increased fourfold compared to usual.

Byrnes emphatically stated that the United States is determined to see Germany re-emerge as a peaceful country with group power. He rejected France's demands for the Rhineland and the Ruhr region, and warned Poland and the Soviet Union that the United States does not consider Germany's eastern border to be drawn along the Oder River. The land currently occupied by Poland and the Soviet Union is only "temporarily assigned" at Potsdam, and "the Potsdam Conference agreement stipulates that the heads of government will not support the cession of any special area when peacefully resolving issues." Byrnes urged the early establishment of a German central government, saying that the Four-Power Control Council is neither managing Germany nor allowing Germany to manage itself on many important issues. What the United Nations can and should do is to stipulate the rules that Germany can manage itself. The number of United Nations occupying forces should be limited, only sufficient to ensure that Germany obeys these rules. The U.S. government's opinion is that the provisional German government should not be selected by other countries' governments, but should be a German National Assembly, composed of democratically responsible officials from the provinces already established in the four occupation zones. The National Assembly, in addition to being subject to the reserved powers of the United Nations Control Council, should be responsible for promoting the proper work of the central administrative organs, and the central administrative organs should have full power to ensure that Germany becomes an economic unit, as stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement.

### Britain Expresses Warm Approval

[Report from this newspaper] Paris, 6th (Broadcast from London): Byrnes's speech in Stuttgart has been warmly approved by British officials, who share his view that the Polish administrative authorities in Germany are only a temporary government. They also agree with Byrnes's remarks on France. They said that the British government's goal is primarily to remove the economic difficulties in the British occupation zone, so that the people in the zone can be self-sufficient, because the current situation in the zone is creating a heavy burden for Britain.

### Economic Institutions in the British and American Occupation Zones of Germany to be Merged; A New Institution to be Established and Headed by Germans; Remarkable Achievements in the U.S. Occupation Zone

[United Press, Dublin, 5th] The authorities in the U.S. and British occupation zones announced today that they have jointly reached an agreement consisting of four points, stipulating that the basic economic institutions in the U.S. and British occupation zones will be merged and a new institution will be established and headed by Germans. At the same time, the standard of living in the two zones will be made the same, and the ration quantities will also be unified. In addition, the economic resources in the two zones will be used jointly, and the same import and export trade policies will be adopted. However, it is said that there is no intention to merge the two zones politically.

[United Press, Frankfurt, Germany, 5th] General McNarny, commander of the U.S. occupying forces in Germany, issued a statement today praising the German autonomous government in the U.S. occupation zone, saying that it is not an exaggeration to say that Germany can be expected to become a respected member of the international community again. However, this only refers to the German government institutions in the U.S. occupation zone, which are more advanced than those in any other occupation zone. On the other hand, the political progress of the entire Germany is equal to zero. McNarny's remarks came on the eve of Secretary of State Byrnes's sudden visit to the U.S. occupation zone. McNarny also said that Byrnes will carefully study and clarify U.S. policy toward Germany, but declined to comment on the relationship between his remarks and the speech that Byrnes intends to deliver. McNarny listed the situation of the U.S. occupying forces as follows:

"Disarmament" As far as the German army is concerned, this has been completed, and military equipment is being dismantled according to plan.

"Reparations" Slightly behind schedule due to the inability to unify the German economy and the failure to determine Germany's future borders.

"Re-education" Proceeding smoothly, the youth training program is the most important mission to democratize Germany.

"　　" Proceeding according to plan.

"The repatriation and resettlement of refugees" "Far behind" schedule. Currently, an average of 1,100 Jews are sneaking into the U.S. occupation zone from Poland every day, causing problems with food and lodging. France has agreed to accommodate 5,000 Jewish refugees, the Czech Republic may accommodate 10,000, Italy can also accommodate 10,000, and Belgium can accommodate 1-2,000. All these proposals are conditional on not allowing the refugees to reside permanently.

### Foreign Minister Wang Will Leave Paris and Return Home Tomorrow

[French News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] According to reliable sources, Wang Shijie, the head of the Chinese delegation to the Paris Peace Conference, will depart on the 8th and is expected to return to the capital on the 13th of this month. This trip is unrelated to the conclusion of the Paris Peace Conference, but is due to other important official duties that need to be handled in person. The United Nations General Assembly is scheduled to be held in New York on the 23rd of this month, and the Chinese side needs to make various decisions, which is one of the reasons for Wang's return home.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 5th (Special Dispatch)] This afternoon, our Foreign Minister Wang Shijie hosted a banquet for 12 senior French officials at our embassy in France, including French President and Foreign Minister Bidault and French Constitutional Assembly Speaker Herriot.

### He Yingqin Visits U.S. Naval Academy

[Central News Agency, Washington, 6th] The U.S. Navy Department said that General He Yingqin, accompanied by his naval adjutant, visited the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland today, and was warmly received by the school's president.

### Bevin Presides Over Plenary Session of Peace Conference Yesterday; Half the Seats in the Venue are Vacant; Cacophony of Noise in the Subcommittees; Heated Debate on the Issue of Trieste's Affiliation

[Report from this newspaper] Paris, 6th (Broadcast): The plenary session of the Peace Conference was held at 2 p.m. today, presided over by Bevin. Half of the seats in the venue were vacant, and there were many representatives' seats with only one person attending. After the meeting began, Iraqi Foreign Minister Jamali spoke first.

[United Press, Paris, 6th] Britain warned the Peace Conference today that if Trieste is not given a truly "international" free port status, Britain will withdraw from the Four-Power Agreement on the demarcation of the Venezia Giulia region. British representative McNeil said at the Peace Conference, first criticizing Yugoslavia's demand for a "special status" to manage Trieste, and then saying that if Trieste's independence is harmed, Britain will "reconsider the entire agreement." The British statement of this position is in response to the Slavic countries' demand for Yugoslavia to control Trieste.

[French News Agency, Paris, 5th] The Peace Conference's Committee on Italian Territory and Politics recently met to discuss the most difficult issue of Trieste's affiliation. The representatives of all countries are aware of the danger of this issue and are all very careful, like smoking cigarettes next to a powder keg, and a slight carelessness is enough to cause a terrible disaster. First, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky spoke, refuting the arguments put forward by the Italian Prime Minister and Associate Prime Minister one by one, and said that the residents of Trieste and the Venezia Giulia region total one million people, two-thirds of whom are Slavs, and only some cities are Italian, but this region must be regarded as a whole and cannot be divided. If the region is ceded to Italy, Italy will inevitably develop eastward. As for the suggestion to internationalize the region, the result will only cause dissatisfaction among the countries. The memorandum submitted by the Southern countries is the most worthy of our attention. The committee then adjourned and will continue to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow, when representatives from Poland, Britain, France, and Ukraine will all express their opinions on this issue.

### Greece and Albania Present Reasons for Demands for Reparations from Italy

[Reuters, Paris, 5th] The Italian Economic Committee met for 90 minutes tonight, causing a fierce dispute over whether to allow the Albanian representative to participate. Albania had formally applied previously, and Yugoslavia also supported it, but Greece opposed it. Soviet representative Arutyunyan vehemently opposed Greek interference, saying, "I sincerely do not understand why this simple etiquette question has been obstructed by Greece, and why it has fully vented its hatred and aggressive feelings toward that small country." The Soviet representative argued with the chairman for 50 minutes, and the chairman then proposed to put the matter to a vote, but the Soviet representative accused him of violating the law. For a time, only the sound of quarrels was heard, and other representatives also joined the debate, causing great disorder. At this point, the French representative explained the rules, that is, the Albanian representative may attend the committee to express his views and listen in on the debate, and the committee passed the case.

### Red-Faced Argument Over One Word; Military Committee Ends Unhappily

[French News Agency, Paris, 5th] At the meeting of the Peace Conference's Committee on Italian Military Affairs today, the representatives repeatedly debated the meaning of the word "goods" in the Treaty of Peace with Italy, and their faces turned red with anger. In the end, there was no definition. The Greek representative argued that "goods" meant "war materials," while the Ukrainian representative said that the compensation for Italy's seizure of war materials should be handled by the Reparations Committee. The British representative pointed out that "goods" included losses of property that could not be confirmed. Finally, it was decided to postpone the discussion.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 5th (Associated Press)] Today, British and Soviet representatives attacked each other fiercely at the Peace Conference's Military Committee. At that time, the chairman, Polish representative Moser, stood up and left the venue, saying, "If you continue to argue, I can only leave the venue." After three hours of fruitless debate, the meeting made no progress. Moser said that he did not see any signs of compromise, so he decided to announce the adjournment of the meeting.

[Report from this newspaper] Paris, 6th (Broadcast): The Balkan and Finnish Economic Committee continued to review Section 24 of Chapter 4 today, all of which are about Romania's reparations. The French delegation hopes that the Romanian delegation should be allowed to attend and express their opinions on the relevant issues.

### Ukraine Criticizes Britain and Greece; British Representative Forcefully Defends

[Reuters, New York, 5th] British representative Cadogan responded to Ukrainian Foreign Minister Manuilsky's accusations against Britain and Greece in the Security Council, saying that Manuilsky had failed to present evidence, and even if he did, the Security Council has no direct responsibility for ethnic minorities. Gromyko said that Britain used British troops to interfere in Greece's labor unions. I feel that no one wants to attach importance to this accusation. Foreign Minister Bevin had previously invited the Soviet Union to participate in the Four-Power Committee to investigate the situation in Greece, but the Soviet Union did not accept it. The British army has a glorious record in Greece. The British army sacrificed countless lives to defend Greece months before the Soviet Union or Ukraine was forced to participate in the war. That armed intervention did delay Hitler's attack on the Soviet Union by many months. Cadogan went on to say that the United Nations Charter does not prohibit a member state from stationing troops in another member state, even if invited by that other member state. I would like to ask what the Soviet army was doing in Iran not long ago. Cadogan then raised two points: First, the current situation in Greece is no worse than that of some other European countries that have not been investigated by the Security Council. Second, if the Communist Party did not exert pressure and propaganda in Greece, the situation in Greece would be better. Greece's only request is to be allowed to act on its own. The original intention of the United Nations was that if countries have disputes, they should first seek to resolve them themselves, and if there is no result, they should apply to the Security Council. If a member state suddenly makes accusations and makes insulting remarks at the Security Council without any reason, the dignity of the Security Council will be lost, and the purpose of the United Nations organization will be lost.

### Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to be Held in Mid-October

[TASS, Moscow, September 5th] The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union has decided to postpone the second session of the Supreme Soviet from September 20th to October 15th.

### Four Foreign Ministers Convene Special Meeting: US Represented by Dunn to Discuss UN General Assembly Summoning

[Our Own Dispatch] Paris, 6th (Radio Broadcast): Due to the insistence of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, Bidault suddenly convened a special meeting of the four major powers' foreign ministers at 4:00 PM today. The meeting will primarily focus on whether to postpone the UN General Assembly or convene it as scheduled in New York on September 23rd.

### Crossing the English Channel to Paris (Part 1): The Aroma of Coffee Thickens in the Capital of Art

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Xueyan

[Airmail from Paris, August 16th] It takes a total of nine and a half hours to travel from London to Paris by train, but a full four hours are spent crossing the sea, and the actual train journey is only five and a half hours. The English Channel is quite narrow between Dover and Calais, only about thirty miles. Digging a tunnel would not be difficult, and many people have suggested it, but such a convenient construction for travelers contains national defense risks. If the isolated three islands of Britain had such a shortcut connecting to the mainland, it would inevitably threaten the security of this island nation in the event of an emergency. Therefore, Britain would rather let those crossing the sea complain than lightly take this risk. The reporter must

go to Paris for business.

I left London by train at 9:20 AM and arrived in Dover at 11:00 AM to enter and exit the country. As usual, there was a set of procedures. More than two hundred people on the same train lined up to wait for passport and luggage inspections. The British are careful but not fussy, slow but very thorough. This is what the reporter has repeatedly realized since arriving in Britain, and this trip is another confirmation. If there are any outstanding advantages in the British national character, this should be the most important characteristic. The inspection procedures for more than two hundred people were completed within an hour and a half, and the ferry sailed around 11:30 AM. The English Channel is known for its wind and waves, so although the sea crossing only takes an hour and a half, most travelers regard it as a long journey. Few people who are not used to sailing can avoid seasickness and vomiting and pass safely. On the day the reporter crossed the sea, although the weather was clear and the wind was calm, the ship began to shake up and down as soon as it started, and I immediately felt dizzy and nauseous, feeling a little overwhelmed. But the British are indeed fond of sports and

a seafaring nation.

Despite the ship swaying and many passengers gradually turning pale, many were still unaffected. They not only did not find it difficult, but seemed to enjoy it. Young men and women rushed to the ship's rails to watch the waves move and see if anyone among their companions felt strange, taking it as a source of amusement. After enduring this hour and a half, we arrived in Calais, which is in France. At first glance, the most obvious impression for travelers is that the war damage is severe, and the wealth of the French people is far less than that of the British. Although London has also suffered from German bombing, and ruins can be seen everywhere in Britain, it is not as severe as in Calais, where entire areas within a few miles have been leveled. After the train left the station, for a long time, I still couldn't see complete houses, only damaged iron and steel lying on piles of tiles and rubble, which was unsettling to see.

On the French docks

The laborers who greet passengers, although generally clean and tidy, all wearing blue uniforms, are inevitably mixed with ragged people, unlike in Britain, where everyone is neatly dressed, and even beggars do not have obvious signs of poverty on the surface. And the number of workers is also far greater than at British docks, which also illustrates that Britain is richer than France. The British have few people and many jobs. Although there are also unemployed people, strictly speaking, they are not really without anything to do, but many British are unwilling to do jobs with low pay and difficult tasks, preferring to sit and wait for opportunities. It is said that many miners in Britain are Italians and Poles, because the British themselves are unwilling to work as miners, so in any situation, there is never a surplus of labor. The French docks cannot maintain this standard, so there is inevitably competition for business. Even if you are carrying a very small piece of luggage, there will always be several people

rushing up to offer their services

. On Chinese docks, there are always dozens of laborers for one passenger, swarming up like flies chasing carrion, desperately competing, as if they want to swallow the passenger in one gulp, which is naturally another matter. This is a characteristic of the intense competition for survival among Easterners. In addition, in terms of soliciting rewards, French laborers are far less elegant and generous than the British. They walk along carrying your suitcase, constantly asking you for a price: one shilling! Two shillings! Or thirty or fifty francs! They all compete fiercely! Conversely, British laborers mostly let you decide the price. If you are not excessive, they will never bargain with you. In fact, the people who pay the money are not stingy because of this. The British reputation for gentlemanly demeanor can indeed be confirmed in such subtle places, but the difference in wealth between the two countries is probably a more important practical reason.

### Unrest Continues in India: Deaths and Injuries Reach Thousands in Recent Days; Nehru to Broadcast Policy Explanation Today

[Our Own Dispatch] London, 6th (Radio Broadcast): The unrest in Mumbai and other places in India has intensified today, with deaths and injuries reaching one thousand, including 203 deaths, and more than two thousand arrests.

[United Press Mumbai, 5th] The Hindu-Muslim conflict did not ease today. A curfew was reimposed in most parts of Mumbai this evening. Since the 6th, at least two hundred people have been killed and six hundred injured. Sporadic bayonet attacks have claimed ten victims. At the same time, the police authorities conducted a large-scale search for troublemakers, and two thousand suspects have been arrested. After a bus driver and conductor were stabbed, the city's traffic was completely paralyzed, and most shops were closed. The government announced that if necessary, Mumbai would implement a continuous 24-hour prohibition order.

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 5th] It is claimed that Indian Prime Minister Nehru will deliver a speech on the 7th of this month to explain the policies adopted by the interim government. It will be broadcast from Delhi Radio, once in Hindi at 8:30 PM and once in English at 8:45 PM. This is Nehru's first broadcast speech on Indian radio. At the same time, according to well-informed sources, the first reform to be undertaken by the interim government will be the abolition of the salt tax. This tax is considered by most Indians as a symbol of foreign rule. In fact, it is also a type of old tax, which was implemented by the Maurya Dynasty three hundred years before the Common Era, and was subsequently retained by Muslims and the British. The abolition of this tax will save each Indian one rupee per year.

### Greek Regent Resigns: Republican Democrats Recognize the Monarch

[United Press Athens, 5th] Greek Regent Damaskinos submitted his resignation today after the results of the referendum were announced. It will be approved once King George II returns to the country.

[Reuters Athens, 5th] Former Prime Minister Panayiotis Kanellopoulos said today that his Republican Social Democratic Party will unconditionally recognize the monarch. The National Unity Party of Kanellopoulos has also made the same statement. Currently, the EAM Party, the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the People's Republican Party have not yet recognized the monarch.

### Where Do Rockets Come from in Greek Airspace?

[Agence France-Presse, London, 5th] Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris came here to welcome King George back to the country. According to reports, mysterious rockets have been discovered in Greek airspace in the past few days. One was discovered over Thessaloniki Province, and several were discovered over Bacchus Province. It is reported that rockets have been seen frequently in Sweden and Norway in recent months, which are said to be launched from the Soviet-occupied zone in Germany.

### Anglo-Egyptian Negotiations Stalled: The Crux of the Matter is the Sudan Issue

[Our Own Dispatch] Paris, 6th (Radio Broadcast, Cairo): The "Al-Ahram" newspaper here commented: The Sudan issue is the main reason for the Anglo-Egyptian negotiations to stall, so we should pay special attention to the statement of Egyptian Prime Minister Sidky Pasha. Sidky Pasha said: The Egyptian delegation requested that Sudan be placed under the same rule as the Egyptian king. The British side need not fear this. We only ask to unite Egypt and Sudan, and there is no other desire for Sudan. The claim that the Sudanese people reject this alliance is completely inaccurate. After the Egyptian Prime Minister issued the above statement, he met with Azhari, the head of the Sudanese delegation. Although the Sudanese representatives do not have the right to participate in the negotiations, they have always maintained close contact with the Egyptian government.

### US Lease of Australian Bases Continues in Negotiations; Australian Prime Minister Says Bases Should be Provided to Britain

[United Press Brisbane, Australia, 5th] Prime Minister Chifley told reporters tonight: Australia wants all important bases in the Pacific, no matter where they are, to be available to Britain, New Zealand, and Australia at all times. Negotiations continue on the issue of the United States leasing Manus Island and other Pacific island bases in Australia. It is extremely important for Pacific bases to be available to Britain, because the British mainland is vulnerable to destruction by modern weapons, so its future economic and defense strength must largely rely on the dominions.

### Palestine Issue: US Policy Remains Unchanged; London Conference Postponed to the 10th

[Our Own Dispatch] Paris, 6th (Radio Broadcast, London): The official opening date of the London Palestine Conference will be delayed by one day. Prime Minister Attlee's opening address on September 9th will also be changed to the 10th. Monday will be entirely spent on establishing contact between the representatives of the British government and the Arab representatives. The Jewish representatives will also likely decide to attend the conference.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 5th] President Truman recently received reporters and made a statement saying that he will continue to strive to allow 100,000 Jews to immigrate to Palestine. Representatives of the United States and Britain are currently negotiating in London to discuss this matter. As for the plan drafted by Grady and Morrison (advocating lending 300 million US dollars to the Arabs in exchange for the free immigration of Jews to Palestine), it is currently under review.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 5th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin is scheduled to return to London from Paris tomorrow afternoon or the day after tomorrow to study all documents related to the Palestine issue before the opening of the Palestine Conference.

[Reuters Cairo, 5th] Representatives of the Arab states have departed for London to attend the Palestine Conference. Azzam Pasha, the Secretary-General of the Arab League, has decided to attend in person. Alami, the former Secretary of the Palestinian Arab Party, has rejected the invitation from the British government and does not want to attend the London Conference.

### Humans Can Survive at Altitudes of Over 30,000 Feet Without Oxygen: Germans Used Jews for Experiments

[Central News Agency, Washington, 4th (United Press)] The US Army Air Force has discovered a Nazi secret medical report. As a result of Nazi scientists conducting experiments on humans, it has been discovered that humans can survive at altitudes of 30,400 feet without oxygen. The test subjects were Jews or criminals. All the test subjects survived in the 30,400 feet of pressure of the experiment. Without oxygen, they would die if the pressure exceeded 33,600 feet. The report stated that in one experiment, Jews could maintain life for half an hour at 38,400 feet. These Jews died after the experiment, but their hearts continued to beat.

### Using Rocket Spaceships to Travel Between Planets: US Military is Studying

[Our Own Dispatch] San Francisco, 6th (Radio Broadcast): Engineers at the US Army Air Force arsenal announced that they are studying new weapons that are more effective than the atomic bomb, because the atomic bomb may be considered illegal internationally. These engineers are studying weapons that are not subject to this restriction.

[United Press Pasadena, 6th] It was revealed here that in mid-November, the US Institute of Technology will test the possibility of using rocket spaceships for interstellar travel in White Sands, New Mexico. Professor Zwicky of the Institute will be responsible for this work.

### Documents on the Pearl Harbor Attack: Japanese Government Should Submit for Review Immediately; MacArthur Orders Compliance by the 9th

[United Press Tokyo, 6th] MacArthur's headquarters instructed the Japanese government on the 4th to submit all plans and orders for the attack on Pearl Harbor, as well as all letters and telegrams from the Japanese Navy or Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Japanese consul in Honolulu regarding the location of US fleet anchorages in Hawaiian waters and all movements, to the International Prosecution Section of the headquarters by the 9th of this month.

### LaGuardia Calls for the Establishment of a World Food Commission

[United Press Danzig, 5th] UNRRA Director LaGuardia called here today for immediate action to establish a World Food Commission. Although the representatives of the countries agreed with Lai's speech, they were unwilling to express their views on Lai's so-called cancellation of the exchange. This plan may not be directly submitted to the meeting, but may be studied by a group designated by the Food and Agriculture Organization to consider the issue of organizing the World Food Commission. Lai should also invite the Soviet Union to join the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.

[Reuters London, 5th] LaGuardia arrived here today from Copenhagen and took a plane back to New York this evening. Before leaving, he visited British Prime Minister Attlee.

### US Maritime Workers' Strike Surges: Shipowners Request Presidential Intervention

[United Press New York, 5th] Approximately 100,000 seafarers belonging to the American Federation of Labor were ordered to strike at all ports starting at noon today. In San Francisco, strike pickets immediately went to guard the docks, and other docks will also be guarded before 7:00 AM tomorrow morning. This strike was caused by the Wage Stabilization Board's reduction of the wage increase. At the same time, other seafarers and dockworkers, including seafarers belonging to the Congress of Industrial Organizations, an enemy of the Labor Federation, may eventually join the strike. Shipowners are demanding that President Truman take action.

### Increased Housing Rent to Begin in Autumn? Finance Bureau Plans New Methods to be Submitted to the Senate

[Our Own Dispatch] A person in charge of the Finance Bureau said: The bureau is submitting new methods to the Municipal Senate for increasing the housing rent, that is, regardless of whether the rent is increased, the housing rent will be increased separately. According to the central laws and regulations, in principle, the housing rent is slightly collected based on the rent, but regardless of the rent, the Finance Bureau can determine the standard for collecting the housing rent. The current irrationality of this city is well known. As such, there is no reason for the housing rent to follow the rent again. Therefore, it is planned to implement new methods starting in the autumn, increasing from 14% to 20%. The collection will still maintain the grading system of one-fold for Grade A, two-fold for Grade B, and three-fold for Grade C, with progressive increases. For those in Grade A, the assessment will be tripled compared to the summer. After this method is implemented, the housing rent may be higher than the current rent, but the Finance Bureau believes that sound finances for the city must have reliable sources of revenue. And increasing the housing rent is the most appropriate method, for three reasons: (1) Housing rent is a direct tax and cannot be transferred or evaded, so it is the fairest. (2) The tax revenue is fixed. (3) The collection procedure is simple. If this proposal can be passed, then the housing rent in this city can be separated from the rent in the future, and the city's finances can also be stabilized. However, it is reported that the Finance Bureau's informal exchange of views with a few municipal senators has not resulted in their agreement to the proposal, but the Finance Bureau believes that this is the most basic method of opening up new sources of revenue and will definitely strive for it.

### Embezzlement Case: Accomplices Apprehended; Freight Escort of Jinpu Railway Sells Goods in Nanjing for More Than Ten Million; Four Criminals Flee North

[Our Own Dispatch] Details of the case of Feng Zhenbang, a freight escort on the Jinpu Railway, stealing twelve pieces of cotton cloth were reported in yesterday's newspaper. The Jinpu Railway authorities, concerned about their responsibility, specially sent inspectors Sun Shuren and Li Guanghui to Shanghai to jointly investigate with the police departments of the two railways. The day before yesterday, late at night, accomplice Ma Yunqi (see photo) was arrested, and Ma confessed the details of the theft as follows:

The main culprits, Feng Zhenbang and Lei Guangrui (Feng is a freight escort, Lei is a staff member of the Xuzhou Luggage Room), were both former employees of the puppet "Hua Tie," and Ma introduced them both to "Hua Tie" at the time, so the relationship between the three was very close. In this theft plan, Feng had already discussed it with Chen Baichuan at Xuzhou Station when shipping the goods, and Lei Guangrui waited at Nanjing Station three days in advance. When Feng's car arrived in Nanjing, Lei used a forged "self-handled parcel ticket" to impersonate the owner and picked up twelve pieces of cotton cloth from the Nanjing Luggage Room. After Lei picked up the goods, he hired a horse-drawn carriage to transport them to the home of a friend named Tong. Feng then still escorted the remaining goods to Shanghai for delivery, claiming at the North Station that the remaining twelve pieces were being loaded and signed the "Delivery Certificate," so he fooled them at the time. After Feng delivered the goods, he hurriedly returned to Beijing and discussed the method of selling the stolen goods with Lei and Ma Yunqi in a room at the Dahua Hotel on Henan Road. He also invited Feng's classmates, the Yang Zaihuan and Yang Zaiyan brothers, to participate. It was decided to sell the stolen goods in three batches, totaling 12 million yuan (original value 30 million yuan). Ma knew that the first batch was sold to Nanjing Hongxing Cloth Store for more than 4 million yuan. The remaining two batches are still under investigation. Ma received 1 million yuan in stolen money.

After distributing the loot

Feng, Lei, Yang Zaihuan, Yang Zaiyan, and Ma Yunqi came to Shanghai together and rented rooms 14 and 16 at the Tongle Inn on Caishi Road. On the one hand, they registered under aliases at the Northeast Refugee Reception Center on Penglai Road to return to their hometowns. Feng, Lei, and the Yang brothers took the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hai Chuan ship to Tianjin on the 2nd of this month. Ma remained in Shanghai because he had family members. Railway Bureau investigators believed that Feng and others were all from the Northeast and would definitely return to their hometowns after the incident, so they checked the refugee registration book at the Northeast Refugee Reception Center and found the names Feng Baozhen (Feng's alias) and Zhang Lie (Lei's alias). Both did not have photos, but the registered age and origin matched Feng and Lei. It was also learned that they claimed to have taken the entrance exam for Nanjing Central University but failed, so they were taking a detour back to their hometowns via Shanghai. The two Railway Bureau investigators, Sun and Li, felt that these two were suspicious. Based on the temporary addresses they filled out, they went to investigate with the Taishan Police Precinct and managed to capture Ma.

According to Ma's confession

he is 39 years old, and he used the 1 million yuan in stolen money he received to exchange for two gold bracelets at the Laotianbao Exchange in Beijing, one weighing one tael, five mace, and eight fen, and the other weighing one tael, four mace, and six fen, and a gold ring weighing three mace. After being interrogated by the Railway Bureau Police Department, Ma was escorted to Nanjing by Sun Shuren yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, accompanied by the owner of the goods, Chen Baichuan, to investigate the stolen goods. The four fugitives, Feng, Lei, and the Yang brothers, have been reported to Qingdao, Tianjin, and other places for arrest. The owner of the goods, Chen Baichuan, specially went to the North Station yesterday to express his gratitude to Station Master Tong. He was very grateful for the efforts of the police officers of the Jinpu authorities, who quickly solved the case.

### Public Utilities Bureau Convenes Car Dealers to Explain New Traffic Measures

Director Zhao Zengjue of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, in order to improve traffic in the central district and implement measures that will be implemented starting on September 9th, convened representatives of the tricycle dealers' association to the bureau for a discussion on the 5th to prepare in advance. Yesterday, he convened representatives of the rickshaw dealers' association for a discussion, and personnel from the police bureau also participated. Director Zhao explained the points stipulated in the implementation measures to the car dealers in detail and accepted the opinions of the representatives, supplementing two points: (1) The original measures stipulated that all empty tricycles and empty rickshaws were prohibited from entering the central district from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Those that have already entered the central district with passengers should stop at designated parking locations. However, since the parking locations have limited capacity, the following was added to item 7 of the driving restrictions, "Should stop at designated parking locations," "or leave the central district via the nearest road," so that each car can handle it in this way when the parking locations are full. (2) The income of tricycles is slightly higher than that of rickshaws, so the penalty in item (D) is that tricycles and rickshaws will be fined 1,000 yuan to 5,000 yuan for each violation of the regulations. Rickshaws can be fined less than tricycles to show the distinction, and the police bureau will pay attention to the implementation. The car dealers and worker representatives understood this quite well.

### Numerous Deaths of Prisoners of War: Haskins Testifies to Japanese Atrocities

[Our Own Dispatch] The US military court continued to hear the case yesterday morning against Colonel Matsuda, the former director of the Changchun Prisoner of War Camp, and Captain Kawashima, the medical officer, for mistreating American prisoners of war. Haskins described the situation in the camp, saying that in terms of food, each meal consisted of only five ounces of bread and a very small amount of vegetables. Meat was never seen, and the degree of crudeness was even worse than dog food. Due to insufficient nutrition, lack of drinking water, coupled with the encroachment of wind and rain and exposure to the scorching sun, prisoners of war died one after another in the absence of medical treatment. In addition to this, the camp administrators, from Matsuda down, arbitrarily abused the prisoners of war. Anyone who did not comply was whipped and beaten. Those who violated camp regulations were often summarily executed. After Haskins finished speaking, the prosecutor submitted documents signed by the American officers who were captured at the time, describing the various atrocities they suffered, as well as photos of the graves of the dead prisoners of war taken on the hills outside Changchun, with more than 140 crosses in the picture.

### Wan Molin is Expected to be Released on Bail

[Our Own Dispatch] It is reported that since Wan Molin was detained by the garrison command, his abdominal wound has recently flared up severely, and feces have been flowing out of the wound from time to time, which is quite serious. The warden of the prison, concerned about his responsibility, has reported the information to the commander. According to Article 114, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Procedure Law, if a detainee is ill to the point of life-threatening danger, he may be released on bail for medical treatment. Therefore, the Wan family's request for bail may be approved within days.

### British Ship to Arrive Today

### Various Prison Sentences: Jiang Jingyan, Lu Bingyuan, Li Zulai Continued Trial Yesterday

[Our Dispatch] The case of Li Zulai, the deputy manager of the puppet Central Bank of China, suspected of being a traitor, was heard again in the High Court yesterday afternoon. During the court's inquiry about the Fulai Qianzhuang (money shop), Li stated: "When the shop was first established, the total capital was 4 million in puppet currency, of which I only invested 20,000 in puppet currency. Later, the capital gradually increased, reaching 60 million in puppet currency by April of the 34th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1945]. However, I personally did not continue to increase my investment, remaining only with the initial 20,000 in puppet currency, which led to the loss of my qualification as a director. Later, the shop was reorganized, and I also left after April of the 34th year. I am not aware of what happened afterward. When I was responsible as the chairman, the business was losing money, so I wanted to reorganize it. I was not aware of the matter of lending money at an interest rate of 18%, and there was no speculation or manipulation at all. Other investments in more than a dozen money shops were only small amounts of 2,000 or 3,000 in puppet currency, and I did not hold any position." The defendant also retained three lawyers, Duan Tai Kai, Zuo De, and Shan Yu Hua, for defense. Li also requested the court to inquire with Du Yuesheng, Wan Molin, and others whether the defendant had any relationship with the central government in the past eight years. The court replied that it was not necessary, as the investigation was very detailed. Subsequently, Lu Bingyuan, a staff member of the Fulai Qianzhuang, was brought to court to inquire about the inside information of the shop in great detail. The case was adjourned for further hearing.

In addition, the cases of Chen Yongkang, a special high section detective of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, Wang Shouqing, the head of the fifth bao of the fourth district of the puppet Shanghai Maritime Baojia, and Cai A'gen, etc., were all adjourned for further hearing after witnesses were summoned and investigations were conducted.

On the same day, two cases were pronounced: Jiang Jingyan was sentenced to five years of imprisonment, and Lu Bingyuan was sentenced to two and a half years of imprisonment.

The cases of Wang Wei, the head of the fifteenth bao of the puppet Longhua Town, Zhou Wenrui, Liu Zhaoding, etc., were concluded yesterday, and the verdict is scheduled to be announced on the 13th of this month. In addition, the High Prosecutor's Office filed a lawsuit against La Jie on suspicion of being a traitor.

### The Fifth Congress of the General Labor Union Elected 54 Directors and Supervisors

### Pei Fei Talks about Post-War China: Not Receiving Deserved Rewards; Yan Huiqing and Others Attended a Welcome Reception by the Diplomatic Association and Gave Speeches

[Our Dispatch] Professor Pei Fei, an expert on Far Eastern affairs from the United States, has been invited to Shanghai and has been warmly welcomed by all sectors.

First, Xi Yushu, the chairman, delivered a welcome speech. Professor Pei Fei then gave a speech, stating: "Most of you present today are deeply involved in diplomatic research. With Dr. Yan Huiqing in attendance, I feel like I am showing off my skills before an expert. The meaning of diplomacy can be said to be peace or war, but it is often a disaster. Diplomacy is the exchange of ideas, beliefs, cultures, and concepts between different peoples. Therefore, I believe that if there were no diplomatic problems in the world, humanity might be happier. In a short period of time, we have encountered two world wars and learned profound lessons. But we must recognize that the year after a major war is the most difficult period for any country. Other situations are worse than during the war, except for the reduction in killings. We must make our best efforts to deeply study the crux of various disasters to alleviate human suffering."

### Site of the Congress: Yiyuan

(Our Dispatch) The site of the first Municipal Consultative Council of this city was originally scheduled to be held at the former German school on Daxi Road. However, because the terrain there is too low, it will be affected by heavy rain. At the same time, the venue is small and not enough to accommodate everyone. Therefore, the Municipal Consultative Council decided to change it to the Yiyuan Hotel on Shaanxi Road, which can accommodate 600 seats. The arrangement of the venue is planned as follows: in the center of the hall, facing the rostrum, there will be six rows of seats for councilors, with sixteen seats in each row. On the left and right sides, there will be forty-two seats each. Record seats will be set up on the left and right sides, and sixteen seats each will be set up on the left and right sides for municipal government personnel to attend. The outer circle of the councilor seats will be for reporters and guests. The corridor on the second floor of the hall will also have a gallery. The association stipulates that each councilor will be issued one gallery pass for relatives and friends to attend. The issue of alternate councilors attending the meeting is still pending decision by the Ministry of the Interior. Gallery passes are temporarily prepared, and those who wish to participate can go to collect them. In addition to the amplifier on the rostrum, another one is prepared for councilors to speak. The Consultative Council will require Yiyuan Hotel to move the tables and chairs in and out every day, as the hotel still needs to operate at night, so it is not planned to decorate the venue much. The bleachers outside the venue are intended to be used for rest and will be supplied with snacks and refreshments by Yiyuan Hotel, with prices at least double the market price.

### Nearly Two Hundred Proposals Received

In addition, the Municipal Consultative Council has received nearly two hundred proposals as of yesterday.

### Xi Yushu Resigns as Councilor; Wang Xiaolai Considering Whether to Accept or Decline

### Alternate Councilors Establish Friendship Association

Previously, the alternate councilors of this city, in order to strive for obligations, initiated the organization of a friendship association by Wang Zhimu, Yang Zhiqian, Yin Yong, and Wang Yangzhen, etc. The preparation has been going on for more than a month.

Wang Zhiben, Yang Zhiqian, Li Baosen, Wei Yunong, and Xie Dahuang were elected as the presidium. Wang Zhiben, Zhi

Dr. Yan Huiqing immediately stood up and said: "Thirteen years ago, at the League of Nations, I loudly called for the Manchurian problem to be resolved, otherwise we would have a second world war. At the time, no one believed me or paid attention. Six years ago, I traveled to various places at home and abroad and had already encountered countries preparing for war. Therefore, the United Nations hoped that the United States would lead the war. As a result, the United States was indeed able to lead and complete the mission of victory. The Chinese people need to have a deeper understanding of diplomatic issues, even of China's own issues. Professor Pei Fei has extensive research on international issues and a clear understanding of Chinese issues, which is unmatched by most people in our country. As the saying goes, 'The bystander sees the game best.' Professor Pei Fei will surely tell us with sincerity and frankness what the people of the world think of China, so that we can recognize the path we should take in the future and not be blinded."

When asked what attitude the Chinese people should take to observe the current situation, Mr. Pei expressed that he was unable to answer, but said that the Chinese should neither be advised by foreigners nor accept the advice of foreigners. However, it should be recognized that the current war is not the war of the 18th or 19th century, nor is it an internal war like the era of Zhang Zuolin and Feng Yuxiang. The overall situation should be studied with a general mentality.

Also asked: To what extent will the United States, in its international leadership position, be prepared to maintain its presence in the Far East? Mr. Pei replied that he could not speak on behalf of the US government, but in his personal opinion, the United States does not want to be a leader, and does not hope that [the] country [will] do this, but the United States will take on its due share of responsibility and do its best for world peace. Finally, Mr. Pei responded to Mr. Xi Yushu's question, "What do the general public in [the] country think of [the] country?", saying with emotion: "China has passed an era. This time when I returned to China, I found that China did not receive the rewards it deserved after eight years of hard fighting. I was quite disappointed with the impression I got."

### Stolen Money from the Rong Case Returned in a Handbag and Suitcase: 50,000 US Dollars as Reward for Director Mao and Subordinates; Gold Jewelry and Other Items May Be Returned to the Kidnappers' Families

[Our Dispatch] The stolen money recovered in the Rong Desheng kidnapping case was collected yesterday by Rong Dexin, a relative of Rong, and Xu Banggui, a staff member, at 3:50 PM from the Garrison Command. After all the US dollars, legal tender, and gold were counted in the office of the Chief of Military Justice, Rong Dexin signed and stamped the receipt and packed them fully in a small suitcase and canvas handbag that he brought with him. Before leaving, he said to Director Zeng, "I am very grateful for the efforts of the military and police agencies in solving the kidnapping case of Mr. Rong. A reward will be given to those who contributed to the effort, which will be decided after consulting Commander Xuan." When asked by reporters how the recovered stolen money would be disposed of, it was said that "in addition to a portion to reward the military and police personnel, the remaining amount will be donated to charity." Rong and others then took the money downstairs and left fully loaded in their own blue car number "11159." It was already 5:35 PM.

In addition to the portion of the stolen money recovered by the police bureau, which was reported yesterday, the Inspection Office of the Garrison Command handed over US$27,345 (including US$8,910 submitted by the First Pacification Zone), 98,115,200 legal tender, and 332 taels, 9 mace, 2 fen, and 8 liang of gold. The First Pacification Zone originally recovered US$58,910, 1,061,380 legal tender, and 119 taels and 9 fen of gold buttons. However, because Chairman's handwritten instructions were received to reward Director Mao Sen and his subordinates with US$50,000, and the amount of US$13,000 for the car purchased by Wu Zhigang, the remaining amount was only US$8,190, which was transferred to the police command. Therefore, what Rong Desheng's family actually recovered yesterday was US$94,745, 100,271,520 legal tender, and 332 taels, 9 mace, 2 fen, and 8 liang of gold. As for the gold jewelry, watches, and other items, they are temporarily held by the Military Justice Office and may be returned to the families of the kidnappers.

### Colonel of the Naval Fleet Command Secretly Accused of Embezzlement in Reception; Involved Stores Deny Investigation; Investigation Team Tracing Original Inventory List from the Processing Bureau

[Our Dispatch] Recently, someone sent a letter to the investigation team, secretly accusing Chen Yongqin, a current colonel of the Naval Fleet Command, who was responsible for receiving enemy and puppet Yangshupu warehouses, of using his power to seize civilian vehicles and steal warehouse materials, such as gasoline, wool, rice, sugar, soap, and hardware. Later, he used trucks to steal large quantities, colluding with his fellow townsmen Chi Hualong and Ruan, secretly selling them. After the investigation team arrived in Shanghai, they hurriedly sold off the stolen materials. The Camel Store on Ying Shi Road had purchased the stolen daily necessities. The secret report also stated that Chen Yongqin had lived in Shanghai since the outbreak of the 813 Shanghai Battle and had colluded with Ruan to work for the enemy.

After receiving the letter, the investigation team immediately sent people to the Camel Store and Chi Hualong's residence for investigation, but all parties denied the above situation. After collecting the customs reception inventory for verification, it was difficult to verify which of the Yangshupu warehouse reception inventories were sent by Chen Yongqin. Therefore, the investigation team sent a letter to the Processing Bureau for inquiry. Based on the index of the Customs' Gonghexing Warehouse Inventory List of the China Merchants Bureau compiled by the Customs, it was learned that there were no original inventory lists for items numbered 15, 16, 34, 35, 37, 137, 139, 201, 202, 349, 385, 488, 493, and 515 in the Customs inventory numbers.

Further investigation revealed that in the comparison table of cargo inventory from the Jianghai Customs reception inventory and the enemy's original inventory, there were cargos listed in the Customs inventory but not listed in the enemy's original transfer inventory. There were cargos in the Customs inventory that were more than those in the enemy's original inventory. There were cargos in the Customs inventory that were less than those in the enemy's original inventory. Regarding the investigation of this case, the investigation team is tracing the original inventory from the Enemy-Puppet Property Processing Bureau to clarify the truth.

*   Textile Construction Cloth Prices Remain Stable

Although there are no statistics on the actual quantity needed in South China, the amount bought by Guangbang and actually used in the various provinces of South China is probably not small. Therefore, it is deeply hoped that the government should conduct research on export restrictions.

### Abundant Share of Yarn Prices Rise
*   The Year's Harvest Sells At Special Prices

Yesterday, the yarn market had already turned stable. The Cantonese merchants' dumping of Double Horse was no longer seen, and colleagues took the opportunity to absorb the cheap yarn. Therefore, special Double Horse reappeared at the 1.5 million mark. Small and medium-sized yarns were favored by inland merchants, and prices also rose by 12,000 yuan. The Abundant Harvest and Water Moon brands were particularly scarce, because Textile Construction had not allocated them to yarn merchants for two weeks. In the morning at 10:00 AM, Textile Construction Company listed 20-count yarn for sale, with only the Blue Phoenix brand, and only the Li Ma short tube for 42-count yarn, with no large packages for sale. Therefore, the market price of double-stranded yarn increased by 45,000 yuan due to [blank]. 42-count Blue Phoenix was asking for 2.18 million yuan, and 20-count Blue Phoenix was asking for 1.334 million yuan, but there were very few transactions. The 40-count Silver Moon, which had no buyers during the week, had slight transactions yesterday, and the price also rose to 1.88 million yuan. Qingdao goods Fengdao were sold for 1.87 million yuan. According to people in the industry, the sluggish prices of yarn and cloth are due to the government's intention to suppress prices, the cooperation of various cotton products associations, state-owned and private manufacturers in selling at affordable prices, and the continued tightening of silver funds. In addition, the merchants' purchase of goods is complicated by loading, remittance, and other procedures, which take a long time, and the turnover of goods and funds is stagnant, which reduces purchasing power. This is also a major reason.

In order to train the principals of the central national schools and improve the efficiency of guiding national education, training classes were established in Suzhou and Zhenjiang last month. Although they lasted for only one month, the results were good. The department is now paying special attention to this work and has specifically organized a National Education Guidance Committee to conduct guidance work, so that the promotion of national education is widespread and extensive. As for the general registration of elementary school teachers in various counties, the department is currently conducting a major review. The salaries of elementary school teachers in various counties, starting from August, have been adjusted to a basic number of 55,000 yuan and a multiplicative number of 240. If the cost of living does not continue to rise, the teachers should be able to work with peace of mind. Finally, it was reported that the department has been striving to promote mass education since September and stipulates that multi-grade national schools should set up one mass education class, and central national schools should set up two classes, to promote adult and women's education. As for the counties in the province that have been recovered, there are 5,355 elementary schools that have been restored, with 17,351 teachers and 536,184 students.

### Tentative Suggestions for Improving Secondary Education in Shanghai (Continued)

— Xie Engao

For example, there are also hundreds of acres of land behind Song Park in the North District, known as Liuying. This property originally belonged to the city and was publicly owned. Before the war, there was a proposal to develop it into a public sports ground, but it was abandoned due to the outbreak of the war. The former site of the Labor University in Jiangwan, including the farmland, is also not small, and both are currently abandoned. The construction of a secondary education zone in the North District can utilize both of them. There are also many public lands along the north bank of the Huangpu River in South Shanghai. If a detailed investigation is conducted, there will definitely be discoveries. The land price in Pudong is currently not too high, and it is not impossible to requisition a base for a secondary education zone. Furthermore, the construction of the four secondary education zones can be completed in stages depending on the financial situation. Starting today, it is possible to begin with the West District first, as the land is already available there. If central permission is obtained, design and construction can begin. Each secondary education zone will use 300 to 400 acres for the construction of public buildings, and the remaining 30 to 40 acres will be designated as a middle school base. Each zone will have 40 middle school bases at most and 30 middle school bases at least, and the private secondary schools can freely lease them to build school buildings. Public buildings such as picture galleries, auditoriums, science laboratories, hospitals, music halls, art galleries, etc. will be built by the government in a unified manner according to actual needs, ensuring that the interior is fully equipped to meet the needs of the middle school students in the zone. Public utilities such as roads, ditches, bridges, water and electricity, gas, street lights, telephones, telegraphs, postal services, firefighting equipment, security equipment, flowers, gardens, lawns, and public transportation vehicles will also be the responsibility of the government, which will request the relevant competent authorities to plan, implement, and complete them. Life-related businesses such as public canteens, banks, bookstores, stationery stores, daily necessities stores, laundries, barbershops, and bathhouses will be tendered to merchants to build within the designated area, but they must donate a considerable amount of public buildings before they can obtain the right to operate these businesses. If the government feels that the funds for the public buildings to be built are insufficient, it may publicly solicit donations from the public. Regardless of whether it is an individual or an organization, the buildings donated will be named after the individual or organization to commemorate them for a long time. In this way, wealthy people who are enthusiastic about education will definitely be encouraged to participate in this righteous cause. The government can also establish one or two public secondary schools in each secondary education zone for demonstration purposes. The remaining private secondary schools will be solicited to lease the bases and raise funds to build their own school buildings within the specified time limit. The construction plans must be designed and prepared by experts, and the construction forms must be reviewed and approved by the government, ensuring that all aspects of the buildings are perfect in appearance and content. A small amount of rent will be charged for each school base, and the purpose is only to ensure that the property rights belong to the public. Since the government is responsible for planning important and special building equipment, all that the schools want to build themselves are ordinary classrooms, student and teacher dormitories, and offices. Compared to building each school separately, with each facility having to be self-funded, this saves a lot of money. After this plan is implemented, all high school and junior high school students must live on campus, and the power of education can permeate the entire lives of the students, allowing their minds to be in a process of mutual induction at all times, and their ideals to continue to grow. The incomplete and fragmented secondary education of today will be reduced invisibly. After a considerable period of time, it may be completely eliminated, and secondary education in Shanghai can be thoroughly transformed and completed. The issue of planning for construction funding is more difficult, but with the wealth of Shanghai, pooling the efforts of the government and society in many ways, and completing the project in stages, it seems not impossible. Now that the government has come up with a plan to plan a large education fund year by year, it is best to form a committee to fully utilize this education fund first, so as not to lose money day by day in the bank. When the amount is considerable, the interest can be allocated to the construction costs of public buildings in the secondary education zone. After the secondary schools in the city are moved in, the remaining school buildings and equipment in the city will be used to expand national education. In the future, in addition to national schools that can be scattered in the city, other secondary schools must be concentrated in the suburbs, and there will no longer be secondary schools that treat schools as transfer stations and teachers as knowledge vendors.

If the above plan is realized, secondary education in Shanghai will be greatly changed, and the predictable benefits are at least the following three points:

(1) Young people have an ideal education zone full of pleasure and adaptation needs, so they can completely leave the unfavorable real environment and live in a vibrant cultural field every day. After long-term orderly, meaningful, happy, and lively collective training and cultivation, they will surely be shaped into useful and capable backbones for the country and society.

(2) The teachers who run the schools, inspired and urged by the environment, and feeling the importance of youth education, the magnitude of their responsibility and the difficulty of their work, will inevitably rise up in the face of events, concentrate on their work, and hope to make a contribution to the country and society. They will never again be able to be as lax as in the past, not seeking improvement, or even having other purposes and using running schools as a means.

(3) Schools are run in a centralized manner, and teachers gather in one place, observing and studying each other, and competing with each other, all of which will help improve teaching methods and enhance communication. Not only that, but for all kinds of welfare undertakings for teachers, whether it is clothing, food, housing, or transportation, consumer cooperation can be implemented in any aspect, reducing the burden of teachers' lives and enabling them to truly achieve a happy and prosperous life.

Talking about improving secondary education in Shanghai is certainly not limited to improving material construction. However, if there can be a truly improved method in terms of material construction, then all other improvement issues can also proceed smoothly without much concern. If there is any inappropriateness, I hope that virtuous people will correct me!
