### Marshall Mediation Enters New Stage; Northeast Gloom Gradually Shows Signs of Clearing; Ceasefire Order May Be Issued Early Next Week

[Our Newspaper Chongqing Dispatch, 27th] The perilous and gloomy situation in the Northeast has, through the efforts of the Democratic League, the Youth Party, and non-partisan third-party individuals, along with the active progress of ceasefire talks in the Northeast, allowed Marshal Marshall's mediation talks to enter a new stage, showing a slight sign of clearing up. At 10:00 AM yesterday, Marshal Marshall once again invited Luo Longji and Zhang Junmai to discuss steps and plans for stopping military conflict in the Northeast and clarifying the serious situation there. However, Marshal Marshall's attitude was serious and cautious, and he expressed strong confidence in peace and the political situation in the Northeast. Marshal Marshall originally planned to leave Chongqing for Beijing today, but due to the alarming deterioration of the situation in the Northeast, he decided to wait for Chairman Chiang to return to Chongqing and for an agreement on the Northeast ceasefire issue to be reached before setting a departure date. It is also learned that at 7:00 PM last night, the Democratic League delegation invited Zhou Enlai, the representative of the Chinese Communist Party, to exchange views on the Northeast issue. It is reported that the opinions of the government and the Communist Party are quite close.

[Our Newspaper Beiping Dispatch, 27th] Well-informed observers say that a Northeast ceasefire agreement may be signed before Marshall flies to Beijing. They are certain that Chairman Chiang has made a major decision to compromise, but they say that this agreement should not shake the government's principle of receiving sovereignty, and at least the cities along the main Northeast railway line should be completely taken over by the government.

[Our Newspaper Beiping Dispatch, 27th] After the news of the impending signing of the Northeast ceasefire agreement in Chongqing reached here, the reporter visited Zheng Jiemin, a member of the Executive Headquarters, to inquire about the truth. Zheng said that as of now, the Executive Headquarters has not received any information from Chongqing regarding this matter, but he believes that this matter is possible, because the plan proposed by Marshal Marshall has been carefully considered for a long time, and it contains elements that both sides may accept. The reporter also learned from a certain source that the government will not give up the transfer of sovereignty over the Northeast, but the method can be reconsidered.

[United Press Chongqing Dispatch, 27th] Well-informed sources today strengthened their confidence, saying that the order to cease conflict in the Northeast may be issued early next week, and the final resolution of the political agreement and military issues will be discussed at a later meeting in Nanjing.

[Central News Agency Chongqing Dispatch, 27th] Special Envoy Marshall received Zhang Lan and Luo Longji, representatives of the Democratic League, at Yiyuan at 10:00 AM on the 27th, and the meeting lasted until 11:15 AM. After Zhang and Luo left, Marshal Marshall continued to discuss with Zhou Enlai, the representative of the Chinese Communist Party.

[Associated Press Chongqing Dispatch, 27th] Special Envoy Marshall is obviously doing his best to enable the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to reach a ceasefire agreement before moving to Nanjing. Marshal Marshall had a long meeting with Zhou Enlai this morning and went to Linyuan in the afternoon to continue negotiations after Chairman Chiang returned from Chengdu. Chen Cheng, the government representative of the three-person group, is now in Nanjing, and although the government has sent another representative to replace him, Chairman Chiang and Marshal Marshall are both willing to negotiate directly with the highest authorities of the three parties. It goes without saying that Chairman Chiang has full authority to sign any agreement. Zhou Enlai said that he has been authorized to sign an "unconditional ceasefire" agreement without having to ask for instructions from Yan'an. The Communist Party spokesman said that Communist leaders believe that there is hope for a Northeast ceasefire agreement to be reached before Marshal Marshall leaves Chongqing for Beijing. It is feared that Marshal Marshall will depart for Beijing on the 29th. If no ceasefire agreement is announced before his departure, it will be sufficient to indicate that a cessation of conflict will not be possible in the near future, but if Marshal Marshall postpones his departure for Beijing, it will indicate that the ceasefire agreement is still in progress. Although there is still no concrete manifestation here to prove that Marshal Marshall has enabled the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to reach a new ceasefire agreement, Chongqing is still shrouded in an atmosphere of optimism, and all parties seem to be working together to stop the war in the Northeast at least before the return to the capital.

### A Grand Gathering in Chengdu Yesterday Afternoon; Chairman Chiang Gave a Public Banquet for All Walks of Life; His Affection and Expectations for Sichuan Overflowed in His Words

[Central News Agency Chengdu Dispatch, 27th] As the National Government's Chairman Chiang is about to leave Sichuan after the victorious return to the capital, he bid farewell to the elders in Sichuan and held a public banquet at the Military Academy's New Life Society at 12:00 noon on the 27th for leaders of various institutions and organizations in the provincial capital, including dignitaries, scholars, party officials, government officials, military officials, and civilians, as well as virtuous members of society, senior officers of the Army and Air Force schools, descendants of fallen soldiers in the War of Resistance, and foreigners in Chengdu. A total of 241 people, including Liu Yubo, Shao Mingshu, Zhang Qun, Deng Xihou, Liu Wenhui, Huang Jilu, Xiang Chuanyi, Zhangjia, Li Huang, and Wu Yifang, gathered together, making it an unprecedented grand gathering in Chengdu. The Chairman entered to the sound of military music, and everyone stood at attention to pay their respects. The Chairman smiled and shook hands with Liu Yubo, who was nearly 90 years old, and Shao Mingshu, who was 75 years old, and nodded to the whole audience. During the meal, music was played from time to time, and the atmosphere was solemn and joyful. After the meal, the Chairman stood up and delivered a speech, explaining the glory of Sichuan in the history of the National Revolution, the status of Sichuan during the War of Resistance, and the importance of Sichuan in the future period of national construction, as well as the great responsibility of the Sichuan people for national construction. His words were earnest and moving (the full text will be published after being organized), and his deep affection for Sichuan and his high expectations for Sichuan overflowed in his words. When he mentioned that the Chengdu-Chongqing, Chengdu-Tianfu, Sichuan-Yunnan, and Sichuan-Guizhou railways and the Dujiangyan Hydropower Plant in western Sichuan would be completed within the next three to five years, the whole audience responded with warm applause that lasted for a long time. The speech lasted 34 minutes. After the speech, applause rose again, and Xiang Chuanyi, the Speaker of the Provincial Assembly, presented a signed commemorative album on behalf of the people from all walks of life, read a eulogy, and stated the hardships of the people and their enthusiastic support for the government's measures to build Sichuan. After the eulogy, the whole audience stood up and wished the Chairman good health. This was followed by a brief speech by Liu Yubo, and then a speech by Zhang Qun, the Chairman of Sichuan Province, who said that when Chairman Chiang came to Sichuan in the 24th year of the Republic (1935), he made stability, unification, and construction the three tasks of governing Sichuan. Stability and unification were achieved in a few years, so Sichuan was able to support the overall situation and shoulder the heavy responsibility of the base of the War of Resistance since the military campaign. However, construction was difficult due to wartime difficulties. After the war, the Chairman designated Sichuan as an experimental zone for construction, with the aim of accelerating the completion of Sichuan's construction. In fact, the Chairman had already instructed that construction was one of the three major tasks of governing Sichuan eleven years ago, which is enough to show that the Chairman has a consistent position on Sichuan. He then said that most of the War of Resistance was in Sichuan, and he also served as the Governor of the province for a year. Now that he is about to return to the capital and leave Sichuan, we cannot help but feel reluctant to leave. The Chairman also said that he regarded Sichuan as his second hometown, which is also a glory in Sichuan's history, and that future generations will always remember the Chairman's achievements in creating Sichuan as a base for national revival. From now on, the people of Sichuan should inherit the spirit of winning the war during the war and strive for the success of Sichuan's construction. They also hope that the Chairman will give instructions from time to time, and all sectors will work together to live up to the importance of Sichuan's position in the country. Finally, Shao Mingshu delivered a speech, saying that the entire territory of the country is under the Chairman's rule. Although he is now leaving Sichuan and returning to Nanjing, his teachings and leadership to the people of Sichuan in the future will not be different from Chongqing and Nanjing. This meeting, which is of great historical significance to Sichuan, did not end until 3:00 PM.

The Chairman also sent Yu Jishi, the Director of the Military Affairs Bureau, and Yan Xiaohu, the Commander of the Provincial Capital Garrison, to take gifts to the families of the fallen soldiers in the War of Resistance to express his condolences on his behalf.

### US Presidential Envoy for Famine Relief Hoover Changes Arrival Date to Tomorrow in Shanghai, Will Inspect Disaster Areas in Hunan and Guangxi

[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 27th] According to a telegram received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 22nd from our embassy in Egypt, former US President Hoover flew from Cairo to Chongqing on the 21st to investigate the postwar disaster situation in China, in order to allocate grain for relief. However, the US Embassy has not yet received notification. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has telegraphed New Delhi for inquiries and has notified the Gendarmerie Headquarters, the Municipal Government, the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the Ministry of Food, and the Ministry of Social Affairs to discuss reception arrangements. Premier of the Executive Yuan, Soong Tzu-wen, has offered his official residence at Hongyan Village as a reception center. The itinerary has been determined as follows: If Chairman Chiang is in Chongqing, the first evening banquet will be hosted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the Executive Yuan, the second day will involve an audience with Chairman Chiang, meetings with government officials, a luncheon hosted by the US Embassy, and an evening banquet hosted by the Chairman. If Chairman Chiang is away from Chongqing, the first evening banquet will be hosted by the Chongqing Municipal Government, the second day a luncheon by the US Embassy, and an evening banquet by the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.

[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] Hoover, the personal representative of the US President and representative of the US Emergency Relief Committee, originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 6:00 PM today, has postponed his arrival to tomorrow (Monday) afternoon due to delays in India. Various sectors are preparing a welcome. Yesterday at 3:00 PM, Minister of Food Hsu Kan convened a meeting at the UNRRA office with key figures from UNRRA and the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to hear reports and prepare for the visit of former US President Hoover, representative of the US Emergency Relief Committee. Attendees included UNRRA's China representative, Auster, UNRRA Director-General, Keyes, Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Director-General, Chiang Ting-fu, Shanghai Director, Liu Hongsheng, and many other key figures.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing Dispatch, 27th] Former US President Hoover, accompanied by his wife and 17 staff members, will visit China in early next month as the Chairman of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, planning to stay for seven days. It is expected he will spend one day in Shanghai, two days in Beijing, and a day and a half in Chongqing, before spending two and a half days inspecting the disaster situation in Hengyang, Guilin, Kaifeng, and Beiping.

[Reuters, Bangalore Dispatch, 27th] As Envoy Hoover traveled eastward by car through the famine area of Mysore Province, emaciated men and women, half-naked and starving, lined the roadside to welcome him. Some famine victims personally pleaded with Hoover for relief. The villages Hoover passed through yesterday were all in areas officially declared by the government as famine-stricken, where food rationing is extremely strict, and what is actually received is only about one-third of the rationed amount. Officials explained to Hoover that the food reserves there were insufficient for one month, and it was better to keep the villagers half-starved now than to let them starve to death next month. Upon arriving in Madhugiri, Hoover addressed the residents, announcing his decision to transport grain for relief. He stated that in solving the food crisis, the food problem in China should not be neglected. If we want to understand the extent of the food shortage in China today and what relief methods to take, we must delve into the disaster areas for on-the-spot investigation and explore the root cause in order to find a solution. Harrison also said: Having arrived in China only a week ago, he has listened to the reports from both UNRRA and the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration on the survey findings and their relief efforts for the disaster victims. Harrison believes that China lacks concrete statistics for the production and distribution of various foods, making the work more difficult than in other countries. He is now awaiting instructions from Washington before commencing work. He and his three staff members hope to personally inspect the disaster areas in the near future and then prescribe the right remedies.

### Wang Maogong Discusses Inspection Impressions: Order Restored, Construction Prospects Hopeful

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 27th] Upon Chairman Wang Maogong of Jiangsu Province's return from inspection, our reporter visited him. He kindly shared his impressions of this trip, excerpted and recorded on the right: (1) In Jiangyin, 60% of the houses were destroyed by the enemy and puppets during the War of Resistance, and the people's economy is extremely strained. Now that order has been restored, the people are able to live and work in peace, and the relationship between local party, government, military, and organizations is very harmonious. (2) The discipline of the Nantong security team is excellent, and social order is more stable than before. Construction prospects are hopeful. Secondary education is still inadequate, and the local area has added a private school to accommodate more students. The county currently has seven districts that have established a political foundation. Refugees have gathered in the urban area, with over 100,000 residents. It is hoped that a large amount of grain, medicine, and relief supplies will be quickly allocated and transported for relief. (3) Elders and representatives of public opinion organs in various places have focused their discussions on strengthening public security and enriching autonomous finances. The provincial government will work hard to reorganize autonomous donations and taxes and request subsidies from the central government to achieve a balance of income and expenditure. (4) Wuxi and Nantong are both industrial areas in Jiangsu Province. Although many factories have resumed operations, due to a lack of various conditions, they are still far from pre-war standards and require further efforts. A stable environment is necessary to ensure the prosperous development of construction enterprises.

[Associated Press, Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] National Assembly representatives are still arriving in Beijing one after another, some from as far as India and Thailand. With both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party continuing to vie for political and military advantages in the Northeast, there is a growing sense here that the Assembly may be postponed for up to a month. Yan'an predicted a month ago that the Assembly would not be able to convene until June, or even later. The Communist Party has long hoped that the Assembly would be held in October, allowing all parties ample time to adjust important national issues.

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 26th] After the postponement of the National Assembly, representatives from Hunan and Hubei provinces remaining in Hankou expressed surprise and regret. In addition to holding symposiums to discuss countermeasures, they have agreed to travel to Beijing together on a scheduled date to urge the Assembly to be held as scheduled in order to maintain the government's credibility.

### Chen and Miao, Two Traitors, Both Submit New Exculpatory Evidence, Possible Retrial, Two Female Hanjians from Yunnan Sent to the Supreme Court for Investigation and Trial

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 27th] Chen Gongbo and Miao Bin, two traitors, have both applied for retrial because they disagree with their death sentences. Recently, people from all walks of life have been greatly concerned about whether the Supreme Court will overturn the original judgment and order a new retrial, and there have been rumors that the retrial dates have been determined. In order to clarify the truth, our reporter visited Sun Honglin, the President of the Jiangsu High Court, on the 27th to inquire. He told us that the two traitors' applications for retrial documents and first instance case files were only sent to the Supreme Court on the 25th. Although Miao's documents were sent out more than ten days ago, the High Court has not received any news. Moreover, the Supreme Court does not need to expedite the handling of Hanjians' retrial cases. The outside rumors are just speculation. Our reporter then asked about his opinion on the two traitors' applications for retrial. He replied that according to legal procedures, the Supreme Court has no more than the following three dispositions: (1) To consider the submitted documents and directly uphold the sentence for execution. (2) To issue a retrial order not limited to the original trial court. (3) To issue a retrial order to the original trial court. However, since both Chen and Miao have submitted new exculpatory evidence, the Supreme Court's decision will most likely be the third option. The reporter continued to ask if Chen Bijun and Chu Minyi had requested retrials. He replied that the High Court had not received any written applications to date. The reporter further inquired whether the government's amnesty would apply to Hanjians. He replied that it depends on the amnesty regulations. However, Hanjians are criminals against the country and the nation, endangering the foundation of the nation. Their impact is not as limited as ordinary criminal offenses that only affect individuals or a small number of people. It seems extremely unlikely that they will be granted amnesty, otherwise, where would the national discipline lie? President Sun finished speaking with indignation. The reporter then took his leave and departed.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 27th] The Hebei High Court will start investigating the giant Hanjians recently transferred to the court today. The first one is Xu Xiuzhi, the former mayor of the puppet Beijing government. The public trial may be held in a week. After Wang Yitang was transferred to the court, his illness was once critical, but he has recently improved and is living in prison with Dong Kang for medical treatment. Zhou Diping and others from Tianjin were also transferred to the Hebei High Court First Branch on the 26th. Dean Fei Liang came to Beiping yesterday to ask for instructions on the transfer and trial procedures. Regarding the Hanjians' property, it will be sold at auction after the judgment, and the funds will be transferred to the national treasury.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] Beiping Dispatch: The North China Hanjians detained in the Army Prison will be publicly tried by the Hebei High Court within three weeks. Wang Yitang is suffering from severe heart disease and is currently receiving a cardiotonic injection every four hours to prolong his life. It is also reported that Wang Yintai and Wang Shijing will be transferred to Beijing for interrogation.

[Central News Agency, Kunming Dispatch, 26th] The Yunnan Garrison Headquarters transferred two female Hanjian suspects, Wang Ying and Chou Shuyi, to the High Court on the 25th. Wang is from Guangdong, 22 years old, and was a film worker. Chou is a newcomer, 20 years old, with a Japanese mother, and was arrested in Kunming a year ago.

### Capital High Court Established, Zhao Chen Sworn in as President

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] The Capital High Court was established on the morning of the 27th.

### Sichuan Grain Continuously Transported to Hankou

Hankou Yarn Industry Association Strikes

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 26th] 185 tons of Sichuan grain arrived in Hankou City yesterday and have been handed over to the Provincial Field and Grain Office for distribution to the garrison troops. An official in charge told our reporter that the transportation problem of Sichuan grain relief to Hankou has been resolved. The section from Chongqing to Yichang has chartered five vessels: Minhui, Minxie, Minyun, Minfu, and Minwu, each capable of carrying 50 tons. From Yichang to Hankou, it will be transported by tugboat barges, so Sichuan grain arriving in Hankou will become a steady stream. (Another dispatch) The price of yarn in Hankou City has been fluctuating. The reason is that China Textile Corporation transported 20,000 bales of foreign yarn from Shanghai but did not hand them over to the Yarn Industry Association for sale at parity prices. The Yarn Industry Association has questioned China Textile Corporation and has unanimously gone on strike from yesterday.

Editorial

### Two Years of Democracy's Important Events

—Postponement of the National Assembly and the Election of Shanghai Municipal Senators—

Recently, two things have a significant relationship with the future of China's implementation of democratic politics: The first is that on the 25th of this month, the National Government suddenly issued an order announcing the postponement of the National Assembly scheduled for May 5th, without specifying a new date. The second is today's election of the first session of municipal senators by the citizens of Shanghai. We would like to offer some opinions on these two matters:

The National Assembly, which the people have been eagerly awaiting, has been postponed by order of the National Government. Although the government has its own difficulties, especially with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek maintaining a modest and receptive attitude, expressing the determination to strive for a peaceful resolution of the political impasse, which deserves our respect, the general public's judgment of right and wrong remains clear. The people have long recognized the true face of the Communist Party, which harbors conspiracies to obstruct the National Assembly, more clearly than the government's constant struggles and the Allied envoy General Marshall. From the perspective of democratic politics, the most incomprehensible thing is: Why do these "democracy" peddlers, who usually boast and sing praises of "democracy," obstruct it in every possible way when the people are truly about to be in charge?

The National Assembly was scheduled to convene before the War of Resistance, and representatives from various regions had already been elected, but it was forced to be postponed due to the outbreak of the war. At that time, we only knew that the Communist Party and politicians who echoed them criticized the government for not convening the National Assembly sooner. When the government set the date for November 12th of last year, after the Japanese invaders had already surrendered, it was reasonable to convene as scheduled. However, this group of "democracy" peddlers, while holding armed separatist regimes in various regions, also shouted slogans of "peace and unity," stubbornly preventing the convening of the National Assembly, even resorting to alarmist claims, shamelessly stating that if they were not consulted first, convening the National Assembly would be tantamount to creating a "civil war." In order to strive for peace, the government, with the sincerity of a political solution, convened the Political Consultative Conference. After several consultations, it was finally agreed that the National Assembly would be convened as scheduled on May 5th of this year, and the number of representatives from various parties and so-called "social elites" was stipulated, trying to accommodate the opinions of their so-called "democratic" parties in order to achieve satisfactory results. The common people eagerly waited for the National Assembly to establish a constitution, believing that democratic politics could finally be realized. However, the Communist Party, on the one hand, conspired to rely on a powerful neighbor, occupying the Northeast and sowing the seeds of a future second puppet Manchuria. On the other hand, using the Northeast issue and the number of government committee members as pretexts, they always held back their "Democratic League," jointly refusing to submit the list of National Assembly representatives, in order to prevent the convening of the National Assembly and to coerce the government into making concessions. According to reason and law, since the government had repeatedly announced to the people that the National Assembly would be convened on a fixed date and had vowed not to postpone it again, it could have been ignored at this point. However, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek ultimately respected the opinions of all parties and decided to postpone the convocation. For the government, this can be described as having done its utmost, but from the perspective of democracy, it is not the normal way and should not be taken as a model. However, this responsibility should clearly be borne solely by the Communist Party.

Under a democratic political system, the people should be valued most, not a few factional politicians. We currently cannot understand: Why does the government seem to only recognize a few "democracy" peddlers from various parties, while neglecting the true masters of the country—the people? The National Assembly, which the people have been waiting for for nearly a decade, was finally about to be born, but it was postponed due to the eloquent words of a few "democracy" peddlers. Is it only the opinions of the Communist Party and the Democratic League that are "public opinion," while the opinions of other parties and the general public do not count as public opinion at all? Is it only the opinions of certain anti-government parties that should be "respected," while the opinions of the general public can be completely ignored? It is true that the people desire peace and oppose war; but what the people hate most are those violent groups who chant peace while engaging in fighting! The Communist Party chants peace, so it deprives the National Army of its right to self-defense, allowing the National Army to only be beaten and not allowed to fight back. The Communist Party engages in fighting, so it obstructs the government's takeover of the Northeast, allowing only the Communist Party to establish a separatist regime and not allowing administrative unification. And now, some people still believe that the government wants to use "military solutions," and some people believe that "military solutions" will eliminate democracy. In reality, the Communist Party is the one who most wants military solutions! Just look at how, after seizing Changchun and Harbin, the Communist Party loudly proclaimed that the overall situation in the Northeast had changed, that the Communist Party was unwilling to make any more concessions, and that it forced the central government to recognize their so-called "Democratic Allied Forces" and "Democratic Regime." From this, we can know how the Communist Party is obsessed with military solutions and how it entrusts its so-called "democracy" to the military force that it temporarily obtained by illegally using enemy weapons and equipment! If the National Government respects their opinions simply because they have some military force, believing that this is public opinion, then we must speak out for the people in northern Jiangsu, Shandong, and the Northeast, who unfortunately do not have this kind of military force! We ask, do those people truly want to be ruled by the Communist Party's "democratic government"? Honestly speaking, the people in those areas all hope that the National Army will come quickly to protect their lives, and they all hope for the arrival of the central government's orders, just like waiting for rain during a severe drought. They are still blaming the central government every day for sitting idly by while they are trapped in the midst of fire and water. The representatives they elected have already arrived in Nanjing, ready to attend the National Assembly and make normal appeals. Where would they hope for the National Assembly to be postponed?

Moreover, the National Assembly representatives from Shanghai, Nanjing, and even other regions have recently been advocating that they should still gather in Nanjing as scheduled, awaiting the central government to set a new date for the meeting as soon as possible. This is public opinion, this is true public opinion. Whoever wants democracy, whoever wants to implement democratic politics, must respect this true public opinion. The opinions of certain parties and the opinions of these National Assembly representatives, when measured on the scale of "democratic politics," should undoubtedly be weighted more heavily than the former. Moreover, to truly prevent the outbreak of "civil war" in China, the only way is to convene the National Assembly as soon as possible, listen to the voices of true people's representatives, and let the people themselves, in their capacity as masters, impartially judge the affairs of the country. Everyone uses words instead of violence, which is the right path to democracy. Therefore, although the government has postponed the convocation of the National Assembly out of sincere consultation, believing that this can leave room for maneuver and resolution, in our view, this kind of breach of faith and indulgence will inevitably lead to a more chaotic situation. After the postponement of the National Assembly was announced, the Communist Party openly proposed to revise the "Political Consultative Conference" agreement, which is another manifestation of their inching forward. It is conceivable that postponing the convening of the National Assembly cannot resolve the impasse, or may even increase troubles. The true intentions of the people are definitely not what they expect from the government. Therefore, today we have the right to demand that the government, in addition to the so-called "parties," truly investigate where the true intentions of the people lie. We also have the right to demand that the government must value the opinions of the elected National Assembly representatives from various regions and quickly convene the National Assembly in the near future. This is the only great path to lead China onto democratic politics!

Secondly, we want to talk about the election of municipal senators in Shanghai. Shanghai is China's first trading port, with a large population, thriving industry and commerce, and municipal administration that needs to be promoted, which is indeed a concern for both Chinese and foreign observers. This election is also urgent after the temporary municipal council has held a meeting once, and it is also appropriately timed at the unification of administrative power with the recovery of concessions, therefore the establishment of a formal public opinion institution should be highly valued by the citizens. Recently, the enthusiastic competition of candidates seems to have created a new atmosphere of democracy, which is not a phenomenon unworthy of celebration. Even if some people think that receptions, tea parties, banquets, etc., are inevitably wasteful, but since everyone wants democracy, as long as there are no illegal acts, no corrupt schemes, then using various methods to attract voters to promote candidates, in Western democratic countries, is also "common practice." Just look at the film "Wilson" that was recently screened in Shanghai, and you can get a glimpse of it. As for those who have personally witnessed the grand occasion of elections in various European and American countries, they will naturally not be surprised. "Democratic politics," in some places, is originally a money-consuming politics, it is also a time-consuming politics, and it is even more a politics that consumes a lot of talking. If you want democracy in your heart, but you think you can't get used to these things when you see them, this is due to our inertia and our accumulated habits. First of all, everyone must transform our old concept of "three visits to the thatched cottage," believing that in the era of democratic elections, we must sit at home and wait for a gentleman to come and ask for an audience. If this is really the case, then in the advanced countries of Western democracy, they would not have campaign speeches and campaign broadcasts. Also, after listening to campaign speeches or broadcasts, everyone criticizes each other, attacks each other, and fights with each other. As long as they do not violate the defamation law, it is not surprising to see them laughing, scolding, and scolding each other. Currently, we only see a few slogans, a few leaflets, a few speeches, and a few tea parties, and we immediately discuss them in the streets and alleys, believing that this trend cannot last long; in fact, these are all thoughts that do not conform to the democratic era!

However, we would like to solemnly inform all qualified voters in Shanghai that today everyone must cherish the election ticket that they should cast. We were not only very pleased and excited to hear the news that Mayor Qian will personally go to the polling station to vote, but we also sincerely hope that all voters in Shanghai, regardless of gender, wealth, or poverty, will use the receipt of their national ID card to solemnly go to the polls and carefully consider the ideal candidate in their minds and elect him as a senator. The Kuomintang's political tutelage is to train the people to exercise four kinds of political power, and today's election of municipal senators is the official beginning of Shanghai citizens' exercise of the right to vote. "The beginning is easy, but the end is great!" We must know that today's vote is not just a vote, it is related to the entire municipal administration of Shanghai, and it is even more related to the local foundation of democratic politics in the country. If today's election of local self-government can be ignored, then in the future, we will not be able to muster interest in the election of the central government; democratic politics can never build its foundation on the bodies of people who have no interest or enthusiasm for politics! Today we have nothing else to say, but to advise every voter to cherish his own election ticket. Cherishing one's own vote is the beginning of democratic politics, and it is also the success of democratic politics!

Addendum: Today's "Sunday Forum" will be published as a special essay tomorrow. Reporter

When patrolling guards saw it and reported the alarm, the prisoners had already destroyed the outer wall and escaped. After checking the roll call, it was discovered that Jin Guanqing, a convicted bandit who was appealing, as well as Yang Guanxing, Tao Jinxiang, Wang Guosheng (a murderer), Pu Jinfa, Ma Xing (a police officer from Ye Xie who committed murder), Liang Damao (a thief), and Yin Quan (a fraudster), totaling nine people, had been reported by Director Feng for pursuit, but they have not been captured yet.

Hangzhou

Municipal Government Plans to Construct Wushan

Wushan in Hangzhou is a historical site and also the high point in the bustling city of the provincial capital. The open space in the mountains, if it were in European and American countries, would be well utilized, but we have abandoned it, which is a pity. Now, at the suggestion of the Municipal Provisional Council, in order to revitalize the commercial market, it is planned to establish an amusement market on Wushan, and to set up ticket offices at the surrounding Cuihuan Tower and Liangdao Mountain, and install elevators to facilitate tourists. All temples with historical relics will be preserved, and temples with superstitious colors will be requisitioned for public use as government property, designed and converted into hotels, restaurants, and other shops and stalls, like the Andong Market in Beiping. The municipal government has instructed the relevant departments to jointly review and implement this plan.

Hefei

Precursor to Construction of Xinliu Highway

The Pushan Road, which was started in the 3rd year of the Republic of China, was halted due to the First World War. The Heye Road, which was started in the 26th year of the Republic of China, was also interrupted due to the outbreak of the War of Resistance, causing the traffic between western Anhui and Henan and Hubei to be blocked until now. Now, the Second District Engineering Administration of the Highway Administration of the Ministry of Transportation has decided to build the Han, Tian, and Liuliu Roads to facilitate the intersection of traffic in Anhui, Henan, and Hubei.

### Foreign Ministers Conference Proceeding Smoothly Italy Issue Agreed Upon Soviet Union Opposes Discussion of Austrian Issue Bevin Flew Back to London Yesterday to Seek Instructions

[Our newspaper] London, 27th (broadcast): The four-power foreign ministers are scheduled to hold their third meeting this afternoon (i.e., 4:00 a.m. on the 28th in Shanghai) to strive for an agreement to include the Austria-Germany issue on the agenda. The United States requested a discussion on the Austrian issue, but the Soviet Union opposed it. Generally speaking, the atmosphere of this meeting is quite harmonious, completely different from the table-thumping and shouting scenes at the London conference. There are no serious conflicts between the representatives of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and the Soviet representative Molotov is very steady in his attitude.

Another report: Tomorrow is Sunday, and although the four-power foreign ministers will not hold a meeting, they will not rest. They will discuss the contents of the treaty with Italy with their military, naval, and political advisors. (Another report) British Foreign Secretary Bevin flew back to London after the meeting today to seek instructions and meet with South African Prime Minister Smuts, and decided to return to Paris on Monday. Currently, the Soviet Union is accepting the US proposal to amend the Allied armistice agreement with Italy.

[Associated Press, Paris, 27th] The four-nation foreign ministers' conference has reached a critical stage today, and the United States seems to be determined to insist on the withdrawal of the occupying forces of various countries stationed in Austria, regardless of Soviet opposition, and to recognize Austria as a truly independent country. Byrnes said that he is prepared to ask all countries to accept the US-proposed handling of Austria at today's meeting, and at the same time propose that the port of Trieste should still belong to Italy. It is expected that the four-nation foreign ministers will make a decision on the above two issues or one of them at today's meeting. (According to authoritative sources in London, Bevin will suggest to Byrnes that the Pacific Defense Conference be held by the US, Britain, Australia, and New Zealand in Canberra to prepare for the future seven-power conference, when France, Portugal, the Netherlands, and other countries will be invited to participate again. Australian Prime Minister Chifley may go to Washington within two weeks to discuss with President Truman the issue of joint defense of Surabaya, Batavia, and Timor proposed by Australia.)

[Associated Press, Paris, 26th] The foreign ministers of the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, and France held a second meeting in the Luxembourg Palace today. An agreement has been reached on the issue of Italian reparations, but opinions are still divided on whether to include the Ruhr and Austrian issues on the agenda. At the meeting, the controversial points of the Italian peace treaty were discussed first, and then it was decided in principle that Italian reparations should be limited to what it can afford. The four foreign ministers have also agreed on the preamble of the treaty, stating that Italy should be held responsible for the war's calamity. The original American text for demanding any compensation from Italy was followed by the Soviet request for Italy to pay substantial compensation, but stipulated that a committee of experts should investigate the country's ability to pay. The Soviet Union reiterated its request for Italy to pay 300 million US dollars in reparations. The United States only allowed Italy to pay reparations without borrowing from foreign countries. When the committee of experts decides on its ability to pay, it cannot strip its factory equipment, various machines, armory settings, and merchant ships. The Italian navy, which the Soviet Union is concerned about, was not mentioned. The current worry is that if Italy can pay reparations without borrowing from the US and Britain, then the US and Britain may also raise demands.

[Associated Press, Washington, 26th] Acting Secretary of State Acheson announced today that the United States, the Soviet Union, and France have agreed to accept the US proposal to amend the Italian armistice agreement signed 30 months ago, so as to ease the armistice conditions.

### Security Council's Impasse on the Spanish Question May Be Broken Soviet Representative Has Telegraphed Molotov for Instructions Madrid Military Region Cancels Leave for Officers and Soldiers

[Our newspaper] London, 27th (broadcast): The stalemate in the Security Council caused by the Franco issue now has the possibility of being broken. Although the Soviet representative still firmly opposes investigating the situation in Spain, he has telegraphed Molotov for instructions on whether to concede to the compromise proposal of the representatives of Australia, France, and Poland. It is expected that the foreign ministers of the United States and Britain will urge Molotov in Paris not to allow the Security Council to fall into a complete stalemate.

[Associated Press, New York, 26th] The Security Council was again deadlocked on the Spanish issue today. It is now hoped that the Soviet Union, which holds a dissenting opinion, can change its attitude so that the Australian proposal to investigate the Franco regime in Spain can be unanimously passed. The representatives have clearly agreed to the proposal revised twice by the Australian representative Hodgson (see yesterday's newspaper for the new proposal), but the Soviet representative Gromyko disagrees. Gromyko opposed sending any committee or delegation to investigate Spain yesterday, saying that Spain has long become a threat to world peace, and there is no need for further investigation. If so, the Soviet Union will definitely insist on its position against the new proposal.

[Associated Press, Madrid, 26th] According to today's news: Routine leave for the Spanish army in the Madrid military region has been canceled, and soldiers must report back to camp on Monday. Although officials have not confirmed this news, United Nations officials said that this action is not surprising, because the Spanish government has publicly stated that it is paying attention to the situation on the French-Spanish border, saying that there is considerable Communist-inspired activity there. According to another source: The two divisions under the command of General Grande, who previously participated in the war against the Soviet Union in the "Blue Division," are now stationed in the Madrid military region, awaiting orders to move out.

### US Military Seizes Large Quantities of Mongolian Counterfeit Money in Japan

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 27th special cable] The US occupation forces discovered 258 boxes of Mongolian banknotes printed by Japan, with a value of 800 million Japanese yen, completely new, in a freight yard at the port of Tsuruga in northern Honshu. It is said that the banknotes were intended to be used in Inner Mongolia, and used at the same wartime face value as the Japanese yen.

### Threat to Peace: The Soviet Union! Remarks by U.S. Congressman Barry

[United Press International, Washington, 27th] Democratic Congressman Barry stated today that if the United States were to investigate Spain, then the United States should also investigate all countries behind the Soviet Union's Iron Curtain. Barry telegraphed Stettinius, saying, "All non-Communist representatives in United Nations organizational meetings know that the only country that may threaten world peace is not Spain, but the Soviet Union. The American people do not wish to appease the Soviets any further. Now is the time to exert the leverage we still have, and we should stop here. Every time we encounter Soviet hostility, we either reach a stalemate or the Soviet Union wins, and America's dignity in the world is becoming weaker day by day." Barry concluded by saying that a communist Spain would control Britain's lifeline in the Mediterranean and place the European countries that have not yet become communist under Moscow's control.

### Anniversary of the San Francisco Conference: Truman Delivers Message

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 26th] Today marks the first anniversary of the opening of the San Francisco Conference. The U.S. government held a special banquet to entertain all representatives of the United Nations Security Council, and President Truman's message was read on the spot, stating: "A year ago today, nations began building institutions during the war to maintain unity after peace, which is a day worth commemorating. A year ago, this organization was just a hope; today, it has become a reality. The United Nations General Assembly, the Security Council, and the Economic and Social Council were all unrealized ideals a year ago, but today they are all active institutions. The International Court of Justice has been established, and the United Nations Secretariat is also active, with only the Trusteeship Council yet to be formed. The achievements of the past year are truly remarkable. The world before today will come with our spirit of contribution. This spirit is given consistency to complete the unfinished work."

### Churchill's Speech: The World is Seriously Ill; All Humanity is Suffering from Confusion and Pain: Victors and Vanquished Alike

[Reuters, Aberdeen, 27th] Churchill said in a speech here today: "The world is now seriously ill, full of mutual hatred. All humanity is suffering from confusion and pain, victors and vanquished alike. The two terrible wars we have experienced in our lifetime have torn apart the heart of love and culture. The 'Christian civilization' of the 19th century is now almost completely destroyed, but science is advancing, which is driven by war. Science in the hands of the masses has surpassed the development of reason, and humanity's spiritual capacity has also been exhausted, leading to bloodshed. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a period of recovery; humanity cannot withstand further blows in its current state."

### Soviets Actively Dismantling Factories in German Occupied Zone; No Fewer Than 170 Factories Dismantled; Factory Owner Tried to Flatter Soviets, Was Taken Away

[United Press International, Berlin, 26th] The Soviet Union continues to dismantle factories in the German occupied zone, which is currently in full swing. According to estimates by the Industrial Management Office of the occupied zone, no fewer than 160 to 172 factories have been dismantled recently. The Walfen factory in Saxony, which supplied colored film to the Soviet occupation authorities to capture footage of the victory parade in Moscow, was immediately ordered to have its machinery dismantled and moved to the Soviet Union due to its excellent work. A paper mill in Neugalis, Mecklenburg, specializing in the production of high-quality thick paper for certificates and scrolls, has also been instructed by the Soviet Union to have its troops dismantle and relocate it. The factory owner, who also serves as the mayor, was quick-witted and declared to the Soviet army that the factory's equipment was outdated and that he would personally go to Leningrad to build a modern new paper mill for them. The Soviet military commander reported this to his superiors, who replied: "The person can be brought along as well, and a new factory can be built later." The Horch automobile factory in Saxony, which manufactures high-end automobiles, is currently dismantling its machinery in preparation for transportation to the Soviet Union. In addition, the sixteen largest paper mills in the Soviet occupied zone are being dismantled and transported eastward. According to orders, half of the equipment from Germany's largest nitrogen plant near Morsenburg will be en route to the Soviet Union by May 15th. According to experts, the factory's machinery and equipment are exceptionally complex and will take two years to completely dismantle. The Soviet Union's dismantling of these factories should be explained by stating that the Potsdam Agreement guarantees the Soviet Union 15% of the industrial equipment from the western occupied zones of Germany, but it is difficult to wait for an agreement to be established with other related countries. Other related countries have different views on what is "necessary for Germany's peacetime economy" than the Soviet Union. Therefore, if they do not concede to the Soviet Union's demands for certain factories, a four-country expert committee will carefully examine German industry to determine compensation issues. This is another reason why the Soviet Union is eager to dismantle German factories because once they are dismantled, the committee cannot include them in the compensation plan.

### Indian Congress Party President Acharya Decides to Retire; Nehru Nominated to Succeed as President; Anglo-Indian Negotiations to Reopen Soon

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 26th] The President of the Indian National Congress Party, Acharya, recently told the press that he has decided to retire and has nominated Nehru to succeed as president. The Congress Party's National Executive Committee will hold a meeting in May and has included the retirement of President Acharya on the agenda. This move is sufficient to promote Nehru's early assumption of the presidency. Appointing a Hindu as the president of the National Congress Party is of great significance. The reason for this is that Muslim leader Jinnah is unwilling to associate with Acharya. (Note: The Congress Party is mostly composed of Hindus and claims to represent all the people of India. Therefore, in the last election, they chose the Muslim Acharya as president to show impartiality).

[Reuters, New Delhi, 27th] The British Cabinet delegation will do everything possible to unite the various parties in India and form a provisional government to achieve a preliminary resolution of the Indian issue. Therefore, today, they invited the Speaker of the Indian National Assembly and the President of the Muslim League to nominate representatives to continue negotiations with the British delegation.

### Coalition Negotiations Between Japan's Liberal and Socialist Parties Break Down; Socialist Party Insists on Taking Premiership; Opportunity for Shidehara to Make a Comeback Increases

[Special Dispatch from Our Tokyo Correspondent, 27th] Last night, the committee of the Liberal, Socialist, Cooperative, and Communist parties held a meeting to discuss forming a coalition government. The debate lasted for two hours without any results because the Socialist Party still wanted to hold the position of Prime Minister in the new cabinet, while the Liberal Party firmly opposed it. At 1:00 PM today, Socialist Party leader Katayama visited Liberal Party leader Hatoyama and discussed it again for an hour and twenty minutes. Immediately afterward, he held a press conference and admitted that the negotiations had failed. The leaders of the various parties will visit Shidehara tomorrow to discuss everything. It is the first time that the cabinet has been so difficult to produce.

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 27th] Japanese Progressive Party leader Nakai said that since cooperation between the Liberal Party and the Socialist Party is impossible, the opportunity for Shidehara to make a comeback has greatly increased. He smiled as he said this.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 27th] General observation suggests that Liberal Party Foreign Minister Yoshida may be appointed as the new Prime Minister.

### International Bank to Issue First Public Bonds Within Six Months; May Be Traded in Foreign Commercial Centers

[Associated Press, New York, 26th] The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development may issue its first public bonds within six months, which are expected to be eagerly sought after. Although international bank bonds are very different from ordinary public bonds, they will also be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Savings banks and trust companies in New York have been authorized to use these public bonds as investments. A total of 38 countries are participating in the International Bank, but the amounts subscribed by each country cannot be paid up immediately because the amount collected each time cannot exceed 20% of the total amount subscribed by each country of 9.1 billion. Therefore, the bank must issue public bonds to obtain the necessary funds to help countries affected by the war undertake reconstruction work. According to Lo Chaim, a foreign investment consultant for the Securities and Exchange Commission, international bank bonds may be traded on securities exchanges and other foreign commercial centers. It is expected that the bank will first issue smaller denomination bonds of 10,000 each to test the purchasing situation before issuing larger denomination bonds.

With this confession, the police have obtained clues and will be able to arrest the relevant perpetrators again in the near future.

### Young Jewish Girls are Cold-Blooded Killers; Fighting to the Death for Immigration Goals

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 27th] A "New York Times" reporter claims that over a dozen teenage girls have been discovered in Palestine participating in terrorist activities. These girls charge into battle and kill without blinking an eye, making the killing monsters in American movies seem inferior. These girls were among those who attacked the Sixth Airborne Division's parking lot on Thursday night. As early as January, a teenage Jewish girl, Braha Fult, died while participating in an attack on the Sharona police station. Thousands of Jewish youths, many of whom were teenage girls, attended her funeral on Thursday morning. They held up banners praising the deceased as "fighters for immigration." Before the tomb, these thousands of young people swore to follow in the footsteps of the deceased, convinced that Jewish immigration is a legitimate goal and that they should not hesitate to sacrifice their lives to achieve it. That evening, a large-scale attack on the paratrooper station occurred.

### Watching American Veterans in the Streets of New York (Part 2)

— Special Correspondent for Ding Bao in the United States, Mao Shuqing

I asked a newly acquainted friend in the city government if New York was short of housing because the soldiers had all returned. He said, "It has something to do with it, but not entirely. Most of the veterans are sent back to their hometowns according to their original addresses," and didn't stay in New York. "And some of them have entered universities across the country"!

According to the American soldiers' rights petition, the government has a responsibility to fulfill the wishes of soldiers who volunteer to pursue further education after being discharged. As a result, universities across the United States are now experiencing problems with too many students and insufficient capacity. Near Columbia University in New York, you can still see college students in military uniforms carrying books walking around, and many are living in on-campus dormitories. Ohio State University recently admitted two hundred disabled honorably discharged soldiers, who live in the army hospital and go to school on time during the day. One of them even had both legs broken. They can't go to physical training or participate in various school activities. The New York Times recently issued a call, believing that the massive influx of soldiers into schools would increase the difficulty of educational administration, and urged the demobilization authorities to find ways to improve the situation.

Demobilizing more than ten million soldiers is not an easy task. General Brett Law, who had traveled through Europe, was appointed head of the demobilization effort and is vigorously removing all obstacles. Looking at the general situation in New York, very few veterans are wandering around unemployed. During my journey on the Atlantic ship, I participated in the entertainment of their officers and soldiers. The demobilization authorities used films to issue notices on how to fill out volunteer forms, distribute or introduce jobs. The U.S. government has made a firm determination to do this, believing that if this matter is not handled well, it will be a collective shame for the country.

In the United States, unemployment and labor strikes are two different things. If the unemployment problem becomes serious, it will lead to social unrest. Although worker strikes can also reduce production, in a country with highly developed capitalism, "labor strikes" are common, especially after a war has just ended. Many mines in the United States worked five hours a day before the war and increased production to eight hours during the war, with wages naturally increasing as well. Now that the war is over, they have to return to five hours of work a day, and the workers hope not to reduce wages or even increase wages, because general prices have increased compared to the past. Most of the mine owners agree to increase wages, but the differences between them have become the source of labor strikes. At the same time, American labor strikes are by no means riots. They have democratic training, strong collective organizations, and the most powerful ones, such as the National Federation of Labor C.I.O., etc. Recently, the chairman of the labor union, Lewis, gave a speech to workers in Washington, particularly criticizing the "politicization" of labor unions. He said that American labor unions have no political party affiliation and will never be the tail of any political party. "Some people regard us as sponsors of the Communist Party, which is a big mistake."

Recently, the American coal mine labor strike is unfolding. Four hundred thousand "soft coal" workers in the states of Virginia, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and Kansas have stopped working, waiting for their labor union to negotiate with the authorities. Negotiations are being held in Washington, and the demands of the Coal Workers Union are: (1) Increase mine safety equipment; (2) Mine owners should allocate one cent per ton of coal to a worker welfare fund; (3) The fifty-four-hour work week should be changed to thirty-five hours without reducing salaries. After the demands were made, the government dispatched Paul Ford to serve as an arbitrator. The capitalists believe that the first point can be improved at any time by hiring top-notch engineers and technical experts for inspection and improvement. If the second point is implemented, the capitalists will lose $60 million annually, which is too much. The third point, working hours, can be considered.

Coal is a daily necessity and a major fuel for heavy industry. Therefore, the stagnation of coal production will affect the whole situation. According to estimates by the New York Times, the current coal reserves in New York and nearby areas are sufficient for four to six weeks, but the impact on the steel industry is significant. The largest steel company in Pittsburgh is preparing to reduce its production by 47% to cope with the fuel shortage.

I use the coal mine situation as an example to illustrate that many light and heavy industries in the United States are now out of sync in the transition from war to peace. This is an inevitable phenomenon. It is by no means an easy task for such a large country to mobilize more than ten million people and tens of millions of tons of materials to fight in the Pacific and Europe. What may be even more unbelievable is that butter and white sugar are still not available in New York City. In the American military camps in various parts of Europe, I saw mountains of butter shipped from the United States. However, when you get to New York and eat at a restaurant, there is no butter. "Americans are not just a nation that knows how to enjoy themselves." They have sacrificed everything for the war.

Of course, no matter how you look at it, Americans are still the happiest group in the world. They jump, shout, and make noise without worry or trouble. Especially in New York, the five largest cinemas, music halls, the National Theater, and Roxy Theater are filled with tens of thousands of people every day, from early morning to late at night. On Saturdays and Sundays, they are even open twenty-four hours a day. When a new film from Hollywood comes to New York, you have to queue up to buy tickets. For a little over a dollar, you can watch a movie and a song and dance show. It seems that these millions of New Yorkers spend more time playing and less time working. This kind of enjoyment cannot be seen or found in Europe. Once, the Roxy Theater was showing a newsreel, and the former New York Mayor LaGuardia was serving as the director of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. When his picture appeared, the "New Yorkers" in the audience laughed. Every time LaGuardia gave his inaugural speech, the audience would burst into laughter, just like middle school students watching their homeroom teacher perform on stage. LaGuardia had been the parent of their seven million people and had also been their homeroom teacher. Who says democratic politics are not lovely? The loveliness of democratic politics lies here. (The End) (Mailed on April 10)

### Electing the Wise and Capable, Participating Enthusiastically - Commander Shen Prudently Handles Affairs, Legal Election - Mayor Qian Broadcasts on the Eve of the Election

Mayor Qian Dajun delivered a broadcast speech last night, expressing three points of expectation for this election to the people of all walks of life in the city: (1) To be a citizen of a democratic country, the first condition is to be enthusiastic about politics, and the main manifestation of enthusiasm for politics is to actively participate in elections. Participation in elections is a duty that every citizen should fulfill, at least a basic duty. Only when every citizen is happy to assume this duty can we become a truly democratic country. (2) When we participate in elections, we should not just casually cast a vote and be done with it. We should carefully consider the candidates before writing their names. The ancients said that "the great way prevails" depends on "electing the wise and appointing the capable." The wise are those with morality, and the capable are those with ability. Only those who possess both morality and ability are worthy of being our representatives. Election is both a duty and a right. We should not give up this right, nor should we use this right casually. (3) Democratic politics and the law have an inseparable relationship. Without the rule of law, we cannot have democracy. During the election, everyone should compete enthusiastically, but all actions must be legal, and there must be no actions outside the law. Using methods outside the law to compete will not only be subject to legal sanctions, but will also have no effect. Even if one is fortunate enough to be elected, it is a dishonorable victory, an inglorious victory. On the eve of this election, I hope for the efforts of fellow compatriots from all walks of life, and at the same time, I wish our first municipal councilor election a complete success.

### The Jiang Gongmei Case is Expected to Be Sentenced in Three Days - Martial Law Not Yet Lifted - Commander Li Attends Press Conference to Report

[Our Newspaper's Report] Li Jilan, Commander of the Songhu Garrison Command, attended a press conference at the Municipal Government Information Office yesterday afternoon to report on and answer questions regarding the city's public security. Regarding the reasons why the curfew has not been lifted, Commander Li stated that the military force is not yet fully equipped, transportation has not yet been restored, and theft cases in the city are emerging one after another. For the sake of the safety of the lives and property of the entire citizenry, it cannot be lifted for the time being, especially since May is a time of many incidents, and prevention should be strengthened. However, various conveniences have been provided for the night work of a few people.

Jiang Gongyi was arrested by the Garrison Command on October 13 of last year. The entire case was handed over to the Chongqing Military Police Headquarters. After consulting the Supreme Standing Committee of the Military Affairs Commission, the Garrison Command was ordered to try the case. The command and the Army Headquarters and the Military Police Headquarters immediately sent personnel to jointly hear the case. After the trial was completed, the presiding officer, Li Shenzhi, a senior advisor to the Army Headquarters, declared Jiang not guilty. All sectors of society and Commander Qian considered this verdict inappropriate, so they requested instructions from the authorities again and were ordered to review the case and return the prisoner. The case is expected to be decided in three days, and the Military Affairs Commission will still be requested to review it after the verdict is announced.

Commander Li stated that he would do his best to deal with the occasional theft cases and military robberies in this city, and would impose severe penalties upon confirmation. However, it is inevitable that some people impersonate soldiers to undermine the central government and blame central government agencies through conspiratorial means, causing citizens to become suspicious; and that deserters and miscellaneous soldiers endanger local public security, and will be severely punished according to law when found. Military police stationed in houses in the Hongkou area can be reported and punished if they waste residents' water and electricity, thereby increasing the burden.

In the case of Japanese national Yutaka Tsuchida, an order was received from the central government that he must be severely punished because he was related to Murakami, a secretary of the Japanese intelligence department. Tsuchida was the mastermind behind Murakami's activities. After interrogation by the Garrison Command, he was handed over to the military court for war crimes processing. The Songhu Garrison Command is the highest military justice organ in Songhu and has the power to arrest war criminals. No other agency may interfere except the central government.

### After the Livestock Market Closed - The Problem of Employees Not Resolved

[Our Newspaper's Report] After the livestock market in this city was ordered to close, all employees formed a post-liquidation committee and petitioned the municipal government and the Social Affairs Bureau. Yesterday, they also hosted reporters from various newspapers at the Kesilin Pharmacy to report on the process and said they hoped that the market would provide reasonable arrangements to ensure their future.

### Public Trial of Two Officials - Xie Zhongfu and Gong Were Driven By Life - Xu Jidun Said He Helped the War of Resistance

[Our Newspaper's Report] Xie Zhongfu and Xu Jidun were interrogated yesterday morning at the High Court by Judge Qiu Huan-ying. The former defendant was short and fat, with a crew cut, wearing a blue cloth robe; the latter was lanky, with hair, wearing a striped cloth robe. Their families all hired lawyers to defend them.

Xie Zhongfu

Testified: 49 years old, from Meixian County, Guangdong Province. Before 1936, he served as a member of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. He resigned in the second half of 1936. He joined the puppet organization in April 1940. He was introduced by Chu Minyi to serve as a standing member of the Puppet Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. The chairman was Chen Jicheng. However, at that time, the puppet decrees could not leave the country, so the association basically had nothing to do. Meetings were rarely held, and when they were held, they only discussed personnel matters. Therefore, this position was equivalent to holding a position without doing any work. In February 1943, the association was abolished at the same time as the Puppet Frontier Committee. In August 1944, he was transferred to the position of Puppet Administrative Inspector, which also had no practical work. Moreover, the work of "cleaning up the countryside" had already come to an end, so he did not hear about it in advance. In May 1945, he went to Zhejiang with Ding Mocun to serve as the Puppet Minister of Education, but he only served for three months before the victory. The defendant has never made any speeches, broadcasts, articles, or communications with overseas countries during his tenure in various puppet positions. He took up puppet positions because he was in economic difficulty at the time, with an elderly father and seven or eight family members to support, and was driven by life. Now that he is imprisoned, his blood pressure is very high and he suffers from hearing loss, so he asked the court to investigate and declare him not guilty. Tears were in his eyes as he spoke, and he was unable to finish his words in grief.

Xu Jidun

50 years old, from Gaoyou. According to his testimony: He worked at the Provincial Yangzhou Middle School 28 years ago. Later, he was arrested by "76" for preparing to publish a publication with the subordinates of Ma Yuanfang, then Director of the Jiangsu Education Department, and was coerced into joining the puppet organization. However, the Puppet General Education Department was an agency exclusively in charge of primary and secondary school education. The preparation of textbooks was handled by a separate editorial office. The defendant once suggested to Zhao Zhengping, the then Puppet Minister of Education, that the changes in the school system during the Renovation Government era, the employment of Japanese consultants, the failure to teach the Three Principles of the People, and the failure to hang a portrait of Sun Yat-sen, and the change of the citizenship course to a moral education course should be corrected. Regarding the addition of Japanese language instruction, it was agreed at the time that "primary schools should not teach foreign languages" in principle. During his tenure as Minister of Education in Zhejiang, the work of "cleaning up the countryside" was a mere formality and was actually a political tool. As the Puppet Director of Construction in Shanghai, water and electricity were managed by the enemy China Water and Electricity Company, so there was nothing else to do other than vehicle registration. The defendant worked hard to reduce illiteracy, stabilize the lives of teachers, restore schools, and protect teachers and students traveling to the rear, all of which were beneficial to the people, which can be investigated by the court. During the trial, Judge Qiu suddenly asked the defendant whether he approved of the Nanjing government. Xu was stunned for a long time and could not speak fluently. Finally, he replied: On the surface, it seems that they all have some reason, but I dare not judge whether it is merit or demerit. And my intention to participate was only to do something to indirectly help the War of Resistance. The court argued the above two cases and adjourned for another hearing, and the defendants were returned to custody.

### Three Major Obstacles to Chinese Tea Exports - Costs are Too High and No One Will Ask - Must Be Jointly Operated with Collective Power

[Our Newspaper's Report] Shou Yicheng, chairman of the China Tea Association, told reporters: There are currently three major obstacles to Chinese tea export trade: (1) The price issue. Currently, tea farmers calculate tea prices based on rice prices. If grain prices are high and tea prices are low, tea farmers will not pick tea leaves because there is no profit. Therefore, rice prices and tea prices are implicitly linked. (2) The freight issue. Domestic transportation is difficult, and freight rates are high. (3) The interest rate issue. Currently, domestic interest rates are high. Even for the tea loans in the Southeast tea-producing areas that were recently established, the monthly interest rate is four and a half points, plus a handling fee of one and a half points, for a total monthly interest rate of six points. Before the war, tea loans were only 7% to 8% per year. In the recent situation in Japan, the annual interest rate is only 2%. This time, tea loans in Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces totaled 7 billion yuan. This is of great importance to the restoration of the rural economy after the war. According to the planned plan, this year PingShui area in Zhejiang Province can produce 160,000 boxes of tea; Suichun area can produce 35,000 boxes of tea; Wenzhou area can produce 20,000 boxes of tea. Tunxi area in Anhui Province can produce 120,000 boxes of tea; Qimen area can produce 75,000 boxes of tea. Ningzhou area in Jiangxi Province can produce 40,000 boxes of tea, and Gandong area can produce 10,000 boxes of tea. In addition, Fujian Province can produce about 140,000 boxes of tea; Hunan and Hubei provinces can produce about 300,000 boxes of tea; the total is about 900,000 boxes. However, now that there is production, it is necessary to further prepare for its export steps. Judging from the current world tea production and sales situation, Japan's tea production has decreased by 50% compared to before the war due to the impact of the war, while China's has decreased by only 30%, which is a good opportunity to catch up quickly. Moreover, the United States originally had a commercial agreement with the United Kingdom to purchase tea from India and Ceylon, but it has now announced that it will not renew it. Therefore, Americans deeply hope to buy more Chinese tea. Moreover, during this war, more than 6 million American soldiers have traveled to China, India, and the Philippines. This group of soldiers is accustomed to drinking tea due to the lack of coffee drinks. After returning to the United States, they praised the beauty of Chinese tea and promoted our Chinese black and green tea as a free advertisement. Therefore, our Chinese black and green tea does not have to worry about a sales market in the United States. However, in the past, China's largest market for green tea was North Africa, the largest market for Qimen black tea was the British Isles, and tea bricks were mostly sold to the Soviet Union. In the early days of the War of Resistance, 70% of Chinese tea was transported to Russia for barter. Therefore, the export should have a precise plan and tidy steps to seek long-term development. Reducing production costs is the most important thing. For example, the US market price of Qimen black tea is only 50 cents per pound. Although it has recently risen to 57 cents, the cost of selling Chinese Qimen black tea to the United States is at least about one US dollar per pound, a difference of up to one time. Therefore, even if countries are willing to purchase it, it will be difficult for people to ask because of the high price. Mr. Shou believes that to reduce production costs, first, domestic tea merchants must unite and organize the China Tea Export Trading Corporation. Using collective power, the same steps, and joint operations, concentrate transportation and sales. On the one hand, recruit experts and purchase new machines, use scientific methods, establish experimental farms and refined tea factories to mass-produce fine tea. On the other hand, I hope the government will have an unwavering national policy for the tea industry across the country, so that tea merchants and tea farmers have something to follow in terms of production and sales, and move towards a sound and planned production path.

### Effective May 1st, Telephone Progressive Billing Introduced, Hoping Citizens Will Use Restraint

The American Shanghai Telephone Company, due to equipment limitations, has not only been unable to universally supply telephone installations to citizens, but its daily connections are also experiencing delays due to traffic congestion. Recognizing this, the Public Utilities Bureau has repeatedly instructed improvements, on one hand urging the company to make appropriate adjustments to existing equipment, and on the other hand, urging it to quickly order equipment from the United States for expansion. It is reported that equipment sufficient for 10,000 user lines is already on order. However, in the current global environment of material scarcity, the completion of this plan within a short period is unlikely. Currently, the company's users are using the telephone exceptionally frequently, with an average of 10.6 calls per line per day, exceeding the machine capacity by 40%. During the period when expansion equipment cannot be realized, the company has requested the adoption of a progressive billing system to improve connection speed. After careful study by the Public Utilities Bureau, considering the company's revenue and expenditure situation, based on the normal needs of users, and taking into account the burden on the general public, the progressive method has been approved and submitted to the Municipal Government for approval, and will be implemented from May 1st. The basic telephone fee will only increase by 70% to 100%, and the excess over the basic number of calls will be charged progressively, with each 100 calls as a level. The charges are as follows: monthly calls below 100 will be charged at 25 yuan per call; 101 to 200 calls at 50 yuan per call; 201 to 300 calls at 100 yuan per call; 301 to 400 calls at 150 yuan per call; and over 400 calls at 200 yuan per call. It is hoped that citizens will reduce unnecessary calls to reduce the burden on the equipment, so that traffic can be expected to be smooth, and there may be a surplus to provide for the normal application of citizens. In this way, the efficiency of the telephone service will gradually improve.

### Six Robberies in Less Than Two Months, Four Arch-Robbers Sentenced to Death, Executed by Firing Squad Yesterday on Song Park Road

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The four arch-robbers Cai Defang, Gao Hongfei, Ji Amao, and Lu Xiankang, etc., after being captured by the police in the Haidongchun Inn on Guangxi Road, were sent to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters Military Law Office for interrogation. They confessed to armed robberies at the following locations: (1) No. 5 Huashengfang, Jinmen Street, at 7:00 PM on January 18th; (2) No. 2 Chongqing Road, Tongyuan Pawnshop, at 3:00 AM on February 10th; (3) No. 319, Lane 568, Xinzha Road, at 10:00 AM on the 17th of the same month; (4) No. 1, Lane 199, Chongde Road, at 7:00 PM on the 27th of the same month; (5) No. 10, Lane 28, South Sichuan Road, at 5:00 PM on March 9th; (6) The home of Wang Ronglin, No. 69, Lane 69, Anfu Road, at 4:30 PM on the 12th of the same month. After summoning the victims to court for identification, the court considered that the criminals dared to commit six consecutive armed robberies in 53 days, which was extremely heinous. According to the Regulations on the Punishment of Bandits, they were sentenced to death. The sentence was approved by the superiors and executed by firing squad at 10:00 AM yesterday on Song Park Road.

### City Hospital Association Discusses Salary Issues

### Six-Year-Old Girl Dies of Illness, Doctor Huang Nan Accused

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Cao Miaoying, a six-year-old girl from Xuzhou, was the only daughter of Cao Xuewen, the general affairs officer of the Changshu Road Police Station. She fell ill on the 25th of last month and was sent to Nanyang Hospital on Jinling West Road on the 28th, where she was diagnosed and treated by Dr. Huang Nan of the pediatrics department. An X-ray was immediately taken, and it was said that she might have typhoid fever, so she was ordered to be hospitalized. Blood was drawn as many as 14 times, but there was no improvement. On the 11th of this month, another X-ray was taken, and it was said to be tuberculosis. Later, Cao took her to Feng Zijun, a tuberculosis expert, for treatment. Feng said it was too late and that there would have been no problem if she had come a week earlier. Cao's child died at Nanyang Hospital on the morning of the 22nd. Cao Xuewen believes that his beloved daughter died unjustly. In addition to requesting the court to examine the body, he filed a complaint with the District Prosecutor's Office on the 23rd of this month against Huang Nan.

### The Dike of Jiangyin, Changshu, and Nantong is in Danger, Fellow Townsmen in Shanghai Plan Rescue

Changyinsha, under the jurisdiction of Jiangyin, Changshu, and Nantong counties, faces the Yangtze River. It has been occupied for eight years, and the seawall project has suffered considerable damage. At this time of rising spring water and approaching summer tides, the area along the river is in danger of submergence, and tens of thousands of victims are terrified all day long. Therefore, representatives were sent to Shanghai a few days ago to appeal to all sectors for relief. The fellow townsmen from the three counties in Shanghai initiated the organization of the Jiangchangtong Seawall Engineering Committee to plan rescue efforts. The inaugural meeting was held at the Atlantic Vegetable Society. Ji Chen Shi Quan, Feng Youju, Wu Shouying, and other nine people were elected as executive members to preside over the affairs and actively proceed. According to experts, the entire project requires as much as 3.5 billion yuan.

### Glimpses from an Aerial Tour: A Brief Stop on West Lake

— Our Reporter, Mai Tian, Shou Mu

I remember that before the War of Resistance, the Eurasia Aviation Corporation once invited the press to take a city flight, but it was never as grand and exciting as yesterday's invitation from the Central Air Transport Corporation—taking us from Shanghai through Taihu Lake to West Lake, and then back from West Lake. This aerial trip, especially in the late spring season, with a vast expanse of spring scenery in the south of the Yangtze River, is truly captivating.

At 8:30 yesterday morning, the reporter arrived in front of the Municipal Government, ready to wait for the airline's truck to take me to the airport. I thought there was another group petitioning. As a result, I saw that the big crowd of people were all planning to "fly." Each signed reporter could also bring a friend, so it's no wonder everyone was scrambling for the opportunity. The gentleman issuing the tickets was running east and west, jumping up and down, covered in sweat. It took three hours to issue all the tickets.

One hundred and several dozen people were divided into three batches to tour. The first batch of people, at 9:40, took the company's 19th C46 type straw-yellow transport plane, which can carry six tons, and departed from Longhua. Chen Wenkuan, the head of the flight crew, personally piloted the plane. Next to him sat a foreign assistant who could speak fluent Mandarin. Mr. Chen's piloting skills are very high. It is said that when he was fighting in the Myanmar area, he transported military supplies and materials, making as many as six round trips every day. This kind of hard and enduring work is not easy.

After the plane took off, it circled the city once and then flew along the Jinghu Line. It took only 20 minutes to reach Taihu Lake. From Taihu Lake to West Lake, the weather turned bad, so the fuselage vibrated, sometimes high and sometimes low. Many of the passengers vomited. After flying in the clouds for about 15 minutes, the fuselage slowly descended. At this time, we had reached the sky above West Lake, and we vaguely admired the beauty of West Lake, which was not in vain for this trip.

The first batch returned to Shanghai at 11:20. Ten minutes later, the second batch took off on the same plane, but this time they were at a disadvantage, as they could only fly a circle near Shanghai. But from inside the plane, overlooking this largest city in the East, the paddy fields were clearly visible and very beautiful. The buildings were arranged as if they were very orderly, and the green fields in the wilderness were even more beautiful and lovely. The large warships in the Huangpu River had become shoes at this time; the trains moved no differently than earthworms on the ground. Oxygen was provided in the plane, and after flying for 40 minutes, everyone gradually got hot. Several guests couldn't stand it anymore, and it was time to rest after returning.

The enthusiasm of the third batch of people did not diminish. It was almost time for lunch, but they still wanted to go up. So they changed to another plane. After everyone's unanimous request, the pilot was unwilling to spoil the fun, and finally circled above Hangzhou and brought everyone back when it was past 2 o'clock.

### Death of Mr. Chen Taoyi, Promoting Revolution for Decades as One Day, Steadfastly Serving the Local Area

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Mr. Chen Taoyi of Jinshan [see picture], aged 66, passed away at 11:30 AM yesterday at his residence, No. 12 Zelin Place, Hed Road, Shanghai. When the news of his death spread, all of Mr. Chen's friends mourned in unison. The funeral is now scheduled for 4:00 PM tomorrow at the World Funeral Home. Mr. Chen was a talented scholar in the late Qing Dynasty. When the revolutionary wind arose, he sold his family property and went to Waseda University in Japan to study political economy, and joined the Tongmenghui. Soon after the assassination group was established, Mr. Chen served as the deputy leader and was dispatched back to China to work. Due to the secrecy of the matter, when the ship arrived at the Wusongkou, he was ordered by Liangjiang Governor Duanfang to be detained and sent to Beijing by the Shanghai Daotai. Fortunately, he was released a year before the Xinhai Revolution after Zhang Sai's strong guarantee. He then went to various parts of Southeast Asia to promote the revolution, and served as the Jiangsu Branch President of the Kuomintang. During the presidential election, he served as the Jiangsu representative and the vice chairman of the Provisional Senate. After the failure of the Second Revolution, he withdrew from party and government affairs and went to the three northeastern provinces to organize the Dongjing Company to engage in land reclamation. When Sun Chuanfang served as the governor of five provinces, he was shocked by Mr. Chen's prestige and repeatedly invited him to become the head of Jiangsu Province. During the Northern Expedition, Zhang Qun, the current chairman of Sichuan Province, was ordered to contact Mr. Chen to persuade Sun to revolt, but due to the obstruction of the chief of staff, the purpose was not achieved. Mr. Chen also took this opportunity to retire and return to his countryside. Chen Min and the late owner of this newspaper, Mr. Shi Liangcai, were close friends, so he did his best for this newspaper. Later, when Mr. Shi became the head of the local association in this city, Mr. Chen served as the secretary-general. During the period when this city was occupied, the rebels also invited him several times to become afraid of Jiangsu Province, but he declined on the grounds of illness. Mr. Chen often said to his sons, Duanbai and Xiubai: "I only wish to have a clean body, wealth and honor are not what we seek." Mr. Chen contracted tuberculosis ten years ago, but gradually recovered with the careful treatment of his eldest son. Two years ago, he contracted bronchiectasis, which caused persistent asthma. Recently, his heart weakened and his blood circulation was also abnormal. From the 15th of this month, his breathing was short, and his blood pressure dropped and his blood vessels bled the day before yesterday. He passed away suddenly at 11:30 AM yesterday.

### Three Traitors Sentenced to Imprisonment, Four Cases Debate Concluded

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Zhang Suxing, who once served as the head of the puppet anti-smoking bureau, was sentenced by the High Court yesterday. The main text: Conspiring with enemy countries, plotting to rebel against one's own country, sentenced to three years of imprisonment, deprivation of public rights for three years. Also, the cases of Xu Jichuan and Xu Yuanlai, suspected of being traitors, were also adjudicated. Xu Jichuan was sentenced to three years of imprisonment, deprivation of public rights for three years, and Xu Yuanlai was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment, deprivation of public rights for two years. All the property of the above defendants will be confiscated, except for the necessary living expenses for their families. On the same day, the collegiate panel concluded the debate on four cases, namely (1) the Hong Ting case, (2) the Zhu Jiutian case, and (3) the Gu Yousheng case, all scheduled for sentencing on the 30th. (4) The Deng Xiugao and Deng Dingquan case is scheduled for sentencing on May 3rd.

Also, Lin Kangsi, one of the "Three Elders", was interrogated by the High Procuratorate yesterday. Among those questioned on the same day were Sun Shaokang, Zhang Guangdou, and Wang Zhisan, among others.

### Two People Killed by Cars, Minister Zhu's Car Causes Accident, Drunk American Soldier Causes Trouble Again

[Reported by Our Newspaper] At about 9:00 AM yesterday, a 20-year-old pedestrian was hit by a car on Henan Road, suffering a head injury. He was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment by the police, but died at noon. According to sources, the car belongs to Minister of Education Zhu.

[Reported by Our Newspaper] At the intersection of Aidaiming Road and Yuanfang Road, at 8:30 PM last night, an American-style small jeep carrying four American soldiers, all excessively drunk, was shouting along the way. At that time, there was a heavy rain, and many people were waiting at the tram station. Unexpectedly, the American soldiers driving the car did not follow the road and crashed into the crowd. One person was knocked down and killed, and the jeep sped away.

### Shangxian Women and Children's Hospital Actively Resumes Operations

Shangxian Women and Children's Hospital has been serving general poor women and children for 20 years, with outstanding achievements. It has been renting the building at No. 11 Dumei Road as the hospital site. However, after the victory of the War of Resistance, the owner took back the building, so it had to move out. But due to the large number of patients, the diagnosis and treatment work could not be suspended, so an outpatient department was still set up at No. 12 Yingshi Road, and hospitalized patients were temporarily housed in Renhe Hospital. Later, the Christian Hongde Church was willing to lend its church building to the hospital. Unfortunately, the repair costs were too high, so it could not become a reality. Now, Mr. Ward, a British man, is willing to rent several buildings along the road on Tanggu Road, which he owns, to the hospital unconditionally, which is admirable. It is reported that the hospital's board of directors will actively raise funds to repair them so that the hospital can resume operations as soon as possible.

### Facing Internal and External Situations Alone: Truman's Heavy Responsibilities and Power

"A former President of the United States will never congratulate a friend who is elected President!"

This was said by John Adams, the second President of the United States of North America, when his son, Quincy Adams, was also elected President. This happened more than a hundred years ago. From then until the 20th century, the position of President of the United States has consistently been one of the most burdensome and responsible positions in the world.

Truman - A Recent Portrait

Unparalleled Power and Responsibility

The United States, a powerful nation with a population of 140 million, places the ultimate responsibility for its actions on the shoulders of the President. The President also bears the final responsibility for the United States' relations with other countries. He (the President) is the head of the government, with the power to lead his party and resolve domestic crises and disputes. He is responsible for handling foreign affairs, meaning that international matters are decided by him. He has the power to appoint officials of all ranks. His ability to fulfill these significant missions relies entirely on the presidential authority he possesses, which is rarely granted to heads of state in other countries.

Struggling to Manage: Extremely Difficult

In fact, the US President is not solely responsible for his actions. His actions only need to be passed by either the Senate or the House of Representatives to become legally binding. This is the opposite of other republican countries and can be said to be different. In American history, there have been several presidents who faced a situation where the Senate and House of Representatives were filled with seats held by the opposition party. In other words, the president had to manage government affairs and rule the country under the constraints of the two houses, which were in an adversarial position. For example, President Roosevelt (Note: There were two Roosevelts in American history, from the same family, but separate in time. The older Roosevelt was named Theodore Roosevelt. Here, we are talking about Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was elected for four terms and made great achievements for world peace and human happiness. When the United States first became independent, its second president, Washington, stipulated that presidents could not serve more than two consecutive terms. This was a good traditional practice to prevent dictatorship and adhere to democratic principles. President Roosevelt's multiple consecutive terms were entirely an exception in American history, thus fully demonstrating his achievements and popularity.) and President Hoover before him were examples. President Hoover was a Republican, and within two years of his presidency, the majority of seats in the Senate and House of Representatives belonged to the Democratic Party. He had to struggle to manage the situation with the two houses, which had a majority of opposing factions. Was the situation not quite thorny?

Removed from Office Due to Impeachment

The US President can be removed from office through "impeachment." "Impeachment" is a process initiated by members of the House of Representatives for accusations of treason, bribery, and other serious crimes. The Senate, according to the powers conferred by the Constitution, has the right to put the impeachment cases brought by the House of Representatives to a vote, but it must be agreed to by a two-thirds majority of all members for a disciplinary or removal case to be established. However, this impeachment procedure has only been used once in American history, in 1868, when Johnson was President. Johnson was removed from office midway due to impeachment by the Senate and House of Representatives. He did not commit crimes such as treason or bribery. The reason for his removal was that he dismissed the Secretary of War without the consent of the Senate.

Ten Secretaries: Seemingly Supporting Roles

One of the most important presidential powers is his veto power. He has the power to veto laws initiated by the US Congress, which means he can express disapproval, disagreement, and refuse to pass them into law. After the president's veto, the two houses must re-vote with a two-thirds majority for the law to be legally established. There are ten secretaries who help the president handle government affairs, and they are collectively appointed as his cabinet, acting like his supporting team. The names of the ten departments are: Department of State (roughly equivalent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in other countries, but with much greater responsibilities and powers, hence the name "Department"; the head is called the Secretary of State, which is also included in the ten departments here), Department of the Treasury, Department of War, Department of Justice, Post Office Department, Department of the Navy, Department of the Interior, Department of Agriculture, Department of Commerce, and Department of Labor.

Annual Income of Three Thousand: Not as Good as a Merchant

The term of office is four years, and the salary is $75,000 per year. Several past presidents have been heavily indebted during their terms. Once, President Roosevelt's press secretary, Daniels, estimated the president's personal income and said: After paying all income taxes and all expenses in the White House, the president and his family can only receive $3,000 per year! Nevertheless, the position of President is still a high-ranking position that American politicians desperately strive for! The American President is not produced by direct election. The election method is as follows: Each state's Democratic and Republican parties (in fact, only these two major parties hold power in the United States. The presidents of all previous terms have been candidates from these two parties. Although other parties have emerged during and after the war, they have had little impact) have the same number of electors as the number of seats they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives. The electors of both parties must collectively nominate the party's presidential candidate. The candidate who receives the most votes is elected President. Under this system, if the opposing candidate wins the majority of votes in each state election, a candidate who receives the most votes in a direct election may be defeated by the opponent. This has a mathematical possibility.

Youthful Thirty-Five: Can Become President

In most countries, the president is selected from the Congress or Parliament. However, the American President is not produced in this way, so there is another dangerous possibility. That is, the elected president may not necessarily be someone with abundant political experience. Wilkie, who lost the presidential election in 1940, may be a clear example. Wilkie had never held public office before participating in the presidential election. To give another example, if a military person is elected president, then, apart from the experience gained in the military, there may not be much other significant experience? These are the criticisms of a French journalist. Candidates must be at least thirty-five years old to participate in the election, and they must also have been raised in the United States and resided in the United States for at least fourteen years. As mentioned above, before Roosevelt, American presidents could only serve a maximum of one consecutive term. Roosevelt not only served two terms, but from 1944, he simply served three consecutive terms, making a total of four terms as President. It can be said to be "unprecedented," and perhaps even "unsurpassed"!

Facing the World Alone

After President Roosevelt passed away in April 1945, Vice President Truman was the natural successor according to the American Constitution. There is a clause in the American Constitution that states: "In the event of the death or vacancy of the President, the Vice President shall succeed him. If the Vice President is also vacant, the cabinet secretaries, starting with the Secretary of State, shall succeed the Vice President." The main task of the Vice President is to serve as the President of the Senate. The Vice President's election campaign is usually held before the presidential election. At the same time, the Vice President is often elected for political reasons. If the Vice President succeeds as President, there is no Vice President's position in the country until the next presidential election. So, the current President Truman does not have a Vice President, isn't it like facing the complex and diverse world situation alone? (Youqin)

### Public Trial of the Traitor Lü Yiwen, Former Minister to Germany of the Puppet Manchukuo Government

— Special Correspondent Zhang Shengli from Kunming, Reported by Airmail on the 21st of This Month

Browsing through the confessions of traitors published in various newspapers recently, the traitor who claimed to be stateless is perhaps Lü Yiwen. Lü Yiwen once served as the Chief Secretary to the Prime Minister, Director of the Commerce Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the first Governor of Tonghua Province, and the first Minister to Germany under the "Kangde Emperor" of the puppet Manchukuo. Such a traitor with a not-so-small false title and a considerable demeanor was publicly tried in the prosperous and peaceful Kunming, which naturally aroused the attention of the general public.

Lecturing to the Judge: Expressing "Patriotic with a Curve"

At 2:00 PM on April 20, the front yard of the Yunnan Provincial High Court disappeared its usual state of neglect. Citizens jostled and crowded into the Criminal Court, scrambling to be the first. Latecomers climbed onto the window sills with justification, tearing up the window paper, all eager to catch a glimpse of the traitor's face. Lü Yiwen was wearing a gray tweed suit, gold-rimmed glasses, and German-style leather shoes. He had slightly graying hair with a layer of hair oil on it. When he was escorted to the court, the audience whispered, "Look at that Ren-Dan-style mustache, it's a symbol of a traitor!"

Judge Han Yunguo first questioned Lü Yiwen's place of origin. Lü Yiwen confessed, "I am from Jin County, Guandong, but I do not have Chinese nationality, because after the Sino-Japanese War, the Chinese in the Liaodong Peninsula lost their nationality." The judge then asked about each item in the indictment. Lü Yiwen immediately used skillful and sophistical techniques to explain his "patriotism," "love for the people," and "love for the family," and said, "Yiwen is not good at words and has a bad voice." Sometimes he used gestures to assist his tone, as if lecturing to the calm judge. In addition to expressing "Patriotic with a Curve," he also considered himself a "filial son."

Lü Yiwen Verbose and Evasive: Did Not Implement a Poisoning Policy

According to Lü Yiwen's confession: He was unemployed for two years before the September 18th Incident, and later served as a Japanese translator in the Northeast Aviation Headquarters. When the Northeast Army was transferred into the Guan Nei, his superiors did not allow him to enter, so he went to Dalian. Lü Yiwen pretended to be emotional and said, "At that time, the country was powerless, what could I do?" In March of the 21st year, Lü Yiwen became the Director of the Commerce Department of the puppet Manchukuo. His confession was: "That was a Director in name only, I didn't do anything, because there was no commercial relationship with the international community at all." He also admitted that during his tenure as Director, he did not sign any commercial treaties with Japan, nor did he help the Japanese plunder materials. When the audience heard this, they responded with cold laughter.

Judge Han asked, "Did you implement a poisoning policy in the puppet Manchukuo?" Lü Yiwen narrated: "No, no, I dare say no. The judge can imagine, in the nine counties of Tonghua Province, the people didn't even have enough to eat, how could they afford to smoke drugs? During my tenure as the Governor of Tonghua Province, the Governor-General of Korea ordered the purchase of land for immigration, and I opposed it to the death, causing dissatisfaction among the Japanese. As for conscripting young men, that was after Yiwen went to Germany. Yiwen said to the judge, please ask the judge to investigate in the Northeast, it is best to transfer this case to the Northeast Court for trial. If there are these things, Yiwen will commit suicide."

Shaking His Head and Waggling His Tail in Sophistry: Piling Up Beautiful Words

At this time, Lü Yiwen sophistically shook his head and wagged his tail, saying things like "relieving refugees, lending seeds," and "compassion for the world, saving the people from fire and water." A series of beautiful words made the audience feel jarring. But his "great achievements" were not limited to this. He said, "One million people in Jinzhou relied on him desperately fighting with the puppet Manchukuo to survive." At this point, he gave another example, further explaining: "The Northeast is like skin, Jinzhou is like hair. If Yiwen does not save the Northeast, where will the hair be attached?" "For example: The prostitutes in Jinzhou have never received a Japanese person." Finally, he ended the Northeast part of his confession with an expression of overwhelming emotion: "The war of resistance has now been won. After the invasion of the Russian and Japanese empires, Jinzhou has returned to the motherland, and Yiwen is willing to die!"

Met with Hitler: Afraid of Seeing Ambassador Chen Jie

In the 27th year, Germany recognized the puppet Manchukuo and exchanged envoys. Lü Yiwen then served as the Minister to Germany. According to his confession: He asked to resign because he didn't know German, but it was not approved, so he set off from Dalian on November 1 of that year. On the 21st of that month, he presented his credentials to the German government. He met with Hitler and also met with our country's Ambassador to Germany, Chen Jie, at a tea party, but he was too embarrassed to talk to Ambassador Chen. When the judge asked about the personnel organization and work of the embassy, Lü Yiwen said: There were only two Chinese staff members, and the rest were Japanese. The embassy's intelligence work was to collect European economic and news data, and did not collect military and political intelligence to supply to the puppet Manchukuo. He also said that all his actions were not free, "If I don't act like a scoundrel, they won't let me go?" He then confessed his capture experience, and finally said, "I feel honored to return to the motherland this time. Serving the puppet Manchukuo was due to a misunderstanding." (The simple trial and incessant sophistry continued until 3:40, when Judge Han announced the end of the special investigation court. When Lü Yiwen lowered his head and walked out of the courtroom, an old woman listening in the audience said, "Being a traitor is also a misunderstanding, really strange!")

### The People's "Right to Health": An Item Urgently to Be Added to the Constitution

— Liu Guansheng

In March of this year, the United Kingdom announced the National Health Service Act, under which all hospitals would be nationalized, and all citizens would receive free medical treatment. The purpose of this act is to show the nation's preparedness to fight disease and to uphold the people's "right to health." This is one of the most important social documents of our time. This act, together with the National Insurance Act and the Industrial Injuries Act, forms "the three pillars of the social security edifice that a new Britain is determined to build."

On April 8th of this year, the Chongqing Central Daily News also published the French New Declaration of Human Rights, which is the chapter on the rights of the people in the newly revised draft constitution of the Fourth Republic. Article 22 of that declaration states, "The nation guarantees that all citizens shall be able to benefit from national health and the protection of pregnant women, the development of sports, public health, and various measures derived from science." The preamble to the declaration also contains the sentence, "The French people declare that all human beings have sacred, inalienable rights that cannot be infringed upon by any law, and have decided to list these rights at the forefront of the constitution."

These two consecutive shocking reports, after being heard by us, the Chinese people who nominally rank among the five powers, truly leave us at a loss. Are we to be envious? Or ashamed? Are we to beg? Or to fight for it? Amidst this shock and joy, I would like to briefly express my views for the consideration of the wise and enlightened.

Listing the "right to health" as a fundamental right of the people, equally as important as the rights to body, residence, belief, speech, assembly, and association..., is a product of the progress of social thought in recent years, and also a new discovery of mankind regarding its own status. Because modern thought believes that people have the right to exist, and not only should they exist, but they must exist healthily and happily. If their health cannot be maintained and enhanced, the important meaning of their existence is lost. The first written method of acknowledging that people have the "right to rest" and guaranteeing its implementation by the government, with the establishment of various sanatoriums, medical centers, and other facilities, was stipulated in the Soviet Constitution (Articles 29 and 30 of the Soviet Constitution). This, along with the right to work and the right to education, is praised as a characteristic of the Soviet Constitution, and is also the origin of the "right to health."

Since the Second World War, people of foresight all over the world have further affirmed that "health is the greatest wealth in life" and "the health of the people is the most valuable resource of a country." Therefore, whether speaking from the perspective of the individual or the nation, the maintenance and enhancement of the people's "health" is undoubtedly an important matter, and it is a responsibility that the country cannot shirk. In other words, it is one of the most sacred rights of the people. Therefore, the Atlantic Charter put forward the Four Freedoms, one of which is "freedom from want." In 1943, former US Vice President Wallace, in his speech on the steps to postwar peace, said that "freedom from want" should be the essence of the new declaration of freedom. This freedom can be elaborated into seven items, the third of which is "freedom from unnecessary anxiety, disease, and hunger," which is the United States' first advocacy for "health."

In 1943, US President Roosevelt, in his message to Congress, proposed eight points to define the Second Bill of Rights of the People, the sixth of which was: "The right to obtain adequate medical care and enjoy health," and the seventh was: "The right to obtain adequate security from the fear of old age, illness, accident, and the economic difficulties of unemployment." The fifth point was: "The right of every family to a decent home"; the second point was: "The right to obtain sufficient food, clothing, and recreation." Matters related to clothing, food, housing, and medicine are all listed as rights of the people. Thus, both active and passive rights to health have been proposed.

The nine items of the new declaration of human rights stated in the 1943 general report of the US National Resources Planning Board include: "The fourth item is the right to obtain security, to be free from the terror of old age, hunger, dependency, illness, unemployment, and injury," and the third item is: "The right to obtain adequate clothing, food, living, and medicine."

The above items are all promises made by the US government regarding the rights of the people after the war while the war was still in progress, and also the confirmation by the United States of the "right to health."

As for the UK, before the end of the European war, the Beveridge Report was drafted in 1943, designing a comprehensive social security system. Beveridge said: "The purpose of Britain's war is to defeat dictatorship, and the purpose of its efforts for peace is to defeat the public enemies of the British people—want, disease, unemployment, ignorance, squalor... The solution to disease is public health and food policy..." The method of its implementation is that every person should enjoy the right to free medical treatment. After the end of the war, based on the Beveridge Plan, the formal "National Health Service Act" was formulated in March of this year, and from 1948, all citizens of the country will enjoy the right to free treatment.

Therefore, from the perspective of the major powers such as the UK, the US, France, and the Soviet Union, during several years of arduous warfare, the people have finally pursued a peaceful, happy, and reasonable society, and whether from the perspective of planning, implementation, theory, action, or written and unwritten laws and regulations, it is necessary to affirm the people's "right to health" and to maintain and promote the development of their health.

Our country has long borne the nickname "Sick Man of East Asia," and disease and weakness erode the majority of the people. We have a huge mortality rate of 30%, with more than six million unjustly dead each year. Various acute and chronic infectious diseases are prevalent year-round, parasitic and endemic diseases are widespread, and infant and maternal mortality is high. Environmental sanitation is poor, medical facilities are concentrated in cities, and most people cannot afford medical expenses. As a result, the vast agricultural population has never been exposed to medical care, especially modern scientific medical care, throughout their lives. Even in large cities such as Beiping and Nanjing, pre-war statistics showed that more than 40% of those who fell ill and died had never received any medical treatment (whether Chinese or Western medicine). The situation in other places can be imagined. The war was not a sacrifice in vain. The people of the UK, the US, France, and the Soviet Union are already building their ideal happy paradise and are planning and implementing their promises to ensure the enjoyment of the people's "right to health." Comparing the pre-war health facilities of the UK, the US, France, and the Soviet Union with our country, the difference is truly immeasurable, but as soon as the war stopped, they immediately and urgently tried their best to develop and plan for free and universal supply to all citizens. Shouldn't our people, growing up in such an environment, shout loudly and strive for the "right to health," one of the fundamental human rights?

The National Assembly will be held soon, and the constitution will be formulated soon. In this century of the people, it is of utmost importance to stipulate the "right to health" in the constitution and obtain the protection of the constitution. It not only conforms to the world trend, but also meets domestic needs, and has other constitutional precedents to follow, and is not a self-created thing. The people's eyes are the clearest, and the people's views on politics are the most realistic. The constitution is the people's own constitution. Now is the time to discuss the May 5th Draft Constitution. Rather than haggling over the issue of equal rights between the central and provincial governments, or the issue of checks and balances between the executive and legislative branches, it is better to discuss the important rights related to the people themselves, which will surely be gladly accepted by the masses. We are one of the five powers! We hope that the human rights enjoyed by the people of the other four powers, especially the "right to health," will also be enjoyed by the people of our Republic of China. The most important thing is to clearly list this right in the constitution. It is not included in the May 5th Draft Constitution. When the constitution is formally formulated and promulgated, it is hoped that a separate article on the "right to health" will be listed in the chapter on the rights of the people to meet the needs of the entire nation.

### Beiping Education Bureau Director Ying Comes to Nanjing to Petition, Requesting Relief for a 100 Million Yuan Shortfall in Education Funds

[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Correspondent] Since the government announced the new standards for the treatment of public school teachers, the living allowance for Beiping City has also been set at 50,000 yuan, and the salary is calculated at 160 times the base salary. However, the current living allowance for primary and secondary school teachers in Beiping is only 20,000 yuan, and the salary base is only calculated at 70 times. Therefore, teachers throughout the city have gone on strike. Ying Qianli, the director of the city's education bureau, stated that the city's total expenditure is only 120 million yuan, and if expenses are issued according to the new standards, there will be a shortfall of approximately 100 million yuan, making it impossible to break this deadlock. He has come to Nanjing to petition and reported the financial plight of Beiping's education to the Ministry of Education on the 26th, requesting relief. It is also reported that the city used to rely on the national revenue from the Chongwenmen customs duties to provide funding. It is now planned to submit a request to the Executive Yuan based on the previous example, requesting the central government to allocate education funds to avoid "cooking without rice." (Yu)

### Teacher Appreciation Football Exhibition Match: Old Boys Team Defeats Referees, East China vs. Westerners Mixed Team, Mayor Qian and Chairman Wu's Performance Remarkable, Ying Xingjiu Buys Charity Ball for 3 Million

The Teacher Appreciation Movement football exhibition match was held at Yiyuan yesterday starting at 3:00 PM. In addition to the big match between East China and the Westerners mixed team, there was also an old boys' match and a physical education association versus referees association match. Therefore, although ticket prices were sold for 2,000 and 5,000, the audience still came enthusiastically and the atmosphere was enthusiastic, which was unprecedented. Mayor Qian, Chairman Wu, Director of Education Gu, General Li Chongshi, Director Yu, and others personally put on their uniforms and played, and their performances were brilliant. It was truly commendable. Halfway through the match, the match ball was auctioned off, and Mr. Ying Xingjiu of United Motors Co. bought it for 3 million yuan, which was admirable for his enthusiasm. The results of the two matches are as follows:

Old Boys Win

At 3:00 PM sharp, the old boys' match started first, with Dai Linjing as the referee and Li Yichen and Cai Shengmiao as the linesmen. All the old boys of the Physical Education Association took to the field and actually played very well. However, at first, they were not strong enough, so the referee took advantage of the situation and scored in the fourth minute, opening the scoring. Not long after, Jin Xibo's long shot broke the net again, and the referees scored two goals in a row. The Physical Education Association quickly brought in Zhou Jiaqi, Li Ning, Xu Wenkui, Qian Xucang, Zhou Jun, etc. Wang Weijun bravely took the lead and built the first merit for the association. In the 20th minute, A'kui shot a cold arrow from 30 yards away, and the ball bounced off the crossbar and went in, making it a tie of 2-2. However, before the end of the first half, Zhang Lemiao scored a goal, and the referees took the lead with a score of 3-2. In the second half, the Physical Education Association launched an all-out attack. In the fifth minute, they equalized again, making it 3-3. Soon after, A'kui headed the ball, and Wang Weijun rushed to it in time and pushed it into the net, and the Physical Education Association took the lead. In the tenth minute, Qu Xirong sent the ball to the center, and A'kui slammed it in, making it 5-3. After that, the referees tried their best to counterattack, but the Physical Education Association's central defender Wu Shaoshu and goalkeeper Zhou Jiaqi had a tight defense, making it difficult to succeed. In the end, the Physical Education Association defeated the referees 5-3.

### International Military Track and Field Meet: Outstanding Performances; Wu Bixian Takes Second in High Jump, Yang Yuqing Third in Long Jump

The International Military Track and Field Meet, organized by the Military Affairs Commission's War Service Corps, was held at Zhongzheng Park yesterday starting at 9 a.m. It attracted 6,000 spectators. The performances were outstanding, especially in the javelin event, where American athlete H. Hudson set a new national record of 57.78 meters, breaking the previous record of 53.87 meters held by our country's Zhou Changxing. In the high jump, Wu Bixian competed fiercely with American athlete Malcolm, with Wu stopping at 1.76 meters. Malcolm won first place with 1.83 meters. In the long jump, our national army's Yang Yuqing took third place, which was no easy feat.

In the track events, H. Totley swept the top spots in two short-distance races with good times. Black athlete King came in second twice. In the 1500-meter race, our country's famous athletes Wang Zhenglin and Lou Wenao participated, but due to a lack of stamina, they were surpassed by Vansville, etc. Lou finished fourth, and Wang finished fifth. In the overall individual score, Malcolm and Hudson both scored nine points and shared the championship. After the competition, Mayor Qian presented the awards. American representative Atimaer gave a thank-you speech on behalf of the military, and Mei Qiju of the Service Corps gave a reply. The event then concluded. The results are as follows:

The current peak price (market) has reached 50,000 white yuan, and top white japonica and indica rice are selling for 41,200 yuan, which has a huge and significant impact. It is reported that 10 merchants are using the high price of rice and increased expenses as excuses to raise the prices of their goods, and if this continues, the future will be difficult to predict.

Yesterday, the prices of various grains rose sharply. The price of rice rose by another 3,000 yuan, the price of flour outside the market continued to rise, adding another 1,500 to 1,600 yuan, the oil market also soared by 5,000 to 7,800 yuan, soybeans skyrocketed by 1,230 yuan, peanuts followed by 2,300 yuan, bean cakes did not want to be left behind, rising by 800 to 900 yuan, bran also rose by 500 to 600 yuan, various grains came from behind, adding 3,4000 yuan, sesame rose by 2,300 yuan, and corn also rose by 2,000 yuan. There are few formal market prices.

It is also reported that there are delays in the transportation and sales of merchants who purchase large quantities of grain, which is suspected of intentional hoarding. Once discovered, they will be severely punished. In addition, the Ministry of Food recently consulted with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to purchase rice and wheat from Siam, Burma, and other places in Hua for relief. Negotiations are still underway. Although no agreement has been reached, it is reported that the British side has expressed approval, but only the quantity is being discussed. According to the person in charge of the Ministry of Food in Shanghai, the procedures for purchasing grain will be completed in a short period of time, so overseas grain will soon arrive in the Shanghai market. It is reported that the second batch of grain purchase loans ordered by the Ministry of Food is set at 1.5 billion yuan, and the allocation of the loan purchasing area is very broad, with Shanghai accounting for only 300 million yuan.

### Gold Price Rises by 25,000

Yesterday, raw gold turned from flat to firm. After securities firms profited, the remaining capital was slightly absorbed. Buying interest was slightly excited in the bland market. It opened flat in the morning, and activity began to be seen after 10 o'clock. Securities firms and Guangdong firms came to absorb slightly. At noon, it approached the 1.6 million mark again. In the afternoon, it once exceeded the 1.6 million mark and then slightly recovered. As a result, it rose by 25,000. Gold jewelry was listed up to 170,000 yuan. Silver was 1,600.

Unified C bonds opened in the morning and rose to 7,400 yuan. Halfway through, the high price of 7,600 yuan was seen, and then major players closed out one after another, once falling back to 6,800 yuan.

### US Dollars Stable, Hong Kong Bills Popular

The US dollar turned stable after weakness, but the process was very mediocre. Payments for cotton yarn turned to India and Hong Kong, causing the US dollar to be relatively cold. It opened flat in the morning. After opening, there was physical outflow, once falling to around 2,290 yuan, but soon it rebounded. In the morning, it hovered around 2,320 yuan. The market continued to rise slightly. As a result, it closed up 30 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong bills were affected by the yarn traders' strong purchase of Hong Kong dollars, and operators in Hong Kong exchange rates covered their positions, which led to an increase of 28 yuan. Hong Kong electricity rose from 420 yuan to 440 yuan, and Robbie rose above 540 yuan.

### Ping Shui New Tea Opens; Sales Price Not Optimistic

The "flag spear" produced in Shaoxing Ping Shui is not inferior in quality to Wenzhou goods, but production was delayed until yesterday. The tea market in the city is now in decline, so the opening price was not optimistic, at 200,000 yuan per dan. The buying interest in other grades of tea remains weak, while the suppliers are constantly agitated, and the market is generally in a downward process.

### Sugar Price Rises Endlessly

Yesterday, the sugar market continued to rise sharply. The Association's medium-sized sand white once soared to 73,000 yuan in the morning, a rise of as much as 7,000 yuan, and then slightly declined, to 72,500 yuan to 71,000 yuan. In the afternoon, the Association's warehouse warrants were more popular, at 71,200 yuan, outside warehouse goods were 70,500 yuan, and customer goods were 70,000 yuan.

### Market Filled with Rumors of Resumption; Chinese and Foreign Stocks Surge

Large-scale inter-dealer transactions of Chinese stocks continue to be on hold. The report stated that Minister Yu said that the government would levy new taxes, and related to the issue of the resumption of the exchange. The general mentality believes that the exchange will soon resume operations. Although it is sensitive, it provides great encouragement to stock buyers. Each popular stock jumped a little in the morning. Buyers competed together. Trading was conducted in secret, and it was not easy to obtain an opponent. The market price was called higher and higher. Near noon, they all ended at new high prices. Due to the relationship of resumption, a general buying wave also rose in neglected stocks. Once a public market is established, the current distorted phenomenon will inevitably be thoroughly reformed, then the distance between popular and neglected stocks will be greatly narrowed. After the high noon closing, it recovered slightly. As a result, popular stocks each rose by about 15% compared to the previous close. Xinhuo, Zhongfa, Xinya underwear each rose by 20% to 35%, Zhongfang Dachanghua rose by only about 10%. Each veteran stock has not turned strong, only called stable. In the afternoon, the asking price of each popular stock still had a board height.

Yisha jumped to 15,700 yuan in the morning, Yipi 3,500 yuan, British United 15,800 yuan, and buyers searched endlessly. At noon, they all ended at peak levels. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yisha rose by 2,000 yuan. British United's subsequent strength was insufficient and showed a slight decline, only rising by 1,000 yuan, Jardine Matheson rose by 2,500. In addition, each small stock also rose by about 10%.

### Few Spot Supplies; Cotton Zhangjiang Market Lively

Yesterday, the yarn market returned to the upstream. The Tianjin and Hankou gangs had very good turnover. Customers from Changjiang Road Jingwu also had considerable acceptance, so each brand of 20-count yarn rose by 34,000 again. The spot supply is still not much. 16-count also rose by 12,000. 42-count Blue Phoenix is popular, with off-market transactions of 1.8 million. People's hearts are firm, and the trend is very good.

The high-grade Meite Lin delivered to the factory reached 92,000 yuan. The market price was stimulated by the rise in stock prices and yarn prices, rising by another 12,000 yuan.

### Woolen Cloth Appears Stable, But Is Weak Underneath

Except for summer goods such as Van Liding, Yu Yarn, Screw Four, Pali Si, Yarn Linen Tape, Yellow Green Twill, etc., there are few transactions recently. The market atmosphere at the Public Tea Association is dull. The standard market generally presents a stable but weak appearance. The sellers of general summer goods are unwilling to depreciate because of the lack of inventory and the remaining two months of actual sales. Buyers dislike that it has always been hovering at peaks and it is difficult for merchants to sell. Except for some inevitable advances, sales are far inferior to previous summer sales.

### US Senators Again Suggest Selling Silver

Mexico Abolishes Silver Export Tax

[Reuters Washington, 27th] Senator Green has suggested selling silver in the Treasury at a price of 71.125 cents per ounce for two years to meet industrial needs. The Senate Allocations Subcommittee has temporarily decided to obtain opinions from some opposing parties before making a decision on this proposal.

[Reuters Mexico City, 27th] Mexico has abolished the export tax of 3.27 cents per ounce of silver. Officials estimate that this measure will bring more benefits of 2 million US dollars to Mexican silver mining companies, most of which are owned by the United States.

### New Company Law; Limited Company Shareholders Still Have Ambiguities Awaiting Explanation

Shen Jia Zhen, a company teacher in the city, and others, have doubts about Article 105 of Chapter 5 of the revised New Company Law of the National Government, and yesterday specially presented it to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for explanation. Briefly stated: "Checking Article 105 of Chapter 5 of the New Company Law, the Limited Company must have an organization of two or more shareholders and less than ten people, etc., I have doubts. It is suspected that the number of shareholders stipulated in this article, two or more and less than ten, should be the initial organization. However, the financial resources of each shareholder change over time, how can they remain unchanged? For example: a Limited Company, originally organized by ten shareholders, later one shareholder, due to financial difficulties, cannot maintain his original shares, so he transfers a part of the shares to others. If it is limited that non-original shareholders cannot accept, then it is feared that the original shareholders may not intend to accept, or collude with each other, so suppressing the shares seems inappropriate. If it is transferred to another person, then the number of shareholders in this company is more than ten people. According to the regulations in Article 105, it seems to be a violation; but according to Article 121, shareholders can transfer all or part of their shares to others, then there is no violation. I don’t know how to deal with it? In order to specifically ask Jun Department to give an explanation, so that we can follow!"

### Brazil Tung Oil Recently Increased Production Sharply

[Reuters London, 27th] According to a recent report by the Carnegie Institute, Brazil has the potential to become a vegetable oil producing and marketing country. It is said that the tung oil production in São Paulo, Paraná, and Rio Grande do Sul is increasing sharply.

### South African Gold Rumored to Increase in Price

[Reuters Johannesburg, 27th] There is a rumor in the market that gold will increase in price soon. According to Reuters news, there may be some technical changes in gold trading, affecting the transaction of South African gold sold to London, but the world gold price will remain unchanged.

### Dried Longan Continues to Rise

Yesterday, the price of large dried longan rose again in the market, rising by another 3,000 yuan, opening to 63,000 yuan. Lanzhuzhi spot transactions are 135,000 yuan, and the market situation is firm.

### Economic Briefs

It is reported that the number of overdue counterfeit banknotes that have not been exchanged is still 12 billion, and the face value is below 200 yuan. The Ministry of Finance once ordered the Central Bank in various places to complete the registration, but according to the person in charge of the issuance bureau of the Shanghai branch, very few people have applied.

The Shanghai branch of the China Farmers Bank recently held four types of emergency agricultural loans, silkworm seed farm loans, silkworm breeding loans, and small-scale water conservancy loans. It is reported that many nearby counties have recently applied to the bank for loans. As of recently, the bank has released 20,325,000 yuan in emergency agricultural loans, 177,200,000 yuan in silkworm seed farm loans, 135,390,000 yuan in silkworm breeding loans, and 2,000,000 yuan in small-scale water conservancy loans. It is still continuing to release loans. Since the Liangzhe Salt Administration continued to register newly established small salt merchants, more than 500 businesses in the city have been approved to operate. All salt dealers will implement universal distribution. In recent days, applications for supplementary registration have been very enthusiastic, and the bureau will not restrict them.

The government has formulated a plan for disaster relief in Hunan: (1) Allocate 500 million yuan from the Four Joint Banks as a grain purchase fund, (2) Transport 4 million shi of surplus grain from Sichuan Province to Hunan as soon as possible, (3) Reduce the amount of military grain purchased in Hunan Province, and (4) Transport grain stored in Nanjing to Hunan Province.

Due to drastic fluctuations in prices in Hankou, the amount of funds needed has increased, resulting in high interest rates. The black market interest rate is particularly alarming. Currently, the market is 4 yuan per day, the term interest is 7 yuan, and the monthly interest is 3%. There is also the so-called "Kua Zi Qian", which is a principal of 7,000 yuan, with a total monthly repayment of 10,000 yuan, and the "Bian Zi Qian" which is a principal of 10,000 yuan, with a monthly interest of 300 yuan.

Qingdao Baolong Foreign Company has begun to receive orders. Caustic soda is currently priced at US$35 per barrel, but the shipping schedule cannot be determined, and there are not many transactions at present.

Film and Drama

### Regarding Film People Who Collaborated with the Enemy

— Xu Suling

During the Anti-Japanese War, Shanghai's Changying business was controlled by the enemy and puppets. Some film merchants and film practitioners, especially after the outbreak of the Pacific War, due to pessimistic understanding and excessive selfish concepts, willingly served the enemy and cooperated with the enemy and puppets, turning the entire Shanghai film industry into an institution under the control of the enemy and puppets. In this middle, most of the employees were indeed forced to participate in the film business institutions of the enemy and puppets due to the pressure of life during this period. Now that the enemy has surrendered for eight months, the Shanghai enemy and puppet film business institutions, except for those that originally cooperated with the enemy and puppets and sold to the enemy and puppets, some parts were originally occupied or leased from the people, and after being taken over, some have been cleared and returned, and some are being investigated and returned. As for a group of film people who collaborated with the enemy, except for twenty-one who have been arrested, whether the majority of others need to be punished or identified, although there have been several symposiums and what meeting mentioned it, there has been no decision so far.

China's film industry was originally very backward, and there was a great lack of talent. As far as I know, most of the employees who participated in the pseudo-film institutions were indeed living in poverty, and the content of the films they produced (I have read all the film scripts produced by "Huaying") except for a very small number with problems, most of them did not oppose the government's anti-war policy. There were even works of educational significance. Of course, there are a small number of "Huaying" senior personnel, especially those who cooperated with the enemy and puppets at the upper level, regardless of whether they withdrew from "Huaying" midway, but they lived comfortably, which shows that they used the power of the enemy and puppets at that time to accumulate wealth and exploit the poor employees. After victory, they still live comfortably and cleverly cover up their crimes. However, because this group of people is not purely employees, their names are not necessarily on the credits of the films. Therefore, they are not noticed by people. In addition, they have money and can move around in all directions. However, most employees, they have had more than 20 years of experience in film art and technology, and at least six or seven years of history. They are now waiting for legal punishment, or to be freed. Although their bodies are very free, they need to live and need to work. Before the identity of the film people who collaborated with the enemy is determined, they cannot get work. In particular, for some directors, it is so difficult to train a film director in China.

I have been back to Shanghai for seven or eight months. Because of my job, I haven't said anything. But I saw that those who should be restrained have ways to deal with it, while those who are usually very poor can't move at all and can't live. I can't help but put forward a few suggestions to the Fu Bureau and people who care about the film industry:

1. Please ask the competent authorities and judicial organs to promptly investigate and report the film people who collaborated with the enemy, and punish them (although I know that the relevant institutions have submitted a list of reports, but no news has been seen so far). At the same time, issue measures for punishing personnel who participated in pseudo-film institutions, so that a small number of people who willingly serve the enemy can receive their due punishment, and the majority of employees can also restore their work under certain measures.

2. Please ask people who care about the film industry and film practitioners themselves to collect evidence of the crimes of film people who collaborated with the enemy, and report them to the government's competent authorities, or directly report them to the court.

3. Please ask the government's competent authorities to send personnel to jointly review all the products of the so-called pseudo "Huaying" with prestigious scholars, so as to judge the crimes of film practitioners from their works.

### Record of the Two Main Actors in "The Bells of St. Mary's"

— Xin Ming

The highest-grossing and considered best film in the United States for 1945 was "The Bells of St. Mary's." Its popularity was due to the exquisite performances of its stars, Bing Crosby and Ingrid Bergman, and the novel and skillful direction of Leo McCarey.

This film was released before Christmas last year as a precious gift to welcome the first major festival after the peace. When it was screened in New York, Americans went somewhat crazy for it. Every day, the theater entrances were crowded, with people scrambling to get in, far surpassing the sold-out success of films in Shanghai, demonstrating the astonishing American passion for movies and the incredible nature of this film. The film was produced by Rainbow Company, owned by Bing Crosby, and distributed by RKO Pictures.

Now, let's talk about the two main actors. Male lead Bing Crosby has been in the film industry for eighteen years. In recent years, he has become very popular in Hollywood, twice earning the top spot among the top ten highest-grossing stars in 1944 and 1945. He has co-starred with Dorothy Lamour in many films, such as "Road to Singapore" and "Road to Zanzibar," which have been screened in Shanghai. After watching his films, I don't think anyone could resist his baritone voice! He not only became famous on the screen but also dedicated himself to broadcasting. In "The Bells of St. Mary's," he plays a priest with a strong desire for education, founding a school filled with his care, compassion, and warmth.

As for the female lead, Ingrid Bergman, she is a Swede. Her role in "Intermezzo" with Leslie Howard was the first film to make her famous. She later starred in "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde," "Casablanca," "For Whom the Bell Tolls," and others, all of which received critical acclaim. Last year, she starred in three major films: "Spellbound," "Saratoga Trunk" (with Gary Cooper), and "The Bells of St. Mary's." The famous American magazine "Life" even said that 1945 was "Bergman's Year." In "The Bells of St. Mary's," she plays a nun in a Catholic church, with acting skills that are perfect and sublime, reaching the pinnacle. Henry Travers also delivers an excellent performance, playing a landlord who is prone to bizarre ideas and complaints. Do you remember him? He is also the stationmaster in "Mrs. Miniver," Walter Pidgeon! This supporting role adds much color to every film.

### Hollywood News

Two atomic bombs ended World War II, and Hollywood producers are very aware of the excitement surrounding this name. They are all trying to acquire screenplays that use the deployment of the atomic bomb as a plot element. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer has adopted a script by Bob Considine. According to Sam Marx, the film describes the story of the atomic bomb's creators sacrificing themselves and working hard to research until its completion. Although it is not a documentary, it is based on facts. During filming, the American Association of Scientists sent experts to serve as consultants and liaised with the Atomic Energy Commission.

Ronald Colman's status in the film industry is comparable to that of John Barrymore and Douglas Fairbanks. Now, only Colman remains in the film industry, spanning two eras, from silent films to sound films to color films, a truly difficult and honorable achievement. This June, his contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer will expire, and Colman intends to retire.

Xu Xiaoyan, Deputy Director of the Central Propaganda Department, visited "China Electric" and had a photo taken in the sets of "Loyal Family" as a memento.

### Community Service

Mr. Wu Xiwei asks: (1) The rental contract was originally indefinite, but the lessee voluntarily established a fixed term of five years, filled it out himself, and both parties sealed it. The fixed term is about to expire soon. What procedures should be followed to recover the house? (2) I only have one storefront property, which was rented out in the 26th year of the Republic of China. Now I want to open my own store for self-use, so the contract was not renewed. Fortunately, the War of Resistance was won, and the property rights are protected again. Please advise on how to recover the house?

[Reply from Lawyer Fu Kuanglin] (1) According to the law, the lease can indeed be recovered upon the expiration of the fixed-term lease. However, it is still necessary to see if there is a provision in the lease agreement that allows for renewal. (2) If only the guarantor has moved elsewhere, it cannot be immediately assumed that the entire contract is invalid. If the lessor must recover the property for self-use, there must be solid evidence to support the claim.

Mr. Huang Huayi asks: According to the provisions of Article 1 of the Lawyer Law, as amended and promulgated on April 5, 1945 of the Republic of China, it does not seem that "graduation from the law department of a university or independent college or studying law for more than three years and obtaining a diploma" is a requirement for obtaining lawyer qualifications. Is this really the case according to the law? A friend of mine graduated from a general high school course and has worked in a law firm for fifteen years. If he does not pursue higher education, but intends to obtain lawyer qualifications through higher examinations or other examinations, is this possible? Please provide guidance.

[Reply from Lawyer Fu Kuanglin] According to the provisions of the Lawyer Law, in addition to those who have passed the lawyer examination and are qualified as lawyers, those who have one of the qualifications listed in Article 1, Paragraph 2 of the law may be subject to strict inspection. However, our country has not yet held a lawyer examination.

Mr. Wang Dao asks: I am from Dongtai, Subei. I run a business and have earned some surplus. After the surrender of the enemy last year, I was deeply afraid of attacks by the Communist army, which would inevitably lead to losses. At that time, I sold my goods and purchased more than one hundred acres of farmland to avoid losses. I would like to ask: (1) Does the above-mentioned sale of property rights have legal effect? (2) The seller is a widow, with no children, only two daughters. Although there is a nephew, the nephew is not named on the contract, but is named with her two daughters. Their families have been living separately for more than ten years, and there is no entanglement in the family. However, the nephew is not used, but is named with the two daughters. Does this contract have legal effect? (3) At that time, the land price was calculated in counterfeit currency, but later, when the Communist army captured it, a small amount of the final price was not settled. In the future, when settling the account, it should be converted into legal currency according to the number. This is a special situation. If the other party has different words, is it valid? (4) Are wartime real estate transactions legally valid?

[Reply from Lawyer Fu Kuanglin] (1) If the procedures are complete, it can naturally take effect according to the law. (2) If the nephew is not the widow's adopted son, there is no need to name him, and it can take effect. (3) When paying the final price in the future, counterfeit currency can no longer be used, and it should of course be converted into legal currency at the rate, which does not affect the validity of the transaction. (4) Legal transactions between private individuals during wartime are valid.
