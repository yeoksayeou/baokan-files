### Chairman's Instructions on Constitutional Principles: Considering the Overall Situation, Major Changes Should Be Avoided; Hope to Conclude the Assembly Within This Week

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 16th] At 12:30 PM on the 16th, Chairman Chiang invited representatives of the Kuomintang attending the comprehensive committee to lunch. He repeatedly urged them to consider the overall situation and avoid making major changes to the original draft constitution. He also expressed the hope that the assembly would conclude within the week. It is widely believed that the comprehensive review of the draft constitution will proceed smoothly thereafter.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] The central memorial week was held at the National Government at 8:30 AM on the 16th. Representatives of the Kuomintang National Assembly were again invited to participate. Chairman Chiang personally led the ceremony and delivered a speech, stating in brief that the National Assembly had been in session for four weeks, and this was the final week. This stage is the most crucial juncture for the constitutional drafting work. He hoped that the representatives of the Kuomintang would clearly understand the current world trends and the domestic situation, discern the advantages and disadvantages, and mutually advise each other. He also urged them not to change the important principles of the draft constitution proposed by the government and to jointly complete the constitutional mission.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 16th] It is reported that some Kuomintang representatives have held several meetings in recent days and drafted sixteen articles of amendment to the draft constitution. The spirit of these articles is still based on the spirit of the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and incorporates the opinions of various parties. These opinions were presented to the Chairman during lunch on the 16th and were deemed feasible by the Chairman.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 16th] The review of the draft constitution proceeded extremely smoothly on the 16th. A meeting of the conveners of the comprehensive review committee will be held at 10:00 AM on the 17th to discuss the organization and personnel of the sorting group. The fourth comprehensive review committee meeting will be held at 3:00 PM in the afternoon.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 16th] The meeting of the conveners of the comprehensive review committee was held at 10:00 AM on the 16th, chaired by Chen Qitian. The important decisions are as follows:

A. The scope of review by the comprehensive committee hereafter: (1) those that the minority party strongly opposes as a result of each review committee; (2) those that the government deems unenforceable as a result of each review committee; (3) those that have conflicting results from the two review groups; (4) those that have not been decided by the review committee and are submitted to the comprehensive review committee for decision; (5) those in which the comprehensive committee has adopted the opinion of a certain review committee, but the related articles must be amended accordingly.

B.

Its tasks are: (1) to study the results of the review committees according to the above scope; (2) to propose preliminary solutions; (3) to preliminarily sort out the text.

C. After summarizing the review opinions of each group, the original fourteen issues have now been merged into eleven issues in order to simplify them.

### Kuomintang National Assembly Representatives' Opinions on Revising the Draft Constitution

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 16th] The Kuomintang National Assembly representatives' opinions on revising the draft constitution are as follows: (1) Article 1 of the general principles should maintain the original draft and not be amended to "The Republic of China is a democratic republic based on the Three Principles of the People."

### Comprehensive Review Committee Passes Resolution for President to Convene National Assembly; Discussions on the Powers of the Legislative Yuan Still Yield No Results

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 16th] The Comprehensive Review Committee held its third meeting at 3:30 PM on the 16th, with 155 representatives present, chaired by Chen Cheng. First, the report of the Presidium meeting was given, presenting the matters decided by the conveners' meeting as follows: (1) the scope of review of the Comprehensive Committee, (2) the organization of the sorting group, (3) from this meeting onwards, proceed according to the agenda issued by the Secretariat, and for speeches on the same topic, each person is limited to two speeches, each speech limited to five minutes. After the report, there were slight objections, and it was quickly passed by a majority vote. The chairman then announced the discussion of eight items: (1) the powers of the National Assembly, (2) the convening of the National Assembly, (3) the issue of people's public service, (4) the issue of chapters and sections in Chapter Four, (5) the issue of emergency events, (6) the issue of the powers of the Legislative Yuan, (7) the issue of the number of members of the Legislative Yuan, (8) the issue of auditing power. The discussion is recorded as follows:

Powers of the National Assembly

(1) Regarding the issue of the powers of the National Assembly, the chairman reported that the issue of the number of minority representatives had not yet been fully studied and would not be discussed for the time being. Subsequently, a majority of the representatives spoke. Jiang Yuntian of the Democratic Socialist Party stated first: that he could not agree with some of the amendments to the draft constitution, such as the original draft stating that members of the Legislative Yuan were elected by the people and members of the Control Yuan were elected by the provincial assemblies, but now they have all been changed to elections by the National Assembly, which he could not agree to. The presidents of the Judicial Yuan and the Examination Yuan should also not be elected by the National Assembly, because these are specialized talents, and the president of the Examination Yuan should be nominated by the President, not elected or impeached by the National Assembly. Electing members of the Legislative Yuan is a direct democratic right and should be directly elected by the people, and the original draft should be maintained. Democratic Socialist Party representative Zhu Hongru stated: that after the amendments to the draft constitution, the powers of the National Assembly are too great, almost overturning all the principles of the draft constitution. There are currently two types of democratic systems in the world: one is the representative system, and the other is the direct democratic system. Mr. Sun Yat-sen advocated the latter. Now that the National Assembly is placed above the five Yuans, how can democratic rights be exercised, which is quite problematic? The National Assembly has violated the principles of direct democracy. The term of office for representatives of the National Assembly is six years, and the National Assembly meets once every two years. Who exercises political power during the recess? With the National Assembly placed above the Legislative Yuan, the Legislative Yuan has clearly become indirect and even more indirect democratic rights. The Examination and Judicial Yuans should increase their non-partisanship, and the President should select and appoint talented individuals. If there is no amendment, then this National Assembly will become a constitution of one power. Youth Party representative Chen Qitian then stated: that he deeply felt that the reason why China has not been able to complete a good constitution is based on the stubborn prejudices of all parties and has not taken into account two things: one is disregarding whether the constitution can have good effects and focusing on international relations, and the other is not paying attention to practical effects, so it cannot obtain successful factors. Based on the above two points, the powers of the National Assembly are even higher than those stipulated in the Five-Five Draft Constitution, which will make the international situation even worse. He is not speaking for the Youth Party, but for the compatriots of the whole country. This issue may cause political changes. He believes that the expansion of the powers of the National Assembly by the amendment will not have any effect, because the National Assembly meets once every two years, so it is difficult to talk about practical effects. If we want to realize true popular supervision of the government, it is not necessary to concentrate power in the National Assembly, but to separate it. He advocated maintaining the original draft. After discussion, the third clause of Article 27 "Initiation of constitutional amendments" was changed to "Amendment of the Constitution." When put to a vote, it passed by a majority of 117 votes.

Convening of Meetings

(2) Regarding the issue of the convening of the National Assembly, Deputy Secretary-General Lei Zhen reported that the amendment would change the original Article 29, 30, and 31 into two articles. After discussion, it was decided to amend Article 29 to "The National Assembly shall be convened by the President 90 days before the expiration of each presidential term." Article 30 should use the amended opinion, and Article 31 should be deleted.

People's Public Service

(3) Regarding the issue of people's public service, the First Review Committee had amended Article 21, adding the word "corvée". The Democratic Socialist Party raised an objection, believing that the addition of corvée would easily be exploited by officials, township chiefs, paochia, and local bullies at all levels, depriving the people of their freedom and causing social unrest, and the original draft should be maintained. This case caused a dispute, and then Chen Cheng withdrew from the chairman's position, stating: that he advocated maintaining the original draft, which was immediately passed by a majority vote.

Chapters and Sections in Chapter Four

(4) Regarding the issue of chapters and sections in Chapter Four, because some people advocated that Chapter Four should be changed to the central government, and the President, Executive, and Legislative branches should be listed as section headings, while others believed that it was not necessary to divide into chapters, Shi Shangkuan and Lin Bin both spoke. Finally, Li Jingzhai proposed that it should be handed over to the sorting group, which was immediately passed.

Emergency Events

(5) Regarding the issue of emergency events, Jiang Yiping spoke, maintaining the original draft and stating that it was not necessary to add these four words, which was immediately passed at that time.

Powers of the Legislative Yuan

(6) Regarding the issue of the powers of the Legislative Yuan, there were many opinions on Article 62, with some believing that the word "national" should be changed to "central", some believing that "the legislative organ is elected by the people" should be changed to "is organized by the people", and some believing that the word "highest" was extremely inappropriate. After a very long discussion, there was no result, and it was decided to hand it over to the sorting group.

Number of Members of the Legislative Yuan

(7) Regarding the issue of the number of members of the Legislative Yuan, a majority advocated maintaining the original draft of Article 65, but changing the first paragraph, which stated five people per province and city, to two people per province and city, and increasing one person for every one million people, to increasing one person for every five million people. The issue of the number of representatives from Xinjiang and overseas Chinese was still handed over to the sorting group.

Auditing Power

(8) Article 75 on auditing power should follow the original draft, Article 76 should be deleted, and changed to two articles as follows: (1) The Control Yuan shall establish an Auditor-General, who shall be nominated by the President and appointed with the consent of the Legislative Yuan; (2) The Auditor-General shall submit an audit report to the Legislative Yuan within three months after the completion of the audit. The meeting adjourned at 5:53 PM.

### Amidst Contentious Debates on the Revision of the Draft Constitution, the Democratic Socialist Party Expresses Its Attitude, Requesting the Maintenance of the Principles Discussed in the Political Consultative Conference

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 16th] Jin Houcheng, Secretary-General of the Democratic Socialist Party, explained the party's three points of view on the draft constitution at a press reception held by the Central Propaganda Department on the 16th, stating:

(1) Regarding the original text of Article 1 of the Constitution, it was once amended by the First Review Committee to "The Republic of China is a democratic republic based on the Three Principles of the People," and then amended again by the Comprehensive Committee to "The Republic of China is a democratic republic based on the Three Principles of the People." The party believes that this article, which stipulates the form of government, should preferably be changed to "The Republic of China is a democratic republic." It is claimed that, on this point, President Chiang agreed with representatives of the party and the Youth Party that the four words "Three Principles of the People" should be added solemnly to the foreword.

(2) Regarding the chapter on the National Assembly, the party believes that it is inappropriate to have any additions beyond the original powers of the National Assembly. It is now heard that the Comprehensive Committee has added the following clause to the powers of the National Assembly: "The National Assembly is the highest organ representing the people of the Republic of China in the exercise of political power." The party believes that this addition is also inappropriate. As such, it violates the fundamental spirit of democracy. According to the draft constitution, in addition to the National Assembly, there is also a Legislative Yuan, both of which are produced by direct elections. The powers of the National Assembly are limited to electing the President, as in the United States. If the current amendment is followed, it would be close to a one-power system, affecting the Legislative Yuan. It would be inappropriate and undemocratic to implement.

(3) According to the original text of the draft constitution, the President may issue emergency decrees under certain circumstances. However, as a result of the current review, the four words "emergency events" have been added. The constitution is the fundamental law of the country for centuries, not a question of people, but a permanent question. Adding words such as "emergency events" is really inappropriate, so the party advocates maintaining the original draft.

Regarding the first point, President Chiang had a written document supporting the amendment.

Regarding the latter two, because the problems occurred after President Chiang met with representatives of the two parties, they were not discussed. However, it is believed that President Chiang also feels that it is better not to add to the powers of the National Assembly. Jin also pointed out that the party attaches the most importance to the above three points, and other insignificant details can be resolved through compromise. The party believes that the reason why the Republic of China has this opportunity to engage in constitutional work is because the Kuomintang is reasonable and hopes to be reasonable to the end so that the constitutional work can be completed.

At today's reception, Xu Chuanlin from the party was originally scheduled to attend, but because Xu attended the Comprehensive Committee, Jin and Li Junfu, another National Assembly representative from the party, attended instead. In addition to reporting the party's attitude towards the draft constitution, Jin also answered other questions related to the party.

A reporter asked what attitude the Democratic Socialist Party would adopt if the above three points could not achieve results satisfactory to the Democratic Socialist Party at the future assembly.

Jin replied: The party believes that this National Assembly is based on the Political Consultative Conference, and the party regrets that the draft constitution was not drafted entirely according to the principles of the Political Consultative Conference. Some members of the Kuomintang also hold the same view. Most members of the Kuomintang are reasonable and hope that they can be calm and recognize that the party does not need to express its attitude on this.

Another reporter asked whether they would participate in the reorganized government? According to the answer, the Political Consultative Conference did agree at that time that the government should be jointly formed by various parties, but the realization of this matter still depends on the arrival of the opportunity to organize such a government, so the party has not yet considered it. Regarding the relationship between the party and the Democratic League, Jin said: The party's attitude remains unchanged, and hopes that the Democratic League and the Communist Party can understand. As for whether the Central Standing Committee of the Democratic League will order the party to withdraw from the League, Jin said that he could not be sure and would have to consider it when such a situation arises. When asked about the party's own internal strife between the North and the South, Jin admitted that there were such rumors, but said that, at least on the point of participating in the National Assembly, the entire party was united. Jin declined to answer questions about rumors that a certain member of the party had bad habits.

### Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart Jointly Meet with Chairman; Wang Bingnan Visits Ambassador Stuart and Holds a Long Conversation; Possibly Discussing the Issue of Sending Personnel to Yan'an

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 16th] Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart jointly visited Chairman Chiang at 5:00 PM on the 15th. Wang Bingnan of the Communist Party Liaison Office visited Ambassador Stuart at 12:00 AM on the 16th and met for an hour. According to Communist Party spokesman Mei Yi, Ambassador Stuart informally told Wang Bingnan everything discussed with Chairman Chiang on the evening of the 15th, but this was purely ordinary social interaction and could not indicate the possibility of reopening peace talks. Regarding rumors that the government was sending personnel to Yan'an, Mei said that he was not aware of it.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 16th] Shao Lizi recently told reporters that he had not heard anything about going to Yan'an, but he hoped that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party could sincerely unite and cooperate, so if the government really sent him, he would certainly do so. Shao continued, indicating that the joint visit of Marshall and Stuart to Chairman Chiang today, as well as Wang Bingnan's visit to Ambassador Stuart today, may be discussing the issue of sending personnel to Yan'an.

### Shao Lizi Discusses the Constitution

Even if There Are Resolutions in the Review Committee, They Will Definitely Be Vetoed by the Comprehensive Committee and the General Assembly

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 16th] According to Shao Lizi, he is very optimistic about the passage of the draft constitution, believing that although some opposing views have achieved some success in the review committee, they will definitely be vetoed in the comprehensive committee and even the general assembly due to the small number of people. Shao completely agreed with the four points raised by Zhang Junli, believing that they were correct.

### Hui Representatives Host Press Reception, Presenting Their Hopes for the National Assembly, Hoping that the Constitution Stipulates Equal Rights

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 16th] National Assembly representatives Zhao Mingyuan, Li Fengzao, Da Pusheng, Sun Shengwu, etc., representing the Hui people, held a press reception on the second floor of the National Assembly Hall at 2:00 PM on the 16th, reporting their opinions on the draft constitution and their hopes for the National Assembly, stating in brief: The more than 40 million Hui compatriots throughout the country pay the same obligations to the country for military service and tax payments as ordinary citizens, and they should also enjoy equal rights. It is hoped that the Constitution can clearly stipulate the following points: (1) Hui people elect an appropriate number of National Assembly representatives, (2) Hui people elect an appropriate number of members of the Legislative Yuan and the Control Yuan, (3) Hui people have a fixed number of places to participate in civil organs at all levels, (4) Hui people enjoy equal opportunities in education and special convenience in life.

### Zhang Lan May Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow

[Central News Agency, This City] Democratic League Chairman Zhang Lan departed from Hankou on the morning of the 15th aboard the Sanbei Company's Long'an Wheel and is expected to arrive here around the afternoon of the 18th.

### Reporters Can Enter the National Assembly Venue Through the Main Entrance

The Assault Incident Has Not Been Resolved

[French News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] When the National Assembly Comprehensive Committee met on the afternoon of the 16th, hundreds of reporters from Nanjing and Shanghai demonstrated in front of the meeting venue, presenting three demands to Hong Lanyou, Secretary-General of the Assembly: (1) News reporters should be allowed to enter the venue through the main entrance (previously, they only used the side entrance). (2) News reporters must be allowed to attend the Comprehensive Committee meetings and must not be refused their participation. (3) A certain Kuomintang representative who assaulted a reporter the other day should publicly apologize in the newspaper. Secretary-General Hong replied that the first and second conditions could be implemented immediately and ordered the opening of the main entrance, but before responding to the third condition, it was necessary to contact the representative. However, the reporters refused to enter the venue until all three conditions were fully satisfied and demanded a response within 24 hours. If they were rejected, they would ban coverage of the Assembly news.

### National Newspapers and News Agencies Collectively Petition the Ministry of Communications, Requesting Preferential Treatment for News Postage and Telegraph Fees

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 16th] National newspapers and news agencies, unable to maintain operations due to the Ministry of Communications suddenly increasing postage and telegraph fees tenfold last month, convened a joint national newspaper association meeting at the Shuzhong Hotel at 1:00 PM on the 16th. More than 100 people attended, chaired by Ma Xingye, who reported on the significance of the National Newspaper Association's organization. Then, Mao Lirui, Tang Shaolan, and Tu Shiming reported on the negotiations with the Ministry of Communications. Representatives from various places also spoke enthusiastically, all dissatisfied with the Ministry of Communications' 30% discount on telephone calls, believing that the price was still seven times higher than the old price and still unaffordable for today's extremely difficult economic situation in the newspaper industry. The preferential treatment was only extended to daily newspapers, not evening newspapers, which was considered unfair. As for postage, it was even more fatal to the newspaper industry. The postage for a mailed newspaper was more than the newspaper fee, which was unreasonable. All agreed that it must be reduced to the original price in order to maintain operations. As a result, a national newspaper petition group was organized, and more than ten people, including Gao Yixiu, were appointed as representatives to petition the Ministry of Communications. At 3:00 PM, the delegation led more than 100 Beijing reporters from national newspapers, setting off in four new Shanghai-bound cars newly supplied to Beijing by the Jiangnan Company. When the cars arrived in front of the Anle Hall in Chongqing, it coincided with the Central Propaganda Department's press reception, and more than 100 reporters from various newspapers in the meeting joined the ranks, arriving at the Ministry of Communications in a mighty and imposing manner. Minister of Communications Yu Dawei, Vice Minister Tan Boyu, and Director Tao Fengshan received them. The representatives of the petition group separately stated the suffering of private newspapers unable to maintain operations after the increase in postage and telegraph fees. Yu replied: that he was willing to discuss a proper solution with the petition group. It was decided that Yu himself, Tan Boyu, and Tao Fengshan would conduct a detailed study with the petition delegation at 3:00 PM on the 17th, and all believed that the government might accept the request of national newspapers to give preferential treatment to news postage and telegraph fees.

### Ambassador Stuart Scheduled to Go to Beiping

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 16th] Ambassador Stuart was originally scheduled to go to Beiping on the 18th, but it has been postponed due to circumstances and may take place on the 22nd. According to the U.S. Embassy, the purpose of the trip is to console U.S. expatriates in Tianjin and handle affairs at Yenching University. It is scheduled to last one week and return to Beijing on the 29th for the Lunar New Year. However, according to another source, Ambassador Stuart's trip to Beiping may be related to political discussions.

### Communist Army Internal Strife Leads to Guidance Out of the City; National Army Enters Lianshui Yesterday Afternoon; Pixian County Seat Also Recovered the Day Before Yesterday

[Central News Agency, Huaiyin, 16th] The communist army entrenched in Lianshui has unusually complex factions, often engaging in mutual sabotage. Since the ceasefire order took effect, the senior commanders of the communist army in that area launched an offensive against the National Army, intending to ease the friction between various units through the offensive. As for the National Army stationed there, it had advanced to the outskirts of Lianshui city before the ceasefire order took effect. However, due to the restrictions of the ceasefire order and to avoid contact with outposts, it had to temporarily retreat a distance. The Xinhua News Agency of the Communist Army took the opportunity to exaggerate its war achievements, claiming that it had turned from passive to active. Its offensive plan, dispatching troops and generals, will become even more active. Xu Xiangqian's 5th and 9th Liberation Divisions, and the 5th Military Sub-district troops in Northern Jiangsu, had accumulated deep grievances, making it difficult to reconcile for a time. Last night, a sudden fire broke out in Lianshui city, and heavy gunfire was heard. This morning, a unit of the communist army surrendered to the National Army, detailing the chaos in the city and offering to guide the National Army into the city to stabilize order. A unit of the National Army then rushed into the city with the surrendered communist army at 12:00 noon today to maintain security. Currently, the remaining troops of the 5th and 9th Liberation Divisions in the city have fled to the northeast of the city. The remaining troops of the 5th Military Sub-district have all surrendered to the National Army.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 16th] A unit of the National Army crossed the Grand Canal on the morning of the 15th and stationed in Pixian County Seat. County Magistrate Xin Yutang followed the army into the city to comfort the displaced people and compile and investigate the Baojia system.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 16th] Confirmed news: After the National Army recovered Yancheng on the 13th, the communist armies in various counties in northern Jiangsu were greatly shocked. The communist army trapped in Funing felt threatened and recklessly launched a desperate attack on Yancheng at dawn on the 15th. At the same time, the communist armies in coastal areas such as Dongtai Bin Hai also showed signs of attacking Bazao and Jiuzhao in eastern Jiangsu. However, the current strength of the communist army in the above-mentioned areas is indeed less than twenty regiments. This time, they are stirring up trouble again, deliberately exaggerating their claims and falsely spreading their troop strength. According to front-line news, although there is currently fighting northwest of the county seat, the communist army flees in panic as soon as contact is made. Looking at their intentions, they are still thinking of preserving their strength to prepare for sabotage. The so-called large-scale counterattack launched by the communist army in northern Jiangsu with 120,000 troops is nothing more than that.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 16th] It is reported that: (1) The battle on the Xinxingchang front north of Yancheng was fierce, with mixed fighting all day yesterday and continuing this morning. In addition, a unit of the communist army attacked from Shanggang to the west yesterday, and occupied Shiqiao at 6:00 this morning. It is now continuing to attack Chenjiaqiao to the west. Because of the disparity in numbers, the National Army moved to Huduo at 9:00 this morning. (2) More than 3,000 communist troops from Shuyang attacked Suqian from Hanji this morning. The National Army is currently intercepting them. (3) The communist troops who had infiltrated the outskirts of Qianji, a village between Huai and , have now been cleared, and fierce fighting continues in Huji.

[Our Newspaper, Taixian, 16th] The communist army previously besieged Liuzhuang with the main force of the First Division. The highway between that town and Dongtai was once cut off. After the National Army counterattacked, the communist army was defeated and retreated. The National Army took the opportunity to station in Wuyou on the 13th.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 16th] Recently, news of the war in northern Jiangsu has been conflicting. The actual situation in Yancheng is also being reported differently in Nanjing and Zhenjiang. Our reporter recently learned from reliable sources in Nanjing and Zhenjiang that the communist armies in various counties in northern Jiangsu are indeed trying their last struggle, but the National Army is still on the defensive and there are no large-scale battles. It is also heard that the military will soon release accurate news about the various counties in northern Jiangsu (including the actual situation in Yancheng) to set the record straight and dispel public doubts.

### More Than Two Thousand People Surrounded by the National Army; The Communist Army's Attack on Baoding Unsuccessful; Luofa South of Beiping Once Captured Yesterday

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 17th] Military News: The communist army launched an attack on the city walls of Baoding from the west last night. The outer defense forces responded, and fierce fighting continued until this morning. The National Army also surrounded more than 2,000 communist soldiers 18 miles west of Baoding, and they can be annihilated soon.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 16th] Wang Hongshao Talks: The area between Fangshunqiao and Wangdu, south of Baoding, which has long been harassed by the communist army, is now stable. Saidi in eastern Hebei can still be recovered soon. The National Army in southern Hebei is still between Qingfeng and Nanle. Reports of fierce fighting near Dage are not accurate.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 16th] Military News: Luofa Town, west of Gu'an south of Ping, was captured by the communist army at 3:00 this morning. After the National Army counterattacked, it was recovered at 7:00. In addition, Zhugezhuang, near Changxindian, was also attacked by more than 500 communist soldiers last night. The National Army rushed from Ping to rescue them and repelled the communist army.

### The Communist Army in Shandong Forcibly Implements "Immigration Policy"

All Farmland and Houses are Handed Over, Then Re-distributed by the Communist Army

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 16th] The communist army in Shandong Province is now forcibly implementing a so-called "immigration policy." The Taishan Administrative Office of the Communist Army ordered the people of Village A to exchange farmland and houses with the people of Village B. The method is to first hand over everything to the communist army for safekeeping, depriving the people of their autonomy over their land and homes, and then redistribute it by the army. Each person is given two Mu of land to cultivate on their own. When the ordinary people are forced to leave their ancestral homes, they are heartbroken and weep uncontrollably.

### Hell on Earth: Communist Army Ravages Chongli, Chahar; Heart-wrenching Scenes of Extracting Hearts and Disemboweling

[Central News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 16th] Chongli County, Chahar, ninety Huali away from Zhangjiakou, was occupied by the communist army on the 9th of this month and recovered by the National Army on the 12th. During the three days that the communist army occupied it, the devastation was unprecedented. Three days after the recovery, the Zhangjiakou press specially organized an inspection tour to inspect the area. When reporters arrived, although it was three days after the looting, the whole city was still ablaze with smoke and corpses were everywhere. The sound of wailing was incessant. In just one corner of the south of the city, there were more than 400 corpses shot to death by communist army machine guns. After entering the city, the scene was very tragic. Being in it was like being in hell on earth. The number of dead was secondary to the gruesome ways they were killed. Extracting eyes and hearts, disemboweling chests and abdomens, were common occurrences. Some had their lower bodies or anuses cut off by bayonets. The most tragic was one person that the reporter saw nailed to the wall, with his eyes and liver all dug out, and his legs cut off and hung high on nearby branches. There were also those who were tied back-to-back and then stoned to death. Women were mostly stripped naked, had their breasts cut off, and burned to death. Because most of them were burned to ashes, the number could not be counted. It was heard that more than 200 people were burned to death on the first floor of the Catholic Church. Even eighty-year-old elders and months-old infants were not spared. The innocent civilians died so tragically, which is truly outrageous and heartbreaking.

### The Jiaoji Railway is Open to Traffic

One Train Runs Between Ji'nan and Qingdao Daily

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 16th] The Jiaoji Railway began full-line traffic on the 16th.

### The Situation in the Northeast is Still Stable: There Will Not Be a Major War This Winter; The Communist Army Attacking Pulandian Was Repelled

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 16th] Although the situation in the Northeast is sometimes tense and sometimes relaxed, there will not be a large-scale war this winter. According to a military official in charge of the Northeast's current situation: There are still more than 10,000 communist troops in the southern Lushun, Dalian, and Jinzhou areas, and some aircraft received from the Japanese are active in the Jinzhou area. A plane crashed in the Jinzhou area a few days ago. The communist army that attacked Pulandian has now been repelled. Although the Songhua River in the north has frozen over, there is a mobile unit that can cope with attacks from any direction. The communist army north of the Songhua River is quite distressed. There are cases of requisitioning civilian clothing in Harbin and Qiqihar. The strength of the National Army in Jilin seems to have increased, but it is to strengthen defense and should not be seen as any preparations for an attack. In the western Nong'an area, the communist army has repeatedly attacked and been defeated, and the people have suffered a lot. Taonan and Nong'an are the places where the plague originated in the Northeast. I don't know what will happen this winter? In the eastern Andong area, the An-Shen line will be open to traffic soon, and most of the communist troops in the area have been cleared. However, the Communist Party has recently been forcing and wooing the people very harshly. Some areas hope for the National Army but still cannot see it, or they are taking a stronger attitude to deal with the communist army. Therefore, the longer it is delayed, the more profound it will become. This is the trend in some areas in the north and east. In Andong, weapons hidden by the communist army have recently been found in rural areas, because some people are afraid of retaliation from the communist army and dare not report it.

### Tanggu New Port: Lock Gate Trial Navigation

[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 15th] The lock gate of Tanggu New Port held a trial navigation on the 15th. Reporters were invited to visit. At high tide, the water depth of the lock gate can reach 8 meters, enough to accommodate 10,000-ton ships. However, the Hai River does not have this depth. Ships of 3,000 tons can now pass through the lock gate and sail to Tianjin. The trial navigation situation today was very smooth. The Jinxing ship of the engineering bureau entered the gate for trial, adjusted the water level, and exited the gate, taking half an hour in total. The 13-kilometer channel outside the gate was originally excavated to a depth of 6 meters by the Japanese, but it has been silted up by 1.5 meters over the years and needs to be dredged urgently so that 3,000-ton ships can freely enter and exit. The Engineering Bureau plans to complete a throughput of 1 million to 4 million tons per year within three years, and will complete two deep-water berths to accommodate 30,000-ton ships.

Representatives from all walks of life, including the party, government, military, and Wu's former friends and subordinates, respectfully escorted the remains to the base. Public memorial ceremonies were held along the way. The burial took place at 2:00 PM, presided over by Li Zongren on behalf of Chairman Jiang, with He Siyuan, Ma Hongwu, Wu Ren, and Gu Zhongxi accompanying. Wu's wife and son, Daoshi, were extremely saddened. Li Zongren gave a speech on the spot, praising Wu for not being moved by the enemy's threats and inducements during his lifetime and for sacrificing himself for the country. Tiaolin, the abbot of Pude Temple in the western suburbs of Ping, will guard Wu's tomb for two years. Tiaolin was Wu's former staff member, an army colonel, and became a monk in 1935. According to Wu's family, a cemetery will be built for Wu.

### US Troops in Beidaihe, Qinhuangdao: The Departure Date for Troops Stationed in Pingjin and Tanggu Has Not Been Determined

[United Press, Beiping, 16th] US military officials here declared today: The date of the withdrawal of US troops from North China has not yet been determined. Well-informed sources expressed their opinions on Secretary of State Byrnes' recent statement that the mission of the US troops in North China has been completed and orders to return home have been issued, saying that the US troops in Pingjin and Tanggu will not be withdrawn immediately, and may not leave China before next spring. As for the US troops in Beidaihe and Qinhuangdao, they will return home within the next two weeks. According to observers with good sources of information, Byrnes's statement that orders to return home have been issued is carefully worded and consistent with the facts. The First Marine Division in North China was ordered three weeks ago to prepare a withdrawal plan, but it has been revised twice since then. The second revision was made a month ago. Most observers believe that the troops will continue to be stationed in North China until the Beiping Military Mediation Department is dissolved. The current official mission is to maintain the transportation line from Tanggu via Tianjin to Beiping. The unofficial mission is to protect the safety of the US personnel and their families in the Military Mediation Department.

### The Coal Shortage in Changchun is Extremely Serious: Civil Servants Work in Rooms at Minus 25 Degrees Celsius; Representatives from the Press Arrive in Shenyang to Appeal for Assistance from All Walks of Life

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 16th] Changchun is suffering from a coal shortage. Liu Zhu, Shi Wenjin, and Nie Shiqi, representatives from Changchun's press, came to Shenyang to appeal on behalf of the citizens of Changchun. They have now obtained the support of the military and government leaders, who are providing full assistance. Shenyang can send back 75 trucks every day, and Chairman Liang has also agreed to transport a portion from Jilin. In addition, a portion can be transported from Xi'an. In this way, the crisis in Changchun can be alleviated to some extent. Liu and others will return to Changchun on the 17th.

[Another Telegram] Changchun Mayor Zhao Junmai came to Shenyang on the 15th and flew to Pingjing on the 16th to report the situation. Zhao told reporters that the hunger and cold in Changchun are difficult to describe in one word. The 620,000 citizens are currently receiving very little coal. City government officials are working indoors at minus 25 degrees Celsius. If there is no coal relief, the power plant will have no heating and the water pipes will freeze. Factories are also in the same situation. Changchun was the capital of Manchukuo, and tap water is common, resulting in a lack of water wells. If tap water freezes, it will be impossible to dig wells in the severe cold. Without a large amount of coal, unimaginable consequences will occur. Therefore, I am very grateful for the efforts of the press representatives.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 16th] The coal shortage in Changchun and Shenyang is severe. Various railway bureaus are considering completely stopping freight transportation in order to concentrate vehicles and strengthen coal transportation. The Northeast Railway Transportation Coordination Committee will be established soon to be responsible for overall planning. Chen Changjiong, a special envoy of the Ministry of Transportation in the Northeast, will serve as the chairman. All vehicles of various railway bureaus, whether state-owned or belonging to the China Chang Railway, will be uniformly allocated by the committee. 1,350 trucks will be allocated specifically to transport coal from Xi'an, which is expected to transport 1,950 tons per day.

Editorial

### Sino-Siamese Friendship Still Needs Further Development

The name "Siam" was given to this country by the Chinese. Siam was originally the name of two countries, Siam and Luo. Siam evolved from the Ailao Kingdom of the Later Han Dynasty, the Nanzhao Kingdom of the Tang Dynasty, and the Dali Kingdom of the Song Dynasty, and its capital was built in Mengfan. The sound of "Siam" is similar to "Shan," and geographers believe that the Kingdom of Siam may be the Shan Kingdom. Luo was the Kingdom of Lavo, which occupied Zhenla and Sukhothai. In 1317, King Kun Lakhamhaeng of Siam died, and the kingdom's power declined daily. During the Zhizheng era of Emperor Huizong, Lavo annexed Siam. Our imperial court, on the contrary, put the name of the conquered country first, combining them and calling it Siam.

Sino-Siamese relations have a long history. At least 2,000 years ago, there were historical records indicating that relations existed as far back as 1877 years ago, before outsiders invaded Zhenla (Cambodia). Since then, during the Later Han, Liang, Sui, Three Kingdoms, Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, there were tributes in every era. In the eighth year of Tongzhi, tribute was stopped because Siam refused to present tribute with the required ceremonial rites, and contact between the two countries became less frequent.

Geographically, China and Siam seem like one family. Europeans sometimes write "China-Siam" on envelopes when sending letters to Siam. According to a 1937 government census, the population of Siam had reached 14,996,000, of which overseas Chinese numbered over 3 million, accounting for one-quarter of the total population. In fact, most Siamese people today have mixed Chinese blood, especially in political circles, where many people have Chinese ancestry. Siamese elder statesman Phraya Phahon Phonphayuhasena is a prominent example. His ancestral home is in Xiatang Village, Chenghai, Guangdong, and his Chinese name is Chen Jiale. The Siamese ethnic groups include Thai, Lao, Cambodian, and Shan. There are also many Chinese ethnic groups. Except for the Chinese, the rest are all Dai ethnic groups or branches of the Tai ethnic group.

According to the Italian archaeologist C. Gerini, most of the Dai ethnic groups in the three provinces of southern Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi in China today, and the Yi people in southwestern China, are a type of Dai ethnic group and belong to the same system as the Siamese ethnic groups. The dialects in Guangxi, Longzhou, and other places are mostly similar to modern Siamese, and their customs and languages are also very similar, which confirms the difficulty of separating China and Siam.

The Chinese have saved Siam twice. The first time was when King Bang Suzhi of Sukhothai first ascended the throne, and the country was in turmoil. China sent soldiers, warriors, craftsmen, and cannons to quell the rebellion. The second time was in 1767 (the 32nd year of Qianlong) when Zhao Dechen (also known as Zhao or Zheng Xin, where Zhao is the Siamese word for "king" and Xin is the Siamese word for "wealth"), a native of Chaozhou, Guangdong, who served in the Siamese government, single-handedly defeated the Burmese army's invasion and laid the foundation for Siam's freedom and independence.

The evolution of Siamese culture can be divided into three periods: Buddhist culture, Chinese culture, and Europeanization. The cultural trend of the second period changed due to political changes. When Zhao Dechen rose up to restore the country, the Siamese people were in awe of China, and Zhao also promoted this idea. More and more Chinese people came to Siam, and their superior culture was far beyond Siam's reach. As a result, the entire country strived to learn Chinese culture, and Siamese writing and art were all influenced by China, eventually creating a mixed Sino-Siamese civilization.

The world knows that Siam is famous for its four major resources: rice, tin, rubber, and teak, which account for about 80% of its annual exports. However, what is not known is that the development of these major resources was led by overseas Chinese, who shed blood and sweat for them. Today, Siam is able to be self-sufficient and stand independently in Asia. China has indeed not failed Siam, but since Siam stopped paying tribute, it has never been kind to us. In 1920, it banned our overseas Chinese schools, and after the 1932 coup, it implemented a new economic policy, engaging in anti-Chinese activities. In 1939, Phibul Songkhram and Direk Jayanama colluded with the Japanese to change the country's name to Thailand and advocated "Rathaniyom" (Thai nationalism), specifically targeting overseas Chinese as the object of Thai nationalism, using anti-Chinese discrimination as a means of Thai nationalism. When our country's War of Resistance was at a critical juncture, the Siamese authorities flattered Japan and intensified their anti-Chinese activities, hiring Japanese as advisors and enacting twenty-one harsh anti-Chinese regulations. This oppression became tighter and tighter, day by day, leading to the bankruptcy of overseas Chinese businesses, the closure of overseas Chinese schools, and the endangerment of the lives and property of overseas Chinese.

When the motherland won the War of Resistance, the overseas Chinese in Siam did not win victory. On the contrary, they suffered a catastrophe because of the victory, which continued until August 30th. However, China's friendship with others is absolutely not based on "opportunism" or "exploitation." Only friendship based on righteousness and justice can be lasting. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek repeatedly stated in "China's Destiny" that "China's political philosophy is to make the techniques of war and production serve human life," so "during the period of the strong and prosperous Chinese state, Asian nations never experienced economic aggression or political annexation, nor were there any divisions of imperialism and colonies." Just as President Truman said, "The pursuit of security should be the pursuit of common security for the entire world, not the pursuit of security for one country at the expense of threatening the security of the world."

Siam became secure because of the two statements made by Chairman Chiang and President Truman, but our overseas Chinese in Siam are not yet secure. The laws and regulations that hinder overseas Chinese education and economy have not yet been abolished or revised, and the three million overseas Chinese are still living in anxiety. We welcome the new Siamese ambassador to China, Nai Sarawut Durarat, and hope that he can promote further progress in Siamese thinking. Due to the development of science, the Earth has shrunk. Great figures can no longer be trapped in the chauvinistic narrow nationalism. Before this Siamese elder statesman visited China, he told our reporter two proverbs: "A narrow land can be lived on, but a narrow mind is hard to live with." This is worth pondering.

China and Siam are one family, and Sino-Siamese relations are forever inseparable, but our friendship should go further.

### Starting with Peking University's Anniversary

Today is the 48th anniversary of the founding of National Peking University, the anniversary of "Peking University." Originally, in present-day China, the number of universities is already quite large, and many of them are also national universities. The anniversary of a university may not necessarily attract national attention, except for the celebration by the university's faculty and staff. However, the anniversary of Peking University is special. First, historically, Peking University is one of the earliest national universities in modern China. From the Imperial University of Peking to the present, although there have been changes in the interim, it has been passed down in one continuous line and is still the leader of the highest institutions of learning. Second, because Peking University is the only national university in modern China, the teachers and students of Peking University are the backbone of society in China today, spread throughout all levels of the country, and have played a considerable role in modern Chinese society. Therefore, today's anniversary of Peking University is celebrated by people outside Peking University as well. Forty-eight years is an extremely short period in our nation's history, but the past forty-eight years have been a critical juncture in our nation's history. During this period, we have seen the rise and fall of the Japanese Empire and the rebirth of the Chinese nation, defeating Japan's attempted invasion with eight years of long-term resistance. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, National Peking University is celebrating this anniversary during the presidency of Hu Shih. We firmly believe that Peking University in the future will be able to build upon its past glory and develop even further.

When we mention Peking University, no one can forget how the May Fourth Movement, under the leadership of Peking University, pushed forward the high tide of the National Revolution. This is the most meaningful page in the Chinese nation's self-awareness movement and political democracy movement. The impact of this movement on Chinese culture and socio-political life can be said to be unprecedented. Most of the people who participated in this movement are now middle-aged. The vigorous vigor of that year has now subsided. Today, when we commemorate the anniversary of Peking University, we cannot help but feel many emotions. We cannot allow this declining situation to continue. We must find ways to promote and develop the May Fourth spirit, which is the most meaningful measure to commemorate the anniversary of Peking University. What is this May Fourth spirit? It is the pursuit of democracy and freedom. Chinese students played the greatest role during the May Fourth Movement, seemingly echoing the German student movement in the mid-nineteenth century in human history. And in the Chinese student movement at that time, Peking University was undoubtedly in a leading position. The May Fourth Movement has become history, but the spirit of the May Fourth Movement still needs to be developed today. This is the first point that comes to mind when we commemorate the anniversary of Peking University today.

Secondly, Peking University was the only highest institution of learning in the country at that time. Now, universities have been established throughout the country in terms of quantity, but in terms of quality, they are generally declining. Moreover, the purpose of university education itself is becoming increasingly unclear. When Mr. Cai Yuanpei presided over Peking University, he referred to the advantages of universities in continental Europe and the United States, aiming to cultivate generalists. Therefore, he especially emphasized humanities and academic research. The current trend of university education seems to be to create advanced craftsmen, rather than to cultivate generalists, which seems to have lost the original purpose of university education. Universities should focus on independent academic research, not on the transmission of knowledge and skills. Because of the anniversary of Peking University, we feel that it is necessary to re-examine the current university education in our country. We must first recognize the purpose of university education and then seek further reforms. As for the quality of universities, we believe that the increase in quantity will inevitably affect quality. Although the reasons for the decline in the quality of university education today are not simple, the increase in quantity inevitably leads to a decline in quality. Therefore, we believe that it is better to run a small number of universities and improve their quality than to run a large number of universities and allow their quality to decline. The number of famous universities in a country is definitely not large, and the national universities in a country should be on par with the famous universities in other countries in terms of standards.

However, in the current situation in our country, the problems involved in university education in our country at this stage are very broad. There are original interrelationships. The shortage of university funding naturally has a great impact on the development of university education. And the shortage of university funding is caused by the current political and economic situation. But we cannot not think of improving because of the complexity of the relationship. Because of the anniversary of Peking University, we should think about how to refresh our higher education. The long-term stability of the country depends on the relationship of university education. It's really not light; we can't delay another forty-eight years.

### Communist Troops in Shandong Continue to Cause Disturbances. Fellow Villagers from Various Counties in Jinan Appeal for Dispatch of Strong Troops and Allocation of Relief Funds to Alleviate People's Suffering.

(Report from our newspaper in Jinan) The current situation in Shandong Province is about to become serious again as the Communist troops invade from all sides. Moreover, the number of refugees fleeing to this city has continued to increase, crying from hunger and cold, awaiting relief. The United Federation of Fellow Villagers Associations from various counties in Shandong Province in Jinan, under this major situation, convened a joint meeting of directors and supervisors of various administrative regions on the 12th to discuss countermeasures. The following is a summary of the resolved matters: (1) As the Communist troops are currently invading from all sides, the situation in Shandong Province has turned tense again, all unanimously advocated to send telegrams separately to the National Government Chiang Chairman, Ministry of National Defense Bai Minister. Chief of Staff Chen, and Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters Director Xue, appealing for the dispatch of strong troops into Shandong to protect the results of reconstruction and alleviate the suffering of the people of Shandong. (2) The Relief and Relief Committee previously issued 300 million yuan of emergency relief funds, but some counties have not been issued because of delayed application or unclear procedures. It was decided to send another letter requesting that all existing relief funds be re-distributed according to the number of refugees currently in this city. Moreover, as the committee is a province-wide relief agency and this association is a province-wide mass organization, it is proposed to publicly recommend several representatives to participate in the committee to contribute relief opinions. (3) The small loans for refugees previously organized by the Shandong Provincial Bank were not fair to all counties, and the procedures were complicated, causing difficulties for the refugees. It was decided to publicly recommend several representatives to go to the bank to ask for the average lending to be distributed to all counties and to simplify the procedures. (4) It was decided to send telegrams to the national representatives of this province in Beijing, requesting the government, and to send telegrams to fellow villagers associations in Pinghu and other places, appealing for a large amount of relief funds to tide over the winter. (5) The Jinan Municipal Government was requested to impose an additional 20% refugee donation on restaurants, restaurants and various entertainment venues to expand relief. (6) The Shandong Repair and Defense Office of the Yellow River Commission was requested to resume the project and adopt a work-for-relief method for relief, and refugees from various counties should have priority. (7) The Peiyang Grand Theater was requested to perform a charity drama, and all ticket prices were used to help refugees. (8) The Rescue and Relief Administration was requested to issue return travel expenses to refugees in the recovered counties who volunteered to return to their hometowns, provided that they had proof from the fellow villagers association in their county, to facilitate relief and benefit reconstruction.

### Densely Populated Counties in Southern Jiangsu to Reorganize Jia with Thirty Households Each and Expand Township Staffing with Designated Funding

(Report from our newspaper in Zhenjiang) The Jiangsu Provincial Government convened a meeting with the Commissioners of the first, second, and third districts on the 13th to strengthen the efficiency of local administrative work in the counties south of the Yangtze River. The main points of the discussion are recorded below: (1) Regarding county funds, they will be divided into two parts: A. Funds above the district level will be included in the county budget, and expenditures will be based on income. The budget will be prepared based on the actual situation of each county, and the county magistrate and finance section chief will be convened by the provincial government to discuss it. It must meet the actual needs of the local area, and a reserve fund should be listed, and the living expenses of employees should be considered, so that they can be paid on time. B. Funds below the district level will be raised by themselves. The funds for the township offices will be 1.5 million yuan per month, and the office expenses for the Bao will be 100,000 yuan per month. The county government and the County Provisional Assembly will decide on the amount, and the township people's representatives will approve it. The amount will be collected at one time, handed over to the county government, and distributed on a monthly basis. C. The expenses for the central national schools and self-defense teams in the townships, which are not included in the budget, will be collected according to the previous principles. (2) The township Baojia system will be reorganized. The past decimal system is not entirely suitable. Because the counties south of the Yangtze River are densely populated, it has been decided to change the organization to thirty households per Jia, thirty Jia per Bao, and thirty Bao per township, so as to concentrate manpower, material resources, and financial resources. (3) The township and Bao chiefs should be selected carefully, and traitors should not be appointed. (4) The local self-defense forces should be concentrated in the district to avoid dispersion. (5) The organization of the county security team should have three or four companies, based on the principle of being able to protect local security. Those with less than two companies must not establish a brigade headquarters. (6) The cadre training institutes in each county must be prepared and opened for training immediately. The training period can be shortened from one month to two weeks to avoid affecting business. (7) The price of military grain rice in each county must be 17,800 yuan per stone, including transportation costs, according to the purchase price stipulated by the central government.

### The Plague in Southern Zhejiang Has Not Been Eradicated, A Poisonous Legacy of the Enemy Spreading Germs from the Air Several Years Ago

[Our Newspaper Hangzhou Report] This year, various counties in southern Zhejiang Province, such as Yongjia, Ruian, Lishui, Yunhe, Quzhou, and other places, have successively experienced outbreaks of plague, occurring intermittently and failing to be completely eradicated. According to the person in charge of the Provincial Health Department speaking to our newspaper reporter, during the years of the Republic, the enemy Japanese used aircraft to dissolve germs in flour and scatter it in Quzhou and Ningbo. As a result, plague outbreaks occurred in these two counties. Fortunately, the authorities in Ningbo took decisive measures to burn down the affected areas, thus eradicating the plague. Quzhou's response was slower, and the infection spread more severely. By the 31st year, the enemy had fled, and Quzhou was severely damaged, thus the plague subsided. However, the counties invaded from northern Fujian, such as Qingyuan and Yunhe, and even Lishui and Yongjia, suffered greatly. This year, more than 200 people have died from the plague, with Yongjia being the worst affected. The local authorities are now being ordered to actively take preventive measures, otherwise, the plague will rage rampantly next spring.

He asked where the grain funds were stored, and Secretary Zhao of the office pointed to a safe. However, Deputy Director Luo was not present as he had gone to the countryside with County Magistrate Xu to supervise the collection of grain, and Deputy Director Luo had taken the key. Therefore, it could not be opened for inspection. Director Ouyang then sealed it with a seal, and then opened it for inspection together with Director Wu, secretary of the District Procuratorate. To everyone's surprise, there was only one pistol in the safe, and no money was stored there. This caused great suspicion, and the office's account books were requisitioned and sealed for auditing.

### Huai River Guidance Committee Surveys the Shaobo Canal Levee and Sluice Gate

[Our Newspaper Yangzhou Report] The Shaobo Canal levee and ship lock within the boundaries of the Seventh District of this county were contracted and built by the pre-war Huai River Guidance Committee. The scale of its grandeur and the perfection of its equipment are the only modern engineering marvels of its kind in the country. After the Incident, it was severely damaged by the enemy.

### Letter

Editor: I recently read a report in your newspaper about the fire in Huangyan, which does not conform to the facts. The writer was in Huangyan at the time and knows the truth of the matter: On the night of the 8th of this month, at 2:30 AM, a fire broke out in a cotton batting shop due to careless smoking during gambling. The wind was very strong that night, and it was impossible to put out the fire. It burned for about three hours before it was extinguished. It is estimated that one elderly person who could not walk died, and only more than 100 houses were destroyed (the fire started at the entrance of Siting Lane, extending south along the main street to the entrance of Si Hou Lane, and north to the south of Qiaotingtou). Your newspaper's report that nearly half of the city was destroyed and hundreds of infants were burned to death is inaccurate. Please correct it as above.

### West · Lake · Snow · Attire

— Hangzhou Report Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng

On December 11, 35th year of the Republic, the world-famous West Lake put on its snowy attire. According to people who have not left Hangzhou in recent years, such continuous snowfall all day long in winter is rare in the last decade. Even last year, the first winter after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, everyone thought that auspicious snow would come with the victory, but West Lake was not allowed to put on its white attire, so that the tourists who had been away for nine years could admire it.

Ugliness Is All Covered Up

The heavy snow on the 11th really covered up the ugliness of this garden city that is under construction, leaving only the pure white beauty, which is really a beautiful park. Looking out from the lakefront, the many mountains surrounding West Lake seem to be closer. On Su Causeway and Bai Causeway, the withered branches and leaves have been piled into white flower balls. The Little Yingzhou of Three Pools Mirroring the Moon, the Huxin Pavilion, Ruan Gong Dun, and the Memorial Tower of the Exposition have become four large white balls of different shapes in the lake. Baochu Pagoda and Baochu Mountain are like giant silver cauldrons. The few proud chrysanthemums in the Lakeside Park are still fighting against the snow, but they are eventually painted white. Perhaps only the plums on Solitary Hill can take advantage of this heavy snowfall to sprout and bud quickly. Sure enough, some wealthy people went to Broken Bridge to enjoy the snow, and some rented boats on the lakefront, because they were piled with snow, the desolate and lonely situation was decorated away. The boats, the begging beggars, the fortune tellers on Chenghuang Mountain, and the prostitutes on Yingshi Street have all disappeared. The quiet and comfortable West Lake certainly showed purity and nobility at that time.

Whiteness Is Just A Craving

Unfortunately, snow is not flour, nor cotton, let alone silver that can be exchanged. It cannot provide warmth and fullness to the poor people on the entire West Lake. This kind of giving is fake, and it will soon pass away. When it passes away, all the ugliness will be exposed again. Therefore, snow is fundamentally perfunctory. It just comes like this, letting people crave this whiteness, hope for this light, but all the corruption is still growing under its whiteness! If you don't believe me, a group of children from the orphanage, braving the wind and snow, running barefoot on the snow to find another group of children from the orphanage, resulted in twelve children being recruited into their team. In addition, cotton clothes and flour are exactly what the poor people are tremblingly demanding, but such a good opportunity to "send charcoal in the snow" to donate clothes and flour on the 11th was missed. Is it necessary to show kindness again in the hot sun? "Helping the poor is like fighting a fire." I hope you don't delay the procedures any longer, quickly investigate the situation, and give it to them urgently. Don't just spend your time planning how to write the report!

Recently, the Zhejiang Branch of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration replaced old clothes with cotton cloth for public servants and teachers. It was very crowded. Seven or eight people fell into the water because of the crowd, and one person fell into a pit, but still could not get a satisfactory result. We Chinese are negligent, and we also like petty advantages. Under the influence of these two fundamental natures, we have lost the unfortunate events that have occurred, even though several newspapers are clamoring and shouting.

After This Heavy Snow

After this heavy snow, I am afraid that illegal events will increase in this severe winter. In the past, according to the statistics for November, the most illegal events were similar to gambling, confusion, obstruction of traffic, and obstruction of others' physical freedom. Hangzhou Southeast Daily used "So Hangzhou!" as the title, asking readers to look at the statistics of illegal cases, but in this ice-like severe winter, there is no way to reduce the above events, and the poor who are plagued by hunger and cold, what will they need, will naturally be listed as another case in illegal cases.

The stores, in this heavy snow, still encouraged the courage they could no longer encourage, turned on the neon lights, and used the wireless radio to call out with all their strength, but the shopkeepers bent their backs, tightened their hands, and had nothing to do. This is the eve of the collapse in the midst of the commercial depression. Only the usurers light a fire in this storm, and embrace girls to play, but their fate is already doomed. If they kill all the objects of their loans, they will only fall down and perish together.

Auspicious Snow Foretells a Good Harvest!

A more agreeable sentence is "Auspicious snow foretells a good harvest." Yes, this snow froze all the pests. But the old farmers in the countryside, who are already burdened, cannot lift the enthusiasm of "Auspicious snow foretells a good harvest." In recent years, the money earned from hard work in the countryside has all flowed out, becoming floating capital, and it has also become high interest, which once again exploits the countryside. The use of land is limited, and people's energy is also limited. Moreover, the population in the countryside is gradually escaping from the countryside. The blood of the countryside is about to be drained. People in the cities, what are they talking about "Auspicious snow foretells a good harvest"? Recently, agricultural products have been picked out of the countryside, and there has been heavy exploitation. Layers of profits have been added, but the countryside has not benefited, the farmers have not benefited, only some intermediate bloodsuckers have grown fat. Therefore, under the "Auspicious Snow", pork has become more expensive, vegetables have become more expensive, eggs have become more expensive, and even green onions, garlic, and tofu have become more expensive. We want to examine the profits after these price increases. If they really benefit the farmers, it is also appropriate. It is a pity that these profits make the final recipients turn around and do high-interest buying and selling.

Please Return To The Countryside

In today's West Lake, today's Hangzhou City, it can be said that most of it still relies on the countryside to nourish it. If we ignore this point, then this beautiful West Lake will also wither and decline. Therefore, in this severe winter, we have reason to ask some people who are shouting for winter relief, people who are preparing large amounts of flour and cotton clothing for relief. If they have not found the poor, please go to the countryside near Pillow City to investigate and donate. If the poor in the city want to ask why they especially value the countryside? We can ask them to go back to the countryside to work, so as not to be idle in the city.

Those banks and money houses with magnificent decorations in the large foreign buildings, please take a break from the city loans! Quickly lend money to the countryside to nourish the countryside, and don't let it out for people to do high-interest loans! Because the banks and money houses themselves are going to be in trouble!

Wake Up The Garden City

Silver, flour, and cotton are all symbolized by snow. "Auspicious snow foretells a good harvest." Perhaps next year can make the social situation better, but looking at our countryside, there is really nothing to grasp. We must urgently wake up the people in this garden city and pay close attention to the development of the countryside near this city. [12th]

### The Indian Interim Government Is Considering Declaring Independence Within Three Days. Nehru Claims That Britain Cannot Interfere in India's Internal Affairs. Britain Insists That Indian-Muslim Cooperation Is a Prerequisite for Independence.

[United Press India Pinars 15th] Nehru, Vice-Chairman of the Indian Interim Government, declared here today: India will declare separation from the British Empire within three days. The constitution decided by the Indian Constituent Assembly will not be submitted to the British Parliament for approval. We no longer expect anything from London and have decided to solve the problem ourselves. The Congress Party has decided to move forward bravely. Britain is unable to prevent Indian independence. The leaders of the Islamic League are reactionaries who do not want India to be free and only follow Britain's lead. Britain may want India to stand up and maintain power in the separation of India and Muslims, creating various difficulties.

[United Press London 16th] British sources said today: Unless the Islamic League participates in the Indian government, Britain will not accept the Indian independence plan. Nehru, Chairman of the Indian Interim Government, recently said that India will declare its separation from Britain within three days, but the British side mainly believes that the Islamic League must participate in the interim government for Indian independence. No matter what Nehru personally declares, Britain's position will not change. The Indian Affairs Department refused to comment on Nehru's statement, and refused to discuss what would happen if the Indian Parliament passed a bill declaring independence.

[Agence France-Presse New Delhi 15th] Nehru, Vice-Chairman of the Indian Interim Government and Minister of Foreign Affairs, has aroused negative reactions from the Indian Council of Aristocrats after submitting a draft resolution at the Constituent Assembly some days ago. According to a public statement issued by the committee of the Aristocratic Council responsible for negotiating with the Constituent Assembly: Vice-Chairman Nehru has proposed a draft resolution on the ten basic issues at the preliminary meeting of the Constituent Assembly. This committee is deeply regretful. The Constituent Assembly cannot and should not consider or decide on these basic issues before the provinces of India have sent representatives, and before the committees of the provinces have negotiated with the British-Indian group committee of the Constituent Assembly. It is obvious that the basic issues proposed in the draft resolution should be discussed by the representatives of the provinces of India when drafting a constitution that can be accepted by the entire country.

[Agence France-Presse London 15th] The Labour Party's Rheinhold News recently published an article severely criticizing the speech made by former Prime Minister Churchill in the Lower House. The article said: "The Lower House has been discussing the Indian issue for two days. The Conservative Party's failure to adopt a constructive policy on the major issues related to the empire facing the parliament has been fully exposed. Churchill himself and the Indian people who hope to lead the country must understand that since the Labour Party government can be supported by the people of the whole country, it must seek to implement the greatest liberation action in history with determination. There are great difficulties in transferring power by peaceful means, but the Labour Party government does not secretly hope for its failure because of difficulties, and hopes to overcome these difficulties through consultations and compromises with great patience. This is the first time that Britain has such a government in the relationship between Britain and India.

### The First UN General Assembly Achieved Great Success. Spaak Delivered the Closing Speech. The General Assembly Decided to Establish an International Refugee Organization. Thailand Was Approved to Join as the 55th Member State.

[Agence France-Presse New York 15th] The Chairman of the United Nations General Assembly, Spaak, said in his closing speech today: "The General Assembly has come to a successful conclusion today. When you return home, you can convey a message full of confidence and hope to your government and people. The General Assembly has passed many important cases, and the disarmament resolution is the most important. The courage of the Soviet delegation to raise this issue, and the courage of other delegations to follow, is commendable. Apart from the Franco issue, there is no more important issue than the international disarmament resolution. If the agencies responsible for implementing this resolution can succeed, the world will enter a new era. The United Nations is more advanced than the old League of Nations. When I was in Geneva in the past, I often felt that I was among diplomats, but here I feel that I am among politicians. The United Nations has become the parliament of the world." Secretary-General of the United Nations, Lai Yi, continued to speak, saying that we have indeed witnessed the birth of the world parliament here. We feel that the signs of peace are stronger than ever before. Lai Yi thanked Chairman Spaak, the delegations of the United Nations, the press, and the Secretariat of the United Nations, and strongly stated that the democratic principles displayed in the General Assembly have been used to the greatest extent. The representatives of various countries and groups have almost all made some concessions to seek compromises for the happiness of the world. Although we cannot over-praise the General Assembly, due to the conscience and goodwill of all parties, we have achieved results that we did not dare to expect before.

[Agence France-Presse New York 15th] The UN General Assembly held a closing meeting today and discussed a number of issues, including the election of Thailand as a member of the United Nations and the establishment of an international refugee organization. The General Assembly also elected Uruguay as the eighth member state of the Special Committee, which is responsible for studying the reports submitted by the trusteeship countries to the UN Secretariat. US representative Mrs. Roosevelt gave an impassioned appeal for refugees, pleading with the General Assembly to do everything possible to prevent one million refugees from falling into the abyss of misery and loneliness. Soviet representative Gromyko refused to have anything to do with this agency, claiming that the agency did not emphasize the greatest importance of repatriating refugees, but instead encouraged refugees in refugee camps to conduct propaganda against their motherland. The meeting adjourned at 8:30 PM and reopened seven minutes later, immediately passing the establishment of the International Refugee Organization with a majority of 25 votes to 5, with 8 abstentions. The five dissenting votes were cast by Slavic countries. The General Assembly also decided that the refugee agency would be located in Paris or Geneva. The original proposal only mentioned Paris, but the British representative proposed an amendment, arguing that it would be beneficial for the agency to be located near the headquarters of the International Red Cross. The General Assembly then elected Thailand as a member state without encountering any obstacles, and the country will be able to attend the next General Assembly. The last item on the agenda was the proposal by Ukraine that the next UN General Assembly should be held in a European country instead of New York. When this proposal was put to debate, the British representative expressed support, while the Soviet representative opposed it. As a result, it was decided that the next General Assembly would still be held in New York in September next year.

### Gu Weijun Expressed His Thoughts on the General Assembly

[Our Newspaper Special Correspondent New York 16th] Dr. Gu Weijun, the chief representative of China to the General Assembly, told reporters after the closing of the General Assembly that the breadth and importance of the agenda of this General Assembly was unprecedented in any previous international conference. All resolutions are very important and extremely progressive, containing a spirit of freedom, and will surely promote unprecedented cooperation, shining brightly for the future happiness of mankind.

[Agence France-Presse New York 15th] US delegation leader Austin delivered a farewell speech today before the closing of the General Assembly, saying: "There is only one thing in world history that can be compared to this General Assembly. It is a special honor for the United Nations to hold a meeting in New York and choose New York as its permanent headquarters. Eight weeks ago, the General Assembly opened in an atmosphere of hope and fear, but now it has passed all the tests, and I believe that we have achieved the important goals of the United Nations." Austin then emphasized the importance of the control system and disarmament, and finally thanked Chairman Spaak and UN Secretary-General Lai Yi.

### Molotov Praises Achievements of Foreign Ministers' Conference

[French News Agency, Moscow, 16th] Foreign Minister Molotov, before embarking on a ship from New York to return home, made a statement to a Soviet radio interviewer, expressing satisfaction with the achievements of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference in New York. He also expressed his strong belief that next year's Moscow meeting would yield the best results. Mr. Molotov expressed his gratitude to the American people for the welcome extended to him and the Soviet delegation. When Mr. Molotov touched on the United Nations General Assembly's disarmament resolution, he called it one of the most important plans of the assembly.

### General Disarmament Issue Handed Over to Security Council for Handling

[Reuters, New York, 15th] The UN General Assembly passed a resolution last night advocating immediate measures to ban atomic bombs and other weapons of mass destruction. UN experts are now preparing the first steps for actual disarmament. Responsible parties remain cautious, advising against excessive optimism, but military and scientific experts from several countries will begin working on the extremely complex disarmament issue this week. The issue will be handed over to the Security Council by the General Assembly. At the same time, the Atomic Energy Commission is holding closed meetings on schedule and will soon draft an important report to be submitted to the Security Council around the end of this month. How all these activities can lead to concrete results is still unpredictable today.

### Franco Still Does Not Know Repentance, Calls on People to Cope with Crisis

[United Press, Zaragoza, Spain, 15th] Franco delivered two defiant speeches to a crowd of 100,000 people today, pointing out that the world is in a state of war and could declare war at any time. He said that as long as materialistic views of life continue to exist in the world, where dishonesty and hypocrisy are commonplace, and adherence to agreements has become a relic of the past, such a situation will inevitably lead to war. A new Pearl Harbor event is not the bombing of naval fleets in harbors or the use of atomic bombs to attack cities and industries, but the fifth column of internal treachery. These people have dual nationalities, one visible on the outside and one hidden on the inside, and they will undermine our system. Foolish and lifeless democracies are willingly opening the door to let wolves into their homes. Franco's speech did not directly address the resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly to recall ambassadors to Spain.

[Reuters, Madrid, 15th] Franco, speaking to the crowd at the graduation ceremony of the Zaragoza Sergeant School today, said that Spain must be prepared to deal with everything, that cherishing peace is not enough, and that we must be prepared to defend it. Recently, armed groups and terrorists have frequently invaded the Spanish border from a certain country, while border officials of that country turn a blind eye. Spain has never been defeated directly by frontal assault; its failures have always been due to internal divisions. Their enemies often say that they will allow the Spanish people to fail on their own, so we must unite, he said.

### Greek Guerrilla Leaders Put Forward Nine Armistice Conditions, Fierce Fighting Underway in Western Thrace District

[United Press, Belgrade, 15th] The leaders of the guerrilla forces in Aegean and Macedonia, Greece, today denied the accusation by Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris that the guerrilla forces intend to establish independence and autonomy. They said that the guerrilla forces only want to establish a "Greek Democratic Army" to confront Tsaldaris' "terrorism and one-party dictatorship." The Deputy Chief of Staff of the guerrilla forces, using the alias Karfa, said today that the guerrilla forces submitted a memorandum to the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom on the 24th of last month, requesting the organization of a joint delegation to investigate the truth in the guerrilla area. Karfa promised to cooperate, saying that he had inspected the rear of the guerrilla forces with reporters from various countries for three days and had submitted a detailed report on the results to the United Nations Secretariat. The guerrilla forces have put forward nine armistice conditions, and if these conditions are not accepted, civil war will continue in Greece. The nine conditions are as follows: (1) Amnesty for political prisoners. (2) British troops are the cause of all the evils of the Greek government and should withdraw from Greece. (3) Recognition of wartime resistance achievements. (4) Resistance personnel participate in the government. (5) Equal rights for democrats and monarchists. (6) Punishment of pro-enemy fascists during the occupation era. (7) Purge pro-enemy elements in the military and political systems. (8) Organize an army that truly represents the country. (9) Re-election. Karfa also stated that his command has no relationship with the Greek left-wing army and the Macedonian "National Liberation Front," but the majority of the guerrilla soldiers previously belonged to these two organizations. Karfa did not announce the strength of his troops, only saying that every mountain is controlled by the guerrilla forces, a statement that has been confirmed by British military intelligence.

[French News Agency, Istanbul, Turkey, 15th] According to a dispatch from a correspondent of a local newspaper stationed in northern Greece from Istanbul: Fierce fighting has been taking place between the Greek government forces and the guerrilla forces in the Maricha area near Salonica in western Thrace for five days, and the fighting is still ongoing. The situation there is very serious. The guerrillas have now controlled several villages in the mountains. Railway traffic and postal services from Salonica to Istanbul have been cut off. The activities of the guerrilla forces in the Salonica area have increased unabated, distributing leaflets everywhere, urging people to join the guerrilla forces.

### UN Rejects Greek Request, Greeks Observe Day of Mourning

[Reuters, Athens, 15th] The Greek Labor Pan-Hellenic Committee today ordered its members to observe this Wednesday as a day of mourning to show opposition to the UN General Assembly's rejection of Greece's demands regarding the Bulgarian border, and asked Greek shops and offices to close for five hours, and Greek churches to ring bells and turn off lights for five minutes.

### Important British Documents Missing

### Dense Electronic Cloud Layer Discovered at High Altitude

[United Press, Washington, 15th] Scientists, discussing the discovery of an electronic cloud layer in the upper atmosphere of the Earth by the Carnegie Institution, said today that the air of the entire Earth is gradually being polluted by gas, which is obvious near industrial centers and in the oceans adjacent to industrial centers, and is also quite dense around airplanes passing over the ocean.

The mall was once burned down when the Japanese army invaded Manila in 1945.

### Iranian Government Achieves Great Victory, Kurdish Leader Also Surrenders

Martial Law in Various Provinces to Be Lifted Soon

[United Press, Black Customs, 15th] The Iranian Ministry of the Army issued a communiqué today stating: "The leader of the Kurdish Republic," Mahamet, surrendered to the government forces after a fierce battle, allowing the government to take over more parts of the Azerbaijani semi-autonomous region. The republic governed the western part of Azerbaijan, in accordance with the ceasefire agreement established with the separatist faction of Great Britain. With Mr. Ma's surrender, the matter will naturally come to an end. The troops of the separatist faction Bishi Fari have already surrendered to the government.

[Reuters, Tehran, 15th] It was announced here tonight that after the entry of the central government forces into the province of Azerbaijan, the martial law and curfew orders in many places in the province will be lifted in order to hold elections, but when they will be held has not been specified. Tehran Radio announced tonight that the entire province of Azerbaijan has returned to peace and tranquility, and people can freely go to various places. The central government announced that Imami, a right-wing member of parliament from Azerbaijan, was ordered to be released by the prime minister last night.

[This Newspaper] London, 16th, Broadcasting from Tehran: The "Societal" Party re-entered the political arena and issued a declaration today, advocating a peaceful solution to the Azerbaijan issue and accusing reactionary factions of attempting to destroy Iran's democratic politics by exploiting the Azerbaijan incident.

[French News Agency, Tehran, 15th] The Iranian Minister of Propaganda and Labor, Farmeian, recently declared at a press conference: Although officials have not yet been able to confirm the rumors that Bishi Fari, the leader of the Democratic Party of Azerbaijan Province, and other leaders of the party have fled abroad, if such rumors are true, the Iranian government will demand their extradition in accordance with international law.

### Philippine Government to Set Up Commercial Center in Shanghai

[Reuters, Manila, 16th] There is currently a strong movement in semi-official and private business circles to establish Philippine commercial organizations in various central points around the world, including Shanghai, in order to promote Philippine overseas commerce. Furthermore, in view of the government's promotion of foreign trade activities becoming increasingly widespread, it is now proposed to establish a separate Ministry of Commerce. Currently, agricultural and commercial activities are all handled by the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce.

Chinese Sugar Merchants Expelled

[Reuters, Manila, 16th] The Director of the Philippine Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, Coscorula, has asked President Roxas to expel ten Chinese merchants because they sold four thousand bags of sugar frozen by the administration for requisition. The government has transferred this case to the Bureau of Expulsion for handling.

Crackdown on Overseas Chinese Stalls

[Central News Agency, Manila, 15th] According to Order No. 32 recently promulgated by the Philippine Department of Finance, the stalls in the Manila market will be "cleaned out" on January of next year and stalls will be rented to vendors under the following conditions. First, all stalls operated by Filipinos must reapply before December 31 of this year; second, all stalls owned by foreigners must apply before December 28. In order to restrict stalls operated by foreigners, the order stipulates, "All stalls not operated by Filipinos before December 31, if applied for by Filipinos, shall be rented to the first applicant." It seems that although our overseas Chinese stall vendors can nominally reapply to continue to maintain their stalls, the actual opportunity is very slim.

### Philippine Transport Plane Crashes, Twelve Passengers Die

[United Press, Manila, 16th] Officials of the Far Eastern Air Transport Company announced today that in the 0.47 plane named "Manila Girl" that crashed on Mount Banahaw in southern Luzon last Saturday, twelve people died and two were injured.

Colonel Vila Mau, Director of the Philippine Government Meteorological Bureau, is currently inspecting the crash site.

### Blum Forms Pure Socialist Cabinet, One Says to Expand Cabinet Base, French President to Be Elected Early Next Year

[French News Agency, Paris, 15th] Fortizio, Chief Secretary to the Speaker of the National Assembly, Orivo, told the press that if the various parties are unwilling to participate in the new cabinet, then Prime Minister Blum will form a pure Socialist cabinet so that the list of cabinet members can be submitted to the National Assembly the day after tomorrow. The Popular Republican Movement and the Leftist Assembly Movement are studying the proposals put forward by Prime Minister Blum. The success or failure of cabinet formation depends largely on the attitude of these two political parties. At 9:45 PM today, Blum met with representatives of the Popular Republican Movement, and then at 10:20 PM, he also met with representatives of the Leftist Assembly Movement. Afterwards, it was only learned that these two political parties will still hold meetings tonight to discuss, so the cabinet is still feared to not be formed by tomorrow morning.

[French News Agency, Paris, 15th] The newly appointed Prime Minister Blum continued to consult with the leaders of various parties today on the formation of a cabinet. Blum himself intends to expand the government's base. In addition to the three major political parties, he will also recruit the Leftist Assembly Movement and right-wing political parties into the cabinet. However, the Communist Party believes that Blum's permission for right-wing parties to enter the cabinet is a major mistake. If Blum's proposal can be agreed upon by the various parties, a Minister of National Defense will be added, to be assumed by the Communist Party. As for the three ministers of the Navy, Army, and Air Force, they will be assumed by the Popular Republican Movement, the Radical Socialist Party, and the Independent Republican Party respectively. In addition, the Minister of Industrial Production will be divided into two departments: Industrial Production and Industrial Distribution. The Minister of Production will be assumed by the Communist Party, and the Minister of Distribution will belong to the Popular Republican Movement. Therefore, the allocation of candidates for the new cabinet is as follows: (1) Socialist Party—In addition to the position of Prime Minister, it will also retain the five ministerial positions of the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of National Economy, the Ministry of Colonies, the Ministry of Public Works, and the Ministry of Education. (2) Popular Republican Movement—It will be awarded the six ministerial positions of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Household Registration, the Ministry of the Army, and the Ministry of Industrial Distribution. (3) Communist Party—It will retain the six ministerial positions of the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Industrial Production, the Ministry of Labor, the Ministry of Reconstruction, the Ministry of Public Health, and the Ministry of Veterans. (4) Leftist Assembly Movement—It will have the four ministerial positions of the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Food, the Ministry of the Navy, and the Ministry of Posts. In addition, the Communist Party, the Popular Republican Movement, and the Leftist Assembly Movement each have one State Councilor.

[French News Agency, Paris, 15th] The President of the French Fourth Republic is scheduled to be elected in January of next year.

### American Missionaries Set Off for the Far East

[United Press, San Francisco, 16th] Six hundred and seventy American missionaries will embark on the transport ship "Sea Lynx" here today for various parts of the Far East.

### Far East International Tribunal Indicts Japanese Atrocities, Tojo and Others Bear Full Responsibility for Heinous Crimes

[This Newspaper's Special Correspondent in Tokyo, 16th] When the Japanese war crimes tribunal continued to try former Prime Minister Tojo and his 26 accomplices today, the British prosecutor accused the Japanese wartime cabinet of bearing full responsibility for the massacre and mutilation of more than 100,000 people in Southeast Asia. At the same time, former Japanese Army Commander in Burma Kimura Heitaro should also bear the responsibility for executing Allied pilots captured by the Japanese army without trial. It is said that 25 percent of British civilians and military personnel captured by the Japanese army were killed or died of illness in detention.

[United Press, Tokyo, 16th] The Far East International Military Tribunal launched the final stage of indictment against Japanese war criminals today. Australian Frenchman Mansfield pointed out that Tojo and 12 others were directly responsible for Japanese atrocities against Allied prisoners of war, interned civilians, and people in Japanese-occupied areas. Mansfield said that similar abuses that occurred throughout the Japanese-occupied areas were not individual actions of Japanese officers and soldiers, but a general policy of the Japanese army and government. The prosecution will present evidence to prove that the Japanese army completely disregarded international law in the occupied areas. The Japanese have repeatedly stated that the treatment of prisoners of war will be carried out in accordance with the Japanese code of law, and prisoners of war have no rights. Mansfield listed the following as directly responsible for the atrocities besides Tojo: (1) Kimura, Vice Minister of the Army in Tojo's cabinet, (2) Muto, former Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of the Army, (3) Sato, former Chief of the Prisoner Management Section of the Military Affairs Bureau, (4) Togo, former Minister of Foreign Affairs, (5) Shigemitsu, former Minister of Foreign Affairs, (6) Nagano, former Commander of the Combined Fleet, (7) Shimada, former Minister of the Navy, (8) Utsu, former Commander of the Kwantung Army, (9) Potan, former Commander of the Japanese Army in the Singapore area, (10) Kanemitsu, Director of the Planning Bureau in Tojo's cabinet, (11) Oka, former Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of the Navy.

### Economic Crisis Deepens, Anti-Cabinet Movement Expands in Japan

[Remodeling Society, Tokyo, 16th] The Supreme Struggle Committee of the General Federation of Employees' Unions of Japanese National Railways held a meeting in the conference room of the Ministry of Transportation this morning to discuss participating in the National Anti-Cabinet Congress and the winter living subsidy issue jointly with the National Council of Labor Unions of Government and Public Enterprises.

It was also decided that trains, ships, factories, etc., would sound their whistles in unison at 10:00 AM on the day of the National Anti-Cabinet Congress.

[Remodeling Society, Tokyo, 16th] Japanese Socialist Party members in parliament have emphasized that Japan's economy will face a crisis in April of next year. State Minister Zen has also frankly admitted that this is based on inflation and rising prices. Because the Japanese government has submitted a supplementary budget of 5.2 billion yen for this year's extraordinary session of parliament, and there will be a huge additional budget of nearly 10 billion yen successively submitted, the total budget for this year will exceed the 70 billion yen mark.

### Japanese Police Will Use Electricity to Interrogate Criminals, Can Detect Whether Confession Is a Lie

[Remodeling Society, Tokyo, 16th] The Tokyo police are planning to use wireless electricity to test whether the statements made by criminals are true during confidential interrogations. Because if a criminal tells a lie during interrogation, he will inevitably feel uneasy or his blood pressure circulation will change. The electrical current sensed by the machine from his body can detect that he is lying. Japan already had this design during the war and has now completed the testing. The police have ordered a batch of "criminal lie detectors" from wireless electricity manufacturing companies, and each branch will be equipped with one for interrogating criminals.

### Mei Lanfang Invited to Perform in Japan

[United Press, Tokyo, 16th] Kyodo News Agency reported today: Chinese famous actor Mei Lanfang, at the invitation of MacArthur, will perform a famous play at the Eni Pare Theater in Tokyo on New Year's Day.

### The Holy See Rebukes Divorce

[Reuters, Rome, 15th] Both the Roman Catholic Church and Italian civil law mentioned the issue of divorce today, which is a topic that has long been debated. The official declaration of the Holy See was recently published in Rome. The document rebukes divorce in strong terms, which greatly surprised the Italian political circles who oppose it.

### The United States Is Likely to Experience the Largest Strike Wave

[United Press, Washington, 15th] The President of the American Industrial Organizations Association, Morey, issued a statement recently, accusing the American Manufacturers Association and the American Chamber of Commerce of reactionary behavior, saying that the current surplus of merchants is the "plunder of postwar speculators," and demanded a comprehensive increase in wages in all industries. Well-informed sources close to the government expect that the largest strike wave in history is likely to occur soon. At the same time, the major labor unions of the Industrial Organizations Association in various parts of the United States are preparing to launch a second large-scale movement to demand wage increases.

### British Donation to Aid China Fund

[French News Agency, New Delhi, 15th] The Chairman of the British Aid China Fund Committee, Mrs. Cripps, the Minister of Commerce, recently said here to the press as a guest of Mrs. Nehru, the Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the Indian Interim Government, that the British have already donated 2 million pounds to help the Chinese people.

### Amid Rising Fuel Prices, the United States Invents Liquid Fuel

Costs 40% Less Than Electricity

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] News from the Chinese Natural Science Society: Mr. Akers of the United States recently invented a new liquid compound (TetraCresyIsilicate), which can be used to replace coal, gas, and electricity for daily household needs. When this liquid compound is placed in various boilers, it can emit a high heat of 550 degrees Celsius and be conducted to various parts of the room through steam pipes for daily cooking and washing. According to Akers' test results, this substance is more economical than electricity, and the cost is only 40% of that of electricity.

### 80,000 Soviet Deserters Plan to Move to the Middle East, Unwilling to Be Sent Back to Their Country to Be Killed

[Central News Agency, Istanbul, 14th Special Dispatch] Arrangements are now underway to allow 80,000 former Soviet Red Army soldiers to reside in Arab countries, or possibly allow them to reside in Turkey, in order to avoid the large-scale massacre of these Soviet soldiers. These 80,000 Red Army soldiers are currently residing in the American-occupied areas of Germany and Italy. During World War II, they volunteered to surrender to Germany due to their anti-Russian ideology, in order to engage in their historical struggle against Russian rule. Since the Bolsheviks gained victory, although the Caucasus has nominally established socialist republics, this anti-Russian struggle has never stopped. There were originally 400,000 of them in the Red Army. Since the end of the war, some of them have been repatriated to the Soviet Union, but they have all been massacred by the authorities on charges of treason. When the British and American planned to send the second batch of anti-Soviet soldiers back to the Soviet Union, they committed suicide in prison one after another, because they would rather commit suicide than return to the Soviet Union to be killed. The British and American military authorities believe that it is inhumane to send the remaining 80,000 Soviet troops back to the Soviet Union, so they agreed to find a way for them to settle in the Middle East. It is reported that the secret "Caucasus Independence Movement Committee," headquartered in a certain place in the Middle East, is working through the Arab League to extradite them to the Middle East. It is reported that King Farouk of Egypt and the Patriarch of Jerusalem are quite in favor of the British and American proposal, while Turkey has not yet decided its opinion, because if Turkey accepts the British and American proposal, it will make the already extremely dim Turkish-Soviet relations even worse. According to news obtained from the Soviet Union, the Soviet authorities are relocating Caucasians to other regions of the Soviet Union in order to prevent them from engaging in more ethnic anti-Soviet movements. At the same time, they are relocating people from Belarus to the Caucasus to replenish the population there.

### British Foreign Policy (Part 1)

— Authored by Professor Carr, Specially Translated by this Newspaper's Translation Office

In the past, Britain would only make decisions based on instinct after an emergency occurred, but now that times have changed, meticulous planning in advance is necessary.

Forty-five years ago, whenever the German ambassador complained to the British Foreign Office that he could not understand British foreign policy, the then Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, as can be seen from his own records, always replied: "You should know that we have never formulated any foreign policy at all, but are doing something like making ends meet by moving things from the left hand to the right hand." The British never studied and planned in advance, but always relied on instinct to "improvise poetry" after an emergency occurred. This has long become a common boast of the British.

Lucky and wealthy people, in any case, do not have to rely on planning to live in the short term, can spend their resources carelessly, and apply their strength at will. The British Empire was extraordinarily lucky and wealthy in the nineteenth century, but today's Britain is absolutely not like that. In the current more difficult situation, we must use our resources sparingly and avoid wasting power in unnecessary situations. In short, we must plan our foreign policy with extreme prudence. In popular language, the word "planning" is usually applied more to economic events. However, the need for planning in politics, that is, the need for calculation in advance, is actually even greater than in economics.

Basic Points of British Foreign Policy

There are several fixed and unchanging foundations in British foreign policy, which will remain unchanged for a long time to come. One of them is Britain's geographical environment. We are too close to the European continent, which forces us to become part of it and to be Europeans, whether we like it or not. Another foundation is that Britain's natural resources are too scarce and its population is extremely excessive. She cannot survive without relying on foreign food, and her industry also partly relies on imported raw materials. This state is not absolutely unchangeable, but it has existed for more than a hundred years and will not change in any way for more than a hundred years to come. Therefore, this has become one of the many points that should be noted when considering British foreign policy. Since the food and raw materials we need cannot be obtained in Europe, British foreign policy must focus on other continents and pay attention to every continent in both the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. If I may say so, we must be ambidextrous, we must balance our policy between Europe and the overseas world, so that we can straddle the wall without falling to either side.

The above are the more fixed points in British foreign policy. At the same time, we must remember that many of the factors that have dominated British foreign policy in the past have changed, and have changed extremely drastically. If there is one cliché that is more correct than many others, then that cliché should be that we are living in a "changing world." In the changing world of the past fifty years, the change in the position of the British Empire has been even greater than the change in many other events. Less than fifty years ago, the great Foreign Secretary, the Marquess of Salisbury, sang loudly that splendid isolation was the foundation of British foreign policy. But today, no one in the country wants a policy of isolation anymore. This fact does not explain whether isolation itself is good or bad, splendid or bleak. It only shows that Britain's position in the world has changed, and therefore her foreign policy must also change accordingly.

British Advantages are Shaken

More than forty years ago, far-sighted Britons had already begun to discover that the rosy British national fortune was changing. The competition from Germany and the United States seriously encroached on Britain's commercial advantages. In the production of steel (which is always an indicator of industry and commerce), Britain began to lag behind Germany and the United States; in the Far East and the Mediterranean, the edge of British maritime power appeared embarrassingly weak. The Boer War was a worrying symbol, and Germany's rise in Europe threatened the long-established balance of power on the continent. Britain was no longer strong enough to maintain splendid isolation. At the beginning of this century, she changed her traditional policy, finally concluding an alliance with Japan and establishing an "Entente Cordiale" with France. With the support of these allies, plus the strength of the United States, Britain then won the First World War. The victory brought a short-term illusion of power and security. Germany and Russia were as dim as eclipsed moons, the United States retreated into its shell, and Britain's advantages reappeared.

But these temporary phenomena were deceptive. In fact, the First World War accelerated the decline of Britain's relative power as a world power. We only need to look at one or two more obvious examples: First, Britain had enjoyed special benefits in controlling sea power due to her position isolated from the continent and her global commerce, but now air power is at least as important as naval power. And in aviation, Britain has no advantageous natural conditions, and even has shortcomings in natural conditions. A mere island is really not enough to encourage the development of large-scale inland air transport. Second, among the various major fuels used in combat, oil has replaced coal. The benefits that Britain, as a major coal-producing country, had enjoyed have been taken over by major oil-producing countries. Third, the First World War stimulated the industrial development of many countries, thereby further undermining Britain's economic advantages. Since 1918, the United States has replaced Britain's historically first trading nation in the world.

Weaker Despite Victory

Britain, like in the First World War, has won the Second World War, but in essence has become weaker, especially in contrast to the world powers, which is very obvious. In the first decade of the nineteenth century, even in the later 1920s, we could still believe that if Britain needed allies, she would always be in a position to choose friends, and could more or less proactively stipulate some conditions in the alliance, with other countries needing Britain more than Britain needed other countries. It is doubtful whether this is still the case today. At present, Britain is looking for allies in a world dominated by countries that are far more powerful than itself in terms of population and resources. This is the dramatic change that has taken place in recent years in the 1950s, and the foreign policy that Britain will set is to be implemented in this era. Perhaps someone would like to point out to me at this point that foreign policy is not just about power, and that moral factors should also be taken into consideration when making decisions, and that British foreign policy must be based on certain moral conditions, and so on. Apart from some other reasons, and feeling that morality is also one of the elements that constitutes power, I very much agree with these views. Power requires the people to be willing to unite and act in a certain way at a certain time for a certain event. If this event cannot inspire people to have faith that is worth fighting for, then the above situation will never form. I will elaborate on this point in later speeches.

Of course, the material basis of power is also the main component of foreign policy. Without fuel, no machine can move. Power is the fuel that enables political institutions to function. I dare not say whether we made the mistake between the two world wars of trying to drive ships without coal. We made many high-sounding protests about what Japan did in China, without thinking about what we could and would do about it. The United States made the same mistake as us on this point. I hope that you will not regard me as a great Confucian or a pessimist. I want to say very formally that one of the most important tasks of foreign policy decision-making is to "cut the feet to fit the shoes." Do not overestimate what we can do or should do, arrange world affairs according to what we like, and should not engage in work that we reasonably hope to be successful.

### City Tax Revenue Improves; Winter Construction Donation Reduced; Reduced by One-Third Based on the Original Autumn Amount; Important Resolution of the City Council Last Night

[This Newspaper's Report] The Finance Committee and Budget Committee of the City Council held their first joint meeting at 6:00 PM yesterday on the 12th floor of the Wing On New Building. The meeting was attended by Speaker Pan, Deputy Speaker Xu, Secretary-General Xiang, and councilors Li Wenjie, Xu Yongzuo, Shi Yongzong, He Yuanming, Qu Xi, and 26 others. Director of the Finance Bureau Gu Chunfan, Deputy Director Hu Wenyuan, and Accounting Director Min Xiangfan were also present. Speaker Pan served as chairman. During the meeting, Director Gu reported three points: (1) The city government may be able to automatically reduce or waive the winter municipal construction donation, which was originally scheduled to be doubled compared to the autumn amount. (2) The tax revenue situation has improved. As of the end of November, entertainment, inn, banquet, business, and slaughter taxes have increased by more than 6 billion compared to the budget. (3) Under the budget figure of 18 billion yuan for autumn and winter municipal construction donations, if the winter tax revenue is collected according to the autumn tax amount, it may exceed this figure. Therefore, based on this calculation, the winter tax revenue can be reduced by 2.5 billion yuan. The attending councilors stated that the City Council has recently received letters from citizens complaining that the tax amount is too high and unaffordable. Now that the tax revenue of the Finance Bureau has improved and it is estimated that the winter municipal construction donation can still be reduced, it was decided after intense discussion that "the winter municipal construction donation should not be collected at double the autumn tax amount, and should be collected at one-third less than the original autumn tax amount," in order to meet the people's expectations. The directors immediately expressed their willingness to submit this case to Mayor Wu for approval, but stated that they reserved the point that the budget for next year is difficult to be optimistic, and if the tax revenue situation next year is not good, then the doubled amount that has been approved for this winter should still be collected to make up for it.

Also, during the meeting, Councilor Xu Yongzuo reported that the final accounts for the 34th year of the Republic of China had begun to be audited, paying attention to three points: (1) Whether the final accounts are consistent with the budget, (2) Checking whether the revenue and expenditure figures are legal, (3) Whether the figures are in line with economic principles.

### City Government Recompiles Budget for Second Half of the Year, Reducing it by 9.2 Billion

[This Newspaper's Report] The City Government's budget for the second half of the 35th year of the Republic of China was previously reviewed by the City Council. As a result, there were some items that needed to be increased or decreased, so it was handed over to the City Government for recompilation. It has now been recompiled by the City Government. Compared with the original compilation after the recompilation, the bureaus and offices that have increased funding include: the City Council by 100 million yuan, and the Social Affairs Bureau by 840 million yuan. The funding for other bureaus and offices, such as education, public works, public utilities, health, police, finance, land administration, and civil affairs civil servant subsidies, have been reduced. In total, the original compiled total amount was more than 84.7 billion yuan, and the recompiled amount is more than 75.4 billion yuan, a reduction of more than 9.2 billion yuan. At the same time, the number of personnel increased by 421.

[Another Report] According to the report on the actual revenue and expenditure figures of the City Finance Bureau, from July to November, the total revenue was more than 36.1 billion yuan, and the total expenditure was more than 47.3 billion yuan, a difference of more than 11.1 billion yuan.

### Whether to Demolish the Protruding Houses on Henan Road is Undetermined

The Public Works Committee of this City Council held its fifth meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday. Nine councilors attended, with Lu Yinchu as the chairman. Secretary Chen Huaiqing from the Public Works Bureau attended as a representative. Three proposals were discussed: (1) Approval of the Public Works Bureau's letter to send the draft of the Shanghai Municipal Agency Equipment Management Regulations for discussion. Resolution: The original draft was amended and approved, and sent to the Legal Affairs Committee for review. (2) According to the joint request of 15 merchants on Henan Middle Road to postpone the demolition of the bottleneck-shaped houses. Resolution: According to the report of the Public Works Bureau, this work has not yet been determined, and the reports are not factual. This matter will be replied to separately by Councilor Zeng in a letter. (3) Approval of the City Government's letter requesting the transfer of funds from Kangqu Road to build the widening project of Huashan Road for resolution: Approved as proposed.

### Relief for Unemployed Workers: 30,000 Bags of Flour Distributed Before the New Year

[This Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, relevant agencies held a meeting to provide relief to unemployed workers, and decided to use the remaining 30,000 bags of flour from the Unemployed Workers Assistance Association for special relief. All workers who have been unemployed for more than half a year and have three or more direct family members can register with the Unemployed Workers Assistance Committee for application after obtaining certification from the district office. This relief work is scheduled to be completed before the Lunar New Year, and each person can get two bags of flour. In addition, the committee deeply felt the shortage of relief funds and that the small amount of money was difficult to cope with. Therefore, it was decided to hold a symposium in the near future, inviting people from all walks of life to visit, in order to obtain social sympathy and assistance, and raise huge sums of money to carry out active relief work. As for the main points of yesterday's meeting, Deputy Director Li informed us as follows:

Few People and Little Money in the Reception Center

(1) The reception center for unemployed workers from the rear is located in a part of the Public University Yarn Factory. It was originally planned to accommodate 1,050 people, but in fact, it has now accommodated more than 1,800 people, resulting in poor environmental hygiene. Twenty people died of illness in mid-November. The nutrition of the workers is also insufficient, because in the past, the daily vegetable money was only 100 yuan. It was previously requested to increase it to 200 yuan, but it was not approved. The monthly funding for the reception center is only 3.5 million, but the actual expenditure is more than 10 million; and the funding for November and December has not yet been issued. In addition, there are 111 returned overseas workers, who are currently accommodated in the Sacred Heart Hospital. The Sacred Heart Hospital still has spare rooms for accommodating unemployed workers, but they still need to be repaired. The Wood Association decided to submit the current situation, improvement measures, and budget of the workers' reception center to Mayor Wu within two days, hoping to be approved as soon as possible. As for the improvement of medical and health care in the reception center, the former Health Bureau has sent personnel to inspect it. The Wood Association is now resolved to ask the Health Bureau and the Chinese Labor Association to assist in the handling.

More Than 60,000 Unemployed Workers

(2) Regarding the relief of general unemployed workers, a total of 80,000 unemployed workers applied for relief in the spring. It is estimated that no more than one-tenth of them have been re-employed. Currently, there are more than 60,000 unemployed workers in this city. Due to the sluggishness of industry and commerce, there is currently no hope for factories to accommodate unemployed workers, and the opening of cooperative factories is also impossible in the short term. As for the holding of small loans, the central government has also agreed in principle, so the reason why Mi is being handled is that one is the large number, such as lending 300,000 to each person, 60,000 people need 90 billion; the second is that the use of loans is difficult to choose, and small wood operations can only set up stalls, but it is not the time to promote this type of business, so small loans have not been handled to Song. The best relief method is to replace relief with work, but the municipal government does not have this amount of funding to hold. In summary, the relief of unemployed workers must be initiated by social forces in order to be effective. According to relevant personnel, the most miserable situation among unemployed workers is often attributed to workers from the rear who came to Shanghai. Among the 2,400 who entered, only more than 300 have been employed so far. They are technicians in the ordnance factory, and the training time requires five years. They served the country for several years, but ended up unemployed after the victory. Therefore, in future relief work, they should have priority rights.

### Income Tax for Public and Education Personnel Will Be Levied According to Base Salary

[This Newspaper's Report] Regarding the collection of income tax for public and education personnel, the Ministry of Finance has decided to levy tax according to the base salary in accordance with the revised tax law promulgated on April 16, 34th year of the Republic of China. However, the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau has not yet received this official order.

### Kerosene Prices May Tend to Stabilize; Companies Prevent Black Market by Directly Retailing; The Reason for Shortages is Due to Low Import Quotas

[This Newspaper's Report] A representative of a major kerosene company once made a public statement: accusing that the current lack of kerosene is due to the kerosene quota being too low. It is said that the current kerosene import quota is still based on the consumption before the war, and does not take into account the new needs after the war. However, kerosene was only used for lighting before the war, but today coal is scarce and the prices of other fuels are high, so almost everyone uses kerosene for cooking in the kitchen and heating in winter, resulting in the need exceeding that before the war. Only by revising the new import quota that is in line with the actual situation can the phenomenon of kerosene shortage be alleviated. And because supply and demand cannot be balanced, the black market price of kerosene has risen to 800 yuan per catty. In order to prevent black market transactions, the oil companies discussed and decided to directly retail a small amount of oil to consumers. A major company established a retail organization yesterday to supply citizens at parity prices. According to Zizi, the kerosene stock in this city is sufficient, but due to the lack of coal, the need for kerosene consumption has suddenly increased, resulting in temporary black market sales. Now, the companies have adopted the method of direct retail, and intermediate merchants have no way to take advantage of it. It is expected that the kerosene price will be able to stabilize in the short term.

### Book Industry Held a General Meeting Yesterday; Firmly Requesting Exemption from Business Tax; Elected 20 Representatives to Petition in Beijing Again; And Discussed the Issue of Profit Tax

[This Newspaper's Report] Last month, the 286 bookstores in Shanghai elected 17 representatives to petition in Beijing, requesting the Ministry of Finance to exempt the book industry from business tax. At that time, Minister Yu Hongjun expressed sympathy and was waiting for orders. Unexpectedly, recently the book industry association received a letter from the Ministry of Education transferring a letter from the Ministry of Finance, only allowing nationally designated and reviewed textbooks to be exempted from business tax, and other books must still be taxed uniformly. The entire book industry in the city was greatly confused upon hearing this news, and the group was in distress. For the sake of caution, the association specially convened a temporary general meeting of all members at the Huzhe Society on Guizhou Road at 2:00 PM yesterday. More than 200 representatives from bookstores across the city were present, with Li Bojia, Ye Suzhong, Zhang Yiqu, Xu Boxin, Guo Nongshan, and Zhou Xihe as the presidium, and representatives from the Social Affairs Bureau Dui Guangjia, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Yan Gesheng, and the Police Bureau Wu Youkang attended to provide guidance. First, the chairman of the conference, Li Bojia, reported the reason for the meeting, and then the Social Affairs Bureau Feng Guangjia gave a speech expressing sympathy. Then, representatives from various industries, such as Xu Qitang, Wang Mengzou, Yao Pengzi, Chu Wei, Song Liangrui, Wang Zhicheng, and Jiang Zhenzhan, expressed their opinions one after another. Qian believed that the book industry's request for exemption from business tax was in line with the government's main purpose of helping to develop cultural undertakings. Textbooks and other books are both cultural tools. Textbooks should be exempted from tax, and other books should also be exempted from tax. There must be no discrimination. It was unanimously advocated that representatives be sent to Beijing again to petition, and at the same time, telegrams should be sent to the national industry to respond in unison and strive for it together. If the goal is not achieved, the entire book industry in Shanghai will only have one way to automatically close down, and the emotions are extremely intense. After discussion and resolution, in addition to sending telegrams to the country's industry, Xu Qitang, Chu Wei, Wang Mengzou, and other 20 people were elected to go to Beijing on a set date to petition the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Education, and the Direct Tax Bureau separately. Then, the representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Yan Gesheng, expressed his opinions, blaming the book industry's request for exemption from business tax as a legitimate way for the country to build culture. The Shanghai Municipal Council has already resolved to exempt the tax on file. At the very least, the municipal government should respect the resolution of the council, and first exempt the book industry in Shanghai from 70% of the business tax. The central government's '30% should be asked to the central government for a ruling again. It is thought that the central government will not adhere to the previous discussion and make the daytime industry tend to be passive in supporting culture, etc. Finally, member Jiang Zhenzhan made a temporary motion that the profit tax in the 34th year of the Republic of China was extremely unfair. Our book industry should pay a total of more than 60 million yuan, and the three companies Yongxiang, Children's, and Longmen have to pay more than 30 million yuan, exceeding half of the number. The problem is serious and the conference should be asked to resolve it. At that time, the representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Yan Gesheng, dissected it and expressed sympathy for the adjustment. It was decided that a special committee of the association would discuss and adjust it to achieve a fair and reasonable solution. The meeting adjourned at 5 o'clock.

### The Enemy Property Administration Bureau Will End at the End of the Year; The Reorganization Method is Being Carefully Considered

[This Newspaper's Report] The Enemy Puppet Industry Administration Bureau has previously received an order from the Executive Yuan to end at the end of this year. Last weekend, the directors of the offices of the Su, Zhejiang, and Anhui District Administration Bureau were invited by Mr. Liu Gongyun to hold a meeting in Shanghai to discuss the ending and reorganization methods. At that time, no specific decision was obtained. The written opinions from all parties will be summarized again, and detailed methods will be formulated and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. It is learned that after the Administration Bureau ends, a "Enemy Puppet Industry Clearing Office" will be established in the Central Trust Bureau. Two-thirds to three-quarters of the original personnel in the Administration Bureau will be dismissed. The issue of the re-employment of the dismissed personnel will be introduced to other agencies as appropriate. The dismissal fee will be three months in accordance with central regulations. The Reverse Property Handling Committee will continue to exist. As for the transfer of reverse property to local financial authorities for management, there are difficulties. The Administration Bureau plans to ask the Executive Yuan for instructions again.

According to the person in charge of the Central Trust Bureau, no official order has been received regarding the merger of the Administration Bureau into the bureau. As for what kind of organization should be established to be responsible for handling the unfinished pending cases of the Administration Bureau, and how the handover method should be, the bureau is carefully considering it.

According to general observation, it is considered that there are difficulties in incorporating the Administration Bureau into the Trust Bureau. Because the Trust Bureau is national, while the Administration Bureau is a district system, and the district regulations are quite inconsistent, and it is inevitable that there will be inconveniences in the merger.

### Disposal Measures for Officers and Soldiers Sent Back from Burma Determined

[This Newspaper's Report] The disposal measures for the so-called "bad officers and soldiers" who were detained by the British side in Burma and sent back have been specifically decided after discussions between the representatives of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Garrison Command, and the Conscription Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense in recent days, and will be implemented within days. It is learned that except for a small number of those who originally had military status but have not completed their service period, they will be allocated to the troops, and the rest will be released uniformly. Those who are poor and helpless will be relieved by relevant agencies and sent back to their hometowns. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other three agencies will jointly issue a statement on this matter.

### Large Quantities of Soybean Flour and Fishing Gear Shipped by UNRRA in Two Rounds

[This Newspaper's Report] Two more rounds of UNRRA-shipped materials to China have recently arrived in Shanghai. The "Lomi Bauerwin" that arrived on the 15th carried 49,780 tons of black beans and 769 packages of cotton fabrics. The "Feilun" arrived in Shanghai yesterday, carrying white flour, soybean flour, soybean chips, centrifugal pumps, fishing nets, steel plates, large fishing nets, etc., but the total amount is unknown. The authorities have instructed to distribute them immediately to avoid delays.

In addition, the UNRRA Washington headquarters recently responded to the request of the China Office and will send St. Louis to conduct a survey of the remaining materials obtained by the Bi Investigator. St. Louis will arrive in Shanghai soon and will talk to the heads of various departments and investigate related businesses.

### Dispute at China Paper Mill; Conciliation Record Established Yesterday

Laid-Off Workers Have Priority Reinstatement Rights

[This Newspaper's Report] The China Paper Mill had a labor-management dispute due to the laid-off workers requesting reinstatement. After mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau, a conciliation record was established yesterday. The main points are as follows: (1) The employer is allowed to lay off a part of the workers due to sluggish business; (2) The aforementioned laid-off workers will be issued lay-off compensation in accordance with the law; (3) The year-end bonus and wages for the layoff period of the laid-off workers will be issued by the employer for 20 days; (4) When the employer's business improves in the future, this group of laid-off workers has priority reinstatement rights, but the employer has the right to choose.

### Relief for Refugees: Fundraising Charity Ball

The city's Winter Relief Association Fundraising Committee held a meeting yesterday afternoon on the third floor of the Pudong Native Place Association to raise funds for relief through a charity ball. First, Mr. Wang Xianqing reported on the current progress of the association's radio fundraising efforts, totaling over 700,000 donations. To date, approximately 60,000,000 yuan has been received, with 40,000,000 yuan also donated by residents of various districts. Subsequently, discussions were held on how to proceed with the charity ball, and the following was decided: (1) The ball will be held from January 6th to 10th next year at the Yiyuan Grand Hotel on Albert Road; (2) Donation tickets will be printed, and purchasers can enjoy a sumptuous Western meal and various preferential treatments; (3) Ten famous figures from Shanghai, ten movie stars, ten singers, ten dancers, ten male opera performers, ten female opera performers, and ten famous courtesans will be invited to serve as hosts; (4) Entertainment will include a hula dance by Miss Wang Yuan, spectacular dances by German women, lotteries, and singing and comedy performances.

### Municipal Fishery Association Cables Grain Department Requesting Grain Transport Permits

Since its reorganization and establishment, the Municipal Fishery Association has spared no effort in its work, particularly concerning the livelihoods of fishermen. As most of the city's seafood comes from the islands of Shengsi and Zhoushan, where arable land is scarce, the fishermen's grain supply has traditionally been provided by seafood merchants who exchange rice for fish, a convenient arrangement for both parties. However, the rice used by these merchants is mainly purchased in this city, and the recent ban on rice exports by the municipal authorities has made it impossible to transport the grain, severely affecting the fishery industry and the livelihood of the people. The association cabled the Grain Department yesterday, requesting permission to issue transport permits or to allow the association to issue certificates for export, in order to facilitate the fishing industry and maintain the people's livelihood.

### Police Dogs Demonstrate Skills: Carrying Opium Has Nowhere to Escape

[This Newspaper's Report] A reporter recently accompanied Mr. Fang Zhichao, Director of the Administrative Department of the Police Bureau, to inspect the opium detoxification work at the Huade Road Police Hospital and to observe police dogs detecting smuggled opium.

Approximately forty opium addicts, both men and women, were undergoing detoxification at the hospital. Most were registered addicts who had voluntarily entered the hospital, and as a result, most had already quit and had a healthy complexion.

To detect opium smuggling, the hospital keeps two specially trained police dogs, both left behind by the former Japanese. One, named "Wu Pei," demonstrated its search capabilities on the spot. An opium pipe was hidden in the inner pocket of a reporter present, and "Wu Pei" was instructed to find it. The police dog sniffed around the people present and, upon discovery, barked wildly at the reporter and retrieved the opium pipe from the pocket. In this way, smugglers of opium will have difficulty escaping the law.

### Final Stage of Opium Eradication: Extreme Penalty for All Starting New Year's Day

[This Newspaper's Report] Yesterday was the first day of the city's expanded publicity week for opium eradication. The Municipal Government hosted the city's press at the Municipal Government Conference Room at 4:30 PM. Mayor Wu Guozhen was attending a financial conference convened by President Song and was represented by Secretary-General He Dekui. First, Mr. Fang Zhichao, Director of the Administrative Department of the Police Bureau, reported on the city's opium suppression work, which is being carried out in three phases. It has now been decided that a general inspection of opium addicts will be conducted starting on January 1st next year. At that time, those who have not undergone detoxification will be treated as relapse offenders and subject to the extreme penalty.

Director Fang then reported on the organization and facilities of the opium detoxification center, the detoxification procedures, and the actual work. He stated that since its establishment on May 1st of this year, the center has detoxified a total of 2,898 opium addicts, of whom 2,006 were self-registered and 892 were opium offenders arrested after being reported. The detoxification results showed that 605 were addicted and 2,293 were not addicted.

Director Fang continued: Starting today, the Civil Affairs Bureau will launch publicity efforts in various Baojia, the Education Bureau will order all primary and secondary schools to fully cooperate in the anti-opium campaign, and the Social Affairs Bureau will order all movie theaters in the city to show anti-opium lantern slides, in order to gather collective wisdom and prevent the city from being as filled with opium smoke as in the past.

Mr. Liu Xuehai, Special Commissioner for Opium Suppression in Jiangsu Province, then spoke, believing that the promotion of opium eradication in Shanghai is more difficult than in other places due to the special circumstances. This is evidenced by the recent police report on suicide figures for this year, in which more than half of the 800 deaths were due to opium poisoning, indicating that the opium suppression work is not thorough enough and that opium is too easily obtained. Liu also emphasized the government's determination to eradicate opium, stating "no tolerance, no relaxation, no compromise." Mayor Wu's recent decision to increase the reward for reporting opium offenders by 50,000,000 yuan is also aimed at thoroughly realizing opium eradication.

### Memorial Service Held Yesterday for Deceased Senator Zhong Ketuo

[This Newspaper's Report] The memorial service for the late City Senator and District Chief of the Fourteenth District, Zhong Ketuo, was held at the YMCA Auditorium at 2:00 PM yesterday. The venue was filled with wreaths and elegiac couplets. More than 300 people attended, including Mayor Wu Guozhen, Director Zhang Xiaosong, Councilor Wang Zhuyi, Song Zhefu, Wu Baojin, Cheng Bingji, Jiang Xiangduo, and Zhong's relatives and friends. Mayor Wu presided over the service and delivered a report expressing his condolences. Song Zhefu then reported on Zhong's life and his contributions to social service, opium suppression, and disaster relief. Zhang Xiaosong and Wang Zhuyi also praised Zhong's efforts to help the world and save people. It is reported that Zhong's friends are raising funds to establish a Ketuo Primary and Secondary School, and all the condolence money will be used as the school's foundation.

### Jiang Ya Steamer Resumes Voyage to Ningbo: Ding Sheng Expected to Arrive Today

[This Newspaper's Report] Due to the recent inclement weather and difficult navigation conditions, the Shanghai-Ningbo Qianda Hua Steamer has been delayed. The originally scheduled sailing from Shanghai to Ningbo on the 15th finally departed yesterday. The next sailing is scheduled for tomorrow from Shanghai to Ningbo. The China Merchants Bureau's Shanghai-Ningbo Jiang Ya Steamer, which was suspended for boiler repairs last week, has been completed and resumed its voyage to Ningbo yesterday. The Zhonglian Company's Ji Lian Han has recently been chartered to the Jewish Agency and is scheduled to sail to Keelung this Friday.

In other news, the Jardine Matheson Company's new steamer, Ding Sheng, is expected to arrive today and sail to Hong Kong this Friday. The Ben Line Company's new steamer, Xinjiang, is scheduled to sail to Hong Kong at 3:00 PM this afternoon. This is also a new steamer since the war. The American President Lines' first returning mail ship, General Meiqi, was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow, but it is now known that it will be delayed by one day and is expected to arrive on the 19th.

### Thugs Claiming to Borrow Money Shoot Flour Shop Owner

[This Newspaper's Report] At around 9:00 PM last night, two thugs wearing blue cloth shirts and trousers and raincoats suddenly appeared at the Fuxinglong Flour Shop at No. 50 Huaiji Street, Xizang South Road. They claimed to want to buy two bags of flour, and the shop owner, Wu Yueyang, 26 years old, from Tianjin, went to serve them. Unexpectedly, one of them changed his tone and said that he had come to borrow 5,000,000 yuan in legal tender due to financial difficulties. Wu sensed danger and was about to turn back when he was shot in the chest and fell to the ground. The thugs then fled. Neighbors discovered the incident and quickly called an ambulance to take Wu to Nanyang Hospital for treatment. His life is in danger due to the severity of the injury. The case is currently being investigated by the police, and it is possible that it was a revenge killing.

### First Ambassador to the Vatican Wu Jingxiong Departed for Europe Today to Take Up His Post: Elegant Written Remarks Published at Shanghai Residence: Expounding on Religious Beliefs and Encouraging the World

[This Newspaper's Special Report] The General Xiafei transported Archbishop Li Boli, the first apostolic delegate to China. Today at noon, our country's ambassador to the Vatican, Dr. Wu Jingxiong, will take the "General Xiafei" to Europe to assume his post. In about a month, he can arrive at the solemn and holy Vatican Palace.

Harboring Ancient Sorrows, Containing Eternal Joys

Yesterday, Wu published a very elegant written statement at his Shanghai residence. He said: "In my heart, I often harbor ancient sorrows and contain eternal joys. Therefore, in the most difficult times, there is still great comfort; and in the most joyful times, there is still great sorrow. I feel that my heart is in complete harmony with God; I feel even more uneasy for my compatriots who have not yet reached this state. If there is a day when I do not reach the state of harmony between man and God, there will be a sense of regret. According to my experience, I always feel that the joy of life is directly proportional to the degree of union with God. Those who are not in union with God are the source of all suffering; those who are in union with God are the source of all true joy. Therefore, while I am seeking happiness for myself, I am deeply moved to see others still in pain. Those who believe in God take the sacred heart of Jesus as their own; the sacred heart of Jesus is the compassion for all people. If there is one person or one thing in the world that is not in its proper place, I feel that I am not in my proper place. Those who believe in religion have a deeper degree of happiness than ordinary people; and the scope of pain is also wider than usual. Believing in religion means bearing the cross. Moreover, the two meanings of "freedom" and "obedience" seem to be contradictory; but in religious life, they are integrated into one. The more one obeys God's will, the more freedom one feels. All unfreedom comes from human desires. If one can eliminate human desires and preserve heavenly principles, one will have the freedom of "fish leaping from the customs gate and birds flying freely in the sky." The source of the world's chaos lies in misunderstanding the true meaning of freedom. People usually think that satisfying human desires is freedom; in fact, the stronger human desires are, the more they are slaves to the three enemies: the flesh, the world, and the devil. The so-called "standing upright between heaven and earth" must first mean connecting with heaven before standing on earth. If not, where will one find a foothold? The process of developing spiritual life can be divided into three movements: first, non-detachment (Attachment), which means "following the crowd"; second, detachment (Detachment), which means "being independent"; third, from detachment, one must still embrace compassion, which means "sacrificing oneself for others." It is most difficult to enter the third stage from the second stage. This is what I want to share with the world."

Visiting in the Rain, Guests Gathered

Yesterday, the reporter visited Ambassador Wu in the rain. It so happened that Ambassador Wu was hosting a private lunch for Archbishop Li Boli and many Catholic celebrities. Many believers knelt down and bowed to the Archbishop. Ambassador Wu, wearing a blue robe and holding a seven- or eight-inch ivory cigarette holder in his hand, circulated among the guests in high spirits.

In Ambassador Wu's study, I saw Mr. Yao Xinong. On the desk was a piece of white paper with the words "One World Under Heaven" written in large ink strokes by Mr. Quan Zengshe, followed by the names of many guests as a farewell memento. The walls were lined with bookshelves filled with books, mostly on law, religion, and literature, and quite a few old thread-bound books. Occasionally, a few new Western magazines were scattered on top of the neatly arranged sets of books. If it is said that one can see a person's character from their collection of books, then one can see how erudite Wu is from these books.

Wu's Party Consisted of Sixteen People

This time, Wu's party consisted of sixteen people. In addition to Wu and his wife, Ms. Li Delan, there were twelve of Wu's sons and daughters and one of Wu's daughters-in-law. Wu is forty-eight years old this year and married at the age of eighteen. To date, he has thirteen sons and daughters, nine sons and four daughters. The eldest is twenty-nine years old, and the youngest is six years old. This time, only the eldest son, Zulin, stayed in Shanghai.

I asked Wu what he thought of the progress of the constitutional draft discussion. Wu thought for a while and said, "I have been busy preparing to go abroad these days, so I am not very clear about the progress of the discussion, but I guess it will not undergo major revisions and can be passed."

Talking about the work of retranslating the Bible, Wu told me that in addition to the "Psalms" in the Old Testament, which has been translated and published as "Translation of the Psalms", the first draft of the New Testament has also been completed, and it is translated in classical Chinese. He said modestly that he wanted to go abroad to see some of the works on translating the Bible in various countries. In addition, he plans to translate some other Biblical literature.

Tianxia Monthly is Difficult to Republish

I asked about the "Tianxia" monthly magazine, which everyone is very concerned about. Mr. Yao Xinong said that it is really not easy to republish in the current environment. I suggested that Ambassador Wu collect and publish many of his insightful essays that he had previously published in "Tianxia". Wu said: "Really, there are quite a few articles to collect, and it is indeed possible to publish a collection."

From the fact that "Tianxia" cannot be republished, we can see the low level of cultural standards in Shanghai. When this collection comes out, perhaps it can slightly satisfy the thirst of countless readers? Italy is a beautiful country that evokes a sense of nostalgia. We deeply hope that Ambassador Wu will give us more beautiful and refined essays in his spare time!

### President Song Convenes Meeting to Discuss Financial and Economic Issues: Also Consulted on Opening US Cotton Exchange in the Afternoon

### Shanghai International Radio Actively Expanding Business: Plans to Add World Broadcasting and International Telephone: Preparing to Open Sino-US and Sino-British Wireless Facsimile

[This Newspaper's Report] The International Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications now sends 1,600 to 1,700 telegrams abroad every day, of which 40% are sent to the United States, 20% to Hong Kong, and 10% to London; the rest are sent to other parts of the world. Because it is difficult to add equipment, the expansion of trunk roads is also relatively slow. Recently, it is planning to open a South American route and prepare to communicate with the capitals of Argentina and Peru. At the same time, it has ordered powerful transmitters, receivers, and teleprinters from abroad to increase reception and transmission efficiency.

As of recently, Shanghai International Radio has resumed the following circuits: Geneva, Los Angeles, Manila, London, Macau, Hong Kong, Columbus, Paris, Saigon, Bangkok, Moscow, Irkutsk, Sydney, and Mumbai. It is expected to expand 38 telegraph circuits, including 15 Asian circuits, 9 North and South American circuits, 10 European circuits, and 2 African and Australian circuits each.

Like major radio stations in the world, the International Radio Station also adopts a remote control system, with the central control room, transmitting station, and receiving station set up in three places. The central control room of the International Radio Station is located on the second floor of the Sassoon Building and is equipped with six German-made transmitters and eight receivers; three American-made transmitters and four receivers; and one French-made transmitter and receiver each. The transmitting station is located in Zhenru, covering an area of approximately 250 mu, and the receiving station is located in Zhabei, also covering an area of approximately 250 mu. The equipment is made in the United States, Britain, France, and Germany.

In addition to telegrams, the International Radio Station is also planning to add world broadcasting and international telephone services, and is first preparing to test calls with the United States and Britain. In order to meet international needs, it is also actively preparing to open wireless facsimile between China and the United States and China and the United Kingdom. But what the result will be depends on equipment and talent. Equipment is originally scarce, and talent is often poached by other organizations because the salaries are too low (the International Radio Station is based on civil servant salaries). Only when these two problems are solved can all plans be realized!

### Reviewing the Past and Discussing Business Policies: National Cooperative Supply and Marketing Conference Opens

The National Cooperative Goods Supply and Marketing Office of the Ministry of Social Affairs was established in Chongqing in 1940, aiming to strengthen the business of production and consumer cooperatives at all levels, and achieved considerable results. After the victory, it returned to the east with the National Government and re-established the national cooperative supply and marketing network. It has successively established six branch offices in Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, Chongqing, Guangzhou, and Shenyang, and three offices in Anqing, Taiwan, and Beiping. Since Mr. Chen Zhongming took over the office in October of this year, he decided to move the headquarters from Nanjing to Shanghai, because he felt that it would be better to develop the business in Shanghai. He also added an office in Nanjing to facilitate communication. Now, in order to review the past work situation, adapt to the current situation of domestic and foreign trade, and establish the cooperative supply and marketing business policy, following the office's own business meeting on the previous two days. Today, it convened a National Cooperative Supply and Marketing Business Conference in the meeting room of the YMCA on Sichuan Middle Road. Representatives from 25 provincial and municipal cooperative supply and marketing offices and unions in Hankou, Tianjin, Gansu, Shanxi, Zhejiang, Yunnan, Shaanxi, Suiyuan, Hubei, Shandong, Hebei, Sichuan, Henan, Qingdao, and Taiwan participated. The estimated agenda is as follows: the opening ceremony will be held this morning, followed by business reports this afternoon; the proposals will be reviewed on the morning of the 18th, followed by discussions in the afternoon; and discussions will continue all day on the 19th before the closing ceremony.

### Arrested for Finding Lost Child: Turns Out to Be Abduction Plot for Fraud

[This Newspaper's Report] Yao Lengshi, a woman at No. 34 Huaxing Road, Zhabei, has an affair with Ma Lishan, who is a rogue and often extorts money from her, which is unbearable. Around Double Ten Day this year, Ma borrowed 1,000,000 yuan from his friend Xue Funeng, stating that it would be repaid within one month. Unexpectedly, when it was due on November 10, Ma was unable to repay it. He discussed it with Yao, and Yao signed a check to extend the deadline for another month. Who knew that when it was due on the 10th of this month, Yao was also unable to repay it, so it was delayed. A few days later, Yao's five-year-old child, Youqing, suddenly went missing, and all searches were unsuccessful. The day before yesterday afternoon, Yao went to her son's maternal grandmother's house on Luxiangyuan Road in the city and met Xue Fulong on the way. She talked about her son Youqing's disappearance and asked him to pay attention to finding him. Xue readily agreed on the spot and asked Yao to issue a letter of authorization, stating that if he could find the child, she would reward him with 1,000,000 yuan, and he would also bear the 1,000,000 yuan that Ma Lishan owed before, totaling 2,000,000 yuan. At that time, Yao was eager to find her son and agreed. They then separated. On the 14th, Yao suddenly received a letter, roughly stating that if she wanted her son, she should meet him at the entrance of the North Railway Station Boundary Road Post Office at 10:00 AM tomorrow. When she went there, she saw Xue there and went up to talk to him. He replied that she must pay first before she could get her son back. When Yao heard this, she knew that there must be a reason, so she called the police and arrested him at the North Station Sub-bureau. According to his confession, he did not abduct the child, but Ma Lishan did, and he revealed the location where he was hiding. Director He of the sub-bureau ordered Section Chief Ding to lead the police to a house on Binlang Road, the home of Ma's sister, Xing Ma, and rescued the child. Ma Lishan, Xing Ma, and others were taken to the sub-bureau to await transfer.

### Newspaper and Magazine Inventory and Recertification: Ministry of Interior Sets Four Measures

[This Newspaper's Report] The Ministry of Interior stated that newly opened newspapers and magazines that have been approved for registration in various places have been greatly changed due to migration and twists and turns due to the anti-Japanese war. In addition, the registration certificates issued by the Ministry of Interior during the war were limited to material resources, and the paper quality may be inferior, making it difficult to last for a long time. Now that culture is being restored, it is necessary to conduct an inventory and reissue new certificates to protect their distribution and understand the actual distribution situation. The following four measures have been specified for the inventory and recertification: (1) All newspapers and magazines that were approved for registration and given certificates before July 1946 and are still being published shall be required to exchange them for new registration certificates. (2) To exchange for new registration certificates, each newspaper and magazine shall submit the original registration certificate together with a copy of the most recent publication of the newspaper or magazine to the local competent authority for transfer to the Ministry for processing. (3) Local competent authorities and provincial and municipal governments shall handle cases of exchanging registration certificates as they arrive. After sending them to the Ministry for issuing new certificates, they shall be quickly transferred to facilitate distribution. (4) Newspapers and magazines that have been approved for registration and given certificates, but have exceeded the publication date stipulated in the Publication Law and have not yet been published, shall be responsible for investigating and verifying the facts by the local competent authority, and submit the original registration certificates for transfer to the Ministry for cancellation.

### Three Strange Men Open Fire and Refuse Inspection at Night

[This Newspaper's Report] Police officer No. 471 of the Jing'an Temple Police Station, on the morning of the 15th at 3:30 AM, drove a free bicycle from the police station to the 29th district to take over the 3:00 to 7:00 AM shift. When the car passed the west side of Dede Primary School on Huashan Road, he saw three people coming towards him. One was wearing a brown raincoat, one was wearing a black overcoat, and the identity of the other was unknown. They were carrying a leather bag, a suitcase, and a woman's overcoat, and their behavior was suspicious. He immediately drove to the patrol station in the 29th Joint Management District and, together with police officer No. 680, went to order them to stop for inspection. Unexpectedly, the person wearing the black overcoat took out a gun and fired one shot, and the three fled into the alley and escaped in the direction of the Zhu Family Warehouse. The police officers returned fire and chased after them. When they reached the turn at the Zhu Family Warehouse, police officer No. 680 fired another shot, which seemed to have hit one of them in the foot. But they immediately disappeared. Later, they searched two or three lanes and saw a few drops of blood on the ground with a flashlight, and a suitcase that had been thrown down. When opened, it was empty, with only four photos. On the back of one of the photos were the numbers "Fan Huaqing, No. 14, 10th Jia, 1st Lianbao, 3rd Fang, Huxi." At dawn, the police ordered the police to search the joint management areas of the 8th, 9th, and 13th districts, but found nothing. They also sent personnel to the major hospitals to inquire, but found nothing.

### Missing Plane Crashed in Changxing; All Crew and Passengers Killed; Central Air Transport Corporation Received Urgent Telegram from Changxing County Government; Personnel Dispatched Overnight to Investigate and Handle Aftermath

[Our Dispatch] Central Air Transport Corporation passenger plane No. 31, which went missing on the 14th of this month en route from Nanjing to Shanghai, was found yesterday within the territory of Changxing County, Zhejiang Province. Both the plane and all personnel were destroyed. It is not yet known whether the thirty-one boxes of banknotes on board were burned. The Central Air Transport Corporation received an urgent telegram from the Changxing County government at 4:30 PM and dispatched personnel overnight to the accident site to investigate the details and handle the aftermath.

Plane No. 31, flying the Nanjing-Shanghai route, flew from Beijing to Nanjing on the 13th and then from Nanjing to Shanghai at 2:00 PM on the 14th, going missing forty-five minutes after takeoff. The plane carried thirty-one boxes of banknotes being transported from Beijing to Shanghai. In addition to the pilot, co-pilot Ma, Xiang, Zhang, Dong and the radio operator Zhong Da, there were also two passengers, Xue Jin and Zai Tianfang, who requested temporary passage from Beijing. As for the four passengers who boarded in Beijing and Jinan, it is understood that they disembarked in the two capitals, and did not continue the journey from Nanjing. After discovering that the plane was missing, the Central Air Transport Corporation dispatched planes for several days to search along the Nanjing-Shanghai line, including the Suzhou-Wuxi area, without finding any clues. It was not until yesterday afternoon, around 4:00 PM, that they suddenly received an urgent telegram from the Changxing County government. The original telegram stated: "Your company's air transport XP-26 crashed in Nongshan, our county, on the 14th at 17:00 hours, all personnel dead. Please advise on how to handle. Changxing County Government, Zhejiang (Telegram dated 16th)."

It did not mention whether the thirty-one boxes of banknotes on board (weighing 1,579 kilograms) were completely destroyed. It is understood that these banknotes were being transported to the Bank of China in Shanghai.

Note: Changxing is located southwest of Taihu Lake, an area with many mountains, approximately 40 kilometers north of Yixing and 90 kilometers east of Jiaxing. During the Anti-Japanese War, it was a hotspot for guerrilla activities. The cause of the accident is likely due to the adverse weather conditions on the day, with strong northeasterly winds causing the plane to deviate from its route and crash into the mountains.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 16th] According to Director Liao Zhongshuang of the Nanjing station, the crash site of Central Air Transport Corporation plane No. 31 has been identified as a small mountain near Longhua Temple in Lijia Township, Changxing (the area is near Taihu Lake, north of Mogan Mountain), with both the plane and personnel destroyed. However, for verification purposes, further inquiries are still underway.

### China National Aviation Corporation Passenger Plane Crashed into Parked Plane; China National Aviation Corporation to Seek Compensation

[Our Dispatch] China National Aviation Corporation flight No. 67, en route from Nanjing to Shanghai on the 14th, crashed into the right wing of air plane No. 104, transferred from Dahua Airlines to the New Sui Corporation, upon landing at Longhua Airport.

According to the company's report from the airport, the China National Aviation Corporation plane can still be used after repairs. The issue of compensation or repair for the damaged China National Aviation Corporation plane belonging to the New Sui Corporation is still under negotiation.

According to sources from the New Sui Corporation, the damage to air plane No. 104 is severe and may be beyond repair. Therefore, the company will demand that the China National Aviation Corporation provide full compensation for the plane. The New Sui Corporation claims that the China National Aviation Corporation has already verbally agreed, but the specific details are still under discussion.

### Survivors of Plane Crash Near Huangdu Out of Danger

[Our Dispatch] At 4:00 PM on the 15th, a military plane crashed near Huangdu on the Nanjing-Shanghai line. The plane, a vehicle-mounted plane with serial number 417233 belonging to the Subei Pacification Command, was flown from Dongtai County, Subei, by liaison staff officer Lu Xuedun, accompanied by mechanic Zhang Fusen. While flying over Huangdu, the plane experienced mechanical failure and was forced to land near Li Jialou Village, approximately two kilometers from Huangdu. During the landing, it accidentally struck a rice paddy and a grave mound, damaging the nose of the plane. The staff officer and mechanic were injured on the spot and were transported to the Sino-American Hospital in Shanghai for treatment by passing vehicles. Fortunately, their injuries were minor and their lives are not in danger. The damaged plane remains in the rice paddy, guarded by police officers dispatched by the Huangdu Police Station. Relevant departments have telegraphed the Subei Pacification Command for instructions.

### Improving Mediation Techniques in Labor-Management Disputes

[Our Dispatch] The Social Affairs Bureau's mediation techniques for labor-management disputes have been improved after discussions at a meeting last Saturday. The key points are as follows: (1) The number of representatives from both labor and management will be limited to five: two official representatives and three observers. If the dispute has unique characteristics, such as involving an entire industry or the entire city, each side may have up to ten representatives. (2) If workers exhibit unreasonable behavior, they will be warned once. If they do not listen, mediation will be suspended. If it is still ineffective, the police will be asked to assist in maintaining order. (3) In the past, management representatives often repeatedly failed to attend mediation sessions. The Social Affairs Bureau now plans to stipulate that if they do not attend the third invitation, a decision will be made based on the labor side's opinion. This measure will be implemented after approval by Director Wu. In addition, there will be improved measures for the cleanliness and order of the mediation venue.

### Continued Trial of Traitor Huang Liewen, Former Qingpu County Magistrate

Du Gang's Wife Testifies in Court

Huang Liewen, the traitorous former Qingpu County Magistrate, committed numerous atrocities during his time in the puppet government. He also sold out Du Gang, a commissioner of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, in an effort to curry favor with the enemy, leading to Du's brutal persecution by the Japanese military police. The case was re-examined by the High Court yesterday. At 9:00 AM, High Court President Liu Yugui and judges Qiu and Liang ascended the bench. The defendant was escorted to the criminal court by bailiffs. He claimed to be a 38-year-old native of Songjiang, who grew up in Shanghai. Before the war, he served as an instructor at the Nanjing Central Military Academy. He insisted he took on the position in the puppet government due to the circumstances at the time, maintaining close ties with the National Army and providing many conveniences to underground comrades. Du Gang's widow, Lu Huimin, testified that Du's martyrdom was indeed due to the defendant's betrayal. The court then adjourned the case for further hearing at a later date.

### Complex Case of Traitorous Brothers

[Our Dispatch] Huang Quanfu and Huang Quangui, the two brothers accused by Wang Haoran, were foremen at the Mitsubishi Wharf on the Huangpu River before the war. The charges against them include establishing the puppet Jiangnan Company, purchasing the Dapeng steamship, and leasing it to the enemy's Zhonghua Company. Huang Quangui also purchased the Nanfang steamship and leased it to the enemy's International Company. Yesterday afternoon, the High Court held a hearing. The two defendants, one thin and one fat, vehemently denied the accusations. They claimed that the puppet Jiangnan Company was founded by the plaintiff, Wang Haoran, and presented a contract signed by Wang Haoran as evidence. They stated that the steamship was confiscated by the Japanese, not leased to them. They also filed a counter-suit accusing Wang Haoran of using the accusation of being a traitor to extort a large sum of money, which has been forwarded by the High Prosecutor's Office to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. After arguments by the defendants' defense lawyers, Zhang Muping, Jiang Baoyan, and Cai Lin, the court adjourned the case for further hearing due to its complexity.

### A Minor Devil Under the Demon; "Pockmarked A-Gen" Tried Yesterday

[Our Dispatch] Wang Bin, nicknamed "Pockmarked A-Gen," a native of Ningbo, was accused of joining Wu Shibao's organization as a special agent in May of the 29th year of the Republic, arresting underground workers. In July of the 31st year of the Republic, he was introduced by Zheng Qifeng of the Fujika Unit at No. 19 Zhaofeng Villa and transferred to the unit as an intelligence chief. He identified the plaintiff, Lu Xisheng, as a suspected member of the guerrilla forces, prompting the Japanese military police to detain him for several days before he was released. The defendant was later transferred to Pan Yuan's Special High Section of the puppet Shanghai Bureau in Huxi, where he relied on the power of the enemy and puppet government to protect gambling activities. Lu Xisheng and Zhu Rongbao filed lawsuits successively. Yesterday afternoon, the High Court held a hearing. The defendant denied all the accusations. The court adjourned the case for further hearing.

### Zhang Pei Denies Being a Puppet Official; Claims Mistaken Identity

[Our Dispatch] Zhang Pei, accused of being a henchman of the traitor Luo Junqiang, serving as a company commander and battalion commander in the puppet Shanghai Security Command, and later as the head of the Enterprise Section of the Propaganda Department and the head of the Third Section of the Finance Bureau of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Government in April of the 34th year of the Republic, denied yesterday afternoon at the High Court hearing that he had ever held any puppet positions. The defendant's defense lawyer, Shan Yuhua, argued that there was another person named Zhang Pei in the occupied area and requested the court to investigate and handle the matter. The court postponed the hearing pending investigation.

### New Location of the High Prosecutor's Office; Lu Ying's Former Residence; Tour of Chuyuan Garden

[Our Dispatch] The Shanghai High Prosecutor's Office previously announced that it would move to No. 25 Jianguo Road, Chuyuan Garden, to conduct business. The reporter learned that the new office address has been fully prepared. Yesterday morning, in the face of impending rain, the reporter took a car to inspect the new bureau.

First, let's introduce the history of "Chuyuan Garden." This residence was built by Lu Ying, a notorious bigwig and deputy director of the puppet police bureau during the enemy-puppet era. It is located on the west side of Jianguo West Road (formerly Route Tenant de la Tour) and Zhongzheng South Second Road (formerly Rue Père Froc), facing north with a three-story Western-style house and a garden behind it. After Lu was arrested, he was imprisoned in the house. Several notorious major traitors, such as Liang Hongzhi, were also detained there, making "Chuyuan Garden" a "Chu prison." After the reporter handed in his name card, Chief Prosecutor Du Baoqi received him. Mr. Du, a native of Fujian, over fifty years old, mentioned that he has been feeling unwell recently due to being too busy with work. Mr. Du wore a casual hat and a gray cloth robe. His gentle manner and simple attire fully demonstrated his scholarly nature. After a brief exchange of pleasantries, he asked Chief Secretary Xu Kaisu to lead the reporter on a tour of the premises. To the right of the entrance is the Receiving and Dispatch Office, the General Affairs Office, the Judicial Police Office, and the Waiting Room. The main hall is downstairs. Yesterday's memorial service for the anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death was held there. The outer reception room is decorated with classical elegance, featuring mahogany tables and chairs and marble tabletops. Behind it are two interrogation rooms. The Chief Secretary's office, the inner reception room, and the Chief Prosecutor's office are on the second floor. The prosecutors' offices are on the third floor. The layout is orderly. The reporter stood in front of the window in the inner reception room, looking at a square military field outside with an air raid shelter in the middle, shaped like a tomb. Surrounded by bald trees and leaden clouds, it evoked a sense of desolation and austerity. Imagining the bustling scene of Lu Ying's past glory, the reporter couldn't help but sigh, "For whose sake are they toiling so hard?"

The reporter spoke at length with Chief Secretary Xu. He told me that in addition to Chief Prosecutor Du Baoqi, there are also prosecutors Lin Wopeng, Dai Rongduo, Sun Xiangrong, Liu Yanhong, Qu Rong, Ye Yushao, Xia Luli, Chen Siyong, and Lin Houqi, a total of nine prosecutors. Even with so many prosecutors, they are still overwhelmed with work. The High Prosecutor's Office's previous office on West Esson Road and the temporary office attached to the Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison were both closed yesterday and moved to the new location. Subsequently, prisoners who are under investigation will be sent to the Masnan Road Detention Center for convenience in the investigation. The original office on West Esson Road will be converted into the High Prosecutor's Office's storage room.

### Ling Guangyan and Three Portuguese Traitors Receive Reduced Sentences After Retrial; Shen Liang Acquitted Due to Insufficient Evidence

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday morning, the High Court delivered verdicts in three suspected traitor cases: (1) Ling Guangyan graduated from Zhizhi University in his early years, studied commercial law in France, and married a Japanese woman. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, he joined the puppet organization and held various military and political positions, including the major general brigade commander of the puppet Second Army, for six years. He also opened the "Dafa Company" in Lu'an and established a "comfort station." The High Court previously sentenced him to twelve years in prison. Ling appealed, and the Supreme Court remanded the case for retrial. The case was heard in the Second Criminal Court of the High Court on the 9th of this month. Yesterday morning, the sentence was changed to eight years of imprisonment with deprivation of civil rights for eight years. (2) The Portuguese national Nakamura Remedios, whose mother is Japanese, purchased 150 tons of gasoline for the Japanese Nakamura Tani Yoshi during the occupation of Shanghai. The High Court previously sentenced Remedios to eight years in prison, his assistant Xue Faer to two years and six months, and Xi Bake to four years.

The sea of people is vast and I don't know what to do! At the beginning of this year, my sister introduced me to live with a Mr. Zhu. At that time, there was no marriage contract. At first, our feelings were still compatible, but after a few months, he changed his mind. Quarrels arose from time to time. After an argument, I ran away. I would like to ask: (1) Does the other party have the right to interfere after the separation? (2) Am I allowed to marry someone else? Is it illegal?

[Lawyer Cao Yaxia answers] (1) Men and women living together can separate. Once separated, the two parties are no longer related. (2) A widow can remarry according to the law.

(2) Family Mutual Aid

Fu Weihao asks: I am an adopted son. When I was seven years old, I was adopted by Mr. Jia due to poverty. My foster mother is fierce and cruel. I have been abused since I was a child.

I am now twenty-four years old and work in a factory, earning more than 100,000 yuan a month, and the lives of my family of several people depend on me. I have several legal questions, please answer them: (1) If my monthly income is limited and I cannot afford to support my parents, is it a crime? (2) My foster father has a fixed job and considerable income. Can I ask him for financial assistance? If my "foster mother" does not agree, is there any way? (3) If my foster father dies unfortunately, does the adopted son have inheritance rights to all the real estate? (4) As I am in charge of the household expenses, can I request equal distribution of the ancestral property?

[Lawyer Cao Yaxia answers] (1) It is not a crime, because the law stipulates the extent of support should be determined according to the needs of the person entitled to support and the economic capacity and status of the person obligated to support. (2) Yes, because relatives have a mutual obligation to support each other. (3) If there are no other children and no will, then the "foster mother" and the "adopted son" should each receive one-half.

### Shanghai District Yarn Factories Joint Sales of Cotton Yarn Temporary Measures Approved in 8 Points The Principle of Exchanging Yarn for Cotton is Also Agreed

[Our Newspaper] The Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association held a board meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday and approved the 8 temporary measures for joint sales of cotton yarn by yarn factories in the Shanghai district. The measures agreed to the principle of exchanging yarn for cotton. The exchange ratio is roughly two bags of cotton yarn for one bag of cotton. The price of cotton yarn will imitate the method of the Central Bank's standard gold, taking on the nature, but the principle is to quote slightly lower than the market. It is heard that the 8 measures are still to be presented to the Board of Directors for implementation after approval.

### Kerosene Suddenly Soars to 30,000 Yuan Per Case

The kerosene used by the people in this city has recently suddenly soared. It is said that the kerosene panic is not caused by unscrupulous merchants monopolizing, but by the sudden rise in gold and banknotes. Therefore, the kerosene that was 20 yuan per catty at the time of victory jumped to 300, and then gradually rose to 400, 500, and 600. Yesterday's investigation showed that kerosene was no longer sold anywhere in this city. Even if there were a few allocations, the price reached 800 yuan per catty, nearly 30,000 yuan per case.

### Coal Briquette Evaluation

Social Affairs Bureau Holds Meeting

Coal Briquette Industry Drafts Proposal

[Our Newspaper] The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs has scheduled a meeting of the Coal Briquette Price Review Committee, the Fuel Management Committee, the Municipal Council, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry, and the Coal Briquette Retailers at 2:00 PM tomorrow. Representatives will be sent to participate at that time. It is heard that the coal briquette industry has drafted a proposal. It is recommended that the evaluation of coal briquette prices should be calculated based on the black market price of Yangquan dross and Jiaozuo dross, plus simple manufacturing costs. The standard for coal allocation should divide the coal briquette industry into five grades: A, B, C Upper, C Middle, and C Lower. The distribution tonnage should also be divided into five grades: eight tons, five tons, three tons, two tons, and one ton.

In addition, 3,500 tons of Hongji white coal from Vietnamese loading ports are being transported to Shanghai by coal merchants in this city, and the Fuel Management Committee intends to facilitate it. It is said that the cost of the batch of white coal is about HK$344.75 per ton, and the freight is HK$40 to HK$60 per ton. There is also a batch of Huainan coal, and coal merchants are also preparing to load it to Shanghai for emergency response.

### Coal Prices Rise Steadily

Although the civilian factories in the coal market have a partial allocation of bituminous coal, the volume of goods that are being smuggled is limited. Once purchased, the spot goods are once again lacking, and market prices are rapidly rising. The amount of Hongji briquettes arriving and their market prices remain stable. The sale of Jiaozao briquettes is quite good, and market prices steadily climb, exceeding the $800,000 mark. Additionally, door sales at coal stores have led to the coal briquettes, firewood, and charcoal seeing great increases in sales, due to the increased price of kerosene. Currently, each stack of coal briquettes sells for $18,000-22,000, each load of pine firewood sells for $12,000, each tree of firewood sells for $700, each load of steel charcoal sells for $40,000, and each load of pine charcoal sells for $30,000.

### Hong Kong Trade Decreases Sharply

[Hong Kong 16th] Since our government implemented the import and export trade license application law, the goods transported from Hong Kong to the mainland have decreased sharply. Merchants have reduced their foreign orders due to stagnant inventory sales. Recently, Hong Kong's import trade has decreased by 60%, and exports have decreased by 50%. In addition, amid the sound of Japanese yarn being transported to Hong Kong for relief, Indian cloth is also being shipped to Hong Kong in large quantities for dumping, and the price of yarn and cloth in Hong Kong has plummeted.

Since the Wuchang Tea Company has shipped more than 1,000 boxes of the most popular colorless Ping Shui Xin Da Bang to the United States on the Donpaniceta ship that sailed to the United States last week, the foreign tea market continues to purchase the above colors. Other teas of inferior quality are extremely difficult to sell, and the temperature of Wenzhou Xin Zhenmei is gradually increasing, and the price has also been squeezed up. As for the high-end Chen Qimen, which British export companies have been paying close attention to, the market trend remains silent due to sellers’ single-minded focus on the fact that their goods are rare commodities. Domestic sales of black and green teas are still exhausted, and popularity is declining frequently.

### Temporary Measures for Goods Transported from Hong Kong and Macau to Guangdong are Established

The Yuehai Customs Commissioner's Office has announced that all goods imported must be inspected for import licenses in accordance with the revised import and export trade regulations. To facilitate the processing and avoid the suspension of goods transported from Hong Kong and Macau to the province, temporary measures have been developed in consultation with representatives of the Provisional Import Management Committee in Guangzhou. The temporary measures are as follows: (1) From November 21 of this year to December 31 of the same year, for all goods that are allowed to be imported from Hong Kong and Macau, an import application must first be submitted to the designated bank in this city, and a temporary import license must be issued by each bank and sent to customs for inspection before being allowed to be imported. From January 1, 1947, all goods imported from Hong Kong and Macau must be handled in accordance with the various provisions of the revised import and export trade regulations. (2) If the importer is unable to complete the application registration procedures due to time constraints, they may issue a guarantee to the designated bank in this city, guaranteeing that after the goods enter the country, they will apply for a temporary import license from the designated bank in accordance with the regulations and send it to customs for supplementary inspection.

The Shanghai market for Tung Oil, a product of specific dimensions, is frozen. According to industry experts, the price of Tung Oil at the place of origin is almost the same as that of Shanghai. If interest and freight are added, it would be much higher than the current price in Shanghai. As a large amount of Tung Oil from the place of origin is continuously transported to Guangzhou for sale, Shanghai has become a non-exporting coast. Therefore, the market price of Tung Oil in Shanghai is more than 140,000 yuan per load, which is only the retail price in stores. The arrival of goods is becoming increasingly rare, and trading is virtually suspended. Several businesses that undertake the export of Tung Oil have temporarily announced an end to operations to avoid excessive burdens. Currently, the price of Tung Oil in Zhejiang and Anhui is also the same as that in Shanghai, and freight and shoulder carrying, etc., are almost one-fifth to two-fifths of the value of the Tung Oil itself, so coming to Shanghai is a minority of a minority. It is also heard that the trend of hoarding Tung Oil in the mainland is quite intense, because the foreign price is not very good, while the degree of increase in the mainland is slightly better than that of the commonly known high-interest lending, which is also an abnormal phenomenon.

### Soybean Cake Continuously Shipped to Taiwan

[Our Newspaper Report] Yesterday, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Hai Qian" vessel sailed to Taiwan, carrying over three thousand two hundred bags of soybeans, twenty thousand one hundred and fifty pieces of soybean cake, four hundred and seventy-seven pieces of textiles, and two hundred and eighty-eight pieces of cotton yarn, destined for Keelung. Additionally, the "Hai Kang" vessel sailed to Qingdao yesterday, loaded with a large batch of tea leaves totaling over one thousand four hundred and fifty boxes, and six hundred and sixty pieces of cotton, which was American cotton.

Yesterday, the sugar market saw fluctuations due to financial instability and a tightening trend. The guild set the spot price for refined white sugar at 138,500 yuan per unit and raw red sugar at 121,200 yuan, an increase of 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Guangdong merchants offered "Runde Qing Gao" at 100,300 to 102,000 yuan, and the secondary grade at 98,000 yuan, totaling over four hundred packages. Hainan red sugar was offered at 115,000 yuan for over a hundred packages, and thin slices of green sugar at 83,000 yuan for over forty boxes. Xinghua white sugar was offered at 133,400 yuan, and Xinghua red sugar at 121,300 to 124,000 yuan, totaling over a hundred baskets. Nali white sugar was offered at 136,000 yuan for nine packages, and Shantou refined green sugar was quoted at 110,000 yuan. The asking price for high-quality Diaogreen goods was 100,400 yuan, with ordinary goods offered at 100,000 yuan.

### Woolen Fabrics Show Mixed Trends

Melton cloth is expected to be shipped less frequently in the future, and the existing American stock has been gradually depleted. Although the current stock in Shanghai is not lacking, those with financial strength are secretly trying to raise prices. Except for high-quality British-made overcoat fabrics, which are in short supply and rising in price, the rest are generally weak, both overtly and covertly, creating a situation of oversupply. Fancy woolen fabrics like Xuanwei are seeing downstream demand for both high-quality and low-quality goods. Serge is affected by the large influx of American goods being dumped on the market, and all brands are taking a hit. Gabardine in navy blue and grass green is not performing well. Yellow woolen cloth is affected by blankets, and the Ting River brand is declining daily. Except for some minor demand from Changsha and Sichuan, straight-grained woolen cloth is selling slowly, leading to sluggish prices. Camel hair and cavalry twill are selling slower than in previous years, and prices are generally flat. Domestic and imported women's woolen fabrics are in excessive supply, and due to seasonal factors, they are all continuing to fall in price. Only suit linings remain relatively stable.

### The Four Banks Joint Treasury Modifies the Method of Export Goods Loan Pledge

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] The Four Banks Joint Treasury previously approved the "Central Bank Measures for Handling Export Material Loans, Re-pledges, and Remittances" to support domestic production and promote export trade. Now, in order to meet actual needs, the name of the above measures has been amended to "Central Bank Measures for Handling Export Foreign Material Loans, Re-pledges, and Discounting," and Article 3 of the original measures has been amended to: "The original pledge period should be based on the actual time required for sorting, packaging, or refining, etc., but should not exceed ninety days. The discounting period depends on transportation conditions. For documentary discounting, except for Qingdao, Tianjin, Yichang, and Shashi, which should not exceed twenty-five days, and Chongqing, which should not exceed thirty days, other locations should not exceed twenty days."

### Adjusting the Lineup and Borrowing Players to Fight, the Qingbai Club Team and the Army United Team, the South China Basketball Team Have No Opponents, Four Wins in Four Games

(Our newspaper, Hong Kong Air Mail) In the last newsletter, it was said that the Qingbai football team should adjust its lineup if it wants to win the remaining three games in Hong Kong. In the game against the Army United team on the 11th, because Cao Qiuting and Zhuo Shijin were "borrowed," the front line was strengthened. Although Xu Wenkui was unable to play due to a cold, they still won a big victory with a score of three to one, and their reputation was greatly enhanced. It is expected that the game against the elite South China team on the 13th will stir up the world of fans even more.

Borrowing players to fight the Army United team, Qingbai Club sends good news

The Army United team is full of Westerners, all of them are brave, and their skills are not bad. The front line is very active. If Qingbai Club had not brought Yan and Wu to guard the gate, the outcome might have changed. The Qingbai Club and the Army United team’s lineup are:

(Qingbai Team)

Qin Biwan, Yan Shixin, Wu Qixiang, Qu Yongfu, Meng Yiliang, Gao Baozheng, Cao Qiuting, Luo Shoufu, Li Yangchen, Song Lingsheng, Zhuo Shijin

(Army United)

Bower, Stewart, Timmis, Sembas, Colets, Cashman, Ford, McMahon, Jones, Stickland, and Hirkey

Match Schedule: Qingbai took advantage of the tailwind in the first game and launched frequent attacks. After ten minutes, Yichen took the opportunity to shoot and scored the first goal (1-0). Not long after, Zhuo Shijin crossed from the right, and Luo Shoufu arrived in time and swept the ball in (2-0). After that, the ball went back and forth, and neither side gained anything. At the end of the first half, Qingbai took the lead.

Changing positions and fighting again, the Army United team gained the tailwind position and launched a counterattack. The Qingbai Club's goal was always in danger. Coach Li Yichen’s foot injury worsened, which was equivalent to playing with ten people. He had a whim and immediately changed the formation, with Lingsheng playing as the center forward, Shijin playing as the right forward, and himself guarding the right wing. At this time, the competition was fierce. However, Shijin got the ball and dribbled past two defenders, and went straight to the goal, and he succeeded in capturing a city. (3-0) Five minutes before the end of the game, the Army United team took advantage of a corner kick, and the Qingbai Club's goal fell into chaos. "Stickland" "stole a chicken" and launched a cold arrow. Qin Bi suddenly did not guard against it, and was scored a goal (3-1). Not long after, the whistle blew and the Qingbai Club played a triumph.

Basketball Meets a Strong Team and Wins South China by Three Points

The Qingbai football players have played two games in Hong Kong, one loss and one win. They are not discouraged by the loss, and they are steady and steady. They are not proud of the victory, and they fight to the end. In the eyes of Hong Kong fans, they have gained a very satisfactory impression. If they can defeat South China tomorrow, they will be even more popular, there is no doubt. However, the unsoundness of the front line is always the flaw of the Qingbai Club. Tomorrow's Chen Rong will inevitably have changes.

In basketball, Qingbai Club has won three games in three matches. On the 10th, they met the Hong Kong elite South China team. The two teams were evenly matched, and Qingbai Club won by only three points. Cai Wenhua, the hero of the Qingbai Club, only scored ten points due to the close surveillance of the opponent. (Special reporter Zi Jian)

Basketball is more lively and football is less exciting

[Our newspaper, Hong Kong, 13th] In the past few days, Qingbai Club has played two games in Hong Kong, one in basketball and one in football, and both have won. Although the Qingbai Club defeated the South China football team led by the king of football Li Huitang with a score of two to zero in the football match against South China on the 13th, the players on both sides were either injured or absent due to other reasons, and the game was not exciting at all. On the other hand, basketball is getting more and more lively, and it is a bit eclipsed.

As of the 11th, the Qingbai Club basketball team in Hong Kong has successively played against the Youth Association, the Black Cat, South China, and the Self-Reliance teams, and has won four games in a row. However, the Hong Kong basketball players are continuing to work hard and are catching up. In the battle with South China, the Qingbai Club won by only three points. In the battle with Self-Reliance, the victory or defeat was almost indistinguishable. In the end, they lost to the Qingbai Club by one point, and the fans kept yelling that it was not worth it. If the Qingbai Club are a little careless, then the final drama of one football and one basketball game (the 15th and 16th) may end in a "Waterloo" and leave Hong Kong with regret.

The tense basketball game defeated Self-Reliance by one point

First, let’s record the basketball game between Qingbai and Self-Reliance on the 11th: Self-Reliance is the champion team in Hong Kong. The atmosphere of the whole game was really tense, exciting and warm. At the beginning of the game, both sides calmed down. Self-Reliance used a man-to-man defense, which made Cai Wenhua unable to use his skills. Then, Zhang Shutang of Self-Reliance fouled, and Zhang Shaoqing did not score the goal. Soon, Zhenxuan showed his power and scored the first point with a side shot. Shaoqing was not effective, and although he had a chance to break into the basket alone, he finally missed the shot at the bottom of the basket. In the sound of fighting again, after Zhang Shutang failed to score a goal at the bottom of the basket, he finally made a comeback and scored a goal. At this point, Qingbai called a timeout and sent Chen Qingjiang and Zhang Yuyi to replace Zhang Shaoqing and Cai Jindian. Then, He Lide scored a goal at the bottom of the basket, and Cai Wenhua scored a long shot, chasing the score to a 4-4 tie. But before the end of the first quarter, Zhenxuan made another long shot, creating a situation in which Self-Reliance led by 6-4.

In the second quarter, Lu Dezhang of Self-Reliance arrived and replaced Pan Yaojun. After Fang Ruoshan missed a chance at the bottom of the basket, Wenhua made a 6-6 tie. But after that, Self-Reliance’s momentum was fierce. With a series of shots and free throws, they created a good situation of 16 points. It was not until before the halftime whistle that Cai Wenhua made a long shot and scored two more points for Qingbai. In the first half, Self-Reliance took the lead with 16-8.

Self-Reliance should not have, and should never have, used Chen Yaoning and Lei Zhaoyuan, two new players, at the beginning of the second half. Qingbai took the opportunity to catch up. After Dezhang scored a point, Chen Qingjiang made a series of shots and free throws, scoring three points. Cai Wenhua made three consecutive shots. Although Lu Dezhang tried hard to score another point, Qingbai’s round of rapid attacks had already chased the score to 15-12. Self-Reliance then hurriedly called a timeout and replaced Fang Ruoshan and Gao Jiahe. But at that time, Qingbai’s momentum was like a rainbow and could not be replicated. They were chased back to a 20-20 tie. When the whistle blew, Zhen Zheng fouled and was penalized one ball, which was left to be executed in the fourth quarter, ending the third quarter.

In the fourth quarter, after Chen Qingjiang scored a goal, Qingbai took the lead by one point for the first time. Although Fang Ruoshan also scored back one point with a free throw shortly after, Wenhua scored another point soon after. After that, Self-Reliance seemed to have a chance to win again. After Shijie scored a shot and Ruoshan scored a free throw, they once led by 27-23. However, after Pan Yaojun missed a free throw, Ma Canxi and Zhang Shaoqing each scored a goal, making the score 27-24. At this time, Zhenxuan left the field due to cramps. Although Lu Dezhang scored two points with a long shot, time was not on their side. Self-Reliance finally lost by one point with a score of 26-27. The scores of both sides are as follows:

Qingbai Team Shot Penalty Foul Score

Zhang Shaoqing 1 0 2 2

Cai Wenhua 5 0 0 10

Cai Jinhuang 0 0 0 0

He Lide 1 1 1 3

Zhang Yuyi 3 0 1 6

Ma Canxi 1 0 2 2

Chen Qingjiang 1 2 1 4

Total 12 3 7 27

Self-Reliance Team Shot Penalty Foul Score

Lu Zhenxuan 2 0 2 4

Fang Ruoshan 1 2 1 4

Zhang Shutang 2 2 0 6

Li Shijie 1 0 0 2

Gao Jiahe 1 1 2 3

Pan Xiaojun 0 0 1 0

Lu Dezhang 3 1 1 7

Chen Yaoning 0 0 0 0

Ren Zongchao 0 0 0 0

Lei Zhaoyuan 0 0 0 0

Total 10 6 7 26

Looking at the overall situation, Self-Reliance could have won but did not, and Qingbai was cautious. Hong Kong basketball talents are really not weak, and it would be a big mistake for Qingbai to be "arrogant."

Li Huitang played but South China still suffered a setback

In the football game (13th), Qingbai defeated South China by a score of 2-0. Zhu Yongqiang and Zou Wenzhi of South China were originally scheduled to return to Hong Kong from Guangzhou yesterday to participate in the game, but unfortunately the train broke down on the way, causing them to "miss the game." Tan Zhenqian and Li Huitang were temporarily pulled up to play, so the lineup was slightly changed from before. Qingbai’s request to borrow Zhang Jinhai was approved by the Football Association, and the front line was adjusted again, which was stronger than when Li Yichen was the center forward. The lineups of both sides are as follows:

(South China Club)

Hua Ji, Lin Rushun, Zeng Zhongyun, Luo Weiquan, Liang Rongzhao, Xie Jinhong, Li Shuoyou, Tan Zhenqian, Li Huitang, Chen Dehui, Xie Jinhe

(Qingbai Club)

Qin Bigao, Yan Shixin, Wu Qixiang, Qu Yongfu, Meng Yiliang, Gao Baozheng, Cao Qiuting, Luo Shoufu, Zhang Jinhai, Song Lingsheng, Xu Wenkui

The South Qing match had no exciting performance. Although South China lost, the time to take the initiative accounted for 75% of the entire game. Qingbai only had a few deep opportunities, and several shots either hit the post or went offside. The first goal it won was in the 20th minute of the first half. Qiuting’s sideline cross was not intended to be a shot. With the help of the wind, it broke the record. Hua Ji lacked judgment and failed to save it in time, causing it to be missed. Qingbai’s victory in this game was after South China’s fierce attack failed. South China’s combat mood was quite affected.

Only two minutes after the start of the second half, Qingbai launched another raid. The South China defense failed to return in time. Qiuting and Wenkui’s left and right long passes and Jinhai’s breakthrough in the middle finally resulted in Jinhai shooting the second goal within a dozen yards in front of the goal.

### No Champion Has Been Produced in the Third Group of the Jingwu Table Tennis Tournament; The Competition Will Continue at 7:00 Tonight

[Our newspaper] The fifth Jingwu Cup table tennis tournament’s third group started at 7:00 last night at the Jingwu Association Hall on the third floor of Cishu. Because there are seven people in this group, a single cycle should have a total of twenty-two games, so the finals have not yet been decided. It is expected that the voices of Zhang Shanda, Shui Hangao, and Wang Xingyuan are the highest for the championship and runner-up. It is said that Wu Zuochang, a Guangdong warrior in this group, was originally very hopeful, but unfortunately his skills were barren, so he was poisoned by Wang Xingyuan in the first battle. When he met Zhang Shanda again, although he tried his best, he lost again because his morale had been frustrated. However, although Wang Xingyuan won against Wu Zuochang in one battle, he lost to Lin Wanhua in the next battle. However, his offensive and defensive strategies seem to be inferior to those of Zhang and Shui. The result will be seen tonight. In this group, Zhang Shanda and Shui Hangao’s skills are comparable to each other. The battle situation yesterday was as follows: Zhang Shanda won four, Shui Hangao won three, Wang Xingyuan won two, Wu Zuochang won two and lost two, Liu Jiarong won one and lost three, Lin Wanhua lost four, and Li He lost three. The competition will continue at the same place at 7:00 tonight, and there will be a fierce battle.

### Dahua Gave Up the Morning Friends Cup Again

In yesterday's three games of the fifth Morning Friends Cup basketball tournament, the Youai Blue team of Yiyou department won the Yong’an Blue team by a score of 18-10 in the first game of Group B. In the second game of the Yibei department, Ronglian defeated Qianghua 34-21. The last game was between the Dahua team of the Jiabu and the Shan team, but Dahua gave up again yesterday, and the Shan team won without labor. Dahua has given up twice, and according to the competition rules, it should be disqualified.

### The Ministry of Education Will Officially Establish the "Zhonghua Educational Radio Station" Next Year; University Courses May Be Broadcast Under the Name "Open University"

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 16th] In order to actively promote educational broadcasting, the Ministry of Education has prepared 1,000 radios for various provinces and cities. Regarding the Ministry's broadcasting efforts, although programs are currently scheduled and broadcast in phases through the Central Broadcasting Station each week, it is not as convenient as having its own educational radio station for broadcasting at any time. Therefore, it has been decided to establish its own educational radio station. In terms of name, since the Central Broadcasting Station already exists, to avoid duplication and confusion, it may be named "Zhonghua Educational Radio Station" in the future. The decision to establish this radio station has been made, and broadcasting equipment has already been ordered from the United States. Because it needs to be tailored to China's broadcasting needs, it requires one longwave and two shortwave transmitters. Currently, there are no ready-made products in the United States, and it needs to be newly manufactured. The Ministry of Education has been consulted for its opinions, and the Ministry is currently designing blueprints to be sent to the United States for manufacturing. It is expected that it will be shipped to China next year, and our Ministry of Education will then be able to officially establish the "Zhonghua Educational Radio Station" to broadcast educational news for the long term. This will not only promote social education but also gradually make it possible to broadcast secondary school courses and various university courses. For example, at a designated time, a certain type of textbook will be broadcast, and anyone with a radio can listen to the broadcast lectures. University students can listen to lectures by teachers through the radio, and those who are employed and wish to take university courses can also listen to the radio station as a form of part-time study. It is understood that this radio station may be named "Open University."

Civil Affairs Briefing

### The Joint Guarantee and Joint Liability System for Opium Suppression in This City Has Been Changed to Be the Responsibility of the Heads of Households

The Ministry of the Interior believes that the handling of joint guarantee and joint liability for opium suppression should be based on the spirit of rewarding and punishing, with the goal of achieving the requirements of opium prohibition as the main focus. The situation in Shanghai is special, and it is difficult to handle the matter through the Baojia system. Permission has been granted to first change the responsibility to the heads of households. However, Baojia personnel should still find ways to overcome difficulties in drug suppression work, and complete it in accordance with the law, taking responsibility at each level, and strictly enforce joint punishment to demonstrate thoroughness and promote opium prohibition. This has been telegraphed to the municipal government for dissemination.

The Fourteenth District Is Planning Winter Relief

The Fourteenth District (Zhabei) District Office recently held an enlarged district administration meeting, attended by district office personnel and district representatives, including Mu Shihai. Representatives from various agencies in the district and city councilor Wei Yunqing also attended the meeting. Chaired by District Chief Wang Zhiping, several important cases were resolved. Regarding the Shandong, Anhui, and Northern Jiangsu refugees staying in the district, estimated to be over 30,000 people, all of whom are without clothing or food, it has been decided to petition the Relief Committee to establish a Zhabei branch, and to request the allocation of more old clothing and flour for relief. It is also planned to establish a winter shelter at the Zhongfu Silk Factory in the district to investigate the poor people in each Bao who urgently need relief. Regarding the shacks built along the railway lines near power poles and transportation areas, the removal process was determined to be handled by Feng Dianbao and five others after consultation, and a request was submitted to the relevant authorities.

The Thirteenth District Will Publish a Weekly Newspaper

The Thirteenth District (Putuo) District Office, in order to promote autonomy and facilitate public opinion, plans to create a weekly newspaper, tentatively named "Min Zhong" (People's Bell). After discussion and decision by the Bao Chief meeting, it is said that the chief executive of the district, Gao Shaoying, is planning to prepare a proposal for submission to the preparatory committee for approval and implementation.

### Shaoxing: A City of Culture and Antiquities

—10th Dispatch, Our Correspondent Huang Xingtian

Let's rescue the ancient ship "Shaoxing," not only preventing it from sinking but also enabling it to carry the people of Shaoxing to the realm of happiness!

Shaoxing is a city of culture and antiquities. In recent years, well-known figures such as Qiu Jin, Cai Yuanpei, Shao Lizi, and Lu Xun were all born in Shaoxing. The Mausoleum of Yu the Great, where "the virtues of rulers are pondered between the rivers Huai and Han, and the heart of Dao is seen in the subtlety of thought," is also located in Shaoxing. The Grand Historian Sima Qian "explored the tomb of Yu and climbed Mount Kuaiji," and Qing emperors also used the nine-bow ritual to pay their respects at the mausoleum. This shows that it is truly an extraordinary sacred place. Although Gu Jiegang once said from the perspective of new historiography that "Yu was a worm," in the eyes of most people, Yu was indeed a virtuous ruler who served the people wholeheartedly and was loved by them, especially the descendants of Yu with the surname Si residing near the Mausoleum of Yu.

Superficial Prosperity, Inner Emptiness

In terms of products, Shaoxing's "laojiao" (aged rice wine), freshwater fish, Ping Shui tea, and fragrant cakes are all well-known. Even in the "underworld" (if there is such a world), Shaoxing enjoys a good reputation because it produces large quantities of tin foil, which is sold throughout the country. It is not an exaggeration to say that Shaoxing is a city of culture and antiquities. However, Shaoxing City is now much smaller than before, and it is declining day by day. Mr. Shao Hongshu, the principal of Shaoxing Kuaiji Middle School, told the reporter, "Shaoxing is like a big ship that is gradually sinking! Ping Shui tea leaves are rotting in piles because they cannot be exported. Huangjiu (yellow rice wine) and tin foil cannot raise their heads due to high interest rates and heavy taxes. Even the 'shiye' (private secretaries) are degenerating. The number of middle school students, the material for creating shiye, is also gradually decreasing, and the level of national education is inevitably declining..." Mr. Shao shook his head and sighed as he said this.

This time, our reporter in Hangzhou, led by Mr. Chu Yusheng, the general manager of the "Zhejiang Provincial Capital Foreign Correspondent Association," visited Shaoxing. At first glance, the city still looks very prosperous. The streets and alleys, although slightly narrow, are cleaner and flatter than those in Hangzhou. After nightfall, the lights are brilliant, and the shops on both sides of the street compete for customers. Banners with "big sale" are flying in the wind, and some have even built special colorful arches. There are also many customers coming to the stores. However, after asking several shops, their total business volume is not large, only making two or three hundred thousand [currency units] per day. The profit of small merchants is often not enough to offset the high interest rates of two or three cents. Recently, seven or eight old shops with more than ten years of history have also been forced to close down. According to the Chamber of Commerce, many more stores will be forced to close during the New Year and Spring Festival. The tide of closure has reached Shaoxing, and many old owners are frowning and worrying about the end of the year! A Shaoxing colleague said to the reporter with emotion, "Don't look at the prosperity on the streets. Their insides are very empty. The prosperity is only superficial, only a 'last flicker of glory' for Shaoxing's market!"

The Lifeline of the Economy: The Foil Industry in Crisis

The general business situation is like this, and so is the brewing industry and the tin foil manufacturing industry, which are Shaoxing's special products. The tin foil industry, in particular, seems to have reached its dangerous end. Tin foil is essentially a product of superstition, but the deep penetration of Buddhism into Chinese folk customs has enabled the tin foil industry in Shaoxing to flourish. They transport tin materials from Yunnan, Jiangxi, and other provinces, beat them into thin sheets, and grind and plate them on the deer-calling paper produced in Xiaoshan and Fenghua counties to make coins and ingots for burning incense and offering sacrifices. It originated in the Hongwu period of the Ming Dynasty and has a history of more than 500 years. Before the war, it produced 3 million pieces per year, most of which were exported. Therefore, it is a lifeline of the local economy. Later, because the government strictly restricted the development of superstitious industries, the output gradually decreased sharply. After the Anti-Japanese War, transportation was blocked and exports became a big problem. Since the victory, internal strife has not ceased, and the sales channels in the north have still not been opened. The annual output is now only a few hundred thousand pieces, less than one-three-hundredth of what it used to be! Moreover, according to people familiar with Shaoxing's commercial situation, "Now the export cost of cigarettes in Shaoxing is offset by the import cost of tin foil." Therefore, the tin foil industry can no longer be the lifeline of Shaoxing's local economy. However, 240,000 people in Shaoxing directly or indirectly rely on it for a living. Although the tin foil industry is only a household handicraft industry, with only a dozen larger foil shops in the county, most of them are dedicated technical workers, except for some women who regard it as a side business. Recently, an even greater crisis has come before them. That is, the military's smuggling is becoming more and more rampant. The original tax on tin foil was 25%, which accounted for 60% of the total business tax revenue in Zhejiang Province, which shows the abundance of tax revenue. Now it has been changed to a goods tax, which is under the central government, and has been increased to 80% since October 1. Later, because merchants and people could not bear the heavy burden, the tax rate was reduced to 60%. Ordinary wandering soldiers gathered in teams of six or seven people, forcibly used vehicles, and smuggled with weapons, evading heavy taxes and making huge profits. They became even more active in November, and the Goods Tax Bureau had to ask the Security Command to send a platoon (30 people) to suppress smuggling. However, they still used violent means to break through the tax gates. Their reason is, "It's already good enough that we're not bandits." They also threatened, "If you open fire to stop us, then not only will you bleed, but Shaoxing City will be finished!" Therefore, Director Yuan of the department in charge said painfully, "In order to maintain law and order and avoid being used by others, we have to endure it. As a result, the total revenue for more than two months has been only over 1 billion [currency units]. According to the budget, there should be 12 billion in tax revenue per year!" The reporter went to see the tax gate area and found that, indeed, in the evening and at dusk, lawless soldiers were pushing trucks through. Large trucks of tin foil were lightly smuggled out of the city in this way, and sold cheaply in Zhuji and Hangzhou foil shops, making the foil price show no signs of improvement, affecting legitimate merchants and factory owners, and putting foil shops in a new crisis of total collapse! Shaoxing has a population of 820,000, so one-third of the people may be completely unemployed in this new crisis, without food to eat. The manufacture of tin foil was originally a superstitious industry, and its collapse is not a pity; but the unemployment of one-third of the population will cause much social unrest and chaos, which is the most serious problem. And the key to this problem, like the key to the abolition of rickshaws in Hangzhou, is mainly the problem of changing careers. The rickshaw pullers in Hangzhou are mostly silk factory workers. To abolish rickshaws, you must first restore the silk factories and let them return to their "hometown." The tin foil industry belongs to superstition, which is prohibited by law, but the way out for workers to change careers is a big problem. Rural areas? The brewing industry? Neither can accommodate them, and it is not feasible. Recently, seven relevant foil industry unions in Shaoxing held a joint meeting and, as a result, "Since science has developed to the atomic age, we are willing to jump out of the superstitious factories." Therefore, they launched a career change movement, requesting the central government to allocate three-tenths of the total foil tax revenue to be used as career change funds for foil workers. This will certainly reduce the central government's fiscal revenue, but in order to accelerate the abolition of superstition and relieve the suffering of the people, this may not be a bad idea!

Tea Rotting, Tea Farmers Crying, Tea Merchants Sighing Secretly

Shaoxing is also the tea production center of the Ping Shui area. The green pearl tea here used to sell well abroad. Before the war, Zhejiang's export tea reached 200,000 [units], accounting for one-third of the country's tea exports, and Ping Shui tea sold the best. The tea garden area in the area is more than 200,000 mu, and the total output reaches more than 200,000 [units]. However, after years of war destruction, traffic was cut off, rural areas were destroyed, and output was sharply reduced. After the national restoration, tea farmers and tea merchants re-established their old businesses. However, after the war, people's livelihoods declined, funds dried up, and even if they pooled their resources, they could not restore Ping Shui tea. The Agricultural Bank of China provided 2.2 billion in tea loans, but because the funds arrived late and costs rose sharply, and the United States restricted the price of Chinese tea, foreign sales were bleak, and they could only watch Japan, India, and Ceylon dump low-cost tea on the international market while letting green pearl tea rot in the Ping Shui area! This year, the factories purchased 27,600 dan of raw tea, only one-fifth of what it was before the war; if the tea production this year is calculated at one-third, there are also 41,400 dan left in the hands of tea farmers, unable to be exchanged for rice! Shaoxing currently has 24 tea factories, and this year, it purchased no more than 15,100 dan of raw tea. Due to a shortage of capital, a large amount of tea cannot be made into finished products, causing tea farmers to cry, tea leaves to rot, and tea merchants to sigh secretly! High interest rates not only block the tea industry but also erode the silk industry. Shaoxing silk production, like Hangzhou silk and Wuxing silk, is one of the three silk production centers in Zhejiang Province. Now, it is declining like Hangzhou, and even the high-speed weaving machines have not been restored. No wonder the people of Shaoxing no longer say "Oh, Shaoxing's essays are the best in the world," but instead exclaim: "High interest rates kill people the most!"

Many Deposits in the County Treasury, Difficult to Collect Sufficient Land Tax

In terms of politics, since Lin Ze became the head of Shaoxing, it is said that because the local area can cooperate with the government, political affairs have been promoted quite well. Although financial expenditures are large, the county treasury still has 40 million yuan in addition to land tax. However, the collection of land tax in kind will still be implemented for the first time this year. Collection began on November 1. Because landlords are slow to collect rent, transportation is inconvenient, and, more importantly, the number of land and grain households is as high as 530,000, three times larger than the actual number of households. Many grain accounts have no landlords to collect, and less than 20% has been collected so far (the total tax amount for the county is 860,000 yuan, or 230,000 dan). It would be very satisfactory if 50% could be collected before the end of the year. It is impossible to meet the central government's deadline.

Reading Shaoxing Newspapers Is Like Drinking Plain Water

Shaoxing is known for its shiye (private secretaries), so Shaoxing's culture should be very developed, but due to the limitations of various social relationships, Shaoxing's cultural circles are much worse than those in Hangzhou, the provincial capital. Shaoxing now has three daily newspapers, the "Shaoxing Republic Daily" of the county party department and the "Shaoxing News" and "Yue Bao," which are run by merchants, all of which are open to one page. Because Hangzhou newspapers can arrive at 9:00 a.m. on the same day, and Shanghai newspapers can arrive at 3:00 p.m., the sales volume of local newspapers is limited to about 2,000 copies. But the most important thing is that each newspaper does not have a certain characteristic. The president of Yue Bao put it well: "Because Shaoxing's newspapers (1) have no definite goal and cannot exert a spiritual stimulating effect, (2) dare not criticize reality, and (3) focus on urban areas and neglect rural areas, they cannot go deep into the people and breathe with the people." So, reading one is like reading the second, and even this one is "drinking plain water!" The only regular publications are the "Youth Guidance News" of the Youth Army, the "Children's Friend" of the Youth League, the "Shaoxing Education" of the County Education Section, and the "Children's Weekly," none of which are general readings; in addition, there are three regular newspapers such as "Shao Bao," which are tabloids, but some of them sell better than the big newspapers! Low-level tastes are popular, which is not unique to Shanghai.

Leaflets and Lawsuits Were Thrown at Reporters

Writing this, I remember an interesting drama. When the reporter group was resting in the County Chamber of Commerce, a soldier suddenly walked in and handed us "leaflets," accusing the Youth League, through "Xu Jun," of forcibly closing the "Juemin Theater" he was running and turning it into the "Youth Theater," appealing to us. It was as if small people were stopping officials' sedan chairs to file lawsuits, simply regarding us news reporters as judges, making us feel flattered. In the afternoon, when the tea party hosted by County Chief Lin was held in the same place, a worker handed in another "lawsuit," in which a woman named "Miao Mushan" "respectfully appealed to all reporters" to accuse "Xu Jun, the councilor of the Third Regiment" of forcibly occupying civilian houses. Two "cases," with "Xu Jun" caught in the middle, the latter was obviously a counterattack. We are not judicial officials after all and cannot make a judgment, so we had to ask County Chief Lin to explain. It is said that the "Juemin Theater" was run by the officers' regiment, and because it did not pay rent, the landlord subleased it to the Youth League as the site of the Youth Theater. There was a rental agreement, and the Youth League had already paid the "Juemin Theater" 2 million [currency units] twice for the sublease fee. This time, "Xu Jun" was asking for it for the third time. If another 2 million [currency units] were given, there would still be dozens of "Xu Jun" to trouble them and ask for the house. The implication was that "Xu Jun" was extorting money. But even the county chief could not handle this kind of dispute involving the military, so how could we reporters handle it? However, they all insisted on appealing to the reporters, which shows the importance that ordinary people attach to news reporters. What should especially alert us, especially Shaoxing's colleagues, is that "Shaoxing is like a big ship that is gradually sinking!" As reporters, the mouthpiece of the people of Shaoxing, we should call on the people of Shaoxing, guide the people of Shaoxing, and do everything in our power to assist the government in rescuing the ancient ship "Shaoxing," not only preventing it from sinking but also enabling it to carry the people of Shaoxing to the realm of happiness!

### Adding Glory to the Motherland! A Leaf in the Art World

—Paris Airmail, 3rd, Our Special Correspondent in Paris Wang Yizhi

The talent of the Chinese people has never been inferior to that of warriors. Nowadays, the domestic compatriots are facing economic hardship and a high cost of living. Although the enjoyment of material things may not be entirely satisfactory, from a spiritual point of view, it is fortunate that various parties and factions in our country are assisting the government in resisting the war with one heart and one mind, and have achieved success. This is truly a blessing from heaven. Recently, Chinese art celebrities at home and abroad have also been able to seize the opportunity, taking advantage of the UNESCO Scientific and Cultural Conference convened in Paris in November 1946, to gain great glory in the international arena. For example, the New Art Exhibition, The International Exhibition of Modern Art, organized by the Science and Cultural Bureau, was held in the Tokyo Building of the New Art Museum on President Wilson Avenue in the 16th arrondissement of Paris. Thirty countries participated, and commentators generally said that the works of France, Britain, the United States, and China were the most moving. Chinese painters also gained a superior position among the four powerful countries. Although the Chinese people are temporarily in difficulty, this spiritual tonic is like drinking tonic wine, and the future of the country is truly promising.

It is found that the items displayed by the Chinese Department were all flown in from China in time and were even better than the items previously exhibited in London. According to the reporter of the Continental Edition of the Daily Mail, among the Chinese works, Zhang Daqian's large-scale lotus pond, with its vast momentum, is the most commendable (i.e., the four pictures in the upper center of the attached picture). The two pictures on the left are Xu Beihong's horses and cattle written in Panxi, and the one on the right is Deng Baichun's flower and bird masterpieces from Guangdong. On the left and right are Yu Youren's (Zi Sheng), president of the Sino-French Association, cursive calligraphy of five couplets of stone carvings (the French translation is Calligraphie-parallele Poetique, the upper sentence "The past is extremely memorable," and the lower sentence "The distant mountains are friendly again"), which deeply add color to the whole venue. Other works, such as Qing Tianyou's white sketch portraits, Pan Yuliang's nude oil paintings, Shen Yinmo's inscription on Wu Zuoren's Tibetan tea picture, and Liao Xinxue's distant mountains, were all praised by Western newspapers. At the same time, Liao Xinxue's personal painting exhibition was also publicly displayed at the Galerie des Deuxlles, No. 1 Quai de la Mégisserie, Flower Market. Thirty or so fine works of landscapes, birds, and flowers were sold out. His No. 1 Flock of Wild Geese (as shown in the attached picture) was awarded an honorary prize for participating in the Paris Spring Art Exhibition and was not allowed to be sold. Liao's landscapes, with their misty clouds, were much loved by a Swiss person who bought many of them. Living in the mountains, they complemented each other perfectly. Other fine works in the Tokyo Building, such as Chen Shuren's kapok trees painted in Xishan, Chongqing, vividly express the scenery of southern China. Qi Baishi's cattle and flowers are bold and unrestrained, showing that he is getting stronger as he gets older. Wang Yachen, the principal of Xinhua School, painted goldfish vividly, with the inscription: "The wind turns and the clouds break, the rain is clear at first, the reflection on the pond is warm and bright again, the red fish are lively, and the new green water is spread flat." His writing is appropriate, and among the landscape paintings, it can be said to be a divine work, with none better than Huang Binhong's Maple Forest Walking with a Staff, with three poems inscribed. I love the second poem the most: "The empty pavilion is desolate with the flowing river, passing Hengtang to the west, the water is overflowing, the poetic thoughts cannot help but be good for the setting sun, the shadow of the green mountain falls on the small boat." Reciting this poem repeatedly, all the pain and sorrow in the world can be thrown to the winds. This is the wonderful use of Chinese characters, which cannot be compared with any Western language. Each work has a French translation, which is very convenient for visitors to view. It is a pity that the translated poems in the Chinese works do not retain the poetic charm of the Chinese text, so that the tourists who appreciate Chinese paintings, like the foreigners who visit Chinese scenic spots, cannot understand the joy of the spiritual enjoyment of the couplets and poems in front of them. At least the joy that the Chinese can experience is reduced by half. This is a great regret in the art world.

It is now heard that the Ministry of Education and Culture is planning to translate foreign literary works, as well as books published by private bookstores that are not easy to profit from, into English, French, and other languages and publish them quickly. Those intellectuals who bury themselves in translating poetry and other works, because these profound works are not for profit, may abandon their available positions and even sacrifice the money they could earn. The conference will also pay close attention to supporting their lives and the happiness of their families. If this is realized, it will truly benefit the future of mankind and not only revive the arts.

### Shaoxing Wine and Freshwater Fish

— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng, Hangzhou, 10th

Speaking of "Shaoxing Wine," its fame is truly resounding. I remember when I was in the Southwest rear area during the war, many foreign friends, while heartily drinking Moutai, once said to me, "When we get to your Zhejiang, we'll drink Shaoxing wine," a look of yearning overflowing their expressions. Indeed, Shaoxing wine doesn't have the bitterness of brandy or whiskey, nor the intensity of Moutai, and it’s not like beer, which you can drink for a long time without much reaction. Its aroma is very gentle, it tastes somewhat sweet, and its color is lighter than wine. A few small cups leave you pleasantly tipsy. I gave a brief introduction in my article "Walking Around Xiao and Shao" on August 25th, but the history of "Shaoxing Wine" really deserves a more detailed account.

The Tale of Bottle Mountain

During the Spring and Autumn period, King Goujian of Yue, while recuperating and training his troops, had a fine wine made in Yue to present to the state of Wu. Wu Zixu's army once drank this fine wine heartily in the Jiaxing and Jiashan areas. After drinking, the empty jars were piled up into a mountain, and the name "Bottle Mountain" still remains in He and Shan, passed down as a beautiful tale for thousands of years. Therefore, the history of Shaoxing wine should be almost two thousand years. Later, Shaoxing wine gradually became appreciated, and was sold in Jiang, Zhe, Min, Gan, and Wan provinces, and even to the capital of Beiping, as tribute to the emperor. The reputation of Shaoxing old wine grew greater. In every township and town in Shaoxing, almost every farming household brewed their own wine in small quantities. The largest wine-making areas were the Keqiao, Dongpu Village Head, and Zhangguali areas. There were large breweries there, and empty jars were piled up higher than houses, with large vats of wine lined up. According to Chen Disun, the chairman of the Shaoxing County Chamber of Commerce, "In the heyday, Shaoxing County's wine makers competed to produce, with probably more than 300,000 vats. Eight years ago, each large household would brew six to seven thousand vats." Each vat could fill ten jars of wine. Eighteen dou of glutinous rice could brew one vat of wine, and each jar of wine was generally about fifty jin. Breweries also produced some distilled spirits. After the wine was made, the leftover wine lees could be sold in the market, which was enough to offset the cost of labor and firewood.

Main Reason for Fame

The main ingredient for brewing wine is glutinous rice. This glutinous rice is not produced locally, but comes from Danyang, Jintan, Liyang in Jiangsu, and Jiaxing in this province. The pure and rich water quality of Jian Lake in Shaoxing is the main reason for Shaoxing wine's fame.

Among Shaoxing wines, the most famous at one time were the so-called Zhuangyuanhong, Jiafan, Zhuyeqing, Shanliang, and Huadiao. If the original jar is buried underground for more than ten years, the color and aroma of the wine will be even better. Many families in Jiangnan buried Shaoxing wine underground before the war, and after several years, they would take it out to entertain guests at weddings or banquets. In Shaoxing, many wealthy families would make one or two vats of wine after the birth of a daughter, seal them tightly, and bury them under the soil of the road that family members frequently walked. When the daughter got married, they would take it out to entertain guests. Some people called this wine "Daughter Wine."

Broken Jars and Empty Vats

During the Anti-Japanese War, exports of Shaoxing wine stagnated. The Japanese and puppet organizations stole the method of brewing Shaoxing wine, set up factories in Harbin, and dumped large quantities in North China, Northeast China, and Southeast Asia. In the Northwest and Southwest rear areas, some wine workers who had fled from Shaoxing also raised the banner of Shaoxing old wine and brewed Shaoxing wine locally to satisfy the longing and admiration of guests. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the traces left by the Japanese and puppets in Shaoxing regarding Shaoxing wine were broken jars and empty vats, piled up in a mess. Although many people have worked hard to revive it, it is not even one-tenth or one-twelfth of what it was before the war. According to a survey by the Shaoxing branch of the Commodity Tax Bureau, only 19,900 vats were brewed last year. After the autumn harvest last year, glutinous rice only sold for 5,000 yuan per shi, so the cost of rice for one vat of wine was only 9,000 yuan. The tax is calculated at 80% of the cost. However, this year, the price of each jar of wine is more than 30,000 yuan. In this way, the brewers can make a good profit, so there are especially many brewers this year, even willing to borrow at high interest rates to brew wine. However, this year the price of glutinous rice will be more than 60,000 or 70,000 yuan per shi, plus labor, firewood, and taxes, the price of wine must be raised very high. It is a question whether many people who love wine and are greedy for it will have the purchasing power.

Shaoxing Wine Society

Now many people in Shaoxing plan to transport Shaoxing wine across the ocean to the Western Hemisphere to compete with foreign wines. However, Shaoxing is not suitable for packaging. After packaging, it will precipitate. Only by covering the original jar with earthen jars and mud can the jars be sealed, but this seems too unmodern and uneconomical. If glass bottles or other packaging materials are used to pump out the air and store Shaoxing wine, then after burying or storing it for thousands of years, its quality will not improve. This cannot compete with brandy and other wines, which get better with age.

For the present, I think that all parts of the country should uniformly use domestic Shaoxing wine, and no longer need foreign wines. What cocktail parties are not as good as Shaoxing wine societies, so that Shaoxing wine can be active in the Chinese market, and the brewers of Shaoxing wine can have flexible funds; then the government or those with funds should use scientific methods to set up factories and study carefully, and then sell it abroad.

Fan Li Raises Fish

In addition to the famous old wine, Shaoxing is also famous throughout the country for its freshwater fish. During the Spring and Autumn Period, after the state of Yue defeated the state of Wu, Doctor Fan Li resigned and retired, and lived by raising fish in the rivers inside and outside Shaoxing. The fish gradually sold well, and Fan Li became very wealthy, gathering and dispersing his wealth three times. Everyone called him Tao Zhugong. The area of fish ponds in the county is more than 100,000 mu. When paddling a boat or motorboat through the inner river, there is a bamboo fence every less than a li. In the past heyday, the annual output could reach five to six million jin. Last year's output was only 500,000 jin. This year is better, with an output of one million jin.

Fisheries Organization

Shaoxing has a Fisheries Marketing Cooperative. According to the person in charge of the cooperative, "Because fishing grounds and fishing gear were mostly damaged during the war, and fishermen were also affected by high-interest loans, the fish, when it reaches the hands of customers, has to add more than ten times the exploitation. The marketing cooperative, in order to reduce this heavy exploitation, obtains the fish from the fishermen, so that it can be delivered to the customers more directly." On the contrary, some people are opposed to the Fisheries Marketing Cooperative. They say that this organization is a joint organization of "big bosses." The so-called "big bosses" are the leaders of many fishermen, who handle marketing affairs on their behalf. This person does not fish, nor does he need to work, but enjoys the benefits. In reality, they are not fishermen. Now the cooperative wants to tax the fish that passes through their organization, extracting ten jin of tax for every hundred jin. Some say they extract eight jin of tax, and others say they extract four or five jin of tax. In short, they want to extract tax. They believe that this kind of taxation is exploitation, so they are brewing opposition.

Cultivating Fish Fry

Although Shaoxing produces freshwater fish, its fish fry is transported from Jiujiang in Jiangxi to Linghe, and then from Linghe to Shaoxing. Now the people of Shaoxing are also paying attention to cultivating fish fry, but no one has thought about how to cultivate fish fry or which pond to choose for cultivation. I believe that today, cultivating fish fry is an urgent matter for Shaoxing's freshwater fish. If the cooperative only collects fish tax and does not serve the fishermen, this is not right. Therefore, the government should best send fisheries experts to Shaoxing to study suitable locations for cultivating fish fry, and at the same time enable fishermen to truly profit and customers to truly receive benefits.

Promising Future

At present, a sense of decadence and pessimism prevails in Shaoxing. Among their four major specialties, tin foil is a superstitious item and will be abolished sooner or later. There is no hope for exports of Pingshui tea, so there is naturally no way. Shaoxing wine and freshwater fish are also showing signs of decline. I say that except for tin foil, there are ways for all of them. Tea, Shaoxing wine, and freshwater fish, as long as they are studied and improved, they all have a very good future. In particular, Shaoxing wine and freshwater fish, both have more than 2,000 years of history, and are relics of King Goujian of Yue's recuperation and training. We should protect and develop them well. (On the way from Shao to Hang, 10th)

### Further Discussion on Zhejiang Water Conservancy Projects

— Mao Qi

(1) The stone embankment on the Jiang shore south of Fuyang City was washed away by flooding this spring for 50 meters, and the rest is also in imminent danger, urgently needing repair. After surveying by the Water Conservancy Bureau, the cost is estimated at 150 million yuan. A request has been submitted to the central government to allocate 50 million yuan, and the remaining funds will be raised locally. Funds are currently being raised to start repairs.

(2) The flood control projects for Fengqiao River and Baita Lake in Zhuji. The Water Conservancy Bureau has sent personnel to survey and design for the Fengqiao River, and the estimated cost is 81.1338 million yuan. It has been agreed to allocate 175,246 jin of flour from the Zhejiang-Fujian Branch to provide work relief, so construction can begin immediately. The Baita Lake improvement project is currently being surveyed and designed by the Water Conservancy Bureau.

The above four projects have all been submitted to the central government for allocation of funds. Except for the Fuyang City South Jiang shore project, which has already been allocated 50 million yuan, the rest have not yet been approved.

(3) The Jinhua River flood control project involves seven counties: Jinhua, Lanxi, Nanyang, Yiwu, Yongkang, Wuyi, and Tangxi. The Water Conservancy Bureau has sent personnel to conduct preliminary surveys and designs in conjunction with the Fourth Special District. The estimated cost is 400 million yuan. The Fourth Special District Office has convened relevant county party and government officials, public opinion organizations, and local people to form a water conservancy advisory committee and engineering office to conduct actual measurements and prepare for immediate construction.

(4) The Puyang River flows through Yiwu, Pujiang, Zhuji, and other counties. The riverbed has long been neglected, and mountain floods are frequent, resulting in poor drainage, and farmland on both sides is often submerged. It is proposed to first carry out emergency flood control projects to alleviate the symptoms, which are estimated to cost 150 million yuan.

It is also planned to submit these two projects to the central government for allocation of funds, and to apply to the Zhejiang-Fujian Branch for allocation of work relief materials, and to collect project beneficiary fees to handle them. In addition, there are flood control projects for the Xin'an River, Ling River, Ou River, Yong River, Feiyun River, and Bie River in the upper reaches of the Qiantang River, but due to limited manpower and financial resources, it is planned to hold them next year.

(5) The Xiaoshan Nansha Soil Protection Project. The Water Conservancy Bureau has sent personnel to survey and design. The first step is to build three training dikes to divert the flow of water, which is estimated to cost 1.7 billion yuan. Applications are being made to the central government and the Zhejiang-Fujian Branch for allocation of funds and materials in order to start construction.

Agricultural Irrigation Projects

This province has successfully carried out agricultural irrigation projects during the war to cooperate with agricultural production and supply military provisions and civilian food. However, due to difficult circumstances and meager expenses, the projects have not been implemented according to plan, or there are many places where the projects have been implemented and then stopped. This year, they should continue to be carried out to completion. They are divided into large and small categories, which are described as follows:

Large Agricultural Irrigation Projects

(A) Linhai Taozhu District Irrigation Project: The dredging project in this area has completed 300,000 cubic meters of earthwork in previous years, and the Donggang Gate has also been partially constructed. This year, due to the suspension of water conservancy taxes and the lack of funds, the project has been suspended. After redesign, the projects in Jiaobei and Nantian districts are combined, with a total estimated cost of 895 million yuan. A special project has been submitted to the central government for approval of 350 million yuan, and it has been agreed to allocate 247,580 pounds of flour from the Zhejiang-Fujian Branch in advance. Work can be resumed in the short term, and more than 100,000 mu of farmland will benefit after completion.

(B) Pingyang Nangang District Drainage Project: This area is located on the south bank of the Bie River in Pingyang and is the main drainage channel for more than 100,000 mu of farmland in the area. Due to silt accumulation and the disrepair of the original sluice gates, the storage and drainage have become ineffective, affecting agricultural production. In 1942, the surveying team stationed in Zhejiang from the North China Water Conservancy Commission first carried out surveying. This year, the Water Conservancy Bureau reorganized and redesigned it based on its survey results. It is planned to rebuild three sluice gates first, which are estimated to cost 690 million yuan. A special project has been submitted to the central government for inclusion in the National Post-War Relief Fund for allocation of funds for construction. 100,000 mu of farmland will benefit after the project is completed.

(C) Pingyang Beigang District Drainage Project: It is planned to dredge the channels and use water pumps. The Water Conservancy Bureau has completed the survey and design. The estimated cost is 620 million yuan. It has been submitted to the central government for allocation of funds together with the Nangang District project. 20,000 mu of farmland will benefit after the project is completed.

(D) Qu County Shishi Weir Irrigation Project: The weir should be rebuilt with sluice gates and the channels should be rectified to facilitate irrigation and navigation. The Water Conservancy Bureau has sent personnel to complete the survey and design. The estimated cost is 500 million yuan. A special project has been submitted to the central government for inclusion in the Post-War Relief Fund for allocation of funds for handling. 110,000 mu of farmland can benefit after the project is completed.

(E) Construction of Sluice Gates in the Yongrui Coastal Area: The Yongjia and Ruian counties' coastal and river areas' sluice gates were first started in January 1944 at Dongshan, Shangping, Huqiao, and Maozhu, but were suspended due to enemy troop movements. Construction resumed in July 1945, but was suspended again due to lack of funds. This year, the Water Conservancy Bureau selected Guanghua, Neiwai, Yunting, Dongmen, and Huqiao, and the estimated cost is 407.6 million yuan. The wages portion has been agreed to allocate 325,500 pounds of flour from the Zhejiang-Fujian Branch to provide work relief. The Eighth Special District Office has been ordered to resume construction. Approximately 100,000 mu of farmland will benefit from the project.

(F) Qu County Wuping Weir Irrigation Project: Because the original water inlet of the weir is easily silted up, a new inlet must be opened, a sluice gate built, the main branch channel rectified, and north-south branching gates built. Construction started in 1942, and most of the 12-kilometer-long channel earthwork has been completed, but it was suspended due to enemy movements. This year, the bureau redesigned it according to the original plan, requiring 143.909675 million yuan. The wages portion has been agreed to allocate 190,890 pounds of flour from the Zhejiang-Fujian Branch to provide work relief. The county has been ordered to organize a construction organization to resume work as soon as possible. Once the project is completed, 60,000 mu of farmland will benefit.

(G) Jinhua Hu Haitang Irrigation Project: If the pond is dredged and the ditches are excavated, 12,000 mu of farmland can be irrigated, and the water level difference can be used to build a hydropower plant to generate 474 horsepower to supply electricity for lighting and industrial power. A preliminary survey has been completed, and the estimated cost is 420 million yuan. Detailed surveying and design are currently being prepared.

(H) Yueqing Wanqiao Port Gate Construction Project: The project was first partially completed by the county in 1938. This year, the bureau plans to continue construction, with an estimated cost of 557.6 million yuan. 160,000 mu of farmland will benefit, and an application for work relief has been submitted to the Zhejiang-Fujian Branch.

(I) Huangyan Yongning River Irrigation Project: The project has long been surveyed and designed, with an estimated cost of 1 billion yuan. 200,000 mu of farmland will benefit. The plan has been issued to the county for preparation, and a request for funds has been submitted to the central government, and a request for materials and equipment has been submitted to the Zhejiang-Fujian Branch.

(J) Dongqian Lake Irrigation Project: The plan has been roughly approved, and it is planned to dredge, build dikes, and repair gates to facilitate irrigation. The reorganization committee is planning to handle it.

Small Agricultural Irrigation Projects

This province carries out small agricultural irrigation projects. The focus of the plains areas is on irrigation, drainage, and the restoration of polders. The mountainous counties mainly focus on digging ponds to store water and repairing gates and dams. However, the projects are fragmented and the area is vast. The province has traditionally adopted a province-directed, county-managed approach to ensure universality. This year, this method will continue to be promoted. The bureau will assign technicians to patrol the area and provide guidance, and the provincial government will issue an order to all counties to survey and estimate all projects to be carried out this year before the end of September, and prepare implementation plans by November 1. All counties will start construction at the same time, using national compulsory labor to carry them out universally. The necessary expenses are estimated at 5 million able-bodied men in the province, each working for ten days in accordance with the Compulsory Labor Law, for a total of 50 million workdays. At one cubic meter per workday, 50 million cubic meters of earthwork can be done. In addition to collecting project beneficiary fees or borrowing accumulated grain, the province will also negotiate with the China Farmers Bank to handle small agricultural loans. In the first half of this year, the head office of China Farmers Bank approved a loan amount of 11.5 million yuan, which was distributed to the first, third, and fifth districts at 1.4 million yuan each, the second and eleventh districts at 1.2 million yuan each, and the fourth district at 1.6 million yuan. The remaining 3.3 million yuan will be distributed to other districts as needed. In July, the head office of China Farmers Bank approved a loan of 100 million yuan, and distributed it to the first, second, and eleventh districts at 12 million yuan each, the third, fourth, fifth, and tenth districts at 10 million yuan each, and the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth districts at 6 million yuan each. It is now planned to continue to borrow 400 million yuan from China Farmers Bank to assist, and is currently in negotiations. In addition, in accordance with the small work relief measures announced by the Zhejiang-Fujian Branch, applications can be made to allocate materials and carry out work relief. The projects that have been applied for include the Lishui Haoxi Weir, the Yiyao Andong Dike Construction, the Shangchu Canal Improvement, and the excavation of ponds, the Qingyuan Wu Ba Du, the Jinyun Mingshan Fan, the Songyang Suburbs, the Yongkang Suburbs, and other water conservancy projects, as well as the Wukang Xiaoxi Town Restoration, the Zhenhai River Dredging, the Wenling Kaixi Musha River, the Deqing Dike Construction and River Dredging, the Wuxing River Dredging, the Zhuji Jiuli Reservoir Construction, the Pingyang Wanjin District River Dredging, the Jiangshan Dike and Dam Construction, the Haiyan South Lake Dredging, and the Shouchang Lvhe Pond Restoration.

Hydropower Projects

The rivers in this province originate in mountainous areas, with steep slopes and rapid flows, and rich water resources. If they are used to build hydropower plants, it will be helpful for industrial construction. Those that have been successfully built in the past include the Yunhe Suburbs Hydropower Plant. The ones that have been built and completed this year include the Suichang Longtan and the Longquan Suburbs. The ones that are being planned include Fenghua Xikou, Longyou Lingshan Town, Qu County Shishi Weir, Qingyuan Wu Ba Du, Jinyun Mingshan Fan, Quanhua Hu Haitang, Wukang Sibu Hall, Pingyang Nanyandang, and Yiwu Futang. The Water Conservancy Bureau also plans to build a large-scale hydropower plant at Qililong in the upper reaches of the Qiantang River. If it can be realized, it can supply electricity for city lights and industry in the counties along the Qiantang River, which will be very effective. As for the Ou River, the Nantian Baizhang Waterfall in Qingtian can also be used for power generation, but the costs of these two projects are huge, so they will be planned first, and will be developed in the future. The Resources Committee has been asked to send personnel to assist in the implementation.

Achievements in Water Conservancy over the Years

The water conservancy cause in Zhejiang Province had a good scale before the war during the time of Director Zhang of the Water Conservancy Bureau. During the war, while Chairman Huang Wu was in the front lines, he still actively promoted economic construction, and the agricultural irrigation and hydropower projects received loans and technical assistance from China Farmers Bank, which achieved considerable results. The hydraulic engine created by the Zhejiang Iron Works was particularly excellent. Chairman Shen and Director Pi of the Water Conservancy Department also paid special attention to water conservancy. This city’s winter supervision and direction of the large-scale mobilization of civil labor in various districts and counties to carry out water conservancy and transportation is still a decisive policy. The establishment of the Qiantang River Seawall Project Bureau was able to focus on the dedicated work of the engineers. The restoration of the stone embankment work, the enthusiastic support of Director Sun Zhu of the Zhejiang-Fujian Branch of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and expert Marshall Moore-Gage of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, approved the allocation of 13,000 tons of flour to carry out work relief. Sun Choupei, the technical specialist and director of China Farmers Bank, and the supervisors of the China Farmers Bank Quadruple General Office, were concerned about the water conservancy of this province, and the amount of loans was gradually increased, which was also a timely help to promote the work. As for the administrative supervision area's establishment of the river basin water conservancy advisory committee according to orders, such as Chen Qinshi, Jiang Mingsan, Zhu Mingtao, Qu Wenliu, Zhang Qiang, and Lu Gongwang, all were extraordinarily enthusiastic about the local water conservancy cause and provided leadership in many ways, according to the original plan, weighing priorities, distinguishing urgency, and repairing in order. I have now accompanied Director Pi to Beijing to present the complete project plan to Minister Xue of the Agricultural and Forestry Department and Director Xue of the Water Conservancy Commission of the Executive Yuan, and Director Xue has agreed to allocate large sums, which can be combined with the relief goods of the Relief Administration to seize the time and promote the work. It is hoped that all advanced personnel in the engineering world and local talents will assist at any time, then the entire project will not be difficult to implement gradually.

### A Compass for Single Women

— Translated by Yabo from Magazine Digest

This article is written for one in four American women who, whether they want to or not, will never find a husband. Roughly four million American women, between the ages of twenty and thirty-five, will never marry.

But first, women should understand how this problem arose.

Firstly, the mortality rate for men has always been higher than for women. Even before the war, according to statistics collected by the New York Daily News, there were already 730,129 more women than men in the United States.

In World War II, 380,000 American men died, and at least 400,000 more veterans returned with mental or physical injuries that made them unable to marry.

Furthermore, one in ten men is stubbornly committed to bachelorhood, and this proportion is likely even higher among veterans. Another factor is that many soldiers returned to find their girlfriends several years older; as a result, they abandoned them and married their eighteen-year-old sisters. The original girlfriends were thus left without husbands.

Where Should She Live?

Where is it appropriate for a lifelong single woman to live?

Many women continue to live with their parents until old age. Some continue to manage the household after one of their parents passes away, especially when there are younger siblings in the family.

Some parents often rely on the meager salaries earned by a single daughter to support the family, while her married brothers or sisters, despite having better incomes, provide no assistance at all. In such cases, if the married sister living with them needs to go out, she expects the single sister to take care of the children.

Ms. Ruth Reed tells us about a clever single woman who created a budget for family expenses, asking her married brothers and sisters living with her to share a portion of the household costs, which she collected monthly. This way, she maintained a very harmonious relationship with her entire family.

If a single woman lives in a public dormitory, she will encounter many difficult problems: a lack of privacy and quiet, interference from the landlord, a lack of security, and no private property...

Most authorities agree that a single woman should have her own personal home, even if it's just a one-room apartment. A former headmistress of a girls' school for many years said, "When I had my own apartment, the greatest joy was knowing that I could get complete rest at night because no students would disturb me."

Some women express happiness because they have their own furniture. Even if it's just a few pieces of furniture moved from her parents' house, it can evoke all sorts of emotions from the past. Still other women who previously disliked managing household affairs now find interest in making beds and cooking meals, because it prevents them from being bored all day long.

However, many women living alone do not pay attention to preparing their meals properly. Why is the mortality rate for single women over sixty higher than for married women of the same age? This is one of the reasons.

Some single women have partially solved this problem—several of them live together. If they get along well, organizing a joint household is a very ideal method, as they can share expenses and become good companions.

What About Romantic Emotions?

Romantic love is generally recognized as a normal part of the marriage process. Statistics tell us that a single woman over the age of thirty has very little chance of getting married. Albert Bennett said in his book "The Foundations of Feminism": "Know that marriage is a full-time business. It offers people an opportunity to obtain happiness, but it does not guarantee that happiness; divorces in court can prove this point."

However, unmarried women face a complex emotional problem in their personal lives. Reverend Herbert A. Gray said in his book "Men, Women, and God": "Her fate contains hidden pressures, unfulfilled desires, and occasional depression. Around the ages of twenty-five to thirty, this depression becomes exceptionally acute."

Dr. Gray advocates that single women must embrace a philosophy of self-reliance and be determined to become useful members of society. Let her understand that most of the practically valuable work—the work that has shaped today's culture, such as educating children, caring for the sick, and helping the poor—can be done by single women. Therefore, it should be recognized that single women are extremely needed members of society.

Furthermore, almost every man has been directly or indirectly blessed by a single woman; an elderly aunt or sister initially helped him to gain a foothold in society. This is a very common occurrence.

If you do not want to rely on your relatives or charitable organizations to help you in your old age, then you should set aside a portion of your earnings each month as savings while you are still earning money.

Take the Helm of Your Life

A woman needs to love others and to be loved by others; however, this does not necessarily mean romantic love. It means service to others. Dr. Gray said: "The best way to receive love is to extend love to others." When people feel the pain of loneliness, it is mainly the loneliness of the heart. But the most useless thing is for a person to sit idly by, feeling depressed and waiting for someone to love her. That is truly a desperate path.

One single woman solved her troubles by using her free time to work in a nursery school. Another self-pitying woman found happiness by wholeheartedly immersing herself in social service. Still another shy and timid woman found satisfaction by successfully leading a study group in a church.

A Ms. JM learned excellent cooking skills, and her "apartment" dinners have become a highly engaging activity in her circle of friends.

A Ms. MacD developed a passion for photography, thus finding a solution to her loneliness. Initially, an elderly relative gave her a camera, so she joined a photography study group. Now she has opened her own photography studio, thus earning double the income. This business is not only extremely interesting to her, but also allows her to connect with many like-minded friends.

For Ms. K, her solution is travel. Every summer, she travels to various different places, scenic spots, and historical sites, and makes at least one new friend on each trip.

Finally, there remains the question of sexual urges. According to doctors, a normal sexual relationship should be part of everyone's life. However, many people live without this kind of life and are still able to adapt to this environment happily.

As Freud pointed out, the danger of complete abstinence—suppressing normal desires altogether—can produce a functional neurosis. This is something that many single women naturally encounter.

The antidote to functional neurosis is to redirect sexual urges to other avenues, such as work, research, or hobbies. Freud said: "There is no shortage of young scientists who are celibate; these celibate scientists are able to devote more energy to their scientific endeavors."

Single women naturally have many problems, but their problems may not be as numerous as those of their married sisters. The happiness of single women depends entirely on their ability to steer their own course in a beneficial direction, to find their own path in life, and to devote themselves to work, hobbies, and the position their family should occupy. Most importantly, it is that she has her own place among other people. (Translated from the November 1946 issue of "Magazine Digest.")

### Did the Turkeys Run Away, Are the Children Raising Chickens Thinking About Christmas?

### Milk Talk

— Anonymous

Now that winter is here, people are using milk as a nourishing drink. Here are a few pieces of knowledge about milk, published below, for the reference of housewives.

Milk contains calcium and phosphorus, a lot of vitamins A and C, and a considerable amount of vitamins B and E.

If milk is heated to 63 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes, the pathogens will be completely eliminated, and the composition of the milk will remain completely unchanged, identical to raw milk. If you let it boil, all the important nutrients in it, such as vitamins, will lose a large part, so its effectiveness will also be weakened.

Milk coagulates into lumps in the stomach. Swallowing it in large gulps will cause it to coagulate into a large mass, while taking it in small sips will form small lumps, so it is advisable to drink milk slowly. Because small lumps are easier to digest than large masses.

Milk and vinegar should not be eaten together, otherwise, the abdomen often has bursts of cramping pain, which is very uncomfortable.

Even sterilized milk can spoil if left for a long time. A simple way to test milk is to invert the milk bottle. If white solids rise, it is evidence of spoilage.

Milk production varies greatly depending on the breed of cow. The most productive breed is Holstein; it produces an average of 15 liters of milk per day, with approximately 300 milking days per year.

According to recent statistics, the average annual per capita consumption of milk is approximately 53 liters for the British and 116 liters for the Americans. Swiss consumption is also quite substantial. There are no statistics for China.

The only food that is universally popular in the world is milk. In Roman times, the Greeks considered milk to be food for children and uncivilized countries.

### The Importance of Maternal Love

— Yingwu

Maternal education is the fundamental education of life. The greatness of its power is sufficient to complete an individual's personality, promote social progress, strengthen national development, and enhance human happiness. In our country's society, ethical thought and family concepts are particularly strong. Parents are both the head of the family, but the father is often unable to balance work and family due to various constraints. Therefore, the mother actually becomes the closest person to the children in the family, and the mother's words and actions have the deepest impact on the children. Therefore, the importance of maternal education is indeed undeniable.

Regarding the origin of the term "maternal education," it is said to have originated from the Yilin written by Jiao Yanshou of the Han Dynasty. The Yilin says: "Losing hold of maternal education, a good match elopes." This is the beginning of the term "maternal education." However, the fact of maternal education has existed since ancient times. In Chinese history, there are countless examples of excellent mothers, such as Mencius's mother moving three times to choose a neighborhood and cutting the loom to teach her son; Tao's mother cutting her hair to entertain guests and reprimanding her son for accepting salted fish; Ou's mother teaching her son with reeds and Liu's mother teaching her son with pills, and the mothers of Uncle Ao teaching their sons with wisdom, and Wangsun teaching their sons with loyalty, all of which shine in history and set a maternal model for thousands of years.

Why is the power of maternal education so great? Because children have the closest relationship with their mothers after they are born. A mother's breastfeeding and cuddling both affect the child, and this influence is an educational effect. And the education received in infancy often affects a lifetime. Therefore, Chinese and foreign educators all emphasize education in infancy when discussing children's education. The proverb says, "Teach the wife when she first arrives, teach the child in infancy," which means to emphasize infant education. Child psychologist Freud said: "The basic habits of mankind are mostly established in childhood." Mental hygiene expert Dr. Knight said: "Childhood is the golden age for implementing mental hygiene." From these points, we can see the importance of education in infancy. Because children are most susceptible to external stimuli. A newborn baby is like a blank sheet of paper. The first color that is applied leaves the deepest mark and is never easy to remove. For example, if a newborn baby cries, and you hug or rock him, it won't take a week before he will desperately want you to hug and rock him. Therefore, good and bad habits are formed from a young age. Especially habits formed in childhood, and will affect a lifetime. The great British naturalist Darwin's family produced outstanding scholars for generations, especially his mother, who was a famous virtuous mother, so someone came to her to ask her at what age the education of children should begin, and she asked: "How old is your child now?" The man replied, "Just one and a half years old." Darwin's mother then replied: "The opportunity to educate your child has already been delayed by one and a half years."

Therefore, the education of children should start from the time they are born, and it must be taught well from the beginning. If it is not taught well from the beginning, it will be difficult to teach well later. In the past, a qin teacher issued an enrollment advertisement, which said: "The tuition for those who have not learned the qin is one yuan, and the tuition for those who have already learned it is two yuan." This means that not teaching well from the beginning is not only useless, but also harmful. Therefore, we can say that the day a child is born is the time he begins to be educated. His future achievements depend on the basic education he receives. Because the mother has a close relationship with the child, especially infants during the breastfeeding period, they cannot be separated from the mother at any time, so the mother is indeed the child's first teacher. Even for older children, because they have the most contact with their mother in their living environment, they are most influenced by their mother. Therefore, the importance of maternal education cannot be denied by anyone.

Spring and Autumn

### Lonely Monologue

— Bailiu

One

I fear the long winter nights.

Because, in sleepless nights, I feel even colder and lonelier, even when wrapped in a warm quilt, and even when accompanied by the snores of others.

Therefore, in sleepless nights, I always hope to see the lights of night travelers flickering through the window, and I also hope to hear the footsteps of night travelers—even if it is the visit of a thief.

Two

The person who once punched me on the bridge of my nose, ten years later today, is the new appointee who has come to take over my position with a smile.

...

I hate a detestable face, a face I encountered on the bus some time ago. I had thought to myself, I would never encounter a second detestable face like this in my life. But, heavens, who would have thought that this face would actually be seen a second time, and still on the bus?

...

Is the world too big? The world is too small!

Three

I fear entering any gathering place.

Shaking hands with this person, and then shaking hands with that person—shaking back and forth, but never touching a truly warm hand.

I don't want to speak insincerely, but I can't bear to listen to other people's "high-minded arguments," because I always feel that the voice is not coming from the speaker's heart.

"Not a single decent person, not a single decent word." I like these two lines from your play, Cao Yu, you scoundrel.

I don't admit that this mood of mine is a sign of fading youth. On the contrary, I secretly rejoice, because the desire to seek "truth" and love "truth" is even stronger.

Four

I thank a gentleman for telling me the truth:

"I often see your name, but to be honest, I have never read a single word of your great works."

Isn't this how many people become famous?

I understand why "prolific writers" have to be so prolific.

I understand why some people use newspapers to publish their names several times.

I understand...

This world recognizes names, not the people those names represent.

Five

I was sitting in a speeding carriage.

Coming towards us, another speeding carriage. I watched it being hit by a truck. The poor skinny horse fell, and the coachman and passengers all fell into the street because the carriage shaft was broken.

The driver of the carriage I was in let out a joyful laugh.

This cannot be explained merely by "competitors are enemies." "Compassion" no longer has a place in people's hearts today. This driver is just one person.

That laughter sends shivers down my spine whenever I think of it.

No wonder I always think of loneliness in the midst of excitement.

Six

Yes, I always think of loneliness in the midst of excitement. This feeling is like—

The lingering smoke from a cigarette butt thrown into an ashtray after a night of dancing;

Like—

The lingering scent of wine after a feast has ended;

Like—

The sigh of a lonely night traveler in the dark night;

Like—

The staggering footsteps of a lover returning from the battlefield of love.

Seven

I once had the idea of converting to a religion, but this idea is still just an idea. It is now, and it will certainly be in the future. The reason is that I already have a piety towards life that is beyond that of a religious person. The wounds suffered from reality cannot be healed by the unrealistic language and fantasies of religion. Heaven? Can warmth be found in heaven?

Eight

Crying and laughing are two magic weapons that mankind uses to fill loneliness.

However, laughter does not fully possess this effect. Because laughter is not always filled with true emotion. Hypocrisy is the cause of loneliness, so hypocritical laughter naturally increases the loneliness in people's hearts.

Liar, don't grin and make an ugly laugh; if you want to cry, why don't you cry? Tears can wash away the dirt in your heart and fill the emptiness in other people's hearts. Why do you insist on suppressing crying with laughter?

### Ballad of Six States

— Gu Yiqiao

Napoleon's Tomb

Double-pupiled Xiang Yu, his achievements faded and fell. At the Wujiang crossing, singing rose, Chu songs sounded, sadly distraught. Recalling the events of that year, heaven doomed me, not the battle. Han Dan searched, the Hongmen Banquet, also glorious. His strength uprooted mountains, covering the world's heroic dreams, his豪氣 soared. Look at the elders who continue his martial exploits, all of Europe surrendered. Pipes and drums compete to sound, a continent is startled.

I ask, the Rhine River, Ah Peak Snow, after the turmoil, how many times have you looked back? At times, I suddenly feel that my heart is still strong, my aspirations are not yet fulfilled, so I embark on a Long March. At the edge of the Black Sea, the weather is bitterly cold, cautioning against endless war. The beacon fires are reduced, the burnt wilderness is everywhere, and hatred is difficult to quell. Pondering famous kings and ancient tombs?! You should see the 　produce.　Goods 　white 　bones, from having tears pouring down, after the劫離.

### Mrs. Ding

— Yun Xi

"Mr. Lin, come in and sit!" Mrs. Ding was standing at her gate again, calling out in a shrill voice.

It really was my bad luck; having walked past this grassy path beside the lotus pond three times, I was stopped by Mrs. Ding each time with a soul-calling shout. I hesitated, really torn: if I answered, it would be the same old platitudes, my ears were already calloused from them; if I turned and ran, wouldn't I look like a child afraid of a drowned ghost, and become a laughingstock?

Helpless, I hardened my scalp and strolled over as if nothing were happening.

"Come, come, Mr. Lin, come in and sit, come in and sit."

"No, I want to go home."

"It doesn't matter, Mr. Lin, it's a rare occasion!"

I chuckled inwardly, having come twice in half a month, and she still called it a rare occasion?

"No need, I'll come again next time."

"It doesn't matter, just sit for a little while, it doesn't matter, come in and sit, standing makes your feet ache!..." Her yellow and thin fingers tightly gripped my sleeve, and without allowing any argument, she pulled me inside.

The ancient hall, once again capturing me with its gray and dim wings; the musty smell made me nauseous...

After serving black tea, her first words were:

"Mr. Lin, do you know how Ah-xian is doing out there?"

I couldn't help but feel indignant. Yes, I knew Ding Jixian, with his aubergine face and blinking eyes every two seconds, now studying in Shanghai. But that was all; I had never been his follower, never been commissioned as an information gatherer, so to keep pestering me for details, like a shop assistant pestering for old debts, was simply absurd! However, in front of such an oddly kind, oddly solicitous woman, was there any room for you to bang the table, stomp your feet, and glare?

"Um, um," I said.

"Mr. Lin, I mean, how is our son doing in Shanghai?"

"Him, I'm not very clear, I know he's studying in some middle school."

"That's good then... Mr. Lin, I'm easily swayed by what I hear, Zhang Guicai, the small boss of the Jinfeng Silk Shop in town, do you know him, Mr. Lin?—He said that our Jixian is not well-behaved out there. I said, what is that supposed to mean? Our Ah-xian has always been well-behaved, what's not well-behaved?... But, although I said that, after he said that, I can't help but worry..."

The aunt's complaints, this time, were finally uprooted.

"Which mother isn't like this," I said.

"Yes, Mr. Lin, raising a child is not an easy task! Our Ah-xian is already the third one, the first two, his brothers A-long and A-yun, didn't grow up much before they went away alive... Speaking of our A-long, Mr. Lin, my tears have been flowing and haven't dried up yet! Just think, that killer—her husband—scared his little life away with his fierce appearance, isn't that a sin?... Mr. Lin, listen to me, that night, I had already put our A-long to bed, the killer came back drunk, aggressive, and insisted on the land deed again. You think, such little capital to live on, how could I give it to him casually, so I ignored him a thousand times... Who knew, he took a kitchen knife from the kitchen and swung it at my head, threatening to kill me. I thought, kill me, you don't have that much courage, so I wasn't afraid, and said: Okay, you dare, dare to kill me! Who knew, the kitchen knife really came down, I quickly turned my head, the knife hit the pillow, grazing my ear, and immediately there was a pool of blood. At that time, I didn't even know I was in pain, I was busy taking care of our A-long, who had already been awakened by the fright and was wailing. The killer vented his anger on his head, raised the knife, shouting that he would kill the little ghost, I hugged A-long, my whole body was shaking, A-long's two little shoulders were also shaking... " On her old face, wrinkled like dried dates, tears flowed freely. Trembling, she used a large and dirty handkerchief to wipe them away, and continued, choking:

"Just like that, our A-long got sick from fright, sought gods and medicine, but it couldn't be cured..."

I nodded, but wasn't saddened. – I'd heard this story from others, from the aunt herself, more than three times. But in any case, in this ancient hall, facing such a sad old woman, it was, after all, extremely embarrassing. – I got up to say goodbye.

"No, no, Mr. Lin, don't rush off, sit, sit a little longer..." She grabbed my sleeve again, "You, you have tea, look, you haven't drunk the tea yet. — Oh dear, the tea is cold, look at me... scatterbrained, I'll change it for you..."

She was busy changing my tea, urging me to drink, her emotions gradually calmed down, and after sitting down again, she began to vigorously rummage through the pocket inside her jacket, and after a long while, carefully took out a wrinkled envelope.

"Look, Mr. Lin, this is A-xian's recent letter, saying he needs to pay tuition again... This semester's tuition is really high, it comes to hundreds of thousands."

I opened the letter.

"Mother, I prostrate myself: Your son at school is being asked to pay a second installment of tuition fees amounting to 200,000, food expenses are 150,000, and your son also needs 200,000 for pocket money, totaling 550,000. It must be brought out by someone convenient at the end of this month, very important, very important!... "

I was surprised. Didn't the aunt clearly tell me that A-xian had already paid 200,000 in tuition, why is there a second installment? Obviously, this guy, relying on the old practices of the previous two semesters, has told a big lie?

"Mr. Lin, you say, how can tuition be so high! 200,000, and another 200,000, it wasn't this high before!... How can tuition be even higher after the war is going well?... " Her two confused eyes stared at me, as if helpless, and as if trying to find an explanation on my face.

"This semester's tuition is especially high compared to before, so the teachers' salaries are much better."

Saying this, I immediately felt ashamed in my heart.

"You only told half the truth! You shouldn't hide the truth about your son from your mother!" It seemed as if such a voice was resounding, warning me, gnawing at my conscience, causing pain.

"Tell her the whole story," I murmured to myself.

"But the aunt is stubborn, she only believes her own son, she doesn't believe Zhang Guicai's words, will she believe my words? Being too enthusiastic will only cause trouble, such a nagging and self-confident woman, can you disentangle yourself from her?... "

Conflicting thoughts rushed up, swallowing the words that were about to leave my lips. – A burst of enthusiasm suddenly cooled down.

My eyes swept over her old face, wrinkled like dried water chestnuts, and I really felt very sorry.

"The tuition is high, I won't mention it. I say our A-xian is really pitiful, living in Shanghai, and the family doesn't have much money, once the tuition is paid, there's not much left for pocket money, so he wrote to complain. People don't know, they think it's hundreds of thousands, but in reality, it's all for proper expenses, he hasn't spent it recklessly... Fortunately, in the summer vacation next year, he says he can graduate from middle school, and he'll finally have a chance to get ahead... "

"Woof woof... woof woof woof..." The sound of dogs barking chaotically at the door. The aunt hurriedly limped out to look, and then came back in.

"Wild dogs are so annoying, always fighting here—I thought there was a guest."

"Um, um—" I stood up to leave.

"Don't rush off, Mr. Lin," she ran close to me, her mouth almost touching my face, and asked softly:

"Mr. Lin, do you know if our A-xian has a sweetheart in Shanghai?... Why does he always say slowly when we try to find him a wife?... What is she like, a charmer? Mr. Lin, just tell me, I won't be angry..."

"This, I really don't know."

"Oh, oh, you don't know, I was just guessing, guessing... Mr. Lin, when you go to Shanghai, please inquire for me... Cough cough, you tell him, if he has someone he likes, discuss it with me too, don't always be at odds with your mother!...

"Yes, yes," I replied, stepping out the door.

"Mr. Lin, when are you going to Shanghai? When you're about to go, stop by here, I have something to ask you..." The aunt's dry and hoarse voice rang behind me.

As I walked, a blurry scene appeared before my eyes. I seemed to see the aunt limping, climbing a mountain path, she bravely climbed the mountain of "husband"; in a flash, she lost her footing and fell. – How heavy, how deep the fall! Then she licked her wounds, mustered her courage, and climbed towards another mountain. The words "son" were engraved on this mountain. Panting, stumbling, stepping on jagged rocks and thorny bushes, she climbed up, confident in her heart, she saw a glimmering light, reflected in her blurred old eyes... She was sure that soon, this blurred light would shine in her eyes, and she would be able to grasp it firmly...

However, that mountain had begun to shake and was about to collapse...

You can naturally guess the outcome...

### Boat Women – Continued Yangzhou Dreams, Part 7

— Hong Wei Fa

As far as this writer's memory goes, the pleasure boats on the Slender West Lake seem to have become smaller and smaller with the evolution of the times. In the past, large painted boats were large enough to hold banquets. Not counting the boatmen, servants, and cooks, there were even powdered and rouged women to pour wine and play music. Such painted boats naturally had to be very large, with railings on both sides and a flying canopy above. Inside, there were also many furnishings. Such painted boats can no longer be seen today. The ones that can be seen now are much smaller, and the arrangements, etc., are far inferior to what they used to be. Even these relatively small painted boats seem to have lost their youth, revealing a state of decline, and are no longer favored by tourists. A scattered few are quietly waiting for families of all ages to patronize them.

In recent years, the boats on the lake that come and go are mostly of a very small type, commonly known as small rowboats. These small rowboats have clean white cloth canopies, supported by iron bars on all sides. The canopy holds a few rattan deck chairs, and there is also a small wooden table for placing tea sets. It is very comfortable for three or four people to sit in one boat. The boat is small, fast, and maneuverable when cruising the lake, so it is naturally loved by most people.

However, the large painted boats have been eliminated with the evolution of the times, and the small rowboats have emerged in response to the times. This is certainly the most significant change on the Slender West Lake in recent years, but in this writer's observation, there is another feeling of vicissitude that arises between the pre-war and post-war periods, which is that some of the boat women who pole the small rowboats have also changed. The boat women before the war seemed to have certain requirements in terms of clothing. They were mostly black silk trousers and white cloth shirts. Such attire, set against the deep green vegetation, was like a carefree seagull that was not easily seen on the lake, and was naturally very pleasing to the eye. Furthermore, many were in their prime, with quite a few having delicate features. Under the condition of "knowing good looks, then admiring young women," their life of poling boats on the lake would undoubtedly be more prosperous than that of the other vulgar boatmen. In addition, their boat-poling skills were also very good. Holding a bamboo pole, they poled very nimbly. No matter how far they went, with each up and down movement of the pole, their clothes would not be splashed with a single drop of water. That kind of nimble body and skilled technique, like music having rhythm, if you lay in a rattan chair and watched with a discerning eye, you could not help but secretly admire it.

Young people are always active and competitive. Seeing the boat women's skill in poling boats, they would happily learn, asking the boat women to sit in the boat while they poled. The boat women, watching them sometimes struggle with the pole, causing the small rowboat to spin around on the lake, or pole awkwardly, splashing water all over their bodies when they pulled up the pole, would giggle in a group. In the willow shade on this side, beside the reeds on that side, the laughter rising and falling was often strung together in a series, and then slowly subsided, finally sinking into the lake breeze. This was truly a wonderful embellishment on the lake. Unfortunately, boat women with delicate features are now rarely seen, and their clothing is not as neat as it used to be. Even their boat-poling skills do not seem as skilled as they used to be. This is a disaster brought about by the war. Decaying Yangzhou can no longer withstand such a disaster!

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of Blood – 124

— Ye Jingfeng

Pingzi sobbed for a while, then, turning her back to Tsurumi, took out a handkerchief to dry her tears. Suddenly, she turned around again, looked up at Tsurumi with her face raised, and forced a smile:

"Brother, I'm terribly sorry. Someone as moody as me must be repulsive to you... But I don't know why I suddenly felt so sad." Pingzi said, seeing the look of panic on Tsurumi's face, and couldn't help but feel a little lost. Although she smiled weakly, two large tears welled up in the corners of her eyes, shining brightly in the moonlight. "Brother, your willpower is stronger than my concentration; I don't have the ability to explore your heart." She admitted defeat.

"Pingzi, please don't blame me for being rude, but what exactly did you write on that little piece of paper?" Tsurumi wanted to find out how loyal this woman was to him. "That piece of paper has already been taken by that old man Konoe."

Pingzi seemed a little shy upon hearing this, and after a long pause, seeing that Tsurumi was still waiting for her reply, she lowered her head. "That was my own private matter, so I didn't want anyone to see it... It was a little poem that I like to read the most, I changed a few words in the first two lines—fourteen words in total, it was..."

Tsurumi really didn't want her to say those fourteen words, but she still recited those two lines with a shy smile on her face, and recited them twice. There was no need to doubt Pingzi's loyalty. However, at this moment, two conflicting thoughts arose in Tsurumi's mind—for the sake of the motherland, he could use any means necessary, even if it meant feigning love to drive this woman to cooperate with him, it wouldn't be considered immoral; for the sake of the motherland, everything should be sacrificed. But on the other hand, the method of using any means necessary should also have a limit, and the boundary of this limit should probably be the realm of personality. As a dignified man, even if he used any means necessary, he shouldn't violate the realm of personality.

He pondered for a while and decided to use Pingzi to cooperate, but not to deceive her, in order to maintain the dignity of his personality.

"Pingzi, there's something I have to say now: Can we draw a clearer line between public and private? In other words, we don't talk about love in official matters; in private matters, we don't involve official duties?"

Upon hearing this sudden proposal, Pingzi first seemed to fall into a wave of panic, as if she didn't understand Tsurumi's intention. Then she felt that Tsurumi was testing her, to see if her love was firm and eternal. But digging deeper, she felt that Tsurumi was challenging her, because while she didn't deeply understand Tsurumi's political position, Tsurumi didn't seem to understand what banner she was carrying. She stared blankly at Tsurumi, lost in thought for quite a while:

"Please explain it a little more clearly, so that I can understand it thoroughly."

"It's very obvious, I'm not worth grabbing your weakness, to fool you, to use you!" Although Tsurumi's voice was very light and thin, very low, but in Pingzi's eardrum, it was as hard and fierce as thunder, "I remember you said that your father and the others think I'm going down the wrong path; you also said that you wouldn't explain. Now I really want to know their true position. That's one point. The second point is, I also want to know Elder Qingmu's opinion on the current situation. The third point is, I'm even more willing to understand your personal opinion—regarding the current situation!... But I'm ashamed to say that, until a sufficiently mature stage, I can't explain my true purpose to you. Before I can explain it, I don't want to fool you, I want to maintain my personality!"

### Exploration

— Shao Fu

Reading the United Press report on the US Navy's Antarctic expedition may give us a certain feeling: the value of human life, some is brilliant and splendid, some is ordinary and colorless, what a huge disparity that is!

Life represents hope, with life, hope is endless, but this principle applies to everyone, it's just that the so-called value of hope must be assessed differently.

A telegram sent from the small warship Olympus on its way to Little America stated:

The USS Sennet, a submarine belonging to the US Navy Antarctic Expedition, will submerge under the ice upon reaching Antarctica, fire on the ice layer of the Ross Sea, and launch two torpedoes to see what happens. According to submarine captain Eisenhower: the ice block will not suffer any damage. The submarine has ten officers and seventy crew members, all of whom volunteered to participate in this expedition. The length of the underwater voyage, the cold climate, and the dangerous winds and waves will be the most experienced by the submarine USS Sennet.

These people are not fools, so why are they willing to take such risks, are they really tired of living? These people are not fools, on the contrary, they are the smartest people in the world. They spare no personal life as capital for the lives of the majority. How can human civilization and progress lack such fools?

Secondly, we think of the US Navy, which during this World War, in the Atlantic, the Mediterranean, and especially the Pacific, demonstrated its combat power, but once the war ended, they engaged in such scientific work, doing their best for the academic community. This phenomenon has allowed us to realize the inseparability of the forces of war and peace, breaking the narrow-minded concept of pure military affairs; at the same time, it also demonstrates that based on the standpoint of national defense, military equipment can also engage in various other activities, contributing to the country, the nation, and even the world.

Finding difficulties, overcoming difficulties, for safety, happiness, human activities are endless, but for oneself or one's own small circle, it is fundamentally worthless.

### Miscellaneous Jokes

— Ge Chunliang

Translated from the December "Reader's Digest"

A Beggar's Humor

A ragged tramp in New York stopped a well-dressed man and said, "Sir, could you give me a dime? I'm so hungry I'm about to die." After the man gave him a dime, he couldn't help but say, "I'm afraid a dime won't buy any food in this day and age."

"That's not what I'm begging for to buy food," said the tramp, "I haven't eaten anything for eight days. I want to use this dime to weigh myself on a scale and see."

The Start of a War

"Dad," asked a ten-year-old boy, "how does a war start?"

"Ah, son," said Dad, "let me tell you, for example, suppose the United States and Britain were arguing—"

"The United States isn't arguing with Britain," Mom interrupted Dad, saying.

"Who said they were arguing?" Dad said, obviously angry: "I'm just using a hypothetical analogy to give the boy an example."

"That's absurd," Mom roared: "You're always instilling all sorts of wrong ideas into his head."

"What's absurd about it?" Dad said aggressively, "If he listens to you, he'll never have any ideas in his head."

The argument grew more and more heated. Just as it was becoming inextricable, the son spoke up. "Mom, thank you, Dad, thank you. Now I completely understand how wars start!"

The Pen's Cry

The landlord sternly said to the tenant who was about to move in: "I must inform you once again. I don't want to hear the sounds of children, dogs, cats, parrots, or any animals in your room. No piano playing, no radio listening. Understand?"

"Yes," said the tenant timidly, "but, you should know, my pen sometimes often makes a hissing sound!"

Cross-section of Shanghai

### The Organization of Beggars 17

— Huang Jiamo

The Northern Faction of Beggars in Shanghai

In Shanghai, besides the local beggar gangs, there are several types of beggar organizations. Among them, the "Hard Coercion Gang" is the most tightly organized and has the most ancient history, absolutely not comparable to the local beggar gangs that have sprung up halfway. The "Hard Coercion Gang" of beggars has a long history and belongs to a nationwide orthodox beggar organization. During the Qing Dynasty, the gang was thriving, with beggars spreading throughout the north and south of the country, even to remote areas. Because throughout the Qing Dynasty, the imperial court had issued "Imperial Edicts," bestowing beggar leaders with special permission to "beg at every door" and "set up factories in every city" and "establish units in every town," its influence was extraordinary. The "beggar factories," or commonly known as "beggar camps," that we are familiar with in various places belong to the "Hard Coercion Gang."

Shanghai is a major city that has risen to prominence in the last century and is located in the affluent southeastern region, so naturally, the "Hard Coercion Gang" would not ignore this lucrative opportunity. Beggar factories were established in Shanghai as early as the mid-Qing Dynasty. Although the details are unknown to the author, we only need to pay a little attention to see traces of the "Hard Coercion Gang" beggars still everywhere in this city, and we can imagine that their power is still not to be trifled with.

The "Hard Coercion Gang" spread from the north to the Jiangnan region. Just by listening to their language, one can tell that they have accents from north of the Yellow River. It is clear that there are no Jiangnan people mixed in this gang. The beggar leader is also called "Unit Head," and each beggar factory has only one. In the past, he had absolute authority over all beggars in Shanghai. According to the tradition of the beggar gang, the beggar leader had the power of "life and death." The gang's hierarchy was very strict, and its rules were extremely fair. In the former Qing Dynasty, any beggar who had not been "trained" could not beg in this city. Even beggars from other places had to go to pay respects to the beggar leader, known as "visiting the pier," before they could engage in begging in this city; otherwise, even finding a place to stay would be a problem. Even if they had savings and did not want to beg in this city, they still had to "visit the pier." This is a strict general rule in the world of beggars, respecting elders and honoring the old.

It is not difficult for readers to know which beggars belong to the "Hard Coercion Gang." Just look at the following categories, and you can find evidence from your memory. The meaning of the name "Hard Coercion" is "forceful begging." If you give him money, he will leave without thanking you. If you don't give him money, he will never leave empty-handed. He will either resist for a long time, show off his skills, or sing beggar songs. If you still don't give, he will cause a bloody incident at your door, called "hanging colors." However, he would never dare to cut your flesh but would cut his own flesh, spilling his own blood, making a bloody mess to escalate the situation. At this point, you have no choice but to give him money to get rid of them, but even then, they still refuse to leave, demanding at least ten times more money before they will go. These are the "evil beggars" we have always despised. They all have one or two special performance skills, described as follows:

(1) "Nose Tip Balancing"—Placing a short bamboo stick on the tip of the nose, with bowls and plates on the upper end, able to hold it for a long time without falling.

(2) "Lotus Drop"—Tapping bamboo clappers while singing a ditty; the rhythm is harmonious, and the song is long without repeating.

(3) "Azure Dragon"—Carrying a bamboo basket on the back, containing several green snakes. Always holding a snake in hand and playing with it.

(4) "Double Piercing"—Using an iron hook to pierce a hole in the side of the nose and another in the throat.

(5) "Brick Beating Street"—Hitting the chest with a brick, calling out along the street, using the beating of the chest as a rhythm, corresponding with the cries.

(6) "Phoenix Display"—Inserting a thin needle into the forehead, with the end of the needle supporting a bowl, singing songs while walking in a line.

After their performance, if they do not get money, they take out a bamboo flute from their colored bag and play it mournfully as a final warning. If they still do not get money, they take out a small sharp knife and cut their forehead, causing blood to flow down their face. They always beg in small groups of two or three people for mutual support.

### Social Luminary Chu Fucheng

— Fengbo

During the War of Resistance, anyone who lived in Chongqing would know how formidable Mr. Chu was in the National Political Council. He criticized people as much as, or even more than, Huang Yanpei and Kong Geng. Before the victory, he, along with Zuo Shunsheng, Mo Dehui, and others, flew to Yan'an to mediate the disputes between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Although the mediation has not been successful to this day, as long as the door to peace is not closed, there is still a glimmer of hope.

Around the time of the Northern Expedition, he devoted himself to the revolution, contributing greatly. He is a prominent meritorious official in the history of the party and the nation. Mr. Chu is also happy to run education. In 1926, he co-founded the Law College with Yu Youren, Wang Chonghui, and others. During the eight-year War of Resistance, Mr. Chu also ran a branch of the Shanghai Law College in Wanxian, Sichuan. After the victory, it was officially renamed Fucheng College in his honor.

Mr. Chu is still serving as the president of the Shanghai Law College.

Mr. Chu Fucheng, also known as Huiyi, is from Jiaxing, Zhejiang. He is frugal and lives a simple life. He always wears a blue cloth gown and cloth shoes. On rainy days, he wears rubber shoes at most. He is short in stature and walks with a slight sway. His face is thin and wears glasses. Wrinkles on his forehead further highlight his demeanor as a scholar who has experienced hardship.

This time, at the National Assembly, he advocated for postponement, hoping that the peace talks between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party would succeed, and they could jointly discuss national affairs. Therefore, he was late this time and only took the oath before the fifth meeting on the 30th of last month. As a representative of social luminaries, he attended the National Assembly and will surely make many contributions in the future.

### "Peeling the Old Man"

— Yu Feng

Yesterday evening, around nine o'clock, I was held up by a friend for dinner. After chatting for a while, I was eager to go home, so I took a shortcut. As I turned into Yinghua Street, most of the shops along the way had already closed, and there were few pedestrians. I saw a rogue-like person on the opposite sidewalk, staring intently at an old man in his fifties or sixties, speaking in a strange tone. I assumed that he was probably soliciting him to see "erotic pictures" or "mirror grinding" and other obscene things. At first, he followed for a while and nothing happened. The old man walked faster and faster, trying to avoid the man's harassment, but the rogue, seeing no response, pursued him even more closely, constantly muttering those vulgar words. It seemed that the old man couldn't bear it anymore. He turned around, glared at the rogue, pointed his trembling finger, and cursed:

"You should look at people... Why are you staring at me? You scoundrel!"

The rogue was a little unconvinced and started to curse back with dirty words, almost getting physical. At this moment, three decently dressed men came out from the side, trying to persuade them. They pushed and shoved, and without the old man's consent, pushed him into a dark alley next to the Jingmei Restaurant! I couldn't help but feel strange. So I slowed down and watched the opposite side from afar, but I couldn't see anything clearly under the dim street light. Although I was very suspicious of the development of this strange drama.

I crossed to the other side, and then I heard a few people talking loudly as they walked by; listening carefully, it was about the aftermath of that strange drama. One of them said:

"These scoundrels are getting more and more lawless. It seems that the old man has suffered again."

"I don't think the old man's injuries are light! I don't know how they managed to get him into this alley... Alas! They beat him up and stripped him of his coat and all his clothes!" Another seemed a little sad.

"We should be careful on this road in the future!..."

After that, I sped up my pace because there was no need to listen anymore.

I feel that the methods of these criminals are getting more and more sophisticated. They can calmly lure people to secluded places to strike. Every time they are caught by the police, instead of repenting after being released, they increase their experience, making their methods more precise, and various plans emerge one after another, making it possible for people to fall into their trap anytime and anywhere. Now that the police are supposed to be more vigilant against petty criminals, it seems that they should be even more strict!

### Treating Symptoms with Symptoms

— Zhuo Qiu

There has been much discussion recently about the issue of whether or not to abolish the "rotating credit associations," but whether or not they can be banned is a matter of fact. Here, I will only talk about their current situation.

The term "rotating credit association" used to be popular only among the lower and middle classes of non-intellectuals, because the unusually high interest rates were indeed suspected of forming usury, which was not only despised by informed people, but also made the associations themselves difficult to sustain, and it can be said that nineteen out of ten died halfway.

Now, the industrial and commercial sectors are being squeezed internally by high interest rates and externally by taxes. Most are swaying in the storm. Financial institutions and other creditors are pressing for debt like bailiffs at the door. The bloodless usury will endlessly inflate the principal itself. Daily interest of tens or hundreds of thousands makes the productivity of an ordinary factory or store further and further away, approaching the eve of collapse.

The industrial and commercial sectors also know that forming a rotating credit association is like drinking poison to quench thirst, but they can't take out any more loans. They still want to try their best to support their own business, even if it means patching up the old to keep things going.

Small-scale rotating credit associations, with as little as thirty to fifty thousand yuan, are also very popular among factory workers and shop assistants. The meaning of these small organizations is similar to the former. It's nothing more than that in a situation of some urgent need, rather than attempting usury, it is better to "treat symptoms with symptoms." Now, rotating credit associations are regarded by businessmen as a social nicety. Often, one person serves as a member of more than a dozen associations, and in order to obtain reciprocal obligations, they also imitate the practice and become a head of an association once.

Here and Now

### Mutual Aid

— Xiu Shi, Que Chou

Who says that humans are only selfish and self-serving? I admit that we Chinese have always had the virtue of mutual aid. If you don't believe me, you'll know when you take a rickshaw across the bridge!

### Rare is Muddleheadedness

— Suo Bei

The US dollar jumps, the common people shout, prices rise, the common people yell. But optimists still say: "Every year is hard, but every year passes." It can be seen that water can be blocked with earth, and "the boat will naturally go straight when it reaches the dock!"

Is this what is meant by "rare is muddleheadedness"?

### I Want Your Dog's Life

— Du Xin

Because "rabies" injures and kills people, the authorities have issued a "killing stray dogs" order to eliminate future troubles. All the captured dogs are killed with gas, dying of poisoning. Thus, big and small dogs alike have had "dog luck" from now on!

Because pork prices are high and the supply is not smooth, dog meat is already being sold in the suburbs. Two thousand yuan buys a pound, which is cheaper than pork anyway.

This is called "I want your life, I want your 'dog's life', and 'cooking its meat and eating it' to gratify the palate and do one's best to take revenge!"

Horses that harm the herd are certainly not to be tolerated, and dogs that harm the herd are also not to be tolerated; people who harm the herd are even more intolerable!

Today, I really want to eat the "fat" and "oily" meat of some people to vent that pent-up resentment.
