### The National Army Advances Rapidly on All Fronts; The Siege of Datong is Imminent; Several Strongholds in the Suburbs have been Recaptured

[Special Dispatch from Beiping, 8th] The defending army of Datong telegraphed this morning to the responsible officials here that the strongholds north of the city, such as the railway station, alcohol factory, and flour mill, which were once lost, have been retaken. Furthermore, several small strongholds lost at the beginning of the fighting have also been recovered. Although the Communist army's attacks remain fierce and they continue to bombard the city with artillery, their siege forces seem to be gradually decreasing, possibly due to the critical situations in Jining and Fengzhen, where troops have been transferred for support. If Fu Zuoyi's troops make rapid progress, Datong may turn from danger to safety. The Communist army besieging Ying County south of Datong has been unable to capture it after a long siege, and has decided to breach the Hun River dike. The water level at the east gate of Ying County has reached shoulder height, and the entire city is in danger of being flooded. In other news, a certain unit of the National Army is crossing the Yellow River and heading north.

[Special Dispatch from Guihua, 7th] The defending army of Datong was pleased to hear that friendly forces advancing from the west had occupied Zhuozi Mountain. Today, they launched an attack from the city gates, and the Communist army's encirclement is gradually loosening. All parties here expect that the siege of Datong can be lifted by the Mid-Autumn Festival.

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 8th] The battle for Datong continues to be fierce. The National Army is continuously reinforcing its troops, gradually stabilizing the situation. Xinhua News Agency's dispatch from Huairen on the 7th stated that refugees had fled from Datong city, clearly acknowledging that Datong had not been captured. Furthermore, the agency's dispatch from Zhangjiakou acknowledged that the Communist army in eastern Hebei had suffered setbacks in successive battles, with Xianghe being captured by the National Army on the 5th and Sanhe on the 4th.

[Special Dispatch from Guihua, 7th] The Communist army previously entrenched at Zhuozi Mountain was the 358th Brigade, a core unit of He Long's forces. After the National Army moved in, 400 bodies were found on the northwest high ground alone. Currently, the Communist army is retreating in a southeast direction, and our cavalry has approached the outskirts of Jining City.

[Special Dispatch from Guihua, 7th] The Communist army launched a counterattack on Zhuozi Mountain from the night of the 5th to the morning of the 6th, abandoning 200 bodies before retreating. The political commissar of the regiment, Lu Zhengqi, and the battalion commander, Li Daming, defected. The Communist side had established a puppet Longsheng County in Zhuozi Mountain. After the National Army entered the city, it exempted all taxes and miscellaneous levies imposed by the Communist army and announced to self-cultivating farmers that they should no longer settle accounts with the poor, but resolve issues through legal means.

[Special Dispatch from Guihua, 7th] Two hundred civil servants from Suiyuan Province are scheduled to depart from Guihua on the 7th, with their destinations being the four counties of Jining, Fengzhen, Xinghe, and Liangcheng.

[Central News Agency, Guihua, 8th] After the National Army recovered Zhuozi Mountain, the Communist army in Datong has shown signs of wavering and has been actively reinforcing Jining, seemingly with the intention of advancing westward. In the battle of Zhuozi Mountain, most of the fortifications built by the Communist army were constructed using railway tracks, with some even using reinforced concrete, making them extremely solid. However, the National Army, with the assistance of the people, finally achieved victory.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 8th] Yan'an telegraphed today, acknowledging some of the victories won by the National Army.

[Special Dispatch from Beiping, 8th] The National Army in eastern Hebei is making rapid progress. The troops that recovered Xianghe recaptured Baodi County this morning at 10:00 AM. The National Army advancing from Tangshan also recaptured Yutian. The two forces from the east and west will soon meet in this triangular area. This eastern Hebei mop-up operation is divided into four routes, taking an encircling formation. One route started from Tong County east of Beiping, recapturing Xianghe, Sanhe, and Baodi in recent days, and is now advancing towards Jixian and Zunhua. Another route started from Tangshan, advancing along two routes, east and west. The eastern route recaptured Leting and now controls the central area of the western area. Another route advanced southwest from Shanhaiguan, recapturing Lulong yesterday. Another route recaptured Xifengkou from outside the pass, blocking and sealing off the area. Since the operation began last week, seven cities have been recovered. Li Yunchang's forces, which had dominated eastern Hebei, are on the verge of collapse, and the Beining Railway can be kept safe. It is reported that the Communist army had already prepared for this half a month ago, withdrawing all levels of "government" from the county towns to the villages. The "Eastern Hebei Administrative Office" in Zunhua and the "14th Special District Office" in Yutian had already left. The defection of Zhu Zhankui, deputy commander of the 14th Military Sub-district of the Communist army in eastern Hebei, and his troops has dealt a great blow to the Communist army, as he led troops from Gubeikou to reinforce the area but defected to the National Army midway. Zhu had served in the 29th and 53rd Armies during the early stages of the War of Resistance, fighting guerrilla warfare, and was awarded the title "Iron-Blooded Man" by the Hebei Provincial Government. He later joined the Communist army.

[Special Dispatch from Taixian, 8th] (1) The Communist army took advantage of a weak spot to attack Dasizhuang, but was met by the local self-defense forces and failed to achieve anything. National Army vehicles have now rushed to reinforce the area. (2) There have been continued small-scale skirmishes on the Ma Gou front line. (3) The defenses of Taixian are consolidated.

### Jehol Province Carries Out Construction; Six County Magistrates Appointed

[Special Dispatch from Beiping, 8th] The Jehol Provincial Government is actively making constructive arrangements, reorganizing local forces, and developing county administration in the newly recovered areas. The newly appointed magistrates of the six counties of Chengde, Luanping, Longhua, Weichang, Fengning, and Chifeng have all taken office.

According to Du Yuming's post-inspection comments regarding Chengde, there are no Communist troops within 150 li around Chengde. The war in Jehol has not yet reached its end. He will soon join forces with the 11th War Zone troops in Jehol. He also stated that the Communist side's claim that they had obtained American equipment from the National Army and that they already had four divisions with American equipment was not entirely true. The Communist army had obtained only six battalions' worth of equipment and other scattered weapons from the National Army, at most enough for three divisions. However, the Communist side would have no way to replenish the ammunition for this equipment, so it would be equivalent to having nothing.

After the commemorative week ceremony, President Chiang addressed all the participating representatives, stating in brief: The Republic of China has been established for 5,000 years and has its own excellent civilized tradition. All of our citizens and youth should not neglect it in the slightest, and even more so, they should not violate the inherent morality of our country for 5,000 years and blindly follow foreign countries, rely on foreign countries, neglect our country's inherent culture and morality, and willingly become spiritual slaves to foreign countries, promoting the destruction of our country's culture and morality. Those who rely on foreigners and are manipulated by foreigners will have no future. It must be understood that the Kuomintang and the Youth Corps have an inseparable relationship, and they cannot blame each other and shirk responsibility. They should cooperate closely and intensify efforts to build a new China. Today's address lasted for over an hour, and all participants were deeply moved after listening to it. Then President Chiang personally called the roll, and it ended at about 1:00 PM.

We call on the youth of the whole country to participate in this Corps, and we will never use rights and status as a means of inducement. In the past, the general public in our country regarded taking office and becoming an official as the only way out for their children. This kind of concept must be broken. Youth who participate in this Corps should all aspire to engage in grassroots construction and social reform work to serve as a model for the youth of the whole country. At present, the obstacles to our party's revolution have not yet been eliminated, and the work of national construction is extremely difficult. We should promote our country's traditional national spirit and morality, become stronger despite setbacks, be indomitable, advocate benevolence and love, unite sincerely, and jointly seek thorough reform and active development of party and corps affairs, so as to promote the glorious history of our party in the past. As for the scope of work and cadres of the party and the corps, they can be properly divided so that the Youth Corps can truly become a youth organization that is owned, managed, and enjoyed by the youth.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 8th] A central spokesperson corrected the external reports that Marshal Marshall and Ambassador Stuart had told the Communist Party that if the Communist Party participated in the five-person group meeting, they would do their best to urge the government to issue a ceasefire order. The atmosphere in the Communist Party headquarters today is gloomy, seemingly expressing despair about the situation. A certain CCP official denied that Zhou Enlai had telegraphed Yan'an requesting permission to participate in the five-person group meeting, because Zhou had the authority to make the decision. Therefore, any development depends on President Chiang's final decision. Marshal Marshall can bring this resolution back with him when he returns to Nanjing.

### The Government Decides to Transfer all Japanese Industries to Private Management; The China Textile Industries Corporation's Factories Will Gradually be Transferred to Private Management within Two Years

[United Press, Nanjing, 7th] The National Government, in order to overcome the stagnation of product exports, has ordered the Central Trust Bureau to purchase all silk produced in the country and is considering taking similar action for other major products such as tung oil, tea, and bristles.

Wang Yunwu Speaks to Foreign Reporters

Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu met with the reporter of United Press Agency and said: This move is equivalent to subsidizing important products because the government sells them to various countries at a price lower than the purchase price. Currently, silk production is slightly over 1,000 dan, only a small portion of the pre-war production. High cost of living, transportation difficulties, and high wages are the three major obstacles to China's economic recovery. Silk merchants in Jiangsu and Zhejiang are also hesitant and dare not develop their businesses. The government has no choice but to take action. Purchasing tea will also result in losses. Tung oil is better, only bristles can offset the losses. In order to continue efforts to stabilize the economy, the government intends to transfer all Japanese industries to private management before September 30th, except for heavy industries, because of their large scope and the need for government management, such as the textile industry. The China Textile Industries Corporation's yarn factories will be transferred to private management or sold shares one by one within two years. The value of the remaining Japanese industries to be transferred to private management in the Shanghai area alone is US$500 million. Industrialists who suffered losses during the wartime relocation will be given priority. If these industries are not sold after two auctions, there are three other ways to acquire them: (1) Immediate payment, calculated at 70% of the assessed value; (2) Installment payments without discounts; (3) Lease for two years, with interest calculated at the assessed value of percentage point paid, and the stipulation that the lessee must purchase it when the lease expires. In Shanghai, 40 factories are handled according to the first method, and 100 factories are handled according to the second method. The government also hopes to return the factories forcibly occupied by the Japanese to their original owners within the month. The improvements made by the Japanese in the equipment of the forcibly occupied factories will be sold to the original owners according to a plan of repayment over two years without interest. The China Textile Industries Corporation has 1.7 million spindles, and two-thirds of them are already in operation. It is hoped that all of them will be in operation within the year. The Ministry of Economic Affairs also takes a "firm stand" on the increase of labor. Unless the number of employees is expanded and it is beneficial to the general labor, the Ministry of Economic Affairs opposes further increases in labor. In order to prevent the "soaring" of rice prices, the government is now considering storing one year's worth of grain. The price of rice is currently trending downward due to the bumper harvest. As for land reform, the government must seriously consider it sooner or later, but it will not take drastic measures for the time being.

### UNRRA Operations to Conclude Next Autumn; Review Meeting Concludes Successfully Yesterday; Li Zhuomin Reports on Attending the UNRRA General Assembly

[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The four-day UNRRA work review meeting officially concluded at 5:00 PM on the 8th, with extremely satisfactory results. The most noteworthy event at today's meeting was the report by Deputy Director Li Zhuomin of the UNRRA China Office. Mr. Li had just returned from Geneva after attending the Fifth UNRRA General Assembly and provided a very detailed report on the proceedings. In his speech, Mr. Li announced that by the end of March next year, the budget UNRRA will allocate to China will not be less than US$562.5 million, plus maritime freight and the maintenance costs of foreign technical personnel, totaling over US$700 million. This matter was guaranteed by UNRRA Director General Fiorello La Guardia. Regarding the deadline for UNRRA's material assistance to China, the UNRRA Central Committee had considered three months ago that ending it by the end of March next year would be too hasty. The General Assembly decided that the deadline for purchasing and selling some UNRRA materials in China could be extended beyond the end of March, meaning that UNRRA could still supply materials to China after that date. Another issue was the deadline for the end of UNRRA's operations in China. Regarding this, La Guardia told Mr. Li that the current orders might not arrive until August or September next year, so the termination date had not been decided. Mr. Li believes the period will be in the fall of next year. As for the deadline for the work of foreign technical personnel, China also advocates extending it beyond the end of March next year, and the United States has agreed.

Following this, Director-General Jiang Tingfu delivered a speech, stating that based on the various decisions of the UNRRA General Assembly, the end date for UNRRA operations will be in August or September next autumn. Regarding the working period, I (Jiang referring to himself) do not hope for excessive extension, as UNRRA is a temporary organization. Health affairs should be handled by the Ministry of Health, and agriculture should be the responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. The sooner the government takes over these tasks, the better, and extension is not a good thing. Mr. Jiang also stated that US$562 million in materials is equivalent to three times China's annual imports before the war, and our responsibility is significant. We should put more effort into transportation and distribution. After the speech, each subgroup reported on the opinions on the proposals reviewed in the afternoon of the 7th, and the fourth session of the General Assembly did not adjourn until around 12 o'clock.

[Report from Our Newspaper, Hankou, 8th] The Xiang, E, and Gan Investigation Team issued a public announcement at 3:00 AM this morning, uncovering a shocking corruption case involving the auction of materials at Jianghan Customs. The total amount of corruption is estimated to be at least 1.2 billion yuan. The announcement, which is 20,000 words long, lists the facts and figures regarding suspected corruption and illegal activities, resembling an indictment. The main points are as follows: (A) The selling price in non-public auctions was even 30% lower than the auction floor price, such as with matches and sulfides; (B) The pricing of the auction and the release of goods were all handled by one person, the quantity of materials was arbitrarily reduced, the floor price was repeatedly lowered, and there were excuses of mildew to deliberately underestimate the value, such as with Japanese cigarettes; (C) The same items were auctioned at the same time, but the prices varied greatly, such as with white paper; (D) The buyers of each auction were Yonghe, Mingji, and a dozen other companies, and the same buyer would deliberately bid for the same item in several rounds, with the floor price gradually decreasing, showing that they had ulterior motives (numbers and examples omitted). In summary, the customs received a total of 3.3 billion yuan from 13 auctions of materials. Based on the precise estimate of the above-mentioned corruption, the loss is at least 1.2 billion yuan. The team has decided to send this case to the court for investigation and prosecution, and recommends that the authorities promptly revise the auction regulations.

### Congratulating the Opening of the First Session of the Municipal Council and Commemorating the Double Ninth Victory Day

Today marks the one-year anniversary of the day when General Yasuji Okamura, the supreme commander of the Japanese forces in China, formally surrendered to the Supreme Commander of our country. This is the most glorious victory anniversary in our nation's history and deserves our enthusiastic celebration. However, recalling the nation-building efforts of the past year, which have been disrupted by the Communist Party and have not progressed smoothly nor achieved any major successes, we are ashamed to face the martyrs of the war of resistance! On this glorious victory anniversary, we should start from today and make a great determination to build a new China with sweat and blood and preserve the splendid fruits of victory. As for the direction of future efforts, the first is to promote the democratization of politics. The Shanghai Municipal Council is specifically holding its first session today, which has profound significance, and all Shanghai citizens should attach great importance to it. The council is a representative body of the people, and all councilors are elected by the citizens and must represent the 3.5 million citizens of the city in their speech. Observing the motions put forward by the councilors, which have reached more than 310, it can be seen that all councilors will fully express public opinion on various municipal issues. Therefore, the opening of the Shanghai Municipal Council today is the beginning of the democratization of municipal administration in Shanghai.

Shanghai is the first commercial port in China and the cultural center of the country. The large population, the prosperity of commerce and industry, and the urgent need for municipal reform are all above those of other provinces and cities, and it is also a matter of concern to both China and foreign countries. In the post-war world, which has entered a new era of peace and democracy, the democratization of Chinese politics is not only a consistent demand of the entire country but also an expectation of friendly countries. However, the evolution of democratic politics has its own trajectory and must be allowed to develop naturally. At the beginning of its germination, it is necessary to pay attention to the cultivation and advocacy of democratic style. In Shanghai, after the city's restoration, the government actively prepared for the establishment of the municipal council. However, due to technical difficulties, the general election could not be completed overnight. Therefore, a temporary council was established first to give public opinion the opportunity to be heard, and the municipal authorities could also adopt the opinions provided by many social elites as much as possible for the sake of gathering ideas. However, this transitional method is only a temporary measure, so a general election was officially held soon. Well-known people from all walks of life actively participated in the election, and although some unsatisfactory things happened, it was still a good sign of the election atmosphere in a democratic country. If we want political democratization, we must learn as much as possible to cultivate the style of democratic politics. Empty calls for democracy will never bring democracy from the sky. Therefore, we have the following two expectations for the municipal council that opened today:

First, the most important condition for implementing political democratization is to cultivate a democratic style and attitude among the people. Although there were democratic ideas in Chinese political history very early, politicians in the past dynasties emphasized ritual governance rather than the rule of law, so there was no basis for democratic politics. If we want to talk about democracy today, we must first cultivate the democratic demeanor of the people and create a democratic tradition. The dissemination of this style depends on the advocacy of the councilors. Therefore, we hope that all councilors can set an example and have a democratic demeanor, and pay attention to their attitude when discussing various issues and debating with others. Furthermore, when speaking, they must also consider whether they can represent the opinions of the citizens. The so-called democratic politics is based on public opinion from the bottom up, and no pretense is allowed.

Second, all councilors come from all walks of life and are deeply aware of the hardships of the people's lives. As representatives of the people, they must speak on behalf of the people as much as possible. At the same time, they have also made various promises to the voters during the election, and it is hoped that they can fulfill them. Therefore, the proposals put forward by the councilors are inevitably complex. However, the municipal council itself is limited by time and technology. If it wants to present all proposals for discussion and allow each councilor to freely express their opinions, it will be impossible. Therefore, we advocate that the proposals of each councilor should be prioritized, and attention should be paid to their feasibility. The media can also assist from the sidelines to promote their realization. Conversely, if there is no focus, then opinions will be divided, discussions will be complicated, and the strength will be dispersed. It will be difficult to reach an agreement on any proposal, and even if it is passed by the General Assembly, it is difficult to hope that it will be implemented.

In short, the Municipal Council is a representative body of the people and has the task of supervising the government. Whether the Shanghai Municipal Council can play its role in reforming the municipal administration of Shanghai is a major test of the democratization of municipal administration in Shanghai.

### Discussing Sports on Sports Day

— Zhou Shang

Today is the "Double Ninth," which is designated as Sports Day by the state. Let us first discuss the meaning and function of sports.

Before we blindly seek a future, we must first ask ourselves if we have a healthy body? Before we blindly encourage a comfortable life, we must first ask ourselves if we have hygienic habits? Before we blindly want to be a first-class power, we must first ask ourselves if we have a first-class physique?

The three essential elements that create a nation's life are: environment, culture, and heredity, with heredity being the most important. The nation's vitality is its military power, economy, and education, with education as the general hub. Education has three aspects: moral education, intellectual education, and physical education, with physical education as its foundation.

The term "physical education" is translated from the English term "Physical Education," meaning the education of the body. In today's holistic education era, some people question this term and want to replace "physical education" with "sports." However, before the word "sports" is widely adopted, it is still called physical education. Physical education itself is really not an end, but a method, a tool. Its meaning is a kind of education that uses the large muscle activity of the body as a tool to achieve educational goals. The word "activity" here refers to all organic activities, such as the thoughts and emotions in learning, and all learning responses to the environment.

The purpose of physical education should be in line with modern educational philosophy, educational purposes, and educational goals. The purpose refers to a broad and general trend toward the highest standard, which is higher than the goal, but not necessarily achieved immediately. The goal is analyzed from the purpose, indicating special points, easy to achieve, and a necessary stage to achieve the purpose. The purpose of physical education is to provide intelligent and capable leaders, excellent and reasonable environments, and suitable sports opportunities, so that individuals or groups can obtain healthy bodies, happy spirits, and sound social personalities in this situation. The goals of physical education should be (1) developing personal organic organization, (2) developing the skills of the neuromuscular organization, (3) developing good sports attitudes, and (4) developing moral behavior standards.

Since the establishment of new education in the early years of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty, physical education has always been mistaken for competitive sports, overemphasizing training to win medals and break records, only cultivating a few athletes, who often fight and quarrel during competitions; and those who are called athletes are rarely long-lived and mostly short-lived. Experts who mistake competitive sports for physical education should have the opportunity to watch the film "The Light of the Soviet Union" to know how people implement physical education. Some schools have physical education classes where teachers and students wear long clothes and shout one, two, one, two, without sweating a drop; in this way, the original purpose of physical education is lost. Even if we talk about athletes, compared with the Westerners, they have become nothing more than food sacks and wine bags. I remember in 1936, 139 athletes from our country participated in the Berlin World Games and were completely defeated! During the basketball game, our side had the opportunity to shoot 24 free throws, but we did not make a single one, which shows that not only is the technology inferior to others, but the physical quality is even inferior to others. In this case, how can we mechanize our national defense? Modernize our country?

The ancient Chinese six arts education is the three educations. Zheng Xuan said: "Shi is the master of the princes, who has virtue to teach the people; Ru is the protector of the princes, who has six arts to teach the people." This is much earlier than the West. Ancient Greek education emphasized body and mind. It was not until the rise of religious education in the Middle Ages that moral education (Soul) emerged, and the three educations were completed, which was much later than the six arts education in our country. The shooting and archery of the six arts is to promote the implementation of physical education, starting from personal physical training and then cultivating the basic skills of national defense; in individuals, it is "both civil and military talent," and in the country, it is "those who have civil affairs must have military preparations," implying safeguarding the country in health.

The music education in our country, which includes dancing with spoons and dancing with elephants, teaches rhythmic and harmonious sports training, which shows that the ancients always attached great importance to physical education. Football, the national sport of England, was invented in our country long ago, and was called Cuju in ancient times. Later, this game progressed to using horses as a substitute, and became today's polo. It can be seen in Tang poems and Song paintings. Chinese physical education attaches great importance to morality. The third chapter of the Analects of Confucius, "The Eight佾舞," records Confucius saying, "The gentleman does not compete for anything, but he must also shoot? He bows and ascends, and then descends and drinks, his competition is also a gentleman." And as Su Dongpo said, "Winning is certainly pleasant, and losing is also gratifying." The "sportsman spirit" of Westerners is our gentleman spirit, which is manifested everywhere in training discipline and morality in sports. If you move without talking about morality, it is easy to become brave and fight; this can produce two opposite extremes, one is to evolve into chaos, and the other is to despise physical education because of choking. The nation-state suffers a lot!

The disadvantage of emphasizing literature over military affairs is the separation of civil and military affairs. Once civil and military affairs are separated, not only is it difficult to know, but it is also difficult to act. The imperial examination began at the end of the Tang Dynasty, and civil and military affairs were separated from then on. By the Song Dynasty, it was even more unimaginable. The national health declined from this, and the culture also declined. The American psychologist Stanley Hall said, "The golden age of a culture must have a golden age of the body thirty years before." We can see that the strength of Emperor Gaozu and Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty, the plumpness of Yang Guifei, and the fact that "Lady Guo rides a horse to enter the palace gate at dawn" show how martial a woman was. The palace maids at that time were also very healthy and mighty. There is Wang Jian's palace poem as proof: "The palace maids who shoot with bows wear red makeup, and each of them holds a new bow." At that time, the country was strong and prosperous. By the time of the second master of the Southern Tang Dynasty, it had fallen into disrepair. Since Li Houzhu "can't stand the cold in the fifth watch in the night," no wonder he wants to "sink his waist and wear his temples." Hua Rui, a demon woman at the beginning of the Song Dynasty, said that the demise of Meng Shu was: "140,000 troops disarmed together, and there was not a single man." By the time of Emperor Huizong and Emperor Qinzong of the Northern Song Dynasty, their bodies could not support it even before the alliance under the city. The Southern Song Dynasty was even more decadent, and Li Qingzhao described women as "thinner than yellow flowers," which shows their fragility and morbidity.

Looking at the entire country, it is enough to prove the consistency of health, martial arts, and culture. This is a historical lesson, which proves that culture cannot be separated from health and military affairs. When literature prevails over quality, there is a danger of national subjugation. What's more, our "literature" is far inferior to others! During the War of Resistance Against Japan, I personally investigated the physiques of one million young men, the young people who applied for the Air Force from the tenth to the twentieth terms, and the students who applied for military academies in the tenth term. Only about 30% of them passed the physical examination, and only about 10% of those who passed the Air Force examination on average. However, sports men accounted for the majority. This is really enough for us to think deeply.

In the future, physical education must be implemented in a practical way. First, the Physical Education Committee of the Ministry of Education should be strengthened. Now, two of the three standing committee members of the committee are said to be working in other places, and one is running around. How can they bear the important responsibility? Second, from the central government to the local governments, all physical education administrators must have knowledge, skills, and enthusiasm, and they must have aspirations for building the country. Third, quickly train a large number of school physical education teachers and mass physical education talents. Fourth, expand the public's sports fields, swimming pools, gymnasiums, and other social sports activity venues as much as possible. Fifth, build and enrich school sports fields, swimming pools, gymnasiums, and other sports equipment. Sixth, pay attention to mass and individual physical education on a daily basis. When holding sports meets, there should be more large-group physical education performances and fewer individual medal competitions. Look at our neighbors! Look at the defeated Japan, and look at the Soviet Union that won the Anti-Japanese War. What are their sports like? From here, we can measure our future, our life, and our country.

### Adapting to the Needs of the Atomic Warfare Era; The US Navy Builds New Warships; Equipped with Rocket Launchers and Directional Explosives; The Third Atomic Bomb Test Indefinitely Postponed

[Report from Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 8th Broadcasting: Naval warfare has entered a revolutionary new era. Two new US warships have been equipped with radio-controlled bombs. At the same time, official reports also confirmed that the US has designed and manufactured two atomic warships to resist atomic bomb attacks, one is the "Kentucky" battleship with a displacement of 45,000 tons, and the other is the "Hawaii" cruiser with a displacement of 27,000 tons. These two warships were produced after this atomic bomb test.

[United Press, Washington, 7th] The United States is currently building the first batch of warships of the atomic age. The ships are equipped with rocket multiple launchers to replace the old-fashioned cannons. The Navy Department announced that the 45,000-ton battleship "Kentucky" and the 27,000-ton battle cruiser "Hawaii" will be equipped with directional explosives. The two ships were originally planned according to the old design. At the end of World War II, rockets and atomic bombs appeared, opening a new era. The two ships were redesigned. Navy designers informally stated that long-range directional bombs can be fired using radio waves, or the steel and heat of the target itself can be used to attract the bombs. However, the plan to equip the rocket with an atomic bomb warhead is still under study.

[Associated Press, Washington, 8th] In recent weeks, the United States' policy towards the Soviet Union has become increasingly tough, especially with the development of the Paris Peace Conference and the American South incident. However, the possibility of armed conflict is not credible, because there are still many political and external security measures that can be tried. The United States' shift to a tougher attitude towards Moscow seems to be supported by the domestic people, and some experts believe that the growth of public sentiment is even faster than the official.

[Associated Press, Washington, 7th] President Truman issued an order today to indefinitely postpone the third atomic bomb test, which was scheduled to be held next spring, saying that in the near future, the knowledge that can be obtained from deep-sea tests is not worth the cost. According to White House Press Secretary Ross, the postponement is not a cancellation, but only an indefinite postponement. Truman made this decision on the recommendation of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Army and Navy Department, and the Atomic Bomb Test Evaluation Committee. It is said that scientists and military experts have been able to estimate the effectiveness of the Chenzi bullet based on the knowledge gained from previous tests. The General Staff is "very satisfied" with the results of the two tests.

### Where Does the Soviet Union Intend to End Up? - Secretly Researching Atomic Energy - Actively Manufacturing Tanks and Cannons

The American expert stated that his information was obtained from extremely reliable sources, saying that the Soviet government is sparing no expense in research funding, in order to realize Molotov's previous statement that "We, too, shall have the atomic bomb." He added that Soviet scientists have already learned most of the principles of nuclear fission.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 8th] The "Daily Mirror" today accused the Soviet Union of manufacturing tanks, cannons, airplanes, and rocket bombs in factories in Germany. It stated: Soviet actions are evidenced by secret documents, and its intentions are likely to be fear of attack. At this moment, the United Kingdom and the United States should resolutely take action, forcing the Soviet Union to reveal the truth before the situation becomes unmanageable.

### Soviet Union Celebrates Tank Day

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 8th] Today is the Soviet "Tank Day," and Stalin has ordered celebrations. The Fourth Armored Division will hold exercises in Red Square. In his proclamation, Stalin praised the achievements of the Soviet armored forces in the Great War and commended the success of Soviet tank manufacturers.

According to the boundary line suggested by France, Gorizia will be divided into southern and Italian parts, Belarus suggested that the city be fully returned to the South. At today's peace conference, Ukrainian representative Betrovsky supported Belarus' amendment, pointing out that the boundary line suggested by France would establish an artificial corridor between the Port of Trieste and Monfalcone, depriving Slovenia of access to the sea and severing the economic ties between Slovenia and neighboring provinces. Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Kardelj then spoke, declaring that if the unreasonable state caused by the boundary line suggested by France is not corrected, Yugoslavia will refuse to sign any peace treaty with Italy and will never recognize any resolution.

### Cyrenaica Demands Independence

[Reuters, Cairo, 7th] The leader of the Senussi tribe of Cyrenaica (Italian colony in North Africa), Idris, hopes that Cyrenaica will be free and independent, be able to sign a treaty with Britain, and provide Britain with bases and assist it in various aspects. In an interview with reporters here, Idris said: We have been oppressed by the fascists, so we, like other Arab countries, hold the hope of complete independence. After we gain independence, we are willing to negotiate a treaty with Britain that will benefit both sides. Idris opposes entrusting Cyrenaica to a United Nations organization and does not welcome the intrusion of forces with interests similar to those of the Soviet Union into Cyrenaica.

### Puppet Puyi Escorted Back to Vladivostok - Says Emperor Hirohito of Japan Should Be Held Responsible for the War

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 7th] The puppet emperor of Manchukuo, Puyi, was escorted back to Vladivostok yesterday. Before leaving, Puyi met with reporters and made a statement. When asked about his thoughts on the Japanese Emperor, Puyi replied: "The Japanese monarchy is the worst despotic political system in the world, and it is the biggest obstacle to Japan's democratization. The Japanese Emperor must take full responsibility for Japan's criminal actions, especially the responsibility for the war against China and the Pacific War. At that time, if the Japanese Emperor wanted to stop the war, he could have brought the war to a complete end. But he did not do so, and instead issued an edict approving this war. How can his crime be excused? In short, Hirohito's failure to stop the war was not accidental, but a true revelation of the real character of the Japanese monarchy."

### Crossing the English Channel to Paris (Part Two) - The City of Art, Rich with the Aroma of Coffee

— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Xueyan

At the Calais train station, no one came to check passports. The train soon departed, which initially surprised the reporter. Why can one enter the country without checking passports? Knowing this earlier, why did I have to apply for a visa in advance? Wasn't that unnecessary? Later, I learned that the check is done on passengers during the train ride. It turns out that the special train from Calais to Paris picks up passengers directly from the ferry and goes directly to Paris, without stopping in between. Therefore, no passengers can get off the train mid-journey. The train ride takes nearly four hours, which is enough time for the check, so there is no need to crowd the process in Calais. This shows the ingenuity of the French in handling things. Within France, the train is French-style. The carriages are spacious, similar to British trains. However, where a British train would place two seats, a French train places three, which makes it seem more crowded. Yet, the carriage walls have many decorations, which are absent on British trains, showing that an artistic nature is revealed everywhere. From

Calais to Paris, the train takes about four hours. The entire route is full of fields and lush forests, truly worthy of being called fertile land. From time to time, one can see farmers working among them. It is now the autumn harvest season, and horse-drawn carts full of golden harvests slowly drag towards nearby rural homes. The scenery here is a bit like the regions south of the Yangtze River in China, unlike England. The English countryside has rolling hills, and it is rare to see boundless plains. The population is dense, and the houses are closely packed. Even if there is a vast plain, it is mostly turned into a park, planted with flowers and grass, serving as a place for people to play and rest. England has a particularly large number of grasslands, everywhere. Every holiday, the grasslands are filled with tourists resting, having picnics, and spending their holidays. I often feel that the whole of England is one big garden, except for the houses, which are places for people to enjoy. Natural farmland also exists, but it does not occupy an important position in England. According to statistics from the British Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries: the total number of people in the UK whose main occupation is farming is about 700,000, accounting for slightly more than one percent of the total population. No wonder

there are fewer English fields. Moreover, most of English agriculture is livestock, orchards, or vegetable cultivation, and there is very little cultivation of rice and wheat. Most of those engaged in agriculture also use machines to replace labor. When you occasionally see someone working in the fields, there is always a small engine running back and forth on the ridges. There is little actual manual labor, so it is always a strange feeling. Now, seeing the French countryside suddenly makes me think of the situation at home, which feels like returning home. In the French farmland, I also saw many girls and children assisting in the work, which is also similar to China, but absent in England. The train arrived in Paris in the evening. After putting down the luggage in the hotel, after taking a short break, I was taken by a friend to walk on the road to see the night view of Paris, so that the old country bumpkin who just entered the city could broaden his horizons. Although Paris also has narrow streets, the main roads are wide and straight, seemingly endless, and the atmosphere is indeed much larger than London. As for the ingenuity and beauty of the shops, houses, and window decorations along the roadside, London is far behind. It is precisely because the roads are wide and the sidewalks are particularly wide,

Parisian cafes place four or five rows of tables and chairs in front of the store, under the shade of plane trees, allowing customers to sit and drink coffee and watch the pedestrians. It is said that there are more and more guests in the afternoon, and it is even more crowded at night, which is also not available in England. English restaurants and cafes close at dusk, so no matter how lively the street is, it is quiet and sparsely populated by seven or eight o'clock in the evening. Many countrymen who have the habit of eating supper before going to bed are confused when they first arrive in England and go to the streets at night to look for food shops, but they are always disappointed and complain endlessly. The night market in French cafes is no less than the snack shops in China. This is the characteristic of the French who are born to be artists. Whenever the lights and the moon shine together, and the guests are full, the male and female guests laugh and flirt with each other, only knowing how to pursue the joy of life, allowing passers-by to watch, without any scruples. According to those who have been to France before the war:

Although the prosperity of Paris has gradually recovered, compared with before the war, it is now far from what it used to be. I don't know if Parisian youths also had such a reputation during the German occupation? And if unfortunately, they had not won the war, where would these youths go to seek pleasure? Or where would they go to endure the bitterness of life? French perfume is already famous, so there is no need for reporters to say more, but what is strange is that even on the wide roads, you can always smell the fragrance of powder. As for the endless fragrance indoors, it goes without saying. It seems that the entire air covering Paris is permeated with the smell of perfume and rouge. This is a unique taste that people who come to Paris for the first time especially experience. No wonder some frugal artists who came here since the First World War are reluctant to return home and would rather spend the rest of their lives in this country, and it is said that they still rely on the Ministry of Education's scholarship to survive.

### Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu - Talks Freely About the Focus of Future Governance - Supporting Private Enterprises, Promoting Thrift and Increased Production - Establishing Industrial and Commercial Supervisory Offices in Various Regions

Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu met with reporters at his private residence yesterday and gave a brief explanation of the focus of the ministry's future work. He stated: I do not like to talk about plans in grand terms, and I have always advocated being realistic. China should be industrialized and should move towards a planned free economy, which is beyond question. Now let us start with the work of this ministry. This ministry was established during the war, and initially the various departments of agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, and the Resources Commission were all within the scope of the ministry's jurisdiction. Since agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy were separated, the scope has gradually narrowed, but there is still a large affiliated organization, including the Resources Commission. During the War of Resistance, the Resources Commission played an important role in state-owned enterprises and made great contributions. All projects were directly instructed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Recently, the Resources Commission has also been separated. Under such a scope, the focus of the Ministry of Economic Affairs is limited to the economic administrative part, but I strongly agree with this.

Doing Big Things in a Small Area

Because I like to "do big things from small beginnings" rather than "do small things from big beginnings." At the same time, we look at the Soviet Union, where the agricultural and industrial sectors are divided into almost twenty departments, such as the Department of Chemical Industry, the Department of Mechanical Industry, etc., all doing big things in small areas, which can be used as an explanation. In the future, this ministry will be responsible for improving state-owned enterprises and promoting the development of private enterprises in economic administrative work. In short, the important work of this ministry in the future will be to support, supervise, and oversee, and we will spare no effort to fulfill our mission. In order to concretely handle the above-mentioned three major tasks, this ministry is currently planning to establish industrial and commercial supervisory offices in various important industrial and commercial areas across the country to represent the Ministry of Economic Affairs in assisting private industrial and commercial enterprises, promoting restoration work, and organizing industrial loans to increase production efficiency, purely serving the private industrial and commercial sectors. This organization does not conflict with the original industrial and commercial administrative businesses of the construction halls and social bureaus of various provinces and cities. Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, Chongqing, and Shenyang have been selected as the first seven places to be established, and they will be universally established next month. When this office is established, the original special commissioner offices dispatched by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to various places should be closed.

Broaden Your Perspective and Endure Hardship for a While

Regarding how to balance international income, Mr. Wang said: At present, the phenomenon of trade deficit is inevitable in the early stage of national industrial recovery, but there are also two different situations, which cannot be generalized. For example, in some countries, people can save money and reduce their consumption levels to exchange for industrial raw materials, machinery, and increase production, then the trade deficit is normal. In some countries, people not only cannot save money, but indulge in extravagance and extreme enjoyment, then the trade deficit is naturally very dangerous. Our country is in the middle of these two situations. We are close to the red and close to the black. It is really a time for us to be vigilant. Two months ago, when I was meeting at the City Chamber of Commerce, I said that the issue of frugality is very important. Sure enough, the Shanghai Municipal Government has also established a Thrift Movement Committee. Now everyone says that Shanghai's electricity is not enough, but may I ask if the neon lights in the stores that are on all night can be saved and used for factory electricity instead? To draw inferences from one instance, that is to say, everyone must be hardworking, and if everyone is hardworking, foreign luxury goods will not be able to be imported at all. I hope that people all over the country will broaden their horizons, endure hardship for a while, and promote the future achievements of national industrialization. Therefore, when it comes to saving the crisis of trade deficit, first, the people must be frugal; second, the cost of domestic goods must be reduced; third, the quality of domestic goods must be improved. The same applies to import and export trade. Everyone must be vigilant all the time. In a word, "The first Japan has been defeated, and the second Japan may come again." Mr. Wang went on to explain that balancing trade income and expenditure cannot be achieved solely by raising foreign exchange and exempting export taxes. It still depends on the government and the people working together, practicing frugality, and increasing production, which is the fundamental solution.

The Mission of the China Textile Corporation During the State-Run Period

Regarding the business situation of the China Textile Corporation, Mr. Wang said: The monthly business income of the China Textile Corporation is now turned over to the national treasury, and the amount is quite large, which is helpful for balancing the income and expenditure of the national treasury. The corporation itself is working hard to restore production. The factories in Tianjin and Qingdao have been taken over and restored. It seems that it cannot be generalized that "state-run enterprises are not as well-run as private enterprises." Even so, the China Textile Corporation will still abide by the government's promise to completely transfer to private ownership within two years or at most three years. The mission of the China Textile Corporation during the state-run period is twofold: (1) to fully resume work, (2) to get the resumption of work on track. After the mission is completed, it will be handed over to private ownership immediately. As for the future method of transfer to private ownership, there are three options: (1) individual bidding for each factory, (2) individual organization of companies for each factory to sell stocks, (3) selling the stocks of the entire corporation. Which method to adopt has not yet been decided. At this point, the reporter raised two more questions, which Mr. Wang answered as follows:

(Question) There is a shortage of cotton in the Northeast recently, and people are worried about clothing. Does the ministry have a plan for the restoration of production of the textile industry in various regions?

(Answer) The ministry will make full use of the existing equipment of resources in the Northeast to assist in the relocation and development of private enterprises. Those related to people's livelihood industries often aim at achieving self-sufficiency, and the textile industry is one of them. To achieve self-sufficiency, of course, it is necessary to expand production, and there is no distinction between inside and outside the pass, and there is no regional restriction on the scope of material supply. The China Textile Corporation has begun to take over the textile factories in various parts of the Northeast, and it is possible to plan for the resumption of work.

Question: What is the reason for the recent surge in the price of rayon? What is the government's inventory? Is there a way to stabilize prices?

Answer: (1) The reason for the surge in the price of rayon is actually formed by unscrupulous merchants engaging in price gouging and monopoly. (2) The government is unwilling to explain the inventory situation, but recently the government has ordered a large number of finished products from Japan through barter trade. The first batch will arrive in Shanghai this Sunday. The batch of orders is enough for one year. There is no shortage in the market.

### The Municipal Council Opens This Morning - Second Meeting in the Afternoon - Mayor Wu Attends and Reports - Supplementary Election of Councilors Can Be Produced Today

[This Newspaper Report] The first meeting of the first session of the Shanghai Municipal Council will be held starting at 9:00 this morning. The first meeting in the morning will discuss the rules of procedure, the agenda, the organization of the review committee, and the election of councilors. At the second meeting in the afternoon, the mayor will report. Regarding the issue of alternate councilors attending and speaking, the Shanghai Municipal Council has not yet received an internal reply, and it has now decided to issue each alternate councilor an attendance permit and has sent out all the notices yesterday. The alternate councilors do not need to collect them again. The number of proposals received by the council has reached more than 350 as of yesterday, and they are currently being classified and printed in time for distribution at the third meeting tomorrow. A total of 166 councilors have reported. Fei Shusheng, Wu Shaoshu, Zeng Jun, Rong Hongsan, and Wan Molin are on leave for personal reasons. Wang Xiaolai, Wang Zhengting, Ma Shaojun, and others have not yet arrived. The meeting place was not arranged until 11:00 last night. It is very simple and solemn.

### Review Committee - Divided into Ten Groups

[Another News] In order to summarize the various proposals and facilitate discussion and review, the conference specially organized ten review committees (the task of the committee is to review various proposals and policy reports). Each group is attended by familiar personnel. The draft of each unit has been drafted and will be submitted to the conference for amendment when discussing this case at the first meeting. The tasks of the ten review committees are listed as follows: The first group reviews proposals and policy reports on civil affairs and autonomy, the second group reviews police affairs, the third group reviews finance and land administration, the fourth group reviews finance, industry, and economy, the fifth group reviews public utilities and public works, the sixth group reviews education and culture, the seventh group reviews social welfare and labor relief, the eighth group reviews health, the ninth group reviews the city budget (the conveners of other review committees must also participate), and the tenth group reviews legal system and proposals not belonging to other groups (the conveners of other review committees must also participate).

### The High Popularity of Councillor Candidate Jiang Jianbai

It is also reported that in this election of councillors to participate in the National Government, Jin Zhenyu, Qin Liankui, and Jiang Jianbai are the three candidates. It is understood that Dr. Jiang Jianbai, the representative to the National Assembly, has the highest popularity among them. Based on general observations, it is likely that Mr. Jiang will be elected. It is noted that Mr. Jiang has a Ph.D. in Education from Columbia University in the United States. During the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army in 1927, he participated in revolutionary work. Subsequently, he served as Section Chief of the Education Bureau, Section Chief of the Education Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Professor in the University Department of China Public University in this city. During the outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japan, he was ordered by the Ministry of Education to lead education in Shanghai and fight against the enemy and puppets for four years. Later, he was transferred to serve as a commissioner in Burma. After the fall of Burma, he was transferred to serve as a commissioner in India. In 1943, he was appointed as a representative in the United States by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and the Ministry of Education. It is said that he was summoned back to China this spring to attend the National Assembly.

### Our Consul General in Xiangshan, Mei Jingzhou, Returns Home

Mei Jingzhou (see photo), the Consul General stationed in Xiangshan, has been in office for fifteen years since taking office in 1931. Mr. Mei is capable and insightful, and his handling of various overseas Chinese affairs has been praised by the overseas Chinese. Consul General Mei is meticulous in his diplomacy and planning and has responded appropriately. Since the September 18th Incident, he has often delivered English speeches to resist Japan and has written articles to refute the enemy's fallacies, which are widely circulated among Chinese and Western people. After the July 7th Lugou Bridge Incident, Consul General Mei worked even harder for the War of Resistance, often giving speeches on various radio stations, attacking the Japanese aggressors' policies. On the one hand, he sold national salvation bonds to overseas Chinese and encouraged donations to help wounded soldiers and refugees. On the other hand, he promoted Chiang's strategy of leading the entire nation in the War of Resistance. It is reported that Mr. Mei has returned to China to report on his work and will stay for several weeks. Once his mission is completed, he will return to continue serving the country.

### High Prevalence of Venereal Diseases in Shanghai: One in Ten

[Nanjing Electric Dispatch] The Shanghai representative of the Executive Yuan stated in a review meeting of the Executive Yuan today that it is estimated that 300,000 people in Shanghai suffer from venereal diseases, accounting for 12% of the total population.

### Inspection Team Scheduled to Go to Hangzhou Today; Two More High-Profile Cases Received Yesterday

The entire Inspection Team is scheduled to go to Hangzhou by train today. Last night, a State Council meeting was held at the Supervisory Envoy's Office to discuss the handling of unfinished cases and the investigation work and steps to be taken after arriving in Hangzhou. It was also decided that all pending cases in this city would be handled by the Secretariat according to the established guidelines. New cases will not be accepted for the time being. It is reported that the team received two final confidential reports yesterday: one accusing the receiving personnel of failing to include more than 500 taels of gold transferred from a certain large enemy-owned yarn factory during the takeover in the inventory. The other accuses a certain bureau of embezzling the informant's bonus that should have been received for reporting enemy and puppet concealment of property.

### Philippine Airlines Opens New Shanghai-US Route

Philippine Airlines has opened a new route from Shanghai to Manila, Honolulu, and California, USA. The schedule is two flights per week, on Mondays and Fridays. The journey from Shanghai to the United States takes three days. The fare from Shanghai to California is US$965.

### Wang Xiaolai Talks About the Northeast at a Tea Party of the China-South Trade Association: The Northeast is Rich, the People Suffer

Wang Xiaolai, a representative of the Northeast Relief Association, flew from Nanjing to Beiping with Bishop Yu Bin on August 6th, and then went to the Northeast to comfort the refugees. After completing his mission, he returned to Shanghai with them on the evening of the 3rd of this month. The China-South Trade Association of this city held a tea party at 10:00 a.m. yesterday, where Mr. Wang Xiaolai spoke about the current situation in the Northeast and invited the press to attend. Mr. Wang gave a detailed account of what he saw and heard in the Northeast, entitled "Talking About the Northeast." According to him, the current situation in the Northeast has been detailed in Bishop Yu Bin's speech. He only briefly spoke about the wealth of the Northeast and the suffering of the people of the Northeast. At the same time, Mr. Wang plans to invite people from the business community to form a Northeast inspection team to go north to understand the situation in the Northeast. He hopes to gather everyone's wisdom and efforts to develop the Northeast. This proposal will soon be submitted to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for discussion in the hope of realizing it as soon as possible.

Mr. Wang first described the organization of the Northeast Relief Association, which is chaired by Madame Chiang and co-chaired by Mo Dehui. The total relief fund is only 230 million yuan. With the assistance of the government, the same amount of Northeast circulating notes were exchanged, which is actually equivalent to more than 3 billion yuan, greatly benefiting the refugees in the Northeast. At this point, Mr. Wang described in detail the circumstances of attending several mass rallies after arriving in the Northeast. The people of the Northeast were very excited and grateful for the association's relief efforts. In addition, he visited industrial plants in Qingyang, Anshan, Fushun, Siping, Changchun, Jilin, and other places. After the visit, he deeply felt that every plant and tree in the Northeast is very great. The Japanese built a lot in the Northeast during the 14 years of its occupation. According to Mr. Wang, the Japanese in the Northeast were actually different from those in the Southeast. In addition to working hard on construction, they did not cause any damage. The production of the Northeast supported the eight-year war. However, these industrial zones are only superficial at present, and most of the internal machinery has been moved away by a certain party, and then destroyed and burned by the communist army, causing this wealthy Northeast to suffer such trauma, which may not be restored in a short period of time. Mr. Wang also made a heartbreaking statement, "Others did the looting, and we did the burning," which shows the general situation in the Northeast today. The great rivers and mountains have become rubble. Mr. Wang then talked about the suffering of the people in the Northeast. The climate in the Northeast is severely cold. This winter, the people in the Northeast will face serious problems with clothing, housing, and medicine. If preparations are not made in advance, then the compatriots in the Northeast this winter, even if they do not die of starvation, will die of cold. Thinking about it with closed eyes is really unbearable. It is hoped that the government authorities will pay attention to it.

### Grieving Righteous Man Did Not Get to See Peace; All Circles Mourned Shao Xubai Yesterday Morning

The memorial service for martyr Xubai (see photo) was held at the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. More than a thousand people attended, including Du Yuesheng, Xu Jiyin, Lu Jingshi, Feng Youzhen, Xie Dahuang, Xi Yushu, Wang Xiaolai, Zhou Xuexiang, Gui Yanfang, Wang Xianqing, and representatives from various public organizations. The layout of the venue was solemn and respectful. The plaque "Eternal Righteous Spirit" written by Chairman Chiang was hung high at the entrance, and wreaths and elegiac couplets sent by various parties were hung all around. The memorial service began at 10:30 a.m. Mayor Wu could not attend in person due to other important business. Wu Wangwei Shao Shu, Youzhen, Yang Youren, Shui Xiangyun, and Xie Dahuang from the City Party Headquarters acted as attendants. After the ceremony was performed according to etiquette, Lu Jingshi reported on the deeds of Martyr Shao, saying, "It is with deep sorrow that we are attending the memorial service for Martyr Shao today. Because Comrade Shao participated in Party affairs, the students did their best, and even more actively during the War of Resistance. Martyr Shao worked hard for the labor movement. The Seafarers' Anlv Association was led by him, and it is still a labor movement unit. When the National Revolutionary Army retreated westward, in view of the importance of publicity, he ran the Dagong News Agency, which was later closed down. He then set up the Daguang News Agency to send out news that was beneficial to the War of Resistance. The enemy and puppets repeatedly threatened and tempted him, but he remained unmoved. Finally, on the evening when he finished his work and returned to his residence on Fuxu Road, he was ambushed by thugs waiting at the entrance of the alley and sacrificed himself for the country. We are holding this memorial service to hope that we will not fail the martyr's legacy." Subsequently, Chen Baohua, Xie Dahuang, Shui Xiangyun, Feng Youzhen, Wang Xianqing, and others delivered speeches in turn, and Shao Xiehua, a member of the martyr's family, delivered a thank-you speech, expressing gratitude and deep gratitude on behalf of the family. The ceremony ended and the meeting adjourned at around 11:00 a.m. After the meeting, various groups held public memorial ceremonies separately. The participants included (1) the press, (2) the General Labor Union, (3) the Daguang News Agency, (4) the Seafarers' Anlv Association, etc. It did not end until 6:00 p.m.

### Crickets Are Fat Before and After the White Dew; The Market Around Wuma Road Is Lively; More Than 10,000 Are Sold Every Day

[Special Feature by This Newspaper] When God created the world, he had already established the necessary existence of "competition." In nature, the law of the jungle is a common occurrence. There are indeed many who are fond of cruelty and killing, and crickets are just a representative of this!

The day before yesterday was White Dew, the golden age of crickets. Anyone with a little experience in playing with crickets knows that the crickets in the half-month period of seven days before White Dew and seven days after White Dew are the most vigorous and the best at fighting. These few days, on the streets and alleys, and along the relatively quiet roadsides, groups of children are squatting, teasing crickets, driving them to fight to satisfy their "desire for victory" and vent the aggressive nature of human beings. This is not just a child's game. In this metropolis, I don't know how many idle classes and playboys are raising them frantically, using them as a tool for gambling.

The small shops that specialize in selling insects, fish, flowers, and birds around Wuma Road, Liuma Road, and near Xizang Road are the suppliers of crickets in this city. They have established institutions for purchasing crickets in Pudong, Longhua, Caohejing, and Jiaxing, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Jiangbei, and other places, and have specially contracted merchants who transport them in large quantities from the production areas every day. Ordinary crickets are each packed in a small bamboo tube, and the particularly strong ones are treated in a brick pot. They are called "fallen pot goods." It is said that the highest price is tens of thousands of yuan per cricket. Ordinary "fallen pot goods" cost about 20,000 to 7,000 or 8,000 yuan. Because there is no fixed standard price, the price of crickets also varies depending on whether the subject is new or old. They often supply the young masters of the mansions, not according to the number and price, but rather according to the "rewards."

There are four shortcomings when playing with crickets, called: "Dry, old, thin, glutinous." Dry means that the production area of the cricket must be dry, which can be distinguished from the color. Old means whether the age of the cricket is too young or too old, which can be distinguished from the "foot flowers" on the legs and feet. Thin means that the body should be thin, and those that are too fat are not good at fighting. Glutinous means whether the turning is flexible and whether the response to the enemy is smart. This cannot be distinguished without old experience. According to the color, there are also categories such as heavy cyan, purple cyan, and white cyan. Yellow head and red teeth are definitely good goods. White teeth are suitable for a duel in late autumn. The most important point is: the head should be big and the body should be thin. It is always a top-grade thing. If you want to talk about the production area, you have to recommend "Hang insects" – those produced in Hangzhou, Shaoxing, and Zhuji are the best. It is said that small shops around Wuma Road sell more than 10,000 crickets every day. Usually, the crickets that children play with cost 100 yuan for two, 200 yuan for three, and the higher ones cost 500 yuan or 800 yuan each.

### American Films Pour In in Large Numbers; The Drama Circle Is Approaching Its Demise

[Special Feature by This Newspaper] The drama circle in Shanghai, from splendor to plainness, this phenomenon is terrible and serious! People who stay in Shanghai should remember that when drama was at its peak, it had ten theaters: Lyceum, Carlton, Lafayette, Lihua, Jincheng, Jindu, Xinguang, Paris Jiuxing, and Meihua. However, currently, it has been reduced to only two: Lyceum and Guanghua. Drama is in a precarious state, and people who love the arts are worried about it: the end of drama has come.

Although the drama circle has reached its lowest ebb, its glorious battle history in the past is still indelible. During the long nights of the occupation, the works performed by drama, in addition to a few relatively boring comedies, mostly performed relatively gentle and gloomy realist dramas. And the drama circle itself never responded to enemy and puppet plays. There was only "Jiangzhou Weeping Blood," hosted by "Huaying" and cooperating with the "Anti-British and American Association," and "Turning Back Is Shore," cooperating with the puppet police bureau's prevention section.

·Hard Work: Actors Seek to Leave·

After the victory, due to the large influx of American films, fashionable gentlemen and ladies were attracted, and drama was gradually overwhelmed. In a short period of time, the number of theaters was reduced to four: Carlton, Lafayette, Guanghua, and Xinhua ("Lyceum is an irregular theater.") Although the scope of the theaters has shrunk, business is still sluggish. The Shanghai Drama Art Society, which was hosted by playwrights from Chongqing, had very dismal box office sales at the beginning of its performance at "Guanghua." If it weren't for the success of "Promotion Chart," this historical troupe would have collapsed long ago. In addition, "Hard Work," which was performed for a long time at Lafayette, was under economic pressure on the one hand, and on the other hand, because it had not established a rehearsal system over the years, the result of individual development of the actors caused a gap between the actors and the director - the actors despised the director and ignored the comprehensiveness of the drama, thinking that they could cope with the performance with a few good lines. As a result, "Hard Work," which was centered on director Zuo Lin, had internal cracks, and actors sought to leave one after another, and "Hard Work" disintegrated.

However, birds of a feather flock together, and two kinds of people with different understandings of drama were divided into two camps. One is the actors who take profit as the premise and the star system as the means. They take raising the treatment of actors as the slogan and organize their own drama troupe. They have performed "Thunderstorm" and are currently performing "Wen Tianxiang." "China Electric," led by Zhang Junxiang, was unable to overcome the low-level taste of the Shanghai audience for a while due to their serious performance attitude, so their performances of "Teacher for All Generations" and "Return of the Earth" also encountered great economic setbacks. So this true army merged with Zuo Lin in a serious work attitude and recently organized the Audience Drama Company. After the autumn coolness, they will perform Yang Cunbin's "Unofficial History of the Qing Palace" at Lafayette.

·Seeing Through the Worldly Dust: Shangyi Ends·

"Shangyi," which rose up during the Pacific War, was an overflow of the bad drama. Fei Mu led a group of people, disbanded "Huaxin Film Company," and hid the already filmed "National Beauty and Heavenly Fragrance" and "Hong Xuanjiao," which determined their attitude of non-cooperation with the enemy and puppets. They refused to participate in the performance of "Home," which was commemorating the puppet government's return to the capital, by dissolving "Shangyi." They had fought against "Zongyi," which was jointly run by Mei Xi and Mei Qian and the Japanese ronin's "Reporting Department." Although they were secretly flowing in the stratum, they were always keeping warm, clean, and constantly flowing. However, after the arrival of victory, they also encountered economic setbacks. Last month, they received a general notice from the front desk - Carlton: The house will be repaired and the film will be changed, and they will move out by the end of the month. So this troupe with four years of glorious battle history announced its end after performing the commemorative play "The Worldly Dust."

·A Dream of Red Mansions: Backstage Loss·

"Lihua," this small theater, has always been in a precarious state. Because the theater is small, there are few viewers for small plays, and even if large plays are sold out, they will lose money. The performance of "A Dream of Red Mansions" last month was an example. Business was very good, but the backstage still lost money. Now, this "Xinmei," which has no organization and not many actors, has also ended. Although it is said that "Leifeng Pagoda" will be performed in the later stages of "Lihua," there is also a possibility that Shaoxing opera will be performed instead.

"Lyceum" is the property of the British, and he is unwilling to rent it to any drama troupe for a long time, because they have their own musical troupe for irregular performances. They also want to rent it to musical groups and "opera" and "ballet" performances organized by the White Russians. What is currently being performed is the all-star system "Wen Tianxiang." Recent news has come that this ideal theater may be changed to show movies. Then the future of drama will be even more bleak.

·Shangshi Actors Scattered·

Performing "Promotion Chart" for three consecutive months has given "Shangju" in Guanghua a better foundation. "Peacock Gall," which is currently being performed, had already begun rehearsals two months ago. Although the subject and performance are extremely strict, the box office sales are still not good, so this is really a serious problem. There are only two drama theaters in Shanghai, and neither of them can maintain business. The "China Performing Arts Society" spent more than 20 million yuan in capital, and the first shot, "Wen Tianxiang," was still not successful. It is heard that business is still not good. And neither of these two theaters has strong capital and cannot afford to lose money. Also, the Shanghai Experimental Drama Troupe once performed "A New Official Takes Office" and "Spring Cold" at "Lyceum," losing more than 18 million yuan. Recently, actors from "Shangshi," such as Tao Yu, Shu Qiao Wen, etc., who were originally actors from "Zhongwan," have arranged "Qing Dynasty Official History" and are going to Nanjing. Whether to participate in "Shangshi" again is also a problem.

In addition, there is a Drama Association in the Shanghai drama circle, which has held several meetings. Its only task is to organize a "Special Committee" to review and report on film and drama traitors, but so far there have been no results. There is a Drama Welfare Association that has provided some money to poor and sick artists. There is an Actors Friendship Association that held a meeting and wanted to perform a few small plays without success. There is a drama school, which was not very strong at first, but now that some experts have come to Shanghai, his teaching has become stronger.

At present, the Shanghai drama circle is in a low ebb. What is terrible is that the troupes are ending one after another. What is sad is that most drama workers are too lazy to even touch their scripts.

### Commemorating "September 8th Triumph": A Grand Gathering at the Jingu Building

[Report from This Newspaper] On September 8th of last year, Wang Xiaolai, Yang Hu, Xuan Tiewu, Yu Songyun, Zhao Zengyu, Xi Yushu, and other personnel from the municipal government took ten planes from Chongqing to return to Shanghai. To commemorate this "historic day," a "September 8th Triumph Commemoration Party" was held at the rooftop garden of the Jingu Hotel at 7:00 p.m. last night. The initiators and more than 100 guests attended, including Shanghai Miss Wang Yunhai, Xie Jiahua, Peking Opera Queen Yan Huizhu, and others. Speaker Pan Gongzhan and Xu Jiguang also gladly attended.

All participants were grandchildren, meaning that each person had to pay 20,000 yuan to have food. At the same time, raffle tickets were used, which is a fashionable trend recently. Among the prizes were theater tickets for Queen Tianchan and the Grand Stage. Ge Futian repeatedly reported in the microphone that if you win a theater ticket for Queen Tianchan, you can listen to Tan Fuying's Empty City Stratagem on the 9th. One ticket is for two seats and is in the front three rows. Those with a craving for opera were very excited. During the meal, initiator Wang Xiaolai briefly described the origin of the party.

Other programs included Peking Opera by Yan Huizhu, Bai Yuwei, Xie Jiahua, and others, as well as martial arts performances and comedy. They dispersed happily at 12:00.

### The Meaning of Sports Day; Shanghai Sports Day Preparatory Committee

On September 9th of the 30th year of the Republic (1941), the National Government issued a decree to revise the National Sports Law, and designated that day as Sports Day. Therefore, the establishment of Sports Day was undoubtedly to promote the National Sports Law. This is the first point.

The revised National Sports Law was promulgated at a time when the War of Resistance was at a critical stage. In view of the fact that only two or three out of ten draftees called up for military service passed the physical examination, and the unprecedented seriousness of the source of soldiers, the establishment of Sports Day was aimed at promoting the universal attention of the people to sports, improving the national health level, so that they could be efficient producers in peacetime and brave warriors defending the country in wartime, without wasting ammunition. This is the second point.

Every year on this day, provinces and cities across the country have various sports activities to embellish this festival. In terms of form, promoting sports has been done as much as possible. However, in reality, the effect is minimal. Why? It is because of one day of exposure and ten days of coldness. It is because there is no funding and it is just an embellishment. It is because the venues are insufficient and the equipment is simple. Therefore, to commemorate Sports Day, first, sports must be listed as an indispensable part of daily life. Second, the government must include national sports funding in the national budget in accordance with the National Sports Law. Third, a large number of sports venues must be built and their equipment must be enriched. This is because weapons must have venues to be used, and if a worker wants to do a good job, he must first sharpen his tools. This is the third point.

"September 9th" is also the day when Nanjing accepted the surrender last year. Therefore, commemorating this festival in the future has a double meaning. A Western saying goes: "The chest of youth is national defense." We should reflect on this. This is the fourth point.

What is sports? Its latest definition is "education from physical activities." It forms an equilateral triangle with moral education and intellectual education, and cannot be separated. If the three educations are separated, so that the entire equilateral triangle becomes three independent sides, then morality, physical education, and intellectual education will all damage their own lives and weaken their functions. This is the fifth point.

### The Sixth Branch Conducts General Track and Field Test; Wang Xuewu Breaks National Record in Javelin

The Sixth Branch of the [year] regiment held its final general test of track and field training at the Hongkou Zhongzheng Park track and field this afternoon at 4 PM. As a result, Wang Xuewu broke the national record in the javelin with 55.20 meters. Fang Lian's shot put performance was also good, breaking the city's sports meet record for the season with 12.10 meters. Lou Wenao's 3,000 meters also broke the national record with 10 minutes and 3.7 seconds. The results of each event are recorded below:

(1) 100 meters: Tan Qing, 11.4 seconds; (2) 200 meters: Tan Qing, 22.8 seconds; (3) 400 meters: Tan Qing, 54.2 seconds; (4) 800 meters: Lin [obscure], 2 minutes and 11.2 seconds; (5) 1,500 meters: Lin Canran, 4 minutes and 40 seconds; (6) 3,000 meters: Lou Wenao, 10 minutes and 3.7 seconds (breaks national record); (7) High Jump: Jin Kun, 1.65 meters; (8) Discus: Fang Lian, 25.50 meters; (9) Javelin: Wang Xuewu, 55.20 meters (breaks national record); (10) Shot Put: Fang Lian, 12.10 meters.

### The Capital Air Force Basketball Team; Suffers a One-Point Defeat to Ren Yu; The Result is 43 to 42; First Half is 20 to 18

[Report from our newspaper] Although it is not basketball season, with basketball teams from all over the country coming to Shanghai, the city's basketball scene is poised to unfold on a grand scale. Last night at 8 PM, at the stadium, the Nanjing Air Force basketball team played its first game against the city's strong team, Ren Yu. The result was 20 to 18 in the first half, and the overall result was 43 to 42. The expeditionary force suffered a tragic defeat by one point.

Air Force Strength

Looking at the strength of the Air Force, individual skills can be said to be on the standard line. The shortcomings are the lack of teamwork and the use of offensive and defensive methods that are already outdated tactics. They use a five-person zone defense and rely solely on long shots with no guarantee of success. However, success or failure cannot be used to judge heroes. The visiting team's spirit of fighting is indeed commendable. Perhaps there was an abnormal performance under the great scene for the first time, but we will see later. A brief description of last night's battle is given below:

Competition Process

The two teams took the stage on time. The referees were Liu Hesheng and Jin Jiabiao. The visiting team was eager to win, and committed many fouls at the beginning of the game. Ren Yu relied on free throws to get four points first and take the lead. Then Liu Zhenyuan scored, but Ren Yu became rampant again, and the central breakthrough method worked again, taking a remote lead with eight to two. Afterwards, the Air Force joined forces to counterattack, relying on long shots to score, gradually catching up. In the first half, Ren Yu still won by one goal with 20 to 18. After the change of sides, after 24 to 23, Wang Helin of the visiting team made a shot, which was the first time they had exceeded. Since then, the visiting team has taken the lead by four or five points for five minutes. However, the team was unable to defend, and Liang Yongjia of Ren Yu was lively and active, sneaking in and succeeding without fail. Therefore, the overall result was 43 to 42, defeating the visiting team.

### Sports Day and National Sports - Shao Rugan

The victory of the Anti-Japanese War has reached its first anniversary. Today we celebrate the sports festival, and the central government and provinces and cities hold various sports activities to commemorate it, which has a profound meaning and is worthy of praise. On this sports day, we are moving from deep pain to the road of national construction and rejuvenation. The tragic longing has been replaced by the joy of victory, and the commemorative festival for the surrender has arrived, making us feel even more excited and joyful. There are many ways to build a country, but the construction of national sports is the foundation for strengthening the nation. The prosperity of a nation is based on the accumulation of national physical strength. When the national physical strength is strong, the nation will also become strong. Conversely, it will be a weak nation. What is the physical strength of our Chinese nation? The backwardness of national sports and the crisis of national physique are causing great hidden worries. According to expert surveys and statistics, the average life expectancy of Americans is 60 years old, while the average life expectancy of Chinese people is 30 years old. During the Anti-Japanese War, based on the experience of new recruits and the results of physical examinations of young people in various military academies and schools, it was proved that too few passed. The Air Force accounted for 4%, and conscription accounted for 25%. Most of them could not meet the conditions for military service, and the weakness of the general national physical strength was enough to affect the entire national strength. As one of the five great powers after the war, there should be a strong country, a strong people, and a strong race.

It has been more than 30 years since our country promoted sports. Perhaps because of the vast land and population, it is not easy to popularize it to the whole people. Or because of talent and economic relations, the organization and environment have failed to adapt to the needs of the times. Or because of the trends of popular customs, it has failed to cater to modern sports thought. Although all parties have enthusiastically promoted it and comrades have worked hard to implement it, the internal factors and external influences have not shown significant progress. Sports practitioners should of course be responsible, but the lack of self-improvement spirit among the people is also a major reason.

During the Anti-Japanese War, in order to awaken the people across the country to pay attention to sports training and expand the propaganda of national sports, the Ministry of Education issued the "Key Points for Holding Sports Day (September 9th)" in the Ministry Order No. 221156 on June 9th of the 31st year of the Republic (1942). The educational administrative organs of various provinces and cities should be responsible for organizing national sports activities on Sports Day, and invite schools, organs, and groups in the area to form a committee to handle them. A week before Sports Day was designated as Propaganda Week. Publications and newspapers were used for written propaganda, and important activity methods were promoted to the people by members and students of organs and schools. The sports activity items were determined according to local people and conditions, such as Chinese martial arts, race walking, mountain climbing, swimming, horseback riding, rowing, racing, weightlifting, ball games, track and field, etc., which could be adopted as appropriate. In addition to publicizing the significance and methods of sports, various sports activities were carried out in accordance with the local environment.

In addition to the key points for methods announced by the Ministry of Education on the Sports Day of the Victory Anniversary, the Central Propaganda Department, the Central Headquarters of the Three People's Principles Youth League, the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Social Affairs sent telegrams, and there were also instructions for coordinating the work of the National Health Movement Center: (1) Holding citizen health exercises, (2) Citizen sports conferences, (3) National health lectures, (4) Conducting a major inspection of the cleanliness of public places and streets, (5) Screening hygiene education films, (6) Expanding the publicity week of the National Health Movement.

Today is Sports Day, and major cities across the country are holding sports events. On this commemorative festival, it is a large-scale national construction movement after the victory. We should draw lessons from the past and consider how to build national sports in the new China. Commemorating Sports Day is a powerful movement and also the beginning of national sports. Regardless of gender, age, or occupation, everyone should understand clearly that sports training is a right, and training in sports is an obligation. Everyone should enjoy rights and everyone should fulfill obligations. Then there is hope for the universal development of national sports. Or it is said that Sports Day is the world of sports practitioners or those who are enthusiastic about sports activities. This misconception should be corrected.

As the festival approaches, we feel doubly excited. We must continue to promote with the spirit of commemorating the festival. Then the commemorative day of this Sports Day will have meaning. We must step up the construction of national sports in order to live up to the true meaning of commemorating Sports Day.

The various activities of Sports Day are the motivation to promote national sports. The important principles are described as follows:

(1) Sports activities should be popularized: It is hoped that every citizen will have the opportunity to participate in sports.

(2) Sports activities should be organized: Regardless of vertical or horizontal organization, all schools, groups, and people from all walks of life should rise up to establish a rational sports organization.

(3) Sports activities should be nationalized: Attention should be paid to modern national defense military training, and basic aviation knowledge and skills training must be earnestly promoted.

(4) Sports activities should be academic: Modern sports thoughts should be adapted, sound cadres and talents should be trained, and sports academics should be improved.

(5) Sports activities should be economical: At present, financial and material resources are difficult, and the greatest effort should be made with less economic resources.

Governing is not in much talk, and working is only in hard work. At the time of the commemoration of Sports Day, the author deeply expresses his fervent wishes. Shanghai is the cradle of national sports, and it should take the lead in initiating. Comrades in the national sports world, let us rise up and work together to complete the mission we should bear.

### Group B Branch Champion; The Finals are Scheduled; Finals to be Held Simultaneously with the Women's Group

The final three games of the first volleyball league organized by the Volleyball Committee were held yesterday afternoon at the City Stadium.

### Using Yang Xiu's Name: Changfeng Team Sells Tickets in Hangzhou, China Youth Disagrees and Refunds Tickets

The China Youth Swimming Group of the Municipal Youth Association, at the invitation of the Hangzhou Changfeng Swimming Association, went to perform for the second time and agreed to bear the travel and accommodation expenses. The two parties agreed in advance not to sell tickets. However, after the China Youth arrived in Hangzhou, they learned that Changfeng was using Yang Xiuqiong's name to promote the event extensively and sold 4,000 tickets worth 2,000 yuan. The China Youth immediately expressed their disagreement. After discussion, in order to maintain their reputation, they decided to refund the tickets. The China Youth performed as usual. After the performance, the person in charge of Changfeng left without a trace, and all food and accommodation expenses were paid by the China Youth themselves. On the afternoon of the 8th, the China Youth's original plan to cross the river was also cancelled due to this incident. To save money, the China Youth took the midday express train back to Shanghai yesterday. Before leaving, Liang Zhaoan and others from the China Youth bid farewell to Yu Meisi, the general manager of Changfeng, and Qiu Yiyuan, the director of the Yuquan Swimming Pool, but they avoided meeting. They left a letter asking them to fulfill their promises and entrusted the Hangzhou Youth Association to handle the negotiations. The entire group then returned to Shanghai. Therefore, the group will participate in the swimming competition held at the Hongkou Swimming Pool today.

Mr. Jiang briefly stated: (1) Human rights are civil rights, which are the foundation of all democracy; (2) Education trains and establishes civil rights; (3) Senators should take striving for civil rights and training civil rights as the basic spirit for promoting education in the field of education; (4) The comprehensive development of education and the independence of educational funding, or increasing the current proportion, should be the goal to strive for; (5) Use educational organizations to exert educational power and complete the mission of education; (6) The current municipal senators should formulate policies and steps for the development of education in this city.

Finally, he was sent to the United States for investigation and entered Columbia University to specialize in education, obtaining a doctorate in education. He was invited to participate today, showing his concern for education, which is admirable.

### Nanjing Qiutan Scholarship Funds: 2 Million Yuan Allocated for Book Expenses

[Our Newspaper Nanjing News] The Nanjing Qiutan Scholarship Fund was established before the war and was relocated to Hankou during the Anti-Japanese War. After the victory and restoration, it returned to Nanjing and has already completed its first session. The second session is now being held after the summer vacation. The board of directors of the scholarship fund held a meeting in Beijing recently, with more than ten directors including Wu Zhongwen, Li Qingsong, Zheng Yanghe, Wang Chengzhang, and Chen Jingyu attending. It was decided that 2 million yuan would be allocated for this session as scholarship funds for university and middle school students. The number of university students is set at 50, limited to students with Nanjing registered residence in Nanjing and Shanghai, with each student receiving 12,000 yuan for book expenses. The number of middle school students, including senior and junior high school students, is 120 to 150, with each student receiving 6,000 to 8,000 yuan for book expenses, limited to students with Nanjing registered residence in Nanjing municipal and private well-known middle schools (such as Zhongying Middle School). The eligibility standards are based on students from poor families with excellent grades. The association's funds include real estate in Nanjing and Hankou, which is used to generate income and pay expenses. The current office is located at No. 252 Taiping Road, Nanjing.

### National Goods Market: Commission for Scholarships, Only 50 Million Earned Yesterday

The National Goods Market, sponsored by the Wooden Education Loan Committee, was announced to be closed on the 5th of this month. On the morning of the 8th, the domestic goods manufacturers participating in the First Market held a meeting. The results of the settlement showed that the total amount earned by each factory's self-sale in the market was 227,120,000 yuan, 2,539,240 yuan was earned from consignment sales, and 12,156,270 yuan was earned from charity sales by various schools, totaling 251,815,510 yuan.

Self-selling and consigning factories will extract 20% or 30% respectively and donate to the loan scholarship fund, which can raise more than 50 million yuan. In addition, the total turnover of the Second Market, which was hosted by Aurora University, was more than 12.7 million yuan in five days of operation, with a surplus of about 5 million yuan after deducting costs and expenses.

### China Medical College: Normal Enrollment and Classes

It is said that the China Medical College, founded by the famous Chinese medicine doctor Zhu Hegao, will not be banned by the Ministry of Education. It is now known that this is not the case. It is reported that the two Chinese medicine colleges in Shanghai and New China have been banned by the Ministry of Education. As for the China Medical College, it has not received any order from the Ministry, so the college is still continuing to enroll students and start classes as usual.

### Principal Dai of the Conservatory of Music Expresses: Will Expand Music Education

[Reported by this newspaper] The reporter visited Dai Cuilun, Principal of the National Conservatory of Music, yesterday. According to him, the school is preparing to resume classes under difficult conditions. The original Jiangwan campus of the school is being repaired. The school term will definitely use the original site as the campus, and the school will provide transportation for professors. As for the campus at No. 626 Aivenyi Road in this city, it will be allocated as faculty and staff dormitory. Since the school is a national institution, the tuition fees are limited, and the treatment of professors is relatively low, so it is quite difficult to hire professors, but the school is still trying its best to remedy the situation and hire famous Chinese and foreign musicians as professors. According to Dai, the school plans to establish a junior class and a symphony orchestra soon to expand the promotion of music education. The school currently owns more than 20 pianos, and there are still several grand pianos that have been ordered from abroad and will be shipped for use soon. When the reporter asked about the issue of jazz music, Dai replied: Even if it is jazz music, it must be played properly. The music in Shanghai dance halls today is played by performers with poor skills and the content is extremely mixed, which is the cause of the current phenomenon. In short, it is still necessary to comprehensively improve the general level of music, then there will be no room for the existence of overly low-level music.

### Wuhan Seven-Association Office Bans Pirated Textbooks: Elementary School Students Go to School But Don't Attend Classes

[Reported by this newspaper in Hankou] Although all public and private elementary schools in Wuhan held opening ceremonies on September 1, the date of formal classes is still nowhere in sight (7th). Elementary school students go to school but cannot "attend classes," which is very distressing. According to the heads of various schools, there are various difficult reasons for not being able to start classes immediately: (1) Many school sites have been borrowed by the army and cannot be vacated for a while. (2) The number of schools is too small, and there are too many out-of-school children. Every school is overcrowded, and the number of students introduced and requested from various parties exceeds more than twice the enrollment capacity. (3) The negotiation between the pirated textbook bookstores and the Seven-Association Supply Office to ban piracy has not yet been resolved, and they cannot be supplied on schedule. Even if one or two schools can start classes early, there is no book to read because the official national textbooks must be transported from Shanghai to Hankou. (4) It is also difficult to hire qualified and experienced teachers.

### Cigarette, Soap, Candle, and Match Industries Held a Symposium Yesterday

The Shanghai Cigarette, Soap, Candle, and Match Commercial Association held a symposium at the Atlantic Western Restaurant at 3:00 PM yesterday. Cigarette factory representatives were also invited to participate to strengthen communication. Pan Gongzhan, Speaker of the Municipal Council, Zhou Xuexiang, Chairman of the Federation of Trade Unions, Wang Zhuyi, representative of the Municipal Government, Zhou Lianze of the Municipal Party Department, Lu Keming, Municipal Councilor, and Chen Su of the Social Affairs Bureau were all invited to attend and give instructions. Weng Yanyou, the current chairman of the association, delivered a short opening speech, stating that the symposium aimed to establish close contact between the cigarette industry and the cigarette factories, so as to balance the production and sales of domestic cigarettes, maintain legitimate profits, and reverse the cigarette industry crisis. Xu Wenxiang, the standing supervisor of the association, then delivered a speech, saying that the association now has 4,324 member units, and dozens of them cannot safely pass the Mid-Autumn Festival due to market conditions. The reasons are: (1) heavy tax burdens and unstable finances, (2) foreign goods are flooding and dumping in the city, and (3) lack of communication between the cigarette industry and the cigarette factories. We must remove the above three evil causes before the cigarette industry can get on the right track. Pan Gongzhan then delivered a speech, saying that the cigarette industry and the cigarette factories are responsible for production and sales, respectively, and their interests are shared and closely related. No third party can participate, nor can any third party win them over. We hope that the two industries will cooperate and assist each other, understand each other, establish close contact, and jointly plan the balance of production and sales, and strive for the domestic cigarette industry. Representatives from various groups and organizations then delivered speeches in succession. Finally, Dai Gengxin, chairman of the Cigarette Factory Industry Association, delivered a thank-you speech. The meeting adjourned at 5:20 PM.

### De Fu Bu Neimen Distributes Goods: 14 Million Yuan for Shilin

Defu Foreign Firm has stopped allocating goods to various factories for nearly a month. It is reported that there is news of Shilin allocation recently, with the price being about 14 million yuan per 60 kilograms. The allocation price in the previous period was close to 10 million yuan, an increase of 40%, while the black market price exceeds 20 million yuan. As a result, the dyeing price of Indanthrene dyes has been adjusted by various dyeing factories to between 34,000 yuan and 36,000 yuan due to the sharp rise in raw materials. Bu Neimen Caustic Soda has been allocated to dyeing factories since last month at 160,000 per barrel. Before the exchange rate adjustment, there was an intention to allocate it to manufacturers at 260,000, but the company stopped allocating it due to exchange rate fluctuations. There is now talk of re-dispatching, with prices often above 400,000 yuan. It is reported that the order price in the United States has also increased to US$0.16 per pound, plus insurance and freight, it can be seen that the cost has increased. If Bu Neimen does not continue to allocate, the price may rise.

The transportation problem is still being resolved.

### Hardware Flows to Small Countries, Domestic Goods Rise Instead

In the hardware market, amid the influx of foreign goods, people's hearts have begun to weaken. Pipes, threaded rod, belt buckles, screws, abrasive cloth, etc., have all declined by about 10% last week.

### The Establishment of a Sound Securities Market

— Yang Yinpu

My country's capital is weak and its industry is backward. To this day, the company structure has not been universally adopted; basic enterprises have not seen large-scale development. On the one hand, raising funds and issuing shares is deeply difficult; on the other hand, scattered funds flood the market. Although the causes of this contradictory phenomenon are not one-sided, the lack of a sound securities market, which leads to the stagnation and dysfunction of long-term funds, is undoubtedly one of its main reasons. In view of this, the Executive Yuan issued an instruction in May to actively organize the Shanghai securities market. At that time, Du Yuesheng was designated as the chairman of the preparatory committee, Wang Zhixin as the vice chairman, and Xu Jilong, Qian Xinzhi, Yu Huancheng and other seven people as members. After the establishment of the preparatory committee, it actively carried out preparatory work. For example, drafting company articles of association and various rules and regulations, reviewing the qualifications of brokers, reviewing listed securities, repairing the market, and arranging personnel have all been completed. After three months, it officially opened today. The foundation of the capital market can be said to be a grand event that can be recorded in the financial history of our country.

(1) Characteristics of the Newly Established Institution

The "Shanghai Stock Exchange", which was completed this time, inherited the foundation of the "Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange" before the war, and can be traced back to the "Shanghai Stock Commercial Association" and the securities industry's "tea party" in the early years of the Republic of China. On the one hand, it accepts the old system, and on the other hand, it creates a sound new system. There are three points that can be mentioned for its characteristics: First, complete the unified organization; second, establish an expanded foundation; third, determine the nature of the market.

A. Completing the Unified Organization. The existence of a securities market in Shanghai did not begin today; however, the existence of a unified and centralized securities market in Shanghai can be said to have begun with the "Shanghai Stock Exchange" established today. During the era when the securities section of the "Shanghai Securities and Goods Exchange" existed, there were three securities markets coexisting in Shanghai; after the securities section of the "Shanghai Securities and Goods Exchange" was merged, under the situation where the "Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange" and the Western "Shanghai Zhongye Gongsuo" stood side by side, the securities markets coexisting in Shanghai were still more than two. The newly established institution this time, on the one hand, inherits the system of the "Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange," and on the other hand, incorporates the business of the Western "Shanghai Zhongye Gongsuo," creating an unprecedented unified situation with Shanghai's only market. This is its first characteristic.

B. Establishing an Expanded Foundation. Before the war, the original securities market, on the Chinese side, centered on the domestic association; on the Western side, it centered on foreign business associations. The foundations were biased, and the business became fragmented. The newly established institution this time, in terms of the organization of the exchange itself, in addition to the old shareholders, added the investment of the state's five banks, which is one aspect of the foundation's expansion. Furthermore, in terms of the scope of approved brokers, in addition to including the old domestic "association" peers and Western "Zhongye" members, it also includes legal entity brokers from silver, money, and trust companies, as well as other individual brokers who have engaged in or managed securities investment business and meet the prescribed qualifications. This is another aspect of the foundation's expansion. Encompassing multiple aspects and blending into one, the foundation is expanded, and strength increases accordingly. This is its second characteristic.

C. Determining the Nature of the Market. The securities traded in the Chinese market before the war were all government bonds, and their function was limited to the adjustment of fiscal surpluses and deficits. Strictly speaking, it can only be regarded as a "financial market." The securities listed in the Western market before the war were all foreign stocks, and their function was limited to the vitality of foreign capital. Strictly speaking, it can only be regarded as a "foreign capital market." One focused on finance, and the other focused on foreign business. There was no connection with the capital required by large-scale enterprises, and neither could truly be called a long-term capital market or a capital market. The business scope of the newly established market this time takes the stocks and bonds issued by domestic enterprises as its center, while also including government-issued public bonds and securities issued by foreign businesses in China. While encompassing and including everything, it differentiates between importance and weight. The nature of the capital market is ultimately determined. This is its third characteristic.

(2) The Functions That a Securities Market Should Have

If industry is to develop rationally, adequate and usable funds are undoubtedly one of its most important conditions. "Adequate and usable" means that the time when these funds can be used must match the actual time needed for the industry to turn over. The funds required for industrial equipment are generally longer-term and larger in amount. Because of the large amount, it is necessary to find ways to open up multiple avenues for absorption; because of the long term, it is necessary to find ways to enhance the liquidity of funds. It seems that there is no better way than to "securitize" them.

The slogan of "securitizing long-term funds" was advocated by enlightened people in the 23rd year of the Republic of China. And the most important key to "securitizing long-term funds" lies in the establishment of a sound securities market. The most important functions of the securities market in this regard can be listed in three aspects: First, enhance the liquidity of funds; second, expand the base of fund sources; third, indicate effective avenues for investment.

A. Enhancing the Liquidity of Funds. Funds in the form of securities become instruments that can be circulated; securities with a market for buying and selling gain a path for circulation. Long-term investments are feared to be stagnant, and worried that they cannot be sold when they want to be realized. In other words, they are most likely to lack liquidity. Now, if they are given the form of securities and a market for buying and selling is established, they can be sold at any time, that is, the funds invested can be recovered at any time. From then on, although the form is a long-term investment, it actually contains a short-term effect, and its activity can be greatly enhanced. At the same time, securities with this high degree of activity will surely become a good collateral target in the financial community. Therefore, although this investment is long-term, it can be realized immediately by selling it; it can be used for loans immediately. There is no fear of stagnation, and no fear that it cannot be sold. This is because of the existence of a securities market, which enhances the liquidity of funds. This is its first function.

### Pulp Rises by 10%

[United Press Washington, 7th] The Price Administration Bureau announced that the price of domestic and imported wood pulp will increase by approximately 10%, which is estimated to increase the annual cost of paper mills using wood pulp by 25 million yuan.

### Factory Managers Circle: Artificial Silk Rises by 500,000, Silk Goods Rise with Raw Materials

The price of rayon on Monday and Tuesday of last week was 2,256,000 yuan, which was quite stable. Starting from the next day, actual sales were active, and it rose by more than 100,000 yuan. On Thursday, Zhongfang Company stopped allocating, which greatly stimulated people's hearts, and taking advantage of the opportunity that No. 120 glossy was out of stock, the black market frantically raised prices. The price soared by more than 200,000 yuan on that day, and it rose by another 150,000 yuan on the weekend. In total, it rose by a huge amount of 500,000 yuan in a week. Miscellaneous glossy and semi-glossy also followed suit, rising by 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. No. 150 glossy was even more expensive than No. 120, rising by more than 600,000 yuan. Transactions between factory managers and foreign firms were limited, and the money supply was very tight, so the price could not rise. The domestic market hovered up and down last week, with only a difference of 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. The price on the weekend was similar to that on Monday. Sales of silk goods gradually improved, and due to the high cost of raw materials, the prices of all goods increased uniformly, increasing by about 10% in seven weeks. However, compared with raw materials, it is still inadequate. According to various manufacturers, if the raw materials cannot be lowered, the cost of silk goods is crucial and must be increased.

Production Construction

### A Year of Victory

— Editor

A year has passed in the blink of an eye since the victory. In this year, when one wants to talk about production and construction, it is truly something that evokes many feelings. Due to various reasons, most production endeavors are struggling amidst difficulties, with very little success.

In reality, during the war of resistance, due to the lack of resources and the devaluation of currency, factories were merely increasing figures on paper every day, without being able to attend to, or even needing to attend to, work efficiency and other matters. Therefore, it can be said that no preparations were made for the efforts needed by the post-war construction class.

After the victory, many situations did not live up to expectations, resulting in numerous difficulties and a feeling of being overwhelmed. Unlike the industries of countries like England and the United States, which were spurred to increase production during the war and were able to quickly return to normal production after peace,

A year of precious time has passed, but we must not let the lack of achievement diminish our spirit of progress. Many years lie ahead, waiting for us to strive forward.

To put it more practically, let us quickly formulate a plan for the coming year.

### Impressions of British and American Industries

— Translated by Deng Shaoqiu from "Far Eastern Economist" No. 12

(1) Travel Impressions

I remember a long time ago (1930 and 1933) I visited England twice, and last year (1944) I also visited the United States. Although these three trips were very short, they left me with many impressions. This year, I was fortunate enough to visit England again and also made two very satisfying and pleasant trips to the United States, gaining many new insights worth reporting to the readers. Here are some insights regarding the industries of England and the United States, which can also serve as a reference for many worldwide industrial improvements.

(2) British Industry

My trip to England took place during the five months shortly after the end of the war against Germany and before the victory over Japan. At that time, British industry was in the process of transitioning from wartime to peacetime production. Therefore, the many cotton yarn weaving factories in England had been converted to produce munitions and weapons, as were other bicycle and automobile factories. Of course, returning to the original state not only requires money but also more time and manpower. However, British industry recovered faster than people expected.

Working conditions in British factories have greatly improved, also due to the needs of the war. The factory workplaces are well-arranged, clean, and bright, and the seats are quite comfortable. Furthermore, wireless radios are installed in the workplaces, allowing workers to listen to harmonious music while they work. Therefore, the work efficiency of British workers is very high. For example, in cotton yarn production, a female worker can manage six machines with two hundred and twenty to three hundred yarn spindles, whereas in India, they only manage two. Therefore, one difference between British industry and that of other countries is its high work efficiency.

Furthermore, the war has been very beneficial to British industry. Many factories have installed the most advanced new machinery and equipment due to the urgent needs of the war. At the same time, government funding, internal expansion, and the establishment of many new factories in the past five years have naturally led to high efficiency in these factories, thereby promoting the development of British peacetime industry. However, some factories expanded their scale in a hurry for urgent needs, and the equipment is incomplete. Some factories also lack capital, making it impossible to compete with highly efficient factories, and they face the risk of closure over time.

(3) American Industry

If we only consider work efficiency, American industry is even better than British industry. Although British work efficiency is already much higher than that of other countries, American factories have even more complete equipment, and workers generally use and cherish their machines. Furthermore, American workers do not demand increased wages due to the factory's mass production, nor do they worry that increased production will lead to unemployment.

Americans are excellent at organization. They have plans for everything. For example, factory managers strive to help workers. However, the British believe that American workers lack creativity, and the work efficiency of American senior workers is not higher than that of the British. However, it must be understood that 99% of American workers have a spirit of enterprise, which is an undeniable contribution.

Furthermore, all working conditions in America are better than those in England, and wages are also higher. American workers receive two dollars in wages, while British workers only receive one dollar. Moreover, American workers can often receive material rations. This is because the unit production cost in the United States is lower than that in England, and it adopts large-scale production, while England adopts division of labor production. Therefore, the standard of living for American workers is higher than that for British workers, and higher than the standard of living for workers in all countries in the world.

Between 1939 and 1944, the United States government spent 40 billion US dollars on equipping industries, adding equipment, and changing plans. They are confident that they can compete with any country and are preparing to increase exports by 50%. Fortunately, the American government and industrialists have also seen the necessity of industrial construction.

(4) Research in the Industries of the Two Countries

Finally, speaking of industrial research in England and the United States, it has naturally achieved great success. The I.C.I. factory in England employs 1,500 chemists to conduct experimental analysis and research. American factories are also willing to spend millions of US dollars on research work, and after the war, the number of researchers and research funding are increasing linearly.

Naturally, everyone knows that post-war global economic competition will be more intense than during and before the war. If a country does not want to occupy a leading position internationally, then industrially backward countries must quickly rise and strive forward, or they will be dominated by others. Improving work efficiency and strengthening industrial research are the most organized and planned industrial construction.

### Dr. Yang Shuxun Talks About the Future of China's Pharmaceutical Industry

— Fei Wen

Research is more important than sales; the future is quite bright

Dr. Yang Shuxun, the head of the Yang's Chemotherapeutic Institute, obtained a PhD in chemistry from the University of Chicago in the United States. After graduation, he was hired as a researcher by the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, specializing in research work. Peking Union Medical College had already requested that he return to China to serve, and he was eventually hired as a researcher by the Academia Sinica.

He has always focused on research work because he believes that a pharmaceutical business cannot be without research facilities. Even the success or failure of a factory can be determined by the condition of its research laboratory. Without a research laboratory, it is like having no master.

He believes that after this victory, many imported medicines can be researched, manufactured, and replaced. When he first manufactured "New Xihua Powder," he conducted market research. At that time, Bayer's Salvarsan had an annual turnover of one million yuan in China, and French 914 had an annual turnover of three to four hundred thousand yuan. Japanese medicines also had two to three hundred thousand yuan. Later, when "New Xihua Powder" was released, it did have a significant impact on them.

Therefore, Yang Chuanshi then invented "Insulin" and other effective drugs, and even the recent "Xiaofaping Pain Reliever" can replace imported products.

Previously, when Dr. Yang was employed at the Academia Sinica, he drafted a plan for government-people cooperation, which was to establish a pharmaceutical department within the Academia Sinica, specializing in research work. The research results and the manufacturing plan for a certain drug would be handed over to private pharmaceutical factories, and the Academia Sinica would extract a prescribed commission from the turnover. In this way, the Academia Sinica could have an income to maintain research work, and private pharmaceutical factories could also obtain new pharmaceutical plans at any time. Unfortunately, it only lasted for half a year before it was virtually suspended due to the outbreak of war.

According to Dr. Yang's vision, the future of China's pharmaceutical industry is quite bright, as long as it focuses on research work.

### A Tour of Jiale Paper Mill

— Song Cheng

In our country where all production undertakings are backward, the paper industry is no exception. Therefore, before the War of Resistance, most of the paper had to be imported from abroad—especially from Sichuan. It was not until 1928 that Mr. Li Jieren returned from studying in France and established a noteworthy production organization in a little-known corner of western Sichuan, which was the birthplace of Jiale Paper—the Jiale Paper Mill. It is said that Mr. Li's establishment of the Jiale Paper Mill was initially just a trial, a gamble, because he wanted to use the more than 100,000 dan of rice straw produced annually in Leshan (also known as Jiading, located at the confluence of the Minjiang and Qingyi Rivers) to make paper. As a result, he finally succeeded in the experiment, and "Jiale Paper" began to meet the Chinese people. However, although the paper was made, the sales became a problem—either heavily discounted or ignored. At that time, Mr. Li Jieren tried to solve the sales problem by opening the "Li Bao Guan" in Chengdu, and all the paper needed daily was Jiale Paper. In this way, although Jiale Paper had a way out, it affected the sales of the newspaper—because competing with newspapers printed on newsprint was undoubtedly. But Mr. Li did not lose heart and continued to persevere according to his plan and hope.

After the start of the War of Resistance, traffic was blocked accordingly. Those who could use imported paper before the war also had to use Jiale Paper instead. Therefore, during the War of Resistance, Mr. Li finally established a strong throne in the rearguard of the paper industry, and the name "Jiale Paper" was well known in the rear. Before the victory, the Jiale Paper Mill's Jiale Paper was all sold or distributed to various institutions and organizations by the Economic Control Bureau, so sales spread to major cities in the rear, such as Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, and Xi'an, where it had offices.

Jiale Paper Mill is located outside Jialemen, Leshan, western Sichuan. The author recently visited the factory with a pleasant mood. According to Mr. Cao Jianjun, the business director of the factory, the total area of the factory is 39 mu. When the author visited, the "squeak, squeak, squeak..." of the machines broke the surrounding silence. They now have three paper machines, one of which was allocated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs last year, and one was purchased when the factory was opened. It is now old and its efficiency has been greatly reduced, so it is not often used. The other was added in 1941 and is the most heavily used machine. The raw material for making Jiale Paper is rice straw, which the factory needs 450,000 to 500,000 jin per month. When making paper, the rice straw and other materials are first put into a cooking sphere, and then chemicals such as caustic soda are added, and steam is added to steam it to 80 pounds. When the raw materials in the cooking sphere are cooked, they are taken out and put into a pulping machine, and beaten until the fiber is extremely fine, and then enter the pulp storage pool to add "filler". The pulp flows from the pulp storage pool through the adjuster into the settling basin, settling out the fine sand and debris in the pulp, and then enters the paper machine, first passing through a round net made of copper wire cloth inside the paper machine, which carries it out and applies it to the felt roller of the paper machine, and then the felt belt enters the press to absorb the most water and make the pulp tightly rolled and ironed, and then the felt belt is brought to the drying cylinder. The drying cylinder is a smooth roller made of a round steel plate, and high-temperature hot steam is passed in. The pulp is completely dried by the high heat of the drying cylinder. Jiale Paper rotates on another rolling shaft. It is reported that the entire process from rice straw to Jiale Paper only takes eight hours. If cotton, rags and hemp textiles are used instead of rice straw, white Daolin paper can be made. Because the factory has problems with the cost and sales of Daolin paper, it still manufactures Jiale Paper to supply to users in the mainland. However, it was recently heard that the factory will cooperate with Yongli Chemical Industry Co. to prepare to build a larger paper mill near Dongchuan. Hopefully this is a fact, and the paper industry in Sichuan will undoubtedly become more developed and sound.

The current director of the Jiale Paper Mill in Leshan is Mr. Chen Xiaolan, and there are more than 400 employees. Most of the workers have a deep relationship with the factory, so labor and management are quite harmonious. A three-shift rotation system is adopted, with eight hours per shift. The factory has employee consumer cooperatives, barber shops, medical offices and other facilities, specializing in serving the workers who sweat for the production cause.

### An Outline of Business Management

— Xu Baiyi

D. Supervision of Work

In the progress of manufacturing work, constant supervision is required. This supervision work can be divided into two types:

A. Supervision during the work progress,

B. Inspection of the product manufacturing process,

The first type of work is easy to understand. For example, if we build a house, we must hire a supervisor to monitor the progress of the work. His responsibility is to prevent the workers from being lazy and the construction company from cutting corners.

Regarding this aspect, there can be two methods:

The first method is to use our eyes to do the monitoring work. The foreman in the manufacturing plant is the person responsible for this type of work. He must see whether the workers are lazy during working hours, or whether the work meets the standards. If he discovers something, he should immediately correct it so that it does not continue to go wrong. The second method is to use the recording method. For example, for attendance, each worker has a card, and when going to work, he punches the clock to record the time, and the same is true when leaving work. Also, there are records of the work produced every day. This method not only allows the director of a department to see the workers' achievements, but through statistical work, the authorities of a company can also see the progress of the factory. For example, if we run a farm with tens of thousands of cattle, then each cow has a number, and there can be a statistic of how much milk it produces every day. The owner of a milk company can know everything about the cattle without entering the cattle farm—their production, their health, their consumption.

In fact, it is not possible for a company director to go around inspecting all day long, so the method of recording and statistics is the most able to supply his needs.

Usually, the above two types of work are carried out simultaneously.

Regarding the inspection of goods, then the impact on the future of the goods is very large, and it must be handled seriously. I have visited the General Electric Edison Bulb Factory. Every step of their manufacturing process has to be inspected. Before being packaged and shipped, several pieces have to be sampled and inspected to see if they meet the standards. Another example is pharmaceutical factories. Medicines also have to undergo many inspections before being shipped. In order to be cautious and clarify responsibilities, many pharmaceutical factories require all the people responsible for the inspection to sign and stamp a slip of paper attached to the medicine box, especially when manufacturing drugs for injection.

In terms of editing and publishing books, proofreading is also a kind of inspection work—checking for errors. The Commercial Press and other bookstores once attached the names of the proofreaders to the copyright page for a time. This action also meant being cautious.

Commentary

### Commemorating the 99th Anniversary of the Victory: Respectfully Console Writers Nationwide

Today marks the full first anniversary of the 9/9 Victory and Surrender.

Before this year, writers in the literary and art circles, whether in the front lines, the rear, behind enemy lines, or overseas, had contributed our energy and youth to the best of our ability, and had fulfilled our due responsibilities, with our only pen in pursuit of a single goal. We shouted, we fought, we endured, we persevered, we suffered hardships and torments, yet we finally won!

Although the pen is not a gun, paper bullets sometimes outweigh artillery shells. In these years, there were inevitably some sediments that rose with the flood of war and betrayed the anti-Japanese camp. However, the wheels of time have long discarded the sediments in literary and art circles. Furthermore, many loyal and brave writers unfortunately became disabled, lost their health, or even quietly passed away after fulfilling their responsibilities.

Now that we stand before the victory monument, we can be comforted and proud. We can be worthy of our ancestors and worthy of our descendants.

In this past year, writers have successively returned to their original posts. However, due to the shortcomings of transportation and transportation management, some writers are still in the rear even today. Many writers have returned to the capital after a difficult journey, which is equivalent to escaping another disaster. When we recall our wartime life, who can blame writers for not producing great works?

Originally, the hardships after the war were expected. Now that this difficult first year has passed, the remaining limited hardships are awaiting great human power to overcome. Writers, the human spirit technicians, standing on the front lines of the literary and art cause, are of course unwilling to give up this re-emerging era's task of guiding society and encouraging the people to move towards lasting peace and a bright world!

Today, as we look back on the past and look forward to the future, we are even more mindful of the many friends who are struggling for food, family burdens, transportation for returning to their original posts, or housing and occupations after returning, as well as the lives of the families of the martyred friends, and we feel even more emotional! However, even with thousands of words, there is nothing to say.

Here, with warmth and sincerity, we respectfully extend our condolences and blessings for the victory! (Editor)

### Love and Death

— By Guy de Maupassant, Translated by Shi Xinghuo

In this cemetery, officers stood as thickly as a field in full bloom. French-style kepis and red trousers, stripes and gold buttons, staff epaulettes, guards and cavalry ribbons... moving back and forth between the graves, the crosses on the graves, extending their arms of mourning towards the departed.

Colonel Raymond's wife had just been buried, having drowned while swimming two days prior. The funeral was over, and the priests had left. The colonel, supported by two colleagues, still stood before the grave. At the bottom of the pit, he could still see the oak coffin containing his young wife.

He was a tall, thin old man with short, white hair. Three years prior, he had married the daughter left behind by his deceased comrade, Colonel Sottis.

The commander and adjutant urged him to return, but he resisted, forcefully holding back the tears welling up in his eyes, and whispered, "No, no! Wait a little longer!" He stubbornly refused to leave, kneeling by the graveside, gazing into the bottomless abyss, in which lay buried his heart, his life, and all that he loved.

Suddenly, General Hamont seized Raymond's arm, almost forcibly dragging him away, saying, "Come, come! Old friend! Let's go!"

And so, the colonel obeyed and returned to headquarters. When he opened the door to his study and picked up a letter from the desk, he was almost startled and moved to collapse. He recognized his wife's handwriting. The postmark and date on the letter were the same. He hurriedly tore open the envelope and read:

"Papa! Allow me to call you Papa once more, as in days gone by; when you find this letter, I will surely be dead and already buried, therefore, perhaps you will forgive me.

"I do not wish to arouse your pity, nor do I wish to lessen my sin, I only wish to tell you the whole truth, with the sincere heart of a woman who is about to commit suicide within an hour.

"When you generously united with me, I gave myself to you out of gratitude. I loved you with all my girlish heart, I loved you just as I loved my own father—simply and completely the same; remember one day, when I was sitting on your knee and you kissed me, I involuntarily called you 'Papa,' this cry came entirely from the heart, entirely from instinct, truly, you were a father to me, and nothing else. At the time, you smiled at me and said, 'Call me that then, my child, it makes me even happier'.

"We arrived in the city, — forgive me, Papa— I fell into a love affair, oh! I resisted external temptation for a long time, nearly two years, but later, I succumbed, I sinned, I was to become a fallen woman.

"As for him, you will never guess who he is, in any case, I am easily satisfied, because a dozen officers often surrounded me, what you called the twelve satellite group.

"Papa, do not seek him out, nor hate him, he only did what any man would do, and I believe he loved me wholeheartedly too.

"One day, we had an appointment, on a small island called Bissycke, near the mill, I had to swim over, he was waiting for me in the woods, when I just caught a glimpse of him through the branches, we saw your orderly, Philippe, which startled us greatly, then, he—my lover—said to me: 'Go, hurry back, my love, leave me and this man here!'

I swam back so hastily that I almost drowned, when I came back, I sensed that something terrible would happen.

"An hour later, Philippe met me in the corridor and said in a low voice, 'I am at madam's command, if there is any letter to be taken,' then, I knew that he had been bought off by my lover.

"I gave him a few letters, he took them away, and brought back replies.

"Two months passed like this, and we trusted him as much as we trusted you.

"But, Papa, things finally happened: one day, on the same small island, I found your orderly, he was waiting for me, he told me that if I did not grant his request, he would report everything to you.

"Ah, Papa! Papa! Terror and cowardice conquered me, I thought: you have treated me so well, and I have betrayed you, I also thought of him, afraid that you would kill him, and kill me too, I was mad, I thought to buy off the hateful fellow once more—how shameful!

"We women are so weak, we can easily lose our minds. When a woman falls once, she will continue to fall, all the way to the bottom. I don't know why I did it, just thinking that one of you two and myself would die—so, I gave myself to that beast.

"You know, Papa! I will not forgive myself, what happened later is imaginable, he would use threats, again and again, to possess me, how hateful it is! How severe is this punishment, Papa?

"Thinking like this, everything is over, I must die, when I am alive, I cannot repent to you, dead, I have the courage to confess everything, except death, I cannot use any other method to cleanse myself, I am too disgraced, I can no longer love nor deserve to be loved, everything I touch seems to be disgraced.

"At this moment, I am going to take a bath, and never come back, this letter will be forwarded to you by my lover, carrying my last prayers, you will read her, when you come back from the cemetery.

"Goodbye, Dad! I have nothing else to tell you, do whatever you want, just forgive me!"

The colonel wiped the sweat from his forehead, recovering the calm he had on the battlefield, he pressed the bell.

A servant walked in.

"Call Philippe!" the colonel said, opening a drawer.

The man immediately came in—a tall soldier, with a red mustache, a pair of cunning hawk eyes, giving an ominous gaze.

The colonel stared straight at his face.

"Tell me quickly, my wife's lover's name!"

"But, Colonel—"

The officer grabbed the pistol from the half-open drawer.

"Come on, quickly, I'm not joking with you!"

"Alright, — my Colonel— it's Commander Saint, Albert."

Before the name was finished, a flash of fire shone between his eyes, his forehead had been pierced by a bullet.

### Arthur Schnitzler

— Xi Shou

Arthur Schnitzler was born on May 15, 1862, in Vienna. He was the son of a throat doctor, with Jewish ancestry. In 1885, he graduated from the University of Vienna, earning a doctorate in medicine. He interned at the university hospital for two or three years. After leaving the hospital, he began practicing medicine, continuing for about ten years. During his medical practice, he often wrote novels and plays. Later, he abandoned his medical career and devoted himself to writing. He died of heart disease on October 21, 1931.

What first made him famous in the literary world were the three plays, Anatole, Flirtation (Liebelei), and La Ronde (Der Reigen). All three depict the lives of the upper class in Vienna. Schnitzler's works mainly draw on themes from contemporary Viennese society, especially those he found in his own environment. The protagonists are either himself or the literati around him, a group of detached melancholics. Almost all of his works are like this: a lover and one or two women. His depictions of their love affairs have an elegant charm, and his descriptions of each character have a sense of identity. Whether in drama or novel, he meticulously analyzes psychology with a scientific attitude and gentlemanly elegance, regardless of whether he is depicting an officer, doctor, musician, village girl, or widow. Schnitzler's view of life contains terror and doubt about the unfathomable nature of fate. He believes that life in this world is a frivolous game. Throughout life, one can experience intense moments of pleasure, but ultimately it is light joy and thin sorrow. Therefore, the keynote of his works is nothing more than love and death, two things. He uses melancholy, hazy emotions to depict this drama of life.

Although Schnitzler belongs to the Neo-Romantic school, he has gradually expanded the art of this school to realism; this is because he has a scientific mind that is close to the real world. His art is as superb as that of Hugo von Hofmannsthal. Especially in the refinement and purification of technique, he closely resembles great French writers. However, his works are universal and can be appreciated by the general public and the art world alike. This is where he differs from other Neo-Romantic writers, and it is also where his greatness lies.

The spirit of Schnitzler's plays is completely different from that of Sudermann and Hauptmann; although he does not have Hauptmann's strength, he possesses elegance, refinement, and gentleness. Also, his satire is reminiscent of Chekhov, who was a doctor. His best plays combine honesty and a mournful elegy-like sorrow with the seductive power of the spirit. His novels, in fact, can be described in the same way, written in a musical style with a fluent pen. He skillfully expresses these minimal facts without being repetitive or tedious. Like a master pianist, although there are only a few strings, through his plucking, he produces piano sounds of varying pitches and inflections, with endless variations. This superb artistic technique is truly admirable.

### An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng 27

"I remembered one thing, the Japanese devils' 'disappearance' was a ridiculous performance, but it was just right, how..."

"How did they disappear and then return to the team... and immediately spread the news?" I picked up on his question about the July 7th Incident, the disappearance and sudden return of soldiers, "From this point, you can see how hard and efficiently Tsurumi worked—of course, we had intelligence beforehand, there were two of our team members tailing that missing little devil, do you know where he was planning to go?...

"...Mr. W couldn't help but laugh when he saw me, and shook his head and laughed too.

"Not far from Fengtai, to a seedy brothel, and he even brought a big bottle of genuine wine for reward..."

"Bastard,... as long as they just brazenly claim that one or two soldiers are missing, who would care? Why necessarily put on a real performance?" Mr. W shook his head, while gnashing his teeth and wanting to scold, but he restrained himself from scolding.

"Little devils are just little devils, where else in the world can you find stupider 'pigs'?"... I said what Mr. W wanted to say. "Later, our team members caught that guy, and forced him to make three or four phone calls to several Sino-Japanese agencies—a very immoral arrangement—otherwise, even if they forced him back to the team, the little devil would deny everything, for sure!"

"Right?" Mr. W said bitterly, "Even so, they finally managed to burst the little devils' oriental bubble, but he still had to proceed with 'tough smoothness.'" These four words, "tough smoothness," were the terms used in Bái Kòu's secret orders, which was the intelligence we relayed to Mr. W's Beijing Station a few days ago.

The security within Beijing City was supposedly controlled by our guard team, although the Japanese claws; such as Korean thugs, ruffians, and down-and-out bandits, were somewhat baring their teeth, and restless, but they were only doing sneaky mischief like urban foxes and shrine rats.

Our car reached its destination safely—the Beijing Hotel.

"Old Uncle is here?" Little Tiger greeted us, and bowed deeply to Mr. W, then turned to lead the way.

"Auntie Ji," Little Tiger opened the door and said to the room, "Two... one is Old Uncle, one is... is..." He couldn't address him.

"Miss Ji, I'm very sorry..." I stepped into the room to apologize.

"Please sit down, gentlemen." The Northeast Miss was very generous and frank.

I admired Tsurumi's insight. She was indeed an outstanding talent—in my view. I remembered a philosopher who wrote these two sentences: "Your eyes reveal your spirit, your words represent your thoughts, your actions illustrate your character, your spirit expresses your aptitude, and your demeanor reveals your knowledge..." It was probably the sum total expression of these qualities that explained why she was an outstanding talent.

At the same time, I also understood why Tsurumi didn't want to see her, that is to say, as long as Tsurumi wasn't a hypocritical moralist. Like most sharp-eyed young men, seeing a miss like that, he would probably take winning her love as the greatest cause of his life; because she certainly had a kind of aggressive heroic spirit, but also a kind of charm that made people fall in love unknowingly, it wasn't a matter of beauty or ugliness.

### The Rong Case Loot

— Shao Fu

The Rong family has already sent someone to retrieve the loot recovered from the kidnappers. The actual amounts are as follows:

USD 94,745

CNY 102,715,200

Gold 332 taels, 9 mace, 2 fen, 8 li

The USD, converted to CNY at a rate of 3350, is equivalent to CNY 317,339,575. The gold, converted to CNY at a rate of CNY 221,000 per tael, is equivalent to CNY 73,577,088. The total amount is over CNY 490 million.

Even so, the amount is considerable.

Regarding the disposition of this money, some advocate allocating it to the police welfare fund, others advocate using it to relieve the refugees in Northern Jiangsu, and we have also advocated establishing the "Desheng Scholarship Fund" to support out-of-school youths; but to date, Mr. Rong Desheng himself, or the Rong family, has not made a clear and concrete statement, which is truly a matter of concern!

It is not that these people are greedy for money, unable to bear the sight of this money. To be honest, there are many wealthy people in Shanghai, and the Rong family is not the foremost. However, given the current circumstances, whoever puts forward a proposal is doing so for the public good and for Mr. Rong's sake.

Money is a good thing. It can benefit people, but it can also harm people. The question is how it is used. Those who have read the autobiography of Rockefeller (the oil tycoon) can appreciate his saying that "having too much money is a trouble." Perhaps some people even think that he hired a group of experts to organize a foundation and spend all day researching how to use money, as if he was crazy! However, we have to admit that his two sentences are truth:

"God gave me so much money, just to let me make good use of it."

### Sweet Sleep

— Ganlai

On the eve of Journalists' Day, Director Zhang of the Municipal Health Bureau attended a journalists' dinner party. Mr. Zhang, in his capacity as a hygiene scholar, advised reporters to take a nap every day to refresh their spirits. This shows the importance of sleep for human health.

Sleep is a physiological requirement. Daily physical exertion and mental fatigue must be compensated and restored by sleep. Generally speaking, the higher the animal, the more sleep it needs per day; animals below mammals not only have less sleep time, but also have no fixed time for waking, sleeping, moving, or stillness.

Habitually speaking, humans need an average of eight hours of sleep per day, but according to experiments conducted successively by German scholars and professors at the University of Chicago, eight hours of sleep is a waste of time. It turns out that sleep is "quality over quantity," and eight hours of "light sleep" is not as good as six hours of "sound sleep."

There was an old baker in Ireland who passed away in 1936. During his lifetime, he developed a habit: he started baking bread at 8:00 PM and continued until 5:00 or 6:00 AM the next morning. When the sun came out, he would go hunting in the mountains. At one point, he averaged only seven or eight hours of sleep per week, but his body was not affected at all.

Apes and monkeys sleep as much as humans every day, but elephants only need three or four hours of sleep per day.

When sleeping, the brain's activity decreases, and the body's blood concentrates in the heart, stomach, and intestines, which can improve the function of the digestive organs, so napping is most needed in the summer. Currently, the armies and public institutions of various civilized countries are sure to implement group naps in the summer.

Director Zhang's suggestion to take a nap after meals is indeed worth promoting.

Occasional Musings

### Beard

— Xu Hongfu

Talking about beards is enough to show the national character of a country. Although Europeans and Americans are nearly sixty years old, the lower half of their faces is always a barren land. They are forever young. Indians are not yet adults, and their curly beards are already like snails, darkening half of their faces. This fully expresses their seniority.

Beards are enough to make one famous and protect oneself. Dr. Mei Lanfang, who is famous far and wide, grew a mustache to show his determination to refuse to perform for the enemy and puppets, which won the approval of the whole country. "Who says artists have no backbone!" His fame became even greater. Cao Cao of the Three Kingdoms, when being pursued by Ma Chao, had to occasionally come up with the quick wit of cutting his robe and beard in desperation, otherwise he would have died under the knife long ago, wouldn't he?

Beards fully express the contradictions in people's hearts. Children see themselves in the mirror, and when they don't have a tuft of black hair growing under their nostrils like their fathers, they will use a brush dipped in ink to paint two strokes, in order to brag in front of their little friends. When they reach the age when beards grow, they will find it annoying again, and they will not be afraid of bleeding pain, and they will take tweezers and painstakingly pull them out from the roots, flesh and all.

Beards occupy a very important position in cartoons. A small mustache above the lips, we can guess, is either the comedian Charlie Chaplin or the dictator Hitler. The upward-curving figure-eight mustache of the Jintan brand is undoubtedly a senior Japanese military and political figure. As for Gorky's and Stalin's Russian-style beards, they are even easier to recognize. They are like two brooms without handles, hanging below the high nasal bridge.

Beards have been used as bets. Last year in Myanmar, American team members of the 14th Air Force vowed not to shave their beards until the mission was completed. This is comparable to "Exterminate the Xiongnu, then have breakfast."

Like other physiological characteristics, beards can give people nicknames. For example, Tian Xiushan, the Tiger of Eastern Zhejiang, is called Tian Bearded. Wang "Lài" Beard in The True Story of Ah Q is also because he has a loose beard.

At 3:00 PM on the 4th of this month, our school invited Professor Pei Fei from Columbia University in the United States to give a speech at our school for the first time. Amidst our warm applause, he appeared before us and began his speech; in his speech, he first said: "In the past, foreigners often criticized that the thoughts and actions of the Chinese people would never change, but now they see that everything about the Chinese people has changed, and they have made much more progress than before, but there are still two things that have not changed. The first thing that has not changed is that the Chinese people are always so polite to foreigners, which makes us feel too polite. The second thing that has not changed is that the Chinese people always like to listen to the advice and criticism of foreigners..."

When we heard this, it seemed to be just a cameo joke in his speech, but if we savor this passage of words carefully, we have endless thoughts!

### Low Key

Nanjing Road, a woman in the red dust.

Nanjing Road is like a woman in the red dust. Before the war, she was still a "fair-skinned and tender" good woman, but after eight years of being ravaged, she became "thin and bony" and lost all her charm. Unexpectedly, in the past year, she has become even weaker and more out of tune, and to this day, she has become "full of holes," leaving only a "skeleton."

Opening the newspaper and taking a look, there are cases of corruption every day. If cut out, day after day, one could compile a "Complete Compendium of Corruption." The national prosecutors seem to need one copy per person to help with case handling.

Some say that "there may be no one who can remember the disaster in Northern Jiangsu when seeing a big mooncake." This is inaccurate. Surely not all of the many people from Northern Jiangsu who are wandering in Shanghai have forgotten their lovely hometown?

The biggest purpose of cracking down on vendors is to prevent the growth of wharf thieving. Someone has suggested: hiring all vendors as anti-smuggling personnel would not only treat the symptoms but also cure the root cause. But the water police agencies are said to already have six kinds of names, so I don't know if the authorities can allow "further expansion."

### The Young Bishop Yu Bin

— Zheng Fan

Bishop Yu Bin, recently returned from the Northeast, is considered by many foreigners to be "China's greatest Catholic." During the War of Resistance, he worked hard to promote China and raise disaster relief funds overseas, and his contributions to the motherland are truly indelible.

Returning in glory to his old home in the Northeast, which is Bishop Yu's hometown, when the Chicago Overseas Chinese welcomed Mr. Yu in 1939, Archbishop Stritch of Chicago said: "I firmly believe that the puppet organization of 'Manchukuo' will soon become a historical relic, and Bishop Yu will be able to return to his 'old home' in glory." Seven years later, Bishop Yu did return to his old home in glory, but the old home was now in a state of war, with "the rivers and mountains still the same, but the scenery completely different," (as Mr. Yu told reporters.) Bishop Yu could only reach Yongji, where he used to sell books as a child, and could only stay briefly, unable to go further north to reach his birthplace in Heilongjiang. Bishop Yu's heart must be filled with emotion and sorrow!

Mr. Yu's courtesy name is Yesheng, baptismal name Paul, and he is from Lansi County, Heilongjiang. After graduating from the First Normal School of Jiangsu Province, he studied at Aurora University. In 1924, he went to Rome to study at the "University of the Propaganda Fide," earning three doctoral degrees in philosophy, theology, and canon law. In 1933, he also obtained a doctorate in political science from the Italian National University and taught at the Urban University for many years. In the winter of the same year, he was appointed as the general supervisor of the National Catholic Action Association of China and returned to China to take office.

There is still a good story in Europe: Mr. Yu once accompanied the Papal Envoy to Abyssinia in Africa for inspection and received the Five-Star Medal from the Abyssinian Emperor. Returning to Italy, he also received a medal awarded by the Italian King. Not long after, Italy and Abyssinia became enemies, and Dr. Yu held medals from both countries, adding a delightful anecdote to international diplomatic history.

In the winter of 1933, the Pope issued an order to delineate fifteen counties, including Jiangning and Wuxi, within the Jiangsu Diocese as the Nanjing Diocese, stipulating that it should be managed by a Chinese bishop. Because a suitable person could not be found temporarily, Bishop Huijiliang acted as an agent. It was not until 1936 that the Holy See carefully considered the matter again and decided to appoint Dr. Yu Bin. In the end, this young Catholic, only thirty-six years old, became the twenty-third Chinese bishop among the one hundred and twenty-seven dioceses.

In 1939, when Mr. Yu went abroad, newspapers and magazines in various countries competed to publish news and speeches about Mr. Yu. For a time, Mr. Yu became the central figure in more than four hundred newspapers and was warmly welcomed by Catholics and overseas Chinese from all walks of life. Mayor Burton of Chicago presented him with a golden key to the city, frankly expressing his welcome. Bishop Yu spared no effort in promoting China's War of Resistance and raising funds for disaster relief in various countries. As he said when he met with reporters in Guilin after returning to China:

"In more than a hundred famous cities, I represented the helpless Chinese civilians and appealed to the people of the world for relief, and I also told them the heroic history of China's War of Resistance, winning the assistance and sympathy of countries around the world.

"A Catholic, in addition to fulfilling his national duties, has two things to do: first, relief, and second, international propaganda."

Mr. Yu went to various countries to promote aid to China and disaster relief. On the first day of the Lunar New Year, overseas Chinese in New York held a "Hundred Ambulance Movement Rally" under Mr. Yu's leadership, with more than 10,000 people participating in the parade, raising more than 20,000 US dollars in just four hours. Mr. Yu also published "China Newsletter" in Europe, publishing documents on China's War of Resistance, editorials from major newspapers, and news of construction in the rear, which was truly the beginning of China's overseas news agency. In New York, he published "English China Monthly," with an initial print run of 30,000 copies, which sold out immediately. Canada and South American countries all subscribed.

Mr. Yu is tall, has a loud voice, and is good at public speaking. In six weeks in the United States, he gave a total of 330 speeches. The "Montreal Renaissance News" described his speech as: "His words are solemn and accurate, without any embellishment. What is especially commendable is his spirit of universal love, even when condemning the enemy's atrocities, he has no attitude of hatred."

Although I am not a Catholic, I cannot help but pay my highest respect to Bishop Yu's spirit!

### Special Issue for the 9/9 Victory Commemoration - One Year After Victory - The Turmoil of International Politics

— Chu Yukun

(Winning the War Was Not Easy, Making Peace Is Even Harder) More than a year has passed since the end of World War II. In this past year, international political diplomats have tried their best to create world peace. However, the peace treaties with the defeated countries have not yet been signed, leaving the post-war world still in a state of war. True peace has not yet come to the world. Today, looking back on the evolution of international politics in the year since the victory, we are filled with emotion!

When Germany and Japan successively surrendered and World War II ended in victory, all of humanity was overjoyed, believing that the world would enter a new era of peace and democracy and share the prosperity of a peaceful world. Unexpectedly, in the year that followed, international political turmoil arose one after another, not only disappointing everyone but also making everyone believe that "winning the war was not easy, and making peace is even more difficult." In fact, far-sighted political diplomats had foreseen this, so during the war, the Atlantic Charter was published, and the San Francisco Conference was convened. The sole purpose was to draw up a detailed and precise "blueprint" for the post-war new world order before the war ended. In particular, the Potsdam Conference held by the Big Three of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union after Germany's surrender can be regarded as the starting point for the great powers' political diplomats to strive for peace. The so-called Potsdam Declaration included two important documents: first, the declaration of unconditional surrender to Japan jointly signed by the leaders of China, the United Kingdom, and the United States; and second, the declaration on Germany issued by the Big Three of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The latter made many contributions to the creation of peace in Europe. The most important are two points:

(A) Regarding the establishment of the Council of Foreign Ministers:

(1) Convene a meeting of the foreign ministers of China, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union to continue to do all necessary work to create peace and to discuss other issues raised by the powers at any time.

(2) The first meeting of foreign ministers is scheduled to be held in London on September 1.

(3) The immediate task of the Council of Foreign Ministers is to draft treaties with the five countries of the United States, Finland, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria, and to propose solutions to all important issues at the end of the European war, and submit them to the United Nations for decision;

(B) Regarding the control of Germany:

(1) Implement the measures stipulated in the Crimean Declaration on Germany to eliminate German militarism and Nazi remnants, and take other necessary steps in the future to ensure that Germany no longer threatens its neighbors and world peace.

(2) Thoroughly disarm Germany and its defenses, and strengthen the domestic industry of Germany that can be used for military production.

(3) Prepare to rebuild German political life on a democratic basis and enable the Germans to cooperate peacefully in international life.

(4) The organization of the German economy should focus on the development of agriculture and peaceful domestic industry.

(5) In accordance with the decision of the Crimean Conference, Germany should be responsible for compensating the United Nations for the losses it has suffered.

(6) Regarding the territorial issue, Germany should cede the city of Königsberg in East Prussia and its surrounding area to the Soviet Union.

(The Five-Power Conference Was Held as Scheduled) After the end of the Potsdam Conference, the declaration to Japan finally took effect because it was backed by the American atomic bomb. The Japanese Emperor broadcasted an announcement of unconditional surrender to the country on August 15, bringing World War II to a complete end. From Germany's surrender on May 9 to Japan's laying down of its arms, three months passed. Because the war in the Far East had not yet ended, the work of peace in Europe could not be carried out. After Japan surrendered and the entire war ended completely, convening an international conference to clean up the mess in post-war Europe naturally became a matter of urgency. Therefore, the foreign ministers of China, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union opened the meeting in London on September 10.

From September 11 to 20, the theme discussed by the five foreign ministers was the Italian issue, which included the following issues: The Italian border issue. Not only did France have territorial demands on Italy, but Yugoslavia also had territorial demands on Italy. The disposal of the Italian navy. How to allocate the remaining warships besides those that Italy should retain. The disposal of Italian colonies. Britain and the United States both had coveted ambitions for the colonies of Italian East Africa. The Italian reparations issue. The Soviet Union demanded that Italy pay 100 million US dollars in compensation, and Greece and Yugoslavia also demanded that Italy pay reparations. After ten days of discussion, only two issues were resolved. (1) The border between Italy and Yugoslavia on the Istrian Peninsula is based on ethnic boundaries. (2) The Port of Trieste is internationalized. The rest of the issues could not be resolved.

From September 20 to 25, the foreign ministers' meeting discussed the Balkan issue. The rift between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union became more obvious. First, Britain and the United States did not recognize the governments of Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Austria as democratic polities, so they insisted that they could not conclude treaties with these four countries until their politics were democratized. At the same time, they demanded that navigation on the Danube be internationalized, which the Soviet Union could not agree to under any circumstances. In the eyes of the Soviet Union, the Balkan Peninsula was the territory of the Slavic peoples, and they would never allow Britain and the United States to interfere. Therefore, Soviet Foreign Minister Filatov made a shocking proposal on September 22, arguing that countries that had not signed the armistice agreement should not participate in the drafting of the treaty. This proposal not only did not allow China to participate in the discussion of the European treaty, but also opposed France's involvement in the treaties with Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland. British Foreign Secretary Bevin and US Secretary of State Byrnes strongly opposed and engaged in a verbal battle with Filatov, but it was useless and could not change the Soviet Union's attitude. Therefore, the five foreign ministers' meeting was deadlocked.

By October 2, although the five foreign ministers still wanted to save the fate of the foreign ministers' meeting, they were ultimately unable to break the deadlock in the European issue, so the five foreign ministers broke up unhappily.

International Situation Suddenly Becomes Tense

After the five foreign ministers' meeting in London broke up unhappily, the international situation fell into a predicament. In addition, the secret issue of the atomic bomb made the relationship between Britain and the Soviet Union increasingly worse. From the perspective of Britain and the United States, they both stated that the secret of the atomic bomb could be made public or handed over to international control; but there was one condition, that the Soviet Union should declare its political and territorial ambitions. In the Soviet Union's view, this attitude and approach of Britain and the United States was tantamount to threatening the Soviet Union with the atomic bomb; therefore, the misunderstanding between the two sides deepened, and some American newspapers even advocated bombing Moscow with the atomic bomb. Therefore, the international situation was tense, making nervous people think that World War III was about to break out. At the same time, in the Middle East, the conflict between Britain and the Soviet Union over the Iranian issue became increasingly acute and was also full of gunpowder. In the Near East, because the Soviet Union refused to budge on the issue of the Turkish Straits, it repeatedly demanded joint defense of the straits with Turkey; the Balkan Peninsula had become the territory of the Slavic peoples, leaving only Greece, and the situation in Greece was chaotic, and the government was in danger of being overthrown without the support of British troops. In the Pacific, the Indonesian movement in the Dutch East Indies, resisting the Netherlands, was in full swing.

The United States Launches a Compromise with the Soviet Union

In the second half of 1945, the international situation became increasingly tense; however, the crux of the situation was the incompatibility between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. If the situation was to be eased, it was necessary to start by improving the relationship between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. US Secretary of State Byrnes, having realized this, did not hesitate to bow to Stalin and first demonstrated the understanding between the US and the Soviet Union. Then, he further initiated the convening of a meeting of the foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, attempting to break the current deadlock through the coordination of the three countries. Therefore, the foreign ministers of the three countries - Byrnes, Bevin, and Molotov - met in Moscow. At that time, the foreign ministers of the three countries adopted an attitude of "mutual tolerance for peace," and were willing to make concessions on any international issue, unlike the hardline stance at the five foreign ministers' meeting in London. Therefore, not long after the three foreign ministers' meeting opened, agreements were reached on various issues. According to the communiqué issued by the foreign ministers of the three countries, the results of the meeting were:

(1) Regarding the Japanese issue, the Far Eastern Advisory Committee will be reorganized into the Far Eastern Commission.

(2) Regarding the Chinese issue, the foreign ministers of the three countries reiterated the policy of non-interference in China's internal affairs.

(3) Regarding the Korean issue, the foreign ministers of the three countries agreed to place Korea under the trusteeship of the United States and the Soviet Union for a period of five years, with the United States in the south and the Soviet Union in the north.

(4) Regarding the issue of atomic energy, the three countries agreed to establish a committee to consider the various issues arising from the invention of atomic energy.

(5) The drafting of treaties with the five countries of Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland:

(1) The treaty with Italy will be drafted by the foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union;

(2) The treaties with Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary will be drafted by the foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union;

(3) The treaty with Finland will be drafted by the foreign ministers of Britain and the Soviet Union.

(6) The issue of convening a 21-nation peace conference. When the draft treaty is completed, the Council of Foreign Ministers will invite the other 17 member states to hold a 21-nation peace conference to review the draft treaties with the five countries of the United States, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland. This meeting must not be held before May 1, 1946.

The International Scene Gradually Becomes Bright

After the communiqué of the three foreign ministers' meeting was issued, US Secretary of State Byrnes returned to Washington, triumphantly reporting that the trip to Moscow had achieved significant results, and the resentment in the international community could be eliminated invisibly. A beautiful prospect was unfolded in front of peace. Soon, 1946 also began a glorious new year, and the United Nations General Assembly opened in London, making people in various countries extremely excited. Everyone thought that the world was saved, and there was hope for peace. British Foreign Secretary Bevin, in a speech to the House of Commons, said that "lasting world peace depends on the close cooperation of the United Nations and the three powers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union," which was met with enthusiastic applause from the mediators in the Lower House.

The United Nations General Assembly opened in London on January 10 of this year. Politicians and diplomats from various countries delivered grand speeches at the conference, describing their countries' ideals for world peace. They were all pleasing to the ear and enough to make people no longer believe that there were conflicts of interest between the great powers; but when these practical issues were brought up for discussion in the second stage, the situation was completely different. The representatives of various countries all took out their verbal swords and guns and showed their skills. Especially between Britain and the Soviet Union, for the sake of the Greek issue, postal car representatives argued until their faces were red and they were still unwilling to give up. Therefore, this ethereal prospect was also shattered.

However, when the United Nations General Assembly closed on February 10, the representatives of various countries still had some confidence in world peace. As British Prime Minister Attlee said in his closing speech, "The United Nations organization has now been placed on a solid foundation. The issues discussed by the conference, such as the secret of atomic energy and the world food panic, have all been initially resolved." The President of the General Assembly, Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak, fairly said: "All those who think that we can accomplish miracles will be disappointed; however, those who understand that the problems left over by the war can only be solved by joint action will be satisfied."

The first meeting of the United Nations General Assembly had such achievements, and it cannot be said that it was unsatisfactory. However, whether the United Nations organization can become an effective institution for maintaining world peace depends on the situation at the second meeting on September 23 of this year!

The United States Launches Another Four-Power Conference

The international situation did not ease because of the birth of the United Nations organization, but instead tended to become more tense in April of this year. US Secretary of State Byrnes, adhering to the original intention of peace, in order to restore the normal state of some European countries as soon as possible, especially Italy, Romania, Finland, Bulgaria, and Hungary, on April 4, respectively sent notes to the authorities of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, expressing regret over the delay in the work of the next meeting of the four foreign ministers, and argued that the four foreign ministers should meet in Paris on April 25 to decide on the 21-nation peace conference before May 1. Britain and France first expressed their approval, and then the Soviet Union also expressed its agreement. Therefore, the foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union met in Paris again on April 25.

From April 25 to the adjournment on May 16, the meeting was held for a total of 22 days. Although it cannot be said to have achieved significant results, considerable progress was made on some issues:

(1) Discussion of the issue of the treaty with Italy, the agreements reached include: 1. The issue of Italian reparations. The four foreign ministers agreed that Italy should pay 100 million US dollars in compensation to the Soviet Union; 2. The issue of the disposal of the national fleet. Except for some warships retained by Italy, the remaining warships were divided among the four powers. Greece and Yugoslavia also received some ships. 3. The Italian border issue: On the Italian-Austrian border issue, it was decided that the Upper Adige region of South Tyrol should be retained by Italy; on the French-Italian border issue, an investigation team was sent to conduct on-site inspections; the Italian-owned Dodecanese Islands were returned to Greece. 4. The issue of the disposal of Italy's old colonies: The opinions of the four powers of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. The Soviet representative advocated international trusteeship, that is, Tripoli was placed under the joint trusteeship of Italy and the Soviet Union, and Cyrenaica was placed under the joint trusteeship of Britain and Italy. After discussion, only a way to deal with it indefinitely could be adopted, and it would be discussed again in a few years.

(2) The Trieste Port issue: Yugoslavia demanded that Italy transfer the Venezia Giulia region and the Port of Trieste to Yugoslavia, and the Soviet Union expressed its agreement; however, Britain and the United States expressed their opposition. Finally, France proposed a compromise solution, and the Port of Trieste was internationalized.

(3) On the Balkan issue, the four foreign ministers decided that Hungary should cede Outer Transylvania to Romania. The Romanian-Bulgarian border remained unchanged. As for the issue of navigation on the Danube, Britain and the United States advocated international control, but the Soviet Union firmly opposed it, so an agreement could not be reached.

(4) The issues of Germany and Austria were also discussed, but no agreement was reached.

The four foreign ministers had been meeting for 21 days and were already exhausted. If they did not adjourn for a month, they would repeat the same mistakes as the five foreign ministers' meeting in London. Therefore, US Secretary of State Byrnes, seeing that things were not going well, proposed an adjournment for a month and to reopen on June 16. Therefore, the first foreign ministers' meeting in Paris ended hastily. (Continued on page 4)

### How to Commemorate the September 9th Victory

— Ma Chaojun

Today is the anniversary of the "September 9th" victory. On this day last year, Japan, which sought to conquer our country, had to sign the instrument of unconditional surrender to our nation. This illustrates that violence is unreliable, and aggressors are bound to fail. It also demonstrates that justice will ultimately triumph over might, and humanity has gradually emerged from the long night into the light.

Despite a year of victory, both domestically and internationally, the overall situation remains turbulent, and lasting peace has not been secured. Many are disappointed and pessimistic. However, this world has existed for millions of years, while our lives span only a few decades, representing but a fleeting moment in the history of the world. If we become disappointed and pessimistic due to temporary setbacks in humanity's evolutionary process, we are being too impatient and shortsighted. The Father of the Nation (Sun Yat-sen) taught us that human evolution progresses from animality to humanity, and then to divinity. Humanity has not yet fully shed its animality, so wars still occur frequently. However, based on the trend of human evolution, humanity will one day completely shed its animality and reach complete humanity, and one day evolve into divinity.

Comparing this war with the last, the victorious nations in the previous war adopted a retaliatory attitude towards the defeated nations, repaying wrong with wrong, leading to endless cycles of war. In this war, the victorious nations adopted a transformative attitude towards the defeated nations, repaying wrong with virtue and eliminating the roots of war. After the previous war, countries established the League of Nations. After this war, countries established the United Nations. The latter organization is much more effective in preventing war. Moreover, the United States remained outside the former organization, while it not only participates in the latter but also supports it with all its strength. Currently, there are still many disputes in each meeting of the United Nations, but the world's problems are too complex, and disputes are unavoidable. Looking at the history of the United States, disputes were also fierce in the beginning after the victory of the War of Independence. Later, everyone patiently resolved them one by one, and then they cooperated harmoniously. We firmly believe that the disputes in the United Nations will gradually decrease and eventually disappear, and humanity will gradually cooperate harmoniously to seek the happiness of mankind together. The United Nations has resolved many disputes in its short one-year history, which proves the correctness of this prediction.

Speaking of our China, this war of resistance can be said to have the same importance as the Xinhai Revolution. The Xinhai Revolution was to eliminate the Manchu Qing dynasty, which had enslaved us for more than two hundred years, while this war of resistance was to eliminate Japan, which intended to enslave us. The difficulties encountered after the success of the Xinhai Revolution were much greater than the hardships encountered after the victory of the War of Resistance. Although the Xinhai Revolution did not have as much destruction as the War of Resistance, the forces of counter-revolution were still all over the country, and the revolutionary forces were very small. However, the Father of the Nation disregarded all difficulties and resolutely fought against the counter-revolution, overthrowing Yuan Shikai's attempt to become emperor and eliminating Zhang Xun's restoration of the monarchy. Chairman Jiang, the successor of the Father of the Nation, also purged the warlords amidst great difficulties and hardships. The current revolutionary situation in our China is much better than in the early years of the Republic of China, and the people's knowledge has also been improved. They will no longer be deceived by political careerists who hang a sheep's head but sell dog meat. We firmly believe that all obstacles to the revolution will inevitably be cleared, and they will inevitably fail like Yuan Shikai and Zhang Xun. Some people have not shed blood, spent money, or contributed to the War of Resistance. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, they want to come out and compete for power and profit. They are simply the dregs of the nation and will undoubtedly be eliminated by the great era.

This world is in revolution, and our China is also in revolution. The victory of the War of Resistance is only a stage in the revolutionary process, and we must continue to struggle patiently. We achieved victory because we held the determination to resist Japan for a long time. We will succeed in building the country only if we hold the determination to build the country for a long time. During the Xinhai Revolution, everyone fantasized that after the revolution succeeded, China would immediately become a rich, strong, and prosperous country. They were unwilling to continue to struggle, so the fruits of the revolution were completely destroyed by counter-revolutionaries. During this War of Resistance, many people also fantasized that after the War of Resistance was won, China would immediately become a rich, strong, and prosperous country. This is also making the same mistake as after the Xinhai Revolution. Therefore, in this year, many people are disappointed, pessimistic, and resentful because their fantasies have not been realized. This is really because we do not have a clear understanding of the revolutionary process.

On this day last year, the whole country was celebrating the victory like crazy. This was appropriate. The victory in the eight-year War of Resistance was too hard-won. Today this year, when we celebrate the victory, we need to be calmer. We must face reality and also look forward to the future. We must complete the great cause of nation-building with the spirit of the War of Resistance. We should be optimistic about the future of the world, and we should be even more optimistic about the future of China. It takes great hardship to win the War of Resistance, and it takes great hardship to succeed in building the country. We did not waver in our confidence that we would win the War of Resistance for the past eight years, so we achieved the final victory in the War of Resistance. We must have the same confidence that we will succeed in building the country from beginning to end, and then we will succeed in building the country. The world and China can only improve from a bad situation through our continuous struggle. There is no other miracle. On this day of celebrating victory, we must make the greatest determination, prepare to endure all kinds of hardships, and be willing to sacrifice everything to patiently build a new world and a new China, so that we can live up to the martyred soldiers and the dead compatriots, and live up to the descendants of all ages. This world is progressing, and China is also progressing. No one can stop it. Let those who did not die in the War of Resistance work together!

### MacArthur's Achievements in Japan in the Past Year: Infusing New Blood, Filling the Vacuum

— Da Chun

The political winds of the United States have blown to the west coast of the Pacific. Many people are saying that General Douglas MacArthur, Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers in the Pacific, who is serving as the governor of occupied Japan, may participate in the next U.S. presidential election. During the last election, when General MacArthur was fighting in the Pacific, there were rumors that he would compete with the late President Roosevelt, but MacArthur denied it.

According to well-informed sources in Tokyo: he wants to be the governor.

General observers say: his hope lies in achieving a "model occupation," just as he praised his troops stationed in Japan as a "model victorious army."

A spokesman for MacArthur's headquarters also said: he still regards completing the mission of occupying Japan as his sole task.

Regardless of his political ambitions, this Supreme Commander of the United Nations has always put his full energy into his work in the year since he took office. He is doing it step by step according to his original plan, in order to achieve what he considers a perfect occupation. Setbacks are natural, but he is not discouraged. He seems to be prepared for everything.

Spirit of Hard Work

Recently, there have been many rumors that MacArthur, at the age of sixty-six, is unable to cope with this heavy responsibility and intends to retire. However, in fact, he has not been sick in the past year except for a slight cold. According to his doctor, he is in very good health and there is no problem at all. In terms of work, he is still working as hard as he did at the beginning, working eighteen hours a day.

He not only works hard, but also likes his work. At the same time, the Japanese people also respect and love him. Many people regard MacArthur as a "liberator," and some even praise him as "amazing."

In the past year, MacArthur has left Japan once to attend the grand ceremony of Philippine independence. He has issued more than three thousand instructions to the Japanese people. He has had two secret meetings with the Japanese Emperor. In May, someone attempted to assassinate him, but he still goes in and out alone, and even if there are attendants, they are not armed.

MacArthur loves his wife the most. His son, Arthur, is only eight years old and can already write sheet music. The family of three lives in the American Embassy.

Work Schedule

MacArthur's daily work routine is roughly as follows: He leaves home before 11:00 a.m., drives to the Allied Headquarters, and goes directly to his office on the sixth floor to work. He goes home for lunch at 1:30 p.m. He goes back to the office at 5:00 p.m. and works until 7:30 p.m. or 8:00 p.m. He works seven days a week, but stipulates that his employees work forty hours a week.

In front of the Allied Headquarters, there are always many American sergeants, overseas Chinese, and Japanese people surrounding the area, admiring MacArthur's demeanor and taking pictures of him. When MacArthur first took office, an adjutant ordered these people to be prohibited from gathering, and specifically ordered the Japanese to stand only on the opposite street. Later, when MacArthur found out, he immediately canceled the order.

At first, MacArthur can be said to have adopted a "laissez-faire" policy towards the interaction between American soldiers and Japanese people. Later, although there were some restrictions, on the whole, there was freedom of communication between the Japanese and American people, because MacArthur believed that proper contact between the two sides could help promote democratic ideas.

Promoting Democracy

Promoting democracy is the main purpose of MacArthur's handling of Japan's post-war policy. In his "Victory Anniversary" message on September 2, MacArthur said:

"...The result of Japan's total defeat is not only the overthrow of its military force and the defeat of the country, but also the disintegration of the Japanese people's beliefs... Whether morally, psychologically, or superficially, Japan has become a completely and utterly vacuum. And what is being infused into this vacuum is the democratic way of life. The American soldiers brought their self-esteem, self-confidence, and self-discipline. The Japanese people not only saw but also experienced this spirit of the American soldiers, and this spirit reflects the highest training that American soldiers receive at home. As a result, the Japanese people gradually felt the mistakes of the past education, the failure of the past leaders, and the tragedy of the past beliefs. This feeling is deepening day by day, and finally brewed a spiritual revolution... This spiritual revolution is the greatest achievement of the occupation of Japan in the past year—the achievement of democratic forces in seeking lasting peace..."

### The Sun Flag Dims! The Scene of Signing the Surrender on the USS Missouri

— Jun Mo

September 2, 1945, Sunday, the dawn over Tokyo Bay revealed a gray and hazy sky. The sun did not show its face, seeming to symbolize the decline of this Sun Flag empire. This was the day that Japan formally signed the surrender on the USS Missouri. The signing ceremony lasted only twenty minutes, but after the ceremony was over, suddenly, the sunlight came out of the clouds, shining again on the green waves, the glittering sea.

At 8:30 a.m., General MacArthur and Admiral Halsey walked onto the USS Missouri battleship. Various naval ships guarded the surroundings, sailing back and forth, and aircraft circled overhead on alert. The national flags of China, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France fluttered on the deck, and more than a hundred senior allied generals gathered on both sides of the ship's side, watching the open space on the deck in front of the captain's room. That was where the surrender instrument was to be signed, a small table covered with a green carpet placed there, with a chair placed in front and behind it.

At ten minutes to nine, representatives of the Allied nations appeared on the deck. In the distance, on the eastern horizon, there was the sound of faint thunder. Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu, wearing a prosthetic leg, climbed up the ladder on the side of the USS Missouri, followed by Chief of Staff Yoshijiro Umezu. As the two silently walked past the Allied representatives, no one spoke to them, and no one greeted them. The representatives of the eleven countries all had stern faces.

General MacArthur, the host of the surrender ceremony, stood in the middle. On the left were General Wainwright and General Percival, and on the right were Admiral Nimitz and Admiral Halsey. The representatives of the other Allied nations, mostly wearing splendid and gorgeous uniforms, stood behind. At exactly nine o'clock, General MacArthur stepped forward and addressed the audience in front of the loudspeaker:

"Representatives of the major Allied powers are gathered here today to sign the agreement, restoring peace. The terms of surrender of the Japanese Empire have been recorded in this instrument of surrender. I, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, hereby solemnly declare: I shall assume my responsibility with a firm determination of fairness and tolerance, and I shall take all necessary measures to ensure that all terms of surrender are fully and faithfully fulfilled.

"I now invite the representatives of the Japanese Empire and the representatives of the Japanese Supreme General Staff to come forward and sign the instrument of surrender."

Mamoru Shigemitsu took off his top hat, walked to the table, and signed his name on the instrument of surrender, which was twelve inches long and eight inches wide.

Yoshijiro Umezu then walked to the table with an iron-faced expression, sat down, and hurriedly signed his name.

"The Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers now signs on behalf of all nations fighting against Japan. Please General Wainwright and General Percival accompany me forward."

These two generals were heroes who fought hard for months in the Philippines after the Pearl Harbor incident and were finally captured by the Japanese army. Now, they have gotten their revenge.

MacArthur used five pens to sign his name. The first one was given to General Wainwright, the second one was given to General Percival, the third one was given to the U.S. government for preservation, the fourth one was given to West Point Military Academy, his alma mater, and the fifth one was a small red fountain pen, given to his wife.

After MacArthur finished signing, he stood up and announced: "The representative of the United States signs."

Nimitz walked to the table, quickly signed, and returned to his original position.

"The representative of China signs."

General Xu Yongchang, Chief of Military Orders, signed on behalf of China.

Then representatives of the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, Australia, Canada, France, the Netherlands, and New Zealand signed successively.

General MacArthur then stood in front of the loudspeaker and solemnly announced:

"Let us hope that the world returns to peace and remains peaceful forever. The ceremony is over."

More than two hundred and fifty bombers, led by fifty B-29 Superfortresses, and hundreds of fighters escorting them in formation, roared over the USS Missouri, seemingly demonstrating to the dispirited Japanese representatives. At this moment, the sun emerged from the clouds, illuminating the earth.

### The Cause and Effect of Japan's Surrender

— Jia Nan

It has been a full year since Japan surrendered. I still remember on this day a year ago, Yasuji Okamura, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Forces in China, formally signed the instrument of unconditional surrender of the Japanese army in the China theater in Nanjing. Japan, which had originally determined to defeat China to the point of kneeling, actually knelt down to China. Now we might as well review why Japan failed? Many people will say: Japan's failure was due to the atomic bomb. This answer is, of course, quite accurate. In fact, in the stage when the war was approaching its end, Japan's scientific technology had indeed fallen far behind the Allied nations, and the method of desperate resistance was already powerless.

But this is not the fundamental cause of the failure.

The Biggest Enemy is the Japanese Themselves

We should remember that Japan did indeed achieve considerable gains in the early stages of the war. So how did the initiative, which was originally in Japan's hands, fall into the hands of the Allied nations? A military strategist once said: "A country's greatest enemy is often itself." Japan's failure was indeed "self-inflicted."

Let's first talk about Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor: that attack not only angered the Americans, but also left the Japanese people at a loss. We only need to look at the date when Japan launched the Pacific War to see the imprudence of the Japanese military. Tojo and his followers did not launch an attack when Hitler began to attack the Soviet Union, nor did they respond until the German army besieged Stalingrad, but instead launched it on December 8, 1941, which was a huge mistake. Because at that time, the Soviet army was fighting back against the German army in the freezing cold, it did not receive the effectiveness of cooperating with the German war strategy. This was the first serious mistake made by the Japanese government.

The second mistake was the inconsistency of Japanese strategy. The goal of the Japanese Navy was to control the central and western Pacific, while the Army wanted to conquer the southeast and central Asia. The strategy of the Japanese Supreme Command was built on these two goals, and as a result, neither goal was achieved.

As a military strategist said, war is an art of concentration. If Japan had adhered to one goal at a time, she might have had a chance to turn things around. But the Japanese did not do this, and instead diverted their attention to two goals. By the time they realized their mistake, it was too late.

According to the joint strategy of the three Axis powers of Germany, Japan, and Italy: these three Axis countries should have tried to establish contact in certain places, but they did not take consistent action. When Rommel defeated the British army in Africa and advanced directly to Alexandria, the Japanese army should have launched a full-scale attack towards the Suez Canal area and built a bridge of the Axis powers in the Indian Ocean area. But the Japanese did not do this, but instead were busy bombing Darwin and launching attacks on the islands of the South Pacific. Another part of the soldiers were transferred to the Aleutian Islands. This chaotic pace formed a clear contrast with the planned and consistent action of the Allied nations.

The Third Mistake is Overconfidence

The third mistake Japan made was overconfidence. If the Japanese had allowed the Asian countries to gain true autonomy after conquering them, they might have easily created pro-Japanese sentiments in Asia. But the Japanese warlords in Tokyo believed that final victory was absolutely guaranteed, so they began to draft imperialist plans to exploit and control the people of various Asian regions. The Japanese worked hard to instill ideas of hatred for white people, but their own actions quickly aroused the hatred of the local people, which was tantamount to digging their own graves.

The mistakes made by the Japanese were not limited to the conquered countries. In fact, the people of Japan also deeply resented the government's actions. At the beginning of the war, the Japanese people thought they were engaged in a war of liberation, but the unfolding of the truth made them understand that all the propaganda was complete lies, which destroyed the people's beliefs. Once the belief in war is lost, there is no chance of victory at all.

Warmongers Have Learned a Profound Lesson

At the same time, war reports also made the Japanese people no longer believe the words of the Japanese military. For example, Japanese newspapers often talked about how the U.S. 58th Special Task Force had been "annihilated," but later this fleet actually hit Japan's doorstep. Therefore, the Japanese people gradually went from doubt to distrust, and from distrust to disappointment, regarding the victories that the military tried to exaggerate. By the time the Allied fleet approached the city and the situation was perilous, it was impossible to reverse the situation.

The above points are the fundamental reasons for Japan's failure. The extremism and lack of foresight of the Japanese military ultimately led to tragic results. The lessons of the Japanese can also serve as a profound lesson for all warmongers.

### An Overview of the Handling of Enemy and Puppet Industries in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Regions

Japan announced its surrender on August 11, 1945, while China formally accepted the surrender on September 9th, a gap of nearly a month. The chaotic situation in the occupied areas during this period can be imagined. Even after the surrender, the lack of a unified central policy for the reception and handling of enemy and puppet industries made consistent reception efforts difficult.

The Shanghai Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau was established on October 27, 1945, with only a few days for orders and preparation, a very rushed process. This was the earliest such organization established nationwide, with no precedent to follow. The six articles of the Shanghai Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Measures, announced by the Executive Yuan on October 24th, served as the sole guidelines for our operations.

Shanghai, the largest commercial port in the country and a wealthy region in the Southeast, had experienced numerous property disputes and transfers due to eight years of occupation and usurpation by the enemy and puppets. The situation was further complicated by the changes in the two months between the victory and the establishment of our Bureau. In the spring of 1946, we were ordered to expand our operations to the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui regions, making our mission even more arduous.

Of this one trillion income, about 40% was directly received after the Bureau's establishment. People often focus on the large number of enemy and puppet factories, unaware of the substantial amount of enemy and puppet materials. The safekeeping and handling of these materials were more challenging than that of the factories. The same applied to enemy and puppet real estate, which was also quite valuable. The income from investigations was almost unexpected; if we had been slightly negligent, it would have been largely dispersed.

The income from enemy and puppet industries was included in the national treasury budget, so we had to sell and remit as much as possible. Except for certain agencies authorized by the Executive Yuan to transfer funds or sell to other agencies, the rest had to be sold for cash. This was a policy decision made by the Executive Yuan in line with financial and economic policies, and we could only comply. By the end of August, we had remitted over 233.1 billion national currency yuan to the national treasury, not including the transfers and sales to other agencies.

The general situation of reception and handling was roughly as follows:

Wharves and Warehouses: A total of 1,156 warehouses were taken over through customs. Most have been taken over, and the majority of stored materials have been entrusted to various agencies for sale. More than half of the warehouses have been emptied.

Factories: The Shanghai factories entrusted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for reception totaled 480, of which 286 were purely enemy-owned. The most common types were machinery, chemical, and textile factories. Outside Shanghai, we received 162 factories in other parts of the region.

In accordance with the regulations of the Executive Yuan, some factories were transferred to the Resource Commission, the Textile Industry Management Committee, the National Silk Company, the China Tobacco Company, and the Ministry of Health. Others were returned to Allied merchants and Chinese citizens. In principle, they should be put back into operation first, and the rest were offered for sale through bidding, either with the factory buildings and land or just the equipment. Recently, we were ordered to give priority to factories returning from the rear for purchase or lease, as a form of preferential treatment.

Real Estate and Furniture: We received over 2,100 enemy and puppet houses and over 6.3 million mu of land, with an estimated total value of about 120 billion yuan. Many real estate properties were returned to Chinese citizens and Allied expatriates after reception. All enemy and puppet real estate is sold in principle, and we are currently organizing auctions. We received over 38,000 pieces of furniture. There are still houses that belong to traitors out there.

Fuel: Fuel and oils, including gasoline, aviation gasoline, and lubricating oil, totaling over 2,000 barrels each, were entrusted to the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. There were also kerosene, diesel oil, and alcohol, which are liquid fuels. Solid fuels included over 700,000 tons of bituminous coal, anthracite coal, charcoal, and firewood. Recently, the handling of liquid fuels was transferred to the China Petroleum Corporation.

Ships: We entrusted the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company with the reception of 35 river steamers and one ocean-going vessel. Other small steamers, sailing junks, motorboats, iron barges, and civilian boats totaled over 1,200. The former Naval Headquarters received over 100 vessels, some of which were transferred and others retained. No fewer than 400 vessels were returned.

Vehicles: We entrusted the Highway Administration with the reception of over 600 trucks, over 60 passenger cars, and over 1,300 cars. After some were sold to various agencies and returned to their owners, the rest were auctioned.

Military Supplies, Aircraft, and Warships

The types and quantities of military supplies were extremely numerous and were all taken over by the Ministry of National Defense. The Aviation Committee received seven airlines, factories and airfields, and 170 aircraft. The Navy received 21 warships.

Food: Food was received by the Ministry of Food and was all sold through bidding.

Agriculture, Forestry, Fisheries, and Animal Husbandry: The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry received a total of 55 units, including farms, animal husbandry, fisheries, cotton production, sericulture, and animal epidemic prevention organizations.

Educational and Cultural Institutions: The Ministry of Education and the Municipal Education Bureau received universities and colleges, research institutes, libraries, enemy-established middle schools, puppet-established middle schools, enemy-established primary schools, sports fields, zoos, cinemas, and theaters. The Central Propaganda Department received a total of 200 units, including newspapers, news agencies, radio stations, film studios, bookstores, stationery stores, and printing factories.

Trading Companies: The Central Trust Bureau was entrusted with the reception of 263 enemy and puppet-operated trading companies, and their materials were sorted and sold separately.

Small Shops: The city government received and handled 463 small shops. Recently, these have been transferred to the Handling Bureau.

Gold, Silver, Coins, and Securities: This category included the assets received by various agencies, including the four major banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank of China), as well as the Central Trust and Postal Remittances and Savings Bureau. Gold, silver, U.S. dollars, and puppet currency were the most common.

Raw Materials and Finished Products: Cotton yarn, cotton cloth, cotton, and rayon were the most abundant, followed by chemical industrial raw materials, paper, hardware, and machine parts. These were entrusted for sale or sold at reduced prices to state-owned enterprises.

German Properties: The largest was Deutsch-Asiatische Bank, with received gold and silver valued at 200 million yuan and inventory valued at 20 billion yuan, totaling about 20.7 billion yuan along with other assets. The inventory received from Bayer Pharmaceutical was valued at 2.5 billion yuan. The combined inventory and other assets of other German trading houses, such as Carlowitz & Co., totaled about 3.9 billion yuan. The above totaled 28.2 billion yuan. All received Western medicines and dyes were sorted, packaged, and sold.

Traitor Properties: Traitor properties were originally handled by the former Shanghai Traitor Property Liquidation Committee and later transferred to our Bureau. Our Bureau handled 531 traitor property cases. The handover of seized traitor properties by the Military Intelligence Bureau was largely completed. The received assets included houses, land, stocks, ornaments, furniture, and other items such as pianos, automobiles, books, and antiques.

The above can be considered a reception account. In addition, there are a few tasks worth supplementing.

The cleaning of factories and wharf warehouses was very heavy, and there was no absolute standard for valuation, so it was inevitable that people would criticize us. However, after explanation or on-the-spot investigation, the truth would become clear.

The investigation work has long been over, because the nature of the work is to accept secret reports and investigate concealment. If you are not careful, it will disturb the people. This is what we always told ourselves to pay attention to in the past. Some informants always feel that the bonuses are issued too slowly or too little, but according to case-by-case investigations, there are special reasons, and it is not the case that the undertakers deliberately suppressed it, which can be guaranteed.

Resolving property rights disputes is also a heavy task. A total of more than 4,000 cases require investigating facts, searching for evidence, and summoning hostages, again and again, to ensure fairness and justice. Most of the meetings of the review committee were to discuss property rights disputes. Sometimes the parties said that we were dealing with them slowly, but unfortunately we were not able to let him check the entire record of the process, otherwise he would definitely understand and understand.

Regarding the sale of materials, we strive to clear the treasury quickly and contribute to the national treasury revenue. In addition, pay attention to assisting in stabilizing prices. Although the Bureau receives a lot of materials, it is ultimately limited. According to the active situation of floating capital in Shanghai, we must proceed carefully, keep an eye on market changes, and sell dynamically, otherwise, the materials will fall into the hands of speculators, and the people will not only not get practical benefits, but will be even more oppressed by high prices. Therefore, in terms of methods, flat sales, auctions, and tenders are all adopted. In terms of quantity and type, each time the sell-off is different and unequal, so that speculators cannot take advantage of it. Sometimes, the society criticizes us, and we rarely argue. For example, when rice prices soared this spring, the society criticized us for why we didn't sell a large amount of rice. In fact, we didn't receive much rice at all, but if we said that at the time, to what extent would the rice price jump, everyone can imagine. There are many things like this. We are honest and have nothing to be ashamed of, but for the benefit of the country and the government, we will never argue for a day's length.

The work of handling traitor properties is now beginning. The Traitor Property Handling Committee has been established, and it is jointly organized by court colleagues and local leaders. This institution can exist independently in the future, until the business is completely over.

Reviewing the work of the past ten months, under the guidance of the Executive Yuan and the Review Committee, and with the assistance of all sectors of society, we have finally overcome many difficulties. If the work of the handling bureau still has some achievements, it should be attributed to everyone's cooperation.

According to the current situation, the business of the Handling Bureau can be largely completed in three or four months, and the agency is also preparing to shrink at any time. During this period, we still sincerely hope that all sectors will give us instructions at any time!

After the establishment of the Handling Bureau, the first step was to follow the Yuanling decree to cancel the original receiving and handling agencies in Shanghai, such as the Shanghai Private Industrial and Commercial Processing Committee, the Shanghai Real Estate Processing Committee, the Third Army Military Supplies Receiving Committee, the Shanghai Municipal Party and Government Receiving Committee, and the Shanghai Area Traitor Production Clearing Committee, and request their cancellation. All businesses are transferred to the Bureau for processing. This handover work was not completed smoothly and quickly, because very few individuals or agencies inevitably believed that after receiving it, it was their own, and they would never report it again, and some did not ask the Japanese for the original inventory at the beginning, or refused to hand over the original inventory received. All kinds of trivial problems require repeated negotiations to solve, so some industries and materials have not been transferred to the Bureau until May and June this year. During this period, it is more like doing diplomacy than processing.

The six handling measures promulgated by the Executive Yuan are the highest principles. Many supplementary regulations and measures are still needed in the implementation. At the same time, we are determined to do everything fairly and reasonably, and do everything on track without exception. Therefore, many rules and regulations have been formulated one after another. These are carefully researched and drafted by experts or competent colleagues, and prudently decided by the Review Committee, and implemented after being submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and record. In the future, our handling of cases must seek to be in line with these regulations and methods. At the same time, new rules and regulations are formulated to adapt to newly occurring facts.

Speaking of the received industries and materials, the estimated total value is more than one trillion yuan. If analyzed according to type, (1) cash is 1.5 billion yuan, (2) raw materials and finished products are 300 billion yuan, (3) gold and silver jewelry is 90 billion yuan, (4) factories are 300 billion yuan, (5) real estate is 100 billion yuan, (6) wharf warehouses are 100 billion yuan, (7) German properties are 31 billion yuan, (8) ships are 10 billion yuan, (9) food is 9.7 billion yuan, (10) financial institutions are 800 million yuan, (11) cultural facilities are 5.5 billion yuan, (12) aquatic products are 2.5 billion yuan, (13) fuel is 2.3 billion yuan, (14) vehicles are 2.3 billion yuan, (15) coins are 2.3 billion yuan, (16) securities are 1.8 billion yuan, (17) furniture supply is 1.8 billion yuan, and (18) farms are 1.5 billion yuan. In addition, the traitor property part and the military supplies part have not been listed. If analyzed according to the nature of the source, roughly estimated, the one that belongs to purely enemy production is 50% to 60%, the one that belongs to puppet production is 30%, and the rest accounts for about 10%.

### National Affairs in the Past Year

— Xu Woming

China's political situation in the past year since the Japanese invaders surrendered has revolved around two historically significant documents: (1) the formulation of the "Outline for Peaceful National Construction" and the establishment of other related agreements; (2) Chairman Chiang's announcement in Lushan on the first anniversary of Japan's unconditional surrender. The formulation of the "Outline for Peaceful National Construction" and the establishment of other related agreements are the most meaningful achievements of the past year. To formulate and implement this plan, we have seen Chairman Chiang's talks with CCP leader Mao Zedong in the autumn in the capital, the convening of the Political Consultative Conference, the meetings of the Constitution Drafting Committee, and in the military field, the basic plan established by the Military Subcommittee and the dispatch of mediation and execution teams to various places to carry out mediation, as well as the issuance and extension of the ceasefire order, and so on. All these activities occupied most of the early period of the past year. However, the agreements obtained through the hard work of all parties have encountered very great difficulties in their implementation or execution. Except for the government's unilateral implementation of the "Outline for Peaceful National Construction," it has not been implemented to this day. "Nationalization of the army" is still just an ideal, and "political democratization" is still just a goal. Moreover, because of the "negotiations," it has evolved into a protracted situation of so-called "negotiating while fighting." Since the beginning of spring, Changchun and Harbin have been successively occupied by the Communist army, and large-scale offensives have been launched in "Northern Jiangsu" and "Central Plains." Wars are everywhere, and people are struggling to make a living. The national trunk traffic, except for the Nanjing-Shanghai and Guangzhou-Hankou areas, is still blocked and has not been restored, so the country and the people feel the hardship. Under this situation, Chairman Chiang issued a historically significant announcement in Lushan on the eve of the first anniversary of Japan's unconditional surrender, pointing out the crux of the current situation and the six points of the policy for dealing with the current situation in the future, which is the most important document of the later period of the past year. This newspaper once praised it as "the great charter for national revival," which shows the importance of its relationship. Recently, there has been a plan to form a five-person group to discuss the reorganization of the National Government, hoping to fundamentally solve the current situation in the reorganization of the National Government. Although this plan for a five-person group is a recent event, its significance still cannot exceed the two historically significant documents mentioned above.

The Political Consultative Conference was undoubtedly the most significant political event of the past year. The convening of this conference originated from the talks between the government and the CCP representatives after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Chairman Chiang invited Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the CCP, to come to the capital to discuss national affairs. Mao responded to the invitation and arrived in Chongqing on August 28 last year to meet with the Chairman. He held many talks, and at the same time, both sides sent representatives to conduct more detailed discussions in a friendly and harmonious atmosphere. On the National Day celebration, both sides jointly issued a memorandum of the talks in Chongqing. The first point was that both sides "unanimously believed that the Chinese Anti-Japanese War has ended victoriously, and a new stage of peaceful national construction is about to begin. We must work together to build a new China that is independent, free, prosperous, and strong on the basis of peace, unity, and unification, and thoroughly implement the Three Principles of the People under the leadership of Chairman Chiang." Both sides also agreed that the political democratization, nationalization of the army, and equality and legality of parties advocated by Chairman Chiang are the only way to achieve peaceful national construction. The second point was that both sides "unanimously believed that the period of political tutelage should be ended quickly and constitutional government should be implemented. The necessary steps should be taken first, and the National Government should convene a political consultative conference, inviting representatives of various parties and social elites to discuss national affairs, discuss plans for peaceful national construction, and discuss various issues related to the convening of the National Assembly...." According to the spirit of this key point, the Political Consultative Conference was convened in the capital on January 10 this year, with eight representatives from the Kuomintang, seven representatives from the Communist Party, five representatives from the Chinese Youth Party, nine representatives from the Democratic League of China, and nine "non-party representatives," also known as "social elites." The conference concluded successfully on January 31.

At the closing session of the "Political Consultative Conference," in Chairman Chiang's opening speech, the Chairman "believed that among the various proposals (the various proposals established by the Political Consultative Conference), the "Outline for Peaceful National Construction" is the basis and center of the various plans, because each provision of this plan is unusually complete, meets the requirements of the times, is full of unity, and is full of democracy, and is indeed the most suitable outline for crossing into the constitutional period. With this outline, from the central government to the local governments across the country, from all parties and factions and social leaders to compatriots all over the country, we have a common standard to abide by. Since all parties and factions that participated in this conference jointly discussed and jointly agreed on this outline, and will participate in the government to jointly implement it, we must keep our promises to compatriots across the country and be responsible for our actions, first from the fact that there is a real performance of compliance, and must penetrate its national character so that it can be universally realized." This "Outline for Peaceful National Construction," which was established through consultation by various parties and factions and social elites, stipulates in its general principles: "(1) Adhering to the Three Principles of the People as the highest guiding principle for national construction; (2) Uniting all national forces under the leadership of Chairman Chiang to build a unified, free, and democratic new China; (3) Confirming the "political democratization," "nationalization of the army," and equality and legality of parties advocated by Chairman Chiang as the only way to achieve peaceful national construction; (4) Resolving disputes by political means to maintain the peaceful development of the country." The military aspects are to ensure the unity of army formation and military orders, army restructuring, separation of army and party, separation of army and civilians, and all national armies should be effectively reduced in accordance with the army reorganization plan, all of which are to achieve the purpose of "nationalization of the army."

As for "political democratization," there are agreements on enriching the National Government, the National Assembly, and the draft constitution to accommodate people from all walks of life with the National Government as the highest decision-making body. Among them, regarding the draft constitution, some advocated adopting a "bicameral system" and a "cabinet system," but it was only a reference for the National Assembly and had no binding power on the National Assembly itself. As for the National Assembly part, after several twists and turns, an agreement was finally reached, that is, adding 700 new representatives, of which 230 representatives were from the Kuomintang, 200 from the Communist Party, 100 from the Democratic League, 100 from the Youth Party, and 70 from social elites. The Kuomintang and the Communist Party agreed to give 10 names to the Democratic League within their quotas, that is, the Kuomintang was 220, the Communist Party was 190, and the Democratic League was 120. After the agreement was reached, the National Government ordered the National Assembly to be convened in Nanjing on May 5 this year. Unexpectedly, the CCP deliberately destroyed it, and other parties followed suit and refused to submit the list of representatives, so the National Assembly had to be postponed again and again, and it was postponed to November 12 this year. In addition, the government representatives and the Communist Party representatives signed a method for stopping conflicts and restoring traffic with the assistance of Special Envoy Marshall.

After the "Political Consultative Conference" had reached an agreement, the National Government officially announced on May 5 this year that it would return the capital to Nanjing. At the same time, it announced the Prime Minister and paid homage to the Mausoleum. The government, which had moved west for eight years, returned to the capital established by the founding father. However, the political sky in the country did not become brighter because of the government's return to the capital. Since the return of the capital, although various groups have maintained contact, the actual situation has become increasingly worse, resulting in a situation of "talking and fighting," which has dragged on for months without results. The ink of the "reorganization" and "unified reorganization" agreements was not dry, not only did the military orders and political orders fail to unify the CCP army, but they also attacked everywhere. The domestic traffic was still blocked as before. The ceasefire order was extended indefinitely, but the act of fighting had not been reduced at all. The people's suffering was increasing, and the political deadlock had not been broken. Chairman Chiang issued an announcement to the people of the country in Lushan on the eve of the anniversary of Japan's unconditional surrender, pointing out the crux of the domestic situation in the past year, that the end lies in the failure of the CCP to implement the various agreements established and deliberately obstruct and expand the difficulties. Regarding the policy for dealing with the current situation in the future, the Chairman pointed out six points: "(1) We will never delay the process of ending political tutelage and starting constitutional government because of any obstacles. The National Assembly on November 12 must be convened as scheduled. (2) We must sincerely abide by and strive to promote all the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. Regarding the draft constitution, we only seek to gather better opinions from all parties and provide them to the National Assembly for discussion and decision, so as to produce a perfect and feasible constitution. (3) We must quickly realize the expansion of the government's foundation and invite people from all parties and non-partisan parties to participate, and take the Outline for Peaceful National Construction as the guideline for governance. (4) Regarding the cessation of conflict, we still fail to abide by the original agreement and faithfully fulfill it, and we do not demand that the Communist army withdraw from the areas it occupied after the ceasefire order, but only ask them to withdraw from some areas that have already posed a threat to peace and obstructed traffic. (5) We will still adopt the method of political solution to political disputes. As long as the Communist Party army faithfully implements the agreement to stop the conflict and restore traffic, invites mediation, and implements unified reorganization, so that the nationalization of the army will not be in vain. As soon as this layer is guaranteed, the government can discuss all outstanding issues with it concretely at any time. (6) The most urgent demand of the people at present is to live and work in peace and contentment, so the government must do its best to eliminate the threat of peace, and must also fulfill its duties to protect the lives, property and safety of the people.

Since the announcement of Chairman Jiang's announcement, it has shown a clear direction for dealing with the current situation in the future, making people feel as if there is "no way to go when the mountains and rivers are exhausted, and there is another village where the flowers are bright." Based on the spirit of this announcement, the two emissaries, Marshall and Sze, traveled between Beijing and Pyongyang despite their old age and hot weather, and ran around to establish a plan to form a five-person group to discuss the reorganization of the National Government Committee, whose task is limited to discussing the reorganization of the National Government Committee and not other matters. The government has also appointed Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Lisheng as representatives, and the envoy also agreed to serve as chairman. However, the Communist Party initially demanded "veto power" and then raised other conditions as a threat. As a result, the plan is now on the verge of miscarriage. However, the envoy is still not afraid of hard work and travels back and forth. Whether the group can be established, whether an agreement can be reached after its establishment, and whether the agreement can be faithfully implemented after the agreement is reached, will have to be proved by future developments.

In summary, the crux of the domestic political situation in the past year lies in the failure of the CCP to implement the established agreements. In order to take care of the people's need for rest and recuperation after the war, the government spared no effort to bear the responsibility with extreme tolerance and sincerely negotiated with the CCP and people from all parties and non-partisan parties. However, the results of these negotiations were expected to become texts due to the CCP's delay in abiding by and implementing them. So what is the value of the establishment of the agreement? Today, when we review the domestic political situation in the past year, for the sake of the people, we want to appeal again to the CCP not to be an enemy of the people. For the established agreements, we must abide by and implement them, and for the future national construction, we rely on sincere unity. The world political situation in the year after the war was turbulent and unstable. In this turbulent and unstable world, all parties must cooperate sincerely to devote themselves to the revival of China.

### The International Political Turmoil of the Past Year (Continued from Page One)

The Mutual Mistrust Deepens

During the month-long recess of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, the mistrust between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union deepened. The United States displeased the Soviet Union in the following ways: (1) The U.S. seemed unwilling to grant loans to Poland; (2) Britain and the U.S. protested the situation in Romania; (3) Britain and the U.S. interfered in the case of Yugoslav General Mihailović, who was accused of collaborating with the enemy; (4) German ships traveling on the Danube River were detained by U.S. occupation forces; (5) According to the Potsdam Agreement, Germany was required to use certain industrial equipment as reparations, but the U.S. military authorities ordered a halt to the removal of such equipment; (6) British troops stationed in Greece refused to withdraw. On the Soviet side, there were also unfriendly actions towards Britain and the U.S.: (1) The Soviet Union strengthened its close relations with all countries within its sphere of influence; the signing of the Soviet-Polish agreement proved this; (2) Yugoslav Marshal Tito visited Moscow, and his anti-American stance became more blatant; (3) Denmark also showed a tendency to develop trade with the East; (4) Soviet troops also moved from Austria to Germany to reinforce defenses; (5) The Soviet Union, Poland, and Yugoslavia did not participate in the British victory parade; (6) The Soviet Union's ambitions regarding the Turkish Straits had become a well-known fact; (7) Soviet activities in southern Iran threatened British interests.

The Conference Reopens After a Month

The month-long recess ended quickly, and the Four Foreign Ministers met again in Paris on June 16. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes, with the greatest determination to achieve peace, returned to Paris. Before his departure, President Truman personally saw him off at the airport, making Byrnes feel even more strongly that the Council of Foreign Ministers "must succeed and cannot fail." However, upon arriving in Paris, the atmosphere of optimism was very thin. Nevertheless, Byrnes' sole objective was to ensure that the 21-nation peace conference could be held, which would be a great achievement in itself, and other issues could be discussed at the conference.

At the second Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, the foreign ministers of Britain and the United States firmly advocated that the 21-nation peace conference should be held in Paris on July 28. However, the Soviet representative expressed dissent, believing that the 21-nation peace conference could not be convened until all outstanding issues had been agreed upon. After several rounds of verbal sparring, the Soviet Union finally relented and agreed in principle to the British and American proposals. However, disputes arose again when discussing the countries to be invited to the 21-nation peace conference and its rules of procedure. Fortunately, France repeatedly mediated, preventing a breakdown. They also stepped up their work and completed five draft peace treaties, namely the draft treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland. By the time of the closing on July 15, the following achievements had been made:

(1) Regarding the peace conference, the Four Foreign Ministers decided that the 21-nation peace conference would be held in Paris on July 28 to discuss the draft peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland; the German and Austrian questions would not be discussed for the time being.

(2) Regarding the peace treaties, the Four Foreign Ministers unanimously passed the draft peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland.

Although there were heated debates and constant waves during the second Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, the fact that it was able to achieve the above two major results in the end cannot be said to be an improvement over previous conferences.

On July 28, 1946, representatives from 21 countries gathered at the Luxembourg Palace in France, and the first post-war peace conference finally opened under the world's watchful eyes. By the time the author is writing this, it has been almost forty days. Although verbal battles have been frequent and waves have been surging, with one wave barely subsiding before another rises, the people of the world who long for peace are hoping for the success of the peace conference. We also believe that the future of the Paris Peace Conference is bright and that it will soon come to a satisfactory conclusion. (September 6)

### Post-Surrender Relief and Rehabilitation

— Ping Qi

The Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) was established in January of the 34th year (1945), which was eight months before the victory. Because the enemy forces blockaded our country's coastline, all transportation during these eight months had to rely on air transport over the Hump.

The supplies we requested from the United Nations for assistance totaled four million tons, but the total weight of supplies that arrived in our country by air transport during the eight months before the victory was only about one hundred tons. Therefore, we may as well say that almost all the post-surrender relief and rehabilitation work was done after the surrender.

Because Japan's surrender came somewhat suddenly, many planned projects were affected. UNRRA originally had a fairly complete plan for implementing relief and rehabilitation in China, but because this victory came somewhat unexpectedly, some disconnects occurred. For example, in order to get supplies to China as quickly as possible, many ships that were en route temporarily changed course and diverted supplies intended for the military to China. This was the good intention of the Allied nations towards our country, and we can only be grateful. However, the supplies that were delivered were not necessarily what the general public in our country, who were in urgent need of relief, needed. Secondly, because we ourselves had not been able to restore transportation equipment and transportation lines to a sufficient extent, the supplies were inevitably released more slowly, leading to criticism from UNRRA, and even the Director-General of UNRRA, La Guardia, issued an order to stop shipping supplies to China.

If we could have achieved peaceful unification after the victory, this temporary disconnect should have been quickly adjusted. However, what followed was a nationwide conflagration that quickly spread beyond control. UNRRA suffered its greatest test at this time—unfortunately, it was unable to cope with this enormous blow!

New disaster areas emerged, and the relief of refugees in northern Jiangsu became an important issue. According to UNRRA's original plan, this part of the relief was not as serious as it is now.

The restoration of transportation was made almost impossible by the war. In northern Shandong, for example, relief supplies could not pass through layers of fire. Incidents of troops intercepting supplies occurred frequently, and dozens of relief workers had already died in the line of duty. Ships, vehicles, and laborers were often requisitioned, and relief and rehabilitation in many areas had entered a state of paralysis. Moreover, UNRRA's assistance to our country had been greatly reduced. The food we urgently needed amounted to less than 40% of the required amount. And this 40% of the total amount could not be transported to the areas that should have received emergency relief due to transportation difficulties and the lack of transportation equipment!

At the same time, UNRRA's organization was established in accordance with the original plan, and the deadline for the work was quite tight. Many things could not be prepared in time. For example, UNRRA's communication network in various relief areas was not yet set up. For example, the Shanghai headquarters has never received a telegram sent by UNRRA's Yantai office. Under such circumstances, how can we "seize the time"?

Recently, I heard that UNRRA's working period may be extended, which is indeed a slightly reassuring piece of news. However, if the situation cannot be quickly clarified, the future of relief and rehabilitation work is still bleak.

### Commemorating the "Double Ninth" Victory: Paying Respect to Chairman Chiang

"We must have confidence that our nation's future will always be bright and promising, and that no resistance can stop our renaissance. I, Chiang Kai-shek, have dedicated myself to the revolution, experienced countless hardships, and led the war of resistance for more than eight years. I absolutely cannot allow the life of the Republic of China, which has been exchanged for the blood and sacrifice of countless soldiers and civilians, to be easily destroyed. I cannot bear to cause further suffering to the people who have survived the war, nor will I change my established steps of seeking peaceful unification and democracy due to any provocation or obstruction. I will surely follow my conscience, fulfill my duty, and lead my compatriots throughout the country to advance towards the road of national construction in accordance with procedures and established practices. I express my sincere wishes to my compatriots on the occasion of today's commemoration, and I deeply hope that we will be of one mind and work hard to eliminate the disasters of our country, preserve the lifeline of our nation, and jointly complete the great cause of revolution and national construction." (Respectfully recorded from Chairman Chiang's Message to the Nation)

### To Awaken and to Build the Nation

Today is the anniversary of the victory of the War of Resistance. As we commemorate this day, we feel boundless excitement and boundless sorrow. The pain of our country's decades of suffering from enemy aggression has been completely washed away since this day last year. Our nation has joined the ranks of the five great powers, which truly makes us feel infinitely excited. I remember last year when I received the news of Japan's surrender in Chongqing, how many people were cheering and rejoicing, all wanting to return to their hometowns as soon as possible and reunite with their families. Everyone was looking forward to a happy life after peace. However, a year has passed since the victory, and many people are still drifting abroad, their hardships and suffering greater than during the war. Thinking about it is truly heartbreaking.

After the victory, in order to seek a reasonable political solution, safeguard the fruits of victory, enable the people to recuperate and rebuild, and complete the great cause of national construction as soon as possible, Chairman Chiang convened consultations and signed the Summary of the Double Tenth Negotiations. Later, he convened the Political Consultative Conference to consult various opinions. The government, making the greatest concessions, completed the Consultative Conference, promulgated the Program for National Reconstruction, signed the Plan for Military Reorganization, and agreed on measures to restore transportation. After a year of consultation, written agreements have been signed one after another, but what is the actual situation? If we do not implement them conscientiously, we will squander the fruits of victory and betray the millions of soldiers and civilians who sacrificed themselves for the War of Resistance. How can we be worthy of our friendly nations who sincerely assisted us!

"A woman must insult herself before others insult her." We should deeply understand the meaning of this old saying. Half of the national humiliation of the past decades was due to aggression, and half was also due to self-humiliation. Our position in the international community declined day by day, unequal treaties were signed one after another, and we lived a semi-colonial life. The Japanese further advanced step by step, finally creating the July 7th Incident, wanting to achieve their goal of destroying our entire country in one fell swoop. At that time, I was responsible for military and political affairs in Beiping. Following the instructions of the central government, I negotiated with the Japanese on the principle of not ceding sovereignty or humiliating the country. Unfortunately, Japan's policy of destroying our country was already established, and all methods could not achieve peace. Therefore, I led the troops to resist first. The whole country fought a bloody war for eight years and finally won the final victory. This June, I was ordered to travel east to testify. Seeing those war criminals who bullied us nine years ago made us feel infinite excitement and emotion. Of course, Japan had a predetermined plan and steps to invade us. If our whole country could have been united and worked hard in the past to resist foreign aggression, would the September 18th Incident and the July 7th Incident have occurred? It is worthy of research. If people from all walks of life could have worked together after our victory in the War of Resistance to jointly build the nation, at the very least, the country would not be in its current state.

I recently traveled in Japan and heard that Japan may recover even faster than us. I feel infinite worry in my heart. If we work together to build the nation, we are still afraid that we will not be able to catch up. If we create obstacles ourselves and undermine each other, when will we be able to catch up with the progress of this great era? Now we have the materials we have received and the assistance of the Allied nations. It is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to rejuvenate and build the nation. How can we bear to sit idly by and give it up?

I have always advocated peaceful unification because the people are too poor and cannot withstand war. The economy and society are scarred and cannot withstand war even more. The government has this basic understanding, so it spares no effort to seek peace and insists on resolving disputes through political means. This should be the case from the standpoint of the nation and the people. From the standpoint of the various parties, there is only a way to follow this peaceful path. Everyone is shouting for the country and for the nation. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, everyone could unite for the country. Why can't they cooperate after the victory?

The basic requirements of the people are to live and work in peace. Looking back over the past decades, how many days of peace and happiness have there been? Aren't these decades of chaos enough to teach us a lesson? After the First World War, we lost a good opportunity to regain Korea. Do we still want the country to be invaded and occupied again and the people to be massacred? The people are the true masters of the country. We must respect the interests of the people in order to strive for the survival of the country. After eight years of hard fighting, the people should rest and recuperate. We need peace, we need to build the nation, and we must not miss the opportunity again, causing harm to our descendants. I hope that everyone will wake up, grasp reality, be vigilant, and put the interests of the nation and the people above all else. Under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, we will jointly complete the mission of national construction, so as not to be ashamed of commemorating this great day.

Crime During the Concession Era

### Shanghai's Security is Improving After the Victory

— Shi

Shanghai's high number and complexity of criminal cases during the concession era were unparalleled among domestic cities and rare even abroad. Bruce, the Chief Inspector of the Shanghai Municipal Police of the former Public Concession, stated in the first issue of the 1928 London Police Journal that Shanghai's rising Chinese nationalism, poor domestic security, and the lack of isolation between the concession and other areas made the frequency of crime and the difficulty of police work even greater than in England. In fact, the rise of Chinese nationalism had nothing to do with the amount of crime. The number of criminal cases in Nanjing and Hangzhou in the interior was far less than in Shanghai at the time; security was much better than in Shanghai. Only the unequal treaty system was the fundamental reason for Shanghai's high and complex crime rate in the past.

1. Consular jurisdiction protected many international career criminals. In his "Shanghai: Paradise of Adventurers," Eddie Miller described many international career criminals who were expelled from other countries, had nowhere to go, and could easily land in Shanghai and continue their criminal careers. Many diplomats, pastors, and bankers made a living by issuing fake passports, selling arms and opium, manufacturing gambling equipment, and protecting casinos, fraud, and murder. Chinese law could not prevent or punish these crimes, and they were protected by the tangible and intangible consular jurisdiction.

2. The existence of the concession system fragmented Shanghai's police power, increased the convenience of criminals escaping, and increased the difficulty of criminal police work. As stated in "The Concessions and China's Destiny," the concession "was a country within China." In the past, Shanghai had two different "countries" at the same time in addition to the Shanghai Municipal Government: the Public Concession and the French Concession. For example, if a crime was committed on Dongdaming Road in the Public Concession, the criminal could cross the street south to Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, and the constables of the Public Concession could not arrest him. If a crime was committed in a Chinese shop next to the extraterritorial road, the Chinese police could not exercise police power once the criminal stepped out of the door onto the road. This deformed and unreasonable system only provided the greatest convenience and encouragement to criminals and gave those responsible for security a cruel mockery and insurmountable difficulties.

3. The colonial rule method is the best breeding ground for crime. The concession authorities only paid attention to military and economic control and ignored the organization (population was never statistically recorded), education, social life, welfare, and moral guidance of the vast majority of Chinese people in the concession. The unlimited development of opium dens, casinos, prostitution, and speculative commerce was intentionally or unintentionally allowed, which destroyed the old morality of society, made the people increasingly corrupt and degenerate, and cultivated countless criminal factors. In such a society, reducing crime is like climbing a tree to catch fish.

4. Past crime statistics (based on the Shanghai Municipal Council's annual report records, the French Concession and the Municipal Public Security Bureau's records are incomplete and omitted)

A. Total number of criminal cases

1937: 19,558 cases
1938: 19,064 cases
1939: 27,848 cases
1940: 30,980 cases
1941: 26,024 cases
Average annual: 20,469 cases, average monthly: 1,706 cases

B. Kidnapping (including completed and attempted)

1940: 80 cases
Average annual: 66 cases, average monthly: 5.5 cases

C. Robbery

1938: 684 cases
1939: 1,233 cases
1940: 2,275 cases
1941: 1,428 cases
1941: 52 cases
Average annual: 1,405 cases, average monthly: 117 cases

D. Theft

1937: 13,238 cases
1938: 12,723 cases
1939: 17,572 cases
Average annual: 14,511 cases, average monthly: 1,209 cases

(At that time, the population of the Public Concession accounted for about two-thirds of the total population of Shanghai, and currently accounts for half of the total population of Shanghai)

Current Security Situation

The entire Shanghai was recovered starting from September 12 of last year. The concessions and consular jurisdiction that were produced under 100 years of unequal treaties no longer exist. At the same time, the Shanghai security authorities have also shouldered unprecedentedly important responsibilities. The eight years of war of resistance and destruction by the enemy and puppets have caused Shanghai's material and spiritual aspects to suffer unprecedented losses. In addition, at the beginning of the recovery, factories have not fully resumed operation, unemployment has increased, the currency has changed, and the cost of living has not fallen. During the repatriation period, there were many scattered soldiers and deserters, and firearms scattered among the people have not yet been registered. The mentality of some people in Shanghai is that, on the one hand, they are too eager for governance, have too high expectations, and demand perfection. On the other hand, the remaining incorrect prejudices from the past have not been completely abandoned. Therefore, the security in the first six months after the initial recovery only sought stability and only managed to ensure that the number of crimes did not exceed the number of crimes during the concession era. After half a year, the record of criminal cases has gradually decreased and returned to normal. Not only is it less than in the past, but it is also much less than at the beginning of the recovery.

(1) Total number of criminal cases (from September 12 of last year to the end of August of this year): 19,394 cases

(2) Kidnapping (from October of last year to the end of August of this year): 15 cases occurred, 17 cases solved (including 2 cases solved that occurred in neighboring counties)

(3) Robbery

October 34: 118 cases, November: 142 cases, December: 131 cases
January 35: 106 cases, February: 92 cases, March: 88 cases
Average monthly for the first six months after the recovery: 113 cases

April 35: 101 cases, May: 75 cases, June: 81 cases, July: 63 cases, August: 32 cases
Average monthly for the five months after half a year: 70 cases, the least in August, 110 cases less than the highest in November of last year

(4) Theft

October 34: 100 cases, November: 1342 cases, December: 1447 cases
January 35: 1254 cases, February: 813 cases, March: 1030 cases
Average monthly for the first six months after the recovery: 1149 cases

April 35: 1019 cases, May: 980 cases, June: 861 cases, July: 731 cases, August: 571 cases
Average monthly for the five months after half a year: 832 cases (theft accounted for 39.25% of all repeat offenders and 70.27% of habitual offenders)

(5) Criminals apprehended (from September 12 of last year to the end of August):

23 kidnappers, 347 robbers
4669 thieves, 1856 opium addicts

(According to statistics from the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau)

Representatives of the Japanese Surrender

(1) General Yasuji Okamura (fourth from right), Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army stationed in China. (2) Lieutenant General Asasaburo Kobayashi (third from right), Chief of Staff of the Japanese Army. (3) Vice Admiral Ryosaburo Fukuda (fifth from right), Commander of the Japanese Fleet. (4) Takeo Imai (second from right). (5) Sawayama (sixth from right). (6) Kiyoshi Ogasawara (first from right). (7) Masao Misawa (seventh from right).

### Review and Outlook on Criminal Cases

1. From the two types of statistics above, those of the former Public Concession and the current Municipal Police Bureau, I get the following two concepts:

(1) The current number of crimes in the entire Shanghai is only equivalent to one district of the former Public Concession.

(2) Important criminal crimes are now less than in one district of the Public Concession and are tending to decrease month by month.

2. The reasons are nothing more than:

(1) Complete police power reduces the difficulty of work and makes it difficult for criminals to escape.

(2) Unified command of the military and police strengthens effectiveness.

(3) Heavy penalties for bandits make criminals afraid to try easily.

(4) Social life is more serious than during the concession era, reducing criminal factors.

3. However, Shanghai society has been affected by 100 years of unequal treaties. A few people's residual lifestyles and psychology have not been completely forgotten for a while. The inevitable difficulties after the war cannot be completely resolved in a short time. At the same time, the security organs after the recovery still have many areas that must be improved in terms of strength, equipment, technology, personnel training, discipline, and quality. On the other hand, it is not enough to reduce crime only through passive legal sanctions. There must be an active advocacy of the rule of law in society, and further cooperation and sympathy with the security organs can ensure future security. Only when Shanghai's security can be stabilized can Shanghai embark on the path of proper prosperity and construction.

### Judges of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East

The International Military Tribunal for the Far East held a public trial of 28 major Japanese war criminals. The judges attending included those from China, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, France, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, New Zealand, and the Philippines. The photo shows the judges of various countries taking their seats. The third person on the right is Mr. Mei Ru'ao, the judge from China attending the court.

### Japanese War Crimes

— This Newspaper Archives

They all committed a series of bloody crimes. The people of the United Nations, for the painful lessons of the past and to lay the foundation for world peace in the future, must settle this blood debt with them from beginning to end!

It has been a year since the victory. Looking back on the past eight years—no, fourteen years, or even fifty-two years—the old accounts of the Japanese militarists' invasion of China, in today's painful reflection, must undoubtedly be thoroughly settled with these instigators of war.

Starting from the September 18th Incident, these war criminals, Araki, Doihara, Konoe, Matsui, Hashimoto, Tojo, Koiso… harboring ambitions to invade China and the world, successively created countless incidents: the Rehe Incident, the January 28th Incident, the Inner Mongolia Incident, the Tanggu Truce, the He-Umezu Agreement, the Zhangbei Incident, the Fengtai Incident, the Lugouqiao Incident, the August 13th Incident, the Nanjing Massacre, massacres in various parts of central and southern China, the Zhanggufeng Incident, the Pearl Harbor Incident, until the full-scale outbreak of the Pacific War. During the war, how many more crimes did they commit—policies of massacre, policies of poisoning, policies of corruption, looting of grain and materials, establishing puppet governments… these bloody facts brought extreme anger and terror to people all over the world.

After Japan surrendered last August, the Chinese authorities had already decided on the disposition of Japanese war criminals. According to the surrender report of the General Headquarters of the Chinese Army, it was stipulated that Japanese war criminals in China should be investigated and arrested by the Chief Executives of each marching headquarters and war zone, according to the list issued by the Military Affairs Commission. Those who had returned to Japan were to be requested by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to have the US government order the Supreme Commander of the US occupying forces to arrest and hand them over. Captured war criminals were to be held in war criminal detention centers in various districts and tried by military tribunals. So far, hundreds of people, including Kumaichi Yamanaka and Takashi Sakai, have been arrested and tried; several people, including Tameichi Isoya and Hisao Tani, have been handed over to our country by the US military.

After General MacArthur led the US military to land in Japan, he immediately ordered the arrest of Japanese war criminals, including Doihara, Koiso, and Hiranuma. On May 3rd of this year, the United Nations International Tribunal opened in Tokyo, with the Chief Prosecutor being Keenan (US), and the prosecutors being Xiang Zherong (China), Jarr (UK), Golunsky (USSR), Mansfield (Australia), Nolan (Canada), Audo (France), Mulder (Netherlands), Quillin (New Zealand), Menon, and Jarr (India), and Lopez (Philippines), totaling eleven people. These war criminals, whose crimes deserved more than just execution, were charged with launching wars of aggression, violating international treaties, enslaving and abusing the people of other countries, and colluding with Nazi fascist war criminals, and were subjected to detailed interrogations. In repeated trials, the conspiracy of Japan's aggression against the East Asian continent over the years was further exposed.

Please note the following: the war criminals on trial have shown no remorse! They have even questioned the jurisdiction of the International Tribunal, they still believe that the responsible authorities of a country should not be regarded as war criminals internationally, and they even claimed that the atomic bombing was a "more heinous murder"!

Another noteworthy fact: to date, not all Japanese war criminals have been tried by the Tokyo International Tribunal, and many are still freely holding public office and engaging in political activities. Moreover, the International Tribunal has not yet tried a single Japanese zaibatsu, and these zaibatsu are precisely the instigators of Japanese aggression.

We must pay attention to this group of war criminals who have slipped through the net, and must completely arrest them, subject them to the sanctions of the United Nations, and not let one of them escape.

Today, on the anniversary of the victory, we will only make public the crimes of these important war criminals before the people of China and the world:—

### A Sign of Defeat: Hideki Tojo

The mastermind of the Pacific War, Japanese Prime Minister Hideki Tojo, attempted suicide on September 10th of last year but failed and is now confined in Omori Prison, where he continues to be tried in the United Nations Tribunal.

Tojo has always been praised as a practitioner of the "Hakko Ichiu" spirit. From 1935 to 1936, he served as commander of the Kwantung Army Gendarmerie and chief of staff of the Kwantung Army in Northeast China. When Konoe formed his cabinet, Tojo became Vice Minister of the Army, then Minister of the Army. On December 2, 1942, he took the stage to form a cabinet, serving as Prime Minister and Minister of the Army. On December 7th of the same month, he launched the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor and issued a declaration of war against Britain and the United States overnight, until he resigned in July 1944 after the Pacific War turned unfavorable. During this time, he also served as Minister of Home Affairs, Minister of Munitions, and Chief of the General Staff.

In summary, the major crimes he committed during his tenure as Prime Minister include: first and foremost, invading Britain and the United States and launching the Pacific War. He also organized the Imperial General Headquarters and personally led the army, navy, and air force to direct overall operations. Second, he used the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere as a slogan to entice the Wang Jingwei regime and the "Manchukuo," as well as puppet organizations in India, Burma, Thailand, and Vietnam, to declare war on Britain and the United States. Third, he colluded with Germany and Italy to endanger world peace. Finally, he established large-scale invasion institutions in China and massacred our people. During the ongoing trial at the Tokyo International Tribunal, evidence was presented regarding Tojo's orders to mistreat prisoners of war; his circular to various concentration camps stated: "Do not be easily swayed by humanitarianism or personal feelings towards prisoners of war. All prisoners must be strictly disciplined. Give prisoners what they deserve, so that the Japanese people can recognize the excellent character of the Japanese nation and the special rights and glory enjoyed by the Japanese nation." Such inhumane and absurd remarks are outrageous!

Due to Tojo's aggressive militarism and launching of wars, he sent the Japanese people to the battlefield as cannon fodder, which ultimately led Japan to a state of utter defeat and irretrievable disaster. Therefore, today's Tojo will not only be severely sanctioned by the United Nations, but the Japanese people should also rise up to settle his crimes!

### The Number One Demon: Kenji Doihara

Unveiling the historical materials of the Japanese invaders' invasion of China over the past fifteen years, Doihara is truly the chief culprit. In the guise of a militarist henchman, he was the first to launch an armed invasion of China. In September 1931, he served as the head of the Special Service Agency in Northeast China and, together with Itagaki and others, created the Mukden Incident, using force to occupy Northeast China, creating a "Kingly Way Paradise" and implementing the so-called "Enlightenment Reform in Northeast China," and establishing the puppet state of Manchukuo. At that time, the behind-the-scenes wire-puller for Puyi was none other than this Kenji Doihara.

Doihara was the organizer of the intelligence network on the Asian continent. After the Japanese army forcibly occupied Rehe and established a puppet regime in Inner Mongolia, Doihara crossed the Great Wall and went south to launch a huge conspiracy to invade North China. In March 1933, the Japanese army occupied Rehe, and in April, they challenged and attacked various passes of our Great Wall. In May, they pressed on Tianjin, resulting in the establishment of the "Tanggu Truce." In June 1935, the so-called "Zhangbei Incident" was caused by Japanese officers and soldiers forcibly passing through Zhangjiakou. Afterwards, the Doihara-Qin Dechun Agreement was signed, driving out the central forces of Chahar and supporting Prince De. This was followed by the Fengtai Incident in September 1936. Doihara took one step further and plotted to establish a "North China Autonomous Government," trying to entice our generals to become chairmen of the "North China Autonomous Government," promising assistance regarding the military and economy of North China, but we refused. Doihara then exerted strong pressure on the Hebei-Chahar Political Council. On the one hand, he enticed Yin Rugeng to organize the "Hebei-East Anti-Communist Autonomous Committee," with himself as the supreme advisor. As a result of repeated oppression, the Lugouqiao Incident finally broke out, and a full-scale war of resistance began.

Before July 7th, all smuggling, drug trafficking, and forced labor in the Pingjin area were the work of Doihara. He monopolized all special forces in North China, and no traitor was not under his command. After the outbreak of the war, he also carried out vicious massacres in the capacity of commander of the 5th Army Corps. From 1940 to 1943, he served as a supreme military councilor, and later served as the director-general of the Army Aviation, commander-in-chief of the Eastern Army of Japan, commander-in-chief of the 7th Area Army in Singapore, and director-general of Army Education. Each time Japan invaded China and opened up new battlefields, Doihara arranged the invasion conspiracy in advance, so he is truly the number one demon among war criminals.

Such a demon should naturally no longer be allowed to roam free. When the United Nations issued its first list of wanted war criminals, Doihara had no choice but to surrender and go to prison.

Doihara is Japan's "Himmler" and Northeast China's "Lawrence." Now that the day of thorough reckoning has arrived, we must interrogate him about all the spy conspiracy cells he has deployed in our country and ruthlessly eliminate them.

### Massacre Culprit: Iwane Matsui

Iwane Matsui was the person in charge of the heinous atrocities committed by the Japanese army in Nanjing. It is estimated that the Japanese army committed more than 20,000 cases of rape in Nanjing at that time. More than 12,000 innocent Chinese civilians were slaughtered, and countless cases of drug trafficking and open robbery occurred. Such bestial acts are truly appalling.

Matsui is now also on trial in the Tokyo International Tribunal. He is still trying to evade responsibility for the Nanjing Incident, claiming: "I believe that the discipline of the Japanese army is very good!" But the public law is clear, and the responsibility that a murderer should bear can be predicted.

Matsui has always been a person with favorable connections in the Japanese army, advocating the Asia Association and forming his own faction. He is familiar with the situation in our country and speaks the language, and is a famous China expert. In 1931, he attended the Geneva Conference as a representative of the Japanese army. In 1933, he served as a supreme military councilor. In 1934, he also visited China to promote his "Pan-Asianism." When the war broke out in 1937, Matsui was transferred to China and commanded the war in Shanghai. The Nanjing Massacre was his "achievement" after he captured Nanjing! At this time, he had been appointed commander-in-chief of the Central China Expeditionary Army, from October 1937 to February 1938.

After returning to Japan, he also advocated "Asian Monroeism" and served as an advisor to the Cabinet, advisor to the Asia League, advisor to the Greater Political Assistance Society's East Asia Affairs Department, and president of the East Asia Development Company.

The once-commanding leader of the "Imperial Army," before bowing to the International Tribunal, has he ever thought about where his former prestige is now?

### The Korean Cowardly Tiger: Kuniaki Koiso

The so-called "Korean Tiger" Kuniaki Koiso is a rising pro-war militarist in Japan. Before 1930, he was still an unimportant supporting role in the group of Japanese militarists. In 1932, he colluded with Doihara, Honjo Shigeru, and Itagaki to invade our Northeast China, and was suddenly appointed as the "Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army." After leaving office in 1934, he was transferred to serve as the Commander-in-Chief of the Korean Army for two years. Afterwards, he served as Minister of Colonial Affairs in the Hiranuma Cabinet and the Yonai Cabinet. In 1942, when the situation in the Pacific became critical, he took office as the Governor-General of Korea, suppressing the Korean patriotic movement, training Korean youths, and forcing them to fight for Japan. His vigorous and resolute actions gained the attention of the Japanese government, hence the name "Korean Tiger."

When Japan suffered setbacks in the Pacific War and the Tojo cabinet collapsed, Koiso came forward to "accept the mandate and form a cabinet." In his first interview with reporters on the day he formed his cabinet, he said: "In order to achieve the final victory in the war, the Yamato race must cooperate in wartime between the command and the national affairs. The power of the command is higher than everything else, in order to promote national policy." In the Pacific War, he abused the Kamikaze attack teams and mobilized all officers and soldiers to make a desperate gamble. In the war against China, he always harbored the ambition to attack the capital, Chongqing, while forcing small and weak nations such as India, Burma, Thailand, and Vietnam to get involved in the war, and looting abundant resources in Southeast Asia to provide huge expenses for the war.

But Koiso's "efforts" were ultimately ineffective, and instead led Japan more quickly into a "dead end." The Japanese army encountered strong resistance from the Allied forces in the Pacific, and the military suffered repeated defeats. The Koiso cabinet had to announce its resignation in April 1945.

What else does this "Korean Tiger" have to say in court today?

### Standard Militarism: Sadao Araki

Sadao Araki, the culprit of the Northeast Incident, is a standard Japanese militarist who advocates aggressive militarism. In 1931, he served as the Director of the General Affairs Bureau of the Army General Staff Headquarters. In December 1931, he took office as the Minister of the Army in the Inukai Cabinet and plotted the Northeast Incident. According to Araki's testimony in the International Tribunal: "After I took office as Minister of the Army, I studied the policy of occupying the four provinces to solve the Manchurian problem. With the approval of the Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, and Finance Minister, it was decided that the Prime Minister would seek the approval of the Privy Council. The Cabinet then resolved to 'pacify' the territory of Zhang Xueliang!" His conspiracy is evident.

In the Saito Cabinet, Araki continued to serve as Minister of the Army. In 1932, he presided over the signing of the Japan-"Manchukuo" Protocol. Emperor Hirohito also personally attended the meeting.

In 1933, he was promoted to Army General. From 1934 to 1936, he served as a supreme military councilor, and the following year, he served as an advisor to the Cabinet's Committee on China Affairs, openly interfering in our country's internal affairs. In the Konoe Cabinet and the Hiranuma Cabinet, he served as Minister of Education, controlling everything. His power was higher than that of the Prime Minister, and he was virtually one of the leaders of Japanese fascism. In 1940, he also served as an advisor to the Cabinet.

Araki is not only an extreme hater of communism, but also the most powerful figure in anti-Soviet activities. From 1918 to 1922, when Japan intervened in the Far East, he presided over the espionage work in the Soviet territory of the Far East.

After the Allied forces landed in Japan, Araki and Shimada were arrested by General MacArthur at the same time. When the International Tribunal opened, it had already investigated and clarified Araki's past crimes of invading Northeast China, Inner Mongolia, and North China. It is expected that a verdict will be reached soon.

### Star of a Hundred Defeats: Shunroku Hata

Most of the famous Japanese militarists have served in the Northeast. Shunroku Hata is also one of the members of the "Northeast militarist clique." He graduated from the Army Military Academy and was skilled in the art of "general swordsmanship." In 1933, he served as a division commander in the three northeastern provinces. In 1935, he served as the Director of the Army Aviation Bureau. After the February 26th Incident in Japan, Terauchi Hisaichi was responsible for purifying the army, Araki Sadao stepped down, and Yanagawa Heisuke succeeded him as Minister of the Army. Hata and Yanagawa were classmates at the Army University, so he was appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the Taiwan Army. From then on, he had smooth sailing and was sent to China twice, serving as the Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary Army.

Hata Shunroku testified in the International Tribunal: "I succeeded General Matsui as the Commander-in-Chief of the Central China Expeditionary Army from February to November 1938, and succeeded General Nishio as the Commander-in-Chief of the China Expeditionary Army from 1941 to 1944. After Matsui captured Nanjing, my main purpose was to 'pacify' the occupied areas."

Hata Shunroku came to China twice to command operations and encountered fierce resistance from our army, suffering huge losses. He instigated his subordinates to slaughter our people everywhere in order to vent their anger. In the Yellow River, the Yangtze River, Central China, and Southern China, the great bloodshed of the Chinese people created an extremely cruel page in history.

During the time that Hata Shunroku came to China twice, he was once reassigned as the Minister of the Army in the Abe Cabinet. He sent General Nishio Shuzo to China to fight and launched the so-called "October Offensive," using the strength of seven divisions to attack Changsha fiercely. Who knew that they would be deeply trapped and defeated under Mount Mufu, with more than half of them killed. Nishio was therefore dismissed, and Hata had to resign from his position as Minister of the Army.

### Double War Criminal: Teiichi Suzuki

Teiichi Suzuki, who is being tried in the United Nations International Tribunal this time, is a double war criminal of the United Nations. He launched the war of aggression against China and participated in launching the Pacific War. His crimes are truly too numerous to count.

Suzuki is one of the vanguards of the Japanese young officers. In December 1938, he came to China to serve as the Director of the Political Affairs Department of the Asia Development Board, and once served as the acting Director-General of the Board until the Asia Development Board was dissolved in April 1941.

After the Asia Development Board was abolished, Suzuki returned to Japan. From 1941 to January 1943, he successively served as the Director-General of the Planning Board and Minister without Portfolio in the Konoe Cabinet and the Tojo Cabinet, participating in the planning of the war against Britain and the United States. In 1944, he also served as an advisor to the Cabinet and a director of the Great Japan Political Assistance Society. After the victory, he surrendered and went to prison.

### The Cost of Japan's War of Aggression

According to the recent investigation report of the First and Second Demobilization Committees: Japan lost 1,174,476 military personnel in the eight-year war of aggression, including 777,076 army personnel and 397,400 naval personnel. Among the army deaths, 725,076 were killed in action, and 52,000 drowned. Among the naval deaths, 280 died in the China war zone, and 397,120 died in the Pacific war zone. (United Press)

After the July 7th Incident, all Chinese people were united in their hatred of the enemy. Under the leadership of the supreme leader, they fought a long-term war of resistance. The picture shows the National Army marching to the front line to defend the motherland amidst the enthusiastic farewells of the people.

The elite troops of the National Army fought hard on various battlefields for eight years, using their flesh and blood to fight against the superior enemy forces, inspiring and encouraging each other to strive for victory and complete the foundation of national construction.

During the War of Resistance, outstanding youths joined the Air Force for training.

During the War of Resistance, the enemy, in its occupied areas, committed countless atrocities such as rape, plunder, arson, killing, robbery, and seizure. The victory won by countless bloodstains should be doubled our efforts in the future in order to be worthy of these many martyrs and heroic soldiers who died in battle.

Unforgettable "Blood Debt"!

During the War of Resistance, the martyrs who sacrificed under the bayonets and sabers of the enemy have now received their due.

Major cities in the rear were subjected to fierce bombing by enemy planes, resulting in heavy losses, but because we have such a strong will, we have achieved today's victory.

### Preparations and Prospects for the Shanghai Stock Market

— Du Yong

In the summer of the 35th year of the Republic (1946), the government, recognizing the prevalence of speculation in Shanghai and the lack of legitimate channels for idle capital, resolved to establish the Shanghai Stock Market. In early June, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs jointly appointed nine individuals, namely Wang Zhixin, Gu Shanchang, Yu Huanzheng, Xu Jilong, Xu Weiming, Qu Jigang, Xia Pingfang, Qian Yongming, and myself, to form the Preparatory Committee for the Shanghai Stock Exchange. I was designated as the Chairman and Mr. Wang Zhixin as the Vice Chairman. The committee was established on the 4th of the month and held its first meeting. To gather diverse perspectives and facilitate collaboration, several subcommittees were established: "Regulations and Qualification Review for Brokers," "Standards for Listed Securities and Review of Listed Securities," "Formulation of Regulations for Securities Trading," and "Preparations for the Resumption of the Stock Exchange." In addition to the committee members' participation, experts were invited as advisors. The progress of their work is briefly described below:

(1) Regarding broker applications, a public announcement was made, and the application process began on July 9th, ending on the 21st. The subcommittee first reviewed the applications and then presented them to the full committee. Based on three criteria—education, experience, and financial strength—the committee verified the documents, paying close attention to the applicant's reputation and the organization and current status of their firm. After several meetings, a list of qualified applicants, along with their documents, was submitted to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval.

(2) For the review of listed securities, a public announcement was made to accept applications. The subcommittee reviewed each application based on its balance sheet, registration procedures, and other relevant matters. The full committee then made a decision and submitted it for approval.

(3) The formulation of various rules for securities trading was based on the current regulations of domestic and foreign exchanges, relevant laws, and the situation in Shanghai. The subcommittee drafted the rules, which were then submitted to the full committee for approval. The aim was to ensure compliance with the law and alignment with the facts, to improve the standards of the securities industry and to adhere to the principles of curbing speculation.

(4) The Shanghai Stock Exchange already existed under Chinese merchants. During the period of enemy occupation, it was utilized, but the capital scope was very small. Therefore, the committee was ordered to prepare the market and establish the Shanghai Stock Exchange, with a capital of 1 billion yuan. The original Chinese shareholders subscribed for 60% of the shares, and the remaining shares were taken up by the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, the China Credit Bureau, and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau. The existing market of Chinese merchants was expanded and rebuilt into both a bond and a stock market, with stocks traded on the ground floor and bonds on the mezzanine. The third floor housed the offices.

Furthermore, the Ministry ordered an early resumption of business, the task was urgent and complex, but difficulties were overcome. On September 3rd, the inaugural meeting of the Shanghai Stock Exchange was held, announcing its establishment. The work and mission of the Preparatory Committee came to an end. Subsequently, the work was handed over to the exchange. I had the honor of chairing the Preparatory Committee, from the time I was ordered to prepare the exchange until the establishment of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, a total of three months. Thanks to the guidance of President Song (Ziwen) and the efforts of all the committee members in the review of all projects and regulations, this only stock market in China was fortunately completed. This is the story of the preparation. Securities are closely related to finance, and their interests are intertwined. This is even more evident in the development of modern financial business. The method of circulation is simple, and the procedure of safekeeping is convenient. Furthermore, the issuance of national bonds and the expansion and contraction of currency have an indirect and increasing impact on the national financial economy. Therefore, all countries attach great importance to the stock market, as its organization and management can affect the soundness of finance and indirectly affect the government's economic policies. Thus, its mission and responsibility are extremely important. The Shanghai market was the origin of securities in China. Individuals advanced to group organizations, and then a stock market was established. The Shanghai market is relatively complete. Because Shanghai is the financial center of the country, it is most necessary to utilize this market. Therefore, from 1919 to 1937, the former Chinese Stock Exchange market underwrote public bonds exceeding hundreds of millions. However, the importance of the stock market lies not only in the sale of bonds, but also in promoting the circulation of industrial and commercial stocks. In the past, the Chinese people's concept of investing in stocks was based on family and friendship, and the organizers were limited by their own interests. The accounting and auditing systems were not perfect, so the scope of the organization was not expanded, and stock circulation was not easy to gain trust. Currently, the total capital of industrial and commercial enterprises is hundreds of millions, the organization is becoming increasingly perfect, the accounting is striving for accuracy, and the style of raising capital has changed to become more open. The establishment of the Shanghai Stock Exchange this time was carried out in accordance with the law. Those who apply for listing are also enthusiastic. On the one hand, more and more people are investing in stocks, which shows that the concepts and interests of the public have changed. The establishment of the stock portion of the stock market is a matter of urgency. Therefore, in the current outlook, investors should carefully select to determine their choices, the organizers should be frank and diligent to promote their business, and the exchange should strictly enforce its laws and regulations with an impartial attitude, in order to guide investment and prevent speculation, so that the circulation of bonds and stocks is unimpeded, and the three parties each fulfill their duties, then the future of China's stock market can be gradually perfected.

### Letter to Colleagues at the Shanghai Stock Exchange

— Wang Zhixin

After the Shanghai Stock Exchange was ordered to prepare, I followed Chairman Du (Yong) and, with the cooperation of all colleagues, was able to witness the official opening today. Now, I am mistakenly entrusted with the concurrent position of General Manager by the recommendation of Chairman Du. I am very pleased to have the opportunity to work together with the majority of colleagues whom I did not know in the past!

The stock exchange is one of the most important institutions in the financial sector. Its task is to establish a modern capital market to guide social capital into the right channels, to assist national economic construction, and to develop industrial and commercial enterprises. Therefore, the responsibility is extremely important, and its success or failure has a huge impact. I have always devoted myself to the banking business and have been unfamiliar with the business of the stock exchange. I am deeply aware of the fear of treading on thin ice with this heavy responsibility, and I have to place high hopes on all colleagues.

Colleagues will take this post as a lifelong career, and first of all, we must clearly understand the mission of this exchange, and then improve our concept of serving this exchange. In the past, the society had some misunderstandings about the purpose of the stock exchange, mistaking investment for speculation, and only knowing how to benefit themselves and ignoring the social impact. Employees, influenced by what they saw and heard, often misused the convenience of their positions and followed the trend, thus mistakenly believing that serving this exchange was to gain an advantageous position. It is hoped that this kind of erroneous concept will disappear with time. We should link our personal honor, disgrace, interests and damage with the rise and fall of the service organization. At the beginning of the new life of this exchange, we must lay a noble and pure service belief in our minds.

Since we are serving in this exchange, we should abide by the discipline of this exchange and be loyal to our respective duties. Colleagues should be able to understand this meaning without explanation. However, how to cultivate a good custom of abiding by discipline and being responsible should start from a strict life. Only those who live a strict life can have a healthy mind and improve their talents. Only those with a healthy mind can abide by discipline, and only those who can constantly improve their talents can be responsible. This point must be understood and practiced by colleagues. I will set an example by myself. At the same time, I will gradually promote measures that should be taken to ensure the stable life of the colleagues in this exchange to the best of my ability. Some of the colleagues are employed from the former Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange, and some are selected through examinations or recruited from various parties. They all have many years of experience in serving the society and will be able to perform their duties happily. With such a neat lineup, operating this meaningful business, I believe we will not fail the expectations of the government and the society. However, colleagues must work together, unite and cooperate, and eliminate the distinction between old and new, and the view of being separated, so that success can be achieved. This is what I hope colleagues should pay special attention to.

Although the colleagues of this exchange come from all parties, the selection and abandonment is absolutely based on talent. In the service process, the performance of work and the morality of service are the criteria for elimination and promotion. All those who have excellent work performance and a strict life, this exchange will guarantee that they can be secure in their position and hold their position for a long time. If they do not plan this way, but only seek to survive in personnel relations, the facts will surely deny us. Employing people with talent and ability will be the consistent policy of this exchange.

The organization of this exchange is temporarily divided into one office and four departments, namely, the Secretariat, the Business Department, the Finance Department, the Research and Investigation Department, and the General Affairs Department. Each department is divided into various sections, and all colleagues are distributed in various parts of the work, forming an organic whole. Although the responsibilities of each person are different in weight, the importance of each person's completion of their task is no different. We hope that each of us will stand on our posts, do our best, and work together to promote the business of this exchange to perfection.

At the beginning of my work with my colleagues, I would like to state a few hopes, which I would like to share with you!

### A Letter to Compatriots from All Walks of Life on the Occasion of the Opening of the Shanghai Stock Exchange

— Du Yong

To all compatriots from all walks of life:

By the order of President Song (Ziwen) and the ministers of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Finance, I, along with the gentlemen of the Shanghai Stock Market Preparatory Committee, have been preparing for the establishment of the Shanghai Stock Exchange for more than three months. The preparatory work is basically completed, and the shareholders' meeting has been convened in accordance with the law to elect directors and supervisors. I, Yong, am not talented and have been elected as the chairman of the board. I am afraid of falling short of expectations. Today, on the occasion of the opening, I would like to express my feelings to all compatriots from all walks of life.

The mission of this exchange is extremely important this time. The country has been in the Anti-Japanese War for many years, and everything is waiting to be rebuilt. The most important of all construction is the collection of funds. Under our country's economic national policy, the best way to collect funds is to issue securities through the modern stock market to absorb idle capital, and to use idle capital by buying and selling securities. Only in this way can entrepreneurs use social capital to increase their productivity; only in this way can investors measure their capital and needs, select and purchase securities, and sell them at any time without worrying about stagnation. The establishment of this exchange is to meet the needs of both parties and make contributions to the cause of national construction. This is the first.

At present, there is an overabundance of idle capital in the society, and there is no proper way out. Speculative frenzy and price fluctuations follow one after another, which has a profound and significant impact on people's livelihoods. After the opening of this exchange, we hope to sell idle capital and guide it into legitimate enterprises, so that the financial market can be stabilized and the livelihood of the people can be saved from distress. This is the second.

This time, the qualification of brokers and the assessment of securities in Shanghai are very strict, the internal organization and personnel are also very solemn, various rules and regulations are carefully formulated, and the scale of equipment is unique in the east. In the future, under strict management and correct leadership, we hope to strictly abide by government laws and regulations, establish a modern capital market mechanism, thereby promote national policy and benefit finance. This is the third.

The above three are the missions of this exchange. However, it is difficult to say it, and it is difficult to do it. To complete it, on the one hand, we rely on the efforts of the colleagues of this exchange, and on the other hand, we rely on the assistance of people from all walks of life. One must start low to climb high, and start near to travel far. At the beginning of the opening, I am overwhelmed with fear of walking on thin ice. If we can obtain the love and support of all compatriots, and achieve a brilliant future, it will not only be the good fortune of this exchange, but also the good fortune of the country and society. Du Yong, Chairman of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, respectfully informs you on September 9, 1946.

### How to Improve the Shanghai Stock Exchange Market

— Pan Shihao

One hundred and seventy-three years after the establishment of the London Stock Exchange on July 15, 1773, our Shanghai Stock Exchange is also ready and should be announced to open for business. It has been twenty-seven years since the establishment of the Shanghai Stock and Goods Exchange in 1919. During this period, the twists and turns of the exchange business, the complexity of the securities market collapse, and the rise and fall of the industrial and commercial circles, even a brief recollection, are full of emotions. And with the current deep industrial and commercial crisis, and the urgent need for funds to flow into the black market usury, the stock exchange is suitable for the opening of the market with great fanfare at this time, we really can't help but pay close attention to it. The first article of its articles of association reveals the purpose of its business, "To promote business investment, promote economic recovery, establish a sound stock market, and support industrial and commercial enterprises." The vision is far-reaching and deeply resonates with my heart. However, the established securities market must be sound before business investment can be promoted, industrial and commercial enterprises can be supported, and economic recovery can be promoted. Therefore, to put it simply, how should the stock exchange, as a stock market, pay attention to its soundness, so that it can be beneficial to the society and beneficial to the shareholders. We can't help but contribute our opinions.

First, the father's inheritance procedures must be regularized. The securities market is not necessarily the stock exchange. As long as there are securities, there will be transactions. However, the general trading procedures may endanger the market and hinder the society. Therefore, the Stock Exchange Law is formulated and the stock exchange is established to centralize and range it, and strive to make the buying, selling and delivery procedures conform to the law and suitable for the commercial situation. The exchange system is to correct the perfunctoriness and other abuses in trading with the spirit of the rule of law. Those who study the exchange system often praise the United Kingdom, because it was the earliest to create the business, the most developed, and the spirit of the rule of law is the most perfect. However, every time I read the history of the exchange, since the Roya Exchange in 1567, the trading procedures have been rectified many times. When the technology of Amsterdam was introduced and the fixed-term delivery was implemented, it was not able to enter the right track. And every time speculation was rampant, there was still much criticism. In 1697, the parliament even established a strict law to ban it, and then selected brokers and eliminated the scum. The unrestrained nature of the Change Alley road transaction, compared with the general lane transactions in our country, is difficult to control, and can be said to be the same in the East and the West. Those who have read Mrs. Centive's play "A. Bald Strake fora Wife" in 1717 will have a lot of aftertaste. It was not until 1773 that the London Stock Exchange was established in Sweeting's Alley, and then there was a concrete broker association and a sound trading system. As a result, the trading procedures gradually entered the right track, and there was the establishment of the new building of the Capel Court Exchange in 1801. However, it is still constantly improving and striving to make the trading procedures strictly disciplined. The advanced countries' exchange system has today's achievements, and its experience is like this. Our country has a shallow history of exchanges. Shanghai has been occupied, and how should the various shortcomings and immorality of black market transactions be renewed? It is really not easy. However, if we abandon this and do not plan, the foundation will not be established, and the consequences are worrying. But as the saying goes, knowing is difficult but not difficult, and it is necessary to constantly improve.

Second, the object of the transaction must be stabilized. There are many types of securities. Which one is beneficial to business investment, helpful to economic recovery, and effective in supporting industry and commerce? It is necessary to obtain its standards from the perspective of statistics with a far-sighted vision and a fair and just position. Then the inferior will not succeed, and the superior will be able to prosper. Here, we can't help but recall the United Kingdom again. In the 1690s, although stocks were issued, they failed to circulate in large quantities. In the next hundred years or so, more and more modernized enterprises emerged, stock investment became more and more popular, and exchange trading gradually focused on this. Its promotion of domestic production business is mutually reinforcing with the rise of the steam engine industry. However, the stock market is inevitably subject to frequent ups and downs. Multi-party and short-selling have been ups and downs, and the sacrifices are not small. The stock of the South Seas companies has been condemned by public opinion for its rise and plunge. In 1733, a law was enacted to strictly prohibit speculation. It can be seen that if the selection of the object of the transaction is not careful, the danger is like this. Although our country has a shallow history of exchanges, stock market trends have repeatedly occurred. We should not forget the rubber stocks in the late Qing Dynasty and the stock incident of this exchange around 1921. Those who preside over the stock exchange should know what to be vigilant about. As for public bonds, creditworthiness still needs to be strengthened, and circulation must be promoted. With the scarcity of our country's finances, if we abandon public bonds and focus on increasing taxes and issuing banknotes, it is not a good strategy. Therefore, for the sake of the entire nation, the stock exchange must do its best in public bond transactions. However, who should be responsible for the public bond trend at the end of June this year? To remove its drawbacks and establish its credibility, the stock exchange should give it a stern correction in the spirit of impartiality.

### The Reorganization of the Securities Industry Association

— Jingzhi

The Securities Industry Association of this city, in November last year, was ordered by the Bureau of Social Affairs to reorganize according to law. Chen Yongqing, Mo Xinglin, Zhou Wusan, Fu Weiyuan, Zhu Muzhen, Zhu Taiyao, Ruan Gongchun and other seven people were appointed as reorganization committee members. Chen Yongqing was elected as the standing committee member, and he began to register members, draft articles of association, and submit them to the Bureau of Social Affairs for approval. The first general meeting of members was convened on February 24 of this year. The articles of association were passed, and directors and supervisors were elected. A total of fifteen people, including Du Yuesheng, Yu Mingshi, Mo Xinglin, Zhou Wusan, Chen Yongqing, Yu Mingyue, Lin Legeng, Yu Huanzheng, Su Peishao, Zhou Hanqing, Wang Shuhe, Lin Zongjing, Shi Jiucai, Wei Meizhang and Qiu Lianggui, were elected as directors. Zheng Xiaozhou, Dong Laisun, Zhu Wuyu, Wu Shishen, Ruan Gongchun, Fu Weiyuan, Zheng Xuegao and other seven people were elected as supervisors. They took office on the spot, and the first meeting of the board of directors was held on March 1. Du Yuesheng, Yu Mingshi, Wang Shuhe, Mo Xinglin, Shi Jiucai and other five people were elected as standing directors. Later, Du resigned due to illness. At the second meeting of the board of directors on March 28, it was resolved to approve the resignation and elect Yu Huanzheng as the standing director. Yu Huanzheng was elected as the chairman of the board from the standing directors. The reorganization committee members immediately handed over. As of recently, there were a total of 517 members of the association, of which 97 were elected as brokers.

### The Inside Story of the Pseudo Stock Exchange

— Old Man

The Shanghai Stock Exchange officially opened today. We recalled the heavy inside story of the pseudo-stock exchange era, which is chilling. Under the leadership of several standing directors, the upper class followed suit and did their best to blackmail. Before the securities were listed, they had to campaign to the standing directors and pay a considerable price before they could obtain the listing election (only one or two were exceptions). After a heavy blackmail, it was not yet over. They also had to bribe the field affairs section with heavy profits (in addition to cash, there were also ways to give shares and distribute shares). Otherwise, the stock of this manufacturer would be in danger of being shelved (suspended on the upper floor on both sides of the market). Because of that place, it was inconvenient to buy and sell, and after a long time, it might become a cold stock or a moldy stock. At that time, as long as you look at that stock, moving from a remote place to a lively or central position, this stock must have something to do. At the same time, in front of this stock's sign, there must be a large number of surface gangs (small speculators who grab hats), and field affairs section members or other employees in the exchange. Speaking of surface gangs, they are really powerful. The pseudo exchange clearly stipulates that each broker is only allowed to send two agents to enter the market without any flexibility. However, these surface gangs can freely enter and exit the heavily guarded and strictly inspected market gate. Moreover, the legitimate agents are often unreasonably bullied by the field affairs section personnel, but the surface gangs can do whatever they want and take full advantage of it. It is nothing more than that money can make the world go round.

### A Brief History of the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Its Business Evolution

— Chen Xusun

The trading of securities in Shanghai truly began in the late Qing Dynasty. Initially, only a few firms acted as agents for buying and selling in other ports. Later, the number of practitioners gradually increased, but they each acted independently, limited by their narrow views. This led to the rubber stock craze, and the credibility of stocks was almost completely ruined. In the early years of the Republic of China, the industry organized the Stock Business Association, established articles of association, and cooperated with each other. Business developed daily, and the types of securities also gradually increased. Connections with the outside world also became increasingly close. The situation in all aspects could no longer tolerate the long-term closed-door approach. Therefore, in the eighth year of the Republic of China, the organization of Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange Co., Ltd. was initiated, with a capital of three million yuan. In May of the ninth year, the approval from the Ministry was obtained, brokers were set up, and purely securities market transactions began. The existence of a formal market for securities trading in Shanghai is often considered to have started from this point. However, at that time, exchanges sprang up like mushrooms after rain, and the government had not yet issued unified laws and regulations, resulting in daily market prices being inconsistent and varying. The following year, the credit crunch occurred, and many exchanges in various industries went bankrupt. Fortunately, those who supported securities were able to cope in time, and this budding business was spared from external attacks, but still suffered a slight setback, and the share capital was reduced to one million. In the years that followed, due to political instability and frequent internal conflicts, the Qilu War, the Fengzhi War, and the 96 Incident directly and indirectly affected the existence of the securities market. It was not until the completion of the Northern Expedition and the promulgation of the Exchange Law and its implementing rules in the eighteenth year that the exchange had regulations to follow. According to the law, each type of exchange was limited to one per region, and those operating in the same type were required to merge within a specified period. At that time, there was still a securities and commodities exchange operating in the Shanghai securities market, which should have been merged according to the law. Until May of the second year, the securities portion of that exchange was merged into the Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange, and the capital was changed to 1.2 million yuan. The other parts were merged into specialized exchanges according to their types. From then on, the Shanghai securities market was legally unified, and all market prices were no longer inconsistent. The following year, the buildings were rebuilt, and the only complete securities market in the country was established. The company's reputation gradually increased, and the volume of transactions also increased daily. After that, after the September 18th Incident and the January 28th Incident, bond prices plummeted, and the market was temporarily closed for a short period of time, but it was quickly restored. On August 13th of the 26th year, the Japanese invaders attacked Shanghai, and the closure of business was announced on the same day. At the same time, an order was received from the Ministry to prepare for moving to Wuhan. In November, personnel were sent to Wuhan to establish a preparatory office, but a market was never established. Until after the victory in the 34th year, the internal affairs of the exchange were reorganized. At the same time, it was felt that the stock market was closely related to the national financial policy and the Shanghai financial organization. In the spring of the 26th year, it was originally planned to increase capital and have various banks invest in order to seek close cooperation. Unfortunately, the war suddenly broke out and it could not be realized. In order to implement the old plans, in the spring of the 35th year, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs jointly hired nine members to prepare for the organization of the Shanghai Securities Exchange. Stocks and bonds were operated separately, and the exchange was reorganized and named the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The capital was set at one billion yuan. In addition to the 600 million yuan invested by the Chinese Stock Exchange, the remaining 400 million yuan was undertaken by state-owned banks. The original market was expanded and renovated, and business began on September 9th of that year. This is a brief history of the Shanghai securities market. A brief discussion of the changes in its business is as follows:

In the late Qing Dynasty, there were no government bonds issued. In addition to those issued by foreign firms, there were only a few types of Chinese stocks, such as China Merchants Group and Hanyeping. Since there were few types, the turnover was small. After the founding of the Republic of China, industrial and commercial organizations gradually increased. However, those with large capital did not exceed several million yuan. The number of stocks was no more than tens of thousands of shares. After deducting the shares held by directors and supervisors, the number of shares in circulation was extremely small, and the managers were mostly limited by old habits and unwilling to assist the exchange. When asked, they could not get to the point. At the beginning of their investment, investors were introduced by relatives and friends, and they did not ask about the organization's content. Therefore, their personal finances were never used as a tool for financing their investments. On the one hand, they were ashamed to publicly entrust transactions, and on the other hand, there was a lack of publicly determined prices. The scope became narrower and narrower, and the circulation became smaller and smaller. On the contrary, foreign institutions were open about everything, transfers were convenient, and they were protected by extraterritorial rights. They established public associations with only twenty or thirty types, but the daily turnover was in the millions. The outflow of capital was truly regrettable! Since its establishment, the stock exchange has been constantly striving to change the investment concept of the Chinese people, but the result has been suspicion. From the 8th year of the Republic of China to the 26th year of the Republic of China, more than 98% of the securities traded on the stock exchange market were various government bonds. The government's credit gradually strengthened, and bond prices gradually stabilized, so the trading volume also gradually increased. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out, the government moved west, and Shanghai experienced abnormal prosperity. Many new industrial and commercial organizations emerged. In the 32nd year, the puppet organization forced the reopening of the market, specializing in the stocks of domestic companies. The turnover was quite large. As far as the exchange's own business is concerned, it has indeed opened up the old investment habits of our people, and its turning point cannot be ignored. The establishment of the Shanghai Stock Exchange is more closely related to the financial community, and the current industrial and commercial organization procedures are more complete than before. All methods are public, and with the abolition of extraterritorial rights, the public associations have also disintegrated. In the future, it will be easier for investors to choose where to go, and it will be possible to gradually improve the guidance of capital into the right path. Under strict management, the trading market will follow and move forward in order to fulfill its mission, and its work is truly difficult and great.

### Congratulations on the Reopening of the Shanghai Stock Exchange

A stock exchange is a securities market. Securities are commodities, and where there are commodities, there must be buying and selling. Where there is buying and selling, there must be a market. An exchange is simply an organization that a country provides with certain regulations and a name when the market develops to a certain extent.

Before the Shanghai Stock Exchange was legally organized, there was already a securities market. The market came first, and the exchange came later. Therefore, although the form of the exchange only became available after legal organization, the essence of the exchange can be said to be a natural product of the economy, and it is not related to laws and regulations. In other words, when the essential conditions are not yet in place, even if permitted by laws and regulations or promoted by artificial efforts, it may not be possible to run it successfully. Even if it is barely run, it may not be sustainable. The exchange laws and regulations have been promulgated for a long time. How many places in major cities in the country can run successfully? During the credit crunch frenzy in the tenth and eleventh years of the Republic of China, there were more than 140 kinds of exchanges in Shanghai, but how long did it last? It was a flash in the pan, and it never recovered. On the contrary, the public associations that specialized in Chinese and foreign stocks did not obtain the permission of our government, but before the January 28th Incident and the outbreak of the Pacific War, they were always thriving and did not diminish due to the lack of legal conditions. As for the black market for various securities after the stock exchange was closed, it has not been completely eliminated until recently. During the period of occupation, the enemy and puppet institutions used their power to arbitrarily arrest and fine people, and prohibited newspapers from publishing market prices. After the victory, the ban was tightened, and even the telephone lines of the securities companies were cut off, but buying and selling still took place, and the market still existed. It can be seen that when the essential conditions for this market are not in place, there is no point in promoting or encouraging it. When the conditions are already in place and there is a real need, it cannot be strictly prohibited.

We believe that the reorganization of the exchange and its reopening today is a natural measure. Because the establishment of the stock exchange market in this city is a matter of the , and there is indeed a need in the . If we adopt a negative policy and strictly prohibit , it will only turn public into private and prolong the life of this illegal black market trading.

What we should pay attention to is that this market is particularly speculative, and its impact on general finance and commerce is also significant. Therefore, even today, some people still have doubts about this natural product of the economy. It was only after a long delay that a decision was made, and it was necessary to be cautious beforehand because of the excessive abuses.

The situation after the reorganization is obviously different from before in several aspects. (1) The amount of capital has been increased and it has been changed to a joint venture between the government and business. (2) The review of the brokerage association is very strict. (3) The margin is particularly high. (4) In addition to government bonds, stocks are given great importance. (5) Foreign firms are allowed to join as brokers. (4) and (5) can be said to be measures to adapt to the times, while (1), (2) and (3) are particularly important reforms this time.

However, according to past experience, every stock exchange frenzy is mostly due to human problems, and less due to legal problems. Speculation and manipulation of the market, driven by "bear syndicates", "bull syndicates", "large-scale pulling" and certain forces, has always been driven by such people. According to the results of the past regulatory system, it is obviously not enough to deal with these man-made disturbances. It seems that it is still worth considering how to learn from the past, strengthen supervision, and put the market on track and stabilize it.

Some people believe that speculative frenzies are mostly caused by futures trading. Therefore, they advocate prohibiting futures and limiting them to spot transactions. This is naturally a method of prevention and an effective means of preventing short selling. However, the duty of the exchange is to level market prices and regulate finance. The opening of futures trading has such a function. Although its trading object is securities, not goods, it seems that there is no relationship between production and sales, and there is no need to purchase raw materials on the one hand and sell products on the other to seek business stability. However, the most active way for the financial community to adjust its surplus and deficiency is to trade in valuable securities. Therefore, we also believe that there is room for further research on the point of only doing spot transactions and prohibiting term transactions. However, forward transactions are prone to abuse and should be restricted.

The advancement from a market to an exchange is originally the meaning of strengthening management and tightening the organization. The most ideal organization, of course, is to include all circulating securities and commercial firms operating securities within this institution in order to achieve the expected purpose, but this is not permitted in reality. Therefore, to eliminate speculation and stabilize the market, we must actually look beyond the exchange. Because the power of these external factors cannot be ignored, and sometimes it may affect the exchange and even affect the exchange. Therefore, the importance of this issue is not less than that of internal rectification. The measures that have been implemented, such as notifying stock companies to close down, prohibiting brokers from opening black markets, and prohibiting the use or installation of intercom telephones, are all appropriate measures to "resist foreign aggression and pacify the home". However, in order to thoroughly prevent abuses, we must always be vigilant and seek further progress. Where there is profit, people often disregard strict laws. Therefore, in addition to passive prevention, we must also pay attention to active guidance in order to reduce the power of the reaction.

After eight years of the War of Resistance, we finally achieved the final victory, and even more easily, we achieved the reopening of the stock exchange. Looking back and forth, I am willing to offer my humble opinions.

### A General Overview of Securities Market Prices Over the Past Ten Years

— Jiayou

The exchange business is most developed in Shanghai. However, when examining the earliest exchange in China, it should be the Beijing Stock Exchange in the seventh year of the Republic of China, followed by the Shanghai Securities and Commodities Exchange in the eighth year of the Republic of China. At that time, Shanghai already had organizations such as the Stock Brokers Association and the Shanghai Public Association. Although their scope was smaller, their organization and methods already had the prototype of an exchange. However, at the beginning of the establishment of the Shanghai Securities and Commodities Exchange, Chinese joint-stock companies were not yet developed, and there were few trading chips. Therefore, it only focused on the exchange's own stocks, and it was unable to universally develop in promoting enterprises. Moreover, at that time, speculators in general had a craze for exchanges. Those that arose one after another were like bamboo shoots after a rain. According to statistics, there were more than 140 kinds of exchanges at that time, which was truly the heyday of exchanges. However, most of the operators at that time did not follow the right track, which led to serious abuses. They lost all aspects of facilitating buying and selling, supporting business, and circulating finance. On the contrary, they fostered gambling habits, short selling, disrupted real market prices, and shook the safety of the market, which was contrary to the true purpose of establishing an exchange. In the end, they suffered the disastrous consequences of the "credit crunch". This is indeed an interesting anecdote in the history of China's exchanges and a common lesson for operators today.

After the government promulgated the Exchange Law, stipulating that only one exchange could be established in a region for each category, the Securities and Commodities Exchange was also merged into the Chinese Securities Exchange in the 22nd year of the Republic of China. At the right time, the government issued government bonds, and the exchange limited its business to buying and selling government bonds to support its operations. It also restricted trading in its own shares to curb speculation. Targeting the previous shortcomings, the operation of the exchange gradually became regular under the supervision of the government. However, company stocks that helped corporate funding were not formally auctioned, which was not flexible enough for the financial market. Moreover, when the War of Resistance broke out, the exchange was again closed, which was a major blow to its development.

After the enemy and puppets controlled Shanghai, they flooded the market with counterfeit currency. The general public believed that counterfeit currency had no monetary value, and those who had capital were quite wary. In addition to trying every means to hoard materials, they also set up companies, factories, and other various businesses. Joint-stock companies gradually increased, and stock trading suddenly became a market. Therefore, the puppet government ordered the Chinese Stock Exchange to resume operations, creating an informal market for Chinese stocks. Some speculators, seeing the strict control of materials by the enemy and puppets, shifted their speculative targets to stocks. Moreover, at that time, the market prohibited government bonds and foreign stocks were also prohibited from public trading due to their hostile relationship. Therefore, the exchanges under the enemy and puppet organizations only traded in Chinese stocks. However, at that time, the operation of stocks was purely for speculative purposes, and it did not help the development and prosperity of industry and commerce, but disrupted financial changes.

In the year since the victory, the puppet exchanges have long been closed. Although there is no formal market for Chinese stock trading, it has become the target of speculators. Therefore, under the leadership of social leaders, economic authorities, and industrial and commercial leaders, in order to channel floating capital into the right track, encourage production, prosper the market, promote business, investment, promote economic recovery, establish a sound securities market, and support industrial and commercial enterprises, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs approved the restoration of the Chinese Stock Exchange, which is scheduled to officially open on the 9th of this month. Its business types are stipulated to include (1) government bonds, (2) corporate bonds, and (3) stocks. It is also reported that stocks include both Chinese and foreign stocks, which must be strictly reviewed before they can be listed. Then, the securities market can be expected to move towards the right track. It is the most important meaning in economic recovery.

Now, the changes in the black market prices of securities over the past ten years are listed separately below for reference.
