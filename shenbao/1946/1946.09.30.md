### Chairman and Wife Visited Linggu Temple Yesterday, Government to Issue Statement on the Current Situation, Dong Biwu Visits U.S. Envoy to Discuss Ceasefire

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 29th] It is reported that the government will issue a document regarding the current situation. The document has been finalized and is expected to be released on the 30th. Furthermore, the Chairman, accompanied by his wife, visited Linggu Temple in the morning of the 29th, leisurely strolling along the mountain paths, unburdening their minds in the autumn sun. In the afternoon, they also visited Xuanwu Lake. At 7:30 PM, they hosted a dinner for Mrs. Marshall and Mrs. Stuart. Ambassador Stuart and his advisor, Fu Jingbo, were also invited to attend. After the meal, they watched a movie together. In addition, Ambassador Stuart had no other activities on the 29th besides attending church in the afternoon, only attending the dinner at the Marshall's residence in the evening. It is also heard that the Ambassador will visit the Chairman on the 30th.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 29th] The situation for peace negotiations is gradually brightening. To achieve peace as soon as possible, the government has accepted the suggestion of Envoy Marshall to advance military and political negotiations simultaneously. The conference procedures are still under discussion and were not finalized on the 29th. However, it is said that the government's attitude remains in favor of simultaneous progress, with politics taking precedence over military matters. Since learning that the Chairman had once again accepted this suggestion, all parties in the capital have admired the Chairman's eagerness for peace and have been in more frequent contact. At 10:00 AM on the 29th, Dong Biwu and Wang Bingnan visited Envoy Marshall's residence and did not leave until 1:30 PM, still discussing negotiation methods and ceasefire issues. The government's acceptance of Envoy Marshall's new negotiation proposal has also been conveyed to Dong Biwu and Wang Bingnan, with the hope that Zhou Enlai can return to Nanjing immediately. Dong Biwu will convey this intention to Zhou Enlai in Shanghai on the evening of the 29th. If Zhou has no other opinions, it is expected that he will return to Nanjing soon. Furthermore, reliable sources state that reports in various newspapers about Stuart and Marshall having a new plan and organizing a comprehensive conference to discuss military matters first and then political matters are all speculative due to nervousness.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] Since Chairman Chiang's return to Nanjing, peace negotiations have been progressing daily. Communist representatives Dong Biwu and Wang Bingnan visited Envoy Marshall at 10:00 AM on the 29th to exchange opinions on the ceasefire issue, departing after two and a half hours. It is heard that Marshall informed Dong that the government would accept his and Ambassador Stuart's new proposal to simultaneously negotiate political and military issues. General observation suggests that the government's negotiations with the Communists will be based on political issues. General Marshall hosted a dinner at his residence in the evening for Madam Chiang, who recently returned to Nanjing, and invited Ambassador Stuart and Fu Jingbo to accompany them. Marshall and Stuart further discussed the current developments regarding peace negotiations.

[United Press, Nanjing, 29th] The government personnel of the Three-Man Military Group are currently preparing documents with relevant negotiation materials. The date of Zhou Enlai's arrival in Nanjing has not yet been determined. Dong Biwu will represent the Communists and Zhou in the meetings, but Zhou has not completely withdrawn from the negotiations.

The publicly declared policy of the United States government is to promote peace and reconciliation in China. General Marshall and the Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation are working towards this goal. The U.S. Marine Corps is not involved. Our traditional responsibility in establishing American policy is to assist and support this policy and to protect the lives and property of Americans in any part of the world.

### Communist Party's Extraordinary Committee Opposes Mao Zedong's Line, Advocates a Shift from Armed Struggle to Peaceful Development

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 29th] The military announced on the 29th a document obtained from the Communist Party's Extraordinary Committee in the Communist area opposing Mao Zedong's line. The document shows that there are differences of opinion within the Communist Party and that rifts have occurred. The Extraordinary Committee criticized the failure of the military adventures in northern Jiangsu as an error of Mao Zedong's line, and proposed opposing Mao Zedong's line and overthrowing "fascism." The document stated that the Communist Party has relaxed all efforts to strive for peace, underestimated the strength of the government, miscalculated the domestic and international situation, and embarked on military adventures, leading to the current difficult situation. The Extraordinary Committee advocated a shift to the road of peaceful democracy, from armed struggle to peaceful development, striving for national democracy from local democracy, and joining hands with all parties in accordance with the opinions of the entire people. It also pointed out that Mao Zedong was afraid of unity and trembled at the mention of orthodoxy, which was cowardly and shameless.

### Communist Troops Launch Another Destructive Offensive Against the Longhai and Jinpu Railways, Communist Troops in Southern Shandong Conscripting Large Numbers of Soldiers to Send to Northern Jiangsu

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch on the 28th] At 9:00 PM on the 26th, Communist troops launched another destructive offensive against the Longhai Line. Communist troops planted landmines three kilometers east of Luowang Station, bombing a mixed train departing from Xuzhou. The train had over a thousand passengers, with many deaths and injuries. An unknown number of Communist troops fought fiercely with the railway protection troops while destroying two kilometers of track. The Communist troops retreated at 1:00 AM this morning. The Longhai Line has been cut off again and may be repaired on the 28th. Passengers have been concentrated at Luowang Station.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch on the 28th] The 71st mixed train on the Longhai Railway, Xuzhou-Bian section, heading east, detonated a Communist landmine three kilometers east of Luowang on the night of the 26th. Over 300 Communist troops took the opportunity to destroy one kilometer of track. If repairs go smoothly, traffic may resume on the 30th.

[Our Jinan Dispatch on the 28th] According to government reports, Communist troops in southern Shandong are conscripting large numbers of soldiers and sending them to northern Jiangsu to replenish their forces. 2,000 new militiamen were conscripted in Linyi and sent to the Taierzhuang front line. The Jinpu Railway continues to be damaged by Communist troops. The railway between Tai'an and Yanzhou has been completely destroyed by Communist troops who conscripted civilians, and the Panghe Bridge south of Tai'an has been completely demolished. A large number of new weapons continue to arrive in Yantai, all transported by the Communist troops from Dalian.

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 29th] Since the National Army recovered Heze (Caozhou) in western Shandong, the surrounding villages have also been peaceful. The Lanhe Highway from Lanfeng to Caozhou has also been cleared. When the National Army first moved in, the Communist troops implemented a scorched-earth policy, removing all food from the people. Now, after pacification, many of the people who were coerced and held hostage have returned to their homes. The number of Communist troops surrendering rises every day. Currently, our military and government are working together to settle the area and organize Baojia. Furthermore, Commander Liu Ruming of the Fourth Pacification District arrived in the county seat on the morning of the 28th, conveying the central government's intentions.

### Zhu De Arrives in Zhangjiakou to Plan Defense, Chahar Province Becomes Military Focus, National Army Advancing from Northern Henan Recovers Cixian

[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 29th] The military situation in North China is focused on Chahar, presenting a sense of impending storm. Director of the Beiping Provisional Headquarters Li Zongren also does not speak clearly. The situation in Chahar Province may become clear soon. However, overall, the provinces of Hebei, Rehe, Suiyuan, Shanxi, and Henan have not yet moved beyond the stage of active preparation and containment. Sun Lianzhong told reporters yesterday that the National Army will clear the Pinghan and Jinpu lines, but did not mention the Pingsui line. Wang Hongshao, a staff officer at the Beiping Provisional Headquarters, also denied that the Hebei-Rehe National Army has begun operations against Chahar. He seemed quite confused by the recent conflicting news reports. The "Observer" has also issued inconsistent statements. The focus of the future battle, whether in eastern Chahar, western Chahar, or northern Chahar, is debated. Besides the Communist troops voluntarily abandoning 32 locations in eastern and western Chahar that were indefensible, there is no evidence that the National Army has formally launched an attack. The strength of the National Army in Rehe is quite strong, which seems close to the truth. Reports of encircling Chang and forcing Dolun are definitely not accurate, but Dolun will eventually be a contested place, because gaining that location can control northern Rehe and cut off the main communication line of the Communist troops in the Northeast. Currently, the military affairs of the southwestern half of Rehe Province from Chifeng in a straight line to the south have been assigned to the Eleventh War Zone, while the other half remains under the Northeast Headquarters. After the military affairs in eastern Suiyuan come to an end, the so-called Fu Zuoyi troops have advanced into Chahar, which cannot be confirmed. Insiders say that a short period of reorganization is needed after the Jining battle. In Hebei Province, in addition to the tense deployment on the Hebei-Chahar border, the actions of the two armies in central and southern Hebei in recent days seem to be containing Chahar Province. The National Army around Baoding is gradually developing outwards, while the Communist troops are actively threatening the northern section of the Pinghan Line. Bombing incidents, which have not been heard of for months, occurred again yesterday near Dongchangshou. After the Communist troops in eastern Hebei suffered losses, the main force in central Hebei is on the Pinggu Line, containing actions on the Hebei-Chahar border. The National Army advancing north from Anyang in northern Henan has recovered Cixian, threatening Liu Bocheng's base in Handan and Shun, De, and containing Liu's troops in southern Hebei from being transferred north. Communist troops in Shanxi Province have launched a full-scale counterattack to cover the emptiness of northern Shanxi. Governor Yan said at the memorial week a few days ago that the military victory in eastern Suiyuan has not yet alleviated the crisis in Shanxi.

[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 29th] Why the National Army has been slow to advance on Zhangjiakou has become a mystery that the press here wants to uncover. Some sensitive observers believe that after Stalin's speech, the international situation has become more moderate, so Chairman Chiang returned to Nanjing early to re-discuss the possibility of a peaceful solution, which is why the advance on Zhangjiakou has been delayed. Wang Hongshao, Chief of Staff of the Beiping Provisional Headquarters, also told reporters at a cocktail party for U.S. military dependents last night that the military plans and actions in North China can be changed by Nanjing at any time according to the political situation, and clearly stated that peace negotiations can affect military actions at any time.

[Our Tianjin Dispatch on the 29th] Amidst the rumors of a major battle brewing in southern Hebei, the National Army has approached Handan. The Communist troops have deployed strong forces in the counties around Handan, including Yongnian, Cheng'an, Shahe, Nanhe, Pingxiang, and Jize. Fierce battles are imminent.

[Our Tianjin Dispatch on the 29th] Bridge No. 80, 64 kilometers between Jingxing and Nanyu on the Zhengtai Railway, was destroyed by Communist troops planting landmines on the 28th. One span of the bridge was destroyed and will take approximately three days to repair.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 29th] The Communist troops near Datong are fleeing in different directions towards Guancunpu and Julepu east of the railway, trying to control the Tongyang-Gaotai highway. Chen Zhengxiang, the leader of the Communist troops, recently convened a meeting of cadres from the Jin-Ji Military Region and reportedly decided to abandon the railway line and launch attacks on the National Army on the spot. In other news, due to the repeated military setbacks of the Communist Party, Zhu De was specially dispatched from Yan'an to Zhangjiakou to plan the defense.

[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 29th] Amidst the sound of war drums, the weekend was spent leisurely. Last night, senior military leaders such as Li Zongren and Sun Lianzhong attended the cocktail party at Huai Ren Hall and watched Xiao Cuihua's "Picking Up the Jade Bracelet" and Zhang Junqiu's "Fenhe Bay." The headquarters also had a concert, resembling a peaceful scene. Although the sky in Beiping today is clear and vast, there are few military planes, and the headquarters is in a semi-holiday state. Officials have not confirmed the report of entering Kangzhuang. In eastern Hebei, Jianchangying is still occupied by Communist troops, with no new developments. In eastern Suiyuan and northern Shanxi, the major battles have just ended, and urgent rest and reorganization are needed, with no immediate signs of advancing. The report here that troops have entered Shangdu and Shangyi is likely to be local guerrillas. Some sources say that the 16th Army will be airlifted to eastern Suiyuan to participate in the operations of the 12th War Zone, but this has not been confirmed. Whether the current peace in North China is the beginning of peace or the calm before the storm remains to be proven by facts.

[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 29th] A military official defending Datong flew to Beiping last night, claiming that after Fu Zuoyi's troops lifted the siege of Datong, they continued to advance east in coordination with some of the Datong garrison, approaching Yanggao, an important town in western Chahar.

[Our GuiSui Dispatch on the 28th] The military here confirmed on the 28th that eastern Suiyuan and Horinger County have been recovered. With this, the territory of Suiyuan Province has been restored, and the four counties in eastern Suiyuan occupied by the Communist troops have been recovered by the National Army one after another. The city of Suiyuan is exceptionally joyous today.

[Our GuiSui Dispatch on the 28th] After the National Army recovered Jining, they have successively recovered Longshengzhuang and Xinghe County, and order and morale have been stabilized. The entire eastern Suiyuan has taken on a new atmosphere (Note: Suiyuan is now a complete province in North China).

[Our GuiSui Dispatch on the 26th] According to Shi Zhiren, who arrived in Suiyuan today, the National Army on the eastern section of the Pingsui Railway has approached Huailai. There is also a widespread rumor here that Yanggao has been recovered. The Jining Peace Briefing issued a special edition.

### Mongolian Banner Restoration Work is Gradually Underway

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 29th] Mongolian Banner restoration work is gradually underway. In Suiyuan Province, the restorer includes seven banners of the Ulanqab League.

In areas where the government's strength extends, work has been carried out to settle refugees and restore order.

### Air Defense Facilities in Suburban Beijing to be Surveyed Soon

Regarding air defense equipment, in addition to some of the original equipment at the rear having arrived, some of the equipment received from the enemy and puppets can also be applied. Recently, a batch of the latest equipment has also arrived.

### New Military Training Plan to be Implemented Starting in November

According to Zhang's friends, he will be discharged from the hospital soon.

### Ministry of Communications Plans to Adjust Highway Passenger Transport Fees

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 29th] Due to the severe losses in highway transportation in recent months, the communications authorities, although the government has allocated subsidies, which are only enough to make up for some of the losses, plan to adjust passenger transport fees on all routes starting from October 1st. It is heard that the proposal has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for review, but it is generally believed that there may not be an increase in the short term. Currently, highway passenger transport fees are those set in January of this year, nearly nine months ago.

### Japanese War Criminals Tojo and Others

We May Request Extradition for Trial

[United Press, Nanjing, 29th] According to an official involved in the trial of war criminals, if the results of the trials by the Far East Military Tribunal of important Japanese war criminals such as Hideki Tojo are not satisfactory to China, the government may request extradition for trial by Chinese military tribunals, but preparations have not yet been made to do so. China currently has eleven military tribunals trying war criminals, two of which are in the three northeastern provinces, one under the Northeast Headquarters and one organized by the Changchun Northeast Security Command.

### Forty-One Taiwanese to be Tried in Japan

### At a Welcoming Banquet for Wei Daoming in Shenyang, Xiong and Du Discuss Recent Northeast Affairs, Xiong Shihui Says the Government Will Continue Receiving, Du Yuming Says People in Communist Areas Form Underground Armies

[Our Shenyang Dispatch on the 28th] At a joint cocktail party hosted by Shenyang authorities on the afternoon of the 27th to welcome Wei Daoming, Xiong Shihui told reporters that people in the Northeast's unrecovered areas eagerly await the government's reception. If there are no obstacles or difficulties, the reception will continue to fulfill the people's expectations. Dalian, Harbin, and Andong all have similar situations. When asked about the rumor that the Soviet Union will send troops to strengthen the defense of the China Chang Railway, Xiong said he had not heard of it. Du Yuming was then asked to comment on the current situation in the Northeast. He said that besides a small number of Communist troops causing trouble, the Northeast is generally calm. However, in various Communist areas, people who oppose the Communist troops' policies and destructive actions have formed underground armies, using weapons scattered by the former enemy and puppet forces to engage in resistance. It is heard that this spontaneous organization of the people numbers no less than 200,000. This spontaneous organization of people who love the government and are concerned with their own interests, and the people who express their views on right and wrong, will have a definite evaluation, no matter how the Communist Party fabricates things, it is difficult to cover everyone's eyes and ears. In other news, Mayor Dong Wenqi of Xiaoxiao said that the Shenyang power line has been cut off for three days. The investigation revealed that the disruption was caused by an obstacle in the project near Qingyuan in the Communist area. People have been sent to Qingyuan to negotiate with the Communist troops to facilitate repairs, which are expected to be completed in three or four days.

### Sino-American Commercial Treaty Finalized; Currently Under Review, Signing Expected Soon; British Trade Mission Departs London for China Today

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] The Sino-American commercial treaty, under negotiation since April of this year, has reached a mature stage. During the negotiations, the Chinese side was represented by Li Gan, Deputy Secretary-General of the Supreme Economic Council, and Wang Cheng, Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The newly appointed Papal Nuncio to China and the Legislative Yuanâs economic representatives also provided input on important matters. The initial draft of the commercial treaty has been thoroughly studied and finalized in recent days. It is currently being reviewed by Minister Wang Shijie and is expected to be approved within the week. The signing date is also expected to be set soon, and a signing ceremony and reception will be held. It is understood that the Sino-American negotiations began earliest and will result in the first formal commercial treaty China signs with a foreign country. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is taking this very seriously. It is reported that the Sino-British and Sino-French commercial treaties will use the Sino-American treaty as a blueprint for future negotiations.

[Central News Agency, London, 29th] The British Board of Trade officially announced that the British Trade Mission to China, consisting of nine members and three secretaries, will depart England for China on the morning of the 30th.

### Northeast China's Treasure Trove Surpasses East Asia; Intensive Development Cannot Be Delayed; Interview with Wang Wenwei, Special Commissioner of the Central Bank in the Northeast

[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] "The Northeast is a treasure trove of East Asia, with unlimited resources. The region's factories account for nearly 80% of the national total. Although they have been looted and damaged, many of the original facilities are still substantial. There is the Xiaofengman Hydroelectric Plant in Yongji and the Yalu River Hydroelectric Plant, whose power can be used for the development of agriculture and industry. In addition, low wages and few labor disputes make it a breeding ground for entrepreneurs across the country. If we devote the nation's manpower and resources, eliminate local past concepts, and accelerate development and the recovery of factories, the future of production and the prospects for international trade will be immeasurable. In this way, goods will flow smoothly, and legal tender will return to circulation, which can curb inflation." These were the opening remarks of Wang Wenwei, the newly arrived Special Commissioner of the Central Bank in the Northeast, when asked by a Central News Agency reporter about the current economic situation in the Northeast.

Finance

Regarding the Central Bank's establishment of a financial network, Wang stated that the Central Bank has already established branches in Shenyang, Changchun, Siping, Jinzhou, Shanhaiguan, and Jilin. Branches in Yingkou and Chengde are also in preparation. Now that trade between inside and outside the customs has opened, commercial and industrial remittances should be opened immediately. As for the exchange rate, according to the Central Bank's announcement, the exchange rate for remittances to Tianjin is 11.5 yuan per unit, and the exchange rate for remittances from Tianjin is 12.5 yuan per unit. The rate will be adjusted at any time according to the Central Bank's posted rate. Regarding Red Army currency, within the recovered areas, 2 billion yuan of 100-yuan notes have been redeemed. Small notes are only being collected and not released. The issuance of circulating currency is intended to prevent the devaluation of the people's funds (referring to Manchukuo currency). It is stipulated to be calculated at a 1:1 ratio. After the recovery of various regions, another price will be sought based on the prices of various goods within the customs, according to the value of legal tender, and then it will be recovered. The difficulties are numerous. For the time being, it will be based on the price index within the customs at that time, at a ratio of 1:13. It was originally intended to be adjusted according to the rise and fall of the index, but the authorities retained it out of consideration for the salaries of military police and civil servants.

Gold Price

When the reporter inquired about the price of gold in the Northeast, Wang stated that the price fluctuations there are based on Tianjin and Beijing as the standard. When he left Shenyang, the price of gold was around 300,000 yuan per tael. At first glance, the price difference from within the customs is very large. In fact, the local measurement system has not yet been unified, and the old system of 8 mace and 6 fen per 10,000 units is still used. In various parts of the Northeast, gold shops are an emerging industry, but they must first be approved by the committee before they can operate. During the Manchukuo era, gold was state-owned, and women's ornaments were also prohibited. Now, gold shops operate with decorative items as their target. The gold content is not based on the 99% or 98% deduction system but is based on the quality of the brand-name silver shop's stamp.

[Central News Agency, Chengde, 28th] The Rehe Bank has received 50 million yuan (circulating currency) from the Central Government and will open soon. It will focus on regulating finance and promoting local commercial recovery. It is also reported that the Agricultural Bank of China and the Farmers Bank of China will also open here soon.

On the way back, we also inspected Jinzhou. We received more than 250 letters of denunciation. The takeover situation in the Northeast is simpler than in the interior. Although many cases of corruption have been found, there are also some that are in relatively good condition. All units in the interior have original takeover inventories, but the Northeast has many takings based on existing resources because of the special circumstances."

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] Jing Qingcha, Wei Fuyu, Zhu Cangzhou, and others went to Zhenjiang and Wuxi on the 29th to investigate. The results of the investigation in Nanjing have not yet been announced.

### Cargo Transport Between Inside and Outside the Customs to Simplify Procedures

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 28th] The establishment of a cargo transport office between inside and outside the customs is very important for the exchange of goods and the restoration of the economy. However, because all goods must be transferred at Shanhaiguan, the procedures are cumbersome, and the costs are high. At the same time, it is also prone to corruption. It is reported that the relevant authorities have decided that cargo transport will be changed to direct transport from October 1st.

### Enemy and Puppet Daily Necessities in Beiping and Tianjin Sold for 24 Billion

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 29th] The Hebei-Beiping-Tianjin Area Daily Necessities Disposal Committee sold confiscated daily necessities from enemy and puppet property, generating a total revenue of over 24,097,900,000 yuan from March to the end of August this year.

### The Work of Repatriating Captives in the Northeast is Coming to an End; The Performing Arts Troupe's Final Departure from Shenyang Expresses Reluctance

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 28th] The work of repatriating enemy nationals and captives in the Northeast has reached its final stage. The American transport ships were originally scheduled to stop transporting at the end of September, but because the enemy nationals and captives in the Communist-controlled areas arrived at the port later, it is feared that it will have to be extended to mid-to-late October. Currently, there are approximately 280,000 to 290,000 Japanese nationals and captives concentrated and awaiting transport in Jinzhou, Huludao, and other places. Shenyang will make the final batch of shipments. Among them is an art troupe organized by a certain military agency. The troupe has more than 30 Japanese male and female music and dance stars, originally prepared to perform and dance at various celebrations as entertainment. In addition to showing their skills at gatherings, they mostly sold tickets at the Jianguo Hall to make a living. Their sweet singing and flying legs have captivated countless people over the past two months. However, the good times will not last long, and the troupe must leave Shenyang soon. Therefore, they are giving a farewell commemorative performance. The 29th is the last day. The Japanese women wear fashionable Chinese costumes, singing "Roses Everywhere" and "When Will You Return," while also posting slogans such as "Goodbye, Shenyang." This kind of performing arts group with a thousand emotions is now the rearguard of the final stage of the Japanese invasion of the Northeast. The enemy opened the stage with iron hooves and closed the curtain with beauty, song, and dance. It can be said to be a commemorative story worth writing about, and it is also full of profound meaning.

### Aluminum Ore Exploration in the Fujian-Taiwan Area; Hu Wenhu Plans to Establish a Fujian Construction Company

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] Mineral exploration is being actively carried out in various regions of South China, with aluminum ore as one of the main focuses. Fujian and Taiwan are the central areas for exploration and development, which is closely related to the establishment of our aviation industry. It is also reported that once transportation and order in the Northeast are relatively stable, the authorities will organize a large-scale exploration team to develop the Northeast's rich resources.

[United Press, Singapore, 28th] Hu Wenhu recently returned here from China and is now planning to establish a Fujian Construction Company with a capital of Â£300,000 to develop Fujian Province's railways, highways, coal mines, steel mills, iron ore mines, and power plants. Hu himself is prepared to invest approximately Â£50,000, with the remaining capital to be invested half by Fujianese overseas Chinese in the Malay Peninsula and the other half by Fujianese overseas Chinese in Burma, Siam, and the Dutch East Indies.

### Shandong Provincial Senator Li Runshen Found Guilty of Corruption During the Takeover

The Provincial Senate Guarantees the Surrender of the Perpetrator

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 29th] The last person found guilty by the Shandong-Henan Investigation Team before its conclusion was Li Runshen, the former manager of the Jinan Electric Power Company, for corruption during the takeover. Li Dingshuchen is currently the chairman of the Jinan Chamber of Commerce, a Shandong Provincial Senator, and a representative to the National Assembly. During the takeover, he used his position to collude with the Japanese to steal and sell 600 tons of coal and over 600 rolls of military-use iron wire, 3 tons of steel rails, 12 wheels, 300 cotton quilts, over 20 boxes of porcelain teapots, and 54 barrels of grease, and concealed 600 bags of flour. After the team investigated and confirmed the evidence, it intended to transfer the suspect to the court. However, it was during the session of the Provincial Senate, and it was inconvenient to arrest him. Unexpectedly, the suspect took the opportunity to escape. Later, the Senate issued a guarantee to ensure that he would be brought to justice within 24 hours of the end of the session. The team then transferred the relevant documents to the District Prosecutor's Office on the afternoon of the 28th.

### Former Prime Minister of Siam to Visit China

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 28th] According to local newspapers, former Prime Minister of Siam, Phraya Phahon Phonphayuhasena, may travel abroad next month, first to China and then to Europe and the United States.

### Demarcation of the Jiangyin Fortress Area; The Scope is Larger than Before the War

[Our Jiangyin Communication] The Ministry of National Defense is actively rebuilding the Jiangyin Fortress, and the area is larger than before the war. It has now been demarcated, including Goose Mountain, East Mountain, Huangshan Mountain, Xiaoshan Mountain, Changshan Mountain, Wushan Mountain, etc. The outer periphery extends from Wujin East Township in the west to Changshu Fushan in the east, from Jingjiang Liuyi Port to Tianshen in Jiangbei, and from Langshan along the river in the south. All of these are included in the fortress area. Commander Kong has sent personnel to survey the entire fortress terrain separately for planning and construction. Also, because the Yangtze River is also within the fortress area, the current state of river defense is important, so ship registration is being carried out. Riverbank fishing households must also be investigated. When necessary, fishing boats will be prohibited from fishing in the fortress area. Residents living on land in the fortress area will undergo household registration and be issued resident certificates for identification.

### Landlord Beats Tenant Farmer to Death in Longdengchang, Hanyang

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 29th] A case occurred in Longdengchang, Hanyang, the day before yesterday in which a landlord used his power to beat a tenant farmer to death. Tenants of the Sichuan Guild Hall in Hankou requested a reduction in last year's rent and requested that this year's rent be paid at market price. The guild rejected the demand, causing a dispute. Yin Fu, the director of the guild (currently the Director of the Hubei Provincial Food and Grain Department), then instigated Director Tang Xiaoyi to personally lead eight armed soldiers to search the tenant's home. The tenant protested, and a soldier kicked Yang Kaiwen's abdomen, severely injuring his scrotum, causing his immediate death. In addition to reporting the death to the court for an autopsy, the tenant farmer's family also appealed to all quarters for assistance.

### More Than 400 American Missionaries Departed from the United States Yesterday by Ship for China

### Silk Mill Strike in Wuxi Escalates; Rongshen Mill Destroyed by Female Workers; County Magistrate Xu Orders All Workers to Return to Work Today

[Our Wuxi Dispatch, 29th] The second wave of strikes in silk mills throughout the county has escalated. No work has resumed today. The Rongshen Silk Mill in the south gate was destroyed by female workers, who cut the silk and damaged the staff. According to reports, County Magistrate Xu stated that some workers in silk mills such as the Jiatei Silk Mill in the east gate were incited by malicious elements and engaged in disruptive behavior. He specifically issued a handwritten order to the silk reeling industry union to inform all factory workers that they must all return to work starting on the 30th. At 2:00 PM, representatives from each factory were sent to the silk mill union for instruction. It was stated that any further illegal actions would be investigated and punished without leniency. At the same time, the capitalists also convened an extraordinary general meeting of all members. After discussion, it was resolved that due to the workers' repeated strikes, work would not resume until a guarantee method was obtained from the authorities.

### Fu Sinian Arrives in Nanjing from Beiping; Discusses this Year's Joint Entrance Examination; Southern Candidates' Results to be Announced in this Newspaper

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] Fu Sinian arrived in Nanjing by plane from Beiping at 3:30 PM on the 29th. After arriving in Nanjing, Fu Sinian met with Central News Agency reporters at the Academia Sinica and said that the situation at Peking University was very good. The return of the professors from Kunming was particularly admirable. Under the leadership of President Hu Shi in the future, Peking University will definitely become a true academic institution. The school can accommodate 5,000 students in the second half of the year because too many young people have lost their education and must find ways to accommodate them in large numbers. This year's joint entrance examination for Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Nankai University showed that more candidates applied for engineering subjects, and the number of candidates applying for Peking University was limited. The admission standard this time was based on the sum of the scores in Chinese, English, and mathematics, with a total score of 80 or more being admitted. However, very few were admitted to Peking University. Later, Peking University and Tsinghua University stipulated that those with a total score of 70 in the three subjects could be admitted first. The second announcement was made in Beiping on the 28th. Those taking the examination in the south will have their results published in the Shanghai Shen Bao. All those who originally applied to Peking University will enter Peking University, and those who applied to Nankai University will enter Nankai University. Those who applied to Tsinghua will change to Peking University or Nankai University at their discretion because Tsinghua's quota is full. In terms of the level of the examination, Shanghai was the best, Chongqing was second, and Beiping and Guangzhou were the worst. The standard of students in Beiping used to be the highest in the country, but now it has plummeted, which is very painful.

Editorial

### The Illusion of Fairbank's Thesis

Mr. Fairbank, the former director of the Press Department of the U.S. Embassy in China, recently published an article in The Atlantic Monthly entitled "America's Opportunity in China," which reviews American policy toward China. It contains many irrelevant and superficial remarks that cannot be left uncorrected. During Fairbank's time in China, he recruited many communists and left-leaning people into the organization he headed. His views may therefore be biased, which is regrettable.

As far as Sino-American relations are concerned, our two peoples have always maintained friendly relations. The United States has spent a lot of money promoting religion, medicine, health, and education in China. China has also spent a lot of money sending many students across the ocean to study in the United States. In every level of society today, there are people who have received American education and occupy very important positions. As Mr. Fairbank said, "The China we know today is built by a large group of people who have used our (meaning American) experience." Especially during the War of Resistance, Sino-American relations became even closer, and cultural exchanges became even smoother. Logically, there should no longer be any barriers or misunderstandings between China and the United States. But unfortunately, Fairbank's thesis contains many misinterpretations of China. We are not so stubborn as to refuse to listen to a pertinent comment, but if foreigners comment on China's internal affairs with preconceived notions and force us to agree, they will inevitably have a superficial feeling. On the one hand, we should welcome Fairbank's sincere advice, but on the other hand, we do not want some self-proclaimed "China experts" who are actually "ignorant" to cause deeper estrangement between China and the United States. Therefore, we must express our views to correct the views of the Chinese and American people.

First, Mr. Fairbank places the responsibility for the failure to implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference entirely on the right-wing of the Kuomintang. This view is obviously unfair. We do not need to completely deny that within the Kuomintang, such a large party, there may be differences of opinion, just as the Democratic Party in the United States also debates the government's foreign policy. This is not surprising. However, the policy of the Kuomintang is decided by the representative congress or the central plenary session. Once a decision is made, whether it is left or right, everyone obeys and cannot be blamed on the so-called right-wing. Moreover, these divisions of left and right are the Communist Party's attempts to divide the Kuomintang, and Fairbank has unintentionally been deceived and anesthetized. In fact, the most important key to the failure to fully implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference is that the Communist Party believes in the omnipotence of force and first destroyed the reorganization plan, established its so-called "Democratic Allied Army" in the Northeast, and prevented the National Army from entering the Northeast to restore sovereignty. At the same time, the Soviet Union moved out all of the Northeast's industrial equipment, arousing a patriotic and rights-protecting wave among the people of the country. This movement was entirely the automatic action of patriotic people and could not be instigated by the right-wing elements of the Kuomintang. Comparing this natural patriotic movement with the anti-American movement currently promoted by the Communist Party, unbiased American friends should be able to understand which is the true public opinion. And the facts can prove that the Kuomintang not only does not want to destroy the agreement jointly agreed upon by all parties in the country but still hopes to implement it. Chairman Chiang has repeatedly delivered speeches, all of which emphasize the implementation of the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and urge the Communist Party and other parties to elect representatives to the National Assembly and members of the National Government, which is not just once, and has ordered a ceasefire several times. It can be seen that the government's "political democratization" has long been moving towards the goal, and it has already begun to implement the "nationalization of the army" by reducing the size of the army. However, the Communist Party is neither willing to unify its troops according to the plan nor willing to participate in the National Assembly or the National Government. Therefore, it is clear who is responsible for obstructing the implementation of the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference.

Second, Mr. Fairbank observes the Chinese people with a capitalist eye, believing that what the Chinese people urgently need is economic democracy, not political democracy. He said, "A person only thinks about freedom of speech after he has eaten his fill." He also said, "We find that they (the Communists) are the most effective advocates of protecting the economic welfare of farmers. Because they can help farmers obtain their economic needs, they can obtain the political support of the farmers." We completely disagree with this statement because we believe that political democracy (the Principle of Democracy) and economic democracy (the Principle of People's Livelihood) are two sides of the same coin and cannot be separated. In addition to these two kinds of democracy, there is also national democracy (that is, nationalism), which is also an essential meaning that cannot be ignored. The reason why we resisted for eight years, persevering and unyielding, was because of this spirit. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the country, first created the Three Principles of the People, which emphasized these three kinds of democracy at the same time and consistently. The reason for this is also here. At the same time, can the Communist Party's "political capital" really seek welfare for farmers? It can also be evidenced by the clear facts. According to the actual situation in the Communist-occupied areas of northern Jiangsu, the Communist Party only knows how to destroy, but does not know how to build, and has killed, burned, and looted the entire northern Jiangsu, making the general farmers willing to become pitiful and helpless refugees, wandering in other places, rather than staying in their hometowns to be the meat on the Communist Party's chopping board, allowing them to slaughter them. The millions of refugees from northern Jiangsu crowding the Shanghai and Nanjing area are an undeniable ironclad proof. As for the politics of Yan'an, in the past, it closed the door and acted as a theatrical director, which may have deceived some foreigners, but over time, it has become widely known that there is absolutely no democracy. American female reporter Anna Louise Strong recently wrote to The New York Times, also saying that there is no democratic atmosphere in Yan'an. We do not know how Mr. Fairbank can defend the Communist Party?

Third, Mr. Fairbank points out that the Kuomintang after Chiang took office has become a conservative party. The reasons he bases this on are threefold: ãThe same few figures always occupy important positions in the government; ãThere is no plan to improve the lives of farmers; ãThe government is in collusion with large landowners and financial manipulators and is afraid of revolution. These words are truly "false in words and plausible in argument," seemingly right but actually wrong. Today, the Kuomintang has become a vast composite, and the Three Principles of the People have become the catchphrase of the whole country. There may inevitably be a small number of stragglers in the Kuomintang, but what party can avoid a small number of stragglers? Otherwise, why did the Soviet Union need to purge the party? Therefore, from a broad perspective, the Kuomintang is still a progressive revolutionary party, which not only has the Three Principles of the People that are suitable for the national conditions and are unanimously believed by the people of the country but also has a glorious history, and leading the War of Resistance has even more brilliant achievements. As long as there is no external obstruction and it is allowed to preside over the country's administration and seek progress in stability, there is no problem in gradually implementing the Three Principles of the People and improving the lives of the general public. Moreover, the general enlightened party members have long launched a party-government reform movement, and regardless of how difficult the current environment is, they are still overcoming all difficulties and approaching the people every day. The establishment of local public opinion organs makes stern criticisms of the government in general, and the central authorities are also planning the implementation plan for rural land reform and the large-scale promotion of the cooperative system. All of these show that the Kuomintang is always moving in the direction of progress. However, the progress that the Kuomintang requires is to be sought in stabilizing social order. The Communist Party, however, disregards everything and destroys order before talking about anything else. May I ask, which one do we want? What Mr. Fairbank calls "conservative," I don't know what he is referring to. If seeking progress in stability is considered conservative, then may I ask Mr. Fairbank, are today's American Truman government and the British Labour government also considered conservative governments? And is it necessary to learn from the Soviet Union's great revolution of 1917 to be considered a progressive government?

Finally, we must state one point: Mr. Fairbank, in the United States, which has freedom of speech, is free to express his political views on American policy toward China, which is commonplace and not worth paying attention to. However, Mr. Fairbank did not spend a short time in China and was responsible for communicating the opinions of the Chinese and American people. Now, he has published this kind of "obviously unfair" speech, which we cannot but regret. We are reminded that Wallace once visited China as Vice President and, after returning to China, reported his impressions, meaning that the National Government in Chongqing at that time would soon collapse economically, and even politically. This observation even made President Roosevelt feel bewildered for a time. Thinking about it now, a cursory glance is certainly not seeing the truth, and a superficial scratch is inevitably unrealistic. We always feel that there is a common flaw in the comments of American leftists on Chinese politics, that is, their prejudices are too deep, and they insist on measuring the politics of other countries with their own standards. Compared with the observations of legal scholar Pound, they cannot be compared. It is necessary to know that the development and evolution of the politics of various countries have their own certain trajectories, and the traditional social environment is an even more decisive factor. If foreign commentators cannot face reality and blindly base their views on their already formed ideology, then what they see will inevitably lead to illusions. We can ignore Fairbank's illusion alone, but we cannot let him cause estrangement between China and the United States.

### Turkey's Determination to Defend Sovereignty: Unwavering Stance on Rejecting Soviet Co-Management of Straits

[French News Agency, Moscow, 28th] Regarding the Turkish Straits issue, the Soviet Union on the 24th of this month once again issued a note to the Turkish government, insisting on the need for joint Soviet-Turkish defense of the Dardanelles Strait.

[Associated Press, Istanbul, 28th] According to highly reliable sources today, "extraordinary events may occur." Turkish troops are ready and prepared to respond. This observation stems from Moscow Radio's broad assertion that the Soviet Union is seeking a new treaty among Black Sea nations for the joint defense of the Dardanelles Strait. The Turkish government has become very pessimistic in recent days, with a sense that a storm is brewing. However, Turkey is prepared for any eventuality. Frankly speaking, Turkey is determined to defend its sovereignty, and if attacked, it can start fighting within five minutes. According to Moscow Radio broadcasts, the Soviet Union issued a note to Turkey on September 24, insisting on revising the Montreux Convention, jointly managing the Dardanelles Strait, and warning Turkey not to collude with non-Black Sea countries in military actions. This second demand was not known to the outside world until Moscow Radio broadcast it. Turkish officials have not yet made any formal statement on this.

[French News Agency, London, 28th] The Foreign Office has declared that the British government still adheres to the principles of the Montreux Convention and does not agree with the views expressed by Moscow Radio this morning regarding the Straits issue. According to this view, the Montreux Convention will be replaced by the Potsdam Agreement. In short, we believe that the Montreux Convention cannot be amended without the consent of the signatory states and the United States.

### Soviet Union Demands Internationalization of Ruhr, Accuses Britain and the United States of Violating the Potsdam Agreement

[French News Agency, Moscow, 29th] A Moscow Radio broadcast statement accused Britain and the United States of violating the Potsdam Agreement. It stated briefly that the fundamental goal of the Soviet Union's policy towards Germany is to democratize and disarm Germany to prevent any new German aggression. In this regard, it is necessary to ensure that the Potsdam Agreement is implemented in all German occupation zones. The Soviet Union's demand to place the Ruhr industrial area (currently occupied by British forces) under international control is precisely for this reason, as the Ruhr industrial area is the foundation of German militarism. This principle has not been accepted by other occupying powers, so the Soviet Union cannot be solely blamed if it does not implement it. All military organizations in the Soviet occupation zone have been disbanded, all Nazis and Fascists have been expelled from administrative organs, and no factories can be used for military purposes. Conversely, other occupation zones cannot do the same, which is unfortunate. Britain and the United States are attempting to establish a "Western Bloc" or "United States of Europe," aiming to overthrow the Potsdam Agreement, which is a necessary guarantee for peace and cannot be overturned.

### Churchill and Daughter Return to England

[French News Agency, Paris, 29th] Former British Prime Minister Churchill arrived here yesterday from Beijing and took a morning flight back to London today with his daughter Mary.

### Atomic Energy Control Divided into Three Stages: Technical Team Drafts Plan

[French News Agency, Lake Success, New York, 28th] The technical subcommittee of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission has drafted an international atomic energy control plan and submitted it to the committee for discussion this morning. The plan is divided into three stages: (1) control of atomic energy ore mining; (2) control of refining uranium from ore; (3) control of atomic energy refining in industry. In the first stage, control is easier because the scope of the mining enterprises involved is small. However, in the third stage, controlling the smelting of ore is more difficult. When smelting ore, it is necessary to set a limit for natural losses, otherwise, fraud is inevitable. The greatest difficulty lies in the third stage, as various equipment for radiating atomic energy can be slightly modified to switch from peacetime use to wartime use in a very short time.

### Britain Launches UN Week, Urges People to Value the UN Organization, and Eliminate International Suspicion Through Knowledge and Reason

[Central News Agency, London, 28th] King George of England, Prime Minister Attlee, Churchill, and many other leaders in the United States have sent congratulatory messages to wish the United Nations Association of Great Britain success in hosting United Nations Week, which begins tomorrow and lasts until the 6th of next month. During United Nations Week, which begins tomorrow throughout England, special prayers will be held in churches, and there will be torchlight parades, mass demonstrations, concerts, and various exhibitions to promote public awareness and support for the United Nations organization. This movement is jointly organized by 500 branches of the United Nations Association of Great Britain, and its stated goal is to "eliminate mutual suspicion among nations through knowledge and reason, and the free exchange of ideas and opinions."

[Reuters, London, 28th] Britain will begin holding United Nations Week tomorrow. Prime Minister Attlee issued a statement stating that the government has repeatedly stated its emphasis on the United Nations organization. If all countries can view the United Nations Charter as a system for developing their national goals to serve all of humanity, it will not be difficult to bring peace and happiness to the world. Foreign Minister Bevin also said that the world still needs to learn more about the relationship between national and international interests.

### Indian Representative in Paris Meets with Molotov

Expresses Friendship with the Soviet Union

[Our Report] London, 29th Radio: Indian Provisional Government Representative Menon met with Molotov in Paris yesterday and flew to London today. It is said that the meeting was fruitful and expressed India's willingness to be friendly with all countries in the world, including the Soviet Union. Menon solemnly stated that the Indian government's foreign policy has no intention of being "partial."

### Truman Delivers Speech, Reaffirms Belief in Peace: Mao Youtao and Others Advocate a Summit of the Big Three

[Central News Agency, New York, 29th, United Press] President Truman, while attending the West Point football game yesterday, told the students and staff of the school that he believed that "permanent peace" could be achieved after the war. Marshal Marshall is the highest example of a soldier, and he is engaged in the most important work for the country in peacetime. After Stalin stated his belief in peace, Truman reaffirmed his same belief in peace today. He said, "We firmly believe that there will be lasting peace, and peace is the goal of our work."

[United Press, Chicago, 28th] Former Roosevelt cabinet members Ickes and Mao Youtao, in a speech at the 31-state Liberal Party meeting, called on President Truman to hold a meeting with Attlee and Stalin to quickly end the astonishing war negotiations.

### New Rebellion in the Philippines: 5,000 Radicals Issue Anti-Government Declaration

[Associated Press, Manila, 29th] A rebellion broke out today in Laguna Province, north of Manila. A small group of Filipinos issued a declaration advocating the overthrow of President Roxas and his government. Laguna Province Governor Panchian reported that the group were all "radicals," totaling 5,000 people, calling themselves "National Guards," threatening to execute him. He expects the military police to be able to "deal with the rebellion." He has received a letter from the organization stating that its purpose is to overthrow the Roxas government, which is "controlled by American imperialists and foreign fascists." Panchian said that the movement is mostly composed of guerrillas dissatisfied with the government, and their activities have so far been limited to occasional attacks on isolated villages.

### Greek Prime Minister Forms New Cabinet

[French News Agency, Athens, 28th] Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris recently met with the King and tendered the resignation of the cabinet. The King then ordered him to form a new cabinet.

### Bulgaria Issues Amnesty Decree

[TASS, Sofia, 28th] The Presidium of the Bulgarian Parliament, which is temporarily acting as head of state, issued an order reducing the sentences of prisoners of all levels. Nine different types of sentences have been ordered to be pardoned. Those sentenced to more than five years for violating people's customs, national defense laws, or taking advantage of opportunities for profit are not eligible for amnesty. A total of 2,462 criminals were pardoned, including 1,662 political prisoners and 800 other criminals.

### King Downgraded to Commoner: Grandfather and Grandson Share the Same Fate

[French News Agency, Alexandria, 29th] Bulgarian King Simeon, who was forced to abdicate, and the Queen Mother arrived here today from Istanbul as refugees. The mother and son were dressed simply, and the authorities initially did not pay attention to them. They were welcomed by a representative of the Egyptian King upon arrival. The group then drove to Ras El-Tin Palace, where the first to greet them was Simeon's grandfather, former Egyptian King Ahmed Fuad, who embraced his grandson in a sorrowful reunion.

### Crimes Inescapable: Nazi War Criminal Entrusts Orphans

[French News Agency, Nuremberg, 28th] The trials of the 21 German war criminals in Nuremberg Prison have been completed and sentences will be announced soon, with most of them facing the death penalty. The court authorities, showing leniency, allowed each prisoner to meet with his wife for one hour on the 28th and 29th to entrust final words. Originally, only half an hour was allowed for the meeting.

### New French Constitution Draft

Passed by the Constituent Assembly, to be put to a citizen vote next month.

[French News Agency, Paris, 29th] The French Constituent Assembly today finally passed the full text of the new draft constitution by a vote of 440 to 106. This is the result of a compromise between the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the Popular Republican Movement. The new constitution is scheduled for a referendum on the 13th of next month.

[Our Report] Paris, 29th Radio, Abbey Nor report: General de Gaulle declared here today that although he had criticized the draft constitution, he did not specifically ask the French people to reject it. He spoke in his personal capacity, not on behalf of the party.

### 1919, 1946: A Comparison of the Two Paris Peace Conferences (Part 2)

â Lu Yu

(5) Differences in Personnel

In comparing the personnel of the two Paris Peace Conferences, the following three points are worth noting: first, the charisma and skills of the leaders themselves; second, the cooperative relationship between the leaders; and third, the selection of the US delegation. The most important figures at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference were the well-known "Big Three"âUS President Wilson, British Prime Minister Lloyd George, and French Prime Minister Clemenceau. These three, whether in terms of international prestige, domestic standing, or achievements, can be said to be the first-class politicians of the World War I era. In particular, President Wilson's idealism, Prime Minister George's diplomatic skills, and Prime Minister Clemenceau's patriotic enthusiasm were most praised. Looking back at the representatives of the major powers attending this conference, such as US Secretary of State Byrnes, British Foreign Minister Bevin, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, and French President Bidault, in terms of both prestige and domestic positions, they are far inferior to the "Big Three" of the previous conference. This fact makes today's conference less impressive. As I write this, I cannot help but feel a sense of desolation and regret the early death of the late President Roosevelt and the defeat of former Prime Minister Churchill. As for the cooperative relationship between the leaders, this conference is far less harmonious than the last conference. The reasons for this have been briefly mentioned above. In short, it is due to the tension between the East and West blocs, the severity of which far exceeds the opposition between the United States and France in the previous conference. Second, there is no leader on the international stage today with the lofty reputation of President Wilson in 1919. Byrnes, Bevin, and Molotov are all on par in terms of status, prestige, and achievements, and no one is likely to yield to the other. Third, both Bevin of Britain and Molotov of the Soviet Union are internationally known for their quick tempers and hotheads, and arguments between the two can easily become heated. This has a negative impact on the smooth progress of the conference. As for the selection of the US delegation to this conference, it is worth noting for the following reasons: The reason for President Wilson's failure last time was that when he went to Paris, he did not include any Republican officials in his entourage. Therefore, the US delegation at that time represented only the Democratic Party, not the entire United States. After President Wilson returned from overseas, the Treaty of Versailles was not accepted by the Senate, which was dominated by the Republican Party. As a result, President Wilson died with regret, and the United States failed to join the League of Nations. This time, President Truman, in order to avoid repeating the same mistakes, in addition to sending Secretary of State Byrnes as the chief representative, also sent Democratic Party official Senator Connally, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Republican Party official Senator Vandenberg as representatives to participate in the conference together. As such, the US delegation to this conference represents the entire country of the United States, not just the ruling Democratic Party. This is extremely important for the future ratification of the treaty by the US Senate.

Conclusion

In summary, comparing the two Paris Peace Conferences, we can draw the following conclusions: First, the international situation as the background to the conference is far more tense and serious in 1946 than in 1919. Second, in terms of the conference's tasks, scope, and powers, this conference is subject to strict limitations. Third, in terms of the organizational structure of the conference, this conference is far simpler than the previous one. Fourth, as for the people attending the conference, the representatives of today's conference are far inferior to the "Big Three" of 26 years ago. Because of the above, the reader may get the impression that the future of this conference is full of darkness and there is no hope of success. Should we adopt such a pessimistic attitude? I say, no. Although various phenomena indicate that this conference is inferior to the previous one in terms of "geographical advantage" and "human harmony," there is one important fact about "timing" that we must not ignore. That is, the world today has entered the atomic age. If a third world war breaks out, the result will not be who wins and who loses, but mutual destruction. The responsible authorities of all countries gathered at the Paris Peace Conference today should embrace the principle of "only success is allowed, failure is not allowed," be tolerant and accommodating to each other, to promote the completion of the treaty and the establishment of peace. This is not only related to the welfare of the people of other countries, but also for the survival of their own compatriots and descendants. This is what I want to loudly appeal to the representatives of the conference after comparing the differences between the two conferences.

### Two-Route Renovation Plan, Seven Major and Minor Projects: Initial Plan to Start Repairing Roadbed for 100 Kilometers Tomorrow, Expand McGon Road Freight Station, Build Jiaxing Subway Platform

The three-phase plan for the renovation of the two railways has been finalized. The first phase will officially begin tomorrow. This plan is divided into seven items: (1) Engineering improvement: repairing 100 kilometers of roadbed, rebuilding 12 road maintenance team houses, cleaning all ditches in the stations along the two routes, and building 30 railcars and hand-pushed flatcars each, and 57 single-wheel gravel carts. (2) Traffic construction: adding 40 pairs of inner station (i.e., inner flag) signals. (3) Improving order: adding 10,000 meters of sheds to stations along the two routes, rebuilding and repairing various stations. (4) Improving passenger transport facilities: building Jiaxing subway platforms, adding rain shelters to large and small stations along the two routes, 4,500 square meters. (5) Improving freight transport facilities: expanding the entire McGon Road Freight Station project. (6) Improving the machine section: converting the Hangzhou locomotive house into a passenger and freight car house, expanding the entire house project, and adding a water pool to the Shanghai North Station. (7) Expanding the Qishuyan Vehicle Factory: this project will be divided into four months from October 1st to the end of January next year. The second and third months will be used for re-examination. The budget for the above entire project is a total of 2.315 billion. The second phase of the plan will begin in early March next year, and will be purely for rebuilding traffic equipment, such as electrical signals. The third phase of the plan will be implemented in early October next year, which will be to re-examine all the projects in the first and second phases, and then make improvements and supplements. The entire plan is expected to be completed in early March of the 37th year. Director Chen Bozhuang of the Bureau took the Beijing-Shanghai night express train at 10 o'clock last night, carrying the three-phase renovation plan and the general budget to the Ministry for review and approval.

### Council Delegation to Petition in Beijing: "Cultivating Shanghai's Industry and Commerce is Like Gardeners Planting Flowers," Awaiting Pest Control, Irrigation, and Fertilization

[Our Report] The Municipal Councilors-organized petition delegation to Beijing, appealing to the government to improve the city's financial policies. It is reported that among the 11 members of the delegation, Xu Guomao and Luo Qinghua took the express train to Beijing yesterday, and Xu Jiyi plans to go to Beijing early this morning. Others such as Jin Runyang, Liu Jingji, Yang Fusheng, Yu Zuoting, Wang Yansong, Xi Yushu, Tao Baichuan, and Wang Xianqing plan to go to Beijing tonight. All members of the delegation are scheduled to gather at the Zhejiang Industrial Bank in Nanjing at 9 am tomorrow, and then proceed to petition the government.

[Another Report] This reporter interviewed representative Yang Fusheng yesterday. According to him, this trip to Beijing to petition represents the expectations of the city's industry and commerce. The effect may not be certain, but he hopes that the government authorities will change their past erroneous views and no longer regard the city as a source of profit to be exploited. It should be known that the city's industry and commerce, whether in the past, present, or future, is undeniably the economic center of the country, like a rare flower. If it can be helped to grow and develop as much as possible, then bright and beautiful fruits will be able to spread their excellent seeds throughout the country, so that the entire national economy can be stabilized. Therefore, the central government should regard itself as a gardener, reversing the previous attitude of taking and using. Eliminating harsh and miscellaneous taxes, rectifying officials, that is the work of pest control. Loosening funds, adjusting tariffs, that is fertilization and irrigation. If the government does not think of the country and the nation and continues as before, with officials competing with the people for profit and the central government competing with the local governments for profit, and cutting down at every turn, not only will the city's economy decline, which can be counted on the days, but also there will be no hope for national construction. I know that the authorities may not know this unwise thing, then the result of this trip will definitely change the authorities' views, for the city and the country, considering the will of the people, no longer perfunctory, and at the same time hope that public opinion will consistently support, so that the delegation does not make this trip in vain.

### Investigation Team Ends Today, Unfinished Cases to be Handled in Beijing

The reception work investigation team, previously based on a tip-off accusing the municipal government's receiving materials management office of corruption in bidding and falsely labeling 4 billion yuan worth of materials for the Central Market, had handed over all the files to the auditing office for review, which has not yet been completed.

### Changxing Coal Mine Needs to be Restored Urgently: Wang Xiaolai Returns to Shanghai to Talk

[Our Report] Wang Xiaolai went to Hangzhou on official business ten days ago and returned to Shanghai a few days ago. He told this reporter that the main task of this trip was to accompany the chief metallurgical engineer to survey the Changxing Coal Mine. According to reports, the coal reserves in this mine are very rich. Unfortunately, it was destroyed by the war. After an investigation, it is estimated that if actively repaired, it will take at least one to five months to produce coal. If the regular coal production is restored, the fuel required for power in Shanghai, Suzhou, Wuxi, and other places can be supplied continuously without worrying about shortage. In addition, regarding the Qiantang River ferry, a restoration committee will be established to plan and build pedestrian docks on both the north and south banks of the Qiantang River. In addition, he had handled the highway passenger transport affairs of Zhejiang Province on behalf of the Southeast Motor Company. Generally speaking, the highway passenger transport affairs previously handled by the Highway Bureau will be handled by the company in the future.

The receiving address is still the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau General Business Office at 70 Fuzhou Road.

### Benefiting the Poor and Sick: Emergency Medical Loan Association, 21 Designated Hospitals, Starting to Receive Patients Tomorrow

[Our Report] The city's Emergency Medical Loan Association, initiated by Gu Qianlin and others, was established in view of the fact that poor citizens often encounter urgent illnesses or unexpected events and need to be sent to hospitals for emergency treatment or surgery, but are often rejected by the hospital because they are unable to raise all the expenses in time, resulting in delays in life. Therefore, the association was specially organized, with Rong Hongyuan, Wang Tongyuan, Wang Qin Sun, Wu Zhongyi, Tang Xinghai, Xue Zuheng, Tang Shuming, Lu Jusen, and Gu Qianlin serving as executive directors.

Regarding the loan procedures, when a citizen encounters a disease or an accident, the patient can be sent to a nearby hospital designated by the association for emergency treatment. The hospital should provide emergency treatment to the patient upon receiving him, regardless of whether he can pay all or part of the medicine expenses. On the one hand, contact the patient's buyer in charge to handle the payment procedures. If assistance is indeed needed, the hospital will notify the association to guarantee payment. However, patients who obtain loans should repay the association as soon as possible after being treated, recovering, and safely discharged from the hospital, if their economic ability is sufficient to repay within a reasonable period of time, in order to benefit other patients. As for all investigation matters, the association will hire a number of visitors to be responsible at any time.

The association has now designated Zhongde Hospital, Ximen Women and Children's Hospital, Jardine Hospital, Tongde Hospital, Guangci Hospital, the First Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross, Tongren Hospital, Kemei Obstetrics Hospital, Deji Hospital, Nanyang Hospital, Dagong Hospital, Hongren Hospital, Sino-American Hospital, Labor Hospital, Southeast Hospital, and the Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Municipal Hospitals, Municipal People's Hospital, and Municipal Obstetrics Hospital, a total of 21 hospitals, will start accepting patients with emergency medical loans from October 1st.

The loan fund is contributed by the directors, and Gu Qianlin is responsible for all administrative expenses. Donations from all walks of life are also welcome.

### After De Wu and Mi Jia were Imprisoned, Tai Xu Presided Over Jing'an Temple

[Our Report] Abbot De Wu and supervisor Mi Jia of Jing'an Temple were accused of treason. After seven investigations by the High Court, they were detained and imprisoned. The temple affairs are now temporarily presided over by Master Tai Xu. In addition, deputy abbot Miao Ran, Bai Sheng of the Buddhist Association, and others are jointly responsible. It is said that the temple belongs to the lineage of the grandson jungle school (that is, the abbot passes on to his disciples). Before the court's verdict on De Wu, the position of abbot will not be changed for the time being.

### Hand Grenade from the Sky: The Entirety of Baxianfang Terrified

[Report from our Newspaper] Hu Zimei, a native of Anhui, runs the Hu Ziji Shen Zhuang at No. 30 Baxianfang, Baxianqiao, Zikai'er Road, specializing in transporting yarn and cloth for the Anqing gang. Yesterday, a little after 2:00 PM, Hu's wife was sitting idly in the side room when suddenly a loud crash was heard from the main room, shaking the entire neighborhood. Neighbors gathered to inquire and discovered a hole pierced through the floorboards of the mezzanine. Looking down at the floor, they found an iron hand grenade, shaped like a porcelain lightbulb, near the wall. Fortunately, no one was injured. Someone reported the incident to the Taishan Precinct, which dispatched police to investigate. The grenade fell from the sky, destroying three yellow roof tiles, penetrating the ceiling of the roof, the floorboards of the second floor, and the floorboards of the mezzanine before landing on the ground, also creating a hole in the floor. It is said that a minute before the incident, an airplane had passed overhead, so it is generally believed that the grenade may have fallen from the plane.

### Rickshaw Puller's Black Heart: Flees with Millions in Funds; Envies the Owner's Business and Purchases Large Quantities of Cigarettes to Start His Own Business

[Report from our Newspaper] Wang Rongxin, the owner of the Xin Da Tobacco Company at the intersection of Ningbo Road and Guizhou Road, instructed his apprentice, Yang Liangmin, to take a chartered rickshaw driven by Zhou Tingxiu, a native of Haimen, to deliver 10 million in legal tender to the Kunming Bank and 6 million to the Dunyu Money Exchange at around 4:00 PM on the 16th. They first arrived at the Dunyu Money Exchange, where Yang instructed the rickshaw puller, Zhou Tingxiu, to stop the rickshaw outside the door and told him to watch the 10 million on the rickshaw carefully. He then went inside to make the deposit. When he came out, Zhou Tingxiu had already fled with the rickshaw and its contents. Yang returned to the tobacco company and reported to the owner, Wang Rongxin, who sent people to search everywhere without success and then reported the theft to the Huangpu Precinct. Li Yinmin, the head of the Criminal Division, dispatched police to investigate. He also ordered officers Song Yuanshan and Yao Fuzhang, along with officer Ju Xingmei, to search along the Jinghu Railway line, but they were unable to find him. Later, they discovered that his father, Zhou Fengshan (54 years old), lived at No. 412 Zhaofuli, Binyou. They also found the chartered rickshaw from the Xin Da Tobacco Company parked under a building in Guojialou. They took Zhou Fengshan to the precinct for questioning, but he revealed nothing. Yesterday afternoon at around 3:00 PM, Officer Li received a tip that Zhou Tingxiu had boarded a ship and was planning to go to Qinglong Port in Haimen. He immediately ordered officers to rush there and apprehend him. They found a new leather suitcase containing over one million in legal tender. During questioning at the precinct, Zhou confessed that he had used over three million in legal tender to purchase cigarettes, which he had stored in Qinglong Port. The precinct plans to dispatch officers within the next few days to escort the suspect to Qinglong Port to retrieve the stolen goods for investigation and prosecution.

According to news from the Shanghai Housing Rental Committee yesterday, the draft of the revised housing rental management regulations formulated by the committee has been approved by the municipal government and submitted to the Executive Yuan for transfer to the National Defense Council. Once approved by the council, it will be implemented. It is said that the main feature of the draft is to strengthen the authority of the committee. Currently, the committee's authority is limited to mediation and it does not have the power to adjudicate. Mediation requires the consent of both parties. If it had the power to adjudicate, the resolution of cases would be greatly facilitated.

### Living Expenses for Families of Traitors: Paid in Cash; Clothing Can Be Claimed

Since its establishment, the Committee for the Management of Property of Traitors has begun to sell the property of major traitors in batches. Starting this month, the committee will conduct investigations and manage all properties of traitors in this city that have been judged by the High Court, and will tally the actual value of these properties for separate auctions. It is understood that the legally reserved living expenses for the families of traitors will be determined by the Ministry of Justice and Administrative Affairs and paid in cash, rather than distributed as property. Recently, the families of traitors who have been tried and sentenced have reported to the committee that their clothes have been confiscated and that they have no warm clothes for the upcoming cooler weather, requesting permission to have them returned. It is now known that the committee has decided that, except for the clothes of the traitors themselves, the clothing needed by their families can be unsealed and claimed as appropriate.

Losses included nine rolls of wool fabric, 28 boxes of Morris cigarettes, and one radio, totaling 33,385,000 yuan, which is not as large as rumored.

### Revival of "Big Sister" Dance Hostesses: Bad Practices Gradually Becoming Obvious Again

The "big sister" dance hostesses in the city's dance halls had largely disappeared after Director Xuan of the Municipal Police Bureau strictly prohibited them. However, these groups still wield considerable influence. All job-seeking dance hostesses are still under their control, so "big sister" dance hostesses continue to exist in the dance halls. The large ones manage five or six dancers, while smaller ones manage three or four. They have simply changed their titles to "managers" or "floor staff." If a customer wants to invite a certain dance hostess to sit with them, they must first sign a list and give it to the waiter, who gives it to the dance hostess's "big sister." The "big sister" then leads the dance hostess to the tea room, from where the waiter leads her to the customer. The practice of paying a fixed fee is also gradually re-emerging.

### Impersonating a Military Officer to Transport Opium

Huang Laosan, the kingpin of opium trafficking in North China, alias Cai Qing, 26 years old, from Beiping, impersonated a lieutenant colonel and deputy director of the Rear Service Headquarters. On September 1, he brought a large quantity of opium to Shanghai from Nanjing. He evaded inspection by military police at the North Railway Station by posing as a military officer. He hired a Xiang Sheng taxi to go to Yuandang Road. When the taxi reached the intersection of Beihai Road and Hubei Road, he was discovered by police officer Yu Rong, who confiscated a large quantity of opium on the spot. After strict questioning at the precinct, he confessed without hesitation. He was immediately handed over to the military law office of the garrison headquarters for legal proceedings.

### Jeeps, Big and Small, Dash About in Chaos: Pedestrians on the Road Fear for Their Lives

[Report from our Newspaper] Li Lianghai, 33 years old, from Changzhou, was passing the intersection of North Zhejiang Road and Qipu Road at 9:30 AM yesterday when he was hit by a jeep driven by Engineer Liu of the Ministry of Communications. Three fingers on his left hand were crushed on the spot, and both of his legs were seriously injured. The officer on duty immediately called for an ambulance, which took him to the Public Hospital for treatment. His condition is critical.

Xu Zha, a milk deliveryman for the Da Xin Milk Booth (a local resident, 26 years old), was riding his bicycle past the intersection of Pushe Road and Sacred Heart Road yesterday morning when he was suddenly run over by a truck from the Public Works Bureau.

### City Councilors Touring the Sky: Looking Down at the Lower World from an Airplane; Height Obscures Crime and Disorder

[Special Report from our Newspaper] Reflecting on the bleak past of China's aviation industry, one cannot help but feel that China's progress in aviation in recent years can be described as "leaps and bounds." This is, of course, a general statement. Compared to the civilized countries of Europe, the difference is too great. In the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom, inviting the press to fly in the air has long become a historical relic. But in China, to this day, it still retains some of its appeal.

Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, the Mountain Country Airlines hosted the city councilors of this city for an aerial tour at Longhua Airport. The number of people who attended was unexpectedly crowded. In total, there were over 100 city councilors, over 60 City Council staff, and 100 members of the Aviation Construction Committee and guests. The company allocated two C47 transport aircraft, which flew in several batches, personally piloted by Chen Hongen, the director of the flight team.

The reporter waited from 8:30 AM until 11:30 AM before finally getting on the last flight. The weather was particularly good yesterday, and the temperature in the plane was also very normal. Having never flown before, I often heard people say how cold it was inside a plane, but yesterday, while circling in the air for a quarter of an hour, I never felt the slightest bit of cold. This was probably because we were flying particularly low. Our plane took off from Longhua Airport heading south, crossed the Huangpu River, turned east over Pudong, and reached Wusongkou and Chongming Island, before turning north back to the airport. Seeing Shanghai from the high altitude is more beautiful than ever! All the sins, turbidity, and disorder are obscured. Even Nanjing Road, which is usually the most chaotic in terms of traffic, felt lovely. As the plane crossed the racecourse, the four large characters "Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and Shame" on the top of the International Hotel were clearly visible. However, fifteen minutes later, when I returned to this den of sin, I felt that it was still the sharpest satire.

"Sky Tours" can still give us a novel feeling today, even though in the past twenty years, we have had many airports, scheduled flights, and our own pilots. However, this is still not enough. As the United States has already completed the construction of a giant, ultra-heavy, ultra-high-altitude aircraft with eight engines, how should we be vigilant about our backwardness and catch up quickly!

Now, the National Leading Pilots Committee, the Shipping Guild, the Logistics Department, the First District Supply Command, and the Port Quarantine Station have also joined, bringing the total to twenty-one units. In the future, efforts will be concentrated and strengthened to eliminate theft at the docks, dredge the Huangpu River, and alleviate the congestion of docks and warehouses. This will play a significant role in promoting the city's foreign import and export trade.

### Girl Commits Suicide: Two Dead, One Alive

[Report from our Newspaper] Yesterday afternoon, a young woman suddenly jumped off the roof of the Carlton Apartment, falling directly onto a passing pedicab, killing her instantly. It is reported that the deceased was wearing fashionable clothes, and the cause of her suicide and her name are being investigated by the police.

[Another Report] Jin Xingmei, a 17-year-old girl from Ningbo, lived with her mother at No. 107 Tongrenli, Tiantong Road. She attempted suicide by swallowing a gold ring last night at 7:00 PM due to a minor matter. Fortunately, her mother discovered her in time and rushed her to the Public Hospital for emergency treatment. She was out of danger by late at night.

[Another Report] Fan Zhenqin, a 29-year-old girl from Suzhou, lived at No. 70 Shunheli, Tiantong Road, North Jiangxi Road, Hongkou. Yesterday morning at 7:30 AM, she was scolded by her mother, Ms. Lu, due to a minor matter. In a fit of anger, she became despondent and secretly swallowed Lysol to commit suicide. Later, her family discovered her and rushed her to the hospital for treatment. However, because she had ingested too much poison, she died shortly after arriving at the hospital. The body has been sent to the coroner's office for examination pending verification.

### On the Wedding Night: Robbers Came to Die

[Report from our Newspaper] On the night before last, Zhang Xiangsheng's home at No. 15 Deanli, Tongbei Road, was celebrating the wedding of his younger brother, Xiangfu. Guests filled the house, and the party continued late into the night. Suddenly, five robbers, each armed with guns, rushed into the house and forced the bride, groom, and guests to hand over all their valuables. While they were robbing, several courageous guests seized the opportunity to grab two of the robbers. At that moment, one of the robbers acting as a lookout fired his gun, and a bullet accidentally hit his accomplice in the left chest, who immediately fell to the ground. The captured robbers were eventually able to escape. The robbers were also panicked by this point and fled through the door. Patrol officers from the Garrison Headquarters Water Patrol happened to be passing by and, hearing the commotion, bravely stepped forward and apprehended the two robbers, seizing a six-inch pistol with twenty-five rounds of ammunition still in the chamber, as well as a wooden holster and five rounds of ammunition. The remaining robbers took the opportunity to escape. The captured robbers were taken to the precinct for questioning. One identified himself as Zhang Jinfa, a 29-year-old from Tianjin, residing at No. 26 Tongxingli, Kunming Road, Da Niwan Road. The other identified himself as Liu Yan, a 36-year-old from Hubei. The injured robber, named Peng Hui, was sent to the police hospital but died shortly after arriving due to the severity of his injuries. The remaining robbers are still being pursued.

### Shanghai's Nurseries: YMCA Has a Long History; Children's Health Institute Is an Up-and-Coming Star; "Too Few Nurseries, Too Many Children" Still Needs Widespread Establishment

[Special Report from our Newspaper] The slogan "Equality between men and women" has been shouted for who knows how many years, but have men and women truly become equal? There's no need to argue; just casually take the most fashionable city councilors as an example. Out of a total of one hundred and seventy-eight distinguished councilors, women only account for five, which is a ratio of thirty-five to one. This is just one example at hand; in fact, there are countless such examples in this country. Precisely because there are too many, no one finds it strange. Isn't that so? When have you ever heard someone ask, "Why is it that among the city councilors representing the people, only one out of thirty-five is female?"

Rather than scolding, "Women are the least ambitious," it is more practical and pertinent to say, "This society does not give women the opportunity to be ambitious." Leaving aside the current society's discrimination and exclusion of women, due to the underdevelopment of public services, women's "marriage and career" has formed a sharp contradiction. Marriage becomes a lifelong prison for women. However, people cannot violate nature after all; marriage is originally one of the major events in life. And difficulties also follow. Oil, salt, firewood, and vinegar are minor matters; raising children is a major matter. Handing over the chubby, healthy child to an illiterate nanny always feels unsettling. Thus, great maternal love calls a mother to sacrifice everything and raise her children wholeheartedly. Whatever talent and special skill she may have is all buried in the small circle of life.

Therefore, in today's world where "nurseries" are not yet widespread, women have no future, and "equality between men and women" will forever be just a beautiful dream!

Speaking of nurseries in Shanghai, they are truly as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. The one with the longest history is probably the one run by the YWCA. It is said that the results are not bad, but the scope is too small, and not many people benefit from it. In addition, the Shanghai Municipal Children's Health Institute has also established nurseries to meet this need, temporarily limited to accepting infants aged three months to two years. Currently, public servants and business people account for the majority of the infants in foster care. Doctors, nurses, and other professionals are in charge of their care. The first location is at No. 10, Lane 173, North Sichuan Road, and the second location is at No. 7, Lane 24, North Haining Road. The most difficult problems currently faced by the institute are the issues of facilities and funding, because without spacious facilities and sufficient funding, it is difficult to achieve the ideal.

The cry for "establishing nurseries" may be deafening, but how much has been realized? It is reported that the women's community in this city has submitted a proposal to the City Council, requesting that a portion of the funds be allocated to establish nurseries. The City Council has also approved the allocation of a portion of the 900 million yuan in social relief funds as a special fund. It is hoped that this check can be cashed as soon as possible, and that "nurseries" can be established universally. This would be the gospel for all women and the fortune of the country. Conversely, if "nurseries" cannot develop, women will never have a chance to turn themselves around, to reiterate - China will never be rich and strong. Because no one can deny that the power of the two hundred million women who make up half of the total population is indispensable in the process of nation-building!

### Teaching and Research: Should Arithmetic Be Taught in the First Grade of Elementary School? Ministry of Education Orders National Education Association to Study

[Report from our Newspaper in Nanjing] After the establishment of the National Education Research Associations in various provinces and cities, meetings should be convened regularly in accordance with the General Outline of the Provincial and Municipal National Education Guidance Research Methods. National research issues are to be ordered and promulgated by the Ministry of Education at any time, and seven orders have already been issued. Now, the Ministry of Education has formulated the eighth set of four research questions, instructing the Education Departments and Bureaus of various provinces and cities to send copies to their subordinate National Education Research Associations for thorough study and limit the submission of research results to the Ministry for review by the end of June 1947. It is learned that one of the four research questions in the eighth set is: "Should arithmetic be taught in the first grade of elementary school?" According to the original instructions from the Ministry of Education, elementary school teachers generally find it difficult to teach arithmetic in the lower grades. Some argue that arithmetic should be taught starting in the second and third grades, while others argue that not only should teaching not be postponed, but the level should be raised and the content increased. Should arithmetic be taught in the first grade of elementary school? Please conduct a detailed review and state the reasons to provide a reference for revising the curriculum standards.

### Ministry of Education Petitions the Executive Yuan to Maintain Student Public Funding, Extending it to Next Summer

[Our Nanjing News] Public funding for students in secondary and higher education institutions originated as a wartime relief measure and was originally intended to be discontinued. However, due to the current practical economic difficulties faced by the people, it is still necessary to continue its maintenance. The Ministry of Education has already petitioned the Executive Yuan to maintain student public funding and extend it for one year, until next summer. Publicly funded students in national schools are divided into two types: full public funding and half public funding. The quota for new students with full public funding and half public funding has been changed to 30% each (originally 40%). However, publicly funded students who are veterans resuming their studies are not subject to the 30% limitation.

### Zhu Qiqian's Former Collection of Embroidered Items Transferred to the Central Museum

[Our Beiping 29th Dispatch] Zhu Qiqian, who held important positions during the Beijing government era, formerly collected over eighty exquisite pieces of silk embroidery from the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, which could be described as unparalleled within the country. Before the September 18th Incident, Zhu transferred all of these treasured embroidered items to the Palace Museum, but before they could be transported, the incident occurred, resulting in their confiscation by the Japanese invaders and designation as national treasures of the Puppet Manchukuo. Years ago, to celebrate the tenth anniversary of Manchukuo's founding, the embroidered items were transported to the Tokyo Imperial Museum in Japan for exhibition, at which time they were insured for a huge sum of 10 million Japanese yen. Now, after investigation and recovery by the government, they have all been transported from the Northeast to this area and will be transferred to the Central Museum for reception and safekeeping, so that these rare cultural relics can be passed down for a long time.

Then, Fu Tongxian, representing the guests, gave a speech, saying: "You students are extremely fortunate. Where does this fortune lie? There are three points: (1) a good principal, (2) good school buildings and facilities, and (3) good teachers. You should repay this kind of happiness. There are three ways to repay it: (1) be a model for millions of school children, be polite, observe order, and be reasonable, (2) mobilize out-of-school people to come to school, and (3) teach out-of-school people to read. If each of you more than two thousand students teaches one hundred people, then hundreds of thousands of people can be educated." Next, Huang Shijin spoke, and finally the students gave their thanks.

### The Performance Was Perfect, Sweeping the Heroes of Shanghai. The Qunsheng Team Crushed the Hualian Team Yesterday, With a Score of 66 to 45. The Hualian Team Was at a Loss. The Stadium Was Packed With Nearly 10,000 Fans.

[Our Report] The Qunsheng basketball team swept the heroes of Shanghai and was unexpectedly unstoppable. The Hualian team, the city champion, was also defeated miserably in a fierce battle last night, with a score of 66 to 45. In the first half, the visiting team took a ten-point lead with a score of 33 to 23. The Qunsheng team's performance was perfect, and the Hualian team was at a loss.

Unprecedented Spectacle

Nearly 10,000 fans rioted at the stadium last night. Pre-sale tickets were sold out in a quarter of an hour at 10:00 a.m. By 5:00 p.m., fans had already arrived in droves. By 6:30 p.m., the stadium was full, and thousands of people were denied entry. The gate was eventually broken down. The police station dispatched vehicles and opened the water supply to prevent accidents from happening. A large number of seats in the stadium were destroyed, and the order was extremely chaotic. Commander Xuan Tiewu entered the venue to watch and had to try every possible means. The spectacle far exceeded the National Games final, which is truly unprecedented. The Shanghai Radio Station broadcast the battle situation last night, which lasted until 9:00 p.m.

The More They Played, the Better They Got

The Qunsheng team played better and better. The ease of last night's victory was unexpected. The Hualian team appeared flustered and adopted a five-man zone defense. As a result, they were unable to attack and had loopholes everywhere in their defense. Their speed, shooting, and physical strength were all inferior, making it difficult to avoid defeat. Except for Wu Chengzhang, everyone else performed much worse than usual last night. After Li Zhenzhong was fouled out for the fifth time at 44 to 33 in the second half, Zhang Liangxiong replaced him, but there was still no development, and the entire army collapsed.

Unable to Resist

The referees were Liu Hesheng and Qu Honglu. The Qunsheng team's starting lineup was Chen Jinde, Chen Jinzhi, Cai Wenhua, Cai Wenzhang, and Yang Renhui. The Hualian team's starting lineup was Kong Guangyi, Li Zhenzhong, Bao Songyuan, Wu Chengzhang, and Chen Xuesong. The game time was divided into two halves, which was the first change for the Qunsheng team in Shanghai. Wu Chengzhang of the Hualian team scored first, followed by Cai Wenhua of Qunsheng. Yang Renhui committed a foul, and Xuesong made a free throw. Hualian led by three to two. After three to one, the Qunsheng team led all the way, becoming seven to four, ten to six. Hualian called a timeout, but it was still difficult to kill their momentum. The Jinde and Jinzhi brothers of the Qunsheng team scored repeatedly, making it 29 to 18, a difference of eleven points. At the end of the first half, the score was 33 to 23, with the visiting team leading. At the start of the second half, there were no changes in the lineups of both sides. Cai Wenhua sneaked into the basket and scored first. The Hualian team still did not improve, and the score difference was always around ten points. Zhenzhong was fouled out for the fifth time, and Zhang Liangxiong replaced him. The score was 42 to 31. Zhang Liangxiong came on and made a long shot, but Jinde and Wenzhang made quick shots, accumulating points. At 54 to 37, the score difference widened. Jinde scored, making it 63 to 39, forming a situation of disparity. When the bell rang, the score was 66 to 45.

Qunsheng Fouls: Chen Jinzhi 0, 23 Cai Wenzhang 4, 8 Chen Jinde 15, 1 Cai Wenhua 3, 20 Yang Renhui 2, 0 Total 16, 66

Hualian Fouls: Chen Xuesong 2, 6 Li Zhenzhong 5, 0 Zhang Liangxiong 1, 8 Wu Chengzhang 0, 11 Bao Songyuan 2, 6 Kong Guangyi 2, 4 Total 13, 45

Also, according to the Basketball Association, the number of tickets sold was 2,000 downstairs and 1,000 upstairs for pre-sale, and 590,000 for temporary tickets, for a total of 1,259 million yuan. It is also known that the second game between Qunsheng and Hualian is scheduled to be held this Saturday (October 5th).

### Improving Yarn Allocation Methods, Intending to Include Cotton Cloth. The Allocation Price Adopts an Active Approach, Not Following the Black Market. The Textile Management Committee Carefully Drafts the Plan.

[Our Report] The Textile Business Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs held a meeting at 11:00 a.m. yesterday at the office of the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui on Jiangxi Road. Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Vice Minister Pan, Zhang Zi, Liu Wenteng, Wang Zijian, Shu Zhang, Wu Wei Jing, Li Shengbo, Wang Qiyu, Rong Hongyuan, Tang Xinghai, and others attended. During the meeting, Minister Wang and the persons in charge of various private yarn factories exchanged very detailed opinions on suppressing the market price of yarn and cloth and strengthening the distribution mechanism. Finally, it was decided that in order to fully suppress the price of yarn and cloth, the existing joint distribution mechanism of national and private yarn factories would be expanded. In addition to distributing cotton yarn, it would also consider distributing cotton cloth. The distribution price will never follow the rising prices of the black market, and efforts will be made to take the initiative and lead the black market price of yarn and cloth to fall. It is expected that after the expansion of the joint distribution mechanism, its constituent members will inevitably include the textile and dyeing industries, so as to take uniform steps to combat the crazy soaring prices of black market yarn and cloth. The entire plan will be submitted to the Textile Business Management Committee for planning.

Minister Wang returned to Beijing by evening train at 10:00 p.m. last night.

### The Valuation Problem of Twenty-One Factories Has Not Been Completely Resolved

The Ministry of Economic Affairs allocated twenty-one enemy and puppet factories as preferential purchases for industrialists in the rear, but the industrialists in the rear were still not satisfied with the valuation problem. The valuation standard of the Evaluation Committee was calculated based on 40% to 80% of the price of new American goods, but the purchasers believed that this type of industrial machinery and equipment was only 10% to 30% of the price of American goods. Therefore, it was suggested that the Processing Bureau, the China Trust Bureau, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs convene a joint meeting to discuss the valuation problem and unify the work of the various competent authorities. However, the Processing Bureau believed that it was not necessary to do so. Therefore, after many efforts to make contact, the joint meeting failed. Now, after several discussions, the industrialists in the rear have decided on four steps: (1) The industrial circles in the rear will estimate a unit for the factories they handle based on actual statistical materials and submit it to the Processing Bureau after discussion. (2) Since the purpose of these factories is to give preferential treatment to the industrialists in the rear who have made contributions to the war of resistance, two or three factories can be extracted for public auction to see whether the price set by the Processing Bureau can be accepted and what the highest bid price is, and how much difference there is from the evaluation, so as to show the reality of preferential treatment. (3) If necessary, they will go to Nanjing to explain the situation to Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, ask for instructions, and request that the joint meeting be convened again to discuss various matters in the long term. (4) If all the suggestions are not adopted, they can only give up this preferential right.

### The Importers and Exporters Association Improves Water Foot Fees

Since the Social Affairs Bureau ordered the import and export industry to formulate improvement measures for water foot fees, the industry association immediately convened a meeting of members to discuss them. The following points have now been decided: (1) Send a letter to the water foot industry associations of various countries to stipulate the water foot fees for goods transported to China, and send a copy to the association immediately. (2) Each shipping company should directly charge each customer and not subcontract it to small companies for handling, in order to eliminate intermediate exploitation. (3) Negotiate with the stevedoring industry association to determine contact methods in order to reduce theft losses. In addition, it is hoped that the various patrol teams and customs houses on the Huangpu River will quickly plan unified command.

### Tinfoil Inventory Registration: All Existing Stocks Must be Sold Off Within One Month; Overdue Items Will Require Payment of Additional Taxes

The Shanghai Tinfoil Association held its inaugural meeting. According to the chairman's report, the Goods Tax Bureau notified that the tinfoil industry must register its inventory and sell off all previous inventory within one month. Overdue items will require payment of additional taxes. The association has now applied for a postponement of collection and exemption of supplementary taxes. It is difficult to predict the result. However, merchants are not as optimistic about holding goods as they were before and are wary. Therefore, the market price has also slightly decreased.

### Meltons Soar in Price

American meltons have suddenly risen from 22,000 yuan to 37,000 to 8,000 yuan within a week. The main reasons for this are that most of the stocks in the hands of domestic and foreign merchants have been sold out, the real sales of local customers are booming, and the customs mistakenly believes that imported declared goods are surplus materials, delaying certification is also a factor. According to general observations, if customs negotiations are completed by the end of this month or early next month and goods can be shipped, the market price may shrink.

### New Goods Tax to be Levied Starting Tomorrow

The Shanghai Goods Tax Bureau, in accordance with the Ministry of Finance's promulgation of new goods taxes on several types of goods such as tea, wheat flour, wool, and cosmetics, has recently been opposed by the wool spinning and cosmetics industries, which are submitting telegrams to the central government for instructions. It is now learned that the bureau has decided to implement the above-mentioned new taxes starting tomorrow. Before receiving clear orders from the Ministry of Finance, the tax rates levied will also be handled in accordance with regulations.

### Incoming Goods Are Out of Reach. The Rayon Problem is Serious.

Rayon prices rose crazily last week. There are two main reasons for this. Since the Textile Construction Company stopped allocating silk numbers, the inventory in the market has been depleted day by day. Although there are rumors of foreign goods arriving in port, there is no news. Most cargo owners regard it as a rare commodity. This is the first reason. The list price allocated by the Textile Construction Company to various manufacturers has increased by 70% compared with the previous period, and the quantity has been reduced to 15 packages per factory. The amount allocated to general manufacturers is far less than the amount consumed. They have no choice but to search for purchases in the black market. This is the second reason. With these two main reasons, speculators are manipulating and monopolizing the market, resulting in the smooth sailing of the black market, which is unstoppable. At the beginning of the week, 120 Tianqiao Youguang was between 3.2 million and 3.3 million yuan. Later, it rose day by day, and even rose by 700,000 yuan in one day. By the weekend, it reached 5.3 million yuan, a surge of more than 2 million yuan in one week. With such a crazy rise, small silk factories are forced to shut down. If there are no new sources of supply, the silk weaving industry will be greatly hit.

### Paper Industry Faces Many Difficulties: Paper Mills are Hit by Foreign Goods; Trading Firms are Troubled by Excessive Capital Outlay; The Number of Eliminated Trading Firms Accounts for About Half

[Our Report] Our reporter interviewed several paper industry leaders and community organizations yesterday and learned that the industry has not seen any improvement recently. Most paper merchants have a feeling that it is difficult to do business. After the exchange rate adjustment, the paper market was stimulated and invigorated for a while, but in the end, the actual sales in the market were limited and it was difficult to sustain. Furthermore, ordering goods from abroad often requires a prepayment of half the deposit. If the goods can arrive on time and quickly, paper merchants can still make a profit. Otherwise, long-term delays (this is said to be a common occurrence), coupled with high interest burdens, not only make it impossible to make a profit, but even require losses. It is reported that among foreign paper products, transparent paper and glass paper have better profits. Newsprint and Daolin paper have very thin profits. As for the products of this street, such as gray newsprint, the North faction was the main customer in the past. Other goods have sales in various ports. However, the unstable situation and traffic obstruction are the fatal blows to paper merchants in this city.

As far as the Paper Business Association of this city is concerned, it currently has a total of 599 member companies. The Zhongzhi Group accounts for more than 120 companies, and the Machine Paper Group accounts for more than 470 companies. General operations lack sufficient Chen. The operating expenses of each paper company have increased without decreasing. It is reported that in 1943, when the enemy and puppet arrogance was at its peak and the speculation and hoarding trend was prevalent, the association's members even reached 1,002. This has now become a thing of the past. The general paper companies that emerged in response to the times have all been eliminated with the times.

As far as the Paper Industry Association of this city is concerned, it also has 23 members, including Hailong, Hualun, Guangzhong, Qigong, and Minfeng. Among them, the factory sites of five members, including Datong, Minfeng, Liyong, Huasheng, and Hua, are all in other cities. These private paper mills are still suffering from raw material costs, high labor costs, and high interest rates in the current difficult situation of my country's industry. Coupled with the low-price competition of foreign goods, the situation is even more depressed. At present, the operating situation of each factory is intermittent, purely depending on market needs. As far as current products are concerned, Lianshi paper still has a small profit to be made. Other products, such as Mao Bian, Haiyue, poster paper, and gray newsprint, are already feeling strained in terms of profits. The price and quality of newsprint products cannot compete with foreign goods for even a short period of time. There are very few factories that are still manufacturing.

As for the factories taken over by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Tianzhang East and West factories, the Jiangnan One and Two factories, the Sakurai Photosensitive Paper Factory, and the Jinxi Paper Mill have already started operations. It is reported that the Tianzhang Jiangnan factories are in a better situation. They are currently producing large quantities of banknote paper. In addition, the Taiwan Paper Corporation of the Assets Committee is also planning to set up an office in this city to promote the company's various yellow and white cardboard, poster paper, and newsprint. The American China Paper Corporation is also starting its engines, producing a wide variety of colored cardboard.

### Flying Tiger General Plans to Organize a Shipping Company, but the Aviation Committee Has Not Approved It

Chennault, the leader of the Flying Tigers who fought against Japan in China, has recently been actively preparing to establish an air transport company in Shanghai to specialize in transporting relief supplies between China and the United States. The company has submitted an application to the Executive Yuan for approval and is preparing to start flying next month. However, the Aviation Committee and the Ministry of Transport believe that the measures for establishing private airlines in China have not yet been formulated, and no matter whether they are Chinese or foreigners, they are not allowed to establish airlines in China. Therefore, the Aviation Committee and the Ministry of Transport have refused to issue flight permits to the airline organized by Chennault and prohibited it from flying without authorization.

### American Cotton Prices Reach Highest Peak: $0.38 per Pound

[Reuters, New York, 18th] New York cotton futures reached a new peak today, with the October and December contracts reaching $0.38 per pound, the highest peak for the latter since December 1919. Other recent contracts have risen to the highest prices since 1920.

### Business License Tax: Those Who Do Not Declare Today Will be Penalized According to Regulations

The deadline for the declaration and payment of the business license tax for the 35th year in this city was originally the end of August this year due to the adjustment of capital. Subsequently, because the deadline had passed, many people had not declared. In order to show compassion for the difficulties of merchants, the Finance Bureau extended the deadline for another month from September 1st to the end of the month. All licensed businesses that have not yet adjusted their declarations and payments can uniformly declare to the License Tax Section of the bureau today, the last day, with their old licenses. Those who are overdue will be penalized according to regulations.

### Ford, the Automobile King: How He Manages Workers

â Guo Hong

We have long been familiar with the career of automobile magnate Mr. Ford. We have also heard of the lives of Ford's workers, and we have a certain admirable envy for them. However, these are just vague rumors. A student studying in the United States, Mr. Luo Naishi, has written a record of his internship at the Ford factory, detailing the factory's labor policies and the lives of its workers. I will now excerpt and translate Mr. Luo's original text below for the reference of domestic manufacturers:

The Ford Motor Company in the United States is a very large organization. It has 100,000 workers and produces an average of 3,000 cars per day. Among the workers, there are all kinds of people: those with no skills, those with highly developed skills, native-born Americans, Canadians, Europeans, South Americans, West Asians, and Chinese (students). The situation is very complex, and all manufacturing business matters related to automobiles have classified work.

The Genius of Organization

The special feature of the Ford Company is its labor policy and the resulting lives of its workers. With the organizational genius of Mr. Ford, he has not only achieved success in the production of goods, but also established a model for dealing with labor and capital.

The Ford Company provides work for disabled workers, such as those who are blind or lame. Because there are many types of work, it is not difficult to find something for people with slight disabilities to do. However, these disabled people are often limited to those who have previously served the company and have unfortunately become ill.

The foremen in the Ford factory do not have the power to dismiss workers. When there are disputes between workers or between workers and supervisors, the foreman is ordered to suspend the worker for about ten days. Beyond this limit, the Employment Affairs Department must make a decision. If the foreman is found to be at fault and the worker is not guilty, the worker will remain in the factory but be transferred to another department to work.

Workers in the Ford factory can freely transfer to other departments for medical needs or because their talents are not suitable. Therefore, some workers are promoted to clerks. Thus, once a worker is hired, they will not be dismissed for failing to do their job. Because of transfers between departments, there is always suitable work to be done.

Every worker in a Ford factory initially earns five dollars a day for the first two months, and six dollars a day in the third month. The rate of wage increase is in increments of forty cents, and it becomes very difficult to increase it further once it reaches seven dollars and twenty cents. Wage increases depend on the nature and efficiency of the work, and the relationship with the foreman.

Regarding the training and education of workers, there are two organizations. One is the Ford Industrial Training School located in Highland Park, and the other is the school department attached to the Ford factory. The Industrial Training School accepts children around the age of twelve, who study for one week and work in the factory for two weeks. The purpose is to train them to become skilled machinists. All expenses are provided by the factory. The products of their work during the internship are actually used. The school department of the Ford factory has three schools: one teaching electrical engineering, one teaching machine repair and toolmaking, and one specializing in the training of supervisors in Ford companies in various locations. The first two schools are open to all workers in the Ford factory during their spare time. There are also exams and certificates are issued. Graduates of the school receive salary increases. However, despite this path for advanced education, the majority of Ford factory workers are still so-called unskilled workers. Because the division of labor is so precise, the procedures for workers are made very simple, and they only need to do it mechanically, without learning.

The Ford factory has a merchandise purchasing committee, which has four business departments: one for fruits and vegetables, one for meat, one for medicine, and one for clothing and miscellaneous goods. It is specifically for workers to purchase, and the selling price is 10% to 15% lower than the normal price. The Highland Park factory alone has daily transactions of $30,000.

Regarding the lives of workers in the Ford factory, when speaking of the time spent in the factory, they work eight hours a day. However, considering arriving early, leaving late, and the time spent traveling to and from the factory, each worker ultimately "needs nine and a half to ten hours of time. Workers' lunches are delivered by a meal service, with a small box of food for each person, and the price and nature are determined by the factory. Each box contains three meat sandwiches, a piece of dessert, a square biscuit, and an apple, banana, or orange. When the meal bell rings, workers rush to the food delivery truck. After getting the box, they find a convenient place to eat. Workers who live near the factory bring their own food to the factory and eat at the appointed time. The content of self-prepared food is naturally much better than that of the meal service.

Tense Work

The Ford factory operates day and night, with eight-hour shifts, requiring three shifts a day. Workers either work the night shift or the day shift, alternating every two weeks or one month. The three shifts are from 7 or 8 AM to 3 or 4 PM, from 3 or 4 PM to 11 or 12 PM, and from 12 PM to 7 or 8 AM. If these three shifts are rotated every two weeks, each worker will rotate through all three shifts in 42 days. This time rotation method is very detrimental to the order of workers' lives. However, the factory has no way to remedy it for the sake of fully utilizing the parts.

What do Ford workers think of the work they do and the attitude of the managers? This is a question that should be asked. There is only one answer to this question: people have the same heart, and factory workers will never voluntarily be loyal to their work. The work in the Ford factory is also divided into routine work and miscellaneous work. Routine work has fixed machines, fixed materials, and fixed expected products. Workers do it according to routine, and you cannot slack off, and it is easy to be detected if you slack off. Miscellaneous work is not the routine of doing a certain thing, moving, sweeping, and changing things at any time. Therefore, there is no certain sense of responsibility for the work, and they only want to slack off and are never willing to work hard.

Workers' Welfare

The welfare program for workers at the Ford factory is also quite well-known. The factory has established a special Investigation Department for the welfare program, which has more than 100 staff members. The Ford factory has set a minimum wage of $5 per day, which has a certain meaning. That is, it includes the workers' share of profits. The sharing of this profit is conditional on improving the workers' living conditions. The job of the Investigation Department is to investigate the workers' lives and report on them to be used as a basis. However, this department has been significantly reduced.

The family lives of Ford workers vary greatly, from crude to beautified, in various forms. Most workers live a relatively high standard of living. Generally speaking, he is about 35 years old, has two or three children, and his wife is always a little younger than him. She is diligent and frugal at home and may be able to save some money. Whether his home is owned or rented, it is always spacious and often has spare rooms for rent. The equipment and appliances in the home are mostly complete. There are also some books to decorate, as well as a piano or radio, and facilities for telephone, water, electricity, and gas. Needless to say, he also has a car produced by the Ford factory. The three meals a day are still decent. When he is dressed neatly, he is no less than an ordinary businessman.

Ford workers certainly do not read books. Few of them have ever reached the eighth grade of elementary school, so they do not like to read, do not like to listen to lectures, do not like art, and do not like music. But he reads the daily newspaper every day. Although he does not read much, his appearance is quite good. He has practical knowledge, he knows mechanical processing, he understands blueprints, he knows how to handle automobiles, and he also has some natural knowledge and hygiene knowledge. As for entertainment events, in addition to driving around on holidays, or going to the suburbs for swimming, fishing, and hunting, or playing ball games, or playing billiards, or watching plays, or going to the park, or going to the dance hall; those with a more depraved inclination will inevitably have gambling behavior.

### Ten Commandments for Supervisors

â Hua

A supervisor must take care of all aspects to make his career successful. Here are ten rules that must be followed:

(1) Set a good example, don't just use rules.

(2) Be kind and fair to your subordinates, then the lower levels will respect you.

(3) Do not use tricks or politics, openness and honesty are the best policy.

(4) Establish good relationships with all parties, and all words and deeds must come from the heart.

(5) Correct mistakes by using suggestions and examples, not just criticism.

(6) Do not answer easily. Think carefully before answering, and implement it thoroughly after answering.

(7) Do not be discouraged and stop doing things because others criticize you. Everything can be said from both sides.

(8) Do not be stubborn, because you are dealing with human beings, not institutions.

(9) Instead of ordering subordinates to take responsibility, it is better to guide subordinates to work together.

(10) All actions and words must be accurate and precise, so that people can easily understand and implement them.

### Production News: Radio that Replaces Clocks and Watches

â Yizhi

Someone in the United States is designing a small radio that specializes in receiving broadcasts from the time signal station attached to the National Bureau of Standards. No matter day or night, you only need to turn on the switch to hear the most accurate time.

This radio is less than half the size of a cigarette case and can be carried around or placed in a handbag.

This timekeeping service will be first launched in New York City, with a shortwave station set up on the top floor of the tallest building, broadcasting the time of the Washington Bureau of Standards all day long. The accuracy can reach only one ten-millionth of a second. The broadcast can sometimes insert simple weather reports or the latest news summaries, lasting no more than ten seconds. The designer believes that this is easy to do and does not require a large amount of capital. In the future, the selling price of that pocket radio will not be more expensive than a good watch.

Panicillin in Short Supply

Since the war, the use of penicillin has increased day by day, and the production volume has also increased accordingly. Now the needs of all parties have increased to 80 million units per month, which is 10 million units more than the current total output of all experimental factories in the United States.

In order to avoid shortages, the US government has restarted purchase restrictions. Therefore, botanists at the University of Wisconsin are stepping up experiments to find ways to rapidly increase production. They have discovered that using ultraviolet light can greatly increase production.

Recently, the US Department of Agriculture is using penicillin to treat animal diseases. If the results are good, the demand for penicillin will inevitably increase significantly. Perhaps the method invented by the University of Wisconsin can solve the difficulty.

### Chinese Export Commodities Exhibition

â Deng Shaoqiu

Mr. Zhang Yifan, the publicity director of the Chinese Export Commodities Exhibition, once said with great experience, "The economic crisis is now extremely serious, so we should promote exports. Although this is not the right time, we must look at the long term. We may as well exhibit it and express it with statistics, so that everyone has a deep impression and that those who care about the export business have concrete materials and facts to study and improve."

Mr. Zhong Ketuo, who was sitting in the same room, felt the same way about the fact that the market was flooded with American goods, which not only affected the business of several companies and firms, but also directly destroyed the development of domestic goods. Therefore, under the proposal of Mr. Yifan, the Chinese Export Commodities Exhibition was established with the hope of Mr. Xiang, Mr. Qin Xiangzhou, and Mr. Li Dingmo, who inadvertently decided to try six companies this time. Of course, they also worked hard on publicity for several months, planned the venue arrangements, maintained close contact with the industry, and held several special seminars in turn. They also received enthusiastic assistance from the American Embassy and the China-America Business Association. TomorrowâOctober 1st, this export exhibition, which should occupy a page in the history of Chinese exports, will be unveiled in front of a large audience.

The exhibition venue is at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA. The position of the exhibits is one unit per hundred square feet. There are 53 units in the entire venue. The distribution of each room is as follows: Room 303 has three units, displaying lacquer, pottery, enamel, and bone ware. Room 320 has four units, specializing in displaying tung oil. The assembly hall has seven units, displaying hardware, toothbrushes, leather, fur, oil, and egg products. Xuegengtang has eight unitsâdisplaying lace embroidery, knitted cotton fabrics, carpets, handkerchiefs, and underwear. The library has five unitsâdisplaying wine, tea, raw silk. The gym has twenty-six units, including straw hats, glass, thermos bottles, local specialties, light bulbs, and building materials.

The participating manufacturers of the exhibits include more than 50 companies such as Xinguang Underwear Weaving Factory, Huade Light Bulb Factory, and Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory. The exhibition period is six days.

It is said that the association also plans to distribute a special publication to all visitorsâ"Letter to the National Industry" and "Reducing the Cost of Domestic Goods," which is old news, but still correct.

The Minister of Economic Affairs said that to save the import surplus crisis, the first is for people to save money, the second is to reduce the cost of domestic goods, and the third is to improve the quality of domestic goods. Regarding the first point, people are now poor and have reduced purchasing power. Most people save as much as they can, and there is nothing they can save. The second and third points are related. The cost can be reduced in order to improve the quality. Now our cost cannot be reduced because the tax rate is too high. Therefore, our unanimous request today is to exempt commodity tax in order to protect this budding domestic industry and commerce, reduce costs, and prevent foreign companies from destroying it.

### New Portable Television

### Silk and Nylon

â Ren Hengliang

Recently, American nylon stockings have flooded the market. In terms of quality, they are indeed slightly better than domestically produced hosiery, but in terms of price, nylon stockings cost more than 30,000 yuan a pair, while domestic silk stockings cost only 10,000 yuan a pair. Therefore, if we compare the size of the price with the quality, it is still cost-effective to wear domestic silk stockings. However, recently, the mentality of Chinese people taking pride in using foreign goods has become a trend, which is actually an extremely erroneous concept. The beauty of American goods is an undeniable fact, but to what extent is it good? Of course, there is a limit. Now, let's compare the quality of nylon and natural silk. (Table based on Chemical World, Volume 1, Issue 3)

As mentioned above, compared with natural silk stockings, the difference between nylon stockings is at most 50%. That is, one and a half pairs of silk stockings can be worth one pair of nylon stockings, but in terms of price, nylon stockings are three times more expensive than silk stockings. Moreover, according to those who have worn nylon stockings, they do not absorb moisture in summer, which may cause skin diseases, and they do not keep warm in winter, and they feel cold on the feet. Silk stockings do not have these drawbacks, and they are equally beautiful in appearance.

Chunqiu (Spring and Autumn)

### New Myth

â Shi Zhecun

My old friend, Pan Cironi, is a small civil servant in the city of Rome. He doesn't want to make a name for himself, but he keeps complaining about his position. Therefore, one day I said to him, "Why don't you think of a way to improve your situation? Climbing up and getting a higher position will make it easier to deal with this life." After hearing my words, he said, "What, ask me to climb a ladder piled up with this bunch of guys?" I said, "Change it. I have never heard of this before. There is no revolution from above, unless you mean the collective suicide of all senior officials, diplomats, and politicians. Do you really believe that when you have become accustomed to this kind of life, this kind of corruption, and especially this kind of inhuman servility, you can still change something that has already changed your entire humanity? Have you ever heard of a person being swallowed by his own feces?"

There is one thing he approves of Mussolini and even Hitler, that is, "We need a new myth," he said. "I have already got this myth. For example, take the country as an example. A country is like a beast. Its posture is like a dog playing. The chin rests on the floor, clamped between the two front paws. The latter half of the body is propped up on its two hind legs. Generations of young people are like worms crawling on the floor towards the dog's mouth to be swallowed by it. The dog honestly and unceremoniously uses its big tongue to eat these worms, then chews them up, and then swallows them. Yes, my myth starts from this, because it swallows these worms up, not down. After these worms are swallowed up, their status in this political or bureaucratic belly becomes higher and higher. Every small civil servant hopes that he will be digested faster than others. He hopes to get out as smoothly as possible until he finally "comes out". I don't need to describe what happened later. You know, after they drill out, people call them "master". Dear friends, you all hope to be promoted to prominence quickly, but I would rather be left in the dark dog's belly forever undigested."

Note: "This is a translation. I can't write it myself. The original work was written by an Italian writer living in America, Nicola Tucci, and published in the Comrade Review, Winter 1946."

### The Reproduction of Huang Zi's Works

â Liang Youyan

Among Chinese composers, the most popular is Mr. Huang Zi. His "Family Happiness Song" is as appreciated by people as Zhao Yuanren's "How Can I Not Think of Him," and it has remained unchanged for a long time; this shows that good art has permanent value.

Compared with Xian Xinghai, who died in Moscow last year, or He Luting, who is still alive, Mr. Huang Zi has fewer works in terms of quantity; but Huang Zi's secret of success lies in: only seeking fine products, not seeking high output; this is the same as the success of playwright Cao Yu.

Among Huang Zi's works, ranging from the instrumental overture "Nostalgic Melody"âwith which he won the top graduation award at the Yale University School of Music in the United States, creating his position abroadâto the small song "Flowers Are Not Flowers" (words by Bai Juyi), and the well-known "Family Happiness" song, "Blue Sky, White Sun, Crimson Ground" (chorus, it is said that this song was originally prepared to be the national anthem of our country, but it was not selected; in fact, many people think that the melody and mood of this song are more magnificent than today's national anthem.) "The Flag Is Flying," "Hot Blood," "National Flag Song,"... it can be said that none of them are not full of strong emotions and endless taste, even people who are not very Musicai will feel "easy to understand and never tire of listening to" when they hear Huang Zi's songs. But one thing worth noting is that good songs are not necessarily understood by most people, and music that pleases the public is not necessarily good. However, Huang Zi's things show both aspects: they can be accepted by people from many aspects, and they do not hinder their own unique style; his works are neither profound nor vulgar, and sometimes, his melody is also full of both flavors, such as the beginning of "The Flag Is Flying"; but at the same time, he is also good at giving play to the wonderful aspects of Eastern sentiments, such as the first sentence of "Family Happiness" (using the Chinese pentatonic scale to conduct its melody). The study of his success should be attributed to his good use of the wonderful aspects of Eastern and Western sentiments, and at the same time, he is good at reconciling these two extreme components. This is the origin of Huang Zi's style, and this is the method he used to create his own unique style.

Among Chinese musicians, in terms of national music, I admire the late Mr. Liu Tianhua, and in terms of Western music, I like Huang Zi's works very much. Unfortunately, both of them are short-lived artists. Huang Zi died at the age of only thirty-four. He was one year younger than the short-lived musician Mozart (who lived to be thirty-five years old). He saw the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, but he did not see the victory of the war (he died in April 1938). However, he had already done his best for the national struggle. He wrote "Song of Resistance Against the Enemy" and "The Flag Is Flying," which are both outstanding among the songs of the War of Resistance.

I didn't lie, and I didn't deliberately emphasize it. I really love Huang Zi's works. Therefore, I rushed to listen to the last day of the "Huang Zi Works Concert" organized by the Shanghai Music Society this time.

Cantata "Song of Everlasting Regret": "...I only hate that love in the world is always difficult to fall in love with. Now I am specially favored and honored. I am afraid that the beauty will grow old, but it is like a cold autumn fan....

In the mortal world, there are many infatuated people, and the joys and sorrows of separation and reunion are in vain to make lovesickness dreams. I can't understand that the flowers in the mirror and the moon in the water will eventually become empty."

This program was performed with mixed chorus or duet and symphony orchestra accompaniment, conducted by Mr. Huang Yongxi. The organization of the chorus is still very sound; originally, the organization of vocal music is more difficult than the organization of instrumental music, and the preparation and training of talents in a choir are often thankless. In this choir, most of them are professional youths from all walks of life. They have the determination to devote themselves to music, but for the sake of life, they can only regard music as a side job. It is because of this that the organization and training of a choir are really not easy. The choir participating in the performance of the Shanghai Music Society this time is still considered to be doing its duty in both the female and male sections. Mr. Huang's conducting is also very crisp and powerful, and many small details are especially clear, and there are not too many tricks, and it seems that it can also produce the side effect of "the conductor gives beauty".

The lady who participated in the duet in the second section of "Song of Everlasting Regret", "The Seventh Day of the Seventh Month in the Hall of Eternal Life", had a weak voice, so in the accompaniment of the orchestra, her voice was simply very weak, and the emotions could not be expressed. Miss Gao Zhilan's singing of her "Three Wishes for Roses" was even more brilliant, and she was asked to "do it again." In the second repeat, her pronunciation was purer, because in the first time, her voice seemed to have a feeling of "rustling" when the melody went high, but it was gone in the second time.

The concert ended in the four-part mixed chorus of "The Flag Is Flying". This program was unusually exciting, and the audience also asked for another one. Therefore, this performance was considered a complete success. In Shanghai, there is a lack of great vocal music. Recalling that Japan had performed Beethoven's choral symphony (Ninth Symphony) many years ago, it makes people feel that Shanghai urgently needs to establish a vocal music organization! Here, I wish the Shanghai Music Society more powerful! At the same time, I am more grateful to Mr. Huang Zi for giving us a rich legacy!

### In the Village

â Ye Feng

Cooking Smoke

Arriving hereâthis village desolate for three yearsâI see wisps of cooking smoke rising again from the low thatched huts. This earth, cleansed by disaster, is beginning to revive.

The silent, ancient waterwheel is singing by the river again. A wave of sowing laughter rises from the green fields, and clear mountain songs echo in the blue sky. Birds soar freely in the air, and the fragrance of wildflowers fills the air... Our village is growing up in the spring.

Our hardworking farmers no longer sit by the river weeping.

Today, they possess this vast land, many livestock, and farming tools... Their days are truly joyful! Their lives are truly peaceful! The light of their lives is shining brightly!

And so, wisp after wisp of cooking smoke rises again in the village, lingering in the evening sky.

Cattle Pen

In that dim and damp cattle pen, the calves are lowing softly, chewing on the tender green grass, laden with dew, that the farm women have just cut from the fields. A little girl stands outside the cattle pen, gazing intently. What does her little heart hope to unearth from that deep cattle pen?

Cobwebs hang thickly on the roof beams, an old lantern hangs under the eaves, and a wave of putrid air blows out from the cattle pen in the evening breeze.

In past years, in the days when disaster struck, farmers lost their livestock and their farmland, gasping daily on the brink of starvation and death. The cattle pen quietly dreamt nightmares of the night during the day.

Now, the cattle pen has awakened from a long night of nightmares. Many calves crowd together, lowing, and the humble thatched huts overflow with the cheers of life.

Country Path

Today, I walk on the country path paved with pebbles of quartz, and my heart feels very happy. I see that our working people have started working in the fields again.

They walk busily, one by one, humming mountain songs, carrying their respective farming tools, seeds, and fertilizer...

When the harvest season arrives, how busy they will be! Even the children must work! With work, their lives seem solid...

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of Blood 48

â Ye Jinfeng

However, at that time, good news kept coming, again and again, and again. To say that I felt no excitement or joy at all would be an insincere lie. It was because of this excitement that I rushed to Dingyuanâs place with these good news, telling their family one by one. Just as I finished speaking, the station's employee also rushed in, reporting, "Our troops in Wanping have driven away all the Japanese troops nearby and are now in pursuit."

"What a pity!" Dingyuan was leaning against the pillows on the bed. Hearing these triumphant news, he suddenly slapped the edge of the bed and sat up straight. For a moment, he was unable to...

I was just about to hear what he meant by "What a pity" and how he was "unable for a moment," when I saw him staring blankly at his own legs under the thin sheet.

"What do you mean?" He didn't say anything, so I had to ask. His wife and Meijun were both present and were also stunned, not knowing what he was thinking.

"I really want to..." He paused. "I really want to take a trip to Beiping at this time, but I'm afraid these legs...won't be able to..."

"Brother, why are you in such a hurry?" Meijun interjected.

"Really, listen, the fighting is very fierce. Even if there is a car and you have the energy, I'm afraid of stray bullets..." Mrs. Wu also advised.

Before Meijun could let her mother finish speaking, she interjected, "According to what Uncle Yue said just now, our troops are fighting so well. Why not wait another half a day and let them fight further. You'll feel better, and going to Beiping will be easy, won't it?"

"Child," Dingyuan looked at Meijun solemnly, "I understand what you mean. You're afraid that my body can't handle it, and you're afraid that the road will be difficult and dangerous. You must know that although our family is not like ordinary people, with slogans like "Dedicate oneself to the country," we must know that "military affairs are like fire." Perhaps at this time, we are short of someone who understands telecommunications, and we are short of nurses like you. Besides, as for the danger, I'm not looking for bad luck early in the morning. In the future, in the army, can you say that if there is danger, you won't go forward? Don't you see our troops charging into the cannons?..."

"I plan," he looked at me again, "I plan to trouble you, "seeing the Buddha all the way to the West," to find a way to get a car. If it's a big car, we'll all go. If the car is small, I'll take Shiren, and we'll go, father and son. He's old enough to support me a little. What do you think, old brother?..."

I hesitated for a moment and looked at Meijun and Mrs. Wu. They were staring at me, probably wanting me to say a few words of dissuasion. I felt that they had two different opinions now, and both sides had their own reasons: one side was arguing for "seizing the opportunity," and the other side was arguing for safety.

"I think," I spoke to all three giants of their family, "Brother, sister-in-law, great-niece, we're not outsiders, so I'll say what's on my mind. Brother's opinion is not wrong; sister-in-law and great-niece's words also have sufficient reason. There are plenty of cars, as long as I make a phone call to Beiping, small cars, big cars, even two or three, I can get them. I can't guarantee the safety issue because the war situation changes rapidly. However, for the sake of brother's matter, I can accompany you there and accompany you back, even if we take a detour. We can detour west to the Fire Ash Factory; if not, we can detour west to Jietai Temple or Mentougou, which is only half an hour more. If we're fast, we can finish the work and get home for lunch; if we're a little slower, we can get home before dinner... However, to sum it all up, to sum it all up, it must be the unanimous opinion of your whole family... What do you all think?..." I was not acting like an old fox who was unwilling to take responsibility for others. You think, in such turbulent times of war, who dares to take such responsibility for anyone?

### Offering School to Celebrate Birthday

â Shao Fu

President Chiang's sixtieth birthday this year, someone proposed, dedicate schools to celebrate his birthday, embodying the cultivation of talents in the commemoration of the supreme leader's great achievements. This move is quite meaningful. I remember two years before the War of Resistance, during the year of President's Chiang's fiftieth birthday, there was a nationwide movement to donate aircraft to celebrate his birthday. The effects of that movement had substantial benefits for the subsequent War of Resistance. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, national reconstruction is the urgent task. And the most important work of national reconstruction is to popularize education and cultivate talents. The school donation movement can be said to be in line with the spirit of the times.

Civilization swept the floor. After eight years of war in the occupied territories, not only education has gone bankrupt, but morality has been destroyed. We are heartbroken by the various illegal and undisciplined phenomena in society today. If we do not strive to remedy this in our generation and no longer think about the next generation, the future of our nation is truly unthinkable!

Schools are lacking, and this situation is even worse in the smaller counties and more remote areas of various provinces. Students cannot afford tuition. All of this naturally creates problems for the knowledge of the next generation.

Commemorating the President's birthday in this way is probably what the President would most gladly agree to, because it simultaneously alleviates the current suffering of students who are out of school. I hope everyone can respond quickly and work together to achieve this.

Mental Hygiene

### How to Control Emotions

â Gui Ting

Just Like Driving a Horse

Emotional impulses can make a person's heart beat faster, increase blood pressure, and even lead to muscle spasms. Excessive disgust can cause a person to feel nauseous and vomit, and excessive panic can cause a person to faint on the spot.

According to Dr. G. Colket Caone M.D., a professor of neurology at Harvard University, it is not other people's words and actions that make us feel unhappy or tired. The main reason lies in our own emotional reactions. If we were completely indifferent, neither angry nor jealous, then no one could disturb our emotions.

Frankly speaking, emotional impulses are not a bad thing. In many ways, they can help the body prepare for various actions, such as promoting blood circulation in the muscles and adding more sugar to the blood to provide special strength.

Excitement and Impulses

A person cannot give a brilliant speech if his emotions do not become aroused. Similarly, an athlete cannot win a championship in a race if he feels no excitement at all.

However, emotional impulses are only beneficial to us when they stimulate us to consider in advance how to deal with future environments or encourage us to actively fight with the environment. However, most of the reasons that disturb our emotions lie in various threatening factors; for example, losing our loved ones, the pressure of family environment, the impact of health, worries about unemployment, and economic difficulties. If we doubt our ability to cope, new environments are enough to create a terrible threat to us.

Train Yourself

Therefore, we must train ourselves how to actively consider, plan, and cope with new environments when threatened. We must adopt a positive attitude towards various threatening factors. This is the most reasonable attitude everyone should hold. This attitude is "No matter what happens, we must deal with it calmly." This is completely the opposite of the attitude of "We hope that such things will not happen." Doing so, we will naturally be calm and will never worry unnecessarily. Even if something unexpected happens, we will already be fully prepared to deal with it.

On the other hand, if we hold the attitude of "We hope that such things will not happen," then we will always feel uneasy. Even if we have been safe for a long time, we will still feel unstable. Because the possibility of expected things happening always exists. Such an attitude thus leads to anxiety, fatigue, and other physiological symptoms such as heart palpitations or indigestion.

Emotional control is like controlling a horse. We must learn how to drive it, keep it in check at all times, and train it to be able to move forward bravely and continue to advance in any situation. Only in this way can we control our emotions and make them exert unparalleled power.

Muscle Tension

Emotional illnesses are mostly caused by muscle tension. Therefore, relaxing the muscles and allowing them to enjoy full rest will have an infinitely calming effect on the mind. Relaxing our muscles will make us feel: "Everything is in order." Therefore, we must develop the ability and habit to rest anytime and anywhere. Let us put aside all public and private affairs every day, rest quietly for a few minutes, and rest several times more. The ideal times to rest are before getting up in the morning and before going to bed at night.

Complete Rest

When a person goes to bed, he should relax all the muscles of his body and let the brain enjoy complete rest. He should absolutely not use his brain or worry about things. He should clear his mind to a vacuum, let it rest and recuperate. As for whether to sleep during the day or not, it is not necessarily necessary. What is needed is rest, real rest, and full rest. We must learn how to rest in order to control our emotions and increase our physical and mental well-being (the content of this article is taken from Dr. Canal's famous book "How to Deal with the Environment").

### Odds and Ends

â Mo Gao

After the tragedy in Yugoslavia, an American reporter talked about how to beat a dog: hit it with a stick so that it cannot turn over. He said, "Good people give way one step, bad dogs take two steps forward, good people kick back, and the bad dogs have to run away."

This is not only a warning to the United States at the moment, but also a sharp stick pointed at the national conditions of our country.

On Labor Day in the United States, the New York Daily News, which sells 4.6 million copies a day, had an editorial commemorating Labor Day and Victory Day. In the final conclusion, it said, "If we now tell another country the secrets of making atomic bombs, then we are no different from being naked."

### Second Nature

â Mo

Before developing a new habit, you should be determined to test whether you can govern yourself.

Once you have embarked on a new path, there should be no more exceptions, just like throwing a wound ball of thread to the ground. One wrong step can often completely destroy previous efforts.

Put your good intentions into practice at any time; but if your good habits have already produced considerable results, you should not be complacent, let alone be satisfied.

The benefit of habit is that it enables us to be consistent. Habit is the axis of good social progress. In a good society, everyone first develops good habits. If you are unhappy, it can lead us through this troublesome time, assist us in doing those trivial and annoying chores, and encourage us to do important work. It can also save us mental energy and increase precise procedures.

The more good habits, the easier life is, and the more the power to resist temptation increases.

"Although habit is not equal to nature, habit is second nature."

### Merchant's Heart

â Wen Yi

Recalling the year after Shanghai fell to the Japanese invaders, I happened to talk about national affairs with a rice merchant, and he said:

"...: However, if China were to fall to Japan, it would not be a big harm to us rice merchants; because the Japanese also eat rice. If China were to fall to a country that eats bread, then we rice merchants would have no way to survive!" Sun Liren on the India-Burma Front

Before the victory, Stilwell and Sun Liren discussed the counter-offensive on the India-Burma front.

### Famous General Sun Liren

â You Fu

In China, there are only a few graduates of the American West Point Military Academy, and among these few, General Sun Liren is the one who has established extraordinary achievements on the battlefield and is famous at home and abroad.

A Good Story in the Army

Before the victory, no one in the Chinese and American officers and soldiers on the India-Burma battlefield did not know the name of Sun Liren, and everyone had a very deep impression engraved in their hearts. General Stilwell once said to General Zheng Dongguo, the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Expeditionary Force in India: "Chinese generals are also very good!" However, the one who is most unforgettable is Sun Liren, the commander of the New First Army.

I remember in February of the thirty-third year [1944], General Sun commanded the Mengguan Campaign in the Hukawng Valley, and the attack was unsuccessful, and the battle was extremely fierce. At that time, he vowed to grow a full beard and resolutely told his comrades: "I will not shave my beard until I enter Mengguan"âlater, Mengguan was finally captured on March 9. General Sun also shaved off every single hair of his beard. Since then, this interesting story of his has been passed down on the India-Burma battlefield and became a popular tale.

He was originally a graduate of Tsinghua University, and later studied in the United States; because he became interested in military affairs, he entered the West Point Military Academy to study. Therefore, American officers all knew that he was a graduate of a Chinese university and looked up to him. He spoke very fluent English and often had long conversations with American officers. Also because of this, he became very familiar with figures in the American military.

The True Color of a Soldier

In peacetime, you see his gentle and elegant attitude, and you think he is a scholar; on the battlefield, you see his brave and good fighting spirit and his perseverance, and you cannot help but admit that he is a brave general. Once he arrives on the battlefield, he fully displays his true soldierly nature. As long as he is determined to attack a certain place, no matter how difficult it is, he will definitely take it down. If his subordinates are slightly negligent in military orders, he will immediately punish them. This kind of attitude of his not only prevents his subordinates from acting recklessly, but even the American officers and soldiers are equally afraid of him. All the American officers and soldiers under his command are very careful.

It is said that an American messenger delivered an official document to him, because he did not understand Chinese military etiquette. Following American practices, he entered his office. He suddenly flew into a rage and insisted that the American soldier follow the regulations of military etiquette. The American soldier was so anxious that he had a big headache. He had to shout "Report" in English at the door first, and then, after he answered "Come in" inside, the American messenger dared to enter. He continued to give a fifteen-degree bow according to the rules, and handed the official document to him with both hands. After signing it, the American soldier retrieved the receipt book and, as usual, bowed another fifteen degrees before stepping out of his office. Since then, American officers and soldiers have paid special attention to Chinese etiquette, especially in front of Sun Liren, and dare not be casual.

Going to Europe for Observation

He led his troops strictly, repeatedly made extraordinary achievements, and was deeply appreciated by Chairman Chiang and valued by General Eisenhower; so after the counter-offensive in India and Burma was won, Germany surrendered, and the European war ended, General Eisenhower specially sent a special plane to take General Sun to Paris to inspect the European battlefield and the fortifications and positions of the German army. He did not return to Japan until May of this year, when he finally returned to China.

Recently, he has been honorably appointed as the Commander of the Fourth Pacification District and concurrently as the Commander of the Changchun Garrison. After the Battle of Sipingjie, the communist army in the Northeast cannot but admire this brave general who fought in India.
