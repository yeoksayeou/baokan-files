### National Army Vanguard Enters Chifeng; Du Yuming Flies to Rehe for Inspection; Jidong Recovers Xianghe and Sanhe Counties

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 5th] Commander Du Yuming flew to Rehe on the morning of the 5th for inspection.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 5th] Military authorities confirmed today that the National Army entered Chifeng yesterday, but as of this morning, street fighting is still ongoing. The National Army in Chengde is clearing the surrounding areas, and the National Army advancing south from Chengde has approached Gubeikou. At the same time, the National Army advancing north from Miyun is engaged in fierce fighting with the Communist army near Gubeikou. It is said that the National Army may join forces at Gubeikou tonight or tomorrow. More than 2,000 reinforcements arrived from the northwest this morning. The recovery of the Pinggu Line has begun from Miyun and is progressing northward.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 5th] According to a military official, the distance between Chengde Gubeikou and the bandits is long, with towering mountains, and the Communist army has a considerable number between Chengde and Gubeikou, so the progress of the National Army advancing south from Chengde has not been too rapid. The encirclement battle in eastern Hebei has already begun. The National Army along the Great Wall line is stationed in the Yiyuankou coastal area and is engaged in fierce fighting near Leting. Sanhe, Xianghe, and Midi, along the Bei Canal, are also in fierce fighting.

### Communist Army Ceaselessly Attacks Datong; National Army Will Attack Zhangjiakou

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 5th] After Chen Cheng explained that Zhangjiakou and Rehe are the same battlefield, this reporter visited a certain authority today. It is reported that if the Communist army does not stop its attack on Datong within one or two days, the National Army will recover Zhangjiakou within a week or ten days.

In addition, it is learned that the Pingsui Line and the Pingcheng Line have started operations simultaneously.

There was also an intelligence report stating that Nie Rongzhen, acting on Zhu De's instructions, was besieging Datong, with a deadline of one week from the 1st and a deadline of three days to capture the station, and began attacking the city on the 4th. This shows that the city of Datong was safe and sound until the Hai hour on the 3rd.

### Ambassador Stuart Expresses Views Yesterday, Clarifying the Purpose of Selling Surplus Materials, Aspiring to Help Us Improve People's Lives

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] Ambassador Stuart Leighton said to reporters on the 5th regarding the informal small group meeting: Special Envoy Marshall is only in an assisting position, and he himself is still responsible. Ambassador has not expressed his opinion on the two prerequisites insisted upon by the Communist Party, because he and Special Envoy Marshall are still expecting a turning point and hope that the small group meeting can proceed smoothly.

[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 5th] Ambassador Stuart issued a statement today, sternly refuting the claim that the United States' transfer of surplus materials to China would fuel the civil war. He said: The sale of these materials to China is out of goodwill, intended to benefit the entire China, not favoring one party, and moreover, if these surplus materials are not transferred to China, they will be useless.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] Today's newspaper carried a message that "Ambassador Stuart protested against the Communist Party's accusations that the ambassador discussed the sale of surplus U.S. military materials with Peterson in Shanghai." According to Fu Jingbo, Ambassador Stuart's personal advisor, there was no such thing and it should be corrected. As for the matter itself, the ambassador explained that this trip to Shanghai had nothing to do with the agreement on the transfer of materials and that he did not meet with Peterson. The amount of surplus materials this time is very large and cannot be sent back to the United States, so it is transferred to China, but it is definitely not used for civil war, but to help improve the lives of the Chinese people.

### US Congressman Arrives in Shanghai, Transfers to Philippines, Issues Statement in Beiping Accusing Soviet Attempts, Demanding US Take a Stronger Stance

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 5th] The U.S. House Military Committee Pacific Inspection Group, led by Representative Short, ended its schedule in Beiping and is scheduled to fly to Shanghai at 9:00 AM on the 6th, and then transfer to Manila for inspection.

[Associated Press, Beiping, 5th] Members of the U.S. House Military Committee stated: The United States should take a tougher stance towards the Soviet Union; otherwise, if China fails to solve its domestic problems, the United States may become a scapegoat. Because the United States has taken on the role of mediator between the National Government and the Chinese Communist Party, the large-scale civil war that has broken out in China will inevitably be blamed on the United States. According to Representative Sikes, a Democratic Congressman and spokesperson for the committee, Special Envoy Marshall and the personnel he brought to assist in resolving the China problem are currently undertaking the great task of sacrificing themselves without pleasing anyone, but their efforts are now being hampered by the intransigence of the two parties in China. The failure of negotiations to resolve the Chinese dispute is largely due to Soviet influence, and the Chinese Communist Party, "due to orders from above or the irresponsibility of military leaders," has violated the ceasefire order in North China and the Northeast. The Soviet Union's attempt to control the whole of China is underway, and once successful, we can prepare to withdraw completely from the East. Since the United States is concerned about world peace, it cannot condone such a state of affairs.

### Military Subsistence Allowance Canceled; Physical Objects to be Distributed According to Regulations

### Communist Party Coldly Responds, Stalling the Situation; The Five-Person Meeting is a Distant Prospect; Marshall and Stuart Jointly Meet with Zhou Enlai Yesterday

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The convening of the informal small group meeting is a distant prospect and seems to be aborted. However, Ambassador Stuart and Special Envoy Marshall are still making a final effort. At 10:00 AM on the 5th, Special Envoy Marshall visited Ambassador Stuart for an hour, reportedly to study the crux of the problem of the two prerequisites put forward by the Communist Party. After Special Envoy Marshall returned to his residence, he met with Yu Dawei, who said that he would not express any opinions, as he was not visiting as a representative of the government, but for other matters. He said at the end: The government is still very sincere and tolerant in seeking peace.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] Zhou Enlai visited Special Envoy Marshall at 4:30 PM on the 5th. Ambassador Stuart arrived one hour earlier, and the three immediately held talks until 7:30 PM, when the ambassador left for the embassy and went to another private appointment. Zhou and Marshall talked until 8:00 PM and had dinner together, and Zhou did not return until 9:15 PM. According to a spokesperson for the Chinese Communist delegation, the theme of today's talks was still the two prerequisites, and he said that if there is a guarantee of a ceasefire, the reorganization of the government can also be submitted to the Political Consultative Conference for resolution, but the government has not yet responded, and today's talks have not yielded any results, and the small group meeting will not be able to be mentioned.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] This reporter visited Secretary-General Wu Techeng on the evening of the 5th, who said: We are still waiting for Zhou Enlai, waiting for the meeting to come. The creation of this delay should be the responsibility of the Communist Party. A certain foreigner said: I think there will always be a way, and the stalemate will not last long.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The informal five-person small group meeting has not formally convened as of the evening of the 5th. Government representatives and U.S. Ambassador Stuart are waiting quietly. The prelude to the talks has just begun, and due to the Communist Party's cold attitude towards participating in the talks, it is showing a trend of being shelved. Communist representative Zhou Enlai, after talking with Special Envoy Marshall at length on the evening of the 4th, declared that "the situation is serious and there are no results." The Communist spokesperson also said yesterday that the United States signed a huge amount of sales of surplus U.S. materials with the government at this time, which is enough to help expand the civil war. It is heard that the Chinese Communist Party has protested this matter to Special Envoy Marshall. From the above signs, it can be pointed out that there are still many clouds before the formal start of the talks, but Ambassador Stuart still has great hope for the future of the talks. Special Envoy Marshall visited the ambassador at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 5th for one and a half hours. In the afternoon at 4:30, Marshall and Stuart jointly met with Zhou at Special Envoy Marshall's residence. When the ambassador left at 7:00, Marshall and Zhou were still continuing the talks. Zhou did not leave until 9:00.

### Youth League to Hold Fifth Meeting Today, Inviting the Chairman to Preside in Person to Listen to Opinions on the Nature of the League

[Our Newspaper, Guling, 5th] The Youth League National Congress will hold its fifth meeting on the 6th, which will enter the discussion stage. The central issue is to determine the nature of the League. It is heard that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Chief of Staff Chen Cheng both intend to preside in person to listen to the opinions of the representatives. Observing the atmosphere and general trend of the congress, it is quite possible that the League will become the only independent revolutionary political group for the new youth of the new China.

[Central News Agency, Guling, 5th] The Youth League's Second National Congress held its fourth meeting at 8:30 AM on the morning of the 5th, with a total of more than 700 people attending and participating. The meeting was chaired by He Zhonghan, Wang Zhiyuan, and Xu Suyu from the fourth group of the presidium. The meeting reviewed school league affairs, and speakers were still enthusiastic, all agreeing that the shortcomings of school league affairs lie in funding difficulties, neglect of training, and lack of leadership, while its advantages are that it can regularly provide students with accurate knowledge of domestic and foreign affairs. Ai Sha then gave a supplementary report on frontier league affairs and passed the following resolutions: (1) Former Secretary-General Zhang Zhizhong's autonomous new administration has greatly benefited the youth of the frontier, and the congress should send a telegram to express its condolences.

### Minister Bai, on Behalf of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Inspects the Nanjing Parachute Corps; All Performances Achieve Outstanding Results

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] On the 5th, Minister Bai inspected the Parachute Corps on behalf of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. The location was the Transportation School outside Zhonghua Gate. The grand review ceremony began at 8:00 AM. When this reporter joined the ranks of the review officers and marched to this group of special soldiers to the sound of the bugle, I looked up at the fluttering national flag, reflecting the green mountains, fully expressing the vitality of new life. Minister Bai led the way, and all the review officers followed him under the autumn sun. Minister Bai said to reporters very happily, this is an emerging arm of the military, worthy of promotion, and paratroopers will occupy a very important position in future wars. Bai also inquired about the soldiers' physical lives, always with a smile on his face, giving a feeling of kindness. After the review, we visited various equipment parachutes, equipment bags, equipment barrels, and various application tools, and made detailed adjustments. A demonstration was given for the folding umbrella item. After the indoor visit, there was a dynamic demonstration of the basic training of paratroopers, such as jumping out of the aircraft door, rolling exercises, landing training, umbrella hanging racks, three-dimensional models, and skydiving. Then a realistic battlefield unfolded before you. This item is called battlefield psychological test, using landmine explosions, hand grenades, smoke screens, machine guns, and various weapons with barbed wire. At the beginning, I only saw piles of yellow, green, and black smoke rising from various strongholds, immediately obscuring the soldiers who were crawling forward and about to cross the barbed wire. The beautiful smoke formation thickened and lasted for a long time, and the continuous sounds of machine guns and cannons resounded through the mountains, and bullets flew across the low sky. The reporter, who was watching the battle, temporarily acted as a war correspondent, with a restless soul. There were many more performances to follow. After walking for three hours under the scorching sun, everyone was mentally exhausted when they returned indoors. Bai asked: "Do you think it's easy to be a soldier?" The reporter replied: "I would collapse if I did it for one day." Bai laughed loudly. In fact, the reporter had already been unable to support it. From 1:00 PM onwards, there were also skydiving performances, with even more exciting programs. Three P-17 aircraft spat out 36 strong men. They flew down from the high sky, each with a flower, white, red, yellow, and green, ironed on the infinitely good blue sky. You regarded him as a painting, but when you watched him jump down from the plane, your heartstrings would tense up. They all have healthy bodies and minds, steel physiques, and calm hearts. Thinking about jumping down from a height of 1,000 meters in the air, can you not be anxious? The reporter went to visit these heroes who fell from the sky. Everyone was under the wings of the plane, and the green grass was a bench. They were as lively as children. They said, "Jump" I was a little scared the first time, not scared the second time, scared the third time, and more scared after that. Wu Qifa was the first to jump down, solid, calm, and lively, an excellent strong man. Each time from leaving the aircraft to the ground, it took a total of 25 seconds. There were also Wang Baosheng, Zhu Ding, and Ji Danchu, who were the first to jump down. After the performance, everyone gathered at the Lizhi Society for a meal, which lasted until 5:00 PM. Minister Bai will give a lecture in the morning of the 6th.

### Opening of the General Relief Administration Work Review Meeting; Chairman Chiang Issues Admonitory Remarks; Hopes to Overcome Difficulties and Achieve Practical Results

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] The first General Relief Administration (GRA) post-war relief work review meeting was held at the Academia Sinica at 9:00 AM on the 5th. Present were GRA Director Chiang Ting-fu, Deputy Director Pu Xuefeng, UNRRA China Office Director Major General Aagerton, directors and deputy directors of various branch offices, heads of various offices, heads of storage and transportation bureaus, representatives of various ministries and commissions, and CCP representative Wu Yunfu, totaling about 200 people. After Director Chiang announced the opening, he respectfully read Chairman Chiang's admonitory remarks, the original text of which stated: "Director Chiang and all colleagues attending the work review meeting: I, Chiang Kai-shek, am deeply concerned that I am unable to attend the meeting in Nanjing due to other commitments. The post-war relief work has been underway in various regions for up to a year in some places and at least half a year in others. Although some regions may have faced special circumstances and various transportation difficulties, hindering the full progress of the work, generally speaking, colleagues from the headquarters to the provincial branch offices have all been dedicated with a fiery spirit, rushing to rescue those affected by the disasters. Achievements such as transporting refugees, providing relief for the Hunan disaster, and preventing floods are undeniable. However, our country has endured eight years of war, and the devastation caused by the enemy is extremely widespread, and the damage to our vitality is particularly severe. Therefore, not only should we intensify our passive relief efforts, ensuring that all relief supplies can quickly reach disaster areas and benefit the victims, alleviating the hardships of this winter, but also, regarding projects related to restoring the people's productive capacity, we should strictly implement them according to the established plans, ensuring that disaster victims in all regions have the means to become self-sufficient in the shortest possible time. It is hoped that the colleagues attending the meeting will use their experience and follow these principles to thoroughly discuss and consider all aspects, overcome difficulties, eliminate obstacles, correct past mistakes, and achieve practical results in the future, to meet the expectations of the people of the whole country. I urge you all to work hard." After the remarks, President Song, represented by Fan Fuchang, and UNRRA China Office Director Aagerton delivered speeches in succession. After the speeches, a group photo was taken, and the opening ceremony was completed. Immediately afterwards, the first general meeting was held, where Director Chiang delivered a speech, providing a detailed account of the GRA's past and future work. The meeting adjourned at around 12:00 PM. At 2:30 PM in the afternoon, the second general meeting was held. First, GRA advisor Wu Jingchao reported on his observations from inspecting Guilin and Hunan provinces. Then, the directors or deputy directors of various branch offices each gave a brief ten-minute report, explaining the progress of their work and the difficulties encountered. The director of the Taiwan branch office, Qian Zongqi, who came from afar, attracted the most attention. The conference will hold review meetings on the 6th, and UNRRA China Office Director Major General Aagerton is scheduled to hold a press conference at 10:00 AM on the 6th.

### Chiang Ting-fu Critically Examines the Advantages and Disadvantages, Pointing Out Optimistic, Dissatisfied, and Tricky Points

In his speech this morning, Director Chiang expressed dissatisfaction with China's failure to receive fair relief. Chiang stated: UNRRA's total budget is $3 billion USD, and China's share is worth about $600-700 million USD, which is a significant amount. However, considering the population of the recovered areas, the amount received is only $2 USD per person, which is far less than the average of $40 USD per person received by European countries, and even less than the $10 USD or more per person received by former enemy Italy. Chiang stated that he has always felt uncomfortable about this matter. When reviewing past work, Chiang cited several optimistic facts. First, 5 million people in Hunan and Guilin provinces have survived because they received UNRRA supplies. Second, the repair of the dikes of the Yellow River and the Yangtze River is progressing well. If the situation improves, the project to close the breach in the Yellow River is expected to be completed by the end of the year. Third, 700,000 refugees have been sent back to their homes from the rear, and the work of sending overseas Chinese is also underway. Fourth, agricultural improvements in provinces such as Guangxi have been quite effective. However, in carrying out this type of work, various setbacks have been encountered, mainly due to poor organization and insufficient transportation conditions. What Chiang is most dissatisfied with is that some areas have adopted the method of conscripting labor and goods, which has increased the burden on the people. Chiang specifically and solemnly pointed out that from now on, the GRA will no longer support any areas that adopt this type of method. Another thing that Chiang deeply abhors is that a large number of UNRRA supplies are being transferred to contractors, and some people are enriching themselves, so that the workers cannot get the real benefits. He expressed his determination to find a way to eradicate this. He also said, "From now on, those who do not work will not be allowed to obtain food." When talking about future work plans, Chiang said that winter is approaching, so it is necessary to prepare winter clothing in advance, and to list agricultural work as the top priority. Chiang continued to describe the difficulties of the GRA, believing that the most troublesome thing is funding. Although the government budget includes a huge amount of post-war relief funds, the GRA has not received a penny. To date, the GRA relies entirely on borrowing and selling supplies to maintain operations. The second most troublesome thing is transportation difficulties. At present, both water and land transportation are insufficient. Therefore, despite the opposition from the shipping industry, he still advocates using external transportation, because the more transport and distribution there is, the more UNRRA will deliver to us.

### Report from the Shanghai Branch Director on Recent Work

At the second general meeting held in the afternoon, Wang Renlin, deputy director of the Shanghai Branch, reported on the branch's recent work, stating that the industrial sector in Shanghai has suffered the most severe disasters. Therefore, the branch's work focuses more on "post-war" than on "relief." From October 12 of last year to the end of July of this year, the main task was to carry out emergency relief. Over the past nine months, 970,000 people have received subsidies and relief supplies, and a total of 11,720 tons of flour have been distributed. Among the relief recipients, 72,000 were unemployed workers, which was done under the order of the Executive Yuan and was completed last month. The branch has sent a total of 1,272 refugees, and only a little more than 600 people have not been sent out. They can be sent out by the end of this month. In May of this year, the branch convened a meeting of various charitable organizations and other relevant agencies, hoping that each agency would not rely solely on the GRA's supplies. Since June, the branch's supply of materials has been issued at an 80% discount, and then an 80% discount again in July, in the hope that it can gradually reduce reliance, and that by the end of the year, it will often be able to no longer rely on the branch. The second important work is health relief, including the distribution of medical equipment, the establishment of free hospital beds, and the allocation of cod liver oil and milk powder, etc. As of the end of July, a total of more than 9,000 pounds of cod liver oil and 73,000 cans of condensed milk have been distributed. After entering the office, they also organized epidemic prevention work, which can be completed by the end of this month.

### Mayor of Yingkou and Others Commit Malfeasance; Unauthorized Sale of Houses and Forced Donations; Northeast District Investigation Team Has Reported Them

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 4th] The Northeast District Takeover and Investigation Team today released a report exposing the illegal acts of former Yingkou Mayor Fang Yin-zhi, Councilor He Da-qian, and former Police Chief Lou De-pu. The mayor and others entered Yingkou with the National Army on April 2. On the pretext of financial difficulties, they recruited people from all walks of life to form a Financial Reorganization Committee. The committee took over 97 buildings and, under the name of troop support and without permission, sold more than 12 million yuan in circulation vouchers. There were many abuses in the selling prices and methods. They also threatened merchants and forced donations, totaling 7.4 million yuan, which were not included in the city government's accounting and were arbitrarily spent. Enemy and puppet supplies were not listed in a clear inventory, and items such as 629 boxes of cigarettes, 30 large barrels of yu leaves, and furniture were handled without authorization. In addition, before the Communist army captured Yingkou, Police Chief Lou De-pu borrowed 700,000 yuan in circulation vouchers from the city's Chamber of Commerce. He used 200,000 yuan, and the remaining 500,000 yuan were disputed between the mayor and himself, and they refused to return it, forcing the Chamber of Commerce to make up for it themselves, which is clearly fraudulent. In addition to Mayor Fang Yin-zhi, who has been notified to be detained by the authorities in Shenyang, orders have been issued to Yingkou and Anshan to detain Councilor He Da-qian and Lou De-pu (currently working in Anshan) and transfer them to Shenyang for investigation.

### Pro-Communist Elements Employed by UNRRA; Sabotage Relief Plans for China; GRA Representative in the U.S. Accuses the United States

[United Press, Washington, 4th] The Chinese GRA representative in the United States today accused the United States of employing pro-Communist elements in UNRRA's China Branch to sabotage the agency's relief plans for China, embarrassing the Nanjing government. Other Chinese representatives of the GRA unanimously expressed dissatisfaction with UNRRA's actions in China, saying that the difficulties encountered by the agency were entirely the result of its policies. The repeated changes of branch directors and the vacillation of policy have made it difficult for relief efforts to proceed, and branch officials often quarrel. They hope that the new branch director, Aagerton, will be able to rectify the situation. They also said that although UNRRA Director LaGuardia issued a ban, the Shanghai branch continued to receive supplies from the headquarters as usual when needed. Expanding relief plans for China depends on improving transportation, but UNRRA has not provided any assistance in this regard.

### Zhang Zhizhong Returns to Dihua After Inspecting Yining

### Qiantang River Seawall Project; Preparatory Work Completed; Construction to Begin in Early November and Be Completed in June Next Year

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 5th] Our reporter interviewed Wang Huzhen, deputy director and chief engineer of the Qiantang River Seawall Engineering Bureau, on the 4th. He said that the preparatory work for the Qiantang River seawall project has been largely completed. The first step is to protect the beaches and repair the collapsed stone seawalls. This work is scheduled to begin in early November and is expected to be completed by the end of June next year. Yesterday morning, he went to Zheshanzhen, 50 miles away from Hangzhou, to survey the stone used for beach protection and seawall repair, but the mountain is too far from the river and transportation is inconvenient, so he plans to turn to the mountains on the north bank of the Qiantang River Bridge for stone. The work of dredging the river and making it follow a certain deep channel is also being planned. The reporter asked about the requests from various counties in eastern Zhejiang to repair the seawalls. He replied that the Xijiang Seawall is also important, and several sluice gates in the Cao'e River are blocked. These are all within the scope of the bureau's work and will be carried out slowly. Tang Zhenxu, deputy chief engineer of the bureau, came to Hangzhou on the 4th and told the reporter that the members of the seawall project inspection team who returned to Shanghai have submitted a report, which is now being organized and will be used as a reference for the bureau.

### Many Robberies in Jiangnan; Changshu Small Transports Encounter Robberies in Succession, Suffering Significant Losses; Former Wuxi Enemy Secret Agent Becomes Bandit and Is Finally Captured

[Our Changshu Correspondent] Robberies are rampant here, and robbery cases occur frequently. The Luyifeng Brick and Tile Shop outside the Dadongmen was robbed by more than 20 bandits on the morning of the 2nd. The north shift of the Yuelai Steamboat Bureau outside the Ximen was ambushed by bandits in the Lake Bridge area, suffering significant losses. Changkun and Kunsha, two ships outside the Dongmen, were also robbed near the ice factory. The police are currently investigating.

[Our Jiangyin Correspondent] Recently, the bandit atmosphere in the four villages has been very strong, and the people are uneasy. The residents of Wangjiabao and four other households in Xiebei Township and Fanjiadai near the city were robbed again by bandits late at night on the 1st. The house of Zhang A'mao, a resident of Zhangjiaxiang, Bishan Township, Zhouzhuang District, was also invaded and robbed by bandits on the 29th of last month, suffering significant losses. There are also gangs of bandits operating in Sigang and Haiba Townships, all with guns and ammunition. The authorities have joined forces with their subordinates to strengthen the suppression.

[Our Wuxi Correspondent] Chen Shigen, a villager from Autonomy Experimental Township in this county, was robbed of 800,000 yuan in legal tender by bandits Gao Genru and Jiang A'huan with guns in Dadun, Yuqi, on July 31. Later, Gao Genru was captured by the township's self-defense force. Jiang, on the other hand, escaped by jumping over the roof. He sneaked into Wuxi yesterday and was arrested by the county government's political police at the railway station. During the enemy puppet period, Jiang served as a secret agent for the enemy garrison team in Shitangwan, committing all kinds of evils such as rape, robbery, and drug trafficking. His arrest this time has greatly pleased the people.

[Our Wujin Correspondent] Majishan is a mountain island in the center of Taihu Lake in the southeast. The vast expanse of water has always been a haunt for lake bandits. The towns along the lake in southern Wuxi and the ships traveling to and from have been frequently robbed, and the situation is very rampant. In order to strengthen defense, the township has recently added ten defensive works at various ports of the mountain, in addition to the five existing bunkers guarded by the garrison, and mobilized all the strong men on the mountain to guard day and night in shifts and tighten inspections.

Handheld Telephone

Tian Chengwen Successfully Researches and Develops

Each radio wave has a wavelength of about two and a half meters. Only a very small antenna is needed to make a call.

### Robbery of Escorted Bandit Prisoner; Fighting Occurs in Jiading

Principal Offender Tan Siyuan Shot and Killed on the Spot

[Our Jiading Correspondent] Bandit Tan Siyuan organized a puppet team during the occupation of the county, killing people and stealing goods, tyrannizing the villages, colluding with the enemy puppets, and harming anti-Japanese patriots. After the victory, the county government arrested him based on accusations. After questioning and confirming the evidence, he was escorted to the Provincial Security Command on the 29th of last month. Unexpectedly, the bandit party was very powerful and had already received the news. When the escorting party arrived near the Jiqing Temple on the Shigang Township highway, they were intercepted and robbed, and fighting broke out between the two sides. Upon receiving the report, the county government immediately dispatched the head of the military affairs section, leading a team of security team soldiers, to encircle and arrest them. The robbers had already fled without a trace. Only the principal offender, Tan Siyuan, was found lying dead by the roadside, apparently shot and killed by stray bullets during the fighting between the soldiers and bandits. In addition to reporting to the local court for verification, the county government is strictly pursuing the escaped robbers and bringing them to justice.

Editorial

### Who Made the Situation in China Serious?

We initially thought the Five-Man Group could begin negotiations the day before yesterday, and placed hopes on a successful attempt. Who knew that when Zhou Enlai left Shanghai, his saying "attempt" already implied unwillingness to succeed? Therefore, after arriving in Nanjing, the Five-Man Group did not immediately convene, and yesterday there were even rumors of it being shelved and aborted. Although Marshal Ma Siling is still meeting, trying to break the deadlock, and the two government representatives, Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Lisheng, still express their desire for success, Zhou Enlai directly said "the situation is serious," indicating that the CCP representatives, besides using the "delay" method of requesting instructions from Yan'an, are still holding on to "preconditions" and avoiding the convening of the Five-Man Group that they had previously agreed to. This is where the "situation is serious" is rooted.

The serious situation in China, in fact, did not start today. Since the beginning of the Japanese surrender last year, when General Zhu De issued a plain-language telegram in Yan'an to seize the surrender, the situation has been serious every day for the past year, and the severity has only deepened day by day. Although in the middle there was CCP leader Mao Zedong's trip to Chongqing, the issuance of repeated cease-fire orders, the holding of the Political Consultative Conference, and the signing of the reorganization and unification plan, all of this seems to have been merely the CCP's process of consolidating and developing the "liberated areas" while implementing its "overall strategy" in accordance with the times. They are nothing more than pavilions used by the CCP to rest its feet on its march to seize the entire regime. Therefore, "fighting" is certainly serious, but "talking" is also serious. According to the previous way of talking, talking is just a short break between two major battles. How could this kind of tea-drinking talk not be serious? This kind of talk fundamentally cannot be considered a "political solution."

The CCP shouts for peace in words but actually believes in fighting; this is the reason for the serious situation in China. Not only that, but the CCP superficially hopes for world peace, but in fact, it strives to make China a hotbed for a third world war. This is the real crux of why the situation in China is becoming increasingly serious. The secret documents of the CCP discovered in various newspapers a few days ago now reveal that they are based on the orders of the World Revolutionary Action Committee. It turns out that what the CCP hopes for and implements is its long-dreamed-of "world revolution" strategy in China. The CCP's important figures are merely dreaming that a third world war might break out, and this future war is precisely the hotbed of world revolution, and the CCP has the task of pre-arranging this hotbed in China. The reason why the situation in China has become increasingly serious over the past year is the result of the CCP's deliberate and dedicated efforts to arrange this hotbed. The CCP created this serious situation, but Zhou Enlai was the first to shout "the situation is serious," as if he was deeply afraid of the severity. This is just like a robber who robs someone and then shouts to the neighbors that they have been robbed, which is a similar trick.

However, we must awaken those who dream of a third world war with a word: Regardless of whether a third world war will happen or not, even if it does happen and is imminent, will another world war be beneficial to China? Of course, we also know that the CCP does not take China's interests into account, but in any case, the CCP loudly sings anti-Americanism and strongly shows pro-Soviet sentiment within China, deliberately trying to create a sense of closeness and distance, even friendship and enmity, between our two major allies, the United States and the Soviet Union, so that the rifts that seem to exist in the overall world situation are first revealed in China, even to the point of sacrificing China as a battlefield for the future world war dreamed of by the CCP. Surely their conscience is somewhat uneasy.

Therefore, we believe that today's overall situation in China is a matter of China's internal affairs and should not be linked to the international situation at all times and in all places. The more the CCP wants to create a third world war in China, the more we should quickly eliminate this factor that could lead to a major war. And the way to start is to sincerely talk if we can, or resolutely abandon the appeasement policy. If there is no decisiveness, then appeasement will only harbor evil, and the situation will only become more serious!

### Examination of the Colonial Policies of the Great Powers

The Chinese delegation has proposed to the Paris Peace Conference that the former Italian colony of Libya should be declared independent immediately, or if this is not possible, it should be submitted to a UN agency for trusteeship for several years, after which it should be declared independent. This just call not only shows China's enlightened attitude towards the world's colonies, but also China's consistent sympathy for the lives of people in various colonies under foreign rule, which can be clearly demonstrated here. Therefore, after the Chinese representative put forward such a proposal, it has aroused the attention and importance of countries around the world. In order to make it easier for all countries to understand the motivation of China's proposal, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie specially hosted the press in Paris the day before yesterday evening to clarify the open and honest attitude of the Chinese delegation. He said: "China does not want to demand territorial concessions or reparations at the Paris Peace Conference, but it has to make such a proposal regarding the disposal of Italy's former colonies."

Colonies are the product of the era of capitalist imperialism and are also the source of international disputes, conflicts, and even wars. The First World War can certainly be regarded as a war between Britain and Germany to compete for colonies, and the root cause of the outbreak of the Second World War was also that the problem of the three fascist countries, Germany, Italy, and Japan, demanding colonies could not be resolved. Therefore, far-sighted politicians and diplomats have long foreseen that if international disputes, conflicts, and wars are to be eliminated, the colonial system must be eradicated fundamentally. As former US President Roosevelt said at the Casablanca Conference in 1943: "The colonial system is tantamount to war. It is an inconceivable mistake to think that the US military is shedding blood and fighting in the Pacific for the colonies of Britain, France, and the Netherlands!"

It cannot be said that the success of President Roosevelt's ideals was not crucial to the United Nations' victory in this war. If we want to create peace after the war and lead the world into a new era of peace and democracy, we must follow President Roosevelt's will and continue to work hard to implement it. But in fact, after the war, the great powers, whether in the Council of Foreign Ministers of the five countries in September last year or in the Council of Foreign Ministers of the four countries in May this year, all took their own interests as the starting point when discussing the former Italian colonies, and failed to take President Roosevelt's legacy as the basis for discussing this issue. Therefore, there are no concrete provisions for the disposal of Italy's former colonies in the draft treaty of peace with Italy. The Chinese delegation put forward this amendment to make up for this defect. If it can be passed as desired, all countries in the world will be able to understand the attitude of the great powers towards colonies. Therefore, whether in theory or in practice, the proposal of the Chinese delegation is worthy of close consideration by the representatives of all countries.

Before the war, the great powers competed for "spheres of influence" in various important regions of the world, which was certainly an evil consequence of the colonial system; but after the war, there was also the saying of "security zones," which was loudly chanted, but in fact, it was also the remaining poison of the colonial system. To put it bluntly, it is nothing more than wanting to be "the knife and chopping board, and others the fish and meat," using the beautiful name of "security zone" to actually practice the method of enslaving others. Looking ahead to the future of the world, it is probably still very far from the era of eliminating the colonial system. But in any case, mankind should have a spirit of progress and fight against all dark forces. The Chinese delegation's proposal that Libya should be declared independent immediately, or at least be placed under UN trusteeship until it is fully independent before independence, can be regarded as a major test of the colonial policies of the great powers.

[Reuters, Paris, 4th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin and US Secretary of State Byrnes recently met three times in Paris to discuss the German issue. Byrnes is scheduled to go to Stuttgart, Germany, on Friday, where he will deliver a speech expounding the US policy on Germany.

### UN Secretary-General Announces General Assembly Will Convene as Scheduled, Greek Representative Attends Security Council, Vigorously Criticizes Remarks of Ukrainian Representative

[United Press, Lake Success, New York, 4th] The UN General Assembly is ordered to convene on the 23rd of this month as scheduled. The Soviet Union's opposition has been ignored. Secretary-General Lie made this statement today and said that he had not received a formal request for postponement. The General Assembly is scheduled to open at 9 pm (standard time) on the 23rd at Flushing Town Hall in New York State, with opening remarks by President Truman and General Assembly President Spaak (Belgian Foreign Minister).

[Central News Agency, Paris, 4th, United Press] The UK and the US recently opposed the Soviet proposal to postpone the UN General Assembly to November in Paris or Geneva. This proposal was made by Vyshinsky to the Council of Four Foreign Ministers and was opposed. The meeting remained deadlocked on this issue. According to this inconclusive meeting of the four powers, it was convened on the eve of Byrnes's trip to Germany.

[Our Report] Paris, 5th: Broadcast from Lake Success, USA: At 3:45 pm today, the Security Council held its 61st meeting. The Greek representative attended and made a generous statement, vigorously criticizing the complaint filed by Ukraine. It is said that Greece is an independent and free country, and any foreign interference is not allowed. He went on to say that he could present various facts to prove that Greece not only does not threaten Balkan peace, but is a factor of peace, and that those who endanger peace are others.

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, New York, 4th] The UN Security Council met today to discuss the Ukrainian complaint against Greece. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Manuilsky spoke for three hours. In his speech, he criticized the UK as much as he criticized Greece. He said that the UK has established armed forces in Greece, and the facts are there. British troops have supplied Greek farmers with weapons, ordering them to join the British army. British Foreign Secretary Bevin and Prime Minister Attlee promised that British troops would withdraw from Greece immediately after the Greek plebiscite. This promise has not been fulfilled. The situation has deteriorated and civil war will eventually break out. Representatives of the Security Council should listen to the statements of the Greek democratic leaders in order to understand the truth of the situation. Since the current Greek government took office in March of this year, it has implemented cleansing actions in the military and political fields, attempting to eliminate democratic elements, and at the same time dissolving trade unions. The suppression actions launched by the Greek government are in fact aimed at domestic ethnic minorities, especially the Slavic people. As for the recent plebiscite, it was the result of British interference in Greek internal affairs. The UK has made every effort to disarm the "Leftist National United Front" in Greece, British military officers have participated in the Greek suppression operations, and the UK controls the Greek economy. All of these violate Article 2, Paragraph 7 of the UN Charter. The Security Council must stop British interference in Greek internal affairs, clarify the situation in the country, and ensure the holding of a free plebiscite. As far as Greece's border disputes with Albania are concerned, Greece's intention to invade is not only aimed at Albania, but also at Yugoslavia. This intention endangers Balkan peace and security. In short, the Security Council should take appropriate steps to ensure the peace sought by the entire United Nations. The Greek representative is scheduled to respond to Mr. Manuilsky's accusations today.

### Soviet Union Will Launch Diplomatic Offensive to Maintain Prestige

[United Press, London, 4th] Diplomatic sources predicted today that the Soviet Union will soon launch a massive diplomatic offensive in Eastern Europe and the Middle East to restore its prestige on the sidelines. The Soviet Union's recent setback was the result of the Greek plebiscite, which decided to welcome King George II back to the country. These people believe that other facts that have damaged the Soviet Union's prestige are roughly as follows: (1) The visit of the US fleet to Greece, which the Soviet side considers an example of atomic diplomacy. (2) In the recent negotiations between the United States and South American countries over the aircraft incident, the Soviet Union failed to provide Tito with practical support. (3) Turkey has taken a firm stance against Soviet demands to control the Dardanelles and acquire Turkish territory. (4) Due to the deployment of British troops to Iraq and other reasons, the pro-Soviet policy of Iran's left-wing parties seems to have encountered increasing resistance. (5) The labor movement in Poland has failed to satisfy the UK and the US.

### Egyptian Cabinet Resigns

### US Fleet Arrives in Athens, Reports of Joint US-UK-Turkish Naval Exercises Unconfirmed

[Our Report] London, 5th: The US aircraft carrier "Roosevelt" arrived in Athens today and is scheduled to stay for four days. The originally planned air show has been cancelled. It is said that this order came from diplomatic officials.

[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 5th] The US fleet, which has been patrolling the Mediterranean, arrived near Phaleron Bay this morning. The fleet includes the aircraft carrier "Roosevelt," three cruisers, and two destroyers. Fleet Commander Admiral Callaghan immediately landed and visited the Greek Regent and other dignitaries. The Greek government will invite the admiral and his staff to lunch.

[Agence France-Presse, Istanbul, 5th] The governments of the UK and the US have notified Turkey that part of the UK and US fleets intend to visit the Turkish port of Izmir. The Turkish authorities have not yet responded. It is generally believed that the US aircraft carrier "Roosevelt" and other warships currently stationed in the Eastern Mediterranean will be among the ships visiting the Turkish fleet.

[Reuters, Istanbul, 5th] The Turkish fleet, led by the cruiser "Yavuz," sailed to Izmir last night to meet with the British fleet sailing in the Aegean Sea. Turkish officials have not confirmed reports that the UK and US fleets plan to conduct joint exercises in the Aegean Sea.

### Greek Prime Minister Represents People in London to Welcome King, Conflicts Between Two Factions Erupt Domestically

[Agence France-Presse, London, 5th] Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris, after arriving here last night, said in a statement that the Greek people have expressed their desire to welcome the king back to the country, so the king can return to the country at any time. My arrival here is not to invite the king back to the country, because the whole of Greece has already made this invitation.

### Major Changes Expected in Relations Between US, UK, and Soviet Union

[Agence France-Presse, London, 4th] According to well-informed sources here: There are now various reasons to believe that major changes are about to occur in the relations between the US, UK, and Soviet Union. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's trip to Moscow proves that UK-Soviet relations have reached a turning point. Regarding this level, it is necessary to review various past facts in order to understand the outline. The relations between the three powers, especially the relations between the UK and the Soviet Union, deteriorated from the beginning of the victory. The United States was in the position of mediator, and the overall situation changed after former British Prime Minister Churchill visited the United States. Since then, President Truman and Secretary of State Byrnes have become increasingly firm in their attitude towards the Soviet Union, while the UK has stood by. This firm attitude of the United States has not been approved by the UK Foreign Office and military, but in the past few weeks, the UK political circles have begun to express considerable anxiety. American newspapers have spoken of the inevitability of a new war, but British public opinion has begun to adopt a more moderate policy towards the Soviet Union. This attitude has been expressed in the recent dispute between the United States and Yugoslavia (the US plane being shot down by South Country). At that time, although the UK agreed with the US ultimatum to South Country, it hoped that the matter would be resolved peacefully. British newspapers reflected this hope, not only the Labor Party newspapers and the left-wing newspapers, but even some local liberal newspapers, after learning of the Soviet Union's views, also advocated renewed efforts. The Labor Party delegation to the Soviet Union returned to London around this time. There is little doubt that the report submitted by the delegation to Prime Minister Attlee was more optimistic. It is said that the report does not involve foreign policy, but Professor Laski (Chairman of the Labor Party Executive Committee, that is, the head of the delegation to the Soviet Union) and his colleagues gave the impression that if the British government could express greater understanding of the internal affairs of Eastern European countries, there would be a possibility of coordination between the communist parties of Central European countries and the British Labor Party. At the same time, Marshal Stalin seemed to regard Professor Laski as Prime Minister Attlee's direct representative. For this reason, when the Soviet Union repeatedly requested to amend the Montreux Convention (the convention that guarantees the neutrality of the Turkish Straits), there was a clear trend in London to seek a basis for some common understanding with the Soviet Union. The issue of the Turkish Straits forced the UK to choose between two paths. One is to recognize the Soviet Union as a potential enemy, strengthen US-Soviet ties, exclude the Soviet Union from the Tatar Strait and the entire Middle East, and maintain the airfields in Turkey. The other path is to seek a basis for understanding with a major country, promote UK-Soviet relations, and resolve the Turkish Straits issue in accordance with the 1915 treaty. One of the above two paths must be chosen. If the UK Cabinet had discussed this issue a week ago, it is almost certain that Stansted, the UK's representative in negotiations with Egypt, would have attended. At this time, Foreign Secretary Bevin received a notice from French Foreign Minister Bidault, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, and US Secretary of State Byrnes to attend an emergency meeting of the four foreign ministers. Therefore, Bevin remained in Paris, Stansted remained in Egypt, and the UK Cabinet meeting was also postponed. In short, there are now various reasons to believe that the Soviet Union has decided to seriously study this issue. Only in this way did Molotov return to Moscow to ask for instructions. The promotion of UK-Soviet relations depends on the results of this trip.

### US and Canada Speeding Up Joint Arctic Defense, Both Sides' Armies Will Continue Extensive Arctic Exercises

[Our Report] San Francisco, 5th: According to reliable sources in Washington, the chiefs of staff of the United States and Canada are speeding up defense work to prevent attacks from the Arctic. The increasing advancement of long-range aircraft makes Arctic defense increasingly important. US and Canadian forces will continue to conduct extensive Arctic exercises. When Marshal Montgomery visits Washington in September, he will roughly discuss joint Arctic defense with General Eisenhower. Starting this Saturday, B-119 bombers will take off from Hawaii, cross the Arctic, and reach Cairo, which further demonstrates the importance of Arctic defense. The US Navy has sent submarines and aircraft carriers to the Arctic waters to explore the ocean conditions. It is said that the range of the new US B-36 bomber reaches 10,000 miles. If these aircraft are based in Alaska, they can attack any location in northern Europe and Asia. At the same time, similar large aircraft can also attack the United States and Canada from northern Europe and Asia via the Arctic.

### Overseas Chinese in Germany Celebrate Victory

(Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 4th) Overseas Chinese in Berlin held a grand meeting on September 3 to celebrate the first anniversary of the victory over Japan. The meeting was hosted by the Chinese military delegation.

### Foreign Minister Wang's Remarks in Paris: Advocates for Libyan Independence; Greater Confidence Needed for Creating Peace and Security

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 4th] Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, hosting reporters here tonight, expressed his belief that the Paris Peace Conference would be successful. He stated, "Although various debates and disputes have arisen at the Paris Peace Conference, I believe it will be successful. I believe we must have greater confidence in creating world peace and security. In particular, creating peace treaties with Germany and Japan is even more important. Unless significant efforts are made immediately after the closure of this conference to create an atmosphere of friendship among the major powers, I do not believe that the major powers will be able to reach an agreement on treaties with these two Axis powers. China, in this conference, is neither seeking territory nor reparations, but has made a suggestion regarding the disposition of Italian colonies. It is a modern historical innovation for representatives of the victorious Allied nations to gather together to determine the legal status of the defeated countries' colonies. The conference must make it clear to the world that the former Italian colonies should be placed under governments acceptable to the local residents. Taking Libya as an example, the Chinese delegation proposed that it should be made independent immediately, and if that is not possible, it should be placed under the trusteeship of a United Nations body. If the countries agree to the latter, the term of the trusteeship should be decided, so as not to repeat the mistakes of the League of Nations mandate system in the past. Therefore, the Chinese representative has made a proposal to the Territorial and Political Commission on Italy, believing that the basic principles of trusteeship stipulated in the United Nations Charter must be implemented in Libya. The conference should ideally inform the residents of the area that the conference has considered their interests and wishes as basic conditions for dealing with the former Italian colonies. This attitude, in the eyes of countries around the world, is sufficient to be seen as the policy adopted by the United Nations on the issue of colonies. Of course, a similar solution cannot be adopted for all former Italian colonies. But we also cannot deny the fact that Libya, compared to other colonies, is a colony that has been developed to a considerable extent. Therefore, the Chinese representative requested the conference to submit the following recommendations to the Council of Foreign Ministers: (1) The Treaty of Peace with Italy must stipulate the immediate independence of Libya. (2) If this recommendation cannot be accepted by all countries, Libya should be submitted to the United Nations for trusteeship for a certain number of years, but the United Nations must guarantee that Libya will declare its independence after the expiration of the trusteeship."

### Three Recommendations on the Trieste Issue

[Reuters, Paris, 4th] When the Italian Political and Economic Committee of the Paris Peace Conference debated the most thorny issue of Trieste today, it received a total of three specific recommendations: (1) Internationalization of western Istria, (2) Establishment of another expert committee to propose a new plan, (3) Amendment of the proposed demarcation method to seek the inclusion of the city of Rijeka into Yugoslavia. As a result, no resolution has yet been formed on these three items. The first item was proposed by South Africa, because most of the residents there are Italians, and Britain and France expressed their support, but Belarus opposed it, believing that Yugoslavia should not be deprived of a suitable outlet to the sea, because the four powers originally suggested that the area belong to the South. The second suggestion was proposed by Brazilian representative Fandula, who believed that the current plan could not satisfy any party, and said that maintaining the status quo for another year would be enough to endanger peace there. The third suggestion was proposed by Belarusian representative Kislov, who said that the city is surrounded by Slavs, and the Italians deliberately gathered in the city. Before the adjournment, Senator Connally, an advisor to Byrnes, had earnestly asked all representatives to keep world peace in mind.

The Military Committee of the Conference today completed its study of the articles restricting the Italian army, navy, and air force, and tentatively passed the clauses preventing Italy from assisting Germany and Japan in rearming.

### Bulgaria's Territorial Expansion Demands
Greek Representative Refutes Harshly

[Reuters, Paris, 4th] At today's meeting of the Bulgarian Political and Territorial Committee, the Greek representative, Tsaldaris, harshly refuted Bulgaria's demand for West Thrace, pointing out that this was further proof of Bulgarian expansionism. Unexpectedly, on the day after Bulgaria's defeat, it used the opportunity to be allowed to attend the peace conference and state its views, to demand the division of an Allied nation, which is truly an important warning, which we must never forget. If the request is granted, then 250,000 Greeks and 1,000 Turks will have to flee under Bulgarian rule. Article 1 of the Bulgarian peace treaty has already given Bulgaria fertile land. If Greece's legitimate demands are met, Greece is prepared to support this provision. As for Greece's demand to adjust the Greek-Bulgarian border, it is based on the needs of national defense, because Greece has been invaded by Bulgaria three times. Bulgaria's protection of the southern flank of the German army can be said to have made a special contribution to Hitler. When the Bulgarian army occupied Greece, 100,000 people were forced to leave their homes, and 5,048 Jews were expelled, of whom only 122 returned. The narrow strip of land in eastern Greece bordering Bulgaria is the weakest part of Europe. Bulgaria can concentrate its troops within eight days to launch an invasion. The strategically high ground is all within Bulgaria, and the invaders can easily occupy Thessaloniki, cutting off the Greek army's retreat, as was the case when the German army invaded Greece in 1941. The committee then decided to discuss this issue on Friday.

### Britain Sends Separate Invitations to Jewish Groups; Jewish Association Refuses to Participate

### The United States May Declare the Case Closed If Yugoslavia Agrees to Compensation; Clayton Issues Statement on the Downing of the American Plane

[United States Information Service, Washington, 4th] Acting Secretary of State Clayton said at a press conference today, "A total of five people died as a result of the Yugoslav attack on the American plane. Yesterday, the United States sent a note to Yugoslavia to conclude the exchange of documents between the United States and Yugoslavia regarding this incident. Regarding this note, Clayton believes that if the issue of Yugoslav compensation can be resolved, this matter can be brought to a close." He pointed out that Marshal Tito had expressed his apologies for the loss of American lives and guaranteed that he would no longer shoot down cross-border planes, even if the planes failed to fly according to signal instructions. When a reporter asked what the situation would be if Marshal Tito refused to pay compensation, Clayton said: "He hopes that this issue will be resolved satisfactorily and that there will be no need for a third party to mediate." Mr. Clayton also said: "The State Department will consult with the American military authorities in the area where the plane took off in order to draw up a list of compensations in the short term." When a reporter asked what the United States' opinion was on the proposed Soviet-Swedish trade agreement, Mr. Clayton said: "The United States has not taken any new action on this proposed agreement. The previous American note mentioned that the motivations of the two countries were purely to strengthen multilateral trade, because the United States originally intended to establish this trade relationship universally around the world."

### American Hydraulic Engineers Demonstrate Superb Skill: Canals Dug in the Rocky Mountains

[Associated Press, Washington, 4th] American engineers are now demonstrating superb skill, allowing water to flow even where there is no water in nature. Irrigation canals have been dug in the Rocky Mountains to supply water to hundreds of thousands of acres of farmland. The greatest of these projects is the Adams Tunnel, which passes through the Rocky Mountains near Estes Park in northern Colorado. At thirteen miles long, it is the longest irrigation canal in the world. The tunnel was excavated simultaneously from both sides of the mountain in 1940 and was finally connected in 1944. Next year, water from the western slope of the Rockies can be diverted to the eastern slope. The tunnel is ten feet in diameter and is paved with concrete. There are also two shorter tunnels, one 1.3 miles long and one 1.1 miles long, that branch off from the eastern entrance of the Adams Tunnel to divert part of the water to various power plants. Once the reservoirs and other projects are completed, the project can irrigate 615,000 acres of farmland and power many power plants.

### American Tractor Experts Depart for Shanghai Yesterday

They are all sent by the Dunker Church, a religious group, and are paid $20 a month, with the church paying $15 and the Chinese government paying $10.

### American Pacific Coast Sailors Launch General Strike

[Associated Press, San Francisco, 4th] Russell, secretary of the Pacific Coast Sailors' Union, said today that approximately 8,000 sailors are scheduled to go on strike across the coast starting at 6:00 p.m. on the 5th. Bayan, president of the Pacific American Shipowners Association, has flown to Washington, where he said he will tell the Stabilization Board that there is no background to the board's order to reduce the wage increase from US$22.50 per month to US$17.50. At the same time, sailors in Pacific ports have begun to leave their ships in preparation for the strike, and workers in other ports will also strike at any time, with the number of strikers reaching 400,000. As a result, all relief supplies shipped by the United Nations to China and ports in the East will be suspended.

### Manila Overseas Chinese District Raided by Philippine Military Police Yesterday; 35 Overseas Chinese Arrested

[Associated Press, Manila, 5th] Philippine military police today searched the Chinese News Agency, Hongguang College, and United High School in the Overseas Chinese district in downtown Manila, arresting approximately 35 Overseas Chinese. Chinese Consul General Duan Maolan said that he had received a notice from the military police stating that the Overseas Chinese were being detained for questioning and routine investigation and registration of the newspaper, and that the Overseas Chinese were not formally arrested, and there was no notice as to when they would be released.

[United Press, Manila, 5th] According to a report from the military police, more than 900 Philippine guerrillas, members of the National Farmers' Federation, and members of the Democratic League have been taken into custody by authorities in the provinces of Bulacan, Pampanga, Tarlac, etc. It is expected that all those detained, except for extreme radicals, will be released soon.

### Former French Municipal Council: Concealed Real Estate Valued at 200 Billion; Puppet Government Stole and Sold 51 Acres; Decided to Publicly Announce Priceless Recovery

[This newspaper] Regarding the former French Consulate in Shanghai concealing the publicly-owned real estate of the former French Municipal Council, the reporter learned the following details from relevant parties yesterday: When the French Concession existed, the French Municipal Council owned a total of more than 1,008 acres of real estate, according to the land register published by the council in 1941. However, after the victory, the Shanghai Land Administration Bureau only received more than 634 acres of former French Municipal Council real estate from the puppet government. The difference of more than 300 acres has long been clarified by our land administration authorities. It is estimated that more than 272 acres were concealed by the French side when the puppet government took over the French Concession and were not handed over. More than 51 acres have been sold by the puppet municipal government. Another 56 acres were sold by the French Vichy government. It is reported that although the purchasers of the real estate sold by the puppet government are nominally ordinary citizens, the figures behind the scenes are certain real estate tycoons and traitor Chen Bijun who had dealings with the puppet government at the time. Now, the transfer of property rights disposed of by the puppet government has been stipulated by the Executive Yuan to be invalid, and it is said that the Land Administration Bureau will publicly announce its priceless recovery in the near future. As for the real estate sold by the Vichy government, after the municipal government consulted with the Executive Yuan, it was stipulated that transfers before the establishment of the puppet municipal government in the 31st year were valid, and those after that were invalid. However, in fact, most of this real estate, which is valued at about 30 billion yuan, was sold before the 31st year. The total value of the real estate concealed by the French consulate is estimated to be more than 100 billion yuan, close to 200 billion yuan. Its concealment method is very clever. For example, Fuxing Park and the land behind the park originally had three title deeds, totaling more than 140 acres, but the French consulate initially concealed the title deeds and only transferred a separate title deed for the 136 acres of the Jiang Gongguo part to the puppet side. Some properties were claimed to have been sold by the Municipal Council to the French government. Although the Land Administration Bureau has investigated clearly, it has not been able to deal with it immediately because this matter involves diplomatic relations between the two countries.

### American Court Tries Two War Criminals; Cruel Methods of Abusing Prisoners of War; Forced to Stand at Attention Below Zero; Appendectomy Without Anesthesia

[This newspaper] Colonel Matsuda, former director of the Changchun Japanese prisoner of war management office, and Captain Kawashima, a medical officer, who abused American prisoners of war, were brought to trial by the American military court yesterday. The two criminals answered "not guilty" to the question of whether they pleaded guilty, just like the criminals in the "Hoke Case" in the past.

Prosecutor William Fowler, a lieutenant, alleged that American prisoners in the Changchun prisoner of war camp were severely abused at the time. One hundred and forty of them suffered from serious diseases, and these diseases were preventable. The camp did not provide air raid shelters for the prisoners, resulting in the deaths of 24 American officers and soldiers in the bombing. Colonel Matsuda behaved violently. Once during an inspection, he ordered American soldiers to stand at attention for a long time in outdoor temperatures below zero. Many prisoners were imprisoned without interrogation if they did not comply. Three prisoners, including Captain Prady, were arrested after attempting to escape and were executed. Matsuda should be held responsible for this crime. Captain Kawashima, as a medical officer, neglected his responsibility. Once, he performed an appendectomy on Captain Corley without anesthesia. When Corley groaned and cried out in pain, he was scolded.

The defendant's defense attorneys, Lei Mang, Captain Fowler, and two Japanese lawyers, requested the court to interrogate the two defendants separately and planned to ask the Japanese government for written proof of its agreement to the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War. All of these requests were rejected.

Witnesses Lieutenant Colonel Harkins and Sergeant Gannett, who is blind, were present in court yesterday. Gannett was accompanied by his wife and was very concerned about the progress of the case.

### Rice Shop Employees Strike; Expected to be Resolved This Morning

[This newspaper] More than 4,000 employees from more than 730 large and small rice shops in the central area, Pudong, and Puxi of this city went on strike at 10:00 a.m. yesterday due to demands for improved treatment, and continued into the evening. Upon receiving the news, the Social Affairs Bureau immediately summoned both labor and management for mediation and instructed the labor side to resume work first. It is reported that the labor side decided to resume work at 9:00 a.m. this morning. The Rice Grain Industry Employees Association was still holding an emergency meeting on Gu Ba Road late last night. The reason is that the treatment of rice grain industry employees has always been low, with an average monthly income of only more than 40,000 yuan. Therefore, in early August, representatives of the Employees Association made a request to the management for improved treatment. The Social Affairs Bureau mediated and agreed to issue four dou of rice per month. The two sides were originally scheduled to sign the mediation record on the 16th, but at that time the management requested an extension to September 2, and then to the 3rd. However, the management always avoided attending the signing. At that time, the Bean Rice and Miscellaneous Grain Workers Union appeared, and the management used the excuse that the nature of the Association and the Workers Union were the same and did not know which one to sign the record with, and delayed signing. This caused the current labor unrest. It is now known that the management has agreed to sign the mediation record with the Association this morning and implement it immediately.

### Asia Petroleum Labor-Management Dispute; Partial Agreement Reached Yesterday

[This newspaper] More than 600 employees of Asia Petroleum Company went on strike yesterday due to demands for improved treatment. After the Social Affairs Bureau mediated and a partial agreement was reached on the six conditions proposed, the labor side agreed to resume work first this morning. The unresolved issues are scheduled to be discussed again this afternoon.

### Two New Warships Arrive in Shanghai from Nanjing

The eight warships, including the Taikang, donated by the United States, sailed to Nanjing last month, and two of them, the "Taiping" and "Yongxing," arrived in Shanghai yesterday. It is reported that they will be dispatched for defense.

### Four Senators from the First District; Publicly Solicit Public Opinion; General Assembly Tentatively Scheduled to be Held in Yiyuan

[This newspaper] Four senators from the first district of this city, Ma Junshuo, Li Wenjie, Dong Ganwen, and Hong Fumei, invited the heads of the district offices, Bao chiefs, and district representatives from the district to the Jinmen Hotel yesterday afternoon to publicly solicit public opinion so that they could submit it to the General Assembly. About 50 people, including Tu Kaizheng, Ying Shugui, and Jin Runxiang, attended. Ma Junshuo served as chairman. First, Li Wenjie gave a speech, stating that the first district is the center of Shanghai's industry, commerce, and finance, and its responsibilities are undoubtedly heavy. Now that the Municipal Senate is about to be held, citizens should be concerned about municipal facilities. How should we assume responsibility in the future to make Shanghai a model city in the country and meet the needs of national construction? Then, Cheng Jingyuan, the district chief of the first district, stated that the Baojia organization should be strict, the duties should be divided, and the funding should be established. We have this organization, but it is only a nominal one, which instead affects the progress of the work. Other districts claimed that municipal facilities should focus on practicality, be down-to-earth, and only focus on the surface would be useless. Ma Junshuo also reported on two proposals that had been prepared: (1) Strengthen the Baojia organization to facilitate self-government. The methods are to improve the quality of Baojia personnel, increase Baojia funding, expedite the selection of Baojia personnel by the people, hope that the Bao Min Da Hui can be held on schedule, and set up cooperatives and Bao National Schools in each Bao, depending on the local environment. (2) Regarding the pre-trial law, please ask the municipal government to forward it to the Executive Yuan to issue an order to all military and police agencies in the country to implement it earnestly, and to issue separate letters to all military and police agencies in this city to implement it earnestly.

[Another message] The site of the Municipal Senate was originally scheduled to be on Daxi Road, but because the session is very long and the terrain there is very low, it will become a swamp after rain, so it is planned to change the site to Yiyuan, which is currently being negotiated.

### Proposals by Female Senators

[This newspaper] Female Senator Lu Huimin and others proposed: (1) Establish nursery schools for working women, please ask the municipal government to do so, (2) Plan to ask the municipal government to reward house building and adjust the housing shortage, (3) Universally promote sports to save the country from weakness, (4) Please ask the municipal government to focus on suburban construction and designate new urban areas as cultural areas, (5) Please ask the municipal government to build a large-scale women's relief home.

### Does the Municipal Advisory Council Still Exist?

[This newspaper] After the establishment of the Municipal Senate in this city, the general public is quite concerned about whether the Shanghai Municipal Government's Municipal Advisory Committee will continue to exist. The reporter made a special trip to visit the relevant authorities for this matter. It is said that the committee is a purely advisory body, not a formal public opinion institution. The committee has a total of 14 members, half Chinese and half Western. The committee only exchanges opinions on municipal issues and cannot make formal resolutions, which does not conflict with the authority and nature of the Municipal Senate.

### If the Municipal Government Approves the Resumption of Horse Racing; Monthly Revenue Can Reach 540 Million; But It Depends on Whether the Senate Can Pass It

[This newspaper] The talk of resuming horse racing at the Jing'an Temple Road Racecourse is rife, and although it still needs to be approved by the Municipal Senate, it seems to have received the tacit consent of the authorities. According to the person in charge of the Racecourse, the Municipal Bureau of Finance had an informal exchange of views with Watson, the Western host of the racecourse. When horse racing is implemented, 40% of all ticket sales will be deducted, of which 20% will go to the municipal treasury and 20% will be used as income for the racecourse. It is estimated that with each business of 300 million yuan and horse racing nine times a month, the municipal government can receive 540 million yuan per month. However, due to the loss of horses (originally 500, now only 150) and the damage to the racecourse, even if the Municipal Senate can pass it, the official horse racing period must be after two months. In addition, the racecourse, in response to requests from all parties, is willing to rent out the middle empty field for sports. Those who want to use it as a tennis or soccer field can contact the racecourse authorities.

### There Are Questionable Aspects to the Materials Received in Dinghai; County Police Once Had an Armed Clash with the Navy; Lists from the Third Theater Area Are Also Incomplete; Wu Wangji Talks About His Trip to Hangzhou

[This newspaper] Clearing Committee Member Wu Wangji returned to Shanghai from Hangzhou yesterday. The reporter went to ask about the process of this trip and the focus of the Clearing Committee's work in Hangzhou. According to reports, the Clearing Committee went to Hangzhou with two main goals: One, the items received by the Navy Command in Dinghai. This area contains a large amount of military supplies, vehicles, and materials, because the enemy actively managed it before surrendering, intending to use it as a base to resist the Allied forces from landing along the coast. It was also heard that when the Navy Command went to receive it, it had a firefight with the Dinghai County Government Police, which may have been suspicious, so the Clearing Committee must go to Dinghai after going to Hangzhou. The second is for the items received by the Third Theater Area, because the materials in that area were initially received by the Third Theater Area, and then transferred to other agencies. Although the case files and reports received by all parties have been sent, the original good lists are missing and incomplete.

Clearing Committee Director Zhang Zhiben and Clearing Committee Member Zhang Qingzhen are scheduled to go to Hangzhou on the 9th of this month, and Committee Member Wu Wangji will go one or two days earlier to arrange. The investigation time in Hangzhou is one week to ten days.

The Clearing Committee has already set up a receiving office in Hangzhou, but there are very few confidential letters.

The Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau's Hangzhou office has four branch offices: Jiaxing, Shaoxing, Ningbo, and Wenzhou. As of now, the materials that have been auctioned off by the four branch offices are less than 2.5 billion in total.

The second group of the Clearing Committee has left Beijing for Suzhou. The third group is responsible for clearing Anqing. It seems that the Xuzhou side has not yet departed.

Committee Member Wu said that after the Second Clearing Committee went to Hangzhou, new cases in Shanghai will stop being accepted on the 9th of this month to the 15th of this month. However, all unfinished cases will continue to be handled. As for enemy and puppet materials that have been concealed and evaded, not much has been found recently.

### Implementing a Cleanliness Zone System; Implementation Measures Defined

The Municipal Health Bureau is developing citizens' ability to self-govern to promote indoor and outdoor cleanliness, and has specially formulated the Shanghai Municipal Temporary Implementation Measures for Promoting the Cleanliness Zone System. The measures were approved by the 38th Municipal Meeting of the Municipal Government and are scheduled to be announced and implemented in early September.

### Rong Desheng Unconcerned? $240,000 USD Repeatedly Urged to Collect, Preparing to Donate All

[Report from Our Newspaper] The confiscated stolen money, the Garrison Headquarters had previously notified Rong to come to the Military Law Office of the Headquarters at 3:00 PM yesterday to collect it. However, the "Cotton Yarn and Flour King" seemed not very interested in recovering his lost money. By the time the office closed at 6:00 PM, Rong had neither come in person nor sent someone to collect it on his behalf. Zhu, the section chief of the Military Law Office in charge of the case, made four phone calls to "urge his arrival." The first call was at 4:55 PM, made to Rong's residence. The person who answered the phone claimed to be a houseboy, saying that all the members of Rong's family were at the "15774" Hengfeng Yarn Factory. Section Chief Zhu then transferred the call to that number to inquire, and the person who answered the phone was an old quartermaster, who said that Rong and others had just left the factory to return home. At 5:10 PM, another call was made to Rong's residence, but it was said that they had not yet returned. The last phone call was made at 5:25 PM, and a member of the Rong family finally answered, saying that someone had been sent to the Garrison Headquarters in the morning, but it was to the Investigation Department for some contact, and that the money was planned to be collected tomorrow. At that time, a secretary in the office was nearby and took the call, firmly urging them to come and collect it that day, but until the closing bell "ding-donged," the piles of American dollars, legal tender, and gold piled on the desk of the head of the Military Law Office had not yet seen their "rightful owner." Because there was no safe in the Military Law Office, they had to send personnel to guard the room at night, and everyone felt deeply dissatisfied with Mr. Rong's "unconcern."

The total amount of the returned stolen money was previously reported to be more than 240,000 US dollars. In fact, only a part of it was US dollars, and the rest was the equivalent of gold and legal tender. The exact figures are still to be announced today. Yesterday, the police station sent Feng Qishan, the chief of the Criminal Investigation Section, along with staff members Zhang Changgui and others, to bring the part confiscated by the police station to the Garrison Headquarters for handover to the Military Law Office, including US$67,400, 4.6 million legal tender, one gold ring with three diamonds, one pure gold bracelet, one gold anklet, one ladies' western gold 18K watch, six pure gold rings, one pair of gold earrings, one ELBA watch, one western gold pin, and one western gold ring.

It is reported that the Rong family stated that after retrieving the stolen money, they would donate all of it to the welfare fund of military and police agencies and for the relief of refugees.

### Railway Staff Member Embezzles Goods, Investigation Has Yielded Clues, Feng Zhenbang and a Mr. Lei Flee with Goods, Jinpu Railway Bureau Offers a Reward of 500,000 Yuan for Their Arrest

[Report from Our Newspaper] The joint passenger and freight transport between the Beijing-Shanghai and Jinpu Railways recently experienced an embezzlement incident by a freight escort. Given the well-established reputation of the railway, this kind of incident is a first, so the railway authorities are paying great attention to it. A reward of 500,000 yuan has been offered for the strict arrest of Feng Zhenbang, the freight escort of the Jinpu Railway who is on the run. It is reported that at the beginning of last month, Chen Baichuan, a cloth merchant in this city, entrusted the railway bureau to jointly transport eighteen pieces of cotton cloth to Xuzhou, intending to transfer them to the Longhai Railway to transport them to Shaanxi. After the goods arrived in Xuzhou, they could not proceed due to the interruption of the Longhai Railway. Therefore, on the 22nd of the same month, he handed over the cotton cloth to the Xuzhou station for joint transportation back to Shanghai, which was transported southward by train No. 51, with Feng Lingbang of the Jinpu Railway Vehicle Section as the freight escort. After the train arrived in Shanghai on the 24th, the luggage room of the Shanghai North Station found that twelve pieces of cotton cloth were missing during the inventory. At that time, the freight escort Feng Zhenbang immediately said that the remaining twelve pieces could be loaded on the next train and issued a receipt stating "Twelve pieces of cotton cloth to be transported." Partial loading and transportation was a common occurrence, so the North Station luggage room did not suspect anything. , , The North Tong Station chief telegraphed the Xuzhou station to inquire and discovered that Feng Zhenbang had embezzled the goods. The two railway bureaus have now sent investigators Xiang Peiyu, and the Jinpu Railway sent investigators Sun Shuren and Li Guanghui, to conduct investigations in Beijing, Shanghai, and Xuzhou. It was learned yesterday that the case has already yielded clues, and that the goods were taken away from the Nanjing station by Feng in collusion with a Mr. Lei, an employee of the Xuzhou luggage room, who impersonated the owner and forged a "self-managed parcel ticket." Feng and Lei are now both on the run. However, the Jinpu Railway has always adopted a three-person joint guarantee system for employing employees, so the two employees who guaranteed Feng have been detained. . As for the twelve pieces of cotton cloth, they include one piece of Yuexin lady's fabric (26 pǐ), five pieces of American wool (26 pǐ each), two pieces of Guoguang wool (22 pǐ each), six pǐ of Guoguang wool, six pǐ of Meihua wool, ten pǐ of Jeep wool (combined into one piece), one piece of Jeep wool (20 pǐ), one piece of Yuanzhi tribute fabric (10 pǐ), and one piece of plaid fabric (30 pǐ). The above totals twelve pieces of cotton cloth (282 pǐ). It is said that the Jinpu Railway authorities will be responsible for compensating for the above losses first.

### American Bureau for Medical Aid to China, Future Main Goal: Training Medical Personnel

Fifty People Currently Being Trained, Ms. Stevens Discusses Mission of This Trip

[Report from Our Newspaper] Ms. Stevens, Director-General of the American Bureau for Medical Aid to China, arrived in Shanghai from the United States a week ago. Yesterday afternoon, she received reporters at the office of the bureau on Jiangxi Road. Ms. Stevens said: She did not prepare too many plans for this trip to China, but wanted to have more contact with leaders from all sectors of the Chinese medical community and the Chinese people to find out what difficulties China urgently needs and needs to be solved, and then discuss solutions together. Ms. Soong Mei-ling is the honorary chairman of the American Bureau for Medical Aid to China. During the war, the bureau used a large number of medical supplies and equipment to relieve the Chinese army. Now that the war is over, it will continue to serve the Chinese people in the future. Ms. Stevens also said that half of the staff at the New York headquarters of the bureau are Chinese, and this organization can also be said to be a Sino-US cooperative institution. At present, the supply of goods is not much, and its main purpose is to train Chinese medical talents. There are currently fifty Chinese people being trained in the United States, including experts, nurses, and researchers in various academic fields.

Ms. Stevens paid great attention to public health, saying: Wilkie once said in "One World": "Health is more important than everything." Ms. Stevens also told that she only flew 54 hours from the United States to China, which shows how easy it is for germs to spread. Ms. Stevens praised the cholera eradication campaign in this city, saying that this disease is extremely terrifying, and it is not easy to control it.

Ms. Stevens is scheduled to fly to Beiping today to inspect the penicillin production plant being prepared by the Anti-epidemic Committee of the Executive Yuan's Department of Health, which is scheduled to be established on Double Ten Day. Then she will transfer to Nanjing to Lanzhou to inspect the Lanzhou Nursing School, and then go to Guiyang, Kunming, Guangzhou and other places, and is scheduled to return to China in early November to report the results and plan work plans in preparation for large-scale operations in China next year.

### Scope of Business License Tax in This City to Be Revised

[Report from Our Newspaper] The issue of business license tax for various businesses in this city was recently discussed by Yan E'sheng, Secretary-General of the City Chamber of Commerce, and Gu Chunfan, Director of the Finance Bureau. The tax rate for each industry that should pay license tax is collected at a rate of five per thousand of the capital. If the capital is difficult to estimate or difficult to investigate, it was resolved by the municipal government meeting that it could be calculated and collected in accordance with the previous license fee rate. However, although the scope of collection has been approved and added by the Ministry of Finance, various industries have not yet obtained licenses and paid taxes. Recently, it has been heard that the central government will re-revise the previously promulgated tax law in the near future. At that time, the scope of business license collection in this city will naturally be revised accordingly.

### Wen Lanting Weakened by Illness During Trial, Answers Questions with Only a Few Words, Nods Frequently, Claims to Have Acted on Orders When Assuming Puppet Positions, One Cry of "Grandpa" Brings Forth Tears, Seated and Served Tea in Court, Closing Arguments Concluded, Sentencing on the 12th

[Report from Our Newspaper] The High Court held a collegiate panel hearing on the case of Wen Lanting, suspected of being a traitor, at 9:45 AM yesterday. The defendant was helped out of prison by a bailiff and answered questions in court (see photo taken by this newspaper), but only said a few words and did not say much more. Three lawyers, Jiang Yong, Zhu Fujiu, and Sha Yankai, defended him. The hearing ended at 11:10 AM, and the court ordered that the sentence be pronounced at 9:30 AM on the 12th of this month.

The defendant wore a blue silk long gown, with a white short shirt and trousers underneath, light brown gauze socks on his feet, white-soled black shoes, frameless glasses on his nose, and held a folding fan in his hand. His hair was gray and his beard was long to his chest. Due to old age and weakness, poor spirits, and illness, he was helped by two bailiffs and walked out of the Zhongzi Prison at 9:25 AM, followed by two forensic doctors. He first went to the waiting room to rest for a while. His grandson stepped forward to shake hands and greet him, and when he asked "Grandpa," and "How is your health?" The defendant was touched by the scene and felt full of sorrow, unable to answer. After a long time, he choked out the words "Good, good," and then waved his hand to signal him to leave. After his grandson wiped away his tears and sadly left the room, he took off his glasses, took out a handkerchief from his pocket, and wiped away his tears. His thin and wrinkled hands trembled constantly.

At 9:45 AM, Presiding Judge Liu Yugui, along with two judges Cao Jun and Qiu Huan, prosecutor Ye Yushao, and court clerk, arrived in court and took their seats. They immediately ordered the bailiffs to bring the defendant to court. He was still helped up by two people, with the forensic doctor attending on the side to prevent accidents. Presiding Judge Liu first asked the forensic doctor about the defendant's condition, and the answer was that he suffered from scrotal edema, athlete's foot, and heart disease. Presiding Judge Liu then ordered the bailiffs to place a chair next to the defendant's bar, and then poured a cup of tea, and after letting the defendant sit down, he began to inquire. First, he asked Wen Lanting, 77 years old, from Wujin, residing on West Aihams Road, and formerly a director of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, is that correct? The defendant nodded after each question and did not say much more. Presiding Judge Liu then asked prosecutor Ye Yushao to stand up and state the main points of the indictment, briefly stating: The defendant joined a puppet organization in 1942 and served as the chairman of the Supervisory Committee of the Puppet Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. In 1943, when the Puppet Business Control Association was established, he controlled and collected various materials on behalf of the enemy. The defendant served as the chairman of the Supervisory Committee of the association. In July 1944, he succeeded Tang Shoumin as the chairman of the board of directors, and also served as the chairman of the Puppet Cotton Control Association, buying cotton yarn on behalf of the enemy, and also served as the chairman of the Puppet Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association, soliciting air defense donations for the enemy and puppets to use. Therefore, a public prosecution was filed in accordance with the law.

Answering Questions with Nods One by One

Presiding Judge Liu immediately asked about the various puppet positions that the defendant had held over the years, according to the prosecutor's allegations. The defendant either answered with a nod, or said "Yes," or just answered with a "Yes." The court then asked: What do you have to say about holding these puppet positions? The defendant immediately stood up and said that he had three statements: (1) I do not admit to conspiring with the enemy to plot against this country, and I do not admit to being a traitor. (2) The puppet position affairs that I have held were ordered by the central government beforehand, and I always followed the will of the central government afterwards. (3) All the confessions and self-confessions I made to the Military Statistics Bureau of the Fulv Lili Road were due to environmental coercion, and should therefore be invalid. What I want to say now is all in the defense statement, please judge publicly. After he finished speaking, he sat down.

Heart Beating, Sick, Still Doesn't Speak

The court then asked: Is the defense the same as the statement? Answer: The same. Question: You do not admit the transcripts of the Military Statistics Bureau, now you may as well briefly tell the truth. Answer: Please forgive the court, I still won't speak, because my heart is beating badly, I am sick. At this point, defense lawyer Zhu Fushun stood up and said: The defendant had military intelligence contacts with Li Mingyang, the former acting chairman of Jiangsu Province, which was proven by Wu Shiyi of the Third War Zone when he came to court last time. Later, Wang Maogong succeeded Li Mingyang as the head of Jiangsu and continued to hire the defendant as an advisor, which was before the victory, and there is a letter of appointment to prove it. The court immediately showed the letter of appointment to the defendant and asked: Is it correct? Answer: Correct. Question: Huang Hanzhi testified in court last time that you had done many charitable undertakings, such as refugee shelters and wounded soldiers' hospitals, are they all correct? Answer: This is a matter of duty, yes. Question: Qi Zaiyu, who was engaged in underground work as a special agent in Shanghai during the occupation, and others testified in court last time that you had rescued them: Answer: Not just once.

Holding Puppet Positions Said to Have a Tacit Understanding

Question: The Central Statistics Bureau has an official letter to Attorney Jiang, proving that you have provided cover for underground workers, and also said that you contacted the Central Statistics Bureau in advance before taking up puppet positions, is there such a thing? Answer: Yes. I didn't dare to say it before, but now that they have come out and said it, I won't deny it, it's true. At this point, Attorney Zhu stood up again to supplement: It was not to establish contact, but to file a record in advance before taking up puppet positions. The court asked the defendant: Lao Jingshou, Xu Jiqiang, Yan Huiqing, and others have submitted statements to this court stating that you provided cover for work and passively did not cooperate with the enemy and puppets when you were in puppet positions, what about this? Answer: I don't know inside (referring to prison). Question: The court obtained the minutes of the Standing Committee meeting of the Puppet Business Control Association, which totaled 27 meetings from August 1944 to August 1945. There are records of purchase and distribution plans, all with your signature. Take a look, is it? After the defendant looked at it, he replied: Yes.

Doesn't Admit But Also Doesn't Deny

The court then asked: This court also has the Puppet New China Daily and the Puppet Shen Bao. When you were the chairman of the Puppet Business Control Association, you made speeches at the "Greater East Asia War Anniversary" and the "National Government's Return to the Capital Anniversary" meetings. What do you have to say about this? Answer: I cannot admit or deny this. If the newspaper wants to publish it, I can't tell them not to publish it. But it is a fact that I don't talk much usually. Then, Attorney Zhu presented a certificate from Xu Caicheng to the court, stating: The defendant took office as the chairman of the Puppet Business Control Association on July 1, 1944, but in May and June, he was ordered by the Central Statistics Bureau to step up the prevention of control, and Xu Caicheng directly telegraphed the chairman on June 22.

Prosecutor Ye Stood Up to Accuse

At this point, Presiding Judge Liu said that the case was very clear and began the arguments, first asking the prosecutor to accuse. Prosecutor Ye immediately stood up and stated: The Puppet National Commercial Control Association was the highest institution for the enemy to control materials in our country. The defendant successively served as the chairman of the Supervisory Committee and the chairman of the board of directors of the association, and also served as the chairman of the Puppet Cotton Yarn Control Association, collecting materials on behalf of the enemy. According to the investigation, the puppet Executive Yuan once ordered the Puppet Business Control Association to purchase 2 million dan of military rice and more than 50,000 pieces of cotton yarn successively. The defendant also served as the chairman of the Puppet Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association, raising 100,000,000 puppet currency for air defense donations, and repeatedly made pro-enemy remarks. He is undoubtedly willing to be an accomplice and should be punished by the court with the punishment he deserves.

Defense Lawyers Responded Separately

The court then asked the defendant's defense lawyers to respond. Lawyers Jiang Yong, Zhu Fushun, and Sha Yankai responded one by one on the three points of legal facts and right and wrong. They said in brief: The Shanghai people all know the defendant in this case. He has been upright and very selfless throughout his life. For decades, he has assisted the revolution and served the society. It can be said that he has completely worked for the public and not for himself. Because of his uprightness, the defendant is unwilling to speak out about the beneficial things he has done for others. The people who came to court last time to provide favorable evidence for the defendant all came voluntarily and were not based on the defendant's own claims or requests. The defendant took up a puppet position under the order of the central government, and is now not understood by the outside world and has been deeply stimulated. Therefore, although there is various favorable evidence, the defendant is unwilling to say more. He didn't say anything when he was questioned by the Military Statistics Bureau last year. The transcripts of the bureau are full of contradictions, and the self-confession was written by someone else. All the confessions, self-confessions, and transcripts of the defendant in the Military Statistics Bureau are completely not his own meaning, so they cannot be admitted. Qi Zai Wang and Wu Shiyi of the Third War Zone of the Military Statistics Bureau have testified in court last time that they had been rescued by the defendant. In fact, there are too many underground workers who have been rescued by the defendant, there are one or two hundred on the surface, and thousands indirectly. Zhang Shutong, the father of martyr Zhang Xiaotong, was also protected by the defendant, and the defendant himself was interrogated by the enemy gendarmerie because of this, and was forced to confess Zhang's address, but he never said it. If it is said that the defendant conspired with the enemy, then why didn't he tell the enemy gendarmerie at that time? The defendant handled affairs in Shanghai under the order of the central government, and any group puppet position he participated in was filed in advance. When Li Mingyang was the acting chairman of Jiangsu Province, the radio station of his Shanghai office was located in the defendant's home. Therefore, Wang Maogong continued to hire the defendant as an advisor when he became the head of Jiangsu. On July 1, 1944, the defendant took office as the chairman of the Puppet Business Control Association and was ordered in advance to find ways to prevent commercial control. The purchase of yarn and cloth was in 1943, when the defendant was still the chairman of the Supervisory Committee and was not responsible for the actual responsibility, and this matter was not purchased by the Puppet Cotton Control Association, but was responsible by the yarn and cloth purchase office under the Puppet Business Control Association. As for the statement that 2 million dan of rice were supplied to the enemy, this was a matter of the Puppet Rice Control Association, and these 1 million or 2 million dan were all empty words and there was no evidence. As for air defense donations, because most of the dead in air raids were Chinese, they were used to relieve the victims, and were not used to make anti-aircraft guns or planes to fight against the allied aircraft. Participating in various "commemorative meetings" and making speeches may have been inaccurate records, and the defendant had the capital to provide cover. If he did not participate, he would not be able to provide cover. In February 1945, Xie Chengxun, the administrative commissioner and security commander of the third district of Jiangsu, came to Shanghai to contact Ren Yuandao, Zhou Fohai, and others to defect, and the defendant also participated in it. Now that Ren Yuandao, who listened to it afterwards, is a dignified government official, while Wen Lanting, who is responsible for the counter-insurgency, has to bear the crime. This matter is still requested to be studied by the court. In short, the defendant does whatever is beneficial to the people, and absolutely does not do anything that is not beneficial to the people. Whether speaking from a behavioral or legal point of view, the defendant did not use the power of the enemy and puppets to act in a way that was detrimental to this country, but used the power of the enemy and puppets to act in a way that was beneficial to this country. Therefore, he cannot be called conspiring with the enemy to plot against this country, but should be called conspiring with this country to plot against the enemy. The defendant is a traitor to the enemy country, a traitor to the puppet government, not a traitor to this country. Now it is not a question of fact, not a question of law, but a question of right and wrong. Please the court distinguish between right and wrong and give the defendant a verdict of not guilty.

Nodding, Waving, Sad Farewell

After the arguments ended, the court asked the defendant again: Do you have anything else to say? He replied: I have nothing to say, please the court judge publicly. Presiding Judge Liu immediately announced that the verdict in this case was scheduled to be announced at 9:30 AM on the 12th of this month, and then adjourned the court. It was 11:10 AM. The defendant stood up, nodded and waved goodbye to his family and friends sadly, and was still helped back to the Zhongzi Prison by the bailiffs.

### Living Expenses for Families of Traitors, High Court Has Decided on Implementation Measures

[Report from Our Newspaper] After the victory, the courts in various places ruled that all the property of traitors would be confiscated except for the necessary living expenses for their families. How the two words "necessary" should be interpreted has not been clearly stipulated by the authorities. For this reason, the courts in Anhui and other places have requested an explanation from the Ministry of Judicial Administration, but no response has been heard so far. It is learned that the Shanghai High Court has determined a method for this, that is, after the confiscated property of the traitor is auctioned, a part of it will be allocated to the family according to the general ordinary living conditions in the society. This matter is now being implemented by the High Prosecutor's Office.

### Too Many Maritime Agencies, Many Maritime Security Problems

[Report from Our Newspaper] Recently, the "scalpers" on the Huangpu River have been extremely active, causing great suffering to travelers. The biggest problem with the poor security situation on the river is actually due to the fact that there are too many parallel agencies and their powers have not been unified. It is reported that there are as many as six agencies responsible for maintaining security in the 40-li stretch of water in the city, namely (1) the Maritime Police Sub-bureau, (2) the Port Police, (3) the Maritime Inspection Office of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, (4) the Military Police Regiment, (5) the "Executive Yuan" Security Group, and (6) the petition police used by the "Executive Yuan." Mayor Wu recently convened relevant parties to discuss improvement measures, but no concrete results were obtained. A senior official of the police bureau told reporters yesterday that to improve maritime security, it would be best to merge these six units, which would unify their powers and save expenses. At present, there are only more than 130 on-duty personnel in the Maritime Police Sub-bureau, divided into three shifts, so at most 30 police officers are dispatched at ordinary times, which is naturally not enough. If a new and expanded organization can be established and criminal and foreign affairs police are added to be responsible for investigating bandits and opium and inspecting passengers' passports, it is believed that the maritime security situation can be greatly improved.

### Shipping Industry Prepares to Organize Dock Warehouse Company

More than 40 representatives of various shipping companies in this city yesterday welcomed Wang Shixiang, the newly appointed director of the Shanghai Dock Warehouse Management Office, and relevant personnel from the Public Utilities Bureau at the Bank Club.

As a result, it was resolved that the government and various shipping companies would jointly establish a dock warehouse company to actively supplement and repair the equipment of each dock and warehouse, and strengthen the dredging and digging work. The planned capital is 5 billion yuan.

### City Government Burglary

[Report from Our Newspaper] Room No. 199 on the second floor of the Municipal Government Building, in which dozens of pǐ of artificial silk fabrics and other materials seized from the enemy and puppets were piled up, was burglarized at around 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, after the staff left the office. At 9:00 PM that night, four pǐ of miscellaneous artificial silk fabrics were suddenly stolen. The responsible personnel discovered this and reported it to the police station for investigation.

### Charity Sale of National Goods: Nitric Acid Accidentally Splashes on Two Young Girls

[Report from this newspaper] The charity sale of national goods for educational purposes, held at the Sino-French School, was on its last day yesterday. Shanghai Girls' High School student Ying Suqiu (17 years old), accompanied by her neighbor Ma Suqin (13 years old), went to the school to shop at 4 PM. They were standing at the stationery charity sale booth when Shen Jiadong, an employee of the Shanghai Machine Factory, bought a bottle of "nitric acid" and stood behind the two girls to watch the excitement. Accidentally, drops of acid leaked from the bottle and splashed on the legs of Ying and Ma. They immediately cried out in pain and fell to the ground. After the incident, the police officers stationed there sent the two girls to Nanyang Hospital for treatment and detained the perpetrator for interrogation.

While the drug trafficking case is indeed a fact, and the suspects have long been transferred by the Songhu Garrison Command to the District Prosecutor's Office for handling, the claim of "air transport of drugs" and "landing at Dacha Airport" has been found to be incorrect after further inquiry by our newspaper with relevant parties. The case was indeed cracked by the Water Patrol Division of the Inspection Office of the Songhu Garrison Command, but it was not air transport, nor did it land at Dacha Airport. We hereby request that you make the necessary corrections. Sincerely, Continental News Agency.

### Shanghai Journalists Association Warmly Welcomes Professor Pei Fei

Professor Pei Fei has studied international issues for decades and has a deep understanding of the global situation. Since the end of the war, China has been turbulent and unable to achieve peace and unity. However, we sincerely believe that the stability of China is the stability of the Far East, and only when the Far East is stable can world stability be ensured. In this turbulent world and unstable political situation, the work of journalists is extremely arduous and difficult. Professor Pei has profound research on various issues, so we ask Professor Pei for guidance. Professor Pei modestly replied that he agreed with what was said, but he did not have much to offer. He acknowledged that journalism is an arduous task, especially in a turbulent world and a troubled China. He expressed his respect and sympathy for journalists, believing that journalism and striving for peace are equally difficult tasks. Freedom of the press is the freedom of the nation, so we should always fight for freedom of the press. Over the decades, Chinese journalism has been constantly progressing, and he wished the press continuous struggle for justice. Professor Pei's brief but heartfelt words were met with applause.

### Gauze Smuggling Issue, Export Management Not Ordered, South China's Yarn Allocation Reaches 80%, 4,000 Pieces of Allocated Yarn Unshipped

[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday, this reporter visited Wu Weijing, deputy general manager of China Textile Construction Company, to inquire about the actual situation of gauze smuggling from South China. According to him, although gauze smuggling is often heard of, it is impossible to state the actual situation due to the inability to accurately quantify it. However, recently the gauze market in various parts of Vietnam has been heated, with 20-count yarn reaching 3 million legal currency per piece, and ordinary bleached cloth reaching over 120,000 legal currency per bolt. Where there is profit, smuggling is inevitable. Moreover, the applications for yarn allocation from various yarn factories to the joint distribution agencies for export to South China account for 80% of the total. It seems that the demand for yarn in South China's processing industry is not so large. The surplus is inevitably flowing to various parts of Southeast Asia through Hong Kong, Macau, and other places. The Textile Business Management Committee has drafted management measures for this matter, but has not yet received instructions from the Executive Yuan. According to Mr. Wu's opinion, the management of gauze exports should be somewhat flexible. The feasibility of exporting should be determined based on the actual domestic supply and demand for gauze. For example, if yarn is a raw material and domestic demand is urgent, there is no need to consider exporting it at present. However, among the finished fabrics, colored fabrics are the most popular in Southeast Asia. If there is a surplus in this city, it may be worth considering exporting some to maintain the domestic printing and dyeing industry and the livelihoods of its employees. As for the supply of cotton yarn in this city, there is actually more than enough. As far as Textile Construction is concerned, there are currently more than 4,000 pieces of allocated cotton yarn that have not yet been claimed by customers. Among them, there are more than 800 pieces of fine yarn. It can be seen that the need for cotton yarn in this city is not as urgent as commonly believed.

### Market Trading is Sluggish, Black Market Prices for "Double Horse" Drop Again

The market price of gauze is slightly higher than yesterday. Fine "Dragon Head" cloth was traded at 64,500 yuan, "Wah Gee" at 60,000 yuan, and other goods were traded very little. Textile Construction's opening price remained the same, and fewer factories came to purchase than in the previous session. In the yarn market, "Double Horse" opened at 1.5 million, then fell to 1.412 million, and miscellaneous brands also retreated to around 1.3 million. Except for the popular 42-count "Blue Phoenix," which remained at 2.14 million, other 42-count "Shi Guang" only traded at 2.08 million, and there were few transactions. As for 32-count "Xiantao" cones, there were no inquiries. The reason for the weakness is that the festival season is approaching and credit is tightening. In addition, the Cantonese gang, which usually absorbs a large amount, has also been restricted, which has a significant impact on the market. According to people in the industry, the Cantonese gang has recently remitted a large amount of funds again, and many companies have applied to the Customs Administration for export. In the future, some gauze may be approved for shipment to the south, but the expected time will be after the festival.

It is also reported that the Textile Construction Company has stopped accepting registration cards for application registrations from various factories. At the same time, it is also carefully reviewing and reorganizing those who have already been registered and approved to receive goods. The qualification for opening goods for vendors and out-of-town customers is also being re-evaluated, while manufacturers are investigated for their production capacity in order to determine the standard for opening goods, so that those who open goods can get what they need and market prices can be stabilized, it was said.

### Large Quantities of Cotton Cloth Shipped to Guangdong

Reportedly Due To Customs Announcement of Prior Registration [Reported by This Newspaper] China Merchants' "Peide" ship sailed to Guangdong today, carrying 6,500 pieces of cotton cloth. "Jiang Qing" ship sailed to Chongqing this morning, loaded with more than 610 pieces of cotton for shipment to Chongqing. According to shipping industry news yesterday, Customs issued a notice yesterday prohibiting the shipment of cotton yarn and cotton cloth to South China, including the seven ports of Guangdong, Shantou, Xiamen, and Fuzhou. According to South China merchants, the Customs announcement yesterday prohibiting the export of cotton yarn and cotton cloth to South China does not hinder merchants. The purpose of the ban is to stop smuggling. Since the Customs' No. 25 announcement on January 19 of this year, prohibiting the export of cotton yarn and cotton cloth to foreign countries, smuggling out of Guangzhou has gradually increased, resulting in a continuous large amount of cotton yarn and cotton cloth being shipped from this city to the south, and prices have gradually increased accordingly. It is also understood that smuggling is speculative and is done by people with evil forces. Legitimate merchants can still apply to the customs at the destination, and if they obtain a certificate, they can still purchase and transport goods, but the procedures are slightly more troublesome. As for the cotton cloth shipped to Guangdong by the "Peide" ship today, it was registered before the Customs announcement, so it can be shipped out.

### Gold and Paper Money Change from Stable to Weak

"Xia Chi" reported to downstream yesterday that it opened in the morning at around 2.05 million. The high price was once called 2.06 million.

It fell to a low price of 1.78 million in the middle of the day, and then short covering maintained it.

The Securities Exchange temporarily did not auction unified bonds, and people's hearts were unsettled.

Foreign currencies changed from stable to weak. The US dollar gradually declined from a selling price of 3,300 yuan. The gold market was heavily weak. It fell to around 3,240 yuan near noon before slightly rebounding. In the afternoon, it followed the gold market and rebounded, finally closing near the 3,300 yuan level, resulting in a similar closing to the previous day. Hong Kong dollars changed from flat to weak, and the low price once fell to around 670 yuan, and then stabilized slightly, resulting in a drop of 10 yuan compared to the previous closing. The Hong Kong exchange rate was affected by the suspension of Da Heng, and operators were concerned. Buyers waited and watched, retreating to 680 yuan to 690 yuan. Indian exchange was 840 yuan, British exchange was 11,250 yuan, and the quoted price of the US exchange rate showed a shortage of supply.

[Reuters Hong Kong, 4th] Today, the Hong Kong exchange rate opened at 14.5 Hong Kong dollars to 10,000 legal currency.

### Bulls Shift Direction Upon Seeing Wind, Unified Bonds Decline

The public bond bulls finally gave way. Unified C bonds opened in the morning and had already fallen to 2,200 yuan. At the high price of 2,260 yuan, they were killed by the bulls and gradually moved downstream. The 2,000 yuan level was soon broken. It fell to a low price of 1.78 million in the middle of the day, and then short covering maintained it. It struggled at around 1.85 million at closing, resulting in a drop of 570,000 compared to the previous closing. A and B fell by 250,000, Type D fell by 350,000, and Type E also fell by 300,000. The Securities Exchange temporarily did not auction unified bonds, and people's hearts were unsettled.

Yesterday, it was learned that the bank had suspended collection at its Shanghai branch starting yesterday, continued to pay out normally, and implemented liquidation. At the same time, it listed various facts and petitioned the Ministry of Finance to withdraw the order. Dong Ganwen, the manager of the bank, made a statement, claiming that: This firm was established in Hong Kong in the tenth year of the Republic of China, specializing in agency remittance business for overseas Chinese. It applied to the Central Bank to be a designated bank, but did not receive a reply. However, this firm holds a large amount of Hong Kong exchange in its affiliated firms in Hong Kong, and remits them to the country at any time. It entrusts this firm purely as an agent and does not engage in private operations. According to statistics, the foreign exchange sold by this firm is limited to the purchase of ships, machinery, cotton, pigments, and industrial raw materials, except for a small amount of private living expenses. Therefore, the operation of foreign exchange by this bank not only has no intention of disrupting finance, but also greatly benefits the national economy and the people's livelihood. Looking back in the past, whenever the market's foreign exchange fluctuated excessively, this firm would release a large amount of foreign exchange for sale to meet the needs of legitimate importers, and the foreign exchange market price would often be suppressed as a result. If overseas Chinese hold foreign exchange and there is no firm to channel and release it, it will flow into the hands of speculators, and the harm to Yu Rong will be even more unimaginable. In addition to petitioning for the withdrawal of the order, the Shanghai branch will be temporarily liquidated to comply with the law.

### Rayon Prices Rise Sharply

Yesterday, the rayon Textile Construction Company did not list prices and will open sales today. Therefore, the black market price rose sharply again. 120-count "Tian Qiao You Guang" was called 2.45 million in the morning, and raised further to 600,000 in the afternoon, with the highest being 650,000, an increase of more than 100,000 yuan compared to the previous day. However, the price increase was too high, and few transactions were made. In the afternoon, miscellaneous brand 120-count "You Guang" was traded at 565,000, and "Guang" at 2.05 million, with the former being about 200,000 yuan higher than the previous day, and the latter being 150,000 yuan higher. Factory prices were stable because of tight credit. There was no power to rise. The selling price of seasonal silk goods increased slightly. For example, the selling prices of "Minsheng" Xin Yan Jin and Qiu Si Zhou increased by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, Hua Jin Zhou increased by 100 yuan, and the rest were firm.

### Japonica and Indica Rice Rebound, Oil Prices Plummet

The rice market was connected to both suppliers and consumers. New japonica rice was still scarce, and white rice was still lacking. There was little old japonica rice. Shops were still eager to accept it. Indica rice rebounded by more than 1,000 yuan, and white rice remained firm. The situation of new japonica rice was tight, and old japonica rice was deserted. Old jian rice was also gradually declining, and new goods were the majority. The retail sales of flour were sluggish, falling by 100 yuan. Wheat from Fujian and Yong were active but not strong. There were few transactions, slightly down by 300 to 500 yuan. Northern white wheat was also less intake.

The supply of soybeans exceeded demand. The price of new lower and medium-grade beans continued to fall by 500 to 600 yuan. The price of old beans was flat due to scarcity. The supply of broad beans from various sources was strong, especially the selected green goods from Zhejiang Province, which fell sharply by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, and there were still few transactions. The price of raw peanuts from the Cantonese gang did not move and the local market was watching, falling sharply by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan, and it still felt sluggish. The price of bran fell slightly by 100 to 200 yuan. The supply of oil to the market was slightly more. If the goods were good, they could attract distant customers. Shops were hesitant to take stock and had no intention of purchasing, and market prices fell sharply by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan and it was still difficult to stand firm.

### Sugar Prices Fall Again

Yesterday, the sugar market continued to soften, and actual sales were also watching and did little. The price of medium white sugar continued to fall by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan, gradually approaching the par value. In the afternoon, the Taiwan Sugar Company opened a batch of medium white sugar to various sugar firms in Taiwan at a par value of 140,000 yuan. The exact quantity is not yet suitable to be announced. Only scattered transactions were made for goods of different brands, including Shantou Chongtiqing at 128,000 yuan for 50 bags, Xinghua white at 165,000 yuan, and Xinghua red at 136,700 yuan, all down by a few thousand yuan.

### About 5,000 Loads of Autumn Cocoons, Loans Still Under Negotiation

The autumn cocoon maturation period will arrive in two weeks. Various manufacturers have not yet settled the spring silk advance payment, so the current urgent task is not only the autumn cocoon loan issue. If the purchase of raw silk is based on a uniform D-grade quality of 78 points and 2-3 stripes, the value is estimated at 3.8 million yuan per load, which is about 40 billion yuan. According to silk industry sources, the purchase price of dry cocoons is 2.2 million yuan per load, the reeling cost is 1 million yuan, and the interest is about 600,000 yuan, plus insurance management fees, which is a considerable amount. If purchases are made early, consumption and losses can be reduced. The autumn cocoon loan issue is being actively promoted by all parties. Representatives from relevant parties are discussing and stipulating the number of cocoon banks to be purchased, loans, distribution, reduction of consumption, and pricing. It is also learned that it is estimated that 5,000 loads of autumn cocoons can be harvested, and the estimated loan is 150 million yuan, and the reeling cost is about 5 billion yuan. Manufacturers are responsible for the purchase, and the China Silk Company provides guidance.

### Festival Season Approaches, Credit Tightens, Securities Black Market Sluggish

The Shanghai stock market was sluggish, and all stocks fell in unison, especially small and unpopular stocks. In the early morning, they were still stable. The high prices were 648 yuan for Yongsha, 3,850 yuan for Meiya, 255 yuan for Jingfu, 275 yuan for Xinguang, and 195 yuan for Qinyu. Soon, they gradually turned weak and eventually fell under the lack of support and pressure from tight credit. However, Meiya was still relatively stable. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yongsha and Meiya fell slightly, and Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing fell by about half a percentage point. The prices of smaller mid-sized stocks also fell slightly by about half a percentage point. Old stocks showed a slight rebound.

Securities dealers in foreign stocks, in view of the news that foreign stocks would not be listed, continued to close out positions. As a result, the popular large stocks continued to move downstream, while the small stocks were more stable. Old bulls and Western merchants added to their positions at low prices, which provided support, and the situation was mediocre. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yisha and Yinglian fell by half a percentage point, Yeguang was flat, and the rest fell but not much.

### Japanese Goods Can Arrive Next Week, China Trust Will Sell in Batches

The quantity of rayon we ordered from Japan is extremely large. According to He Molin, manager of the barter department of the China Trust Bureau, the first batch of orders will arrive next week. In order to avoid severe fluctuations in the market, it was decided to sell them in batches and directly allocate them to silk weaving factories, rather than buying and selling in the market. Local factories in this city entrust the China Textile Company to allocate them, and the out-of-town factories are directly distributed by the Wood Bureau. It is expected that rayon, which is currently rising sharply, will tend to stabilize.

### Banking Industry Ordered to Extend Business Hours

From 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM

The business hours of banks and money shops in this city have always been from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM. Recently, the Ministry of Finance ordered that the afternoon hours be changed to 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM. After receiving the order, the banks and money shops have extended their hours by one hour starting on the 4th.

### Tianjin Central Branch Plans to Directly Handle Foreign Exchange

[Tianjin, 4th] Bian Xisun, manager of the Tianjin branch of the Central Bank, said that when foreign exchange was first opened, foreign trade had not yet returned to normal, so only the Shanghai head office was allowed to settle foreign exchange. In the future, foreign trade in various places will become more frequent, especially in Tianjin, which is more important. In order to facilitate import and export merchants, it has been approved by the head office to establish a foreign exchange department in the Tianjin branch, and recently requested the head office to allow the bank to directly settle foreign exchange with foreign countries. If approved, trade merchants and designated banks will be greatly facilitated.

### Business Tax Will Still Be Collected at the Current Tax Rate, Classification by Industry Will Be Discussed When Amending the Law

[Reported by this newspaper] Previously, the City Chamber of Commerce, based on the suggestions of various trade associations regarding the collection of business tax by industry classification, presented reasons on July 13 and telegraphed the Ministry of Finance for approval. The Chamber of Commerce now received a reply from the Ministry of Finance on August 29 stating: "The telegram is understood. In order to consider the difficulties of merchants, the Ministry has already halved the current business tax rate. The request to determine the tax level by industry classification is acceptable and should be reserved for reference when the business tax law is amended in the future. Before the amendment, we should still be mindful of the current difficulties and strive to pay taxes according to the current tax rate in order to prioritize national taxes." The Chamber of Commerce's standing record approval was sent to various trade associations for reference a few days ago.

### Grain Transshipment Restrictions Extended for Two Months

The Executive Yuan recently instructed Bai Licha, Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs, to extend the previously stipulated restrictions on the transshipment of rice and grains reported from Shanghai for two months, until the end of October, in order to continue to stabilize the food supply in Shanghai.

### With Shipping Dates Approaching, Tea for Export is Active

The foreign tea market has seen increasing buying activity from export companies due to the approaching shipping dates, and market conditions continue to improve. Chen Chouzhen, obtained 86 boxes from the China-South Tea Factory through the Xinhua Tea Company, creating a peak of 74,000 yuan per load, an increase of 4,000 yuan compared to the previous crush. Other companies such as Xiehe, Tongfu, Wu Chang, Zhu Yutai, and Hua Tea had substantial participation in Chen Zhenmei, Qimen Black Tea, and Fujian Xiaozhong. As for the B.O.P. marked Taiwanese fine black tea that Indian companies want to purchase, according to news from the production area, the price has recently risen to NT$4,000 per load, plus freight and other expenses, which would be at least 130,000 yuan in legal currency per load in this city. Under these circumstances, it may be difficult to sell smoothly for a while.

### Chiang Chairman's Hometown

— Our Newspaper, Fenghua Dispatch on the 22nd, Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng

Natural environments can influence a person's temperament and learning; the growth of a person is undoubtedly greatly related to the place where they grow up. For example, when we were in Shaoxing, we felt an environment of profound simplicity, purity, and perseverance, which is why we have the story of King Goujian of Yue. Also, when we were in Yuyao, we felt the beauty of the rivers and mountains and the pleasant scenery, which is why we have such virtuous predecessors as Yan Ziling, Wang Yangming, Zhu Shunshui, and Huang Lizhou. We are in Ningbo, which is indeed a transportation hub; therefore, commerce is thriving, and most people make a living by doing business. Fenghua, adjacent to Ningbo, is the hometown of Chiang Chairman of our National Government. Our respect for this great figure naturally makes us think of the natural environment of his hometown.

On the third day after arriving in Ningbo, we went to Fenghua. There were many stones on the road, and it was not very smooth. After crossing the Jiangkou Bridge, which is the only new construction project of the Ministry of Transportation on this highway, we arrived at Fenghua City.

Fenghua has an area of more than five thousand square li, with more than three hundred thousand mu of arable land and a population of two hundred and thirty thousand people. Here, there are two county-run Fenghua middle schools, namely, Taiqing middle school, and elementary schools such as Jinxi elementary school. Fenghua middle school was founded during the Guangxu period of the late Qing Dynasty, originally named Fenglu middle school, and was where Chairman Chiang studied in his youth. When we arrived at Fenghua middle school, we saw that the windows and other parts had been damaged, and it was very dilapidated. Local people are planning to revive the school. Jinxi elementary school was originally Jinxi academy, later changed to elementary school, and Chairman Chiang also graduated from this school.

Fenghua County is not very big. There is a large bridge about three li away from the city, connecting Ninghai, Ningbo, and other places, so commerce is more prosperous than in Fenghua City.

The county seat is built against the mountain, and Phoenix Mountain does resemble a phoenix.

Fenghua County is built against Phoenix Mountain, and Phoenix Mountain does resemble a phoenix. Local people say that "Fenghua" was originally called "Fenghua," with the mountain resembling a phoenix and the county seat resembling a flower. During the Song Dynasty, talented people emerged in large numbers, and the academic atmosphere was also strong. During the Yuan Dynasty, a county magistrate, out of jealousy of Fenghua's culture, ordered the county residents to temporarily relocate and rebuilt the county seat into the shape of a large knife. At the phoenix head of the county seat, he specially nailed dozens of wooden stakes and long iron nails. From then on, Fenghua had no famous people. During the Qing Dynasty, if a county resident became the county magistrate, he was respected by the entire county. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, before the revolution, Mr. Zhou Rixuan, a revolutionary predecessor, removed all the wooden stakes and nails. As a result, Fenghua entered an era of talented people again. This is just a story circulating among the people of Fenghua, but the fact that Phoenix Mountain resembles a phoenix is indeed true. Now, the late Mr. Zhou Rixuan is buried next to the Confucian temple. Mr. Zhou was one of the people admired by Chairman Chiang, so Chairman Chiang funded the construction of his tomb.

Many of the buildings in Fenghua City have also been destroyed. The county territory has Siming Mountain, so it is not very peaceful. The only task now is how to stabilize order and revive construction.

The road from Fenghua City to Xikou in the county is also not very smooth. There are several wooden bridges among them, which are in danger of collapsing. We are worried that if Chairman Chiang returns to his hometown, it will make him feel the hardship of a journey after his hard work.

Mentioning Wenchang Pavilion, there are still lingering fears and shocks.

We have arrived at Xikou. After moving forward dozens of steps, we arrived at Wuling Gate. The magnificent buildings inside the gate are Wuling Hospital and Wuling School. In front of the school is a mound with Wenchang Pavilion on it. Next to the pavilion, there was originally a modern residential building, which was where Chairman Chiang stayed, but it has been bombed by the enemy and no longer exists. It is said that at that time, the enemy obtained intelligence that Chairman Chiang had returned to his hometown and was living in this house, so they launched heavy bombers to bomb it fiercely. Therefore, the people of Xikou still have lingering fears and anger when they mention the bombing of Wenchang Pavilion. Climbing Wenchang Pavilion, you can see the stream winding from afar to its feet.

Wuling School was damaged, but now it has been repaired.

Wuling School has junior high and elementary schools. This year, a high school has been added, with more than seven hundred students. Students in Xikou do not have to pay for their education; everything is free. The school has a hospital, a training field, a forest farm, and a canning factory. Chairman Chiang himself concurrently serves as the school director. Mr. Shi Jiyan is the principal, and there are more than thirty faculty members. Mr. Shi said: "When it was recovered, Wuling School was so devastated that it was unbearable to look at. Everything now has been recently repaired." I asked how much the monthly expenses were, and he said, "It's not too much because Chairman Chiang himself is also poor!" The architecture of the school building is a mix of Chinese and Western styles, with Chinese-style roofs and Western-style buildings. Many of the interior decorations are antique. Mr. Shi also said: "When this school was founded, it began to operate a farm. Now, the farm's products are almost self-sufficient. Vegetables in Xikou were originally very expensive. For example, vegetables that cost more than two hundred yuan per catty on the market now cost us only seventy yuan per catty."

The stream in Xikou is called Yanxi, originating from Sheng County. Sheng County originates from Dongyang, Tiantai, and Wuyi counties. Yanxi flows through Xikou and is also called Jinxi. Most of the stream bed is exposed, with many pebbles, and only small boats can twist and turn through it. I still remember the poem of the ancients: "Wearing a bay, rushing through the rapids, a single sail passes, resting my head and chanting softly to Yan." But it is completely different. Mr. Shen Chengzhang pointed to the stream in front of me and told me, "When I came here in the 25th year of the Republic (1936), bamboo rafts were following each other in this stream, but now it has gradually dried up, so Xikou must pay attention to water conservancy." He also said, "In the 25th year of the Republic, I came here with Mr. Xu Yuanquan, stayed at Wuling School, ate at Chairman Chiang's house, and visited famous scenic spots all day."

The old house is simple and unadorned; workers are hired to nail and decorate.

From Wuling School, a small road built of cement leads up, which is exceptionally flat. A row of cement pillars and poles, built along the river, about one hundred yards, is the main street. The buildings on both sides of the street, which are not very tall, have some small shops, a telegraph office, and a post office. Passing the Chiang family ancestral hall, there is a plaque in front of the door that reads: "Loyalty and Filial Piety Passed Down Through Generations," written by Chairman Chiang. Further ahead is the old house, which is not luxurious but very simple. Passing through the round door of the white powder wall, there are two words "Su Ju" (Simple Residence) written on the door. Inside are several courtyards of Chinese-style houses, with a hall in the middle where the shrines are placed. The portrait of Chiang's mother, Madam Wang, is placed in the middle, with several chairs and tables inlaid with marble on both sides. Turning inside, there are six modern houses, which are also very ordinary. All the houses have been greatly damaged by the enemy. Now, two or three workers have been hired to nail and install.

The birds in the pine forest chirp and sing the praises of Chiang's mother's achievements.

Walking two kilometers to the foot of Yulin'ao, climbing the steps, the ground is full of green, and the pine forest is dense. A few birds chirping can be heard from the bushes, which is praising Chiang's mother's achievements. Climbing three li to Chiang's mother's tomb hut. Entering the door, there is a plaque with the words "Ci An" (Kind Hermitage), written by Tan Yankai. Behind it is a pavilion with a stone tablet in the middle, inscribed with the text of the national father's memorial to Chiang's mother. Behind the tablet is inscribed Chairman Chiang's account of his mother's deeds, written by Yu Youren. There are six stone tablets on both walls, all of which are texts praising Chairman Chiang by the Kuomintang of the National Government of China. Connecting to the two sides of the tablet pavilion, the right side is Chairman Chiang's bedroom, with a sofa chair and a round tea table. The bed is placed on the right middle side of the entrance, with a table next to the bed, and a dressing table on the right side, with a long oval mirror. Under the mirror is a porcelain white horse, with a lifelike posture. Opposite the dressing table, there is a wardrobe with a white porcelain goose on it. On the left end, there is a fireplace. According to Mr. Jiang Guoquan, who went with us, "This fireplace is for burning firewood." To the left of the fireplace, there are two washrooms and toilets.

The room on the left side of the tablet pavilion is a reception room, with sofas, tables, and chairs inside.

The stone tablet was damaged by the enemy; Miaogao Terrace was even more tragic.

Further to the left, there are four or five bungalows, presumably for kitchens and other uses. The curtains in each room are made of cloth. According to Mr. Jiang Lixiang, who went with us, "When it was recovered, the stone tablet was damaged by the enemy, and the chairman's bedroom was used as a stable by the enemy. The houses were so badly damaged that they were uninhabitable. Now they have all been recently repaired, and the chairman has not seen them yet!" I asked where Chairman Chiang usually lived when he came to Xikou. He said, "There are also a few small houses on Miaogao Terrace, where the chairman lives when he travels in the mountains. Although he sometimes lives in Wenchang Pavilion, it is not for long. The place where he lives the most is of course here." I also asked about the extent of the damage to the houses on Miaogao Terrace. He said, "The damage is even worse. Now it has also been newly repaired. The chairman has not seen all the equipment, and I don't know if he is satisfied?"

Following the mountain path, we reached Chiang's mother's tomb. The national father's handwriting "Chiang's Mother's Tomb" is inscribed on the stone tablet. We paid our respects and lingered for a long time. We saw that a mountain range in front of us was like a screen. Under the range, there were hundreds of thousands of acres of fertile land. Looking into the distance, the mountains on all sides were majestic and elegant, magnificent and grand. It is still twenty-five li to Miaogao Terrace and Xuebao Temple. Miaogao Terrace is located on Siming Mountain, with tall and verdant pine forests and fragrant wildflowers. The chairman's residence is built there, which is also a very simple and plain two-story building with eight rooms. Three li across from it is Xuesi Temple. Mr. Yu Jimin, who accompanied me, told me: "In the past, the monks in the temple often treated guests poorly. In the 25th year of the Republic (1936), the former chairman, Mr. Lin Sen, came here with a simple entourage and was also treated poorly. Therefore, Mr. Zeng Yangfu and others built houses fifty meters away from the temple and set up the China Travel Service to treat tourists well. In the summer of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), Mr. Zhang Xueliang came and stayed here, and a fire broke out due to electricity, destroying almost everything. The foundation still remains."

Near the temple, there is a Qianzhang Cliff, which is unfathomable when viewed from above. The waterfall is like a white silk, rushing down. When Mr. Zhang Xueliang came here, he lit firecrackers and threw them under the cliff, and the sound was so loud that it seemed like the mountain was collapsing. Moving forward and spiraling down to Shangyintan, the surrounding cliffs are steep, with only one road accessible. The fine rain is drifting and dancing in the wind, making one feel cool and refreshed. Going down to Zhongyintan and Xiayintan, they are all rare scenic spots.

The scenery of Xikou is magnificent, and the losses are also considerable.

The scenery of Xikou can be said to be magnificent, but the losses during the war are also very considerable. It was bombed by enemy planes thirteen times, and after the fall, it was damaged by enemy puppet bandits. According to statistics, 217 people were shot to death, 73 people were kidnapped and missing, 128 Western-style houses were completely burned down, 630 multi-story buildings, 702 single-story buildings, 95 Western-style houses were half-destroyed, 1,360 multi-story buildings, 470 single-story buildings, 15,000 piculs of rice were lost, 230,000 catties of grain, 377 cattle, 648 pigs, more than 4,800 large trees, 1.5 million bamboos, more than 2,000 boxes of tea, and 98 self-defense firearms. Putting it all together, this number is also very considerable.

There is a police station in the town, with only twelve policemen including the police chief. The salary of each policeman is only more than 8,000 yuan, which is not particularly generous. Even Chairman Chiang's residence is not as good as the Pan Villa where we spent a night at the foot of Tianmu Mountain. Mr. Yu Jimin told me, "In the past, Commander Liu Maoen went to Xikou to visit Chairman Chiang. When he came back, he said to people, 'I thought the hometown of someone who is concerned with the safety of the country must be very luxurious, but seeing Mr. Chiang so simple really makes us ashamed!'"

### Responding to Readers - Legal Questions

(1) Family Disputes

Chen Xin asks: A was betrothed to B at the age of thirteen by his parents' arrangement and the words of a matchmaker. They were married hastily in the 24th year of the Republic (1935) without a major ceremony (commonly known as "worshipping at the stove"). They now have four children. In the summer of the 30th year of the Republic (1941), B suddenly suffered from mental illness, which was cured after two months of treatment. A now intends to divorce B. There are three questions:

(1) Are couples married by "worshipping at the stove" in the countryside legally married? (2) Can having suffered from mental illness that has now been cured be grounds for divorce? (3) In the spring of this year (the 35th year of the Republic, 1946), A and B had a lawyer notarize a separation agreement, each holding a copy as proof. How can they proceed with a thorough divorce? Does it need to be resolved in court?

[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin replies:] (1) Marriages made by worshipping at the stove in the countryside can be regarded as customary law and do not constitute an illegal condition for marriage, as long as there was a public ceremony at the time and two or more witnesses, it is legal. (2) Only a serious and incurable mental illness can constitute grounds for divorce. (3) If the woman is also willing to divorce, both parties should write a divorce agreement, each holding a copy as proof. Otherwise, a divorce suit must be filed in court, but only if the woman has conditions that constitute grounds for divorce.

(2) Returning Engagement Gifts and Debts

Wang Yinzhi asks: My friend, Ms. Li, was engaged to a certain gentleman several years ago. Now, due to disagreements, she wants to terminate the engagement, and the other party, knowing that it cannot be forced, also agrees. However, he demands that all the assistance he voluntarily gave in the past be returned, calculated at five thousand times the original amount. Is this request legal?

[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin replies:] To determine whether to increase the calculation by a certain multiple when repaying old debts, both parties should negotiate in a fair manner. This is a factual matter, and the law does not explicitly specify any increase in multiples. If both parties cannot reach an agreement, they can only resort to the court for resolution.

(3) Wang Dake asks: When I was fifteen years old, my parents arranged for me to be engaged to a girl through a matchmaker. I absolutely disagree with this engagement. Now I have another girlfriend, and we hope to spend our lives together, but because of the previous agreement, I cannot get engaged. I have repeatedly urged my parents to terminate the previous agreement, and although my parents have agreed, they have been slow to do so. I have several questions, please answer:

(1) Is this engagement valid without my consent? Do my parents have the right to force me to fulfill it? (2) Is it a crime to get engaged to my girlfriend now? Does the previous agreement have any binding effect on me? Do I have to terminate it first? Who should terminate the engagement? (3) Is it valid if the parents do not preside over the engagement and marriage? (4) What is the standard for the age of adulthood for men and women?

[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin replies:] (1) Engagements should be entered into by the man and woman themselves, and others should not force them. (2) Since you do not agree to the previous engagement, you or your parents can come forward to negotiate the termination with the other party. If the other party is not at fault, you should also pay them reasonable compensation for damages. This damage is not limited to property damage. After the engagement is terminated, you can get engaged to someone else. (3) There is no need for parents to preside, but there must be a public ceremony and two or more witnesses. Twenty years old is considered adulthood.

### Daoyi Society Distributes Coffins

The Daoyi Society of Ying Shi Road Middle School, adhering to the principle of Daoyi, is concerned about all charitable causes and earnestly carries them out. In the summer, they provide free medical consultations, medicine, and tea, and in the winter, they provide free clothing and porridge. They have never slackened in their efforts to provide assistance according to the seasons. Seeing that those who die without coffins are extremely pitiful, they have expanded their coffin distribution program to help families who cannot afford funerals. Thanks to the generosity of four great philanthropists, Xia Yanqing, Li Runtian, Li Xiaoyan, and Wang Juji, who donated a large batch of planks worth about 4 million yuan, workers have been hired to rush to make coffins. Anyone who is impoverished, dies, and cannot afford a funeral can apply to our society through the social service office, and a certificate from the local Baojia head is required.

### Approved to Proceed Upstream

— Our Newspaper’s 24th Dispatch from Huainan — Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi

The Absurdity of Tianjia'an

Considering the entire Anhui province, Tianjia'an is truly its heart. Every day at five o'clock, a single engine is dispatched from the Jiulonggang depot, pulling a train eastward towards Bengbu that departs at eight in the morning. Today, I arrived here by train and then transferred to a connecting Huainan Road steamer to Zhengyangguan.

As dawn gradually broke, the dilapidated Tianjia'an was revealed in increasing clarity. The dock on the water's edge has been unused for eight years and is now completely submerged by the Huai River. The broken trestle looks like the skeleton of a giant beast, protruding from the water, as if lamenting its past glory.

Mr. Zhang Qian, who presided over the Construction Committee, came here excitedly to hold a groundbreaking ceremony when the Huai Road was being built. His achievements have been swallowed up one by one in the flood of history. This road is a testament to his legacy. Tianjia'an is quiet and ruined, its scale still discernible. This is truly the most heartbreaking and tragic sight.

At that time, the business revenue from the Yu Road ranked second in the country in terms of average kilometers, with the Zhengtai Road ranking first. With a monthly income of 600,000, a bank loan interest payment of 100,000, and expenses of 180,000, there was a net surplus of 320,000. The Huainan Coal Mine was not even included. This was a good source of income for the country. After the Construction Committee concluded, the capital of the Construction Bank was incorporated, gradually turning it into a private enterprise. Currently, without this huge private capital investment, the smooth commencement of operations at the Datong and Huainan mines would be quite problematic.

Under the Huainan Company are the Mining and Railway Bureaus. As for the Railway Bureau, needless to say, the Director Wu Jingqing, Deputy Director Wu Weizhong, and Ning Shufan are all capable men. The latter two are veterans of Huainan. Ning once managed the China Merchants Bureau's business during the Anti-Japanese War, handling it not only with ease but also with familiarity. However, they are currently operating trains on a borrowed line, and the restoration of the Tianyu track is both within reach and seemingly out of reach. The present is a period of distress. As for the Director of the Mining Bureau, Wang Dezi (mistakenly written as Ning in the previous section), he was the mine manager of Datong before the war, with Xie Jigang and Li Jing as Deputy Mine Managers. The reason why Datong Mine was incorporated into the Huainan Company was due to the convenience of merging, but in fact, it also had its own capital difficulties. In today's China, it is truly not easy for genuine private capital to be put to use.

Seeing the miserable state of Tianjia'an, I felt quite emotional. No one knows how many people live in Tianjia'an, it is said that even the town chief himself doesn't know. It borders the Huai River to the north, belongs to Huaiyuan County, and adjoins Fengtai and Shou Counties. From here, south to Shuijia Lake, this narrow strip of land is bordered by Huanggu Dang to the east, Wabu Lake to the west, and the Huai River to the north, making it surrounded by water on three sides. Anhui's notorious bandits have all gathered here at some point. It is said that the likes of Sun Meiyao and "Big Braid Zhang" all had their golden age here. Quite a few people have also started their careers here and "turned over a new leaf." The opening of the Huainan Road has precisely disrupted this old nest. However, the term "atmosphere," while seemingly abstract, is actually concrete. The "heroes" who commit crimes in the three counties still tend to use this place as a sanctuary. Almost every household in this area has firearms. The people are happy to seek out weapons and never tire of it. When the Japanese army was stationed in this mining area, they dismantled houses from Taixian to build barracks. After the surrender, many guns were sold. A handgun could be obtained for 1,000 yuan, and a Type 38 rifle for less than 1,000. It truly found its place. "Civilian armed forces" are thriving. It's not like when the Japanese devils were here, when one couldn't play around casually.

Twenty days ago, a robbery occurred next door to the military camp here. Some say it's because there are many demobilized soldiers, others say it's

The newly repaired dike, with the Zhun River on its right. The masts of the sailboats are lined up, and the water level is several meters higher than the ground on the left side of the dike.

are traveling bandits, looking for a few coins. In short, people are panic-stricken. There are indeed a considerable number of demobilized soldiers, coming from Henan or northern Anhui, transferring through here to Jinpu, Nanjing, or southern Anhui. Officers have officers' teams to join, but most go to seek their own employment—of course, still mainly military-related. They travel with their families, lack travel funds, and are extremely temperamental. However, everyone forgives and sympathizes with them, but this is just empty talk and does not help in reality.

Speaking of bandits, if you go more than ten miles east down the Huai River, in places like Old Shipyard and Matoucheng, it is said that there are one or two thousand people on both banks, with machine guns. Merchant ships often have accidents. A small number of ships dare not sail alone. They must join together in groups of two or three hundred and request military escort, passing by in a mighty, boisterous procession. Being in the midst of it is certainly tense and truly spectacular. Unfortunately, I dare not try it and cannot tell you about the experience.

The new garrison commander got angry because the town chief didn't even know the number of residents. Now, they are finally checking the household registration. A pile of yellow earth and thatched huts—it's simply impossible to describe its characteristics. This is a typical small market town common in northern Anhui. Honest businessmen cannot easily establish themselves. Local thugs will definitely stir things up and ruin you. However, the place where they can roam most freely is the gambling den, which is very prosperous. People gamble to the point of madness, often with real knives and guns.

There are "unreliable" small hotels, whose scale is not even as good as the "Treasure Hotels" in Yuchengjiang, Guangxi, or Jieshou, Henan. As soon as travelers from Bengbu arrive at Zhengyangguan, they immediately rush onto the Huainan Road steamers for connecting transportation, even if it means sleeping in the open. Of course, on the one hand, it is also for a few coins. Observing the declining and absurd Tianjia'an, one truly cannot believe that this is China. "You'll know once you go up there. This whole area is like this," a mine policeman said seriously to me. Therefore, I thought of people like Zhang... and I also expressed my admiration for the gentlemen of the Road and Mining Bureaus currently in the bunkers. I also want to wish many travelers (including myself) and all the heroes well. (Photos by Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi)

Upstream on the Huai River

Between Tianjia'an and Zhengyangguan, it takes nine hours upstream and five hours downstream. State-run and commercially-run transportation services have no fixed schedule after purchasing tickets. They only operate when they can make a profit. The Huainan Road operates two steamers daily on this section, connecting with the train. As a result, the business of these state-run and commercially-run services has been completely taken over. They have opened up another route, rushing to the Ying River to open Fuyang and Jieshou—one of the famous smuggling dens during the Anti-Japanese War.

Now, departing west from Tianjia'an is an ordinary inland river small steamer, towing a large wooden barge, the old No. 6 coal boat of the Datong Mine before the war. Old Huai River sailors can still name and recount the experiences of each boat. They all regret that many good boats were pulled to Zhengyangguan and burned for firewood during the retreat. They show no interest in this old boat. "It's like people," said an old sailor, "The young and strong on the Huai River are either dead or gone, and only we old useless ones are still hanging on."

He seemed quite ashamed of "still hanging on." "Still hanging on" is another way of saying succumbing to fate, but he doesn't think so, which shows his character and customs.

The scope of his words is too broad, encompassing the entire eight years from the Anti-Japanese War to the present. War, famine, plague, as well as his own increasing aging and poverty. I sat in the cabin at the stern of the wooden barge, watching the armed road patrol police with live ammunition. A machine gun was mounted on the bow. If a small boat approached, they would immediately fire a warning shot to make it go away. As for the turbulent Huai River and the widespread disaster area, I gained a clearer understanding of them by boat. The higher we went upstream, the more ferocious the yellow water became. If it weren't for the treetops and rooftops sticking out, what we passed through would almost have been a Yellow Sea. The old captain was able to distinguish the location of the river channel by relying on the indication of these treetops. Such a large disaster situation does not attract serious attention from the whole country, and the people in the disaster area remain silent. This is truly a cold China! Not a single responsible official comes here to take a look, yet they talk about being the vanguard of the people and shirk responsibility. When it comes to disaster relief, all they talk about is money. These are not the kind of officials that the Chinese people need.

The people on the boat were all cold, all disaster-stricken people, only saying "listen to fate," and believing that everything else should be "forgotten." They carried their own goods, transporting a little bit of cargo from Bengbu. Among them was a middle-aged woman from Fuyang, who, because she was looking for the corpses of her husband and son, first followed the Ying River to Zhengyangguan, then followed the Huai River to Tianjia'an, but to no avail. Today, she was returning in disappointment. More than twenty days ago, a small steamer departed from Zhengyang and went straight to Jieshou, loaded with people and goods. After passing Fuyang, it encountered a large whirlpool of yellow water, overturning the boat. The boat was found forty miles downstream, and only four passengers were pulled out of the cabin, still with some breath left, and were eventually rescued. The rest were all missing. The woman said, "It's all destined." She didn't blame anyone, so she seemed very calm in her grief. This event further increased the tragedy.

Arriving at Zhengyangguan, the yellow water was pouring out of the Ying River. Zhengyangguan was almost completely submerged. At its worst, only one square mile was not flooded. Now that the water has receded a little, Zhengyangguan still has only two square kilometers where one can walk without getting wet feet. Surrounded by water on all sides, only an isolated island remains. Our steamer traveled through the fields, with the rooftops being the best land. I will introduce this painful Zhengyangguan in another article.

Correction: In the "Approved to Proceed Upstream (1)" section, in the "Silent Disaster Area" section, there is an estimate of the disaster area being approximately 50,000 square kilometers. The word "万" (wan, ten thousand) is a mistake for "千" (qian, thousand). This is now specifically corrected as above. A scene of the Huainan flood (Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi)

### Taiwan Tropical Medicine Research Institute

— Our Newspaper’s 23rd Dispatch from Taipei — Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun

During the period of Japanese rule, Taiwan was treated as a part of Japan. In addition to the policy of extracting resources, they tried their best to overcome the threats posed by natural geography through scientific research. In particular, they needed to encourage Japanese mainlanders to reproduce in Taiwan, and they needed to exchange one share of financial resources for three shares of labor from the local population. Therefore, the development of tropical medicine research for health care and hygiene was inevitable.

Japan does not have a subtropical climate. Taiwan is truly "blessed by nature." In order to ensure the reduction of the death rate of Japanese mainlanders in Taiwan and their adaptation to tropical life, they spared no manpower and material resources in medicine. The Tropical Medicine Research Institute grew under such circumstances.

### Fake Medicines Rampant, Harming National Health

The Tropical Medicine Research Institute, which has been established for 38 years, initially only had a Chemistry Department and a Hygiene Department. Later, it belonged to the Central Research Institute. Seven years ago, it was affiliated with National Taiwan University, becoming a major research institute coordinating with others related to the South Seas and the sugar industry. The outlines of the Department of Tropical Diseases, Department of Tropical Hygiene, Department of Bacterial Immunology, Department of Chemistry, Department of Nutrition, and Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, which are established in the institute, show that they not only focus on the research, investigation, experimentation, and prevention of tropical diseases, but also include nutritional physiology and pathology, as well as the analysis and identification of medicines, directly and indirectly serving the patients, pharmaceutical manufacturing, medical treatment, research, and maintenance of health in tropical regions.

Dr. Chen Lijie, who presides over the institute's affairs, told the reporter: "The institute has three branch offices in Shilin, Taichung, and Tainan. Shilin is the experimental site for bacterial and immunological products, while the branch offices in Taichung and Tainan specialize in the experimentation, inspection, and sealing of medical and hygiene medicines. Medicines brought to Taiwan during the Japanese era needed to be inspected and sealed by the institute before they could be sold. Approximately 30,000 items were inspected each year. This law was abolished after the restoration. Although more than 10,000 items are still being inspected, the fake medicines sold by fraudulent merchants are very rampant. This is not only a hidden danger for Taiwan, but it directly harms national health!"

### Mass Production, Not Afraid of Infectious Bacteria

Taiwan is not afraid of the inflow of infectious diseases. The plague brought from Fuzhou and the cholera invading from the south raged for some time. Because of the rapid measures taken by the health authorities and the institute's production of 1.4 million doses of plague vaccine in two weeks, and the regular supply of cholera vaccine, distributed to various counties and cities for preventive injections, the life-threatening plague was quickly eliminated. This base for destroying epidemics is the Shilin Research Branch.

The institute not only produces various preventive vaccines, including diphtheria, rabies, meningitis, cholera, plague, etc., but also produces diphtheria serum, pertussis, smallpox vaccine, etc. for treatment. Normally, various biological products such as serum, vaccines, and smallpox vaccine can produce 300,000 doses per month, and can be increased to 3 million doses when necessary. From the time of reception in December of last year to July, they produced 8,615,386 doses of injections and 43,373 CC of serum, including:

Typhoid vaccine: 49,760 doses

Plague vaccine: 1,228,844 doses

Epidemic Cerebrospinal Meningitis Bacteria: 742,520 doses

Cholera vaccine: 2,816,530 doses

Typhoid and Paratyphoid Mixed Vaccine: 808,440 doses

Measles vaccine: 15 doses

Smallpox vaccine: 2,963,870 doses

Diphtheria Prophylactic: 3,440 doses

Pertussis vaccine: 595 doses

Dysentery vaccine: 1,200 doses

Hemorrhagic Toxic Polyvalent Serum: 156 doses

Neurotoxic Polyvalent Serum: 16 doses

Cholera Diagnostic Serum: 30 CC

Gas Gangrene Serum: 3,000 CC

Tetanus Serum: 13,160 CC

Epidemic Cerebrospinal Meningitis Serum:

1,120 CC

Diphtheria Serum: 27,060 CC

Pulmonary Tuberculosis Diagnostic Solution: 3 CC

These accurate numbers not only tell us that more than 16 kinds of pathogens can be prevented and treated with guarantees, but also show that they are doing solid disinfection work for mankind. They have not been affected by the reception and restoration. Although their research work was suspended for half a year, and the director has recently devoted himself to restoring it, this only applies to the general institute.

### Riding the Long Wind and Breaking Ten Thousand Miles of Waves: Notes from the "General Meigu" Ship

— Huang Yingqian

The "General Meigu" is one of the main transport ships of the United States, with a deadweight tonnage of 22,000 tons. It had a brilliant contribution during the war. For example, in the US military's attack on Okinawa, it carried 7,000 soldiers from San Francisco in one trip, landing at Manila. The ship was also equipped with radar. Although there are still uncleared mines in the Pacific, everyone felt very safe. This time, it came to China to load American demobilized soldiers returning home, and also carried more than 500 passengers from various countries. There were about 200 Chinese passengers, the most passengers ever carried on this ship since the end of the war. On the 4th of last month, Mr. Huang Delu and I hurriedly carried our luggage onto the ship and spent the night on board.

Four Announcements from the Loudspeaker

On the morning of the 5th, the ship's loudspeaker broadcast several announcements: (1) Inspection of epidemic prevention certificates starts at 9:00 AM. (2) Passengers are requested not to go ashore, and are absolutely not allowed to go ashore. (3) The ship will set sail at 4:00 PM. (4) Gambling is not allowed after 12:00 midnight. The passengers, full of farewell emotions, began to feel nervous. At 9:00 AM, everyone held their epidemic prevention certificates, and the police officers sent by the Shanghai Customs came aboard to conduct the inspection. In the past, foreigners were protected by unequal treaties and were not subject to inspection. Since the abolition of unequal treaties, all foreign officers and soldiers and people from various countries on board, including Chinese passengers, must be inspected with certificates. This clearly shows that China's international status has indeed improved. Suddenly, a passenger was found to have smallpox and was immediately taken off the ship. If a person with infectious diseases such as smallpox or cholera is found on board in an American port, not only is the patient not allowed to go ashore, but the luggage of other passengers and even the hull of the ship must be disinfected and cleaned before being allowed to dock. Therefore, epidemic prevention is indeed one of the main tasks on board. At 4:00 PM, the ship set sail and slowly sailed out of the Wusongkou. Mr. Huang and I looked at each other and said, "A journey of ten thousand miles begins with a single step," riding the long wind and breaking ten thousand miles of waves.

The Pacific Ocean is Truly Peaceful

My home is in Meishan. When I was young, I read Mr. Su Dongpo's famous poem: "The river in my hometown first originates, official travels send the river directly into the sea." I explored the source of the river in Luokou, but I have never seen the magnificent sight of the water flowing into the Yangtze River and returning to the sea. This time, standing on the General Meigu ship and sailing through the place where the river flows into the sea, I truly felt the vastness of the ocean. The giant ship stood tall, and Chongming Island was faintly visible in the distance. Sometimes, sails rose and fell, and water gulls appeared and disappeared. The sea and sky were vast, and the scenery was very pleasant. It is said that there are three routes to San Francisco: (1) Via Hong Kong and Manila to San Francisco. (2) Via Yokohama and Honolulu to San Francisco. (3) Via the Sea of Japan, along the North Pacific Ocean, past the Aleutian Islands, and turning south directly to San Francisco. The "General Meigu" took this direct route because it could shorten the journey by two to three days. Usually, it takes at least half a month to travel from Shanghai to San Francisco via Honolulu. Since taking the direct route, it takes twelve days to reach San Francisco. However, in these twelve days of direct sailing on the ocean, not a single flower, grass, tree, or stone can be seen. The sky is connected to the water, and the water is connected to the sky. The snow waves, sunlight, sea gulls, whales, and the azure color of the water are the only wonders on the sea. In the vast void, infinite warmth and comfort are added. The route chart is based on the earth's longitude and latitude, and the direction is very accurate. The ship passed through the Sea of Japan and along the North Pacific Ocean, becoming colder and colder. On the twelfth day, when passing the Earth's Meridian, there was wind, rain, and dense fog, and the cold current hit people. Everyone had to wear cotton clothes. The passengers on the whole ship felt the pain of being tossed about. After passing this southwest, entering the Western Hemisphere, it became hotter and hotter. The ship's speed is about 18 knots per hour. I heard that the United States is rushing to build new ships, with a speed increased to 30 knots per hour. It takes six days to get from Shanghai to San Francisco. This is truly a signal of speed and convenience for future passengers. When leaving Shanghai, my friends raised their glasses to wish me a smooth journey. The stability of the ship made me grateful for my friends' blessings and prayers. The Pacific Ocean is truly peaceful!

Normally, the facilities of ocean-going merchant ships are quite magnificent, with libraries, swimming pools, cinemas, dance halls, billiard rooms, etc. From morning to night, guests can enjoy various pleasant entertainments. At present, passenger and commercial transport between China and the United States has not been officially restored. The "Meigu" is a transport ship. The cabins are divided into first class for American officers, first class for people from various countries, and first class for American soldiers. The ship still has a semi-military nature of management, so various facilities are of course lacking. The general guest life is characterized by boredom, dizziness, and sleepiness. In terms of food, it is called a buffet. Three meals a day, when the bell rings, all the guests line up in batches, file into the restaurant, hold their plates, and wait to be assigned food. They must return the plates to the designated place. Beef, mutton, pork, and a small amount of vegetables and fruits are distributed in rotation every day. All the meat is sweet and greasy. For the first three days, it was still delicious. After the fifth day, it was painful to eat. Holding the plate and feeling depressed, drinking coffee and feeling bored. Everyone asked each other: What is the first thing you will do when you get to San Francisco? The answer must be: Eating Chinese food is the first thing. There are also more than a hundred Jewish guests who eat many times a day. They do not eat in the restaurant, and they mutter words in their mouths when eating, still maintaining their unique customs. This stateless nation still has more than a thousand families living in a village outside the East Gate of Kaifeng in our country, and they have generally been assimilated by the Chinese. Many Chinese passengers are living their first ocean voyage. They feel seasick as soon as they get on the boat, and they are sleepy in the bunks. After meals, they often go to the bunks, take a novel, and study while sleepy. In the evenings, Chinese and foreign people gather in the restaurant to play Chinese chess, push dominoes, play mahjong, and play poker, until 12:00 midnight, when they reluctantly disperse. From 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM, Chinese friends also organize lectures, and there are solo performances by young ladies and Peking opera, etc. Everyone also prints a book called "Same Boat Record," showing a group of enthusiasm and harmony. The authentic style of Sichuan friends is to tell stories. Thus, morning and evening, the short twelve-day journey felt like it flew by. When the ship arrived in San Francisco, everyone felt very sad and reluctant to say goodbye to the "Meigu."

Preparations Before Going to the United States

Going abroad is not an easy thing. It is quite troublesome. In the future, when passenger transport between China and the United States is restored, the number of people going abroad will increase. Regarding the preparations before going to the United States, I will write out one by one the experiences I have gained this time, for readers to refer to: (1) Passport: Ordinary passports are applied for by various agencies, approved by various departments, and then issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Official passports must be approved by the National Government before they can be received. Diplomatic passports are for government diplomatic personnel and government special envoys. Holders of this passport enjoy exemption from inspection when passing through any port customs. After obtaining the passport for going abroad. You must complete the injection procedures at the Jianghai Customs Epidemic Prevention Office or a designated hospital, and obtain a yellow certificate from the Epidemic Prevention Office before you can buy a ticket from the shipping company. The more foreign exchange you bring to the United States, the better. If you bring too little foreign exchange, or less than 1,000 yuan, you must have a definite guarantee before you can go ashore. This is one thing that the US consulate must inquire about. (2) British and American habits are different. The British have gentlemanly manners. In restaurants and living rooms, they must dress neatly and respect their appearance. Americans are more rough and unrestrained, and they are more casual and natural. Their clothing is neat and polite. Therefore, when going abroad, you should bring pajamas, sleeping pants, toothbrushes, spittoons, slippers, and other things that the ship should have. Clothing should be determined according to the season, and it is best to bring less. (3) In terms of food, be sure to bring Sichuan pickled vegetables, Yunnan mustard tuber, and Chinese canned food that you want to buy. You should bring more Chinese tea. If you are tired of eating the food on the ship, you can eat a little mustard tuber or drink a cup of Chinese tea, which can greatly refresh your mind and nourish your energy. These preparations must be paid attention to. Residents of Huainan built small dikes to drain water in a primitive way (Photo by Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi)

### The Burden on Little Brains is Too Heavy

To the Editor:

At this moment of rebuilding everything, education is the foundation for establishing a nation and cultivating talents, and elementary school education should be given special attention. Although the Ministry of Education has regulations regarding elementary school education, and experts are often invited to discuss it, there are still several aspects of elementary school education in Shanghai that do not meet the standards. Therefore, I feel compelled to speak out.

First, in Shanghai, perhaps due to environmental factors, English courses are added as early as the third grade of elementary school. In reality, these children are only seven years old. Their brains are simple and fragile. When taught foreign languages, they cannot grasp the meaning or comprehend. They only repeat what the teacher says, echoing the sounds. They do not understand the spelling of letters or the concept of singular and plural in grammar. The children, fearing punishment from the teacher, and urged on by their parents, spend a lot of time studying hard after class. The fragile brains are burdened too heavily. Why not explicitly correct this ineffective teaching method and postpone the start of English until the fifth grade, as is the case in municipal schools?

Second, teachers require elementary school students to copy books or new words in pencil after returning home from school. The daily amount can be as high as seven or eight hundred characters, and at least three or four hundred characters. Children, after school, have to prepare for calligraphy, diaries, or arithmetic exercises, and must also work at their desks, unable to engage in outdoor activities. Sometimes, they are not finished even at dusk, and must continue working after dinner, which affects their physical strength and eyesight, and cultivates a careless attitude. Is it easy to create a physically and mentally healthy citizenry in this way? Teachers intend to give students more training, but have they ever considered the negative consequences of this?

The above two points are based on my observations of four or five children in school in my family and those of friends, and after careful study, I believe there is a need for improvement. Therefore, I offer these humble opinions and ask your publication to publish them for the reference of elementary school education authorities.

The Rampant Gambling and Opium in Qibao Town

To the Editor: Qibao is an important town in western Shanghai, formerly located at the intersection of Shangsong and Qing counties. Currently, it is incorporated into the Shanghai urban area. The administration of Songyi has been taken over by the urban area, but the police force has not been extended due to insufficient allocation in the urban area. The Qingyi police have been withdrawn by order of superiors. The town is temporarily maintained by the town chief, but there are also district chiefs from the urban area, and the administration is not unified. Unscrupulous individuals are taking the opportunity to sell drugs. Although the Longhua sub-bureau has heard of this and often sends personnel to the town to investigate, the sellers are forewarned and escape. The gambling atmosphere is also terrible! Teahouses are disguised gambling dens. In this small town, there are fifteen teahouses, each with three or four mahjong tables, and a gambling table. This is what I have seen and heard, and no one cares! I hope the authorities will work with local agencies to thoroughly implement the joint liability method of the past! (Wang Dasheng)

### Reply by Mail

Reply to Mr. Liu Guisheng: Your letter of the 28th was forwarded to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for investigation. We have now received a reply from Chairman Wang Fangong stating: "This matter has been handed over to the relevant authorities for thorough investigation. The results will be communicated separately. Please be informed accordingly."

Reply to Mr. Wang and Mr. Chen: The Social Affairs Bureau replied regarding the distribution of sugar, stating: "An investigation was conducted. According to the report, the Lao Tongsheng Nanhuo Store in Laoximen, Nanshi, distributed 30 bags of sugar in the ninth round, which were sold on the 14th, 15th, and 16th of this month, as recorded in the accounts. All remaining empty bags are stored in the store, and the inspection found no discrepancies. The accusation that the distributed sugar flowed into the black market cannot be substantiated." This is a special reply.

Reply to Mr. Sun Kezhi: The Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau replied that the property at a certain number in Baochangli has been found not to be enemy property. This is a special reply.

Reply to Mr. Hu Yongyuan: Letter received. Regarding the issue of unifying academic terms in the numerical naming method, if the term "yi" is used consistently instead of "wan wan" (ten thousand squared), there will be no ambiguity as you pointed out.

Hygiene and Medicine

### Talking About Personality

— Xia Zhenyi

The Secret of Mental Hygiene

Among your relatives, friends, or siblings, you can often find two completely different personalities: one type is often taciturn, suspicious and sensitive, unsociable, and does not like sports or entertainment. He seems isolated from group life. He is constantly deep in thought, indulging in fantasies to find his only satisfaction. Sometimes, during the day, he abandons work to daydream, building many castles in the air. In public gatherings, he often stays alone, unwilling to participate in conversations and laughter. He feels shy and blushes in crowded places. He avoids opportunities to speak in public. Even if he memorizes his speech perfectly, he becomes embarrassed on stage and cannot say a word.

Introversion and Extroversion

The other type of personality is completely the opposite of the one described above. He is talkative and active, consistent in word and deed, eloquent, and sociable. He can speak confidently to the crowd. In public places, he easily mingles with strangers and quickly becomes acquainted. He is often a leader in groups and is an exhibitionist. However, his emotions are easily fluctuated. He is extremely excited when excited and extremely depressed when unhappy. The great psychologist C.C. Jung gave these two types of personalities two names: the former is called "Introverts," and the latter is called "Extroverts."

Because introverts are too narrow-minded, suspicious, and prone to worry, they can only make a few friends, and they are only casual acquaintances. They rarely have confidants. They feel even more awkward when interacting with the opposite sex because they cannot forget themselves. They are always aware of their gender. Whenever they meet a stranger, they like to know the person's background. If they find that this person's status or achievement is higher than theirs, it triggers a strong sense of inferiority. Therefore, they often avoid this person and reduce contact to maintain their feeling of being "superior." However, extroverts, because they can forget themselves and are sincere, can get along with everyone and develop close relationships. Because they are straightforward and not humble or pretentious, people are willing to associate with them and become close friends. If they encounter people of higher status, they will flatter them in every way. People who like to ingratiate themselves belong to this type of personality.

Personality and Occupation

The difference in personality is closely related to the choice of occupation. Many people fail because their occupations are not compatible with their personalities. Introverts prefer to work alone and cannot cooperate with others. Suitable occupations for them are writers, artists, tailors, bank accountants, clerks, librarians, or laboratory technicians. If an active "extrovert" takes on such a job, there will certainly be no good results. Extroverts, because they can cooperate with others and have ambition, decisiveness, and leadership desires, are most suitable to be lawyers, doctors, politicians, diplomats, salespeople, etc. If these jobs are given to introverts, it will not be easy to achieve good results.

As for the relationship between personality and nationality, it is a very interesting question. Although there are no concrete statistics to rely on, based on general observation: Eastern nationalities are more inclined towards introverted personalities; Western nationalities are more extroverted. This is not without reason. For thousands of years, our country has been influenced by Confucianism, "emphasizing literature and de-emphasizing military affairs," which is equivalent to emphasizing thought and de-emphasizing action. The precepts that guided children in the past, "There are golden houses in books, and there are beauties like jade in books," were nothing more than to make them "refined gentlemen" and "frail scholars," all of which encouraged introversion and hindered the development of extroversion.

The lives of Western nationalities are completely opposite to those of China. Their children develop a habit of being lively and adventurous from an early age, and spend most of their energy on things outside of themselves. Therefore, foreign children are more lively than the average Chinese child.

Indeed, extroversion and introversion only represent two extreme tendencies. You cannot clearly divide all of humanity into two categories: introverts and extroverts. The personality of the average person is between the two. He exhibits introversion in some things, but at the same time, he exhibits extroversion in others. Extreme introversion and extroversion are not the most suitable phenomena. Extremely extroverted personalities are bound to be reckless and careless people; extreme introverts, because they are too timid and weak, dare not face the difficulties of reality and retreat into fantasy. From the perspective of psychiatry, extreme introversion is a model of schizophrenia, and extreme extroversion is a precursor to mania.

The formation of our personality, in addition to being inherited from our parents, is more importantly influenced by the habits and environment we develop as children. There is a Chinese saying, "It is easier to change mountains and rivers than to alter one's nature." This statement is certainly correct, but it is not entirely true. We cannot change innate factors, but we can compensate for acquired factors. This leads to the responsibility of parents. If parents encounter children with extreme personalities, they should try their best to provide appropriate guidance so that they can gradually change and achieve appropriate improvements.

Several Rules

For children with extreme extroversion, pay attention to the following four points:

(1) Give the child plenty of work because he has plenty of energy and guide him to vent it in beneficial directions.

(2) Strengthen his body and give him various outdoor activities.

(3) Cultivate independence and a sense of responsibility, and cultivate the habit of finishing a task once it has been started.

(4) Help him control his emotions.

For children with extreme introversion, pay attention to:

(1) Fully exercise the body, interact with others, and eliminate the tendency to escape.

(2) Expand the scope of his interests.

(3) Encourage reasonable socialization.

(4) If there are problems, encourage him to fully and freely discuss them with his parents. Because this type of child often dwells on and fantasizes about certain difficulties, resulting in a psychology of suspicion and fear, and dares not boldly propose them for discussion. Such as issues like "sex," "the mysteries of life," and "death," parents should take the opportunity to raise and discuss them.

After analyzing your personality and discovering that you have extroverted or introverted qualities, do not have unfounded fears. Know that introverts and extroverts each have their place. Introverts are the providers of ideas and insights; extroverts are the implementers of ideas. Without these two types of people, the world would never have progressed to the atomic age of today. "Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will win every battle." We are members of this "world battlefield." To cope with this ever-changing and complex modern society, and to succeed in all undertakings, there is only one secret: understand your personality.

### The Incubation Period of Mental Illness

— Liu Yueci

Hygiene is Prevention of Disease

Mental illness, like other diseases, does not happen overnight. It also has a so-called "incubation period." However, the manifestations of its incubation period are not as obvious as those of ordinary diseases, so they are easily overlooked. This is probably due to the traditional emphasis on the body rather than the spirit, so people rush to seek medical treatment after having a fever for three days, hoping for a quick recovery. However, if a person's temperament suddenly becomes irritable, or if he is prone to worry and unhappiness, people think it is just a normal occurrence. In fact, a three-day fever, although seemingly serious, can indeed be cured with one injection and two medicines; psychological abnormality, although without vomiting or pain, and seemingly mild on the surface, can actually develop into a thorny and serious disease over time. First, people are generally reluctant to seek medical treatment; second, people's minds do not pay much attention to the fact that the mental aspect can also get sick. Therefore, there are many cases where chronic and subtle mental disorders gradually develop into severe mental illnesses. In other words, crazy people did not become crazy overnight, because their symptoms had been incubating for a period of time, but their manifestations were not noticed early enough and prevented.

Society is complex, the environment is stimulating, and people's desires are uniformly high. It is not easy to have desires satisfied, and if they cannot be achieved, it is difficult to avoid psychological烦恼 and conflicts. In this situation, no one can be sure who will not be stimulated and develop mental illness. Furthermore, mental illness cannot be prevented with a single injection. The only method is to constantly examine ourselves in daily life, take precautions, and avoid the madness from developing and becoming uncontrollable. Examining oneself and studying oneself, the object is not others, but oneself, which is the most convenient and hygienic thing to do. The General Epidemic Prevention Team is spraying delousing water for people in the countryside near Xuzhou.

Nameless Depression

A simple method of examining ourselves is to constantly study our own state of mind. In terms of spirit, if we are often anxious, worrying about everything that need not be worried about, or often suspicious, suspecting that everyone in the world is not to be trusted, and even suspecting that others are plotting to harm ourselves, and normally, when we see others happy, we always feel three or four points of inexplicable dissatisfaction, if we have this time, we must ask ourselves, whether our dissatisfaction has a significant reason, whether our worries have a significant object, whether the changes in our emotions have persistence, for example, when we lose our temper, whether it will pass immediately, or if it will never end, for example, if we watch a tragedy, we will cry for three days in a row, because everyone can always feel some changes in their psychology, if the examination shows that our behavior is different from others, that may be a psychological abnormality of varying degrees.

Some people often see things that others cannot see, such as animals or statues of gods, and some people often hear words that others cannot hear,历 their sins, and some people always have strange thoughts, often thinking that they are great men in the world. I remember that there was a patient who insisted that he was Marshal Ma, but he was actually an unemployed rickshaw puller, and some people were convinced that they were famous rich people, but their economic situation was actually abject poverty.

Excessive Suspicion

Sometimes we will make some useless and unnecessary actions. We know that we have already pasted the stamp on the envelope, but when we are about to throw the letter into the mailbox, we have to check it carefully again and again, pasting it again and again. There are indeed such people in the world who, when they put the letter into the envelope, are afraid of omissions, take it out and put it in, and carefully check it dozens of times, but the recipient still receives an empty envelope. Psychological abnormalities are diverse, strange and indescribable. If we do have the above-mentioned phenomena, then that is some kind of mental abnormality.

There are also some people who are called "neurotic" people. It seems that they have some kind of altered personality from heredity. Although the degree of alteration is different, the abnormal personality can be seen when they are not even teenagers. These people have a lot of intelligence 　and are particularly imaginative, but they have defects in emotion and will. Their emotions change very quickly, and their concepts of love and hate are not correct. Usually, they are always somewhat depressed. They lack patience, so they are prone to anger. When they are angry, they are extremely irritable, and they often feel regret afterwards. Although they are sometimes optimistic and even excessively happy, this time is extremely short. Their personalities mostly belong to "inwardness" (commonly known as narrow-mindedness), so they are extremely tolerant to themselves and very harsh to others. "Suspicion" is their characteristic, often unable to be at ease about a very small thing, or excessively worried about one thing and turning it into terror. They are prone to insomnia, often have nightmares, and sometimes have pessimistic and world-weary thoughts. If a person really reaches this point, then there is a risk of mental breakdown.

In short, there are many manifestations of the incubation period of mental illness, because we usually do not pay much attention to changes in emotions, so we ignore the danger of its incubation period. By the time madness breaks out, it is already serious and棘手. Therefore, the mental patients we see sent to the hospital for treatment are all those very noisy patients, and there are absolutely no preventive measures taken in advance. However, mental illness is not impossible to prevent, as long as we can patiently and constantly examine ourselves, prevent problems before they happen, and give initial treatment in the early stages, then it will not develop into a serious illness, so that even experts are helpless and regret is useless.

### The Battle Between Humans and Germs (II)

— Excerpt from "Infectious Disease Management" by Qiao Shumin

Foam Transmission - Respiratory diseases with symptoms of cough or sneeze are most easily transmitted to people through foam. However, foam transmission does not usually exceed a range of twelve feet. Furthermore, the size of the foam is clearly related to the amount of bacteria it contains. Larger foams can contain more bacteria, but also fall to the ground earlier; smaller foams have a longer range, but often contain fewer bacteria. According to an analysis of photos taken using high-speed photography by Mr. Jenning, each sneeze can eject an average of 20,000 foams into the air. The size of the foams varies. Among them, 80 percent have a diameter of less than 200 μm, and can float in the air, quickly evaporating into foam nuclei (Droplel-nuclei), drifting for hours or even days without falling; the bacteria they contain can also continue to live for noon days, and have the ability to transmit diseases. Generally, this type of foam transmission is quite common in places where the air is obstructed and densely crowded.

(II) Gastrointestinal Tract Transmission - Diseases transmitted through the gastrointestinal tract are very common in China. Unclean drinking water, food, and flies are the main media, often triggering epidemics. The epidemics can also have the following characteristics for identification.

1 Water Supply Transmission - Historically, there have been many records of epidemics transmitted through water supply, and there is no shortage of evidence that the epidemic was extinguished after water supply was controlled. In the past thirty years, European and American countries have paid great attention to water supply management, and have implemented centralized chlorine (or bleaching powder) disinfection of tap water. As a result, epidemics of gastrointestinal transmission have disappeared in Europe and the United States. Only in China, the cities with tap water before the war were only seventeen, and only seven of them implemented chlorine or bleaching powder disinfection. The countryside is even more out of the question. Therefore, gastrointestinal infectious diseases are prevalent everywhere, all year round. Cholera alone has been流行过 fifty-three times, and countless people have died from it—

In addition, raw and cold foods, ice products, swimming pools, etc., can all have the same transmission opportunities.

2 Milk Transmission - Milk is an excellent medium for culturing general bacteria. Therefore, in European and American countries that are accustomed to drinking milk, milk transmission is not limited to general gastrointestinal transmission. There are thousands of large and small epidemics of scarlet fever, diphtheria, tuberculosis, etc. Chinese people rarely drink milk, so it is not as serious as it is there.

3 Fly Transmission - Li and flies are thriving in summer and autumn. If feces and filth are not properly handled, flies will carry bacteria to food, resulting in the transmission of diseases, which is extremely common. The flies that transmit diseases are 99% houseflies (M.Domestica). This type of fly likes to gather on feces, filth, and food, especially foods containing sugar. Flies cannot digest protein or starch, and must vomit stomach acid to dissolve the sugar in the food, and then suck it in. The vomit can contain pathogenic bacteria. The infectivity of the bacteria contained in flies generally does not exceed forty-eight hours, and at most does not exceed five days. Sometimes flies can fly a distance of one thousand seven hundred bricks, but the bacteria they carry depend on the environment.

(III) Insect and Wound Transmission

1 Wound Transmission - Bacteria that invade wounds are either　gas　or　gas　属. The former are cocci, such as staphylococcus, of which streptococcus is important because it has a strong tendency to invade the blood stream from the lymphatic vessels; the latter is most important as tetanus bacillus.

2 Insect Transmission - Insect-transmitted bacteria are either刺入 through their beaks, or scratched or wiped in by human fingers, and sometimes enter through wounds. Generally, bacteria mostly originate from vertebrates; protists mostly originate from the insects themselves. Protists are quite different from bacteria, in that the former often have a "sexual reproductive history" as special. Parasites with the sexual reproductive stage are the final hosts, and parasites with the asexual reproductive stage are the intermediate hosts. Only after completing the sexual reproductive stage can they reach the asexual reproductive stage, and then they can be transmitted to the intermediate host. The time to complete the sexual reproductive stage is called the external incubation period, which is of no small importance to the management of infectious diseases. Infectious diseases with an external incubation period, the pathogenic microorganisms are mostly protists, but there are also filterable toxins.

The importance of the external incubation period can be said in two ways: first, the external incubation period can be regarded as a temporary safe period. If we discover the first case, then during this period, we can quickly extinguish insects to eliminate transmission? Secondly, the so-called external incubation period is the time when bacteria multiply and reproduce in the insect's body. This multiplication and reproduction must be subject to considerable restrictions from the external temperature, because insects are cold-blooded animals, and their body temperature rises and falls with the external climate. Not only the temperature is true, but also factors such as humidity, wind direction, and rainfall are not without relationship,详不

Now, assuming that a quantitative amount of bacteria (seeds) with infectivity and toxicity invades the human body (soil) through a suitable route (sowing), then whether an infectious disease occurs still depends on the fertility of the soil—the susceptibility or resistance of the human body—please discuss the soil.

Spring and Autumn

### Wishes

— Hua Lin

Wishes are like flying birds, crossing high mountains and raging seas, heading towards an infinitely distant future. Time forms the journey of history, but only wishes are forever ahead of history, displaying beautiful radiance!

Phidias, the solemn and sacred Athens, sculpts divine statues, incorporating the epitome of beauty of all the Greek men and women, adding his own patriotic zeal, adding his entire life, sculpting gods and sanctity, standing in the city of Athens, causing the youth of Greece to fall prostrate, with golden brilliance and dazzling colors. Even invading enemies crossing the sea would be frightened and bow before the divine statue!

Greek island—Greek island! Where are the Greek poets? Patriotic poems were transmitted the earliest! Byron and Goethe both worshipped Greece. The Greek religion transformed the nature of the universe into a beautiful life of grain and taught us to be intoxicated in the realm of nature. Gods do not leave people; gods are always very close to people. This beautiful illusion shrouds the ends of the sea and the edge of the land. "Wishes" forever fly forward without end!

This is poetic, this is scenery, this is the lingering sound of a song, lingering for three days!

Why, in the real world, have we lost our future, as if drifting on a boundless sea, losing direction in a daze, drifting with the waves, not knowing where we are going? Sicily, the island of hope, was invaded by Rome, and the Greeks were imprisoned. These prisoners, not slaves, all sang songs of freedom. The singing startled the seagulls on the beach, startled the eagles on the mountaintops, and together with the singing, they all flew up, moving the hearts of the Romans. They unlocked the shackles of the prisoners, and together they sang loudly. The song went straight into the sky. The Romans all said that they loved freedom, and we also love freedom; we are all one life!

A person who truly loves freedom also respects the freedom of others. If indeed the liberated zone has freedom, then what struggle can there be against the enemy? The Romans, in the song, joined hands with the Greeks, because in the rhythm of the melody, the blood is beating in the same way, and the breathing is equally passionate!

"Wishes" are in the endless future. It is like a flying bird, leaving traces of history on the edge of the world!

### On the Art of Dance

— Shusun Ruying

The art of dance is rarely cultivated in China today. Mr. Wu Xiaobang and Ms. Dai Ailian, who recently performed in Shanghai, are two of the most accomplished people among these very few, and they have added some precious brilliance to China's barren art scene. However, a vast China with only two dance artists is pitifully too few. Not only that, but in our country of ancient civilization, how many people can understand dance, understand dance, and appreciate dance?

What kind of art is dance? A deep discussion may require writing a book, but here, I would only like to paint a silhouette of the art of dance with a few hundred words.

Dance is a comprehensive art. First, it is the synthesis of time art and space art: it is not like a painting that allows you to see everything at a glance, nor is it like poetry that only appeals to your spiritual vision. It occupies space and occupies time at the same time; it moves in space within time. Second, it is the synthesis of music, posture, and movement: almost all dances are accompanied by complex (such as symphonies) or simple (such as drums and cymbals) music, and in movement and posture, the melody, rhythm, and interest of the music are expressed. Third, it is the synthesis of various artistic elements: all artistic elements such as lines, colors, shapes, rhythms, melodies, and poetic intent are included.

Therefore, a dance artist must first have a rigorously trained body. This rigorous training enables his body to accept subtle control. Every muscle must be able to relax as much as possible and also be able to stiffen as much as possible. A dancer's legs and arms must be able to bend and stretch slowly and change speed with any changing music. They must be able to kneel, run, and jump; all movements of the human body must be controlled within the constraints of music. Secondly, the dancer must understand music so that he can integrate his dance with the music. So-called dance is tangible music, solidified music; therefore, people who do not understand music enough cannot achieve higher achievements in dance. Again, all art cannot be separated from life, and dance is no exception. Dancers must understand life and have a deep understanding of life. Only then will their dance have content and meaning. Only those who can express the true meaning of life with technically perfect dance are truly great artists.

Ancient dances, whether in the East or the West, have the same characteristics. Their main purpose is to express human life. In ancient times, there was a kind of war dance, which was used to express heroic themes. Around the eighteenth century, dance had declined to the point of being restricted to the boudoir, with only some fixed movements and postures, emphasizing splendor and elegance. Thus, dance became a lifeless temple art, a toy for the enjoyment of a few. The revival of modern dance began with Ms. Duncan. Although her life's romantic deeds have caused some misunderstandings among our people, who have not abandoned Puritanical thinking, her achievements in the art of dance are truly indelible. She accepted all the techniques of classical dance, but these classical techniques were liberated in her hands. She began to dance barefoot and to use music that was not dance music. She was the first to use body movement and posture to express the thoughts and emotions of a living person. Thus, modern dance was born, and the art of dance was revived.

In China, modern dance was introduced by Mr. Wu Xiaobang and Ms. Dai Ailian. They not only introduced Western and Japanese modern dance, but also worked hard to explore and create Chinese folk dance. Ms. Dai's advocacy of folk dance naturally has its significance. May their cultivation not be in vain, and may people in Shanghai understand what the art of dance is from now on.

### On Imitation

— A Long

There seem to be quite a few people writing articles these days, which is very encouraging for the future of literature and art. However, after carefully reading newspapers and magazines, articles on plagiarism are often found. After a few days, rebuttal articles are published, and the literary world becomes very noisy. With the addition of cheering and shouting, it really becomes a full-scale martial arts performance.

And the result of this wonderful program is "no conclusion." The editor or a third party will write an article to mediate, and the way to mediate is not to say plagiarism, nor is it completely original, but only to be a little influenced, an imitation in style.

I quite agree with this view. I remember a few years ago, someone shouted the slogan "We need to accept literary heritage." This means that we absorb the essence of the ancients, and then we can create better works.

People are not born omnipotent. At first, they need to be supported by others, and they should learn and imitate the necessary actions in their own lives until they can use them freely and make a living on their own. And literature is the same, but we should not imitate rigidly, we should not plagiarize indiscriminately, and piecemeal plagiarism will lose its meaning.

Sholokhov's "Quiet Flows the Don" was influenced by Tolstoy; although Shaw's "The Adventures of the Black Girl in Her Search for God" has several places that imitate Voltaire, this is only imitating style and does not affect the overall value of the work.

As for some works that obviously adopt the plots of famous works, or even plagiarize the personalities created by others, this kind of internal imitation is like the work losing its soul. Things without a soul will naturally not contribute anything. Although we cannot definitively assume that the author used a certain popular famous work as a blueprint, this is always a flaw.

Here, I want to advise those who plagiarize: you should read more and experience more. In this way, unconsciously, you will get the valuable parts of those books and real life and melt them down. Afterwards, not only will it be easy to write, but the work will also be more successful.

### On the Decadent School in Art — Tolstoy's Theory of Art

— Liu Xianya

Art is impoverished in content because of the unbelief of the upper classes, and because it is becoming more and more special, it is becoming more and more complex, more incomprehensible, and more particular about appearances. Therefore, similar works of art are only for a small number of classes in special states, or only for the author and his followers—kings, dukes, princesses, etc. Such works of art do not express what is understood by the public, but only seek to be understood by those who are accustomed to ridicule. First, in this way, one can say more; second, this method of expression feels vaguely special and beautiful in the special class. This method is gradually used, and in the end, it becomes decadent art.

In decadent art, ambiguity often overflows in the works of art, so many poets commonly abide by this theorem. And there are many artists who, according to Nietzsche and Wagner, believe that what they do should not be understood by the foolish public, but should arouse the poetic state of educated people; this kind of person is called by British aestheticians—the best nurtured men.

At that time, the most respected among the decadents were Baudelaire and Verlaine. In their poems and prose works, we simply cannot understand their meaning. Now, let us copy Baudelaire's "The Stranger" as follows:

"Stranger, whom do you love? Your father, your mother, your brother, your sister?

I have no parents, no brothers or sisters. Your friends?

You use words whose meaning I still do not know. Your country?

I do not know in what latitude it is. Beauty?

If she were a goddess and immortal, I would be very willing to love her. Gold?

I hate him as you hate God. Alas! Strange stranger, what do you love?

I love the clouds... the passing clouds, the wonderful clouds..." What does this "stranger" mean? What is it all about? It really makes us completely incomprehensible. Therefore, we feel why so many artists in the decadent school respect Baudelaire and Verlaine.

As for Baudelaire's outlook on life, it is based on the crude "egoism" as a theory, replacing morality with the uncertain meaning of "beauty" and "the beauty of art." Baudelaire valued the made-up face of a woman more than the woman's original face, and valued iron trees and artificial mountains and rivers on the stage more than natural things.

Verlaine's outlook on life lies in withering dissolution, in acknowledging one's moral weakness, and in worshiping Catholicism to save its weakness.

They both lack truth, sincerity, and simplicity, and are full of hypocrisy, eccentricity, and self-esteem. But their theories still arouse the praise of many artists. What is the reason for this? Tolstoy said: To explain this phenomenon, one only needs one sentence: "The art that these poets' society needs is not a legitimate and important thing in life, but only a game."

In summary: good, great, universal art is not understood by only a small part of the bad class, but never by the majority of simple and clean working people. The reason why art makes the majority of people unable to understand it is because it is good. At the same time, it can also be said that the reason why art makes the majority unable to understand it is because it is not good, or it is simply not art.

Therefore, we know that the art of the decadent school is the "egoistic" and "incomprehensible" art; that is, what Tolstoy said is "not good" or even "simply not art." This question can also be expanded to the scope of popular art to discuss the problem of unpopular art.

Tune: Yu Meiren - Feelings on Journalists' Day - Hu Jianzhong

Ten years have changed the temples,
Yet my heroic spirit remains.
I have always been ashamed to seek titles,
Let my writings whiten my youthful head!
Tonight, we should all get drunk in the halls,
Wipe away the tears of Xinting.
Though heroic spirit remains, who can have much of it?
Faced with this vastness, how can we not get drunk?

### An Inch of Territory, an Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

"You are...?" A young waiter, wearing a cyan-blue cloth gown, came up to greet him. The hazy, clear light still reflected a deep red number "5" on his lapel, with four characters arranged in a neat semicircle above it, the larger ones being "XX Restaurant."

"Excuse me... It's too late, isn't it?" the man said with a smile.

"...There's still a small room on the sixth floor. Is that okay with you?"

"Good... There are only six floors here, aren't there? ...The higher, the better."

"Please, this way." the young man said, stepping aside and leading the way.

——The secret hand gestures and code words come to an end here.——

This building was originally a first-class hotel in Beiping. Since the counter-espionage work reached the expansion stage, this place became the North District Action Headquarters. The person in charge of the hotel was originally a strong revolutionary before, and the hotel was a superb cover for hiding dragons and crouching tigers, so setting up a headquarters here was quite appropriate. The ground floor to the fifth floor is still the ordinary hotel business. The entire sixth floor is the real place to issue orders, but it is arranged without a trace.

When I arrived on the sixth floor, I met Mr. W, the person in charge of the headquarters. At first glance, you can tell that he is an extremely capable, forthright, and extremely alert person.

"Welcome, welcome... On behalf of our bureau's highest person in charge and executive director, welcome, sir." His Mandarin had a heavy southern accent.

I also said a few polite words on behalf of Tsurumi; at the same time, I briefly explained the various troubles and dangers along the way from Changxin.

"What stage has the 'Seven Secret Keys' reached now?" Mr. W went straight to the point.

"The first plan is to decipher the contents, and then think of a way."

"Are you confident?"

"I'll try, but the risk is very high." I thought of the scene of Tsurumi's hasty departure.

"Da has made sufficient arrangements, right?"

"Of course, but the other side's arrangements are also very strict!"

"Mr. K..." Mr. W was considering how to ask; he was eager to know Da's background.

"Yes, a descendant of one of the active members of the Huanghuagang Uprising."

"Ah?" He looked at the watch on his wrist; "No wonder... So... "expressed surprise.

"There is no doubt about it... But the gentleman is the third person to know about this!" I very solemnly explained this key point.

"How did he himself confirm it?" He picked up the direct line telephone, "Sorry, it's getting late, we still have to meet Ms. Ji, don't we?" He said to me, "...Hello,...Prepare two cars, the second one fifty yards away." After putting down the phone, Mr. W pressed the first of a row of six wires.

"His father is Gu Yongchang," I continued to explain Tsurumi's background; "It can probably be found on the old Tongmenghui membership list. After the Huanghuagang Uprising, his parents both took refuge in Japan, living in the Nagasaki settlement. Less than a month later, a child was born. That is Gu Jun. At the same time, his mother passed away due to postpartum fatigue..."

At this moment, someone knocked lightly on the door twice. Without waiting for a reply of "Come in," the door was already open. A young man, wearing a very neat uniform, walked into the room and closed the door behind him; he saluted Mr. W.

"Please assign four comrades on rotation to the second car, maintaining a fifty-yard distance for alert." After Mr. W finished speaking, he raised his hand. The young man responded with "Yes," saluted, and turned to leave. His attitude was very solemn. From this point, I saw the good omen of China's rebirth.

### The Sugar Line

— Shao Fu

Osmanthus fragrance drifts, the autumn wind is easy, although the tail of the autumn tiger is strong, people's mood is after all heading towards freshness. Pleasant weather, harvest season, Shanghai is a city where consumption and production compete most fiercely. Eating, drinking, and having fun, thinking of ways to scam a ticket, all have to be prepared spiritually.

Every festival makes one think of sugar, regardless of whether it is Chinese or foreign. The reason is probably because sugar is sweet, and sweetness belongs to happiness. Mid-Autumn Festival requires a lot of mooncakes, which use a lot of sugar, so the meaning of the sugar festival is especially strong. Unfortunately, there are no stalls selling Liangxiang Kui chestnuts on the road yet. Obstacles to north-south transportation make us lack this good fruit to embellish the festival. It is really disappointing! And fried chestnuts are also a kind of food that needs sugar.

At this, we suddenly realize the seriousness of the recent sugar dispute and the reason why creditors are competing for sugar!

In front of every southern goods store, there are crowds of people reaching out and shouting, sometimes forming a line that extends for two or three kilometers. But the characters in this scene, what is expressed on their faces is not sweetness, but bitterness, not joy, but irritability. Yes, bitterness is pursuing sweetness, and irritability is pursuing joy!

Most of Shanghai's sugar comes from Taiwan. Until today, we are still eating the sugar that Taiwan stored in the past, which contains countless blood stains, but this is beyond the imagination of sugar eaters. It is said that most of the sugarcane fields in Taiwan are abandoned, and the yield next year will be quite problematic. In this case, the sugar line may have to be extended to Taiwan next year. Can everyone get a pound? It's hard to say.

Some people say, don't panic, Cuban sugar will come.

### One of the Seven Necessities: Buying Rationed Sugar

One evening, the neighbor, Mrs. X, came over to sit and chat. She said: "Mrs. X, there is rationed sugar for sale in the southern goods store today, 860 yuan per catty. The goods are exactly the same as the car sugar sold by the American goods peddlers on the road, and they are much cleaner than the white sugar sold in the southern goods store on weekdays. It is said that it will be rationed once every two weeks..." My younger siblings were all overjoyed to hear this.

A few days later, the news of the eighth and ninth periods of rationed sugar was indeed published in the newspaper: the retail price was 820 yuan per catty, and each person was limited to three catties, which was 40 yuan cheaper than what Mrs. X said that day.

At 1:00 p.m. on the 14th, I went to a southern goods store nearby to buy rationed sugar. I saw that there were already about 200 people lined up in a long snake formation. Thinking that there would definitely be no hope for me to buy it today, I immediately turned back home and told my mother: "It's too crowded today! Let's wait until tomorrow to buy it?"

The next day, I came home from work at exactly 12 o'clock. I said to my mother, "Leave me some rice so I can go buy sugar and come back to eat." As soon as I walked over, I saw that there were already seventy or eighty people in line! For this sugar that costs 820 yuan per catty, it is really cheap, so I lined up in order. There were suddenly a hundred or so people behind me.

The rationing time arrived. Those standing next to the counter at the front shouted, "Why don't you sell it when the time is up?" At first, the shop assistants replied, "Wait a moment." Later, after shouting too much, the shop assistants ignored them and did other business, some comfortably raising their heads and shaking their fans.

In the blink of an eye, it was 1:30, and sales still hadn't started! There was a clamor at the front, and those standing at the back were also making sounds of discontent. It was easy to hear a loud shout, "Everyone, stand in line and don't squeeze, sales are starting." So everyone was chest to back, back to chest, tightly pressed together like abacus beads. Everyone's chest and back were wet.

"Three catties, three catties..." Two or three shop assistants were busy: counting banknotes, giving change, weighing sugar, wrapping it up... Half an hour passed, and only twenty or thirty people had left. It would take an hour to get to me. At this time, I saw my younger siblings running over, "Brother X, mother told you not to buy it if you can't, go home and eat, because you have to go to work in three hours." But I had already been standing for two hours. Although it was stipulated that sales would stop at 3:00, there was still hope of buying it. It would be a pity to leave like this. So I said to my younger siblings, "Then you stand for me and bring back three catties."

In the evening, when I came home from work, the younger siblings said with a distressed look, "Brother X, we stood until 3 o'clock, and there were only seven or eight people left in front; who knew that the shop assistants said, 'Time is up, we'll sell it tomorrow.'"

The third day, I was sitting in the office thinking to myself, "I don't have much official business today, so I can speed up and finish it in a little over an hour; I might as well leave work early and take a half-day off in the afternoon to wait to buy sugar. Otherwise, tomorrow, the last day, the situation of buying sugar will definitely be more difficult." After making a plan, I left work early.

When I came home, my mother asked in surprise, "Why are you so early...?" I didn't wait for her to finish speaking and continued, "For buying sugar!" Looking at the watch, it was still a quarter of eleven, so I went to the southern goods store. Ah! There were even more people with better patience than me, and there were already more than ten people waiting.

Three hours of sunbathing was indeed a bit difficult to bear, but I finally walked home holding a bag of three catties of rationed sugar.

### Park

— Changpu

Although the season has entered autumn, the climate has still lingered around ninety degrees Fahrenheit for the past week. After dinner, because Shanghai's houses are crowded and there is no place to cool off, I wanted to stroll to the park, hoping to relieve the day's hard work.

After buying a ticket, I entered XX Park, which greatly disappointed me. The weeds in the park were ankle-deep, the horizontal bars of the deck chairs were falling off, and most of the green grass on the lawn was gone, revealing mottled patches of mud. I only saw many children with bare chests and no shoes kicking football on the lawn, so I knew the reason why there was no green grass on the lawn. Along the road, next to the trees, and next to the fences, many children were holding earthenware jars to catch crickets, which caused many of the neat bricks laid on the ground to turn over, the roots of the trees were exposed outside the mud, and the fences were broken. I walked to the flower bed and took a look. There were flowers, but they were actually a few wild dandelions and wild chrysanthemums decorating it. The swings and seesaws in the children's park were also just empty frames. There were originally many flowers and trees in the botanical garden, but now they are poorly pruned, so most of them have withered and are unbearable. When the wind rises, the mud and sand on the lawn without grass all fly up, so the park is covered with mud and sand, and people cannot be seen across the street, which scares me and I hurriedly escape.

I remember that the parks in Shanghai before the war were still quite well-maintained. Why are they so barren after the victory? Shanghai only has a few small parks. If they are allowed to become barren and not repaired, then Shanghai will become a metropolis without parks, which is a miracle in the world!

### Low Profile

— San Gong

Zhou Qi was formally reported for suing the Mass Nightly News. Yesterday, it was also reported that Chen Yonghui, who once served as a puppet official, was detained in the Zhongzi Prison for extorting money from Westerners. These two "clever people" can be said to have "lifted a rock only to drop it on their own feet." As the saying goes, "Cleverness may be defeated by its own ingenuity." Having made a mistake in the past, it is difficult to guarantee that there will be no mistake today. Is it really "one mistake after another"?

Recently, disputes have occurred one after another on trams. It is, of course, necessary to rectify the military discipline when soldiers beat conductors, but the poor attitude of some conductors towards passengers also seems to need improvement.

The "Miss" who bravely came forward has seemingly forgotten that her father is in prison. Therefore, some people say that this is in line with a traditional Chinese spirit—"placing righteousness above family ties."

Trams seem to be the exclusive property of passengers at the starting and ending points, because some of the stations in between are not stopped even though they are set up, and some are too crowded to board even when they stop. Is this what is called "seeing something through from beginning to end"?

### We Cherish Military Discipline

— Chong Zhen

Starting from the Beating of a Tram Conductor

We cannot remain silent when naval soldiers, in order to get the tram to stop before reaching the station, resorted to beating the conductor when their goal was not achieved. Moreover, they privately arrested the conductor, dragged him into the camp, and beat him severely, leaving Liang Guanghui on the verge of death. What kind of system is this?

We believe that the offending soldiers who have received training are underestimating discipline too much. "Military discipline is the lifeblood of the army." This is the true color of a soldier. Have they forgotten their true color as a result of training? Moreover, everyone knows that trams must stop at stations. Do they not even know this? We remember the achievements of the Navy in the War of Resistance Against Japan, and we look forward to the establishment of a new Navy, but this incident has severely affected the general respect and hope for the Navy. Although, the vast majority of naval personnel would not want the tram to stop before reaching the station and then resort to violence. It is somewhat comforting that Battalion Commander Ye Baoqi of the Navy regards military discipline as paramount and has firmly stated that the perpetrators, Zheng Fulin and others, have already been detained and will be handed over to the military court for trial. If the injured person dies as a result, the perpetrators will be executed. We believe that these words will definitely be fulfilled. Because the punishment of the perpetrators is not a kind of revenge, but a protection of the Navy's military discipline. We cherish the Navy. That is why we say this.

### There is an Answer

— Ting

Due to the tram conductor beating incident, I was reminded of something: Once, I ran to the Shanghai office of the × Army, because I wanted to submit my name card directly to the reception room (in fact, I had been there several times, always to the reception room), without greeting the guard first, so a guard relentlessly asked me, "Have you received any education?"

I did not answer at the time, but unexpectedly, someone has now volunteered to answer this question.

### Atomic Mooncakes

— Wen Yi

The Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching, and mooncakes are coming into season.

Yesterday, as I passed Sichuan Road, I saw a large advertisement posted at the entrance of a food store, with the words "Atomic Mooncakes" prominently written on it, along with phrases such as "sweet and delicious" and "thin crust, ample filling."

The United States invented the "atomic bomb," and we will also invent "atomic mooncakes." Everyone knows the power of the "atomic bomb," but the "atomic mooncake" is sweet and delicious. This is the mystery of the atom.

We are now in the "Atomic Era" and the "Glass World." Since atomic mooncakes have already been invented, we hope that "glass mooncakes" will also be available on the market.

### Admission Exam Miscellany

— A Person Who Has Been Through It

Having participated in the entrance examinations of Jiaotong University and Jinan University, I cannot help but write something down. I will write down what I think of below, regardless of order, and I ask the reader to forgive me.

The science subjects at Jiaotong University have always been difficult, but this year they were very easy. English, Chinese, history, and geography go without saying. But mathematics was really too difficult! Many people were fooled by the ease of the science questions on the first day, thinking that mathematics would not be very difficult, but the result was a big surprise. Many people left blank papers, and there must be many who got zero points even though they were able to do some of the problems.

Outside the examination hall, someone said, "The admission standards for the Jiaotong University entrance examination are getting lower every year." Someone else said, "Although there are many candidates this year, the admission standards will definitely not be raised, because the general scores are not very good." Whether or not this is accurate remains to be seen.

The Zhi Xing Service Department of Jiaotong University has made great contributions. When I took the Jinan University exam at Aurora University, when you were so thirsty that you had no choice but to buy fresh orange juice from the gatekeeper, thinking of the water supply at Zhi Xing, it was truly immeasurable merit!

One of the physics questions at Jinan University was to differentiate "which is a magnet and which is not a magnet" without using any iron tools. But the exam paper copyist wrote the word "which" as "ripe." At first, I thought I had to differentiate "which is a ripe magnet and which is not a ripe magnet." I couldn't help but secretly be startled.

Jinan University's mathematics was much easier than Jiaotong University's. There were a total of four questions (Jiaotong University had six). Two were on analytic geometry, one was on plane geometry, and one was on advanced algebra. But there are two things that can be discussed here: (I am fortunate enough to be able to solve them, so the following is not a complaint):

According to the admission brochure, the mathematics section for the College of Science only tests advanced algebra, analytic geometry, and trigonometry. Why wasn't trigonometry tested, but plane geometry was tested instead? As a result, many people—almost everyone—were not prepared. But then again, the questions were very easy. Anyone who had studied the three-sided plane geometry in junior high school should have been able to do it.

After the mathematics exam, the sports field was filled with voices of resentment. One student angrily said, "The person who set the questions is truly lacking in virtue!"

Someone said with emotion, "The questions at Jiaotong University were really satisfying. It would be worth it even to get zero points. The questions at Jinan University were neither painful nor itchy. You can do them, but you can't do them well."

University admission guides are almost in everyone's hands. The most common one is the thick book compiled by Yu Cheng. Almost no one brought textbooks. Students have also learned to speculate, only choosing shortcuts and not following the proper path. Is the trend of our country's education towards excellence or bankruptcy?

Strictly speaking, there are not the most students in Shanghai. For example, at this Jinan University exam, I saw many familiar faces who had also taken the Jiaotong University exam. I have a classmate who has already taken the exams for Southwest Associated University, Xiamen University, and Jiaotong University. He told me that many of his classmates have agreed to take the exams for Wuhan University, National Central University, Tangshan Jiaotong University, and Zhejiang University together. These ten or so people alone already require careful embellishment of their many 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　how can the number be a joyful celebration
