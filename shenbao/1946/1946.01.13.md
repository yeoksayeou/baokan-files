### The Third Meeting of the Consultative Conference Presumes Eight Members of the Inspection Team; Wang Yunwu, et al., Form a Group of Five

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 12th] The Political Consultative Conference held its third meeting this morning in the National Government Auditorium. Thirty-five representatives attended, including Sun Ke, Chen Bufu, Wu Tiecheng, and Zhou Enlai. Zhang Lan requested leave due to illness, and Chairman Jiang designated Member Sun Ke as chairman. First, Zhou Enlai, the representative of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), reported on the consultations regarding the summary of the talks between the government and the CCP, stating that he believed the consultations on the summary had a fundamental success because the general policy of peaceful nation-building had been decided upon, and many agreements had been reached on specific issues. For example, the second item of the summary of the talks concerned the decision to convene a political consultative conference, as well as matters such as the fundamental freedoms and rights of the people, and local autonomy. The nationalization of the military was also [agreed upon]. Zhou reiterated several points: (1) The CCP's belief in implementing the Three Principles of the People continues to strive for its realization and has not been interrupted by conflict. (2) They acknowledge Chairman Jiang's leadership position and remain steadfast. (3) They respect the Kuomintang's position as the largest party. (4) Since the War of Resistance Against Japan, they have recognized the National Government and have never attempted to disobey or overthrow it. This can be seen from the fact that there is no central government in the CCP-controlled areas. Shao Lizi, representing the government, reported that both sides had been sincere in their consultations from beginning to end and had made mutual concessions, but there were also areas where concessions could not be made because the representatives of both sides had their own positions. For example, in item 9 of the summary, the provision for the CCP's army to be reorganized into twenty divisions involved significant concessions from both sides. Shao also mentioned the efforts of Minister Zhang Zhizhong and Ambassador Hurley in the talks, which should not be forgotten. After Shao's report, the entire body unanimously passed the reports of Members Zhang Qun and Zhou Enlai from yesterday. A recess was then called, and government representative Chen Lifu, CCP representative [Mao] Biwu, Democratic League representative Liang Shuming, Youth Party representative Chen Qitian, and independent representative Wang Yunwu negotiated during the recess to nominate candidates for the military inspection team. After the recess, a report was presented, nominating He Jihong, Li Dequan, Lin Keji, Zhou Binglin, Wu Baozhen, Du Bincheng, Zhang Yuanshan, and He Guanqi as members of the team. Leng Shi, Zhang Xizhu, Ren Hongjian, and Lin Hu were nominated as alternates. Shao Congen, Yu Jiaju, Deng Xianchao, Chuan Sinian, and others spoke on the reports of the government and CCP representatives, all hoping to establish a permanent foundation for peaceful nation-building. Ye Jianying bid farewell to the representatives, saying that he would be going to Peiping soon to participate in the work of the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters and hoped to receive guidance. Lu Dingyi proposed the formation of a group of five, and this proposal was unanimously agreed upon, namely to elect representatives from the nominated inspection team to form the group, and to negotiate tomorrow morning. Tomorrow is Sunday, a recess. All parties can conduct off-site consultations. The fourth meeting will resume at 3:00 PM the day after tomorrow (the 14th). (The reports of Zhou Enlai and Shao Lizi will be continued in tomorrow's third edition.)

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 12th] The General Assembly will adjourn on the 13th and presume Wang Yunwu, Chen Qitian, [Mao] Biwu, Chen Lifu, and Liang Shuming. A group of five was formed to negotiate the agenda for the General Assembly on the afternoon of the 14th. The original budget for this General Assembly was 15 million yuan. It will probably not exceed that.

### The Government Will Accommodate All Parties; Military Conflict Will Cease Starting at Midnight Tonight; The Communist Army Will Be Reorganized and Reduced to Twenty Divisions

[United Press, Chongqing, 12th] Private sources say that the most likely cause of difficulty for the Consultative Conference is the election of a National Assembly and the reorganization of the government according to the proposals of the various parties. These issues are currently being discussed behind the scenes. A third possible cause of difficulty is the nationalization of the army. Formal discussion on this issue has not yet begun. The Democratic League has put forward three suggestions, namely, the separation of the army from the National Government, the reduction of the number of troops, and the formation of a committee composed of military and civilian representatives and American personnel to draw up detailed measures for the first two tasks. After the Political Consultative Conference closes on January 23, the government authorities will immediately take steps to reorganize the government and allow leaders of all parties, especially the Communist Party, to join the National Government Committee. This is the country's highest policy, and a new institution will be established to replace the wartime institution of the Supreme National Defense Council. The government will quickly re-appoint ministers of various ministries, whose sole purpose is to accommodate leaders of all parties, especially the Communist Party. The vice-chairmen and vice-mayors of provincial and municipal governments will also be rapidly appointed by the government. These positions can be held by Communist Party members and democrats. In some areas, the provincial chairman and mayor can be appointed by the Communist Party so that the Communist Party can simultaneously occupy a position in the central and local governments.

[Another Dispatch] Zhou Enlai revealed that the third meeting of the Political Consultative Conference agreed to form an inspection team composed of five political parties to investigate the truth in the conflict areas, so the two sides agreed to cease military conflict starting at midnight tomorrow. He went on to say that before the nationalization of the army is realized, the Communist army will begin to be reorganized and reduced to twenty divisions according to the plan of the Political Consultative Conference.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 12th] At the third meeting of the Political Consultative Conference on the 12th, the following resolution was made regarding the report of government representative Zhang Qun and CCP representative Zhou Enlai at the second meeting on the 11th regarding the negotiations on the cessation of military conflict and the resumption of transportation: "The members of this meeting, after listening to the report of Mr. Zhang Yuejun and Mr. Zhou Enlai on the negotiations on the cessation of military conflict and the resumption of transportation, are fully aware that both the government and the CCP are making the greatest determination to be patient and accommodating, so that military conflict will end and peace will be established. We are deeply gratified. We especially hope that following this agreement, measures to permanently eliminate military conflict will be implemented quickly. At the same time, we would like to express our deep admiration for General Marshall's enthusiastic support."

### Robinson Goes to Peiping to Establish Executive Headquarters

Zhou Enlai told reporters that each member has about 300 staff members. Colonel Barruder, Military Attaché of the U.S. Embassy in China, left Chongqing for Peiping today to prepare for the establishment of the basic affairs of the Executive Headquarters. Mr. Barruder may preside over the military command section of the headquarters. He came to Chongqing with Marshal Ma.

### The Peiping Pacification Headquarters' Organization May Expand

Merchants Hoarding Goods in Peiping and Tianjin are Strictly Investigated

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 11th] Li Zongren, Director of the Pacification Headquarters, said: The list of Chinese traitors in North China will be announced as soon as the arrests are completed. After a thorough investigation and inspection, they will be transferred to the court for trial. Currently, prices in Peiping and Tianjin are rising daily. In terms of treating the symptoms, the government has strictly investigated merchants hoarding goods and speculation. In the future, it will also explain the sources of materials to fundamentally solve the problem. He did not explain the existence or abolition of the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters, but as reporters know, the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters in all war zones will be abolished in the short term. In the future, the Peiping Pacification Headquarters may be expanded, with Sun Lianzhong and Fu Zuoyi as deputy directors.

### Yu Hanmou Returns to Guangdong; Xue Yue Arrives in Chongqing to Report on His Work

### Sun Yat-sen's Relics Found; Handed Over to Madam Sun for Safekeeping

### Kuala Lumpur Incident Resolved

[Central News Agency, Kuala Lumpur, 11th] The unfortunate conflict between British police and our liaison officer on January 3 has been resolved a few days ago. According to official sources, the incident was due to the mistaken identity of the Chinese liaison officer as an officer of the Anti-Japanese Army. The British police officer believed that the Anti-Japanese Army had been disbanded, so they should no longer wear military uniforms or carry weapons, and they did not know that there were also Chinese officers in Malaya. For this reason, the military funeral of Colonel Lin Mousheng will be held in Singapore on the 13th, so they are eager to reconcile so that there will be no regrets. In order to avoid causing unnecessary stimulation to the general public, it has been agreed that the details of the resolution of this incident will not be published.

### Grain-Paying Farmers in Southern Anhui Petition to Shorten Delivery Route

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] Due to the tight deadlines set by various counties for the allocation and purchase of military grain in southern Anhui, farmers are paying quickly, but the Ministry is unable to count it in time, resulting in mountains of rice piling up on the riverside in Wuhu. The farmers paying the grain are stranded on the Jianggan River, some waiting for as long as ten days, causing great suffering. Yesterday, representatives from Huaining and six other counties came to Nanjing again to request a reduction in the allocation and a shortening of the grain delivery route. It is reported that after receiving the report, the Executive Yuan has ordered the Ministry of Food to send capable personnel to Anhui to quickly count the grain in order to alleviate the people's difficulties.

### A Large Area of Conflict; Zhou Enlai Reports at the Request of Zeng Qi

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 11th] (Delayed) The second meeting was held at 3:00 PM on the 11th. Zhang Qun and Zhou Enlai reported on the cessation of hostilities and the resumption of transportation. Zeng Qi asked Zhou Enlai to explain the current conflict areas in order to check the implementation of the ceasefire order. Zhou Enlai stood up and explained that, according to materials from three days ago, the conflict spread to thirteen provinces and regions: Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, Shanxi, Shandong, Hebei, Henan, Hubei, Shaanxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Guangdong, and Zhejiang. The most intense conflicts are currently near Chaoyang in Rehe, north of Nankou, and near Gubeikou. In Shanxi Province, it is near Datong and in the southern section of the Tongpu Railway. In Shandong, it is in the suburbs of Jinan and on the Jiaoji Railway. Other areas include northern and eastern Henan, northern Jiangsu, eastern Zhejiang, the border between Hubei and Henan, the northern section of the Jinpu Railway, along the Yuehan and Guangzhou-Kowloon Railways, and Hainan.

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 11th] (Delayed) During the discussion of the agenda of the General Assembly, Liang Shuming proposed that it should include matters related to the ceasefire, how the summary of the talks between the two parties should be implemented, relief and rehabilitation, a common program of governance, open government, nationalization of the army, and the National Assembly of the Constitution, but it was not passed. The Secretariat also scheduled the origin of the summary of talks on the 12th and presumed the military inspection delegates.

### Six Hours After the Ceasefire Order Was Issued, There Was No Gunfire in Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, and Henan; Bai Chongxi Left Bengbu for the Jinpu Railway to Inspect

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] Deputy Chief of Staff Bai left Bengbu yesterday to inspect the Jinpu Railway line. Six hours after the General Headquarters of the Army issued the ceasefire order, no gunfire was heard in the positions of the National Army in Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, and Henan. This is because the combat actions taken by the National Army in the past to complete the two major tasks of accepting surrender and protecting the return of refugees were mostly defensive, and their posture was defensive from beginning to end. In addition, the National Army has a more dense communication network, so once the ceasefire order is issued, it is implemented immediately. It is reported that the Communist Army southwest of Peiping was still taking action as of 10:00 PM today. The National Army is abiding by the order of the Commander-in-Chief with great patience. Also, at Dengjiatun, 50 li from Caozhou in western Shandong, a team of Communist troops surrendered to the National Army's Zhang Division with their weapons yesterday. The National Army had just received the ceasefire order and shook hands with the surrendered Communist officers and soldiers, posting a paper as a good news of the first handshake between the Kuomintang and Communist armies after the ceasefire order was announced.

Li Zongren's Speech

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 11th] Director Li Zongren met with reporters from this newspaper at 9:00 AM this morning and said: I read in the newspaper that the order to cease conflict has been issued, but the official order has not been received. I will obey the order and handle it. To be honest, China's own problems should be solved by ourselves. It is really embarrassing that the United States has to come out and mediate! The following are Director Li's answers to reporters' questions. Question: Where are the current conflicts? Answer: The National Army in North China is still deploying and has not moved. The current situation is that the Communist Army is destroying railways and the National Army is covering the repair of the road. Question: Where is the railway destruction the most severe? Answer: The Peiping-Hankou, Tianjin-Pukou, and Peiping-Suiyuan Railways are all severely damaged. Question: The ceasefire order does not seem to include Rehe and the nine northeastern provinces, does it? Answer: That's right! Rehe is not considered part of the nine northeastern provinces. Question: So, are General Du and Chairman Liu's military and political advances restricted by this order? Director Li did not explain this question because the military affairs of Rehe are now under the command of the Northeast Pacification Headquarters. Question: When can the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters be established in Peiping, and what are the candidates? Answer: I don't know.

[Associated Press, Tianjin, 12th] The order for the Kuomintang and Communist parties to cease conflict has been widely spread throughout North China today and is widely welcomed. It is generally believed that this is a turning point in the overall situation in China. However, some parties still have doubts and believe that the characteristics of the order will be seen when the National Army attempts to enter Zhangjiakou. According to the ceasefire agreement, the National Army can enter the Northeast to establish Chinese sovereignty. These troops can travel north of the Great Wall to Zhangjiakou. It is rumored that some troops are already on the way. It can be asserted that a large number of troops will travel to the Northeast in the future.

[United Press, Tianjin, 12th] After the issuance of the ceasefire order between the Chinese government and the Communist Party, military affairs in North China have actually come to a standstill. The Communist army, which had been moving towards Zhangjiakou for the past few days, has recently turned back to Shandong, but it is said that the Communist army is intensifying its activities there.

### Chuan Sinian Shouts "Unacceptable"; Liang Shuming Storms Out

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 11th] (Delayed) (1) Lei Zhen reported that as of noon today, only two proposals have been received from the Youth Party. Chuan Sinian shouted, "This is too disappointing for journalists. The parties have plans, but they are not taking them out early, which is really unacceptable." (2) The demand for the audience is still endless. The person in charge said that today they realized that the reporters stationed in Chongqing from the newspapers outside the area also came flying from the sky and drilling from the ground. (3) At 5:30 PM, the national flag was lowered at the National Government, and when the national anthem was heard, the audience stood up, but unevenly. (4) Chuan Sinian said that discussing the agenda without seeing the proposal is like choosing a bride before having a son. (5) The Democratic League proposed eight agenda items, while Zhou Enlai still adhered to the two principles of the peaceful nation-building plan and matters related to the convening of the National Assembly. (6) Liang Shuming spoke the most times today and had a verbal battle with Zeng Qi. Zeng Qi was polite, but Liang was impulsive and stormed out of the venue many times. (7) When Zhang Yuejun and Zhou Enlai reported, the hall was filled with the sound of papers colliding. (8) Seeing that there was disagreement on the Yi Cheng, Wang Yunwu wrote to each party to inquire about their opinions, and then claimed to have a small consultation, advocating discussing military affairs, politics, the National Assembly [draft] constitution, and other five items, but there was no small result. (9) Zhou Enlai explained that the parties involved in the Kuomintang and the Communist Party said: The Kuomintang has more party members, but party members are not necessarily those in charge. All Communist Party members are those in charge. (10) Zhou Enlai said: The Communist Party has always advocated unconditional cessation of conflict, but insists that the Communist army occupy Dolun and Chifeng. (11) Seeing that the members were eager to speak, the Secretariat specially sent oranges and candies, and the reporters also got to taste the leftovers.

### Zhou Enlai's Report at the Second Meeting: Lessons Learned from Experience - Three Principles for Unconditional, Swift, and Open Problem-Solving

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 11th] At the second day of the Political Consultative Conference, Member Zhou Enlai, following Member Zhang Qun, reported on the negotiations to cease military conflict, as follows:

Chairman, esteemed colleagues, concerning the progress of negotiations on ceasing military conflict and restoring all transportation, Mr. Zhang Yuejun has just provided a concise summary. Now that the ceasefire order has been issued and the ceasefire issue has been resolved, it is no longer the main subject of current consultation. Therefore, there is no need for me to elaborate on the details. However, should any of you have any questions, I will answer them to the best of my knowledge. I would now like to briefly share some lessons learned from the negotiations as a reference for the Political Consultative Conference in resolving all issues. The first lesson is whether the ceasefire negotiations should be conditional or unconditional. Domestic warfare, regardless of its cause or origin, is considered unfortunate by all. Everyone agrees that there should be no internal conflict during the War of Resistance against Japan, and that after the victory, the nation should be built peacefully. This is not only the consensus of the people but also the hope of the Allied nations. To successfully negotiate a ceasefire, it must be done without conditions. If conditions are debated, a resolution will not be reached. In the initial negotiations, the other side focused on arguing about ceasefire conditions, ultimately delaying the resolution of the issue. On one occasion, friends from the Democratic League invited representatives from both the government and the Communist Party for discussions. Mr. Huang Renzhi said, "Negotiations to stop the civil war should involve an unconditional ceasefire." We were deeply moved and believed this was a good approach to addressing the problem. Inspired by this, upon returning to Yan'an and obtaining the consent of the Central Committee of our Party, the CCP delegation came to Chongqing and proposed an unconditional cessation of internal conflict. This led to a result in the Three-Man Committee negotiations, ultimately resulting in the issuance of the ceasefire order. There is an additional point to clarify: in the Three-Man Committee, I reserved all the demands that we originally intended and should have made. We accepted all reasonable conditions proposed by the government side and made as many concessions as possible regarding those that could be considered. The cessation of conflict should, of course, be unconditional. The conditions reported by Mr. Zhang Yuejun are not additional conditions for the cessation of conflict but additional conditions for the cessation of movement. The cessation of conflict should be comprehensive and unconditional. We agreed to exceptions for justifiable troop movements, such as the government's need to reorganize its army south of the Yangtze River, which would necessitate some troop movements, and the government's need to send troops to the Northeast to take over national sovereignty. Only the third point, regarding Yi County and Duolun, was unacceptable to us because the CCP-led troops were already there taking over and stationed there. Ultimately, the government dropped this demand, which pleased us greatly, and a resolution was finally reached.

The second lesson is that problems the entire nation urgently expects to be solved should be solved immediately rather than delayed. We believe that decisive action should be taken. For example, the issue of civil war is opposed by the whole country and disapproved of by the world. Since all parties recognize that it is unfortunate, it should be resolved quickly. Mr. Zhang Yuejun has already said that every day the war is prolonged, the people suffer for another day. Yesterday, Mr. Que Mingshu cried and spoke out for the people, demanding that we resolve the issue immediately. This kind of delay, regardless of its cause or origin, is a lesson in problem-solving. By yesterday morning, the problem was resolved, and everyone was very happy, but we, the parties involved, should recognize that this is a matter of regret.

The third lesson is whether the negotiation method should be open or secret. Since a matter concerns the entire nation, the lives and property of 450 million people, the fate of the country, and even the concerns of the entire world, why should it be kept secret? Moreover, this matter involves the bloodshed of millions, so why should it be kept secret? Therefore, to resolve this problem, efforts must be made among a small number of representatives, but the matter should be made public. The resolution of this ceasefire issue, although handled by representatives from both negotiating parties and ultimately facilitated by General Marshall's support, was truly driven by the people's demands and the urging of public opinion. Because of the people's demands and public opinion, the world paid attention, leading to announcements from U.S. President Truman and the Council of Foreign Ministers. All of this public pressure created the momentum for resolving the issue. Therefore, we believe that any matter concerning the nation, the people, and the people can be made public to obtain public opinion. Understanding public opinion can lead to a standard for resolving the issue. Therefore, in the agreement reached between the government representatives and the CCP representatives, it was unanimously agreed to include a third item: the National Political Consultative Council and the National Assembly would each appoint eight impartial individuals other than the parties involved from the KMT and the CCP to form a military inspection team that would visit various locations to investigate with representatives from both the KMT and the CCP. Some people think that now that the war has stopped, the role of the military inspection team has been completely lost. In fact, as many newspapers have said today, this is only the first step of the beginning. To truly stop all military conflicts without exception and to fully restore all transportation without exception is a difficult project. The ceasefire order has been issued, and the ceasefire will take effect on the 13th. Major conflicts will stop completely, but minor disputes in areas where the order has not yet reached and in many blockaded areas will need to be resolved. Therefore, the supervision of the cessation of all military conflicts and the restoration of all transportation depends on the investigation and supervision of the military inspection team and its ability to offer opinions. Therefore, from past experience, we have learned that matters concerning tens of thousands of people and the people should be made public, as this is beneficial. The above three points are the lessons we have learned from resolving these issues. In summary, if we can all recognize the three methods of unconditional ceasefire, rapid resolution, and public disclosure, we can seek a solution sooner, reduce public criticism, and reduce international condemnation. This is an unfortunate situation, and it is hoped that all future issues can consider these principles, especially the second and third principles, which should be taken as a lesson. This is the first part of my report. "To be continued"

### Soviet Representative's Motion Ultimately Rejected

[Reuters, London, 12th] At the United Nations General Assembly today, the Soviet representative proposed a motion to postpone the election of the six non-permanent members of the Security Council, which was rejected after a roll-call vote, with 34 votes against, 9 votes in favor, and 8 abstentions. This motion was proposed by Soviet representative Andrei Gromyko at the beginning of the meeting today, opposed by U.S. delegation head Secretary of State Byrnes, and not allowed to wait for British Foreign Secretary Bevin to stand up to speak for Britain on the election matter, because only two people were allowed to speak for or against the Soviet motion. Bevin then indicated that Britain opposed the Soviet motion. The four countries allowed to speak on the motion were the United States and Costa Rica in opposition, and the Soviet Union and New Zealand in favor. After the vote, the countries that supported the Soviet motion were: the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Finland, Czechoslovakia, Belarus, New Zealand, Australia, Denmark, and Norway. The countries in Latin America, the Middle East, and Western Europe, including Britain, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, opposed the postponement of the election. Gromyko explained the Soviet motion, saying that the election of non-permanent members of the Security Council was undoubtedly a very important issue, and that some representatives had only arrived in London three or four days ago and had no sufficient time to discuss this issue with other representative countries, nor to discuss this election issue with other governments, so the Soviet delegation decided that the election should be postponed until the end of next week. When Byrnes spoke, his tone was high and clear, interspersed with gestures to assist his tone, and the hall was silent, listening attentively. Byrnes warned the representatives not to allow this "precedent that will undermine the future work of the General Assembly." He said that this was not a matter of convenience or inconvenience, but of preventing the delay of agreed-upon work at the request of one representative. Soviet Ukrainian delegation head Manuilsky proposed that the distribution of non-permanent seats on the Security Council be as follows: two seats for Latin American countries, which he proposed be filled by Brazil and Mexico; one seat for South Pacific countries, which he proposed be filled by New Zealand; one seat for Eastern Europe, which he proposed be filled by Poland; one seat for Middle Eastern countries, which he proposed be filled by Egypt or Saudi Arabia; and one seat for Scandinavia, which he proposed be filled by Norway.

### Preliminary Work of the General Assembly Completed: Important Stage - Committees Elect Chairmen

[Reuters, London, 11th] The United Nations General Assembly elected the chairmen of the various committees yesterday afternoon, taking on the liaison work between the various councils of the General Assembly and the General Assembly, and the preliminary work of the United Nations organization has now completed another important stage. Reliable sources believe that the British representatives' tasks in the various committees of the General Assembly have been assigned as follows: "Political Security Committee" Foreign Secretary Bevin, Minister of State Noel-Baker; "Economic and Financial Committee" Noel-Baker, Deputy Secretary McNeil; "Social Welfare and Cultural Committee" Minister of Education Wilkinson, Deputy Undersecretary Henderson; "Trusteeship Committee" Deputy Undersecretary of the Colonial Office Jones; "Administrative Budget Committee" Financial Undersecretary Hall, Labour MP Young; "Legal Committee" Attorney General Shawcross, Henderson. As for the British candidate for judge of the International Court of Justice, it is believed to be Sir Michael Nayar, a prominent British international jurist. Soviet Ukrainian delegation head Manuilsky was unanimously elected as chairman of the Political Security Committee after being nominated by Chinese delegation member Gu Weijun. This is one of the most important committees, serving as a liaison between the General Assembly and the Security Council. Issues such as atomic energy and its control will be handled by the Security Council. The other committee chairmen are as follows: "Social Welfare and Cultural Committee" New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser; "Trusteeship Committee" Uruguayan delegation head and Uruguayan Ambassador to the UK Macegan; "Administrative Committee" Syrian delegation head Shuli; "Economic and Financial Committee" Iranian Foreign Minister Rimoski; "Legal Committee" Panamanian delegation head Geminis.

### Establishment of Credentials Committee: Executive Secretary Position, Our Representative Elected as Committee Member

[Central News Agency, London, 11th] At this morning's plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly, China, France, Belarus, Haiti, Paraguay, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Denmark were elected as members of the Credentials Committee, with Denmark serving as the chairman of the committee.

[Reuters, London, 12th] The two hundred and fifty representatives of the United Nations General Assembly, who met all day yesterday, although tired, gained a great deal. The morning meeting passed the agenda of the General Assembly, appointed six committees to accept the reports of the Preparatory Committee, established the Credentials Committee, authorized the Executive Secretary to temporarily act as Secretary-General, and debated two issues. Fortunately, Chairman Spaak was capable and talented, so he was able to quickly complete various tasks. This agency's diplomatic reporter said that one of the issues debated yesterday morning was the Cuban representative's proposal to limit the powers of the Standing Committee. The Standing Committee is no less than the guiding committee of the General Assembly. During the San Francisco Conference, some people also tried to protect the sovereignty of the General Assembly with a jealous attitude. The amendment proposed by the Cuban representative refers to the Review and Reporting Committee. All American countries, except for greater Canada, supported the Cuban motion, advocating limiting the term of the committee to one week.

[Central News Agency, London, 12th Special Dispatch] After Chuan Bingchang and Jin Wensi arrived here today, the members of our delegation attending the United Nations General Assembly, numbering thirty-six people, have been completed. All the representatives held their first meeting at the Chinese Embassy in the UK this afternoon. Our chief representative, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, was unable to come to England due to attending the domestic Political Consultative Conference, so Dr. Gu Weijun concurrently serves as acting chief representative. The other representatives are Fu Bingchang, Qian Tai, and Zhang Pengchun. Hu Shize, Jin Wensi, and Liang Long are deputy representatives. The delegation's advisors include Xu Shuxi, Sa Bendong, Guo Youshou, Liang Yunli, Ye Gongchao, Zhang Zhehang, Zhang Dechang, and Shi Siming, a total of eight people. The entourage includes Liu Xuancui, Ren Qishen, Zhai Fengyang, and Tao Yin, a total of four people.

### Gu Weijun: Most Reputable

[Central News Agency, London, 11th] It is generally believed that our country's acting chief representative, Gu Weijun, is the most reputable representative at the United Nations General Assembly. Among the representatives of various countries, Gu is the only one who has served as the chief representative of the old League of Nations. Although some other representatives attended the League of Nations, they were generally only representatives or secretaries. William, the hall messenger of the General Assembly Hall, has served as the hall messenger of countless international conferences, and his knowledge of the representatives of various countries is greater than anyone else's. Yesterday, when the General Assembly opened, a reporter from the Daily Mail asked who was the most reputable among the representatives of various countries, and William replied without hesitation: "Dr. Gu Weijun of China." This William, who has served as a hall messenger for forty years, also said, "Chinese representatives are generally courteous."

### The Tatar Strait Issue: Will Be Submitted to the General Assembly for Discussion

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 11th] According to sources close to the State Department, Secretary of State Byrnes will raise the difficult issue of the Tatar Strait at the plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly. It is said that the United States' position on this issue has not changed, and it still maintains the views held in the document from the government to the Turkish government in November of last year. In this document, the U.S. government urged that this issue be resolved on an international basis. These people said that the United States supports resolving it through diplomatic negotiations within the framework of the Montreux Convention, with the participation of the United States, and then submitting it to the United Nations organization. They also said that Washington, in view of the recent territorial disputes between the Soviet Union and Turkey, clearly does not want to adopt an attitude that could be seen as favoring either country.

### Eisenhower Has No Intention of Assuming the Post of Secretary-General of the United Nations

### Prime Minister Shidehara barely survives: Cabinet reshuffle completed, five new cabinet members scheduled to take office this morning

[United Press, Tokyo, 12th] It is reported that the Shidehara Cabinet has completed its reshuffle today. The six resigning cabinet members have been replaced by five new cabinet members, so that the government maintains its conservative and non-partisan nature. The new cabinet members are scheduled to take office in the Imperial Palace tomorrow, but they must first obtain permission from the United Nations Command. The new cabinet members will remain in office until the election. The list is as follows:

(1) Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Soejima, 64 years old, former Chairman of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, and has held important positions in the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. (2) Minister of Home Affairs and Minister of Transport and Communications Misa, 74 years old. (3) Minister of Education Abe, 65 years old. (4) Chief Cabinet Secretary Narahashi, transferred from Director of the Cabinet Legislation Bureau. (5) Director of the Cabinet Legislation Bureau Ishiguro, 42 years old, former Director of the Ministry of Home Affairs. (6) Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Tagiri, 49 years old, former Minister to the Philippines and Counselor of the Embassy in China. All other cabinet members, including Cabinet constitutional expert Dr. Matsumoto, have remained unchanged.

[United Press, Tokyo, 11th] Sources in political circles announced today that five cabinet members submitted their resignations at yesterday's cabinet meeting, and replacements are currently being sought, but MacArthur's approval must be sought before appointments are made.

It is said that Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Matsumura and Minister without Portfolio Tsuda strongly urged Shidehara to reshuffle the cabinet and not resign en masse. Both have submitted their resignations. It is said that the other three resignees are Minister of Home Affairs Horikiri, Minister of Education Maeda, and Minister of Transport Tanaka. All five resigned voluntarily, so that Shidehara would not be forced to resign due to the past activities of these people. Minister without Portfolio Matsumoto, former president of the South Manchurian Railway, was also affected by MacArthur's instructions, but since Matsudaira is currently the chairman of the Cabinet Committee on Constitutional Revision, he may be asked to remain temporarily.

### Reason for Delay in Delivery of Japan's Declaration of War to the United States

[United Press, Tokyo, December 12] Former Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Nomura, stated to a United Press reporter today: The coded telegram of Japan's declaration of war against the United States was received by the Japanese Embassy in Washington two and a half hours before the attack on Pearl Harbor. However, due to the embassy's inefficiency, it was delivered late. By the time Nomura and Special Envoy Kurusu delivered the telegram to the State Department, it was about an hour after the Pearl Harbor attack. At that time, US Secretary of State Hull was greatly angered and, after reading the lengthy telegram, told the two of them, "It is incomprehensible that any country in the world could send such a nonsensical document."

### Twenty-Two Dwarfs to Film New Movie

Amusing Incident Amidst a Housing Shortage

[United Press, Hollywood, December 11] Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) is hiring twenty-two dwarfs to play roles in the film "The Three Stooges." Unexpectedly, due to the severe housing shortage in Los Angeles, they could not find accommodation. MGM Studios had to take matters into their own hands and added a kitchen to each of the seven actors' dressing rooms, with three people living in each room. However, there was still one dwarf with no place to live. Emerson, the manager of the studio's zoo, wrote a note to the supervisors, saying, "I heard you have a dwarf lacking housing. I wonder if the kangaroos can help you?" This is also an amusing incident amidst the housing shortage.

### US Economic Experts Observe World Trade Trends

[United Press, Washington, December 11] Government economic experts have recently raised two major issues regarding world trade trends after 1946: (1) Can the United States produce enough goods to meet the needs of the entire world? (2) Can foreign countries affected by the war obtain US currency to purchase American goods? Economic expert Kelly of the Department of Commerce commented on the world market awaiting US exports: "There is virtually no American product that cannot be sold. The types and quantities of goods needed by foreign countries include almost all food, raw materials, consumer goods, and production tools. The urgency and breadth of this demand are hard to imagine. In some countries, people have not added new clothes for five years, and the urgency of their need for textiles is conceivable. Other urgently needed items, such as [missing character], railway materials, machine tools, farm implements, lumber, etc., are merely a small part of the total." Kelly predicted that in 1950, US export trade would reach $10 billion, including $4 billion in exports to the United Kingdom annually, and $2 billion in exports to Latin America annually. The remaining exports to Mexico, Cuba, Brazil, Argentina, Australia, the Union of South Africa, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Italy would be between $200 million and $300 million annually. The total US exports in 1944 amounted to $14.3 billion, including $11.3 billion in materials exported under the Lend-Lease Act, and $3 billion in commercial exports. The total exports in the first nine months of 1945 amounted to $8 billion, including $5.2 billion in Lend-Lease exports and $2.8 billion in commercial exports.

Assuming that the United States can manage to supply the needs of the huge world market, whether foreign countries have the ability to pay remains a question. Currently, only about ten countries in Latin America have a large surplus, but their purchases of American goods are also limited. Foreign countries without surplus funds have only three options: (1) Borrow from the United States, (2) Sell goods to the United States, (3) Provide tourism services. If the United States wants to continue to maintain a high level of exports, it must import as many foreign goods as possible. Only in this way can foreign countries obtain US currency to purchase American goods. Therefore, the urgent task for the United States is to raise the domestic economic level so as to create a large domestic import market. The total US imports in 1945 amounted to $3.5 billion. According to the US Department of Commerce, the total imports in 1946 will increase to $5.2 billion.

### Thirty-Five Thousand British Troops to be Stationed in Japan Shortly - Auchinleck to Inspect Troops in India

### US National Telephone Workers Began General Strike the Day Before Yesterday - Long-Distance Calls Also Interrupted Yesterday Morning

[Reuters, New York, December 12] US national telephone workers began their strike at 7:00 AM yesterday (New York time, 8:00 PM Friday Shanghai time), bringing national telephone traffic to a standstill. A Labor Department spokesman said that if the labor unrest continues to expand and completely shuts down the nation's telephones, the government will take over the telephone company. Members of the Traffic Communications Equipment Workers Association began blockading the New York office of American Telephone and Telegraph Company at 7:30 PM yesterday (Shanghai time), and telephone traffic was quickly affected. When this agency's New York bureau inquired with the telephone company via teletype, they were told that only emergency calls could be accepted at present, and transatlantic telephone service was also affected. The operator explained, "Due to a labor dispute, I cannot connect you." In addition to New York, large cities such as Washington, Chicago, Detroit, and Philadelphia also have workers implementing blockades. Telephone union president Weaver previously announced that the strike would be postponed until Monday, but has now withdrawn that statement due to the union's failure to lift the blockade. (According to a New York radio station, the latest news is that the telephone shutdown is unavoidable, and long-distance calls have also been interrupted this morning.)

### Einstein Discusses the Jewish Question

Points to Britain's Divide-and-Rule Policy in Palestine

[Reuters, Washington, December 12] Jewish scientist Albert Einstein, the inventor of the theory of relativity, told the British-American Palestine Investigation Committee today: Although I have never publicly advocated the establishment of a Jewish state, I feel that allowing Jews with nowhere to live to immigrate to Palestine is not against the laws of nature. Jews in Palestine can live together like relatives and friends. I believe that most of the Arab opposition is created by the British. When the British-American committee asked Einstein if he was unaware that Britain, as the mandatory power, would have to use force if it intended to allow Jews to immigrate, Einstein said that if the Arab opposition was not due to instigation, it would not be necessary. Einstein further said that he personally felt that Britain's colonial policy in Palestine was promoted by collusion between British officials and the local "Quisling faction," and other evidence also pointed to this. Britain is known for being good at creating trouble, and he personally felt that Palestine was no different from a small India.

### Rare and Exotic Fruits from Thousands of Miles Away Can Be Delivered Fresh to Your Doorstep - Air Transport Makes Ideal a Reality

[United Press, Kansas City, December 11] Rare and exotic fruits picked from the fields of Egypt or India on Monday morning can be delivered to Kansas City for lunch on Wednesday. This is an ideal of post-war commercial aviation, and may be realized within a year. If it really succeeds, it will be the result of two years of high-altitude flight experimentation. This experimentation began in 1943, when the US Department of Agriculture used an airplane filled with flowers, flying from Los Angeles to Reno, Nevada. In addition to staff from several airlines, a West Coast floriculturist was also on board. The purpose of the experiment was to determine the effect of high altitude and air pressure on various flowers, such as begonias, roses, gardenias, and orchids. At the time, the plane was flying at an altitude of 25,000 feet, where the outside temperature was almost -48 degrees Celsius. All the flowers were wrapped in absorbent wet paper, except for the orchids, which were tightly sealed in glass tubes. The passengers in the plane were wearing gas masks. When the plane arrived in Reno and the flowers were taken out for inspection, it was found that the roses had sprouted prematurely, and all the flowers except the orchids had withered. The sealed glass tubes seemed like small greenhouses, unaffected by the outside air pressure, so the orchids inside were still very fresh, like those displayed in a florist's window. Subsequently, researchers continued to experiment and finally came to the conclusion that any flower could be safely transported at a normal altitude of about 10,000 feet without wilting. After the flowers, fruits and vegetables were also tested. The first experiment was funded by a Kansas City grocer. Fresh spinach picked from the fields of California was loaded into an airplane and flown eastward overnight, and was displayed on the grocer's shelves for sale the next morning. Next, Indian plums, peaches, and other fruits were tested. Now, Heng, of Transcontinental and Western Air, and representatives from other companies are conducting other experiments. However, everyone's biggest ideal is to airlift food from the fields of India, Egypt, and other remote countries to the United States. As for when the ideal can become a reality, according to Heng, "Please wait six months. Once overseas air passenger service begins, we can deliver food from various countries to your kitchen."

### Symphony of Bustling Sounds and Harmony! Prelude to the Consultative Conference... Sketches of the General Members' Tea Party...

— Zhao Haosheng reporting from the wartime capital

Like a spring thunder in the first New Year after victory, Chairman Chiang announced on New Year's Day: The Political Consultative Conference will be convened on January 10. The people of the whole country are watching the holding of this conference with hope. For the past half-month, Chongqing's journalists have been revolving around this event with all their energy.

At 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 7th, all the representatives attending the Political Consultative Conference held a tea party to exchange opinions on general issues. The venue was the conference room of the Military Affairs Commission. A long rectangular hall, with roaring fires in the four corners, and sunlight shining through the green curtains, made people feel exceptionally warm. On the wall facing a row of long windows hung a large photograph of the chairman, and the chairman's handwritten motto "Propriety, Righteousness, Integrity, and Shame, the Four Pillars of a Nation..." In this solemn environment, holding this historically significant gathering, people felt exceptionally solemn.

Among the representatives, apart from Mo Dehui in the Northeast, Zhang Junmai in the United States, and Huang Yanpei and Zhang Lan absent due to illness, the thirty-four representatives present sat around a long table. On the table, two large antique porcelain vases were filled with plum blossoms and chrysanthemums, plus mimeographed documents, recording paper, representatives' briefcases, Guan Shengyuan's black tea, and long chopsticks, decorated a long conference table into a colorful pattern. A group of news reporters surrounded the sofas around them, using cameras and pen tips to accompany the representatives' conversations. The first person on the right was Secretary-General Lei Zhen, with a particularly large pile of documents in front of him. He first reported: The official opening date is 10:00 AM on the 10th, and it has been decided to invite Chinese and foreign reporters to attend. Twenty-three Chinese reporters and fifteen foreign reporters. The secretariat has prepared entry and exit permits. The conversation began.

Solemnly Assuming the Role of Temporary Chairman

Mr. Sun Ke

Shen Junru raised the issue of seating arrangements, believing that the representatives of each party could sit together according to the list published by the government. Mr. Fu Sinian, wearing a long robe, stood up and said in a very strong Shandong accent: According to Mr. Shen Junru's opinion, if the various parties sit together, then the non-partisan representatives may as well sit in the last row, because: "Originally, we are here to respectfully take the last seat." Thus, the issue was decided according to Mr. Fu's opinion. The representatives of the Democratic League had prepared various key points in advance.

Liang Shuming Reported on the Key Points Mr. Liang, wearing a gray robe and holding a large piece of paper recording the key points of the conversation, stood up and spoke. He first said that he hoped everyone would be more self-critical and self-motivated in order to create a harmonious atmosphere. Then he raised the issue of amending Articles 4 and 6 of the conference rules, as well as the implementation of various matters stipulated in the government-CCP meeting minutes.

Always Piling His Face with Smiles

Mr. Shao Lizi

Mr. Shao Lizi, smiling, this old gentleman stood up after Mr. Liang finished speaking and said in a sincere and kind voice: In order to make the conference proceed in a harmonious atmosphere, everyone should look forward to the future. The government's decision to convene this consultative conference is, in fact, willing to discuss state affairs with all parties. Regarding the implementation of various matters in the meeting minutes mentioned by Mr. Liang, Mr. Shao specifically recited the original text, explaining Mr. Liang's error in quotation. Finally, he said that the points mentioned by Mr. Liang should not have been raised in the conversation, and he expressed his regret for this.

Mr. Liang, with an attitude of taking the lead in self-criticism, said: "Shuming accepts Mr. Shao's words!"

Mr. Fu Sinian also felt that the amendment to the conference rules proposed by Mr. Liang should be resolved in the conference procedure. Regarding adding the word "responsible" in Article 6, Mr. Fu felt that the Political Consultative Conference was not an institution legally produced, but although it does not have the restraint of law, it has the great power of morality, and there is no need to worry that the government will not implement the resolutions. Regarding Mr. Fu's opinion, Mr. Liang also stood up and expressed his acceptance.

Regarding the agenda, the time of the meeting, and the voting rights, Mr. Zeng Qi, Mr. Miao Yuntai, Mr. Fu Sinian, and Mr. Zhou Enlai all spoke enthusiastically. Everyone felt that the easier to solve problems should be arranged in front, and the more difficult ones in the back.

Zeng Qi advocated more debate. Regarding the issue of meeting time, everyone felt that meetings should be held for half a day, and off-site consultations should be held for half a day, because many old gentlemen were afraid that their energy would not be enough.

When Miao Yuntai used "numbers" to explain the issue of voting rights, President Sun looked at him and said, "After all, it's a banker's point of view!"

Chen Lifu's temples were graying, but Mr. Chen's face was full of fresh vitality. He sat with Mr. Wang Yunwu, whose hair was gray, and talked from time to time. He often had to ask Mr. Zhou Enlai, who was sitting beside him, with whispers and slips of paper.

The thirty-four representatives communicated with each other in words of knowing everything and saying everything, and passed around plates of hot snacks. The whole room was full of warmth and harmony.

President Sun Stood Up Again

At that time, the sound of "Attention" suddenly came from outside, and in the distance, the music of the Military Affairs Commission raising the flag and playing the national anthem sounded. Then, everyone in the hall stood up in unison. This sound, representing infinite nobility and brilliance, vibrated heavily and solemnly. "One heart, one virtue, consistently from beginning to end..." Dr. Sun Yat-sen's instructions will resonate for thousands of years and shine with the sun and moon. In this solemn sound, those who are discussing national affairs today will feel a great inspiration.

Sun Xiaochang explained that the secretariat could handle the opinions raised by the representatives without question, and that issues would be formally submitted to the conference for discussion, and Minister Wang Shijie made some valuable suggestions to the reporters. Mr. Shao Lizi finally stated that because it was a consultation, the number of people could not be too large, and he hoped that those who asked to participate would forgive him!

When President Sun announced the adjournment of the meeting, it was already 5:15. Everyone rushed to the cocktail party held by the CCP in Shengda Building.

When Shao Congen walked out of the venue, a young lady waiting to take care of him came up to put a scarf on him, put on a hat, and helped him down the steps. Mr. Wang Yunwu's third son, Changtian, got married in the morning, and he still had some joy on his face. The prelude to the Political Consultative Conference ended in an extremely harmonious and pleasant atmosphere. A good start is half the battle. (Posted January 9)

News Reporters Surrounded... Mr. Wang Shijie

### New Scenery, Hot Atmosphere: A Day in Guangzhou

— By Our Guangzhou Special Correspondent, Liang Feng

One firecracker blast banishes the old!

What rises to take its place now is the clear and beautiful chime of the Yuehai Customs House clock, and the soul-stirring long blasts of steam whistles. In this quiet late night, the melody of the clock and the whistles resonates throughout the entire City of Five Rams. The former tells people that the "Victory Year" has arrived, and the latter, although signifying that from that moment on, vehicles and horses will keep to the right, this long, drawn-out鸣鸣 sound seems to possess a very deep meaning. The "all clear" signal shows that the intense, tense, and arduous era of the War of Resistance has passed. This is a victory cry, and also the first sound of Guangzhou welcoming the Victory Year.

Distinctive Symbol: National Flags Flutter on Lapels

The first thing that catches the eye on New Year's Day is the national flag flying everywhere. It flutters not only in the sky, atop the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, and in the streets and alleys, but also on people's lapels. It is a distinctive symbol. People are vying to buy a small national flag to wear on their chests. Perhaps you might ask, "What is this all about?" It turns out that this is part of a flag-selling fundraising campaign by the Guangdong community to celebrate the New Year's Day of the 35th year of the Republic and expand emergency relief efforts. Eighty teams of middle school students across the city are organized to solicit donations on the streets, offering a flag in exchange for any amount of money donated, but people usually donated one hundred yuan. If you don't have that "National Flag Pass," then you'll have to stop, and the children will surround you.

Releasing Eight Years of Depression: Six Hundred Thousand People Take to the Streets

If Guangzhou has a million people, then at least six hundred thousand were on the streets on New Year's Day. For eight years! They dared not say what they wanted to say, dared not do what they wanted to do. Today, they can laugh loudly and shout loudly. Faced with such a grand occasion, how could they not release the depression that has been suppressed for eight years, and not fully open their hearts? No one wants to stay at home. Everyone welcomes this first New Year's Day holiday after victory with exceptional excitement and joy. People are squeezing and squeezing, and the streets are almost impassable. From time to time, there are lion dance troupes organized by labor unions and martial arts associations passing by, one after another, bizarre and colorful, with gongs and drums filling the air, and the majestic lions dancing, attracting the attention of many passersby. The lions are surrounded by large crowds everywhere, causing traffic jams. The sounds of car horns and the shouts of rickshaw pullers are ignored as everyone watches the lions. This noisy and chaotic symphony highlights the even more lively atmosphere on the streets.

Vehicles and Horses Keep to the Right: Boy Scouts Fully Mobilized

In this bustling and noisy crowd, sometimes a small group of boy scouts walks by. They are truly lovable. They are neatly dressed and energetically walk with brisk steps. They are not idly strolling, but are responsible for helping to maintain traffic. Because it is the first day that vehicles and horses are keeping to the right, it is feared that drivers and pedestrians are not yet accustomed, causing traffic order to be disrupted. Therefore, police officers throughout the city, members of the Youth Corps, members of the city party department service team, and students throughout the city are participating in this supervisory work. In the light drizzle, they fully demonstrate their spirit of service.

Grand Exhibition: Satiating the Eyes with Enemy Military Items

The exhibition of historical relics of the War of Resistance and war trophies also opened on New Year's Day. Jiaozhong Middle School on Wende Road is more lively than usual, swallowing a large number of curious people. Those who have not experienced the baptism of gunfire can also go and see, so they can know how arduous our country's War of Resistance was. The venue is divided into three parts for the exhibition. The first part is items seized from the enemy military, including more than thirty kinds of various types of Japanese rifles, and more than a dozen types of light and heavy machine guns. There are also communication equipment used by the enemy military, large and small wireless radios, telephones, 愛排,雙　搜搬蠶的會令　令教範日記文件, all of which are valuable items. The enemy military's equipment is also neatly displayed, such as enemy military uniforms, shoes, bedding, mosquito nets, pillowcases, all of which are very complete. There are also hand grenades, engineering equipment, artillery observation instruments, and many other types, truly dazzling and inexhaustible.

Tanaka Wears a "Prisoner" Armband: Enemy Military Put on a Performance

The second part is heavy weapons and transportation equipment. All kinds of large and small artillery pieces and mobile generators used by the Japanese army are scattered on the square. On the walls around the auditorium, more than four hundred extremely valuable photographs are hung. The most attractive among them is a photo of Tanaka Hisaichi, the former commander of the Japanese 23rd Army and Governor of Hong Kong. In the photo, Tanaka Hisaichi's hat and military insignia have been removed, and he wears an armband with the word "Prisoner" on it. On this day, Commander Zhang Faqui also came to visit. When he saw Tanaka's photo, he immediately ordered his attendants to bring Tanaka's saber, which had been presented to him, to add to the interest. The third part is the New First Army's military animal performance ground. Inside, there are military dogs, military 鳃, military　, etc. These were originally trained by the Japanese army. They used to love being commanded in Japanese, but after being captured by our army and retrained, they can now listen to　　语 commands. When they perform various skills, gasps of surprise and admiration can be heard in the crowd.

If you don't feel that today is a holiday from any lively place, then you can look at the newspaper supplements. Rows of newspapers are displayed on the newsstands, vying for beauty. Red covers, extra-large red characters. Dagong Bao sacrifices especially, producing five large sheets, still selling for fifty yuan. "Zhongshan" and "Zhongzheng" are not willing to lag behind, both producing three and a half sheets, and the rest are two and a half to three sheets, and so on. Moreover, on Guangfu Middle Road, which is known as "Guangzhou Wangping Street," the Zhongshan Daily News Agency is decorated with colorful silk, dazzling and eye-catching, attracting many passersby to look up.

Lantern Parade: Gongs and Drums Fill the Air, Lion and Dragon Dance

Among all the events today, the most powerful, most exciting, and most attractive should be the lantern parade. The parade starts at six o'clock in the afternoon. Participating are party, government, and military agencies, schools, mass organizations, and various businesses, all sending personnel to make lanterns, costumes, dramas, dragon dances, and lion dances, with a total of 20,000 people. The long procession, brightly lit and filled with the sound of gongs and drums. The huge dragon and the majestic lions are doing their best to fly and dance, complementing each other. Among them, the 54th Army's participation is even more ingenious. They use jeeps to create huge moving fish, crabs, turtles, and彩龍船, stilts, costumes, etc. Other groups also have fish lanterns, oil chicken lanterns, etc. The streets they pass through are crowded with people, and the situation is so lively that it is truly unprecedented in Guangzhou in the past eight years.

The new scenery and the joyful, boiling atmosphere fill the entire New Year. This flourishing scene seems to be the enjoyment that a citizen of a victorious nation should have. However, from today onwards, the creation of history begins a new page. We should create miracles of a bright and glorious future, and spread this flourishing scene to every corner of the world.

### Three Thousand One Hundred Mile High Altitude Flight: Across the Atlantic

— By Our Special Correspondent, Zhu Jiarang

The ideal way to go from Europe to the United States is to take a "Queen" class ocean liner. It's truly a case of good value for money, stable, fast, and comfortable. But in the aftermath of the war, American soldiers are returning home in droves, and cabin space is extremely limited, often requiring a wait of two or three months. Moreover, according to my passport, it's good enough to travel by plane, so the British government put me on a flight list and told me to wait for good news. The departure date was close, as if it were just around the corner. But in fact, I waited a full three weeks before I could escape from the European continent.

Sea and Air Routes: Traffic Control Not Yet Lifted

Here, I would like to briefly describe the recent traffic conditions between Britain and the United States, which may be of assistance to future travelers. At present, the sea and air traffic between Britain and the United States is still largely under government control. However, Pan American Airlines and American Overseas Airlines have recently been able to carry passengers freely, without restrictions. As for maritime transport, it is still under the jurisdiction of the British Ministry of Transport. Without obtaining a priority permit, you cannot buy a ticket. But even if you obtain a priority permit, you can only rely on luck to get on a particular ship. It is easier to travel from the United States to Britain on a "Queen" ship than from Britain to the United States. It's already quite miserable to travel on an ordinary small ship. The interior furnishings are not very grand, which is a small matter, but the shaking is slow and unsettling, making it difficult to sit or stand still. Moreover, it takes ten or more days, which is truly a living hell. Especially in winter, the weather in the North Atlantic is bad, and the wind and waves are too strong. Recently, before Christmas, several ships in the ocean were caught in snowstorms, almost encountering accidents. Some turned back to repair their ships, and one drifted for eighteen days before finally arriving safely in the United States. They missed their Christmas holidays in disappointment. In terms of air transport, Britain and the United States each have their own systems. The British system is mainly for Overseas Airways. In winter, they usually take the southern route, which detours through Portugal. The route is long, the journey is long, and the price is also the most expensive, almost 800 US dollars. The northern route flies directly from Glasgow to Canada. The route is shorter and the fare is also cheaper. However, in terms of economy, it is still not as good as American civil aviation. When I was in London, a Pan American ticket to New York was only 93 pounds, which is about 372 US dollars. At one point, the price was automatically reduced to 65 pounds, but because Britain strongly opposed it, it returned to the original amount. However, because the price was low, the number of people registering was more crowded than the British planes. I had a special discussion with the company this time, and they promised to let me board earlier, but the British government's notice also arrived just in time. In order to maintain "international credibility," I finally gave up the cheap goods that I had already obtained.

Flying to Scotland: Crossing the Atlantic That Night

The sky was so gloomy, and rain was falling. We, a group of three, got into a large bus and drove for two hours to reach the airport. The place was so quiet. Besides the coal fire in the fireplace, which was still burning quite strongly, coupled with the emptiness in my heart, this trip of mine was the most unnatural. Seeing the rain getting heavier and heavier, I didn't know when I would be able to reach the distant future. The two others with me, one was the director of the Washington branch of British scientific research, and the other was a film merchant from Toronto, Canada. They were both honest and straightforward, and we could talk. Moreover, the film merchant's wife was the daughter of a clergyman, and she grew up in Zigong, Sichuan. Therefore, she was also interested in China. In this way, two hours were passed, and we all took off into the air.

This route first flies from London to Glasgow, Scotland. This is the second largest city in Britain, and Liverpool is also an important port. Many Chinese seamen are also concentrated here. In Glasgow, we stayed for another two and a half hours, ate a fairly sumptuous dinner, and then we were about to make the feat of crossing the Atlantic.

Body and Mind Shaking: Please Help Me in an Emergency

Under the fine rain, the cold wind outdoors was piercing to the bone. The weather was not very good, and the distance between the two continents, America and Europe, shown on the map was so long. For an inexperienced person like me, to be honest, I was a little worried about this flight. Plus, half an hour before departure, as usual, we had to listen to lectures and watch exercises on how to carry an oxygen bag and how to put on a life jacket, which made me even more uneasy, as if a disaster was about to strike. I even instinctively opened my mouth to the British doctor and said, "If there is an emergency, please help me!" Thinking about it afterwards, I felt it was really ridiculous.

At nine o'clock in the evening, the Liberty-style giant plane was ready to take off. We each钻进 the seats from 下. According to the weather that day, we had to 越 the cloud layer and fly at high altitude. Sure enough, in less than an hour,　　　告：the plane had reached 17,000 feet, and everyone had to wear oxygen masks to help them breathe. The temperature reached a minimum of minus thirty-three degrees Celsius. Although the heating pipes were all turned on, and three woolen blankets were added to our bodies, and we were wearing large cotton shoes, we were still軋軋 shivering. Touching the clothes on our bodies, they felt like they had been taken out of the refrigerator. Everyone's expressions were a bit serious, but we couldn't sleep, nor could we fall asleep. The flight attendants kept bringing coffee and cake, but everyone just shook their heads and thanked them.

However, that day's flight was indeed a very good success. Beforehand, the station reported that this pilot had flown across the Atlantic a hundred times. It seemed that he was quite experienced, so except for one or two short periods of　　　而外, we were all like walking on flat ground, even more stable than a train. The giant plane roared like thunder, with immense power. On the boundless, white-capped ocean, in the treacherous, remote, and渺的 high sky, it was always strong, brave, and moving forward. I thought we could rest our feet in Newfoundland, but轰隆轰隆, happy and tireless. As a result, we only landed upon reaching Montreal (Montrasal). Checking the map, it was a total of 3,141 miles. I had completed it all in one go. I hadn't even seen the Atlantic Ocean, and now I had already landed on the other shore.

An Unexpected Detour: Touring the Scenery of Canada

Canada is about five hours behind London time. We flew across the Atlantic in just thirteen flying hours, so we should have arrived at about ten o'clock the next morning. But looking out the window, it was still pitch black. It turned out that it was only five o'clock, and the journey had more hours to it. Getting off the plane, the earth was completely covered in snow, and the snow was still falling continuously. Taking the first taste of the North American cold wind, it was so sharp and fierce that it felt like my ears were about to be cut off. But as soon as I entered the room, it was spring everywhere, warm and lovely.

Coming to Canada was an unexpected detour for me. I didn't originally plan to do any sightseeing. In particular, the situation in America is different from that in Europe. There is nothing to say about history and local customs, but the streets are neat and the architecture has also learned from the American style. Skyscrapers are everywhere, and this scene is still full of novelty and progress. Montreal has more than one million people and is the largest city in Canada, belonging to Quebec, a wealthy and quiet place. That day, we entered the city at about eight o'clock. Under the heavy snow, suburban trams were carrying passengers to the office, and the crowds on the street were still quite crowded. Due to historical reasons, the French people here account for about 60 percent. Several large department stores and shops are mostly opened by French merchants, and the shops all have French-speaking clerks. Government documents are also mostly written in both English and French. Therefore, regardless of the degree, similar to Europe, an average person is speaking more than two languages to cope with today's world.

It is generally said that the cost of living in Canada is lower than in the United States, because at least in terms of currency, it is a ten percent discount. Other products are also more affordable. After my trial, it is indeed true, but it seems that it cannot be generalized. For example, leather shoes are still cheaper in the United States. Arrow shirts sell for two dollars and fifty cents in New York, but cost two dollars and seventy cents in Canada. A haircut costs one dollar and sixty cents. Eating breakfast can easily exceed one dollar. This standard is not too fair either. Canada's relationship with Britain is, of course, the closest, and the economy is naturally more integrated, so there are many British goods here. What could not be bought in the British mainland has actually been transported here.

### Tears Stain My Clothes as I Gaze at My Hometown

Because the reporter had other duties, he only stayed in Yangzhou for two days. He stole some time to go to "Fuchun Tea Shop" to taste the famous Yangzhou Dim Sum, Thousand-Layer Oil Cake, and Emerald Shaomai, which are indeed unique. The leisurely habit of the local people of "皮包水 in the morning and 水包皮 in the afternoon" has not changed due to the police and fear. Perhaps they all feel that righteousness can overcome evil flames, and light can drive away darkness? It is a pity that time was too short to 放棹 on Slender West Lake. Now, looking at Pingshuitang and Guanyin Mountain from afar, I am even more fascinated. The reporter has specially appended the "Song of the Refugees" of the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Association here:

"The north wind rises, the cold frost descends, the yellow leaves fall, the grass withers, enduring hunger and cold, drifting east and west, gazing at my hometown, tears stain my clothes!" Readers! I wonder what your feelings are? Note: The above section is only one part of the whole song. From this, one can imagine the depth of suffering in various districts of Yangzhou.

### The Impact of Scientific Progress on the Concept of War

— Zhao Zengjue

Atomic bombs are constantly improving, and atomic energy

Can be a blessing or a curse.

The year 1945 was not only a year of victory but also a year that ushered in a new era for the scientific community. On August 6 of the same year, US Secretary of War Stimson announced: "On July 16, 1945, the new atomic bomb was first tested in New Mexico, USA, and conducted in the rain. The bomb rapidly vaporized in a steel tower, and the thick smoke rushed into the stratosphere, causing a storm that shook windows two hundred and fifty air miles away. The firelight was clearly visible three miles away. Two people were knocked down by a kind of gravity 10,000 yards from the steel tower. Instantly, clouds of various colors shot straight into the sky, reaching 40,000 feet..." From this series of figures, one can see the unparalleled power unleashed by this new weapon, the energy of the atom, which represents a fundamental force in the universe. This fact not only illustrates the emergence of an unprecedented new weapon but also opens a new era in human science. Furthermore, the headquarters of the U.S. Army Strategic Air Forces announced on the 8th: "A Superfortress dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima on August 5, resulting in 60% of the city being destroyed." General Spaatz announced on August 10: "A second atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki at noon today by a Superfortress. This bomb is an improved version, easier to manufacture, and can produce greater explosive power. This bomb was dropped on the industrial center of Nagasaki. Within twelve hours of the atomic bomb being dropped, the entire city of Nagasaki was engulfed in flames. The smoke obscured the sky, even visible to pilots two hundred miles away. The bomber pilots reported that black smoke rose from the ground like a fountain, forming an umbrella-shaped fog cover reaching 20,000 feet. Physicists believe this black smoke is condensed from fragments of the underground Mitsubishi Steel and Arms factories in Japan. At the same time, scientists, based on this observation, declared that with the advent of this second atomic bomb, the first atomic bomb – the one dropped on Hiroshima – had become an antique." In these few short paragraphs, it can be seen that the atomic bomb is constantly evolving. Mankind's ability to control atomic energy is progressing. Today is more advanced than yesterday. Tomorrow will be even more advanced than today. This progress is faster than the progress of other sciences! Whether it brings disaster or blessing depends on how we use atomic energy. This is a new stage in human history.

Two: Offense is More Important Than Defense, Industry is More Important Than the Military

In the history of World War I, British military historian Major General J.F.C. Fuller wrote: "God grants victory to the greater industry, not to the greatest military." This statement was further confirmed in World War II. The victory of the Allied Nations must be attributed to material superiority and the accelerated mass production of the United States. It is necessary to have not only "superior quality" but also "large quantity." After the defeated Germany was inspected by experts sent by the Allied nations, they found that its weapons were not lacking in quality, but its output was insufficient. Therefore, the primary condition for national defense is not only to have superior scientific research capabilities but also to have superior mass production conditions. In other words, it is necessary to have industrial production that emphasizes both "quality and quantity." In the final act of this war, the atomic bomb indeed prevailed, but the German missiles (rockets) were also powerful new weapons. These two new weapons clearly indicate to us that "offense is more important than defense." If we can use atomic bombs to strike the enemy first, while massively destroying their cities, we may defeat the enemy in a matter of tens of hours or even minutes. The rockets we know now are only in their initial stages, with inaccurate aiming and insufficient range. However, science is likely to improve their accuracy and range, or perhaps enable rockets to surpass the navy. At the same time, atomic bombs are also constantly being improved, possibly to the point of precise detonation timing. Furthermore, it is very likely that atomic bombs will be mounted on rockets, aimed at the enemy's important cities, and launched in unison as a preemptive strike, annihilating the enemy and achieving victory in an extremely short period. U.S. military researcher Wanson Baldwin has imagined that future wars may become highly mechanized "Push Button Wars," where rockets and atomic bombs can be launched with the push of a button from thousands of miles away, killing the enemy and achieving results.

Three: The Status of Facsimile Transmission and Radar, The Status of Pilots and Troops

Some say that this was the last time fighter pilots were used in combat. U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff H.H. Arnold has also made this statement. This is because scientific progress has made it possible for radio to replace pilots in piloting aircraft, and for facsimile telegraphs, televisions, and radar to replace our eyes and ears. During World War II, aircraft used photography to scout enemy positions, and images taken on board could be transmitted back to the rear by facsimile transmission during flight breaks. The use of radar allowed for super-visual reconnaissance. Enemy aircraft hundreds of miles away, beyond our visual range, could be projected onto the screen of a reconnaissance device's cathode ray tube. If radar were placed on an aircraft, it could detect enemy ships hundreds of miles away on the ocean by emitting and reflecting ultra-short waves, and then bomb them. Truly, no ghosts or monsters could escape detection, like the "demon-revealing mirror" described in our "Investiture of the Gods"! In future wars, although the number of pilots may be reduced, with radio replacing pilots or long-range rockets replacing air raids, air personnel will still be needed to complete other special missions. Excellent pilots still have their place because we have not yet invented machines that can completely replace the human brain! In addition, the position of ground troops is also worth our attention. Because the aforementioned machines cannot replace the human brain, and any bombing has its shortcomings, ground troops still have their mission. Rockets, automatic aircraft, and atomic bombs can slaughter, destroy, and devastate anything on the ground, but they are passive rather than active. They can destroy but cannot occupy, threaten but cannot organize. Therefore, airborne troops and paratroopers will still be needed in the future. However, the training of future troops may need to focus on special skills for underground warfare. Our defense work must be in the underground, as Sun Tzu said, "Those skilled in war conceal themselves under the ninefold earth." However, whether it is possible to ensure safety underground remains a question.

Four: Conclusion

In summary, the rapid progress of science has not only changed future tactics but also changed strategy. High mountains, great rivers, and geographical obstacles have lost their significant military importance, and the army, navy, and air force have been relegated to the second tier of military power. At the same time, it has also changed our concept of building cities. Industrial construction must tend towards dispersal or concealment deep underground. Society and economic life will have similar reforms. All of this is due to the new factors created by the unparalleled power of the atomic bomb. However, perhaps the ferocity of the atomic bomb will enable the world to maintain peace and prevent the easy outbreak of inhumane wars. In other words, the ferocity of war may promote the improvement of human morality. The tragedy of scientific killing may improve the entire world's political diplomacy, gradually putting it on track to avoid the tragedy of human self-destruction. At the same time, the moral responsibility of scientists is to ensure that the great atomic energy not only does not harm humanity but also can be applied to industry to benefit humanity!

### Rumors Unconfirmed, Gold Notes All Recovered Well, Trading of New Hong Kong Dollars Slightly Reduced

Shanghai Red (烚赤) gradually stabilized yesterday, after initial weakness. In the securities market, accumulated funds after profit-taking, and strong players absorbed slightly. Although short sellers were still struggling, they were quite erratic in the middle of the day, but still trended upward in the afternoon. Opening in the morning continued the momentum from the previous day, retreating from 8.25 million to 8.18 million after unconfirmed rumors about U.S. dollars. As factories absorbed, the gold market triggered a wave of arbitrage buying, gradually pulling up. Some speculative funds from the securities sector came to embellish, and the overall situation stabilized, hovering around 8.35 million at noon. In the afternoon, major players covered their short positions, and the market tended to prosper in a peaceful state, finally rising above 8.5 million, recovering 225,000 compared to the previous close. Gold ornaments in silver shops were priced at 90,000, silver bullion at 700 yuan. Silver dollars, due to the ceasefire between the Nationalists and Communists, saw weakened sales from the Jiangbei (江北) region, retreating to around 445 yuan. Gambling spreads were about seven to ten cents. Lacking variation.

The rumors about U.S. dollars that circulated the previous day could not be confirmed, but people felt bored. Therefore, the market still hovered at a low price from the previous close at the opening. Later, with factories slightly absorbing, it gradually recovered well to above 1,400 yuan. The gold market gradually became active, and U.S. dollars also responded remotely due to arbitrage buying. It was even more stable in the afternoon, recovering 50 yuan compared to the previous close. Old Hong Kong dollars were stagnant, with no one paying attention. Although the final result was slightly better than the previous day by 5 yuan, it was at the selling price. New Hong Kong dollars were once raised to 90 yuan at the opening, but because the Guang (廣) region provided goods from 1937, and there were rumors that a ship would arrive in Shanghai tomorrow, the buying interest slightly faded, falling below 85. The final result was average.

### Public Bonds Dropped in Popularity and Rose in Cold Markets, Chinese Stocks Weaker Initially and Stronger Later, Speculative Funds Again Massively Shifted to Foreign Stocks

Public bonds were still stable initially, but the funds in the hands of those in the industry were limited, and they lacked the strength to pull up. Therefore, Grade C bonds saw a high price of 1,350 yuan before falling downstream. Many long holders also took advantage of the situation to sell. Other miscellaneous brands (另　雜牌) were used to make a net profit on the difference. The market showed a phenomenon of popular bonds dropping and unpopular bonds rising. Grade C finally hovered around the 1,300 yuan mark, while Grade D bonds rose to above the 1,000 yuan mark, exceeding the Grade E bonds, which were usually considered popular, by more than ten yuan. The afternoon close showed that Grades A and B rose by 100 yuan, Grade D by 120 yuan, Grade E by 75 yuan, and Grade C had no progress.

The Chinese stock market situation was still extremely chaotic. Many retail investors took the opportunity to sell short. Occasionally, a few short positions were excessive, and they were forced to cover their short positions at the close. Therefore, although it was weak in the middle of the day, with Yong Yarn (永紗) falling to 1,180 yuan, Mei Ya (美亞) to 865 yuan, Xin Guang (新光) within 70 yuan, Jing Fu (景福) to 58 yuan, and Qin Xing (勤興) to 56 yuan, the foreign stock market was surprisingly strong at this time. Influenced by this, many sold off foreign stocks and re-entered, stabilizing after the weakness. As short sellers eagerly covered their positions at noon, buying interest rekindled and became fierce again. The afternoon close was all at high prices. Compared to the previous close, Yong Yarn rose by 180 yuan, Mei Ya by 75 yuan, and the "Three Small Hot" stocks each rose by 7 yuan to 8.5 yuan. Bidding continued to rise in the afternoon.

Foreign stocks were sought after by the remaining funds of the silver and money industry and the profits of the yarn and securities sectors. Half of it was hyped up. Retail investors followed suit. Foreign stocks had been frozen for a long time, and there were few chips. All stocks rose. Jardine Matheson (會德豐) once stood above the 10,000 yuan mark for a long time. Steel industry stocks were the most popular due to their small price and the sound of resumption of work, and they rose by another 10% to 20%. Small stocks and unpopular stocks had more buyers.

### Rice Prices Rose and Then Fell, Edible Oil and Soybeans Remained Active

The rice situation in the northern market turned sluggish and returned to a weak state. Southern glutinous rice and early indica rice fell by 500 to 600 yuan. Northern glutinous rice also fell by over 200 yuan. Early season indica and Du indica both fell by 200 to 300 yuan. White rice fell by 200 to 300 yuan. Only Yang indica and Hidden Origin (陰元) goods were scarce and still strong. Flour was sluggish, with prices falling by 200 to 300 yuan. In the edible oil market, the Ningbo (甬) traders continued to ship out, and retail sales on the street were also active, rising by another 2,000 yuan. Soybeans were also active, continuing to rise by 100 to 200 yuan. Soybean cake continued to fall by 100 yuan. Wine prices were similar, and raw peanuts remained firm.

### Rayon Continues to Rise, The Future of Silk Factories is Dim

The rally in rayon was very strong last Sunday. Yesterday, the price of 20-count rayon opened at 910,000 yuan at the Tianqiao (天橋) market and closed at 960,000 yuan. The price continued to trade at 965,000 yuan in the afternoon, which was 60,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Actual demand was very strong, and there was no supply available, resulting in a steady rise. The price of 150-count rayon has exceeded the million-yuan mark. The hope for warehouse receipts is slim, and the distance between the price and the spot price is increasing daily. The industry was trading among themselves at 735,000 to 740,000 yuan. The factories' situation was mixed, with very little trading. The silk market was slightly higher. Mei Ya fabric was 595,000 yuan, Dacheng (大誠) checkered crepe was 1,770 yuan, and Minsheng (民生) brocade was 9,500 yuan. According to those in the industry, the cost of silk was far exceeding the selling price. Raw material prices were rising without end. Small silk factories may not be able to sustain, and production is bound to decrease in the future.

### Green Tea Supply Cannot Meet Demand

The inventory of tea leaves in this city is currently weak, especially for high-quality fried green and baked green tea, which are almost sold out. Recently, the Tianjin (天津) traders have been very active, so everyone is lamenting that supply cannot meet demand. The market is becoming more aggressive, and prices rose again yesterday, with a general increase day by day. Other varieties are also following the firm market under the continued absorption by actual buyers. Although prices have not soared, they are generally stable with the market.

### Yarn Market as Solid as Ever

Yesterday, inland traders purchased cotton yarn. Cotton mills also absorbed well, so the price of 20-count ordinary brand and 16-count yarn rose by 20,000 yuan. The price of Special Double Horse brand was very ordinary, still trading between 740,000 and 750,000 yuan. The price of fine yarn and double-strand yarn was lower by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan compared to the previous day because the Textile Construction Company supplied them steadily. People were hesitant, and there was a sense of being wary of the high price. This is because, in terms of the price index, the yarn multiple is higher than other commodities.

### Coal Lumps Stable, Small Coal Sales are Strong

White coal lumps remain stable, while white small coal sales are strong because the market price of white small coal is cheaper compared to coal lumps. Bituminous coal lumps continued their previous momentum and were still strong. Bituminous coal dust once shouted a high price, but because factory sales were sluggish, and there was a lack of opinion from the main buyers, it eventually returned to a stable price.

### Thick White Iron Sheet Sales are Strong, Cement Spot Goods are Very Popular

The sales of flat white iron sheets have expanded again, especially for 24-gauge and 26-gauge thick sheets. Customer traders purchased and absorbed them very well, and more than a thousand loads were transported. Currently, traders who are dismantling goods charge about 80,000 yuan per group.

In recent days, cement factories have had very little output due to the lack of large quantities of fuel supply. Orders for more than a hundred bags have been delayed. Therefore, the spot market is more popular than before, with each bag costing 4,500 yuan.

### Guangdong Merchants Request Modification of Overseas Chinese Remittance Rate

[United Press, Guangzhou, November 11] Merchants here are requesting to revise the remittance rate for overseas Chinese remittances to China. Before the war, the number of remittances reached millions of US dollars annually. The current remittance rate is US$1 for 500 legal currency, causing many overseas Chinese to prefer remitting to Hong Kong, converting to legal currency, in order to avoid calculating at the official price. After transferring through Hong Kong, they can get 800 more legal currency, and if they convert through the black market, they can get 1,300 more legal currency. Guangzhou merchants believe that if the government maintains the old exchange rate, it will lose a great opportunity to obtain US dollar reserves.

### Korean僑 Fight Vigorously; Yesterday Drew with Italian僑 Team; Score was One to One

Yesterday afternoon's football league, there was a Group A match at Jiaozhou Park at 2:30 PM. The Italian僑 team was making its first appearance, which attracted a lot of attention from the audience, making the stadium quite lively. The result of the match was a one-to-one draw, which was quite unexpected. The first half ended one-to-one, and no goals were scored in the second half. The Korean僑 team's bravery and effort were also significant. The Italian僑 team was clearly out of practice, and there was an obvious disconnect, otherwise, they should have been able to defeat the Korean僑 team.

After the start of the match, the Korean僑 team fought bravely, and the Italian僑 team seemed to have difficulty defending in a hurry. In the 13th minute, the Korean僑 team had a corner kick opportunity, which was taken by Hong Shengyu on the right wing. The landing point was very good, and Song Xingxie jumped up and headed the ball. McNitti jumped up a step late, and the ball went into the net. After the Italian僑 team conceded a goal, they had to put in more effort. Two minutes later, Villa shot from the right corner, hit the goalpost, and bounced back. Tekni took advantage of the situation and kicked the ball straight into the net. The first half ended one-to-one, with no winner decided. In the second half, the Italian僑 team launched a fierce offensive, but unfortunately, their luck was not good. The Korean僑 team also did not let up. Until the end of the match, neither side scored, and the game ended in a one-to-one draw.

### Tangshan Institute of Technology in the Past Eight Years

—Xiao Jin

Tangshan Institute of Technology is a department of Jiaotong University, located in Tangshan on the Beining Railway before the war, where the coal mines are located. Perhaps because it only offers two departments, civil engineering and mining and metallurgy, the general public is very unfamiliar with it, but it is very famous in our country's railway, highway, and other national defense engineering departments. It was founded in the 31st year of the Guangxu reign of the former Qing Dynasty and has been around for 41 years. In these long years, in an environment that neglected engineering education, Tangshan Institute of Technology has always painstakingly cultivated thousands of talents, giving new arteries to ancient China!

This is only a report on the experiences of Tangshan Institute of Technology in the past eight years since the war. As for the situation before the war, it has been omitted due to space constraints.

Beginning the Relocation from Shanghai to Hunan

When the bugle call of the War of Resistance against Japan sounded from Donggou Bridge, Tangshan Institute of Technology was the first to encounter disaster. In a hurry, nothing was rescued. They went to Shanghai and stayed with the main campus for a few months. However, the great cause of the War of Resistance against Japan was a long-term one. Under the call of the leader, Tangshan Institute of Technology relocated inland regardless of everything. A week after the fall of Nanjing, with the assistance of alumni, classes were resumed in Xiangtan, Hunan [a small town ninety li south of Changsha]. At that time, the Ministry of Education did not provide funding, and the professors were all voluntary. The students also endured all the difficulties and worked with the school in harmony to overcome the difficult times. Under the leadership of President Mao Yisheng, with only 600 yuan donated by alumni each month, Tangshan Institute of Technology was reborn and finally took on the new mission entrusted by the War of Resistance, cultivating a large number of engineering talents to serve the motherland and open up the source of activities for the War of Resistance.

The Great Fire of Changsha Forced the Move to Yangjiatan

The Great Fire of Changsha forced Tangshan Institute of Technology to move to Yangjiatan. That was a small village, and this was only a temporary solution. At the same time, the enemy's claws were pressing on us, so in the winter of the 27th year, the plan to move west to Kunming was decided. All the teachers and students of the institute formed more than a dozen units and embarked on the westward journey in batches. In Guilin, they encountered the enemy's bombing again, and the students' luggage and the school's instruments and books were all lost. However, the plan to move west was still not abandoned, and the teachers and students moved forward to Kunming step by step. At that time, the "Development of the Great Southwest" plan was being implemented, and Guizhou became the center of the Great Southwest. Tangshan Institute of Technology encountered this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and honorably took on the task of guiding higher education in Guizhou, stopping in Pingyue County, more than a hundred kilometers east of Guiyang.

Developing the Southwest and Entering Pingyue

Pingyue was a desolate mountain town with only a hundred households, and food depended entirely on external aid. In this environment, the teachers and students of Tangshan Institute of Technology silently and diligently developed this primitive mountain town. After more than six years of cultivation, the face of the mountain town changed. Junior high schools and high schools were established one after another, and the cultural level of the people improved a lot. A small highway stretched tortuously through the mountains to Machangping [a large station one hundred kilometers east of Guiyang] and connected to the Southwest Highway.

In Pingyue, Tangshan Institute of Technology still maintained the two-department system. At this time, the Railway Management College of Jiaotong University in Peiping (which had moved from Yangjiatan with Tangshan Institute of Technology) was also in Pingyue. The two institutes of Tangshan and Peiping became one, and the Ministry of Education also merged the two institutes and renamed them "Guizhou Branch of Jiaotong University." The first president was Mr. Hu Boyuan.

Instruments and books are the second life of a school, especially for engineering. Tangshan Institute of Technology moved inland empty-handed and was bombed by enemy planes on the way. It can be said that there was not a single instrument or a single book. Under the circumstances of the War of Resistance, it was not easy to purchase from the outside, so a donation campaign was launched. With the care of alumni, good results were obtained. At the same time, the school also tried to purchase some, so although it was not as complete as before the war, it was enough for learning purposes.

In mid-November of the 33rd year, the defense of "Hunan and Guangxi" ended like lightning. When the enemy's iron hooves reached Dushan, Tangshan Institute of Technology stopped classes in a hurry. All the teachers and students had no choice but to abandon their luggage and flee in panic. In a situation where the war was losing ground and the front and rear were in chaos, the teachers and students of Tangshan Institute of Technology threw away their luggage again and again and embarked on the 500-kilometer Sichuan-Guizhou Road. Under the threat of wind and snow and the warm care of alumni, they arrived in Chongqing, and more than 500 displaced hearts temporarily settled down. "Everything for the War of Resistance," "Everything for the Motherland," what do these sufferings and these tribulations count for!

Finding School Buildings in Dingjia'ao

When Professor Luo, who had been teaching for more than 30 years, escaped from Pingyue and arrived in Chongqing, the alumni association held a welcome party and discussed the issue of resuming classes. After more than a month of running around, with the help of alumni in various ways, school buildings were found in Dingjia'ao Town, on the Chengdu-Chongqing Highway, one hundred kilometers west of Chongqing. It was the old site of the Transportation Technology Personnel Training Institute of the Ministry of Transportation. Although it was not as spacious as the school buildings in Pingyue, it was barely usable. However, everything that had been done in Pingyue for eight years was in vain. Although some instruments and books were shipped out later, it could not heal this huge wound.

Today's Tangshan Institute of Technology is still at the pre-war level. All the professors are old, and there are many who have been teaching for 30 or 20 years. The teaching standards are still the same as before the war. However, the number of students has doubled, and there are now more than 400 people. The Peiping Railway Management College, which shared hardships with it, also maintained the pre-war standards. Under the name of "Guizhou Branch of Jiaotong University," it is cultivating talents for national construction in the spirit of forty years of tradition.

Finally, to end this article, I will quote Dr. Mao Yisheng's words at the celebration of the resumption of school in Xiangtan on December 15 last year:

"The fate of our Tangshan Institute of Technology in the past eight years has been cyclical. Eight years ago, we fell from the mountain (Tangshan) into the pond (Xiangtan), and then climbed from the pond to the beach (Yangjiatan), and from the beach to the plain (Pingyue). Now we have entered the waterless gully (Dingjia'ao), but in May next year, we can return to our old home."

Indeed, Tangshan Institute of Technology, like the motherland, has also been revived. According to President Gu Yisun, the future development of Tangshan Institute of Technology is to become a perfect independent college, and to add a mechanical and electrical engineering department to meet the needs of the new Chinese construction.

### Bao Jing'an Arrives in Shanghai to Welcome Patterson

U.S. Secretary of War Patterson, who left the eastern United States at the end of last month, is currently in Tokyo. It is now heard that Mr. Patterson will arrive in Shanghai within days, and Bao Jing'an, the director of the Foreign Affairs Department of the Nanjing Army Headquarters, has been ordered to go to Shanghai on the 12th to welcome him.

[Our Newspaper] According to U.S. military sources: U.S. Secretary of War Patterson has rescheduled his arrival in Shanghai for next Tuesday.

### Wei Daoming Returns Home to Report on His Duties

[Our Newspaper] According to authoritative American sources in this city, Wei Daoming, our ambassador to the United States, who will arrive in Shanghai next Monday, may be assigned to another position after returning home to report on his duties.

### The Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is Selling Flour

The Relief and Rehabilitation Administration suddenly took emergency steps yesterday to stabilize the market price of flour in this city. In the morning, the Administration's finance department sent personnel to the Municipal Grain Association to publicly sell 10,000 bags of American wheat flour on the market. The bid was 3,700 yuan per bag, and a public notice was posted, which read: "This Administration currently has 10,000 bags of No. 2 American wheat flour for sale at a price of 3,700 yuan per bag. Those who wish to purchase are requested to go to the offices of the Renji Road Fufeng and Fuxin factories before 2:00 PM today to complete the procedures. This notice is hereby given." It is understood that the Administration began processing the fourth phase of flour sales from the 11th. After four days of applying for registration, and widely distributing to large flatbread and American bread stalls, as of yesterday, more than 15,000 application forms had been issued. While processing the application procedures, an investigation was also initiated. Anyone with a business license and a guarantor was immediately issued a purchase certificate by the investigator on the spot, and the applicant could use the certificate to pay for the goods when they were sold on the 17th. Therefore, the sales of flour in the market of this city gradually became sluggish, and the market price should have temporarily stabilized and would not rise immediately. However, at this time, the demand from out-of-town clients in Qingdao, Taiwan, Fuzhou, and Hankou became stronger, and the market price not only did not fall but rose by 500 to 600 yuan compared to last week. The price of No. 1 flour even exceeded 4,000 yuan. Therefore, in order to stabilize the price of flour, the Administration resolutely sold it publicly yesterday. It is also understood that purchasers must complete the purchase procedures before 2:00 PM yesterday, otherwise, the public notice will not be bound by the bid price. This type of sale is not periodic.

### Agricultural Vice Minister Yan Shenyu Goes to Wuxi to Inspect

In order to urge the recovery of enemy and puppet organizations in the Beijing-Shanghai area, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry sent Administrative Vice Minister Yan Shenyu to Shanghai to supervise. Mr. Yan flew to Shanghai from Chongqing on the 4th and has been inspecting farms, pastures, aquatic products, and silk-related organizations for several days, and has been very busy. He also convened a symposium with fishery and aquatic product leaders on the 9th and held a talk with the directors and supervisors of the China Silk Company on the 10th. All issues have been resolved in an orderly manner. It is heard that the Ministry's farms in Shanghai that have been taken over have been reorganized into the Shanghai Experimental Economic Farm of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and Zhang Binchen has been appointed as the farm manager, and Zhang Jizhi as the deputy farm manager. The Shanghai Fish Market will be officially restored soon, and a general manager and deputy manager will be elected. The China Aquatic Products Company will also formally conduct business based on the regulations passed by the Executive Yuan and produce supervisors. The Central Plant Protection Machinery Factory is also preparing to move to Shanghai. As for the China Silk Company, which is jointly operated by the Ministry and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the takeover has been completed, and Chairman Zhou has first hired Ge Jingzhong as the acting general manager to begin operations, purchasing silkworm eggs and replenishing mulberry seedlings. After completing his official duties, Mr. Yan went to Wuxi with Special Envoy Peter Zuoqiong yesterday morning to inspect the Ministry's agricultural tool manufacturing plant in Wuxi. He will go to Beijing soon and return to Chongqing via that route.

### Accusations of Treason and Collaboration: Xue Jingdao and Others on Trial

(Our Newspaper) This morning, the Special Criminal Court of the High Court continued to hear two cases of treason. First, Judge Zhu Zonghai ascended to the court. The defendant, Xue Jingdao, a native of Changzhou, 32 years old, once served as a company commander under Shi Yaoming, a puppet army officer in Yixing. Later, he joined the New Fourth Army and reported Zhang Tao, a member of our guerrilla team, and Ding Zixi, a member of the Kuomintang, and Zhang was arrested and died as a result. Therefore, Xue Jingdao's uncle, Jing Zhen, accused him of endangering the Republic of China. Xue was arrested in Shanghai, but Xue denied reporting Zhang and Ding in court, claiming that his uncle had falsely accused him out of personal revenge. Because the accuser Xue Zhen did not arrive, the court's discussion of the case is still under investigation, and the hearing will be rescheduled.

Next, Presiding Judge Liu Yugui interrogated Zhang Bingheng, the owner of Fengtai Copper and Tin Shop on Beijing Road, and his partner Zhang Yizhi. Zhang Bingheng, a native of Nanjing, 32 years old, seized the opportunity during the period of darkness to collect copper coins and hardware materials for the enemy, and then took a concubine and bought real estate with 20 gold bars last year, living a comfortable life. After the victory, the police station reported the case, and Zhang was arrested and transferred to the court. Yesterday, the judicial officer of the Huangpu Branch Bureau also came to the court to report on the handling process, but Zhang argued that he had no dealings with Japanese businessmen. The court immediately wanted to examine the store's account books, but Zhang claimed that the account books were kept by the accountant, who had gone to Nanjing and whose address was unknown. At this point, the presiding judge ordered a recess for further inquiry, and the defendant was remanded in custody.

Also, there will be no hearing today. A large number of treason cases will be heard tomorrow. It is planned to hear Ling Guangyan and Xue Youwen and others at 9:00 AM, sentence Xu Xing and hear Gu You's case at 2:00 PM, and hear Jiang Yougen, Zuo Ming and others at 3:00 PM.

### A Portion of the Air Force Arrives in Shanghai, Waiting for Ships to Go to the United States for Training

[News] Jiang Yifu, commander of the Third Air Force District, arrived here from Hangzhou a few days ago. Yesterday afternoon, a reporter from this newspaper visited him. According to him, there are currently 480 personnel from the Air Force combat unit here, who will soon be sent to various locations on the West Coast of the United States for training, studying bombing and other tactics. The Air Force personnel going abroad this time have all participated in air battles in various places and are currently undergoing physical examinations, injections, and other preparations. Once the U.S. military has completed the ship arrangements, they can depart. In addition, other technical personnel studying mechanics, radio, etc., will also arrive here one after another and transfer to the United States for training. According to Mr. Jiang, the Hangzhou Air Force Military Academy will be established soon.

The headquarters of the Third District Command has been set up in Shanghai. The main task of the department is air transportation and the transportation of materials. In addition, it is also responsible for taking over enemy equipment and transporting surplus materials from U.S. military outposts. It is heard that the takeover of enemy equipment in Hangzhou has been completed and the takeover affairs in the six districts of the city are being handled.

### Koreans Forcibly Conscript Chinese Laborers, Detained by Military Police for Investigation

[Our Newspaper] Li Guiyun, a Korean, in his thirties, once acted as a lackey for the Japanese under the iron heels of the Japanese, and forcibly conscripted Chinese people in Shanghai to work as coolies in Dinghai. More than two or three hundred people were deceived by him. Chen Jiafeng, an electrician, was also one of those forcibly conscripted. After arriving in Dinghai, he suffered all kinds of torture. After the victory, he came to Shanghai. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, Chen was visiting a ball game in Jiaozhou Park when he suddenly saw Li in the stadium. He stepped forward and dragged him to the West Shanghai Military Police Branch, where he was detained to investigate his criminal evidence.

### Requests for Return of Real Estate for Those Who Were Not Owners During the Occupation Period

During the period of the puppet organization in Shanghai during the occupation, there was an organization called the "Shanghai City Non-Resident Land and House Management Committee". All land and houses owned by citizens that were not registered with the committee were considered non-resident owners and were managed and leased by the puppet committee. At that time, the general public who followed the government inland and some people with pure thoughts were unwilling to register, or because their property certificates were deposited elsewhere and could not be registered, they were arbitrarily disposed of by the committee. Among them, there were also not a few people who relied on the power of the enemy and puppets to collude and occupy the properties. It is learned that the Municipal Land Administration Bureau is taking over these cases. In order to protect the legitimate rights and interests of the owners, it has begun to clean them up. The main points of the approach are: (1) For land and houses that were managed and leased by the puppet committee, the original owners who have not yet recovered their property rights should submit accurate property documents to the Land Administration Bureau to apply for their return. (2) All contracts for land and houses leased from the puppet committee are invalid.

[Our Newspaper] General Wedemeyer declared at a reception for reporters yesterday morning: "The 'Truce Agreement' established in Chongqing is the greatest achievement of Marshal Marshall's work in China after his arrival." Marshal Ma has handled various issues with impartiality and has gained the trust of people from all parties in Chongqing. Mr. Wei also stated: "The New Sixth Army will begin transporting from Shanghai to the Northeast on the 16th of this month.

### Implementing Medical and Pharmaceutical Relief: Scheduled Flat-Rate Prescription

In order to implement medical and pharmaceutical relief, the Municipal Health Bureau, in addition to establishing two pharmaceutical supply offices in this city to supply medicines at flat prices, yesterday also invited major pharmacies to discuss the issue of flat-rate prescriptions and night service. Director Yu Songyun of the Health Bureau reported that he hoped that the new pharmaceutical industry would cooperate and support the widespread establishment of flat-rate prescriptions. At the same time, the work of night service will be distributed to benefit citizens. After discussion, the principle was unanimously agreed upon, and it was decided to start processing flat-rate prescriptions from the 21st.

### Theft of Coal from the Beipiao Coal Stack: Complex Contents

[Our Newspaper] The Beipiao Coal Stack, which was taken over by the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee, was stolen twice in the middle of last month and at the beginning of this month, with a total of more than 200 tons of coal stolen. After investigation by the audit team of the association and the police bureau, the case has been solved, and the thieves have been sent to the port waterway police station and the police station for interrogation. It is learned that the contents of the case are complex and have been reported to the relevant authorities for instruction.

### Busy Transportation - Lack of Vehicles on Both Lines

The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines have been extremely crowded with passengers since their takeover. Although there have been some improvements recently, many travelers are still unable to secure passage. Our reporter made a special investigation and found that the existing number of vehicles is less than before the war, while the number of passengers has increased. Before the war, the monthly passenger count was approximately 1.3 million, but now it is approximately 1.9 million, an increase of over 38% compared to before the war. The number of vehicles before the war was 358, but now there are only 200, a decrease of 40%. This means that the existing vehicles need to accommodate about twice as many passengers as before the war, so you can imagine how crowded it is. Recently, due to busy emergency transportation, the vehicles are even more insufficient. For example, the 23rd and 24th train's third-class passenger cars on the Beijing-Shanghai line, and the 61st and 62nd train's third and fourth-class cars on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, had to be temporarily suspended due to emergency transportation. All parties hope that the government will quickly add vehicles, such as requesting allocation from the Relief Administration, to facilitate passenger transport.

Increasing Ticket Offices

Previously, due to the limited number of ticket offices on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, passengers had to crowd to buy tickets. Now, the railway bureau has added a new ticket office inside the North Station. The ticket office has three ticket windows for first-class on the Beijing-Shanghai line, five for second and third class each, and one for first-class on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, and two each for second and third class. Currently, the North Station and China Travel Service have more than 25 ticket windows. All ticket windows sell tickets three hours before departure, so passengers do not need to rush to buy tickets. The station has also recently made the number of second-class ticket windows equal to the number of third-class ticket windows, because the number of second-class passengers has been increasing recently, and their number is not less than that of third-class passengers.

Beijing-Shanghai Train Derailment

At 10:00 AM on the 11th, a Beijing-Shanghai railway freight train derailed near Xinfeng Station between Zhenjiang and Danyang because the screws on the rails were removed. The locomotive was not damaged, and the loss was minor. After emergency repairs by the railway authorities, traffic was restored at 9:30 PM that afternoon. The cause of the removal is currently being investigated.

### Careless Fire at Nanxu Apartment

[Our Newspaper] Room 301 of the Nanxu Public Apartment at No. 1843 Linsen Middle Road caught fire at approximately 7:16 AM yesterday, accidentally affecting the front building of Room 401.

### General Wedemeyer Issues a Message to American Troops

The following is the message issued by General Wedemeyer, Commander of the US Forces in the China Theater, to his troops: "I am well aware that you have learned from the press and radio that American troops have held demonstrations in the Philippines, Japan, Honolulu, Paris, and the United States, all with the common goal of demanding to be discharged and returned home. They believe that the war is over and that their mission is complete. I am well aware that you also hope to return to your homeland as soon as possible.

I am also aware that you may hold similar demonstrations and gatherings. You have never initiated such behavior, which is comforting to me. You have followed my orders and have never violated them, even though it has been difficult. The US government's recently announced China policy shows that we have unfinished work. I have tried to clarify this point in the press and radio.

My staff will continue to study the current situation in the China Theater. Once our government's goals are achieved, I will request that Washington send you home. We are not here to perform tasks for China, but to work for our own country's policies. President Truman also made this clear in his speech, stating that our efforts today are to maintain peace and avoid another war. You believe that we will carry out this task. I have served in the military for twenty years, and I have always shared weal and woe with the soldiers. Your ability to obey orders will be a source of pride for other naval and army units and our people."

### Motorized Junks Operating on North-South Shipping Routes - The Chuyuan Steamer Escapes Danger and Arrives in Shanghai

[Our Newspaper] Due to official duties, cargo transportation on the Yangtze River line is obstructed, and passengers can still be transported, but ships are severely lacking. The North-South shipping routes are even more lacking in ships. Recently, motorized junks have been operating, all represented by temporary shipping companies, with small transportation capacity, the largest being only 200 tons. These ships were originally used as auxiliary transportation after the destruction of Japanese naval transport ships. Now they have been taken over by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, with a total of more than 20 ships, which have been leased out separately, operating in coastal ports in Fuzhou, Quanzhou, and Fujian Province, as well as Taiwan and Qingdao, with very good business. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company on the Yangtze River line has scheduled the Jianghua, Jiangya, and Guotai steamers to sail to Hankou next week, and the Jiangyu steamer to sail to Yichang. The Fengmao steamer, managed by Yonghe Company, is scheduled to go directly to Hankou on the 15th. The Dada steamer of Dada Company is scheduled to return to Shanghai from Hankou today and will sail to Hankou next Wednesday or Thursday for official duties. The Chuyuan steamer of the company, which was previously stranded near Yichang, has escaped danger and been launched, and will also arrive in Shanghai today for repairs in the dock. The Yongkang steamer of Sanbei Company has completed repairs and is scheduled to sail to Hankou on the 15th. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has dispatched the Haifu motorized steamer to Qingdao, scheduled to sail on the 16th. It is difficult to predict whether it can be exported on schedule. Three British ships are already operating on the Shanghai-Hong Kong line. The Yuezhou steamer left port yesterday afternoon to sail to Hong Kong. The Yongsheng steamer had more than 300 passengers and left port late at 3 PM. The Guiyang steamer arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong yesterday and is scheduled to sail to Hong Kong next Tuesday. It is said that more than 400 seats have been booked, and ticket sales will officially begin tomorrow.

Cause of the Minyu Incident

After the Minyu steamer of Minsheng Company was salvaged from the water on the evening of the other day, the cause of the sinking was found to be three holes about five inches below the black bar in front of the stern kitchen. The sizes of the three holes were: one with a diameter of two inches, and the other two smaller, with a diameter of half an inch. When the ship is empty, it is only about six inches above the water, but when the cargo is loaded, it is very close to the water surface, which can easily cause danger. As for the responsibility, it is being negotiated by the company.

### Establishing an Examination Center to Inspect Prostitutes' Health

[Our Newspaper] The Municipal Police Bureau has been implementing the registration of brothels since the 3rd of this month, in order to review and issue licenses after they are qualified. It is reported that 650 units have been registered so far, and then the registration of prostitutes will begin. The Municipal Police Bureau will also jointly run an inspection center with the Health Bureau to strictly inspect the health of prostitutes in order to prevent the spread of diseases.

The city's dance halls and dancers are also undergoing registration applications. It is reported that the police bureau attaches great importance to this and will conduct strict reviews. All employees of the dance hall must be thoroughly investigated, and the personal licenses of dancers must also be restricted.

### Visiting Li Shizeng

— Liming

On a cloudy morning, the reporter braved the cold and headed towards a destination in western Shanghai. In a small bungalow with a rural flavor, surrounded by sparse trees, I met Mr. Li Shizeng, a veteran of the party-state who had just flown in from the wartime capital. Mr. Li is sixty-six years old this year. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, he traveled internationally to promote culture. After presenting my card and briefly stating my intentions, we began our conversation.

The Last Plane Leaving the Port to Go Abroad

Mr. Li left the country during the July 7th Lugouqiao Incident and the fierce battle of Shanghai on August 13th. He traveled around the two continents of Europe and America, first attending the International Cultural Cooperation Conference in Paris, France, and then flew back to Wuhan, the center of China's war effort at the time. When the Pacific War broke out, Mr. Li lived in Hong Kong. The fierce flames of Japanese invasion spread to the south, and he had to leave the isolated island. I remember taking the last plane to Honolulu. After staying in New York for several months, he and Dr. Hu Shi, the ambassador to the United States, promoted China's important task of resisting the war, fighting for world peace, and fighting for international justice, which won the sympathy of the people there. They actively assisted China with manpower and material resources. Due to the Pacific War affecting the overall situation in the world, he felt the need to go to Europe to promote it. He did not hesitate to travel from New York to London, England, to promote and launch the滇缅 (Yunnan-Burma) joint offensive.

Visiting Paris Again

Since the United Nations opened the second front and landed in Normandy, France, the Hitler regime has been severely hit, and the European situation has taken a sharp turn for the worse. General de Gaulle, who had been fighting hard on the battlefield for a long time and worked hard to rebuild the country, finally triumphantly returned to the capital of France - Paris. At this time, Mr. Li was flying from London to France, which was recovering after the war, to visit. This was the old man's old place of travel, and old friends and new acquaintances gathered happily, which was of course unspeakably pleasant. It is said that since Pétain was exiled and Laval was executed, the country has unanimously launched a movement to eliminate traitors. However, France's finances are difficult after the war and it needs a lot of US assistance. The French people have a very good impression of de Gaulle and consider him a meritorious hero.

Publishing the Great Work "World Dictionary of Learning"

Now that the world's two major stubborn enemies have been wiped out and the anti-aggression work has come to an end, Mr. Li has also returned to China from his tired travels in Europe and the United States. He arrived in Shanghai last week and continues to work hard on the construction of cultural undertakings. The first and most important task is to publish a masterpiece, the "World Dictionary of Learning". The project is quite large and cannot be completed overnight. The old man has strong perseverance and has planned and prepared everything.

The Immortal Undertaking of Zhihui University

The second task is to promote the immortal undertaking of Zhihui University. Respecting the old (Cai Yuanpei) is eighty years old this year. His words and his personality are worthy of our admiration. The cells of Zhihui University are not only distributed throughout the country, but also in major cities around the world such as London, New York, Paris, Geneva, and Brussels. My country, such as the National Peking Research Institute and the famous World College in this city, were all founded by Respecting the old, the purpose is to take the world as a university and the universe as the object of research, and all schools will converge and return to one.

### US Surplus Materials Should Be Sold to China - US Senator Donnell Advocates

[Our Newspaper] Members of the US Senate Committee on Military Affairs, Republican Nolan and Democrat Donnell, were sent to fly around the world to inspect US surplus materials and the repatriation of US troops. They arrived in Shanghai on the other day. At 8:30 AM yesterday, the two had a hearing at the former American Club to hear the appeals of more than 700 US troops in this city regarding their early repatriation.

Sino-US Trade Linked by This

In order to understand their views on the disposal of US surplus materials, the reporter paid a special visit to the two at their residence at the Cathay Hotel yesterday. According to Mr. Donnell, his personal opinion is that the surplus materials of the US military in the Philippines should be sold to China so that various materials and equipment can serve the welfare of mankind in a short period of time. Mr. Donnell believes that the sale of these surplus materials is actually the prelude to restoring the close ties of Sino-US trade, and looking forward to the future, our country will be the best customer of the United States. He also said that our country will have a "peculiar future".

Inspecting the Treatment of US Troops

Regarding the issue of the repatriation of US troops, it is said to be a matter for the US Army and Navy Departments and Congress. His task is to inspect whether US troops in various places are receiving appropriate treatment, listen to the appeals of US troops, and convey recommendations to Congress. The reporter then visited Nolan. Mr. Nolan said that this trip was his first time, and before returning to the country to make a complete inspection report, it was not convenient to express sporadic opinions. However, he said that China's east coast is far away from his hometown of California across the Pacific Ocean. Based on the past friendship between China and the United States, the future friendship and connection between the two countries will continue to increase.

Leaving Shanghai for Singapore This Morning

The two, after a hurried journey, flew away from this city again at one o'clock this morning to Manila. It is said that they still have to travel to Singapore, Bangkok, Yangon, Calcutta, New Delhi, Bahrain, Cairo, Athens, Rome, Frankfurt, Paris, London and other places. If there are no climate changes along the way, they can be expected to return to Washington, DC in early February.

He once concealed his identity under a false name, but the law could not escape him, and he was finally captured by our police. At 2:30 PM yesterday, Judge Wu Shaochang of the District Court sentenced him to life imprisonment and deprived him of his civil rights for life. The defendant declared an appeal.

### Unlawful Police Extort Old Goods Stalls

[Our Newspaper] There are many old goods stalls in the Jinjiafang area of Minguo Road in the south of the city, about 400 stalls. After someone secretly reported that someone from the Yimiao Branch went to collect petty fees, Director Du of the branch, after investigation, immediately ordered Feng Shiying, a judicial officer, to disguise himself as a stall vendor and participate in it. Zhao Chunlin, who was in the old goods business, came to him and demanded a daily stall fee of 100 yuan. Feng gave him the money and immediately took him to the branch for interrogation. Zhao confessed everything. According to him, Li Fuhong, the head of the administrative section of the branch, Inspector Quan Desheng, and section member Zhang Jin ordered him to keep records of the collection of fees. A total of more than 400 vendors were charged 100 yuan per household per day, and 1.2 million yuan in legal tender was obtained per month.

It has been approved that during the consolidation period, applicants for industrial and commercial registration may wait until the bureau issues formal industrial and commercial registration certificates before submitting membership certificates from trade associations for verification.

### Public Utility Workers in This City Are Rising Up to Demand Improved Treatment - Labor and Management Are Waiting for Mediation from All Parties

[Our Newspaper] The six major public utilities in this city, after the government sent personnel to take over, were handed over to the original foreign merchants to operate. Because the treatment of Chinese and foreign employees is not the same, and the management cannot agree to the workers' proposed adjustments to wages and year-end bonuses, or they allow but cannot announce them, labor disputes have arisen one after another. The recent developments are as follows:

Electricity

The American-owned Power Company had a dispute because the workers demanded that the company fulfill the ten conditions agreed upon in September last year. Representatives from various party, government, and military agencies in the city convened four consultations between labor and management. Although some minor aspects such as improving welfare have been resolved satisfactorily, the most important aspects such as equal pay for equal work are not close to being resolved. Therefore, it was decided to submit the difficult-to-resolve issues to the Arbitration Committee for arbitration. Labor, management, and mediators will provide opinions separately. It is said that the three parties are actively collecting materials and evidence, and arbitration can begin in the short term.

Gas

More than 900 employees at the Yangshupu New Factory and the Xizang Road Old Factory of the British-owned Gas Company submitted a written request to the company on the 8th of this month, including a 19-point proposal including an eight-hour working day, annual bonuses, and retirement pay, limiting the reply to tomorrow [the 14th].

Telephone

Employees of the American-owned Telephone Company submitted a written request to the company authorities on October 30 last year, requesting multiple items such as salary adjustments. At that time, the company did not give a satisfactory answer. Now that the Lunar New Year is approaching, the employees requested the company to resolve the year-end bonus first on the 9th of this month and issue salaries in advance, limiting the company's reply to the 15th. It is said that the monthly salary of low-level employees of the company is about 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. As for improving the treatment of Chinese workers and equal pay for equal work, etc., we should wait for the mediation of the Social Affairs Bureau.

Tram

The British-owned Tram Company once had a strike. After the Social Affairs Bureau intervened, the workers' requests for increased wages and equal treatment with foreign employees were submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau and the company authorities in writing on the 7th of this month. Now more than 3,000 employees are waiting for mediation.

Seizing Guns While Attending a Wedding Feast

Director He of the Longhua Police Branch received a secret report yesterday that a large group of bandits were attending a wedding feast at Qian Meijia's house in Qianjiawan, Qibao Town, western Shanghai. He immediately sent Gao Rujun, the head of the judicial section, to lead the patrol police and the 88th Division soldiers. At about 6:00 PM yesterday, they arrived at Qianjiawan, first surrounding Qian's house and prohibiting entry and exit. Then they went inside to search. Except for those with gun licenses and supporting documents, they confiscated two pistols, three shotguns, and five suspects, including Xu Heshang, on the spot, and took them to the branch for interrogation along with Qian Mei.

### People's Livelihood Coal Management Office to Be Established Soon; Coal Briquette Factory Expected to Start Operations

The Shanghai District Fuel Management Committee, in order to stabilize the city's fuel supply, has initiated the establishment of a "People's Livelihood Coal Management Office." This office will be jointly organized by the Coal Industry and Coal Briquette Industry Associations to take charge of coal matters. Concrete agreements have been made, and it is expected to be formally established in the near future. At that time, all coal chunks, coal dust, and coal briquettes will be sold at the lowest prices in various districts to ordinary citizens whose monthly electricity consumption is below 30 degrees.

Various mechanized coal briquette factories have now gradually completed the repair of their machinery. However, they are hampered by an insufficient stockpile of white coal dust. Furthermore, due to electricity restrictions, some speculative coal merchants are collecting large amounts of coal slag and using hand-cranked machines to manufacture and sell low-quality coal briquettes to seek extra profits. Once the allocation of people's livelihood coal begins, all coal briquette factories will be able to start operations.

### Shanghai French Concession Arrest Case: We Raise Three Demands

Film and Drama

### Check the Roots First

— Shi Dongshan

I often see some old friends in the drama circle publishing articles in the newspapers, saying how bad the atmosphere among drama workers is now and that it should be improved. The articles do not cite specific events, and at first glance, they seem reasonable. Once, I happened to meet a few heads of theater troupes at a friend's house, and they were also talking about this so-called "atmosphere" problem. Everyone listed many events, complaining to each other, all with frustrated expressions or making regretful sighs. For a time, they found common ground in their conversation and felt very harmonious, as if they had found an opportunity to vent, and they suddenly felt a sense of mutual sympathy and pity. However, when someone calmly analyzed the events they mentioned from the side, it was felt that although there were indeed some issues related to the morality of individual comrades, most of them were due to the morality and leadership methods of the leaders—themselves—or the social environment.

If you want to improve anything, it is incorrect, unfair, and useless to focus on the branches instead of starting from the root. If the roots are bad, it will definitely affect the branches and leaves of the whole body. Therefore, if you find that most of the branches and leaves are diseased, it is best to check the roots first. The masses are the easiest to manage and the most difficult to manage. How do you say that? If the leaders can be strict with their own morality and leadership methods—sincere and honest, selfless, thinking of everyone, honestly serving everyone, doing what they say, honestly explaining the difficulties when they can't do it, not making promises lightly, being tolerant of others' criticism, humbly considering others' opinions, not acting unilaterally, not showing off, trying to persuade people as much as possible, not issuing orders forcibly, asking more about people's pain and difficulties, and trying to solve them for them... Just with these simple points that everyone can say, as long as you can do it, you can already make everyone服 you. In this way, the masses can become the easiest to manage; otherwise, the masses can become the most difficult to manage. At the same time, you must have a reasonable system to match your good morality, that is to say, you must not only have good "people" but also have good "laws" and "systems." The so-called good laws and systems must be able to communicate vertically and horizontally, not isolate superiors and subordinates, not allow each to act on their own, but be able to care for each other, encourage each other, and supervise each other to achieve the effect of collective wisdom and effort. (It's not that I'm being trendy, but it must be democratic.) Such a group cannot be run poorly. According to our experience and knowledge, there are only two reasons why a group is run poorly. First, is the so-called "if the upper beam is not straight, the lower beam will be crooked." The masses see that the matter is fundamental, but they can't help and are embarrassed or lack the courage to stage a "down with" or "overthrow," so at first they just complain verbally, and finally, they become depressed, passively resist work, and the rude ones inevitably act impulsively, so that everyone "橫竪橫, 拆牛棚". Second, is due to lack of vertical and horizontal communication (undemocratic practices), which leads to many misunderstandings, many disputes, and eventually chaos and collapse.

I always feel that there are relatively few bad elements, so in a group, as long as the leaders lead effectively, and the system is reasonably set, the law is established practically and precisely, and it can be used fairly and reasonably, such a group cannot be run poorly. If it is said that bad elements are most likely to affect the group, 出寧 say that good systems and good laws will definitely make the masses tend to be good, as long as the leaders have this vision and attitude and dare to open up democracy.

### Return of Spring to the Isolated Island

— Xu Xinqin

——A Dedication to Artists in Front and Rear Lines Suffering Eight Years; Proud Backbone Supported the Isolated Island Without Running Out of Road; Today the Country's Doors are Like a Sea of Spring; How Many Artists are Entering the Final Act.

When I was in the rear, I appreciated the drama and film work of the artists during the Anti-Japanese War, and although I only remembered some discontinuous play and film titles in my mind, I felt that their meaning was very profound. For example, the first time I saw "Children of China," then "Metamorphosis," then I visited the filming of "Ten Thousand Miles of the Long Sky," and I saw on stage "The Wind on the Border," the satirical play "Demons Dancing Wildly," the filmed "Phoenix City," "Long Live the Nation," "Nation Above All Else," "Magnificent Mountains and Rivers," until "Blood Splattered on Cherry Blossoms" and then "Return My Homeland." And I especially remember "Paradise of the Isolated Island," "Boundless Future," "Hometown of White Clouds," "Punishment," "Fog Chongqing," and "Miaofeng Mountain." As for "Night Journey," "Lili Grass," "One Year," and "The Return of the Wanderer in the Snowy Night," all the way to the recent "Around the Qingming Festival" and "Fragrant Grass End of the World." Because of these works, I feel exceptionally close to the artists. At that time, the drama and film works that were transmitted from Shanghai to the rear, in addition to appreciating them, I also pasted the instructions and drama reviews that I could get on a large "Drama Movement Collection" booklet, in order to show them to these friends when I meet them in the future, as an aid to conversation. I remember that I seemed to have seen all the artists in Kunming when victory was about to come.

I was in for years, and today I have returned to Shanghai. Most of the old and new friends in the drama and film industry have gradually encountered each other within a month, but unfortunately, due to work and personal matters, I have not yet been able to chat about my accumulated feelings. But at this time of the return of spring to the earth, I have gained the two armies of heaven and human warming!

Whether the artists are in the rear or on the isolated island, people seem to be not犬得意吧? Everyone likes to say: "The drama and film industry does not seem to have 　暖?"　則 I think that the workers always give 　暖 to the audience. Just as engineers and civil construction workers do not all build houses for themselves. So "Who is working hard for whom?" All the admiring audience will know! And the most direct comfort to the workers is probably the enthusiastic and eternally remembering　們群衆吧!

Workers do not have to be sad, at this time they should cheer up and "lead the way" for the spring of national victory. Because drama and film work is the vanguard of culture, especially please face the admiring masses! The masses are cheering for you! I hope you will give them a lot of　暖!

### "Eagle-Lion" Comes to Shanghai to Compete for the British Film Market

Since Germany's defeat and surrender and the end of the European War, the British side, like Hollywood, has been actively engaged in film production. It is expected that a large number of new films will soon be shipped overseas for public screening to compete with American films. They also attach great importance to the Western film market in Shanghai.

The Eagle-Lion Film Company, which came to Shanghai from Chongqing, is a joint organization of major British film studios, specializing in the distribution and screening of films. Recently, the company's representative in China, Tom Baker, led several staff members from Chongqing to Shanghai. They have rented a large building on the Bund to formally conduct business and begin negotiating the screening of British films with various cinemas at sea.

Cooperation with the United States Some of the new films produced by British factories in 1946 have already been shipped to China, and others are on their way. The Eagle-Lion Company is a large-scale organization that not only distributes productions but also represents British film studios in negotiating everything externally. It is said that the company's affiliated factories have established friendly terms with MGM, Paramount, and other major American film studios for the exchange of actors and directors. In the later stages of the Anti-Japanese War, the Eagle-Lion Company introduced several British films to Chongqing audiences, which received much praise, and now their sights are on Shanghai.

Shaw's Masterpiece Tom Baker told the press that he believes that British films will definitely gain a considerable position in Shanghai in the future. Because after the war, the new films produced by British factories are mostly masterpieces. For example, Shaw's famous "Caesar and Cleopatra" (Cesar and Cleopatra), starring Claudette Colbert and Vivien Leigh, is having its world premiere in the United Kingdom. Londoners have praised it as a masterpiece. In fact, it is indeed the greatest British film of 1945. It will soon be shipped to all parts of the world for public screening.

Producing a Masterpiece At the same time, Ingrid Bergman, who was recently selected as the best actress of 1945 in Hollywood, has been scheduled to star in the historical masterpiece "Mary Magdalene" (Mary Magdalene), produced by Chadwick and distributed by Eagle-Lion Company. All work is in active progress. The production cost of this film is estimated to be US$4 million. American newspapers have already introduced it in advance. It will be an extraordinary production in British films.

Film Screening Plan Baker further stated that in the coming year—1946—he plans to publicly screen at least 24 new films produced by British factories in Shanghai, an average of two films per month. All the films screened, regardless of their nature, content, subject matter, cast, and directors, will be selected as the best. In this way, the future British film market in Shanghai can be effectively laid a foundation.

### British Film Industry Tycoons Go to Film City to Select Beauties

British film industry tycoon Arren felt that it was not easy to find British beauties, so he had to visit Hollywood, which is world-renowned and has many beauties, at the beginning of this month to select real talents. Arren told a reporter from the Drama and Film Society: British film stars were not originally ugly, but their words and actions were too restrained, lacking the expression of sexual beauty, which is far inferior to the beauties of Hollywood. Arren's trip was very smooth, and he has obtained the consent of Ms. Ingrid, 十曼女士, and Ms. Zhong Fangting to play the leading roles in two films. At the same time, he agreed with American producers to exchange stars at any time. Arren also said: Britain not only lacks films that express sexual beauty, but also lacks such playwrights. Most of these playwrights live in the countryside and rarely interact with cities. They write in an ivory tower, and they are not as energetic as American playwrights. Therefore, works about love and sexual beauty will still have to be taken from American materials in the future, [American Correspondence from the Drama and Film Society]

New Film Introduction

### "Dream Girl"

— Wang Shen

"Dream Girl" is written and directed by 爱尔受·拉埃斯. In addition, he also赔出 的太太培丹·菲尔特 to play the leading role. As a result, a light-hearted and lively drama was made, and movie fans who paid to see the play would never complain冤枉.

When the curtain rises, Georgina Olerton, who is 23 years old, pretends to be an old maid. She thinks she is in love with her brother-in-law. Georgina runs a bookstore, and her brother is also in the printing industry. Later, she met a book and newspaper broker who was quite fond of her. This gentleman was very lively, but his thoughts were not very bright. Later, she met a literary critic who could write reviews without reading the original text.

The above-mentioned characters plus her parents are the most important roles around Georgina. Most of these people are dreamers in the air. This film is not only a comedy but simply a fantasy.

This Miss Georgina, who loves to fantasize, sometimes thinks of herself as Portia in Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice," singing of compassion and impartiality, and at another time, she is the mother of two 洋囡囡, suddenly she thinks of herself as the goddess who committed suicide by the roadside, and suddenly she fantasizes about messing around with a married man in Mexico. Finally, waking up from daydreaming, she only bought a toothbrush and a bag of snacks, and suddenly went to be a bride on her honeymoon. The double switch of the lens is very exciting, and it happens to keep up with Georgina's lively performance.

### Promote Children's Drama

— Wang Huaide

Not long ago, the authorities issued an order prohibiting children under the age of nine from entering久 theaters or cinemas. So, in a daily newspaper, I saw an article saying that the authorities' measures were still open to discussion. My view on this matter is different from that of the author of that article. I think that the plays performed in Shanghai's current theaters are not suitable for children to watch. The authorities' method is because they are afraid that the young minds of children will be affected by those "adult plays" and create future bad consequences, which undoubtedly has great significance.

I think, instead of prohibiting children from watching "adult plays," why not promote plays specifically for children to watch? Needless to say, there are excellent examples of this in European and American countries. But things abroad are too far away, and I don't want to say them one by one. Just the performance of children's operas in the Russian Emigrant Association in Shanghai can indeed be followed by us.

The author was invited by a friend to visit a children's opera at the Russian Emigrant Association. The so-called opera is that the actors are all small children, and only a few adults appear in unimportant roles. As for the plot of the performance, because the author does not know Russian, I naturally don't know what it is talking about, and I don't understand it at all; but judging from the plot, it is probably nothing more than containing education. Many innocent Russian children sometimes dance, sometimes sing, sometimes have dialogues, and sometimes have expressions on the stage; although it is inevitable that they are childish, it is good that the targets are all children. If they accidentally make a joke, it does not matter. It attracts a lot of laughter in the hall, and the general audience of children finds it more interesting. They—the little audience—come with their parents, and they often ask their parents questions, and the parents explain them in detail: it is rare to find this situation among Chinese parents.

We hope that there will be theaters dedicated to children, and plays performed by children themselves will appear. So that children have their own theaters and watch their own plays.

Editor's note: During the Anti-Japanese War, the Political Department organized a children's theater troupe for children who were displaced and homeless. The playwright Ling He once served as the head of the troupe. A group of innocent children learned and performed plays at the same time, which was praised by the public. Now, most of the young members of the troupe are already young men and women. Some continue to study, and some have joined professional or amateur theater troupes.

### Shanghai Drama School Dissolves

The Shanghai Drama School, which has been established for seven years, officially announced its dissolution a few days ago. Economic difficulties are the biggest reason. The drama school has cultivated many talents. In the future, they will meet the audience on the stage in an independent posture. There are still many students who have not graduated and have to drop out halfway and seek other achievements. This is very unfortunate news.

Weekly Film Review

### "Dragon Seed"

— Lai Ming

This is another new masterpiece by the American Ms. Pearl S. Buck after "The Good Earth." When the book was published, MGM Film Company immediately selected the best director and actors with suitable acting skills to produce the film. In this film, it depicts the history of the resistance of the people in the occupied areas of China to Japanese imperialism during this war, and the customs, habits, and plot of the play are extremely tactful and moving and lamentable.

This film is directed by two major directors, Jacques Conway and 皮斯寇脱, and their techniques are ultimately extraordinary. As for the actors, of course, we should first recommend Katharine Hepburn. She is an actress who has made a comeback. In playing the role of Jade, she fully exerted her acting skills. In this film, she has a scene of singing Chinese ditties, which is very Chinese in flavor. There is also a moment when Jade is in the countryside, preparing to poison many Japanese thieves, which is very tense. Finally, she and her husband, Lao Er, lead a group of villagers to destroy the garden. The fiery scene of the burning yard is particularly thrilling and very great. In addition, the director used majestic songs as the musical background, coupled with all the Chinese dialogues, which made the audience of our country even more suitable for understanding. Therefore, this is really a genuine imported Chinese film!

The new star Du Yingbei (one of the protagonists of Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves) plays Lao Er, the veteran film actor Walter Huston's Lin Dan, and Michael Murong's Lin's wife all perform with the beauty of珠聯璧合. The sensation of this film surpasses that of "The Good Earth" in the past, so it is a film that our people are值得 one to watch.

Reader's Letter

### New Widow Cries Injustice for Her Husband: Shot Dead by Police While Returning Home Late at Night

Mr. Editor: I am ashamed to live, unable to die. Now I have become the most unfortunate and pitiful new widow in the world. In my current living environment, I am indeed barely surviving, destined to become a starving corpse in the future. I believe that all compatriots with compassion will not remain indifferent. Therefore, I dare to appeal to all citizens here. The truth is this: How did I become a new widow? Alas! It is painful to say. On the evening of the 25th of last month, at about 10:00 PM, my son Gongxia (6 years old) woke up and cried incessantly, demanding snacks. My husband, Qian Chu, went out to buy something. When he returned to the alley entrance, two armed policemen were waiting there. Seeing my husband, they ordered him to stop. It was raining and dark, making it difficult to distinguish. This caused my husband to misunderstand. He panicked and fled towards Yuanfang Lane. Unfortunately, he was shot dead by Xu Xianzong, a member of the judicial section of the Changning District Police Bureau, without asking any questions. Not only did the section member not show remorse, but he also falsely accused my husband of being a gambler, attempting to evade his own legal sanctions. Heavens! My husband was not a notorious bandit. In fact, he had no weapons and could have been pursued. Instead, they could have fired a warning shot into the air. Now, after victory, is this how our people's safety is guaranteed?

Mr. Editor: Think about it for me. There is a 71-year-old mother-in-law at home, and five children, the oldest daughter being 21 years old, and the youngest only 2 years old. With my intelligence and ability, how can I maintain our daily food? On the other hand, I cannot seek justice for my husband. Ashamed to be Qian's wife, the bitterness in my heart is difficult to express. In a situation where "there is no door to heaven, no way to earth," the only thing I can do is appeal to society, asking all citizens to judge fairly with a spirit of justice. I believe that "people are not made of wood or stone, how can they bear to sit idly by." Therefore, I shout out as my last appeal, fathers and elders of the city, quickly come and rescue this most unfortunate and pitiful new widow in the world! This is my sincere hope. Qian Lumeiling, anxiously awaiting assistance in seeking justice for her husband.
