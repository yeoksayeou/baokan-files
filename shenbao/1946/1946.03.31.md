### Zhang Fakui Speaks

Guangzhou City is Peaceful and Tranquil, War Criminal Ximen Will Be Escorted to Chongqing

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 29th] Statement by Zhang Fakui, Director of the Xingying (Provisional Headquarters): (1) Troop reorganization has already begun, and there are already arrangements for the reassignment of surplus officers. In the past two weeks, military discipline inspections have been carried out, and the largest number of detainees are police officers, followed by local teams and troops. This shows that the quality of military discipline is greatly related to treatment, so I have proposed that military personnel must receive higher pay equal to that of civil officials. (2) In recent months, there have been no bandits entrenched in the Xingying's jurisdiction, only a few who have fled to the border areas of Hunan and Jiangxi. Public security in this city has not yet reached an ideal state, but order in the city is more peaceful. (3) The Japanese prisoners will be completely repatriated before April 15th. According to the promulgated list, there are eight batches of war criminals here, totaling 112 people. Sixty-five have been arrested. German spy Otto and Italian female spy Bianca have both been arrested. Traitor war criminal Ximen has also been interrogated by the Xingying and may be escorted to Chongqing for handling. As for political prisoners, the Xingying has never arrested anyone other than traitors. I have never interfered with personal beliefs. If the Xingying arrests or fails to release political prisoners, I will be responsible for violating national laws. (4) The wages and food expenses of requisitioned employees have been increased, and will be increased or decreased from time to time according to the price index in the future. At the same time, in order to quickly restore transportation in South China, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has been requested to dispatch the Hai Kang, Hai E, and Hai Bai, three large transport ships, to regularly sail along the coastal lines of South China.

Due to health reasons, Mao is not planning to take on important positions in the coalition government, and even the most important meetings of the Politburo are currently not attended by Mao. Mao's condition has recently improved, and is currently being treated by several Soviet doctors.

### Road Repair Work is Intermittent, Management Rights Remain Deadlocked, Unexpectedly Significant Material Losses

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 30th] The restoration of transportation is progressing slowly. The issue of railway management rights has not yet been completely resolved. Government representatives insist that current railway employees in the Communist areas must also be screened before being employed. Communist representatives insist that if screening is carried out, it must be done uniformly in all recovered areas, so the matter remains deadlocked. Tomorrow, Sunday, three-party personnel from the Executive Headquarters will take the train to Qinglongqiao to visit the Great Wall.

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 30th] North of Yancheng on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, under the supervision of the 23rd Transportation Group, repairs have now been completed to Wangjiazhuang, advancing two kilometers and leaving six kilometers to Yucheng. The project continued as usual yesterday despite it being a day off. Currently, the progress of the project is less than 800 meters of repaired section per day. It is expected that it will still take ten days to reach Yucheng. On the southern section, repairs have been completed to Yunting, advancing just over one kilometer and leaving seven kilometers to Dawenkou, and repairs are continuing. After repairing to Xindian on the Jiaoji Railway, the Communist Army stopped the repairs, and a solution has not yet been found.

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 30th] It has recently come to light, according to sources from certain parties, that if the railway repair project in Shandong Province were carried out according to the government's original plan, as of now, it could have been repaired as far south as Yanzhou, as far north as Dezhou, and as far east as Weixian. Due to the influence of the Communist Army's constant introduction of new issues, the project has been intermittent. To date, the total length of the repaired section is less than 20 kilometers. As for the material aspect, the Road Administration originally estimated a maximum loss of about 20 percent, but the actual situation is the opposite. Since the resumption of road repairs, the steel rails, railroad ties, and other materials that the Communist Army removed and stored have never been handed over at all. Therefore, when the repair project continues in the future, the lack of equipment will still be a major problem.

### Kyuichi Tanaka Detained, Repents of Past Crimes

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 28th] (Delayed) Lieutenant General Kyuichi Tanaka, the head of the Japanese military and civilian liaison department here, has been listed as the 52nd war criminal in the third batch by the Military Commission. The Guangzhou Xingying was ordered to detain him on the 27th.

When he was detained, the criminal entrusted Captain Li of the Xingying's Anti-Enemy Broadcasting Team to forward his personal letter to Director Zhang. The letter roughly stated that the Japanese prisoners had been successively repatriated to their country and that his mission was also completed. He deeply repented of his past actions and was now awaiting punishment without complaint.

### National Congress Representatives of Hebei Province to Be Selected by the National Government

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 30th] As the National Congress is about to be convened, the National Government, in view of the actual difficulties faced by the provinces and cities that have not yet held National Congress elections, most of which have failed to elect representatives in time, has changed its approach and will have the National Government select them. The Hebei Provincial Government has received this order, has concluded the election affairs, and has ordered all districts and counties to cease operations.

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 30th] The quota of social elites for National Congress representatives was originally only 30, but all parties believe that the quota is too small to accommodate everyone. There is a recent proposal to increase the quota by 150.

### National Army, Centered on Shenyang, Advances Towards Soviet Withdrawal Zone; Tianzhuangtai Branch Line Closes in on Yingkou

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 30th] According to sources involved, the National Army, centered on Shenyang, is currently advancing in a radiating manner towards the areas withdrawn by the Soviet Army. The National Army northeast of Shenyang is advancing along the Changchun Railway and has reached Tieling, pressing towards Kaiyuan. Once the Soviet Army withdraws from Changchun, there should be no problem with taking over Changchun. The National Army south of Shenyang is pointing towards Yingkou in a pincer formation, advancing along the Tianzhuangtai branch line of the Beining Railway. It has already approached the outskirts of Yingkou a few days ago. The National Army may have already entered Yingkou today, but the authorities have not yet released any information on this. Another route is going south along the Changchun Railway, passing Anshan and pointing towards Yingkou from the northeast. The newly recovered areas by the National Army in the Northeast, such as Liaoyang and Anshan, have been severely damaged.

In other news, the Communist Army is currently gathering its forces south of Gongzhuling towards Changtu, attempting to launch a large-scale offensive to prevent government troops from moving north to take over.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 30th] The most concerning issue for people here now is whether the National Army advancing north from Shenyang can reach Changchun before the Soviet Army completely withdraws.

It is reported that a portion of the Soviet Army has been transferred back to Siberia, but the majority of the Soviet Army leaving the Northeast is heading to Korea, which has aroused the concern of the Chinese government. At the same time, the Soviet Union is greatly strengthening its presence in Lushun and Dalian. According to authoritative sources here, although there are currently no signs that the Soviet Union is not complying with the agreement to complete the withdrawal before May, President Chiang is deeply concerned about the Soviet actions in concentrating in Korea.

[Associated Press, Beiping, 30th] The receiving officials dispatched to Changchun by the government feel that it is not safe to stay in Changchun, and almost all of them have evacuated today, the second group evacuation since last November. According to the Central News Agency, the last batch of evacuating officials, about 100 people, will fly from Changchun to Jinzhou Northeast Xingying today aboard a transport plane. The number of Chinese officials evacuating has gradually increased with the news of the Soviet Army withdrawing north to Harbin and the Communist Army entering Changchun. Mayor Zhao and city government officials do not seem to be leaving. According to his claim three weeks ago, the garrison in Changchun has 11,000 men, but none of them are central troops. 4,000 of them were airlifted from Beiping, 3,000 were puppet police formerly employed by the Japanese, and another 4,000 were recruited locally.

### Awaiting Direct Reply from the Soviet Union: Security Council Adjourns for Four Days, Iranian Representative Demands Soviet Guarantee of Troop Withdrawal, Bevin to Personally Travel to the US if Necessary

[Our Dispatch] London, 30th (Broadcast): It was reliably learned from diplomatic sources here today that British Foreign Secretary Bevin recently telegraphed US Secretary of State Byrnes, stating that if the crisis in the Security Council threatens the existence of the United Nations, he will travel to New York. Bevin stated that due to his busy schedule, he does not intend to leave London at present, but if the situation urgently requires a trip to New York, he will depart immediately upon notification.

[United Press, 29th] In an effort to break the deadlock caused by the Soviet Union's boycott of meetings, the United Nations Security Council unanimously decided today to directly request Moscow and Tehran to report on the Soviet-Iranian dispute and set a deadline of next Wednesday for a response. This was proposed by US Secretary of State Byrnes, and the key question was whether the Soviet promise to withdraw troops was contingent on agreements regarding other matters. Australia proposed that the deadline for the response should be Wednesday or Thursday, but Byrnes argued for an earlier deadline of next Tuesday. Ultimately, under the guidance of Mr. Guo Taiqi, who was present, it was decided to set the deadline for Wednesday. The meeting adjourned at 11:00 AM, and the letter requesting a response from the Soviet Union and Iran was sent out half an hour later. Today was the third meeting that the Soviet representative had not attended. The Security Council had decided at a closed-door meeting on Thursday that the meetings would continue even in the absence of the Soviet representative. Byrnes stated that if the Security Council could obtain more comprehensive information, it could be certain that the withdrawal of Soviet troops was in fact unconditional. Immediately after Byrnes finished his speech, British representative Cadogan expressed his agreement. Byrnes's proposal seemed to be forcing a showdown with the Soviet Union, attempting to determine how long it would take and to what extent the Soviet Union would deny the Security Council access to information regarding the situation in Iran. However, as the Soviet representative was not present, it was impossible to make a verbal request directly. The US motion was intended to test the Soviet Union's reaction to a written statement, in order to determine whether the Soviet Union would also boycott this. During today's meeting, Polish representative Lange asked how the Iranian Prime Minister was able to travel to Moscow a few weeks ago, given that the Iranian constitution stipulates that no negotiations can take place while foreign troops remain in the country. Iranian Ambassador to the US Ala replied that the Prime Minister went to Moscow to seek an end to Soviet interference in Iranian affairs and urged Marshal Stalin and Foreign Minister Molotov to pay attention to the continued presence of Soviet troops in Iran, as such a situation would lead to continued chaos. Although the Prime Minister enjoyed numerous banquets in Moscow, there were no concessions made.

[Reuters, New York, 30th] Iranian representative Ala stated at the United Nations Security Council open meeting last night that the Soviet Union should provide the Council with an unconditional guarantee that Soviet troops will completely withdraw from Iran within the specified timeframe. Last night's meeting lasted three hours and forty-eight minutes. Ala declared at the meeting that no official or other information had been received regarding the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Iran into Soviet territory.

### The Soviet Union of Course Trusts the UN Organization Today! But Believes the Security Council's Actions Are Unfriendly

The Soviet reaction strongly indicates that the Soviet Union will refuse to provide the information requested by the Security Council. When asked if the Soviet Union would continue to trust the UN organization, they replied, "Of course! Stalin made it clear that the Soviet Union trusts the UN organization in a talk on March 22."

### Truman Sends Letter to Stalin Introducing New Ambassador

Does Not Involve Other Issues

[US News, Washington, 29th] White House Press Secretary Ross stated at a press conference today that the letter carried by the new US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, General Smith, from President Truman to Marshal Stalin, was a routine letter from one head of state to another introducing a new ambassador.

### Paris Peace Conference May Not Be Convened as Scheduled

[Our Dispatch] London, 30th (Broadcast): French government sources today expressed private opinions that the peace conference may not be convened as scheduled on May 1. Observers believe that the disputes in the Security Council have almost completely eliminated the opportunity to begin work. The French government sent notes to the UK, the US, and the Soviet Union a week ago, inquiring whether the preliminary preparations for the peace treaty must be completed before May 1, but has not received a response. As France is the convener, it must send invitations to the 21 countries by early April.

[Washington, 29th] The US government has agreed to France's proposal to have France invite representatives from various countries to hold a peace conference in Paris on May 1.

### Canadian Spy Case

Third Investigative Report

Another Fourteen People Charged

[United Press, Ottawa, 29th] The Canadian Atomic Spy Investigation Committee released its third interim report today, stating that evidence has been obtained indicating that the Soviet secret police had a secret organization operating in Canada under its command as early as July 1943. The report also accused five people of passing Canadian military secrets to the spy ring. The total number of people accused in the three reports is fourteen. Communist Member of Parliament Rose remained in jail for the second night due to his inability to provide cash bail for release. One of the five people accused this time is Professor Hale Bilinkoff of Mathematics at Queen's University, who has been apprehended by Army Major Wei. Hai was involved in numerous secret projects in the military, some of which were extremely important, with only a few people knowing their code names. However, Wei used his position to review all files and documents related to weapons, explosives, and various new discoveries used by artillery units.

### Soviet Spy Arrested in the US Has Been Released on Bail Awaiting Summons

### Hurley Delivers a Speech: The Sacred Atlantic Charter Has Been Violated and Discarded, Countries Abandon US Goals and Ideals, US Military Organization Gradually Becomes Weak and Incompetent

[United Press, Washington, 30th] Former US Ambassador to China Hurley stated in a speech at the Joint Air Defense Conference hosted by the National Aviation Association today that we once told US soldiers to fight for certain doctrines and goals, but to this day, the United States has tacitly agreed to abandon these doctrines and goals. The sacred provisions of the Atlantic Charter have been violated and discarded. Major powers have clearly shown that what they need is US money, materials, and military power, but they disregard US ideals and goals, which they had previously agreed to. China is the only country that has not abandoned these ideals and goals. The State Department has agreed to give all lend-lease materials to other countries and sell off overseas army equipment, but I advocate that the United States should immediately recover these materials. US weapons should be used by the international police of UN organizations. The US military organization has gradually become weak and incompetent. The Army, Navy, and Air Force should be merged into one national defense agency, and future military plans should not be limited to men, but should also include women, and military thinking should be refreshed.

### Riots Erupt in Various Places on the Eve of the Greek Elections

Moscow Radio broadcast today that although the Greek elections have observation groups from the US, UK, and France, they lack the necessary foundation for free, legitimate, and orderly elections.

[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 30th] On the eve of the Greek elections, riots have erupted in various places. The magistrate of Agrinio County in the province of Aetolia-Acarnania has urgently telegraphed the government, requesting the rapid dispatch of additional constabulary reinforcements. Details are unknown.

### UNRRA Council Concludes: New Director-General LaGuardia Delivers Speech, US Resolves to Cooperate in Saving the World from Disaster

[Central News Agency, Atlantic City, 29th (United Press)] At the conclusion of the three-week UNRRA Council meeting here, LaGuardia told the participating representatives that President Truman is determined to fully support the work of UNRRA and is willing to save the world from disaster to the best of its ability. Like his predecessor Lehman, LaGuardia called for the United States to restore food rationing and pointed out that the food wasted in New York alone is enough to feed 350,000 people. LaGuardia emphasized the need for recipient countries to eliminate the black market and assured that UNRRA stands outside the political vortex. "We will never approach people with a ballot box in one hand and food in the other." LaGuardia said that he will assume office on April 1.

### Control of Atomic Energy Power: US Atomic Energy Commission Suggests Handing Over to the International Atomic Energy Agency

[Central News Agency, Washington, 29th (United Press)] The US State Department Atomic Energy Commission submitted a 25,000-word report to Secretary of State Byrnes, suggesting that the power to control atomic energy for peaceful and progressive purposes should be handed over to the International Atomic Energy Development Commission under the United Nations Organization. The report stated that it is not advisable to have an international police force control atomic energy to prevent its use in war, and that only by giving the International Atomic Energy Development Agency the power to control atomic energy raw materials and even factories producing atomic energy, can it be effective. The State Department reiterated that the above report and recommendations are only drafts and not final plans.

[United Press, Washington, 30th] US Senators Austin and Hoffman stated today that they oppose the disclosure of information about atomic energy until absolute guarantees are obtained that atomic energy will not be used for war. The two's position clearly clashes with the State Department's plan to establish an international atomic energy development agency. Hoffman said that unless all countries within UN organizations treat the United States with the same open-mindedness, we will not disclose the slightest secret about atomic energy.

### Civilian Control of Atomic Energy: Committee Declared Established

[United States Information Service, Washington, 30th] The National Committee for Civilian Control of Atomic Energy was declared established this week.

The committee's immediate goal is to have the House of Representatives abolish the Johnson Bill and the Senate abolish Vandenberg's amendment to the McMahon Bill.

### A Batch of French Troops Arrive in Vietnam, Landing in Hoi An

Political Assassinations Occur Repeatedly in Cochinchina

[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 29th] It is learned that the French cruiser "Gloire," with the consent of the Vietnamese authorities, landed a batch of French troops in the port of Hoi An on the 26th.

[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 29th] Dr. Tran Dan Phap, a member of the Cochinchina Advisory Council, was shot four times this morning by two thugs and died on the spot. The names of the perpetrators are unknown. Dr. Tran ardently advocated autonomy for Cochinchina during his lifetime, and people in the autonomy faction have consistently opposed holding elections in Cochinchina. Therefore, it is said that due to the repeated political assassinations recently, people are hesitant to vote, so the elections must be postponed.

### Keenan and Zhe Jun Return to Tokyo

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 29th Special Dispatch] Mr. Keenan, the Chief Prosecutor of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East (IMTFE) for the United States, and his party have returned to Tokyo today after a short trip to China to collect evidence. Xiang Zherong, Chinese Prosecutor at the IMTFE, and others came along.

### US Senator Proposes Bill to Cancel Atomic Bomb Tests

[United Press, Washington, 29th] Democratic Senator Huff Monn today proposed a bill to directly cancel atomic bomb tests on Bikini Atoll. It is said that this does not indicate a lack of martial spirit. Canceling the tests is fundamentally justified. The United Nations organization is still in its infancy, and making large-scale preparations for a future war is incompatible with the purpose of the United States or any other country. It is also inconceivable that the United States would even indicate its willingness to prepare for atomic warfare in the distant future.

### Far Eastern Commission Cables MacArthur, Advocates Postponement of Japanese General Election, Expresses Doubt About Several Points in Japanese Draft Constitution, Holds Special Meeting Yesterday to Discuss MacArthur's Reply

[United Press, Washington, 29th] According to authoritative reports, the Far Eastern Commission sent two notes to MacArthur, "containing accusatory language," requesting that he provide details on the ratification of the Japanese Constitution and the reasons for allowing Japan to hold a general election on April 10. According to one authoritative source, "The wording of the notes is extremely careful, but it still expresses the committee's dissatisfaction with MacArthur's decision to make policy decisions without consulting the committee." In the first note, the committee requested that MacArthur explain whether the Japanese people understand that MacArthur's approval of the new Japanese Constitution may not be the final decision. The second note requested that MacArthur announce the reasons for his permission to hold elections on April 10 and why it cannot be postponed.

[United Press, Washington, 29th] The Japanese election is scheduled for April 10. The Far Eastern Commission members suggested a postponement, and MacArthur has replied. A special meeting will be held tomorrow to study it. According to diplomatic sources, the commission's cable to MacArthur is sufficient to reflect the views of some members, because the Japanese people are not familiar with democratic habits, and there are concerns about whether they can fully express their opinions in the election on April 10. It is said that several committee members did express doubts about several points in the proposed constitution. The committee was organized in accordance with the conditions announced by the three foreign ministers in Moscow in December last year, and it adopts a strict policy of secrecy. Its organizational basis is roughly based on the United Nations Security Council, with the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and China having veto power over policy directives, but France does not. The cable to MacArthur this time was likely obtained with the unanimous agreement of the four countries' committee members.

### Ribbentrop: A Series of Nonsense

### Discussing the Implementation of the New Land Policy (Part 1)

— Tao Qiwu

In the political report resolution passed by the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee, the eighth item regarding the vigorous implementation of policies, "Immediately stipulate the implementation steps and methods for 'land to the tiller,' the government shall issue land value bonds, purchase land from large landlords, distribute it to demobilized soldiers and poor farmers, earnestly support self-cultivating farmers, and protect tenant farmers." Although this decision seems to be just old news, it also shows that the Kuomintang already feels that the rural land problem has reached the point where it must be resolved quickly. This is truly the greatest problem for national construction in the future! It is also the most urgent problem!

Originally, more than three-quarters of our country's population are farmers, and the agricultural problem is the focus of the entire economic problem, and the solution of the land problem is a prerequisite for solving the agricultural problem. The main reason for internal strife and revolutions in China throughout history has often been the result of farmer unrest caused by unstable living conditions. Mencius said: "Benevolent government must begin with the establishment of boundaries. If the boundaries are not correct, the land will not be equal, and the salaries will not be fair. Therefore, tyrannical monarchs and corrupt officials must blur their boundaries. Once the boundaries are corrected, the division of land and the system of salaries can be determined while sitting down." Although these are words from the feudal era, his true insight has thoroughly explained the importance of the land problem. In short, the solution of the land problem has always been valued by successive dynasties in our country. If the solution is appropriate, the people will live in peace and the society will be stable; otherwise, there will be chaos. During the eight-year War of Resistance, the whole country, from top to bottom, realized that our country failed to establish light and heavy industries early on, and therefore wasted many heavy prices. After a long period of sacrifice, we were able to achieve final victory. This kind of realistic lesson forces the government and the public to unite and realize that post-war China must be industrialized. However, it must be known that the foundation of industrialization must be built on a broad agriculture. Only then will the sources of industrial raw materials be not scarce, and the industrial products will also have a broad agricultural market to sell. If the land problem cannot be reasonably resolved, agricultural production cannot be increased, and rural areas cannot be stable and prosperous, the purchasing power of most farmers will be extremely weak. Then, not only will the so-called "industrialization" be a castle in the air, without any basis, but also the result of letting some industrial and commercial sectors develop abnormally will lead to the struggle for raw materials and markets, causing greater crises, and even causing the country to go the wrong way, resulting in disaster, just like the past of Japan. Wallace said: "The strong industrial power of the United States was originally built on a broad countryside." At the beginning of national construction, with everything waiting to be done, the government is planning for long-term peace and stability. Reiterating this famous saying of the former Vice President of the United States should have profound significance. Any land system must have its time and space. A system that is effective in one country may not be effective in another country; similarly, a system that is very effective in one era may have the opposite result when implemented in another era. Therefore, the method of studying and solving the land problem cannot stick to the established rules of the ancients, or simply copy the superficial aspects of foreign countries, forcing ancient and modern China and foreign countries into one pattern. However, the occurrence of a country's land problem must have its historical origin and background, and whether the method of solving the land problem is appropriate is also related to its current environment and the trend of the world. Therefore, to study and solve the current rural land problem in our country, it is necessary to briefly review history and refer to general international trends and inclinations.

Our country has a long history, and the land problem occurred the earliest. The Zhou Dynasty advocated the well-field system. Mencius said: "A square mile is a well, and a well is 900 acres. The middle is the public field, and eight families each privately have 100 acres, supporting the public field together." The essence of the well-field system is here. Descending to the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, the population became more numerous, and the powerful and wealthy annexed land. Land was privately owned, and production capacity greatly increased. Qin Shang Yang took advantage of the situation and abolished the well-field system. As a result, land could be openly and freely bought and sold, and the landlord and merchant classes rose one after another, leading to a situation where those with land did not cultivate it, and those who could cultivate it had no land. The gap between the rich and the poor was huge, and society was uneasy. Subsequently, successive rulers mostly paid full attention to the issue of land distribution. Dong Zhongshu's land restriction system in the Han Dynasty, Wang Mang's Wangtian system, Emperor Wu of Jin's land occupation system, Emperor Xiaowen of the Wei Dynasty's equal-field system, the Tang Dynasty's land allocation system, and Emperor Taizu of the Song Dynasty's equal-field method were all quite acknowledging public ownership of land and using the method of distributing land according to the population (the details were often different). The purpose was to encourage production, prevent annexation, and increase national tax revenue. Here, there is a trend that can be noted, that is, the adjustment of various land systems often occurs at the time of a change of dynasty, after a great chaos, when the population is displaced, and the farmland is barren. The distribution of land according to the population has two major prerequisites: one is that the household registration must be clearly investigated, and the second is that there must be sufficient arable land to allocate. After a great chaos, the population is small, and it is easy to investigate as people are successively appeased and return, and the barren farmland and the land seized from the enemy's order can be re-allocated and supplied without shortage, so the implementation of the new system is always effective at the beginning. As for the destruction of various systems, it mostly occurs when there is a long period of peace, the population increases, the powerful and wealthy gradually annex land, and there is not enough land to distribute. If things are not fair, there will be grievances, so the peasants riot, the order is broken, causing turmoil. As a result, a new dynasty is replaced, and the land is re-adjusted, cycling back and forth, circulating to this day. This is the biggest reason for the one-rule-one-chaos in Chinese history.

The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, close to the Republic of China, also tried to implement a land distribution system. The method was to divide the land into nine grades according to the amount of production. Those who received land were distributed according to the number of people, regardless of gender. Each family had half good and half bad land, without differences. The so-called "The land of the world is cultivated by the people of the world together. If it is insufficient here, then move it there. If it is insufficient there, then move it here. Also, the land of the world is connected in barrenness and abundance. If it is barren here, then move it to the abundant place to provide relief here. If it is barren there, then move it to the abundant place to provide relief there." The purpose is to cultivate the land together, eat the food together, wear the clothes together, and use the money together, so that no one is unequal, and no one is not full and warm. In addition to "public land," there is also a method of "equalizing wealth and poverty," with far-reaching intentions. Unfortunately, the Heavenly Kingdom was not established for long, and after its failure, various institutions and cultural relics were thoroughly eliminated by the Qing Dynasty, leaving nothing behind. Therefore, its detailed methods and implementation results, in addition to being able to collect some information from various sporadic records, are almost impossible to see in their entirety.

There is no country in the world that does not have a land problem, but the severity of the problem must be proportional to the population size, land supply, and distribution system. If the population is small and the land is large (such as the tropical, north and south polar regions of Africa, etc.), there will be no problem at all. If there are many people, but the natural land supply is sufficient, or if the area of arable land can be expanded and production can be increased through human efforts and scientific methods, then even if there are problems, they will not be so profound. If the population is dense, the arable land is small, and the distribution system is unreasonable, then it is the most serious. Speaking of the methods of solving the land problem in various countries, there are many differences due to different histories and different national conditions, but looking at the overall trend, it can be roughly divided into two categories: the first is to completely abolish the private ownership of land, completely recover it to the state, and adopt a collective farm system, operating on a large scale with scientific methods, so that agricultural management is industrialized, as implemented by the Soviet Union; the second is to appropriately recognize the private ownership of land, but to restrict management with laws, so that the distribution is more reasonable, to reduce the drawbacks of monopoly and annexation, as implemented by Ireland and Eastern European countries. The first type of public land system originally coincided with the ideal of Chinese history, plus modern technical management (this point was not available in previous dynasties). The second type of system, our land law also has the principles of supporting self-cultivating farmers and limiting land ownership, etc., but unfortunately it has not been implemented so far.

Our country is called a large country with a large population, but in fact, although the land is large, there is not much arable land, and the population is really large. With a large population crowded on a small and limited arable land, production is not enough to supply consumption, plus frequent wars and poor distribution system, so by the eve of the War of Resistance, the land problem was already quite serious, especially in the southeastern region, where the situation of tenancy was particularly bad. The rich had thousands of acres of land, and the poor had no land to stand on. In the past, the government did not have a thorough solution to this, the social divide was obvious, and there were too many people dissatisfied with the status quo, who could cause incidents at any time. The reason why it did not break out was that the general tenants and hired farmers, although they had the same pain, did not have a clear class consciousness, let alone a large organization. During the eight-year War of Resistance, through conscription or involvement in guerrilla work, the opportunities for contact with each other increased day by day. After a long period of training in the army life, the level of knowledge was completely different from before. After returning to their homes, it would be difficult to make these soldiers from the countryside safely go back to their hometowns and restore the original tenant farming life. Moreover, before the war, there were imperialism and its attached feudal forces rampant in the country, and the government had various internal and diplomatic concerns, and sometimes it was really unable to let go and do things. After this eight-year War of Resistance, two-thirds of the country became war zones (including the Northeast), landlords fled, people were displaced, maps were lost, land registration was chaotic, and the original distribution system was completely destroyed. The government should take this opportunity to implement a moderate social revolution before the old order collapses and a new order is established, and thoroughly implement the land policy of the Principle of People's Livelihood.

Chairman Chiang once declared: "The day of victory in the War of Resistance will be a good opportunity to promote the land policy of the Principle of People's Livelihood." The sixth article of the political program and policies resolved by the Sixth National Congress of the Kuomintang regarding the Principle of People's Livelihood is "In addition to public land, farmland should be implemented with the most rapid and effective method, allowing the tiller to have his own land. All non-self-cultivated land shall be gradually purchased and distributed by the state issuing land bonds." In addition, the "Soldier Land Grant Program" was also passed. These are all expressions of the Changju's determination to implement a new land policy. How should we grasp this golden opportunity that will disappear in a flash, determine a practical and feasible plan, and implement it to lead the country to long-term peace and stability? (To be continued tomorrow)

Huzhou

Hutian Spring Flowers All Submerged

The townships in the Huzhou area have suffered great damage due to eight years of trampling by enemy puppets, so the cultivation of spring flowers this year is quite common. However, continuous spring rain has lasted for nearly a month, and all low-lying farmland crops such as rapeseed, silkworms, beans, and wheat have been submerged. The spring flower harvest is completely hopeless.

Pinghu

Public Announcement of Enemy Puppet Property Bidding Fees

The enemy puppet property in the county includes more than 500 shih of rapeseed, a rice milling machine set, and a small boat. The property was sealed by officials from the Zhejiang office of the Enemy Puppet Property Administration Bureau of Su, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and entrusted to the county Provisional Assembly for safekeeping. Now, a letter has been received from the bureau stating that the central government has approved the bidding sale and instructed the county to first investigate the price of the materials and then schedule the sale. It is said that the official announcement of the bidding sale can be made at the end of this month.

Wujiang

Lake Water Rises Sharply, Famine is Inevitable

Wujiang is a land of swamps, and the terrain is extremely low. Recently, continuous spring rain has caused the river water to rise sharply. The fields bordering Taihu Lake are more than five feet deep. The number of temporary shacks that have been washed away is unknown, and the number of people crying from hunger and cold is increasing day by day. The situation is unbearable to witness. Rapeseed and wheat have been completely submerged, and the spring harvest is hopeless. A famine is inevitable. If the weather does not clear up in the next few days, I am afraid that the highlands will also become swamps.

### Direct Consumers Do Not Benefit Much, Speculators and Arbitrageurs Abound, Suspension of the Sale of Low-Priced Flour, Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Decides to Change Handling Methods from Tomorrow, Strengthen Free Relief, Monthly Supply of 100,000 Bags in Shanghai

The Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Office in China held a joint meeting on the 29th. As a result, it was decided to change the flour handling method from April 1st: (1) Increase the quantity required for free emergency relief and work relief, (2) Stop supplying low-priced sales in this city. The Relief and Rehabilitation Administration distributes various grains such as flour, wheat bran, etc. Among them, flour is the most important, the purpose of which is to relieve a large number of poor people with meager incomes. It has been supplied for three months, although it has not been without success, but direct consumers still do not benefit much, and speculators and arbitrageurs abound, making profits in resale, which is very hateful. In view of this, the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration had to change their methods and decided to stop selling. The Relief and Rehabilitation Administration in Shanghai distributes about 60,000 bags of flour per month for emergency relief and work relief. In the future, it will be increased to 100,000 bags.

Wang Renlin, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Sub-Administration, told reporters yesterday that the US military has allocated 10,000 tons of surplus materials of dry milk, which is prepared to relieve children, toddlers, patients, students in various schools, and malnourished poor people in the city. The distribution method is currently being considered, and it will be implemented at the beginning of next month.

### First General Meeting of the Shanghai Provisional Municipal Council: Mayor Qian Reports on Municipal Administration, Hosts All Councilors

(Report from this Newspaper) The Shanghai Provisional Municipal Council held its first general meeting yesterday morning at 9:15 AM. Secretary-General Xiang Changquan reported: (1) Thirty councilors were present, exceeding the legal quorum. (2) According to a telegram from the Executive Yuan, alternate councilors may attend and observe, but will not receive military horse expenses. (3) Ten proposals have been received. (4) Councilors Shen Chunhui and four others proposed an interim motion regarding the death of Councilor Zhao Zhiqing, suggesting (1) the entire assembly stand in silent tribute for one minute to express condolences, (2) a delegation be sent to comfort the family, and (3) a telegram be sent to the Executive Yuan requesting generous allocation of funeral expenses and a condolence payment, to be handled by the secretariat. This was approved by the entire assembly.

Subsequently, Mayor Qian attended and reported on the administrative policy, first offering suggestions. He hoped that the councilors would pay attention to the time issue, noting that although the fourteen-day meeting schedule could be flexible, there were numerous proposals and the examination and discussion would take a long time. He also stated that the Civil Affairs Bureau was a staff agency and not independently established, so it could be included in his report. The Accounting Office was related to finance, so it would be included in the financial report. The Mayor's report was divided into two parts:

General Administrative Overview

Security Issues: In the early days after the recovery of the city, bandits were rampant in the suburbs. However, the garrison troops were mostly of a mobile nature. The municipal government strengthened the police force and restored the organization of the security corps. Initially, there were only more than six thousand regular police officers, which was insufficient. Therefore, a screening and adjustment was made, and a police training school was specially established to train basic cadres, using examinations to select cadres. As a result, significant progress was made in both quality and quantity. The security corps had served the country in the past and made outstanding contributions, and it was indeed necessary to rebuild it. Therefore, the Security Committee was established last November, with a Security Headquarters under it, divided into special affairs and standing brigades. The standing brigade members were recruited, and the city's jurisdiction was divided into eight districts, with a total of 1,309 corps members. There were 13,649 volunteer members. The security corps members lacked sufficient funding for uniforms and expenses. The municipal government was requested to increase the house tax to supplement the funding, and the Security Committee was to be merged into the Security Corps Headquarters. As for the handling of theft cases in the city, the current situation is more progressive than the pre-war concession era. According to statistics, in the public concession from 1939 to 1941, the average number of theft cases in January was 149, February was 123, November was 150, and December was 145. Since the municipal government took over, the number of theft cases has been 142 in November, 132 in December, 106 in January of this year, 96 in February, and 32 in the first half of March. 147 cases were solved, and a total of 427 bandits were captured.

Labor unrest: The living conditions of workers have a significant impact on social order. Since the recovery of the city, labor unrest has occurred continuously. The municipal government attaches great importance to the handling of this matter. Therefore, it was decided to raise wage standards. However, some workers are still engaging in work slowdowns. During strikes, there are often various excessive actions, such as beating factory managers and employees, and even surrounding the Social Affairs Bureau. If such behavior is not punished, it will not only fail to protect social peace but also affect production. Recently, four principles have been decided to handle labor disputes: (1) State-owned enterprises must comply with central regulations and must not engage in work slowdowns or strikes. (2) Work slowdowns and strikes that have not followed legal procedures should be banned. (3) Demands that are unacceptable given the current state of production in China should be rejected. (4) Illegal and excessive actions should be punished.

Garbage Removal: At the beginning of the municipal government's takeover, there were more than 10,000 tons of garbage in the city's streets. Under the supervision of the responsible authorities, 382,661 tons of garbage have been removed in the past six months.

Dredging Ditches: The city was damaged by the enemy and puppets for eight years, roads were damaged, and ditches were silted up. Especially in the western part of Shanghai, the terrain is low-lying, and during the rainy season, accumulated water cannot be discharged. Active efforts are now underway to dredge rivers and ditches.

Public Utilities: Before the city's recovery, the central government ordered that public utilities must not be allowed to shut down, so water and electricity were supplied as much as possible. Before the war, there were more than 23,000 street lights in the city, and 8,000 remained during the war. There are now 791 in the old city area and 9,125 in the entire city. In terms of transportation, before the war, there were 28 tram and trolley lines. Before the takeover, 12 lines were operating, and 7 have now been restored. Three public bus lines have now been opened, and the city ferry has restored two long-distance lines and two cross-river lines.

Land Administration Facilities: Although the city had land administration agencies before the war, the land survey and consolidation were not completed. During the occupation period, the land registry became even more chaotic. After the recovery, the municipal government is rectifying the land registry and clearing land taxes.

Eliminating Illiteracy: During the enemy puppet period, the entire education system was designed to enslave the people. Efforts are now being made to restore the original system. Municipal schools that were changed to private schools during the occupation period can be restored to municipal status and expanded. However, illiteracy still accounts for more than 50% of the city's population. Mass literacy schools are now being established.

Financial Difficulties: There are still many areas of dissatisfaction in the city's administration. The first reason is financial difficulty. Currently, the city's tax revenue only comes from entertainment, banquets, slaughter, licenses, and house taxes. At this point, the chairman announced a ten-minute break in the meeting, after which the mayor continued his report:

Implementation of Civil Affairs

Establishment of District Offices: District offices have been established throughout the city, divided into 31 districts. Recently, due to requests from the people of the former Zhenru District to restore the district, the number has been increased to 32. Except for Maqiao and Tangwan districts, where offices have not yet been established, the other 30 districts have been established one after another. In terms of funding, each district receives an establishment fee of 500,000 yuan from the municipal government as a one-time payment. The recurring expenses are 1,159,750 yuan per month for Category A districts and 853,180 yuan per month for Category B districts, which are issued by the municipal government on time.

Formation of Baojia: It has been decided that the Baojia organization will adopt a system of 30 households, with each Jia containing no fewer than ten households and each Bao containing no fewer than ten Jia. The reorganization of the Baojia was completed by the end of February. Statistics show that there are a total of 1,025 Bao and 23,850 Jia in the city. The operating expenses of the Bao offices are 81,615.01 yuan per month.

Household Census: The household census was completed on March 17. There are a total of 690,950 households and 3,345,875 people in the city. The department is stepping up efforts to issue national identity cards, conduct background checks on candidates for public office, prepare for the establishment of district people's representative conferences, and prepare for the election of municipal councilors.

Pan Xulun and others propose: Labor unrest must be eliminated first

After the report was completed, Councilor Pan Xulun raised a question, expressing strong support for the four principles decided by the mayor to handle labor unrest. However, he noted that the soaring prices in the city are closely related to the occurrence of labor unrest. Factories are unwilling to resume production, as evidenced by the reduced bidding at the Enemy Property Administration Bureau. This has made the unemployment problem increasingly serious. Factories in the interior are now taking Shanghai's place. The current foreign exchange regulations, which allow for massive imports of American goods, have a major impact on Shanghai's industrial development. Labor unrest must be resolved first. Councilor Wang Bing then stated that factories should pay attention to maintaining order and proposed issuing a declaration to attract social attention. Councilor Zhan Wen believes that production standards should be planned and that the municipal government should find ways to verify whether the production and living index matches the standard. Councilor Wang Genzhong made a speech, stating that the municipal government and its colleagues should not only speak from the perspective of the capitalists but should handle matters fairly and reasonably in accordance with the Three Principles of the People.

Xu Yongzuo questions the two points of relieving people's difficulties

At this time, Councilor Xu Yongzuo stood up and stated: The procedures stipulated by this council are for the mayor to report, and councilors should submit any discussions and suggestions at the next meeting. Councilor Xu then asked two questions: (1) Reports indicate that the municipal government plans to build a council hall on Linsen Road. He believes that the people are now suffering greatly, and this expenditure should not be made. He requested that these funds be used to solve the people's difficulties. (2) The Municipal Public Works Bureau plans to demolish houses on Zhejiang Road to widen the road, but there is currently an urgent housing shortage, and citizens are displaced. He hoped that the demolition could be postponed for one or two years.

The mayor immediately stood up and replied that the suggestion to build a meeting place was only a suggestion and had not yet been finalized, and the funds had not been raised. As for the demolition of houses on Zhejiang Road, the Municipal Public Works Bureau would respond later. At 11:30, the councilors took a photo in the front courtyard of the building and adjourned the meeting.

At 5:00 PM, Mayor Qian held a tea party in the auditorium of the Municipal Government to entertain the councilors. More than a hundred people, including councilors, military and political leaders, bureau chiefs, chief editors of newspapers, and reporters, attended. The atmosphere was harmonious and lively, and the party ended at 7:00 PM.

Councilors discuss various proposals

[Report from this Newspaper] Municipal Provisional Councilors Zhou Xuexiang, Shui Xiangxue, Fan Cai, Shen Ding, and Zhao Banfu are very concerned about labor issues. Recently, they received suggestions from various labor unions and intend to submit proposals to the council on their behalf. Yesterday afternoon at 9:00 PM, they met to discuss the content and detailed reasons for the proposals. The main items include: (1) Requesting the government to increase the number of labor union representatives in the National Assembly. (2) Actively implementing worker welfare, including education for workers' children, establishing worker nurseries, etc. (3) Reasonably handling labor disputes. (4) Resolving the livelihood issues of unemployed workers. (5) Stipulating a minimum wage for workers. (6) Requesting that the wage and living index be calculated twice a month, etc.

Councilors Xi Yushu and Wang Bing and others intend to propose: (1) The Enemy Property Administration Bureau's docks and warehouses were previously entrusted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to the Jianghai Customs for sealing and management. It is now requested that the government order the Jianghai Customs to transfer these docks and warehouses to the municipal government for takeover. (2) Advocate that the stock exchange be reopened immediately and collect exchange taxes separately.

In addition to requesting the government to allocate 30% of the funds to expand education in the city and subsidize private schools, Councilor Zhou Feicheng and others also requested that the government order the return of school buildings occupied by various military agencies, etc.

Municipal Councilors Host Leaders of District Chiefs

Councilors Wang Genzhong, Shen Chunhui, Lu Entan, Cao Shi, and Zhou Feicheng and others are scheduled to hold a tea party at Councilor Wang's residence at 285 Zhao Zhujiao Road at 2:00 PM today to entertain the district chiefs and all Bao chiefs of Taishan, Changshu, Huajiawan, and Xujiahui districts, listen to their statements, and forward them to the Provisional Council for reference. It is reported that the remaining councilors will also continue to hold group meetings. 70,000 citizens of Zhabei have submitted twelve suggestions to the Municipal Provisional Council for relief and revitalization of Zhabei.

### Famous French Real Estate Businessman Accused of Endangering the Republic of China: Wrote Articles to Advocate for the Enemy and Puppet Regimes, Debate Concluded, Sentencing Scheduled

[Report from this Newspaper] The High Court's Criminal Division, being Sunday today, has no court session as usual. The first two days of the month are also holidays, so yesterday, at the end of this month, the court session was longer. The debate in the case of the French brothers Xavier Arthur and Xavier Dejautel was also opened yesterday. The Xavier brothers grew up in China and are well-known real estate businessmen in Shanghai. Arthur, 49, wore brown clothes; Dejautel, 47, wore black, both were full of energy and physically strong. During the occupation period of Shanghai, the two brothers occasionally wrote articles published in the English-language *North China Daily News*, in which some of the content praised and promoted the enemy and puppet regimes and the puppet Central Reserve Bank of China notes they issued. Because they used their writing to promote the enemy, which was detrimental to our country during the war, the prosecutor charged them with endangering the Republic of China. However, Arthur argued that the brothers' writings were purely based on academic exploration. Because they grew up in Shanghai, they were very interested in Chinese finance. As businessmen, their judgments inevitably came from the interests of businessmen. Therefore, the so-called praise of the enemy and puppet financial policies was not their intention. Their lawyer, Jiang Pingfan, also argued on their behalf that the Xavier brothers' opinions in the newspaper were published earlier than 1935, not after the Japanese occupied Shanghai. Of the 340 articles written in the past eight or nine years, most were about the actual economic problems in Shanghai and were not related to politics or military affairs. Most of them were beneficial to China and not to the enemy and puppet regimes. Therefore, by 1943, the *North China Daily News*, which was controlled by the enemy and puppet regimes, refused to publish their articles. This proves that they had no intention of committing crimes. After the debate, sentencing was scheduled for the 5th of next month.

### Impersonated a Reporter to Extort Money from Factory Owner: Reduced from Ten Million to Five Million Yuan, Arrested While Receiving Payment in a Cafe

[Report from this Newspaper] At about 4:00 PM on the 25th, a well-dressed young man in a suit suddenly visited Ying Jipin, the owner of the New China Iron Factory at 336 Xiaoshadu Road. He presented a business card with the name Wang Kezhe, a special correspondent for the Shanghai Frontline Daily. Ying had never met him before and refused to meet him. On the afternoon of the 26th, the young man went again but was not met. Before leaving, he threatened that there would be regrets. On the 27th, Ying was summoned by his friend Feng Yuming (manager of Xin Chang Shipyard on South Chengdu Road) as a representative and wired him to have lunch at the C.P.C. cafe on Avenue Joffre at noon. As it turned out, Feng did not go. That evening, Wang called Ying Jipin, saying that the representative Feng had not arrived, showing no sincerity. He then re-appointed him on the phone and agreed to meet at the Shanghai Western Restaurant on Guangdong Road at 9:00 PM that evening. Feng Yuming would still be the sole representative. At that time, Feng and his friend Wang Wengao, who was also serving in a certain military agency, told him that if he was willing to pay a certain amount of money, they could help him make amends and not be prosecuted. At that time, Feng and Wang tried their best to persuade him to help. Later, the young man said that Ying had to pay 10 million yuan in French currency. Feng and Wang said that the asking price was too high and they could not agree to it at once. It was changed to talking at the Royal Cafe at the intersection of Nanjing West Road and Taixing Road at 2:00 PM the next afternoon. The two sides met as scheduled. As a result of the negotiations, it was changed to 5 million yuan, and it was agreed to pay the money at the cafe at 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM on the 29th. On the morning of the 29th, Ying told his friend Cui Mingsheng about the incident. Cui said that he was familiar with the former *Qian Daily* and would inquire and inform him later. At about 12:00, Ying received a call from Cui saying that there was no reporter surnamed Wang in the newspaper. Then Ying knew that he was impersonating him and reported the information to the Xin Cheng Police Bureau. The police were ordered to go in disguise and pose as customers in the cafe. When Feng Wang and others arrived at the museum, the young man was already there. After pretending to be friendly, he took out a bag of French currency. After he put it in his pocket, the plainclothes police officers arrested him and took him to the branch. According to the confession, he lives at No. 1, Jishanfang, Yin Gui Road, North Sichuan. The police were dispatched to the above-mentioned guard address and seized a handgun and fourteen rifle bullets. It is heard that there are still seven accomplices at large. The branch is still investigating the case.

### Pasture Employees Provide Evidence: Shen Wanling Collaborated with the Enemy: Defendant Still Denies Joint Management with Japanese: Seven Traitors Convicted Yesterday

[Report from this Newspaper] The Criminal Division of the High Court in Tilanqiao opened a collegiate court yesterday afternoon. Because there was a debate in the case of Shen Wanling, the owner of Shengsheng Ranch, the audience was filled with employees of Shengsheng Ranch, totaling more than 80 people, as well as Shen's relatives and friends. Shen's sister, Shen Jiaoyuan, and his wife, Tao Naixiang, and others came by car.

Representatives of all dairy farm employees attend the hearing

Employees from the Kedi Milk Factory, Shanghai Milk Factory, and Xin Sheng Milk Factory also sent representatives to participate in the hearing. Employees of Shengsheng Ranch even printed and distributed written appeals, calling on everyone to punish the traitor. Shen's case was publicly tried on February 19 and March 23. During the trial on the 23rd, Zhang Daode, Huang Jiajin and other employees of Shengsheng Ranch presented various evidence that Shen had collaborated with the enemy in business during the Japanese occupation of Shanghai and used milk to support the enemy. Therefore, Shen was brought to court yesterday. Presiding Judge Liu Yugui immediately questioned Shen about the evidence presented by the employees of Shengsheng Ranch and asked if he had anything to say. In addition to denying that he had cooperated with the Japanese in management, Shen Wanling also argued that the ranch had donated milk to the National Army at the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, and that he himself had participated in the patriotic activities of the Three Principles of the People Youth League. He insisted that the accusations made against him by the employees of Shengsheng Ranch were obviously due to someone coveting his ranch, so they bought and instigated the ranch employees to report him on charges of treason in order to fulfill their private desires. Shen originally hired three lawyers. Yesterday, lawyer Wang Shanxiang appeared in court to defend him. Wang stated that Shen was purely a businessman, and during the enemy and puppet occupation, his dealings with the enemy were to cope with the environment and were purely from a profit-making perspective. In the end, the court ordered the debate to be concluded and the sentencing was scheduled for the 5th of next month.

The Director of the Puppet Issuing Bureau was sentenced to ten years in prison

In addition, the High Court rendered verdicts in seven cases yesterday: (1) Mao Renyu: Deputy Director of the Issuing Bureau of the Puppet Central Reserve Bank and Director of the Issuing Section of the Shanghai Branch, sentenced to ten years imprisonment and ten years deprivation of civil rights.

### Soldiers Plot Rebellion: Recruit Vagrants and Dispersed Soldiers

### The China Branch of UNRRA Supervises Fan Haibi's Talk: On the Distribution of Relief Supplies to Us, Taking the Restoration of Transportation, Industry, Mining, Fisheries, and Agriculture as a Prerequisite, the Originally Planned Amount is Valued at US$256 Million

[Report from this Newspaper] Mr. Fan Haibi, Supervisor of the General Accounting Office of the China Branch of UNRRA, arrived in Shanghai on the "Qunxing" passenger plane. Yesterday, a reporter paid a special visit to inquire about the distribution of UNRRA relief supplies to our country. He was informed that the UNRRA's relief strategy is that while providing food to disaster areas is important, the fundamental solution lies in striving to restore various facilities such as transportation, industry, mining, fisheries, and agriculture in the affected countries, so that they can be self-reliant. The UNRRA's relief work can also have constructive results.

Therefore, food relief is of secondary importance. Furthermore, reports on the quantity of relief supplies allocated to us by UNRRA may vary slightly from place to place. According to the figures brought by the Communist Party from UNRRA, the distribution of UNRRA relief supplies to our country last year, according to the originally planned amount, was valued at US$256 million. This includes: (1) Transportation and telecommunications equipment, US$120 million; (2) Public utility equipment, US$20 million; (3) Construction and industrial equipment, US$5.7 million; (4) Minerals and coal, US$8 million; (5) Machinery repair equipment, US$7.2 million; (6) Fuel and machine oil, US$9 million; (7) Miscellaneous consumer goods (including rice and grain), US$22 million; (8) Chemical materials, etc., US$64 million. The actual distribution amount: (1) accounted for 122%; (5) accounted for 230%; (6) accounted for 154%, all exceeding the originally planned allocation by a large margin. There were also two items that were insufficient, namely (2) accounting for 79% and (4) accounting for 67%. The distribution percentages of other items (3, 7, and 8) have not yet been calculated.

The originally planned allocation for the first half of this year is valued at US$136.7 million. This includes: (1) US$95.3 million; (2) US$9.5 million; (5) US$11.4 million; (4) US$1.5 million; (5) US$1 million; (6) US$6 million; (7) US$5 million; (8) US$11 million. In addition, there is a new item for improving industrial facilities, totaling US$500,000. The total weight of relief supplies in the first half of this year was 692,000 tons. It was also reported that the actual distribution of UNRRA relief supplies to the world (excluding China) last year was very low as a percentage of the originally planned amount. For example, transportation and telecommunications equipment accounted for only 33%, industrial rehabilitation equipment accounted for only 35%, agricultural rehabilitation equipment accounted for only 22%, and food accounted for only 11%.

Pan American Airlines' Flight Plan

Mr. Fan also mentioned the future flight plans of Pan American Airlines. He said that while in the United States, he was informed by the company's staff that they planned to establish a central Pacific air route between the United States and the Far East. Once they have obtained a sufficient number of "Qunxing" passenger planes, they can open regular flights. Before the Pacific War, the company used Clipper flying boats to fly to the Far East. However, those aircraft were too slow and are no longer suitable. The company will have three routes related to the Far East. In addition to the original route via Manila, the central route will start from San Francisco, via Honolulu, Wake Island, Tokyo, and reach Shanghai. The northern route is the shortest, passing through Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. The "Qunxing" passenger plane has a speed of 300 miles per hour, weighs 52,000 pounds, and has a maximum passenger capacity of 54 people. Mr. Fan has lived in China for many years. Before the war, he was the editor of the "China Magazine." From 1938 to 1942, he worked in the International Propaganda Department of the Ministry of Information and is fluent in Mandarin.

### Explaining to the Japanese the Cause and Effect of Japan's Defeat

The Mission of the Cultural Work Committee for Japan

[Report from this Newspaper] The Shanghai Branch of the Cultural Work Committee for Japan of the Ministry of Information held a reception for the press yesterday afternoon. Committee members Luo Kedian and Zou Renzhi successively reported on the organization process of the committee and the general re-education work for Japanese prisoners of war and expatriates. It was stated that most of the prisoners of war remaining in China currently do not understand the cause and effect of this defeat and still harbor hatred. Therefore, in addition to explaining the purpose of our country's resistance and future national policies in writing, the committee also holds weekly symposiums or gatherings for music, literature, art, and drama to promote their understanding of our country. Subsequently, Secretary-General Tsubaki Shu of the Japan National Revolutionary Comrades Association was introduced. The Comrades Association was established on September 14, 1944, and assisted the United Nations in the war against Japan during the War of Resistance. It currently has more than 600 members and will soon return to the country to engage in the construction of a new democratic Japan.

### Electricity Consumption Increases Sharply After the Abolition of the Tiered System

Power Company Seeks to Increase Production

[Report from this Newspaper] Since the abolition of the tiered electricity system, the amount of electricity used in this city has increased sharply. American-owned Shanghai Power Company is now working hard to find ways to increase production. According to the person in charge of the company, it will soon be increased to a maximum of 123,000 kilowatts. Most of the electricity in this city is supplied by Shanghai Power Company, except for a small portion supplied by the French-owned Water and Electricity Company. Its electricity consumption is 118,000 kilowatts.

Power Company Overwhelmed

The Municipal Public Works Bureau recently convened various electric companies, including American, French, Chinese, Zhabei, and Pudong, to discuss the allocation of electricity supply in the city to reduce the power generation burden of Shanghai Power Company. This is because the company suffered heavy losses during the war, and it will not be able to fully recover within a year. The current power generation capacity is only one-third of its peak period. Before the war, Zhabei Water and Electricity Company could generate 38,000 kilowatts, Chinese Electric Company had 16,000 kilowatts, and Pudong Electric Company also had 500 kilowatts, but they were all destroyed in the war. Therefore, the power generation burden of Shanghai Power Company is even heavier.

### Various Parties Intend to Push Up Prices: Bond Prices Rebound and Rise Again. Chinese Stocks Mostly Remain Stationary. Foreign Stocks in the Paper Industry See the Strongest Uptick

Although there is no official trading of public bonds, the quoted prices are trending upwards due to attempts by some stronger entities to push them up. Although the Overseas Chinese Building is no longer suitable for use, some businesses are moving back to their original locations. Class C bonds were initially quoted at 3,300 yuan for sale, but with no buyers, they were sold at a lower price. Only when the price dropped to around 3,050 yuan were there buyers. Many parties, seeing that the low price would be detrimental to the settlement of accounts, then took the opportunity to push the price up again, rising to over 3,450 yuan before leveling off slightly. There were very few transactions in the middle. As a result, the price of miscellaneous brands fell slightly compared to before the close, while Class C bonds rose slightly. Major players in the Chinese stock market were unanimously taking a break, with only very scattered transfers. Quoted prices varied by the popularity of each stock, with small declines by grade. Foreign stocks initially saw both rises and falls, but sentiment was stable due to the official announcement of the amendment to the Company Law, which is beneficial to foreign businesses. The general mentality was to choose cheaper stocks, leading to a sudden increase in the number of buyers for paper stocks, which have always been on par with Jardine Brewery. The stock price jumped by nearly 20%. Other small stocks received some support and were also slightly lifted. Steel stocks, which had been very active in recent days, were slightly paused yesterday, with prices falling back to level. Other rises and falls were minor. Near noon, a certain company that operated Western-style stores, known for stomach-strengthening products, had almost exhausted the purchase of popular stocks, and then closed at a high price. As a result, compared to before the close, only paper stocks rose by over 20%, Jardine Brewery and Asiatic Petroleum by about 10%, Jardine Spinning by half a percent, and British American Tobacco, Wheelock, and Jardine Matheson were flat. Steel stocks, on the other hand, fell back by a little over half a percent.

### Revised Exchange Method for US Dollar Bonds and Savings Certificates

The method for exchanging US Dollar Bonds and matured interest, as well as US Dollar Savings Certificates, issued by the government in 1942, will be revised according to Article 8 of the Foreign Exchange Management Regulations: (1) Holders of the above-mentioned bonds can sell the bonds and their coupons to the Central Bank and other designated banks to exchange for national currency or use them as legal foreign exchange payments. (2) The Central Bank and other designated banks that accept the exchange of bonds and coupons should include them in the US Dollar account. (3) The exchange of bonds and interest is limited to domestic transactions and cannot be negotiated for direct payment of US Dollars in the United States. The Central Bank has notified American banks to implement the regulations accordingly. At the same time, the payment of principal and interest on US Dollar Savings Certificates must still comply with the restrictions of the US law freezing foreign funds. Furthermore, according to the addendum to Article 20 of the Supplementary Regulations for the Management of Foreign Exchange, holders can sell the bonds and their coupons to the issuing banks, or after verification by the banks, sell them to the Central Bank, or use them directly as foreign exchange as stipulated. Bonds held by enemy and puppet forces will not be exchanged.

### US Gold Reserves Surge

[United Press, Washington, 29th] According to the Federal Reserve, gold reserves increased by $24,000,000 this Wednesday, reaching the highest peak since June 27th of last year, totaling $20,257,000,000.

### Decided on Handling Lost Gold Certificates

The handling method for lost gold certificates has been approved by the Four Banks Joint Office as follows: (1) After a gold certificate (including gold deposit certificates, legal tender converted gold deposit certificates, and futures receipts) is reported lost in accordance with banking practice, it will be handled in accordance with the provisions of this method. (2) For certificates with a retained seal, after the loss report has expired, the applicant for the loss report should fill out an application form for reissuing the certificate, invite a reputable guarantor to provide a guarantee letter, and after review, a new certificate will be reissued. (3) If the original depository bank deems that the above-mentioned lost certificate is questionable, it may order the applicant for the loss report to apply to the competent court for legal determination before handling it. (4) Before a new certificate is reissued for a certificate reported lost, if the original depository bank discovers the original certificate, it should temporarily suspend the exchange and notify the person who reported the loss to negotiate with the certificate holder as soon as possible. After negotiation and settlement or a court ruling, it can be handled according to the method agreed by both parties or the final court judgment. (5) If a new certificate has been reissued for a certificate reported lost, if the original certificate is discovered by the original depository bank before it has been exchanged, the holder of the original certificate should apply to the local court to allow the new certificate to be provisionally disposed of and notify the original depository bank to stop the exchange; otherwise, the original depository bank will still exchange it based on the new certificate. (6) Regardless of whether a new certificate has been reissued for a certificate reported lost, if the original certificate is discovered, the original depository bank may, depending on the circumstances, detain it and issue a detention receipt, or simply stamp the words "This certificate has been reported lost, please negotiate with the applicant for the loss report" on the original certificate to prevent continued circulation.

### Yarn and Cotton Both Rise; Guangdong Merchants Trade the Most

The yarn market saw a turnaround yesterday, with strong purchasing interest from Guangdong merchants. 20-count Shuangma yarn traded up to 1.234 million, closing 100,000 higher than before the Youth Day holiday. Other high-end goods such as Dafa Jincheng and other heavy-weight yarns also jumped by 70,000 to 80,000. Ordinary 20-count yarn followed suit, rising by 20,000 to 30,000. Most of the trading was by buyers from Guangdong and Guangxi, followed by inland merchants. Weavers and sock manufacturers remained inactive, so the increase in fine yarn and double-thread yarn was limited.

Yesterday, the New York American cotton telegraph soared by 62 to 66 points, with nearby futures at US$27.79 and distant futures at US$27.67. There is still no market for Middling spot cotton. The local cotton market is optimistic, as holders of spot cotton, seeing the rising prices of foreign cotton and the strong yarn prices, are holding on tightly to their goods, making negotiations difficult to approach. Therefore, there were no transactions for spinning and weaving companies and private yarn factories. Only some traders did a little business, with prices up by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan compared to before the holiday.

### Silk Trading Becomes Active

Yesterday, 120-count artificial silk "Inubashi" opened at 1.65 million yuan, with quite a bit of trading. The price rose to 1.7 million yuan at the close, up 90,000 yuan from Thursday. No trading was done for raw silk of foreign firms. Raw silk "Shuangma" (five piculs), headed at a transaction price of 1.85 million yuan and then repriced to 1.75 million yuan.

The delivery date for the traded goods for those prices is on Monday at 3,850 per yard.

### Woolen Fabrics Remain Stiff

The woolen fabric market remains similar to before. The prices of various goods have not changed much. Light-colored spring thin flannels and summer goods of various colors remain stiff. Dark-colored thick woolen fabrics for autumn and winter sales are less active because new goods are expected to arrive in the future, so buyers are less interested. Recently, the woolen fabric and clothing industry in Nanjing has been quite developed. Many powerful members of the industry have successively developed in the capital city and opened branch stores.

### Rice Prices Continue to Fall; Oil Market's Sources are Quite Active

The rice market is experiencing clear weather, abundant sources, and sluggish digestion. The prices of Geng and Xian rice are gradually declining by about a little over a thousand yuan. Yinbai rice continued to fall by two thousand yuan, with few buyers. Yongbang flour is slightly inquired, but the market is very weak. The market shape is still shrinking, and prices are slightly down by 200 yuan, with a dull trend. Bran is stable. The oil market has various sources of supply, with the most abundant arrivals from Qingdao. Sales are flat, and prices are falling day by day, down another two thousand yuan. Soybean trading is sparse, but corn is rare and strong. Raw peanuts are also somewhat flat and weak. Soybean cake fell back by a hundred yuan. All grains are temporarily in a downward trend.

Furthermore, according to the rice market news, there were more than 8,000 piculs of rice arriving in this city yesterday. The types and quantities are as follows: Bai Geng 4,084 piculs, Du Xian 937 piculs, Bao Dao 912 piculs, Bai Yuan 20 piculs, Zao Dao 2,142 piculs, Yin Yuan 183 piculs, Yang Jian 445 piculs.

### Shui Dongzhi Makes Its First Appearance of the New Season

Since the new Shui Dongzhi came out, transportation has been inconvenient, and there has been a long lack of shipments. It is now learned that the shipping company has transferred a batch of more than 50 boxes from Hong Kong. Due to the port transfer, a tax on imported goods had to be added, resulting in higher costs and no guaranteed profits. It has now been opened for sale at a price of 85,500 yuan. After the brokers purchase it, they must be sorted and picked, and the sale is expected to be at prices of 100,000 or higher.

### Real Estate Registration for Assigned Prices Vanishes Gold Market Deteriorates Daily U.S. Dollars and Hong Kong Bills Both Fall

The gold market is gradually softening in a calm state. Holders are selling off one after another. The general trend is hopeless. The Bank of China's assigned price is still 1.6 million, but registrants have disappeared for many days. At the opening this morning, it was around 1.56 million, but after the opening, it was consistently overwhelmed by sellers. Support was lacking. Although the volume of transactions was limited, people's hearts were disheartened. Gold long-term loans have approached the bottom price. At the end of the month, some do not intend to renew and are settling. In the afternoon, it once fell below the 1.5 million mark, and then slightly stabilized. As a result, it fell another 25,000 compared to the previous day. Ornamental gold was 166,000. Sycee silver remained unchanged. Silver dollars were also stable. The black market interest rate loosened and then tightened slightly, from 1.6 to 2 jiao after interest.

Foreign currencies, U.S. dollars, were also stimulated by the gold market and continued to trend downwards. At the opening this morning, it was around 1,970 yuan. This price was supported for a while. 50-yuan bills and large bills were more than 50 yuan lower than the market price. Demand was lacking. In the afternoon, it almost approached the 1,900 yuan mark, and then slightly stabilized, down 50 yuan compared to the closing price before the break. Old Hong Kong bills were flat. New bills wanted to float up but stopped again. As a result, they finally fell by 5 to 10 yuan. Hong Kong Telecom rose slightly to 440 yuan, and Robbie was 540 yuan.

### White Coal Continues to Decline Firewood Prices Fall Simultaneously

The coal market for all types of white coal is sluggish and transactions are scarce. Yangquan screened lumps are quoted at 600,000 yuan, but there are no buyers. The trend of bituminous coal is relatively stable. Although the weather is clear, many of the firewood and charcoal arrivals are still damp, and sales remain sluggish. Yesterday, several boats of dry anti-white firewood from Meixi arrived in Shanghai. Large pieces, about 11 or 12 jin each, were priced at 750 yuan. Medium pieces, slightly less than 4 jin, were priced at 350 yuan, equivalent to about 7,000 or 8,000 yuan per dan. Transactions were quite lively.

### Sino-British Exchange Rate Not Determined by Us British Industry and Commerce in Recovery Phase No Major Transactions with Britain

British officials claim that Anglo-Chinese trade is hampered by the undetermined exchange rate between China and Britain. According to financial authorities in Shanghai, there are actually very few major transactions in China's trade with Britain at present, and British domestic industry and commerce are also transitioning from wartime to peacetime. The amount of materials and equipment that can be supplied to China is extremely small. At the same time, the British authorities have set the U.S. dollar exchange rate within their sterling area at US$4.03 for every pound. Due to limited demand in the Shanghai market, the market price of the pound is constantly maintained between 3.6 yuan (the number of U.S. dollars converted from the pound). As for how to determine the exchange rate in order to promote the prosperity of trade between the two sides, it is hoped that the British authorities can have an enlightened way to set the exchange rate. However, it is said that the reason why our official exchange rate with Britain has not been determined is due to the above reasons, and there are no other opinions.

### Glass Yarn Belongs to Luxury Goods Currently Difficult to Import

Glass yarn can be used as a substitute for rayon, and it was reported in this newspaper that foreign firms can order it. It is now learned that the Jianghai Customs recently announced that "According to the National Government's Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade, the Jianghai Customs Import Management Office has listed nineteen kinds of luxury goods (including pure silk or mixed silk knitted satin, etc.). Except for those who apply to the Jianghai Customs Certification Office within ten days after the promulgation of these measures and can arrive before the 30th of this month, all are prohibited from being imported." Therefore, goods in transit, if they cannot arrive before the deadline, will definitely not be able to land. According to precedent, glass yarn cannot be imported either. Therefore, foreign firms are currently unable to accept orders.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Timber: Yesterday the timber trend was stable. The market was slightly better than before, because the weather was clear and the lumber yards moved slightly, so the sluggishness has slightly improved.

Tea: Dealers are selling old stocks of various grades, and the market is oversupplied, with prices trending lower and lower.

Sugar: The weather cleared up, customer sales gradually moved, and transactions were lively. Medium granulated sugar opened at 49,000 yuan in the morning and rose to 49,500 yuan, closing back at 49,250 yuan. Cotton white sugar was also boosted. Due to the large quantities of Qing sugar arriving in Xiamen and Shantou, it is temporarily difficult to expect it to improve. Dutch sugar is also in short supply, rising by 2,000 yuan.

Cigarettes: British-American cigarettes and Chinese factory cigarettes, Hangzhou and Ningbo procurement is quite strong, and with speculators participating in the activities, they are all thriving.

### Ministry of Justice and Administration Orders All Provinces and Cities to Vigorously Report Traitors in Education

[Dahua News Agency Chongqing Dispatch] In order to vigorously report traitors in education, the Ministry of Justice and Administration has ordered all provinces and cities to comply, stating: Article 2, paragraph 1, item 5 of the Regulations on Handling Traitor Cases stipulates that those who have served as presidents or held important positions in specialist schools or above affiliated with the puppet organization are traitors and should be vigorously reported. Therefore, there is no doubt about the punishment of puppet university presidents, independent college presidents, specialist school presidents, and those who hold important positions in these schools, such as deans, guidance counselors, and bursars, and deans of various colleges. According to item 8 of the same paragraph of the same article, heads of puppet cultural institutions who have presided over cultural organizations within the jurisdiction of the puppet organization and propagandized for the enemy and puppets are also traitors and should be punished. As for middle school principals, as heads of educational institutions, their importance is greater than that of civil officials, and according to the provisions of item 1 of the same paragraph of the same article, they should also be severely punished. Moreover, according to Article 3 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors, "Those who have served in puppet organizations or their affiliated agencies and organizations, relying on the power of the enemy and puppets, and engaging in actions that benefit the enemy and puppets or are detrimental to the country, shall be deemed to be plotting to resist the country." Middle school principals affiliated with puppet organizations should be important personnel serving in academic institutions affiliated with puppet organizations. In terms of their mission and behavior, it is sufficient to constitute a serious suspicion of relying on the labor of the enemy and puppets to engage in acts that benefit the enemy and puppets or are detrimental to the country. Local judicial organs should vigorously report and try them according to law.

(3) Troops stationed in schools and educational institutions are requested to be ordered by the Xingying to move out immediately, and it is reported that they are being implemented step by step.

### U.S. Columbia University Establishes School Custodian Crash Course

The Teachers College of Columbia University in New York, USA, has a crash course for school custodians, which is specially designed to improve the management skills of school custodians (commonly known as doormen). The professor of the course is the superintendent of the Teachers College. Twenty-four years ago, when he was a teacher in a rural elementary school in Iowa, USA, he also served as a custodian.

### Departing from the Mountainous Regions: Walking the Xilan Road in Snow

— Special Correspondent Bingzi, Xi'an Air Dispatch from this Newspaper, 19th

The Xilan Highway, a vital artery of transportation in the Northwest, has made significant contributions to the nation and its people during the eight-plus years of the protracted war of resistance. Before the completion of the railways, it remains the only reliable means for developing and constructing the Northwest. I recently made a trip along the Xilan Road, and recorded my observations in a diary. While many entries are trivial, some are worth reporting.

Boarding a Sedan, Leaving Lanzhou

Although many travelers now opt for the Baotian Railway to travel from Lanzhou to Xi'an, some still prefer the Xilan Road. The train on the Baotian Railway is more economical, but traveling by car is faster and more direct. On the 9th, amidst falling snow, I departed from Lanzhou in a sedan, which was the second vehicle leaving Lanzhou for Shaanxi that week. Those who couldn't get sedan tickets traveled in trucks. Many of my fellow passengers were returning home or demobilized soldiers, some heading to Beijing and Shanghai, others to Beijing and Tianjin. Since the victory, there has been a massive exodus of demobilized personnel and people returning home from the northwestern provinces, especially Gansu and Xinjiang. The Northwest, which has always suffered from a lack of people and talent, now places no restrictions on those leaving. The responsible authorities should pay close attention to this.

Arriving at Gancaodian, Snow Unmelted

The car arrived at Gancaodian around 10 AM. After breakfast, we continued our journey. The weather remained gloomy. On both sides of the highway, many farmers were already working in the fields. The heavy snow of a few days prior was greatly beneficial for sowing (spring wheat). Gansu suffered from severe drought last year, but a good harvest is expected this year. The car gradually climbed uphill past Dingxi. The accumulated snow remained unmelted along the way, turning the land white. Around 5 PM, we finally arrived at Huajialing, a dreaded stop for long-distance travelers. The entire journey covered 189 kilometers.

Huajialing is 2,700 meters above sea level, and travelers fear the unbearable cold. In the past, bandits were rampant near Huajialing, but now the presence of stationed troops has brought relative peace. The high mountains and steep ridges in this area are sparsely populated. The arduousness of the road construction work is beyond the imagination of those who travel by car. A stone monument stands outside the station to commemorate the heroic deeds of the engineers and laborers who died during construction.

Leaving Jiayuguan, Tears Still Wet

The prerequisite for developing the Northwest is to develop transportation. Highways alone are not enough; railway construction is imperative. We hope that all parties will show the same determination and spirit as when the highways were built, and construct the railways ahead of schedule. I remember that Wu Zhihui, before he passed away, told me after wandering through Hexi, "In the past, people said, 'Once you leave Jiayuguan, your eyes never dry from tears.' This is entirely due to the underdeveloped transportation. Outside Jiayuguan there is fertile land. If the railway is opened, people inside the pass will naturally move outside the pass. Even people from Jiangsu and Zhejiang will be willing to reclaim land outside the pass." Mr. Wu believed that without railways, everything would be in vain.

Snowing in June is Not a Myth

We stayed at the China Travel Service hostel in Huajialing. After getting up at 6 AM on the 10th, I found that the towel I used to wash my face last night had frozen into a block of ice. The stove in the room seemed useless. The cold was far more intense than when I passed through here from Chongqing around this time last year. Large snowflakes fell from the sky. Despite the driver's adage that "snow is easier to travel through than melting snow," he drove the car out. Ancient people said that "snowing in June is a rare sight," but here it is quite common. People from Jiangnan may consider it a myth.

Venturing Forward in Snow, Desolate and Uninhabited

We ventured forward in the biting cold and snow. Although it was downhill, we did not dare to rush. The journey was desolate and uninhabited. We occasionally passed a village or two, where we saw impoverished people dressed in rags. Gansu does not produce cotton. The clothing for the province's nearly seven million people mostly relies on external supplies. The provincial government has promoted local handicrafts, using wool to replace cotton to supplement the lack of clothing, but with limited success.

Around 1 PM, we arrived at Jingning County. This place is famous for its unique Northwestern "Guokui" (a kind of baked wheaten cake). The flour used to make "Guokui" is not only fine and white, but the water quality is also excellent. Those who are used to eating it say it tastes delicious. "Guokui" costs 80 yuan per kilogram, which is almost twice as cheap as in Lanzhou. Many travelers buy this local product as a gift for friends and relatives.

The Mist of Liupan Mountain Grows Thicker

After the snow stopped, we decided to abandon our plan to stay overnight in Jingning. As we left Jingning, we saw a vast plain. The left Gong Liu trees along the road stood tall. Gansu's policy of afforestation and forest protection over the years has achieved considerable results. After traveling more than twenty kilometers, we climbed the Liupan Mountain, which is even more treacherous than Huajialing. The silver world reappeared before our eyes, and the mist obscuring the road grew thicker as we ascended, like a morning in Chongqing. Liupan Mountain is said to be where Genghis Khan stationed his troops, but I have not yet verified this.

At the foot of the mountain, we saw sprouting wheat fields and newly green willows, and the climate was noticeably different. At dusk, we arrived at Sanguankou. At the corner of the mountain is Liulangchao, an important place where Yang Liulang led troops to defend in the past. Residents near Sanguankou still tell stories of Yang Liulang's heroism. We reached Pingliang County when the city lights had already come on.

Pingliang is the only major town in eastern Gansu, with a population of ten thousand. Merchants from Gansu, Shaanxi, and Ningxia provinces gather here, and commerce is quite developed. Eastern Gansu is close to northern Shaanxi. In the past, due to the presence of the "Border Region," Pingliang was often on alert. Now that the full-scale military conflict has ceased, perhaps Pingliang can finally be at peace.

The Xilan Road is 719 kilometers long, and the entire journey is scheduled to take four days, with Pingliang as the central point. The 415-kilometer section of the Pingliang section is mostly mountainous, often giving travelers the feeling that "traveling is difficult." The 304-kilometer section of the Pingxi section has relatively flat roads, making the two-day journey feel quite pleasant.

Arriving at Jingchuan County, Greenery Everywhere

Leaving Pingliang on the morning of the 11th, we traveled 65 kilometers and arrived at Jingchuan for lunch. Jingchuan is the easternmost county in Gansu, and also a prosperous area. With the arrival of spring, the fields in Jingchuan are flourishing, and the land is green, reminiscent of the Jiangnan region. Not far from Jingchuan, we entered Shaanxi Province. We continued forward, passing through Changwu and arriving at Bin County in the afternoon.

I spent a night in Bin County, deeply impressed by the simplicity of the people. Because of timely rainfall, grain prices were particularly cheap. On the morning of the 12th, we departed from Bin County, passing through Yongshou, Qian County, Liquan, Xianyang, and other counties, and arrived at Xi'an. Near Qian County is the tomb of Wu Zetian, and Xianyang is the old base of the Qin Shi Huang. There are also many relics from the Han and Tang dynasties. Shaanxi has many historical sites and scenic spots that are worth admiring, but I have not yet had the opportunity to visit them. (March 19th)

### The Scene on the Eve of Restoring Civil Administration: Hong Kong's Reality and Dreams

— Special Correspondent Lin Youlan in Hong Kong, Air Dispatch from this Newspaper, 23rd

Today, six months after Rear Admiral Harcourt (now promoted to Vice Admiral) led the British fleet back into Hong Kong, restoring civil administration has become a major concern for everyone. The restoration work in Hong Kong can be said to be on track, but when comparing the general social situation now and then, there is a sense of difference. This difference lies in the distinction between military administration and civil administration.

When Will Civil Administration Be Restored?

The people of Hong Kong seem to have the feeling that the existence of military administration is an obstacle to restoring the old order. Why hasn't military administration been abolished by now? In any case, military administration is a measure for extraordinary times. It does not seek adherence to established rules, but is skilled in expediency. The biggest thing is that, for the sake of temporary expediency, the government can disregard the interests and needs of the people, and use the two words "military administration" to silence the masses. Indeed, because military administration can concentrate power and act decisively, it naturally has many merits in the midst of reconstruction, as long as it is for the benefit of the people. However, in people's minds, these two words are associated with unpleasant things, and in the midst of peace and prosperity, they really don't want to see or hear them anymore.

The Hong Kong authorities are aware of the psychology of the people and have been stepping up the restoration of civil administration. Some colonial administration experts have recently come to Hong Kong from London. "To facilitate future work, they often hire Chinese teachers in their spare time to learn the Cantonese language. Therefore, in addition to the documents that need to be handled, they often carry a Cantonese reader in their briefcases." Earlier this month, Hong Kong newspapers widely reported that civil administration would be restored on April 1st. The Hong Kong government has ordered former employees to report for duty. The selection of the Civil Governor is also under speculation.

Two Different Statements

Military Administrator General Harcourt, under the orders of Lieutenant General Summerall, returned to England on the 2nd of this month to discuss the Hong Kong issue with the Colonial Office. A week later, Major General Festing, Commander-in-Chief of the Hong Kong Army, told reporters: civil administration is expected to be restored in Hong Kong within three months. From General Festing's authoritative words, even if the restoration of civil administration is not as rumored on April 1st, it will not be later than June 1st.

Merchants are particularly welcoming to the restoration of civil administration. According to them: (1) They can recover pre-war debts owed by the Hong Kong government or private individuals; (2) They can withdraw frozen bank deposits; (3) They can more easily purchase foreign exchange; (4) They can freely buy and sell goods and stocks... There are also those who express worries. They believe that after the restoration of civil administration: (1) The government will no longer maintain the sale of subsidized rice; (2) The rich will be even more powerful and can do whatever they want; (3) Landlords can arbitrarily increase rents or evict tenants; (4) Prices will continue to rise... Whether they welcome it or worry about it, everyone still hopes that civil administration will be restored soon, and the restoration of civil administration is gradually being realized in people's hopes.

Subsidized Rice is Gone

Food is the most important thing for the people. Besides civil administration, another issue of concern to everyone is the supply of rice. Of the seven necessities of life, rice is the most important. However, in the past few months, subsidized rice at the price of one yuan for five catties has been attracting people from the mainland to Hong Kong in droves. Seeing the increasing consumption of rice and the decreasing source of rice, the Hong Kong government first reduced the allocation of rice per person per day from one catty to twelve taels. The result was ineffective. The second step was to allocate half white rice and half flour — rice rationing in Hong Kong is five times a day, twelve taels per day, a total of four catties each time, and half of it is two catties. It is said that the supply of flour is more abundant than rice, so it was reduced to two pounds each time. The value of each pound of flour is the same as the value of each catty of rice. Although the allocation has been changed several times, the price of two cents per catty has remained the same until now. On the 8th of this month, the third step was to simply stop issuing new rice purchase certificates.

The Hong Kong authorities announced the reason for stopping the issuance of new rice purchase certificates: the source of rice in Hong Kong is based on the allocation of the Washington United Food Board, which is determined every three months according to the size of the Hong Kong population. Recently, due to the large influx of people from the mainland, the demand for rice exceeds the supply, and the Washington Food Board cannot increase the allocation of rice to Hong Kong in a timely manner. Therefore, Hong Kong must stop issuing new rice purchase certificates and warn people in mainland China: "There is no more subsidized rice in Hong Kong!"

Barely Filling the Stomach

According to Dr. Jiang Tingfu, the chief representative of our country to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, Hong Kong's rice allocation for the first quarter of this year is 34,000 tons. This number, if calculated at 12 taels per person per day, can supply more than 800,000 people without lack. (Hong Kong currently imports only 700,000.) However, according to a Hong Kong government spokesman, the actual amount of rice received by Hong Kong is less than half of the original allocation. Hong Kong residents will have to live on one meal of rice and one meal of noodles a day. This diet may not be unpalatable to fellow countrymen in Shanghai, but Cantonese people are not used to eating noodles. Now they have to barely fill their stomachs! Otherwise, they will have to eat black market rice, which costs one yuan to one yuan and four cents per catty, equivalent to about 600 yuan in national currency. How can the general salaried class or the poor afford it?

If the problem of food is not properly resolved, other social problems will follow, and complications will arise. Today's Hong Kong, the wind of theft has not subsided, and labor disputes are rampant like a flood that has burst its banks... Disappointed, people intentionally or unintentionally pin their hopes on civil administration, thinking that once civil administration is restored, the business community can hope to prosper, and social problems can be solved easily.

Currently, the people of Hong Kong are indulging in their dream of the restoration of civil administration. (March 22nd)

### Wuhan's Fear of Spring Chill

— Special Correspondent Zhou Yaiying, Hankou Air Dispatch, 24th

Winter in Spring

Since the beginning of spring, there has been continuous rain and cold weather here, and one cannot feel a bit of warmth. Moreover, in these drizzly days, there was even hail that had not fallen last winter, reaching a coldness that had never been experienced last winter. This has delayed the time for the spring dresses of the wealthy ladies and misses to flaunt on the streets, which is not a big deal. It is only pitiful for those poor people who have no clothes and the refugees from the rear, who thought that winter would be immediately followed by spring. Who knew that spring could not break free from the shackles of "winter." As a result, a new picture of refugees has been added under the eaves of the three towns. Hunger, disease, and death not only disturb the poor people, but also alarm the wealthy and make them feel insecure.

Earlier, it seemed that spring had also quietly visited once. The withered willows in the suburbs sparsely sprouted new buds. Especially Zhongshan Park, which breathed in and out tens of thousands of "spring tourists" all day long. Who would have thought that the climate would change so abnormally? After the willow branches sprouted, they were destroyed again. The "gentlemen" sighed with sadness for spring, and the farmers frowned and worried about the spring harvest and spring plowing. Everyone thinks that this phenomenon of spring practicing winter orders is too untimely.

However, on the other hand, Wuhan still seems to have spring. A group of "national disaster tycoons" who have returned home in glory, and another group of "elders" and "new nobles" who have been promoted to meritorious officials, are living their illusory spring in the gentle land of extravagance and sensual pleasures, forgetting everything in reality. But in their spring, there is no hidden worry of severe winter? The other night, the patrol officers of the police station cracked a bizarre case in a "villa" of a dancing star, where several magnates and traitors were gambling. Eleven gamblers and pleasure seekers were all brought to justice together, which can be regarded as covering their spring love with a layer of winter scenery!

This "Eastern Chicago's" spring cold symbolizes people's depressed mood. The deformed prosperity of the market cannot conceal the inner uneasiness. As of now, almost no one has rebuilt houses from the ruins. Everyone is taking a wait-and-see attitude, holding a thought of expectation, and sometimes even realizing that the expectation will be destroyed by reality, just as the scenery of spring is revealed and then destroyed by the remaining power of the severe winter. There is no beautiful and bright spring light here. If there is, it can only be said to be "winter in spring."

Grain Prices and Commodity Prices Race

In the winter in spring, people are even more afraid of the grain prices and commodity prices that fuel the power of the spring cold. In Hubei, the amount of military grain to be purchased this year is 600,000 large packages, and the prisoner grain is 200,000 large packages. The price of military grain is 50 yuan per catty, while the market price has already reached 300 yuan. This huge difference can only come from the people. When the troops ask the local government for grain, the township and Bao personnel will naturally be justified, and there will be incidents of extorting and demanding bribes. According to the appeals of the people in Hanyang, the military grain allocated to the entire county has actually exceeded the quota by more than five times. Originally, it may be excusable to purchase military grain under the current circumstances, but such heavy exploitation has too much impact on people's food.

The central government's waiver of land tax is a great benevolent policy, but the lower-level governments have not deeply realized it. After the land tax was waived, the county and township agencies ran out of funds and had to apportion the funds for autonomy to the people. There is no definite limit to the amount of apportionment. Taking Wuchang County as an example, the military grain and autonomy fees to be paid by each household this month amount to 12,200 yuan. It is even more imaginable in other places.

Due to various reasons, Wuhan has not only attracted many righteous people, but also many "farmers" who have come to take refuge. The righteous people who returned home cannot go home, and the farmers who have homes also have to flee together. Especially in the Dabie Mountains, as a result of the military conflict, more than 70% of the rural areas within a thousand miles have been abandoned, and almost no farmhouses are left. How can they not rush to the city to make a living?

The urgent need for military grain and the surge in the urban population have been enough to make the grain prices in this area soar. In addition, Hunan and Hubei have suffered natural disasters and man-made disasters for years, the harvest is not abundant, and the cultivated area is very narrow, which has already led to widespread food shortages. In addition, transportation is difficult, and it is not easy to get outside assistance. Idle funds are rampant, and the trend of hoarding rice and national goods is becoming more and more intense. As a result, grain prices and commodity prices are competing to rise. A few days ago, a magistrate of Badong County committed suicide in Wuchang. The last words he left were: "I cannot bear to exploit the people, and I cannot afford to feed my family. I have to choose the path of suicide!" Indeed, grain prices and commodity prices are devouring people. The salaried class who keep themselves clean has suffered a more terrible misfortune than during the war.

"Commodity prices jump, everyone is noisy, the whistle blows, everyone laughs!" In public places, peddlers often sing such songs. Everyone seems to understand that the solution to the commodity problem is to increase production and to make transportation smooth, so they hope that the whistle of the ship will blow, the whistle of the train will blow, and the whistles of the factories will blow together. However, the railway line has not been smooth, the Yangtze River water level is still falling, and other industrial rehabilitation is also stagnant. It is still a distant dream to suppress commodity prices through production and transportation!

According to Chairman Wang, who returned from Chongqing, the central government has decided that the purchase price of military grain in each province will be calculated based on the average market price of several markets in the province, and will be determined once and will not be changed again. This is a fairly reasonable decision. If the local governments can follow it properly, then "the previously depressed low-pressure will have a chance to clear up.

### Avaricious Officials and Treacherous Merchants are Like a Gust of Cold Wind, Chilling the Citizens

"Wuhan has two different kinds of people who create the same world. They only wish that the pain of others deepens, so they can obtain excessive happiness." A scholar, Mr. Gu Shi, an old professor, also expressed such a view when passing through here. Regardless of whether it was a complaint or a sigh, it is worthy of deep reflection. In recent days, corruption is like a gust of wind, and treacherous merchants are also like a gust of wind. These two gusts of wind blow into one world, causing most people to tremble under their lewd power.

According to Mo Heng, a special commissioner of the Executive Yuan, the enemy and puppet materials received amount to more than 2,000 kinds, with a value of more than 2,000,000,000,000 yuan. The government had long planned to sell them all to suppress local prices. However, the receiving agencies were stacked on top of each other, without clear authority. What should not have been received has already been received, and what was ordered to be received must be forced to be handed over. Even several large holes were found in the walls of the warehouse, and most of the materials disappeared. The demand for handover was sloppy, and the receiver refused to stamp the inventory. Receiving scandals of this kind are being played out in different ways. No one cares that the government's income should be immediately turned over to the national treasury, and the large quantities of materials expected by the people should be immediately moved into the market.

There are many people who have taken this opportunity to make a fortune in the recovered areas. Since they have millions in their pockets, they organize various enterprises and companies here in disguised ways to seek personal economic development. As a result, bureaucrats collude with big merchants, and merchants cling to influential officials, creating a "united front." In each larger company, the chairman of the board is mostly an important figure, and the manager is definitely a merchant. The manager shows his skills in business, and if something goes wrong, the chairman will take responsibility. These two types of people use each other to build their own happiness on the suffering of others, while the poor and impoverished common people are crushed to the point of suffocation.

When the reporter first arrived in Wuhan, the selling price of one shi of cooked rice was only 4,000 yuan, but now it has broken through the 40,000 yuan mark. A pack of matches used to cost only 10 yuan, but now it sells for 50 yuan. A catty of soybean oil used to cost only 180 yuan, but now it sells for more than 800 yuan. Previously, perhaps these reasons could be explained by the "law of supply and demand" from an economic perspective. But now, the problem does not conform to scientific principles in that way. As long as you can borrow capital, you can easily make a hundredfold profit. Whether you hoard or sell, the wartime regulations for controlling materials have been abolished, and you can manipulate them as you please. Because of this, although the monthly interest rate on high-interest loans here reaches four percent, the wealthy gods of wealth do not worry about not having a place to lend.

It seems that the work of strictly punishing corruption and purifying officialdom is also being carried out here. But apart from the county magistrates of Wufeng, Dangyang, and Yingshan counties, who are being sent to the court by the provincial government for investigation for corruption and dereliction of duty, other cases, such as Xiong Fei, a section chief of the Ministry of Transportation, who embezzled more than 50,000,000 yuan due to his initial use of power, and engaged in private fraud, was only sentenced to twelve years in prison. Ye Qianxiong, a section chief of the provincial government, sold public property worth tens of thousands of yuan, but still just left without a trace. When the various councils pursued the Ye case with the provincial authorities, the reply was: "Comrade Ye is a backbone cultivated by the state. Let you seniors continue to give him a way to reform himself!" Such corruption cases are being leniently let go so easily, which is truly inexplicable!

"Two kinds of people created the same world." Only the poor and impoverished common people are living through the winter of the South Pole and the celebration of the North Pole, and it is not easy for them to receive warmth.

Were the Scars Healed?

From an outward observation, after the recovery of the homeland, the brand-new national flags are constantly dazzling with light, fluttering in the wind, emitting some peaceful and warm feelings. Several bustling city streets also seem to have healed their scars and are gradually becoming prosperous. But this is only a signal of rebirth, and cannot be regarded as the essence of rebirth.

First, look at the city appearance. Japanese prisoners were used to clean up the ditches here, eliminating a lot of filth. In the middle of last month, in order to prepare for the inspection of a certain public figure, a large-scale cleaning inspection was also carried out, mobilizing 62,400 people, who swept away 1,938 tons of garbage in three days. This cannot but be regarded as a great achievement of the various bureaus of the municipal government. Unfortunately, time has passed and old habits have returned. Dangerous walls have not been repaired, street cleaners are rarely equipped, and sewage in the sewers and garbage on the streets still stink to the sky and pile up like hills. As for repairing roads and running public welfare undertakings, the municipal government's income is insufficient, and even the salaries of the staff are still in arrears of more than 33,400,000 yuan, making it even more powerless, and it can only allow them to remain incomplete.

"Spring is worrying!" According to the "prediction" published by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, after the war, there may be more than 100 kinds of epidemics in Wuhan. Each kind of patient may number in the hundreds of thousands. Although this terrible prediction has not yet become a reality, according to the report of the Municipal Health Bureau, smallpox, diphtheria, and encephalitis have spread in the poor people's residential areas. In response to this fact, effective prevention should be carried out. However, Wuhan's sanitary facilities are not even up to the most basic conditions. In addition to the original private hospitals and the health teams of the Rear Service Department and the Executive Yuan, there is only one provincial and one municipal hospital, with a total of only 340 beds. Therefore, the call for epidemic prevention is as tiring as the spring cicada, and all relevant parties have only made a few leaflets for epidemic prevention. In addition, such as injecting vaccines, setting up inspection stations, and opening isolation hospitals, are all still at a loss.

Another problem currently facing us is unemployment relief and industrial recovery. According to relatively accurate statistics from the provincial and municipal authorities, the number of unemployed people in Wuhan is more than 115,000, one-third of whom are skilled workers. The Ministry of Social Affairs has allocated 20,000,000 yuan to the Workers' Welfare Society to handle relief, half of which is used as small loans, and half of which is used to purchase tricycles and rent them to workers to drive in Wuchang. But this is a drop in the bucket, and it is feared that it will be difficult to provide relief. On the other hand, the remaining enemy and puppet industrial units originally numbered more than 300, but now only 84 units are under the custody of the Hubei Provincial Government. Among them, 29 units have been rectified and resumed work, and merged into eight factories for machinery, alcohol, oil refining, bricks and tiles, brewing, textiles, matches, and papermaking. The total number of workers in the eight factories is only more than 1,500, which is really pitiful. Although there are another dozen or so inland factories that are forming a joint association to prepare to resume work in Wuhan, there are many difficulties, and it is not known when the sound of looms can be heard. On the one hand, manpower is wasted, and on the other hand, industry is stagnant. How can people not be extremely melancholy?

Equally serious as the unemployment problem is the problem of out-of-school children and youths. At present, the Ministry of Education has planned to allocate funds to hold ten temporary university preparatory classes and ten remedial classes here. The provincial government has set up two temporary middle schools in Wuchang and Hanyang, and five provincial capital elementary schools. The Han Municipal Government has also run one middle school for boys and one for girls, and seventeen Hui elementary schools. Adding in the original private schools, it can be considered quite impressive. However, the number of out-of-school people in Wuhan has exceeded 80,000, and the capacity of existing schools is far from meeting the needs. Moreover, there is a serious housing shortage, and there is no place for school buildings. The preparatory classes and remedial classes planned by the Ministry of Education are still indefinitely delayed in starting. Even the Municipal Fourteenth Elementary School, which already has school buildings, caused elementary school students to petition and cry because the landlord took it back for his own use. Under these circumstances, the children who get the opportunity to study are only a small number of playboy children introduced by dignitaries. Their elegant figures often appear in dance halls, and even create a new situation with strange talks of holding school affairs meetings in dance halls! Such bad school practices should be corrected.

The reporter finally wants to say: In the rebirth of Wuhan, there is indeed anemia and corrosive bacteria. I believe that the spring scene with winter intentions will definitely become a thing of the past. Then, in the next dispatch, I will try to report some bright aspects! (March 24)

### The True Face of "Democratic" Politics in the "Liberated Area" of Northern Jiangsu Today

Dear Editor,

"Northern Jiangsu" and "Southern Jiangsu" are only separated by a river. Today's Southern Jiangsu is becoming more and more stable and prosperous. Especially those who live in big cities, their ears, eyes, mouths, and noses are steamed by songs, dances, wine, and food, and they have gradually forgotten the atmosphere of gunpowder for eight years. But in Northern Jiangsu, separated by a river, even today, nearly a year after the victory, nine-tenths of the people are still living a life of suffering, struggling and weeping. And it is not known when this kind of life, where one cannot live nor die, will end!

The author, during the Lunar New Year, used the excuse of going out to pay New Year visits, and after countless efforts and suffering that is difficult to express, only recently arrived in the "paradise" of Southern Jiangsu. Recalling the situation in my hometown, it is as if it is another world. And the current situation of the "liberated area" in Northern Jiangsu, which seems like another world, may be unimaginable to non-outsiders.

In the "liberated area," the "political instructor" is the highest authority in each small area. And all the measures of the "political instructor" are completely based on the orders of the "Party." Their armed forces—the so-called "people's armed forces"—are absolutely their "tools" for all their actions. In addition to their regular army, they have widely organized "militia teams" to serve as their military pawns. Any military action is to have the militia go to the front, and the regular forces closely follow the militia with machine guns. If the militia retreat in the face of battle, there is also an "unglorious" dead end behind them. Therefore, every time they want to complete their "mission," the death and injury of thousands of militiamen is not considered anything. If the side being attacked cannot bear to harm these innocent civilians and retreat somewhat, they have fallen for their "bitter trick." If they really fight back, they will have more material for propaganda. The more able-bodied civilians die in the "liberated area," the more desolate agriculture and industry become. The surviving people also have to be busy with constantly launching "comfort," "donations," from grain and firewood to clothing, shoes, and socks, and even young women and children, nothing is not included.

At the same time, the authorities in the "liberated area" are most jealous of intellectuals and people who have some prestige in the local area. Because this is the biggest "obstacle" to their work. Obstacles must be eliminated! In order to realize the spirit of "democracy," first add the names of "stubborn," "local tyrant," and "Trotskyite" to the people who are to be dealt with. Then, convene a people's congress to "publicly try" them. When holding the people's congress, all men, women, old, and young in the entire area must participate. Whoever does not participate is "resisting orders," which is unbearable. At the meeting, the instructors guide in groups, first calling the person being publicly tried to go on stage to "confess." If what is said does not meet their expectations, it is "not confessing" and must be said again. If the confession is still not up to par, then the "people's representatives" who are squeezed next to the instructors will come out to refute. After one refutation, the instructor immediately puts it to a "vote." Who dares to touch the tiger's whiskers in the face of the instructor's words! In this way, the obstructive elements are eliminated in accordance with the people's public opinion, and the spirit of "democracy" is thus fully demonstrated.

Now all regions have "elected" administrative personnel and established "people's" administrative institutions. The methods are all the same. In these years of suffering, the common people only hope that no one will make trouble for them, and that they can eat tree bark and grass roots in peace, without making other extravagant hopes. Helplessly, even this tiny hope, which could not be smaller, has not been given to them! They dare not seek even half a trouble with the military and political authorities again. Of course, they can only obey any orders and instructions.

The people in this area do not have a relatively complete residence. The more tidy houses have all been torn down cleanly. Even the dogs that guard livestock and food in farmhouses have been killed, leaving not a single one. A dog, born as a dog, certainly does not know what crime it has committed! Before the victory, they did this, saying it was to avoid the activities of the Japanese invaders. After the victory, there are still many houses, even the ruined walls that have been demolished, that continue to be demolished, saying that the remnants of the "bourgeoisie" must be wiped out before it is good. Landowners with a bit of land, under the auspices of the "Farmers' Resistance Association," launch a movement called "overturning rent," coaxing the grain households to withdraw the rent that was previously collected according to daily compound interest. If they cannot withdraw the money and grain, they will take out the land to calculate. Because the grain households only have the obligation to withdraw rent and pay "public grain," and collecting rent is out of the question. They also need merchants to absorb grain seeds and materials needed outside the "liberated area," but the price paid is "resistance currency," which is forty or fifty times more than the legal currency. As for the legal currency there, it is as unusable as the "Central Reserve Bank Notes" of the past, even worse than counterfeit money! Newspapers and magazines printed outside the "liberated area" are all on the list of prohibited items. One of the author's relatives, inadvertently, when returning from Taizhou, was found to have a newspaper that was used to wrap shoes, which was a Shen Bao from four months ago, and it caused a very, very big trouble! There is no freedom to read newspapers and books, and there is even less talk of freedom of speech. The post offices in many places have been forcibly taken over by the "Transportation Bureau," expelling all the original employees and appointing others to handle them. The stamps have also been replaced with a kind printed with a portrait of Mao Zedong. It is certainly extremely difficult for the people to communicate with the outside non-"liberated area," and even in-area communication is subject to strict inspection. If it is discovered that the people have communicated with those related to the central government, they will be regarded as traitors, and there is an immediate danger of losing their family and life! Although victory is nearly a year away, those who have served in the government or army, or have engaged in resistance and construction work in the rear, are still not allowed to return to their homes. Their family members who have fallen into this area are called "stubborn relatives." Tearing down houses naturally starts with the houses of "stubborn relatives," and the men, women, old, and young of "stubborn relatives" are permanently severely discriminated against, and even sighing is impossible! As for the officials sent by the central government to take office after the victory, there are many who have lost their lives in inexplicable ways. The county magistrate and administrative commissioner of Huaiyin County are recent examples. However, traitors who once participated in pseudo-organizations and truly cooperated with the enemy are not on the list of those who are paying attention; perhaps because these people can make money, they are very close to them in doing business. Although their superiors may not be fully aware of this kind of business.

Most of the people living in the "paradise" do not pay much attention to this barren area of Northern Jiangsu. However, the CCP regards it as a very good "granary," and even a lot of food outside this area is taken from here. This vast plain is indeed a "land of fish and rice." Even the items needed in the cities of Southern Jiangsu, such as cotton, beans, wheat, sorghum, as well as pigs, cattle, geese, and ducks, are 60% supplied by Northern Jiangsu. Only because the transportation here is inconvenient and it is not easy to attract outsiders to investigate, the outside world is not very clear about the actual situation, so it is inevitable to ignore it. And those who have ulterior motives in here are just taking advantage of this opportunity that the central government and the public do not pay much attention to, and they can do whatever they want, creating the current situation! When the news of victory first spread to Northern Jiangsu, everyone was so excited, thinking that they could escape from the water and fire and ascend to the comfort of mats; who knew that until now, the situation is still so bad; the comfort of mats is not known where it is, and the pain of the situation is as deep as water and as burning as fire!

The author recently received a message from home, relayed many times, that my family has also been labeled as "stubborn relatives!" At present, they are demanding that my "stubborn relatives" hand me over within a limited time! I dare not go back, nor do I want to go back to die. Although I know that wandering to Southern Jiangsu, there is no place for me to live in the "paradise," but to be a stray duckweed in the "paradise," the spirit is still much more cheerful.

### Strange Phenomena in Wartime Japan

— Lu

On trains and in hotels, meals are limited to a fixed amount of rice exchanged for a food allowance. It has become common knowledge that if you go to a friend's or relative's house for a meal, you must also take out a corresponding amount of rice in exchange, and there is no need to be polite. For us foreigners residing here, originally, if we wanted to leave the county where we lived, we had to report to the police station and apply for a permit. Later, even if we wanted to leave the city or town where we lived, we were subject to this restriction.

Movies and Theater

### Movies and Education

— Chen Gange

Education is a kind of life experience, using words to convey it to later generations. No matter what, education in China today goes through a translation process. Training such talents, as it is currently, requires a long period of training to become an average individual of knowledge, let alone talking about technology. How can we achieve any educational development? Because of this, some have suggested the Latinization of Chinese, using Roman letters to string together the language of our country. This seems like it can simplify our writing, but in fact, Chinese characters have been the sole sharp tool for expressing Chinese culture for thousands of years. How can they be abolished overnight? However, the space Chinese characters occupy is a large benign tumor in cultural progress. In this rapidly changing era, those who care about education should always worry about our benign tumor!

But, some might ask: Who told you to be born in China in this era? Since you cannot personally witness all kinds of facts happening, then you have to recognize them one by one from Chinese characters!

That's right. In fact, everyone cannot personally see every event and must go through the translation of words to increase some knowledge. No wonder a diligent middle school student must hold onto books, complete ten math problems, then turn to history, read geography, look up at the clock, and it is already midnight. And the homework to be read (prepared) is still such a pile. Middle school students, after ten years of studying, cannot even talk about research, only reading, reading, reading for ten years. Time binds them very strictly, so even research cannot be talked about. From this, we can infer: Is it possible that China really does not have talents? The reason that Chinese education does not talk about technology and is not research-oriented is definitely not a shortcoming of the writing system, we can say with certainty.

Chinese education is not hindered by the writing system, but by the educational period being stretched out too long. Imagine, from reading cow, sheep, grass, and flowers to understanding the explanation of zhi hu ye zai, it also takes so much time. — Actually, the true Chinese class is only five hours each week. The rest, such as arithmetic, history, geography, nature, art, …… so much that they forget the cow, earth, grass, and flowers they just taught. This says: Is the word cow difficult? I say: New is more difficult!

For example, history. The teacher holds the book and reads out the establishment of the Three Kingdoms of Wei, Shu, and Wu, and asks: "Do you all understand?" Students must study hard for several hours at home before they can understand the situation of the three-way division. If the Three Kingdoms of Wei, Shu, and Wu were put on the silver screen, they would not only know immediately, but even be able to shout out which one is right and which one is wrong.

For example, geography. Rising coasts and sinking coasts, local customs. If they were moved to the silver screen, students would no longer find geography boring.

Some would ask back: It's easy to say. Don't you know that China is poor? There is no money, and schools cannot build movie theaters. Do you know that?

How could I not know? At the same time, I also know that many schools can be converted or have existing grounds, but they definitely would not do so, and filmmakers would not put rising and sinking coasts into the camera, because it would not make money to show them to students and have them researched. What's more, entertainment donations are the income of the Finance Bureau, and education funding is the expenditure of the Education Bureau!

But we have to shout loudly:

"Simplify education!"

### The Difficulties of Children's Theatre Movement

— Jiong

Seeing Mr. Tang Shaohua's call for building a "Children's Theatre" evokes deep emotions.

The construction of a "Children's Theatre" is urgently needed; but before construction, promoting children's groups, developing children's plays, and gaining sympathy and importance for children's theatre should be necessities to strive for and achieve!

Our "Jian Jian Theatre Company" was established in the spring of 1940 under such a premise. During the occupation, to avoid "registration" and the attention of the enemy and puppets, we used names like "Shanghai Shanghai Opera Company Jian Jian Group" and performed eight times.

After the victory, we also performed twice at "Russia,"

But what was the result?

The social response was not very great, but the energy expended was extremely large.

This is a difficult and thankless task.

Now, I want to share some difficulties learned from experience, hoping that like Mr. Tang, drama workers with a "child's heart" will work together to overcome them.

1. Shortage of Scripts: The entire theatre circle is complaining, but children's scripts can be said to be a "desert." The two multi-act plays and more than ten one-act plays we performed were all written by ourselves.

2. Shortage of Directors: Professional directors are indeed unaffordable for "children." Even directors with some research and achievement cannot be invited due to being busy or other reasons. Our directors are either ourselves or other amateur enthusiasts.

3. Shortage of Time: The actors in children's plays are mostly students from elementary and middle schools, but the class times of Shanghai's elementary and middle schools are not uniform. If you want to rehearse after 4 o'clock, some schools have classes until 6 o'clock; on Sundays, some schools also have classes. So we have to rehearse at night, but elementary school students have to be escorted home after 9 o'clock, which doubles the personnel effort. Sometimes, the non-uniform "small exams" of various schools prevent rehearsals.

4. Children are prone to colds, which is very common among most malnourished Shanghai children. We often encounter situations during rehearsals where someone has a cold or a headache, and we have to stop temporarily. Once, during a performance at "Xuan Gong," a child suddenly fell ill, causing chaos.

5. Financial Strain: In the summer of 1940, we performed at the "Ningbo Association," and the tickets were only sold for thirty and fifty cents, which was enough to cover expenses. But after the victory, it was different. Last October, we performed three shows at the "Russian Art Theatre" and lost more than four million puppet currency. It was all paid for by the few teachers among us deducting their salaries. Later, we rehearsed "Love Education" and planned to perform it on New Year's Day. After inquiring about the prices of theatres, scenery, lighting, etc., they had increased by an average of fifteen times. How could we afford it? We had to "blow" the rehearsed play.

6. Society Disregards Children: This is our old Chinese tradition, thinking that children are always not very good; although those who have seen our plays say they are acceptable, and some even say "not easy." But if the ticket price is the same as ordinary amateur theatre companies, it will inevitably be "laughed at." The ticket price has to be lowered, but the expenses are the same as other theatre groups. Sometimes, we even encounter "They're performing kids' plays, let's rip them off." How can we afford this?

7. Most Teachers Do Not Understand the Importance of Drama Education: Our target audience is primarily students. However, most teachers do not give us sympathy and help. They think that acting is just "playing around," and even some stubborn people in some schools forbid children from joining the drama club.

The above are the actual difficulties we have encountered in the work of the children's theatre movement over the past seven years. To rescue children from lewd entertainment and promote genuine children's drama education, we must overcome these difficulties before building a "Children's Theatre," and we must overcome them immediately.

### Film and Drama Groups with the "China" Signboard

— Ledao

In the rear, most of the film and drama groups were government-run, so their names usually started with "Central," "China," or "Chinese." Even those that were privately run also started with the word "China," all with the "China" signboard. Since the victory, these "China"-headed film and drama groups have come east one after another. Some rely on the "China" signboard to take over, and some want to use it to compete for territory. Because there are so many "China"s, outsiders may inevitably be confused. Now, I will list them all to see how many "China" signboards there are.

"China Electric": This is the abbreviation of the Central Film Studio, directly under the Central Propaganda Department. It was originally located in Nanjing and moved west to the South Bank of Chongqing after the Anti-Japanese War. The original studio in Nanjing was destroyed during the war and was later rebuilt into many bungalows by the enemy and puppets. The "China Film" factories in Shanghai that were taken over this time and assigned to "China Electric" included the Cultural News Film Studio in Zhabei, the Guohua Factory after being bought by "China Film," the "China Film" production department on Haig Road, and the "China Film" office on the third floor of the Hamilton Mansion.

"China Film": This is the China Film Studio, directly under the Political Department of the Military Affairs Commission. Its predecessor was the Film Section of the Political Training Office of the Hankou Headquarters. It was established in Wuhan in the early days of the Anti-Japanese War and moved to Chongqing to build a factory before the fall of Wuhan. This time, it took over the "Yi Hua" factory and the "Lian Hua" factory in the triangle area of Xujiahui, and its management and distribution departments were also located on the third floor of the Hamilton Mansion.

"China Education": This is the China Education Film Studio, directly under the Ministry of Education. It specializes in shooting 16mm silent films. It was established in the autumn of 1942, and its factory was located in Beibei Hot Spring, Chongqing. Because it was newly established, the outside world had a relatively shallow impression of it. During this victory takeover, it did not get anything. The Central Propaganda Department is now planning to allocate the old site of "China Electric" in Nanjing to "China Education," which can also be said to be "equal distribution."

In addition to the above film production organizations, there are also drama groups:

"China Wansui": This is the abbreviation of the China Wansui Drama Troupe, which is affiliated to "China Film," and its staff are also from "China Film." In recent years, it has performed very little in Chongqing. Recently, it plans to reorganize in Shanghai and regroup.

"China Electric Drama Troupe": This was originally an amateur organization affiliated to "China Electric." Because it could not shoot films in the rear, performing plays could also support the facade. After moving from Chongqing to Shanghai, it could not find a performance venue for a while, which was quite troublesome. Recently, it started performing "Wan Shi Shi Biao" at the Lyceum Theatre. In terms of organization, it will appear in a self-sufficient manner and gradually become independent from "China Electric."

"China Art": The China Art Theatre Company, organized by Zhao Zhiyou, Jin Shan, etc., collapsed due to internal economic collapse before the victory.

"Chinese Art": The Chinese Drama Art Society, hosted by Ying Yunwei, struggled in Chongqing, Chengdu, and other places for several years and is still in the mainland.

"China Youth": The Central Youth Drama Society of the Three People's Principles Youth League, also a government-run example, was successively headed by Ma Yan and Zhang Junxiang. In the past year or two, it seems to be in a state of stagnation due to lack of leadership.

In addition, there were also "Roar," "Amateur," and several other "established in name only" and "fleeting" groups in Chongqing. Because they did not use the "China" signboard, there is no need to elaborate.

Weekly Film Review

### Listed in the Annals of History

— Lang Huan

"Listed in the Annals of History" is a colorful war film produced by MGM, directed by Simon. It is also a film made by Huarez Pires to commemorate his 30 years in the film industry and dedicated to the US Navy. Huarez Pires' acting skills have long been praised by the audience, but in this film, we can see that he is going all out. This method of commemoration is indeed very meaningful because this effort adds a brilliant page to the glorious history of Huarez and Lai.

In this film, Huarez Pires plays a sergeant major who retired after serving for 30 years. Because the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, which evolved into the invasion of the Philippines, he rose up and recruited volunteers to form a militia to defend his motherland. Although this group of passionate men inflicted fatal blows on the Japanese invaders, they eventually died heroically due to the disparity in strength.

The flesh and blood of the martyrs could not withstand the enemy's artillery fire, but their impassioned spirit had shattered the Japanese invaders' dreams. They not only shocked the invaders' courage, but also awakened a group of people who defended their motherland, laying the foundation for the fate of restoring their homeland.

Huarez Pires' generous personality is indeed very suitable for the role he plays in this film. His impassioned actions can grasp the plot of each scene very well. The war scenes are very realistic, and it is said that they were filmed in cooperation with the US Navy.

In the tragic story, there are also some stories of young lovers. The good thing is that these do not loosen the theme but add to the interest of life. Faber Indes plays the sergeant major's wife, and her expression is very delicate. In addition, Le Jinler Owen, who plays the Nazi, Marilyn McSwire, who plays the sergeant major's daughter, and Rego Lins, who plays the sergeant major's subordinate, are all very competent.

Character Introduction

### Ray Milland's Success

— Xin Ming

Ray Milland is now thirty-eight years old. He has been married for fourteen years. His wife's name is Manly White, a lady with silver hair and purple-blue eyes. They already have a child, a five-year-old boy named Danery, and the family is harmonious.

The above is the latest family situation of Hollywood's number one star today; the winner of the 1945 "Oscar" statue. Before Ray entered Hollywood, he studied at the Royal Academy of Cambridge. Later, he also studied mechanical engineering at Wales University for a year. But he felt lonely, without dancing, riding, or outdoor throwing, so he moved from stillness and said the hope of "66 system" is that six years should be responsible for seeking knowledge, and six years should be active outward and work outward. So Ray left school at the age of twenty-one to play in Paris. From these points, it can be thought that Ray is a thorough mover. In that year, he met an English actress and wanted to devote himself to the stage, but was rejected by this actress. Later, through Miss White Ruby's introduction, Ray finally achieved his ambition and went to Hollywood. And Hollywood also recognized this talented star. However, Hollywood stars are not all rising to the sky in one fell swoop. They succeed only after long-term efforts and development. Ray Milland is no exception.

You see, in "Ambassador Bill" and "Were Not Dressing," wasn't only a very unimportant supporting role given to him? It wasn't until he co-starred with Claudette Colbert in "The Gilded Lily" and with Dorothy Lamour in "Jungle Princess" that he gradually emerged. He only began to be noticed in "Beau Geste" and "The Major and the Minor." It wasn't until he starred in "The Lost Weekend" that he was unanimously praised and admired for his acting skills. In this film, he plays a drunkard, performing vividly and vividly. And from then on, he laid his foundation and future. So now Paramount is relying on him very much. This year, he has four films starring him. One, co-starring with Pauline Goddard in the costume love epic "The Trouble with Women," Three, co-starring with Theresa Wright in "The Imperfect Lady," Four, co-starring with Barbara Stanwyck in the martial arts five-color film "California." Shanghai movie fans should wait for the arrival of each film in Shanghai and wait and see!

### Reply to Readers

Shi Buwei asks: I recently read a magazine and learned that a German doctor invented a method of treating pulmonary tuberculosis and laryngeal tuberculosis by planting cutaneous tuberculosis, which has been effective in thousands of people. However, if cutaneous tuberculosis gradually heals, the original tuberculosis recurs. I think that perhaps due to the war, this method cannot be popular in the world. Please explain the principle for the research of the medical community.

Dr. Zhang Zhongming replies: Cutaneous tuberculosis is a skin disease caused by tubercle bacillus. If tubercle bacillus is artificially planted on the skin, the body can produce a special antitoxin. If this person also suffers from pulmonary tuberculosis, the antitoxin produced by cutaneous tuberculosis can also inhibit the spread of pulmonary tuberculosis. Its efficacy is still difficult to say.

### Searching for Traces
