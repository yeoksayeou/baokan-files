### Despite Only One Day Remaining in the Ceasefire, Hope for Peace Remains: Yu Ta-wei and Zhou Enlai Separately Visit Marshal

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] As of 12:00 midnight tonight, only thirty-six hours remain in the ceasefire period, but peace negotiations have not reached a completely hopeless situation. This morning, No. 5 Ninghai Road, which had been quiet for two days, showed significant activity. At 9:00 a.m., Minister of Communications Yu Ta-wei first visited Marshal Marshall's residence for a two-and-a-half-hour discussion. It is reported that Mr. Yu provided Marshal Marshall with reports on various developments in and outside the Pass (關內關外) over the past week for reference, and reiterated the exchange of views on the clause regarding the unified railway police authority in the new transportation restoration plan concerning transportation safety. According to an authoritative source, both the government and Marshal Marshall are very enthusiastic about restoring transportation. It is also said that the government has made the greatest concessions in this plan. Once the troop reorganization negotiations are successful, the agreement on restoring transportation will also be completed. This is because designating garrison areas for the reorganized and integrated Communist troops in accordance with the new troop reorganization plan and unifying road administration for transportation restoration are closely related and have a chain reaction. It is rumored that the government and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) had sought mutual guarantees for the "troop reorganization" and "road restoration" plans, seeking relative agreement. It is possible that there was such intent. However, as of tonight, there has been no formal request from either side. However, three days ago, Minister Yu mentioned that the negotiations on restoring transportation were expected to be announced in three days. If so, then today's meeting between Marshall and Yu must have made a decisive discussion.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] CCP representative Zhou Enlai visited Marshal Marshall's residence before 4:00 p.m. today for a lengthy discussion of about one hour. The content of the conversation was not released. It is not yet known whether Mr. Zhou has received a reply telegram from Yan'an, but Mr. Zhou today issued a propagandistic statement to the CCP's own Xinhua News Agency, stating briefly: Regarding the peace negotiation issue that is attracting national attention, two propositions are put forward as follows: (1) Regardless of inside or outside the Pass, all conflicts should cease without time limit, pending mediation; (2) If the Kuomintang-Communist dispute requires mediation by friendly nations, it should only be handled in accordance with President Truman's statement of December 15th last year and the principles agreed upon in the Moscow Three-Nation Announcement. After Mr. Zhou's statement was released, qualified observers stated that today, less than two days before the ceasefire deadline, he did not talk about practicalities but about Truman's statement of December 15th last year and the Moscow Three-Nation Announcement. Although his posture is new, his intentions remain the same, and his ultimate goal is to "delay". [Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] After the meeting with Mr. Zhou Enlai, Marshal Marshall went to Chairman Chiang's residence for discussions. According to sources from the Third Party, Chairman Chiang entrusted Marshal Marshall today with a supplementary plan for the arbitration right to be forwarded to the CCP, and it is said that Marshal Marshall delivered it to Zhou Enlai that evening. If so, then the saying circulating among Third Party figures today that Marshal Marshall's arbitration can be expected to be decided decisively within a few days in another way is not without cause. [United Press Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] Zhou Enlai today flatly rejected Special Envoy Marshall's suggestion to arbitrate the China issue. [United Press Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] Government officials stated today that Chairman Chiang recently suggested that the Communist troops withdraw from Binjiang and important seaports in the provinces of North China. If the CCP accepts this, the government can sign an agreement to restore transportation. At the same time, CCP officials disclosed that if government troops withdraw from the locations occupied after the January 10th ceasefire agreement, then the Communist troops will also withdraw from the cities occupied after the June 7th announcement of the fifteen-day ceasefire in the Northeast. Since Chairman Chiang put forward supplementary suggestions for reorganizing the army, the negotiations have been in a deadlock for two days. Zhou Enlai finally submitted a statement to Special Envoy Marshall, but the public's tense mood at this extremely critical time has not been eased as a result. The Democratic League is now advocating for the continuation of peace talks without restrictions.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] From 2:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. today, Democratic League representatives Huang Yanpei, Zhang Junmai, and Luo Longji visited Zhou Enlai to discuss the issue of arbitration rights. Around 3:00 p.m., Zhou Enlai went to Ninghai Road to meet with Special Envoy Marshall by appointment. It is said that Mr. Zhou submitted to Marshal Marshall the CCP's latest propositions on ceasefire, troop reorganization, and transportation restoration and returned at 5:00 p.m.

### Shao Lizi Tells Reporters: Good News Must Come Today or Tomorrow; Democratic League Youth and Social Figures Hosted Government Representatives in Nanjing Yesterday

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] According to an observer who is eager for peace, who told our reporter: The situation has clearly told the people that it is impossible to hope for an indefinite ceasefire or a limited extension of the ceasefire, or to relax the ceasefire deadline by a few days in a casual manner, because a country without faith will perish, and people without faith cannot stand. If a political party is untrustworthy, then its own party morality will be lost, and everything will become deception. In his opinion, if some progress can be made in the next twenty-odd hours to give practical hope for the future of peace negotiations, it may be possible to extend the deadline for a few days on the grounds of completing the negotiation procedures, but the period must not be long, because the national people will not easily drag on in such a muddled way. Furthermore, according to Mr. Shao Lizi, Mo Dehui, and Lei Zhen, who told our reporter that although the ceasefire deadline is approaching, the prospect of peace is still optimistic. We should pray for the future of the nation and the country with an optimistic mood, and seek peace with a compassionate heart. Shao Lizi also told our reporter: Good news will come out as early as tomorrow, and as late as the morning after tomorrow. Please be patient.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] At about 4:00 p.m. today, the Democratic League, the Youth Party, and social figures in Nanjing hosted government representatives at a tea party in the National Assembly Hall. Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, Shao Lizi, Lei Zhen, and Wang Yunwu attended. The government representatives reported on the negotiations on the three items suggested by Chairman Chiang related to the Northeast ceasefire, transportation restoration, and troop reorganization and integration, as well as Marshal Marshall's arbitration rights, which lasted for about two hours. After listening to the report of the government representatives, third-party figures put forward the following three hopes, entrusted to the government representatives to submit to Chairman Chiang: (1) Hope to continue peace negotiations and eliminate internal strife forever; (2) Hope to thoroughly understand the negotiation process and solutions between the two parties; (3) Hope to move from military methods to political solutions and implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC). It is said that third-party figures are scheduled to hold a joint meeting at No. 15 Lanjiazhuang at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow.

### Government Representative of the Tenth Executive Group Killed

[United Press Peiping Dispatch, 20th] The Peiping Office of the Central Propaganda Department announced today that Guo Zheyuan (transliteration), a major and the government representative of the tenth executive group of the Military Mediation Executive Department, was killed by the Communist Party yesterday en route from Xinxiang to Xiuwu. Xiuwu is located twenty miles west of Xinxiang, Hebei.

### Minister Peng Xuan Says Arbitration Should be Called Public Judgment

[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] Recently, regarding the term arbitration right, there has been considerable controversy. The reporter specially visited Minister Peng of the Central Propaganda Department, who explained as follows: Public judgment is a Chinese term, while arbitration is a Japanese translation. "Zhong" means a middleman. In our country's customs, when brothers have a dispute, they ask neighbors to settle the matter with a drink and public judgment. In modern international disputes, the Hague Tribunal should be asked for public judgment, which does not harm sovereignty. The Japanese translated it as the final decision-making power, which is also inconsistent. Recently, official documents have been translated back and forth, and newspaper reports have been inconsistent, which inevitably leads to errors. All newspapers should pay attention and use the term "public judgment" from now on. Currently, the government is directly and indirectly discussing public judgment with the Communist Party on major issues, which seems to be the issue of implementation.

### Communist Party Fabricates Propaganda: The Peiping Military Mediation Office Requests Punishment

[United Press Peiping Dispatch, 20th] The government group of the Peiping Military Mediation Executive Department requested appropriate punishment for the illegal fabrication of propaganda by Kuang Hua (transliteration), the head of the Communist Party News Release Group of the department. On June 11, the group leader released a message to foreign reporters, stating that General Du Yuming had abolished the Fifteen-Day Ceasefire Agreement.

### Central Propaganda Department Issues Spokesperson's Remarks: Government's Concessions: Deeply Hope for a Response from the Communist Party

[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] The spokesperson of the Central Propaganda Department answered reporters' inquiries on the current situation of peace negotiations on the 20th as follows: "Various issues have been fully exchanged, and are quite detailed, but several important issues have not been resolved. Marshal Marshall and government representatives will make special efforts today and tomorrow to obtain the consent of the Joint Communist Party. The transportation issue seems easier to resolve, but the issue of troop reorganization and integration, and the garrison areas of the Communist troops has not yet been decided. The ceasefire period is about to expire. We sincerely hope that the Communist Party will respond to the government's concessions so that an agreement can be reached to comfort the public's expectations."

### The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Asks the Hong Kong Government to Pay Attention to Our Policy of Freedom of the Press

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 20th] Regarding the forced closure of the Kuomintang Daily in Hong Kong, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we have ordered our office in Hong Kong to urge the Hong Kong government to pay attention to our government's policy of "freedom of the press".

[Central News Agency Hong Kong, 19th] The Hong Kong Legislative Council will hold a meeting on the 20th to ask the Hong Kong government to issue a formal statement on the closure of the Kuomintang Daily.

### Promoting China's Unification and Maintaining Peace: The United States Should Continue Military Aid to China: Marshall Cables US Authorities, Urging Vigorously

[US News Agency Washington, 19th] Acting Secretary of State Acheson read a cable from President's Special Envoy to China General Marshall to the House Foreign Affairs Committee today, vigorously advocating that the United States continue to provide military assistance to China to maintain China's unity and stability. Acheson, Army Secretary Patterson, and Deputy Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Ramsey all attended the committee to testify on the military aid to China bill to modernize China's armed forces and enable China to fulfill its obligations to the United Nations. Marshall's cable stated that the assistance to China's ground forces stipulated in this bill will be implemented in accordance with the troop reorganization plan agreed upon by the Kuomintang and Communist Party representatives. Marshall said that the passage of this bill will "make efforts to promote peace and unification between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China easier to succeed". The cable also stated that the bill will support the US plan to promote a friendly and stable China. Marshall continued that military assistance to China has been planned for a long time, originating from the US assistance to China in the War of Resistance Against Japan during the war. Acheson emphasized the dual objectives of this legislation: (1) to assist the merger of the Kuomintang and Communist armies, and (2) to develop an effective force so that the United Nations Security Council can use it to maintain peace in the Far East.

All Armies Should Urgently Be Unified

Acheson read a statement reviewing China's difficult struggle for unity and the wartime US aid to China. He said that General Marshall believes that all Chinese army units should urgently be merged into one. This is the main goal of General Marshall's work. He is currently working to seek solutions to such complex problems, and we hope that he will achieve satisfactory results. The Communist army will be part of a non-partisan national army, but so far the Communist army still lacks sufficient organization, training and equipment. Therefore, the Communist army leaders have requested (and General Marshall has also agreed) to receive short-term US training and a minimum amount of equipment before the merger. Any assistance related to this decision in the coming months will contribute to the troop reorganization plan. Acheson further pointed out that according to General Marshall's plan, China's troop reorganization work is intended to "obtain the vast and urgent manpower needed for post-reconstruction work, and thereby save the Chinese government from maintaining the waste of a huge and poorly organized army". Acheson continued that if this work cannot be completed, we can hardly expect the Chinese government to have an "effective and orderly administration". According to General Marshall's plan, the total number of various troops in China is currently about 325 divisions. After the troop reorganization, it will be reduced to 60 divisions, of which 50 divisions will be the National Army and 10 divisions will be the Communist Army. The US military advisory group (with about 1,000 members) will be the main personnel for implementing General Marshall's plan. Acheson concluded that once the bill under consideration is passed, the US government will implement the plan mentioned in President Truman's statement on December 15, 1945. This plan is also "to assist China in establishing a military agency capable of fulfilling its responsibilities for maintaining domestic and international peace and order in China." In his statement on December 15, 1945, President Truman also said: "An unorganized and divided China will affect world peace and invite foreign interference."

Organized Like the United States

Patterson emphasized that China has specifically requested the United States to assist in reorganizing the Chinese army and reorganizing the Chinese Ministry of Military Affairs in accordance with the organization of the US Army Department. Patterson pointed out that the military assistance currently provided to China under the Lend-Lease Act will end at the end of this month. He said that the Army Department can obtain a large amount of surplus weapons from Japan and other Far East locations, which can be used for the implementation of the proposed China troop reorganization plan. Patterson said in response to a question that the scope of this assistance has not yet been estimated, and the entire plan depends on the quantity of surplus weapons finally declared in the Far East and China's needs. He said that the unified Chinese army and the Chinese Communist troops can only receive assistance when they become part of the unified government and army. The above bill authorizes the President of the United States to dispose of government-owned supplies by means of sale, exchange, lease, gift, or transfer, as he deems appropriate, except for naval supplies. Lanxi, representing the Navy Department, agreed to the proposal. The department had cooperated with the Army Department and the State Council to propose the bill. The Navy Department will also provide one-fourth of the personnel of the proposed US military advisory group. The House has passed another bill stipulating naval aid to China, which is currently awaiting a vote in the Senate.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] Foreign affairs circles reported that after Ambassador to the United States Wei Daoming returned to China, Gu Weijun was decided to be appointed as Ambassador to the United States. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is rushing to prepare the letter of credence. It is apparent that Ambassador Gu will soon travel from England to Washington to take office. It is said that Wei Daoming will be the head of the Judicial Administration Department, and it is also rumored that Foreign Vice Minister Liu Kai may be appointed as ambassador to the United Kingdom.

Wei Daoming Arrives in Beijing and Issues a Statement

[Central News Agency Nanjing, 20th] Ambassador to the United States Wei Daoming arrived in Beijing on the 20th at 1:30 p.m. by the Beijing-Shanghai train and is scheduled to pay a visit to Chairman Chiang within days to report on the situation. The reporter visited Ambassador Wei at his residence. Wei said: The US-China loan issue is not yet at the stage of announcement. Regarding the US government and public's views on our country, he said: Most are friendly, but criticism is unavoidable. A small number of criticisms are also due to lack of clear understanding of the facts. Regarding the current international situation, the ambassador emphasized that the Four-Nation Foreign Ministers Conference currently being held in Paris is very important and is the key to resolving current international disputes. When the reporter asked about the rumors that he would take up a new position, Wei replied in a humorous tone: Various rumors are still news to me. He continued: Before reporting to the central authorities, he is not convenient to express any opinions on any political issues.

### Bell Nas Once Proposed a Bill to Help Our Country Train Troops

[United Press San Francisco, 19th] US Secretary of State Bell Nas submitted a bill to Congress before his trip to Paris to attend the Foreign Ministers' Conference, which will have a significant impact on China. The bill proposed by Bell stipulated that the United States would assist China in forming a modern army of one million people. According to the agreement of January 10 this year, there will be 50 divisions of the National Army and 10 divisions of the Communist Army. At that time, an agreement was also reached on a ceasefire, but it has been broken. This bill will implement the US side's obligations in the agreement, which was originally based on the possibility of complying with the ceasefire. However, according to United Press reporter Hai Taohua's telegram from Washington: "Officials here expect the plan to build a modern Chinese army to be implemented regardless of whether peaceful negotiations are successful. Generally, it is believed that if negotiations fail, the United States will have no other way than to fully support Chairman Chiang in building a strong China."

### Communist Army Resorts to All Means to Create Terrorist Incidents: Deputy Commissioner of the Communist Party Security Bureau Discloses Conspiracy in an Open Letter

[Central News Agency Nanjing, 20th] A month ago, the Peiping Garrison Command received a letter from Ye Jianying of the Chinese Communist Party, saying that the car of CCP representative Song Shilun was shot. Generally, people have doubts about the inside story of this incident. Recently, relevant parties suddenly received a confidential letter. The sender was Song Chun, deputy commissioner of the Communist Party (Security) Bureau. The place of dispatch was No. 11 Qianjingji Road, Peiping. Song explained in the letter that he joined the Communist Party in 1931. In March of this year, he was ordered by the Central Political Security Bureau of the Communist Party to work in Peiping with Teng Daiyuan, Ye Jianying's military advisor. He was then instructed by the Chinese Communist Party in May to create terrorist incidents in Peiping. He did not think so. On Labor Day, he sent letters exposing such terrorist conspiracies of the Chinese Communist Party to the World Daily, Ta Kung Pao, Tianjin Minguo Daily, and China New Northern Daily, requesting disclosure. However, none of the newspapers published them. When the incident of Song Shilun's car being shot was reported, he then sent a confidential letter to relevant parties on May 19, requesting that the letters previously sent to various newspapers be examined and published. In his letter to various newspapers, he said: "The purpose of my publicizing this matter is for the peace and stability of the Chinese people, and for the revolutionary interests of my party, my army, and the proletariat. I am not violating the party, nor am I surrendering to other classes. I am still willing to be a Bolshevik, but objectively, I may not be understood by the party. I am willing to sacrifice myself for this and realize my correct position. After arriving in Peiping, I did see what the people are asking for. The people are asking for peace, democracy, and stability. And my party's policy is also moving in this direction, but I encountered difficulties. In such a calm Peiping environment, we felt that the progress of our work was slow and difficult. Therefore, I was instructed to create a serious incident to stimulate society and create a tense and active situation, so that we could take the opportunity to carry out our work. The higher authorities ordered that we should arrange a few terrorist activities in various gatherings, that is, kill a few comrades of our party and social celebrities, and create a massacre so that we could frame others (Comrade Li Zhaolin was sacrificed under this strategy). But I firmly oppose this practice. I believe that the current international and domestic situation is favorable to us. If we firmly support the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and unite with the democratic government, it is possible to achieve it. Why use such improper tactics? Why sacrifice a few comrades who have struggled hard without cause? I raised my objections to the higher authorities, but the higher authorities were unwilling to accept them and strictly criticized me, saying that I was right-leaning. I am not opposed to the entire line of the party, but I want to correct the erroneous style of some leaders." (His second letter, which was sent on May 19) said: "Do you know what happened to the shooting of CCP representative Song Shilun? I think you stupid guys will never know. Such things are just the beginning, and they will continue to happen in the future. Why don't you go and explore? I once sacrificed my position and revealed this matter in advance on May 1. On May 1, I wrote an open letter and sent it to the World Daily, Ta Kung Pao, Tianjin Minguo Daily, and North China Daily to publicize the political reasons for the assassination to the society. I thought it could prevent this kind of thing from happening, but unexpectedly, the newspapers were too prejudiced and unwilling to publish a letter from a Communist. As a result, the Song Shilun incident still occurred. Looking at the above, the contents of the two letters are enough to prove the Communist Party's despicable and shamelessness, resorting to all means to create terrorist incidents in an attempt to frame others. And the truth about the Song Shilun shooting incident can be fully revealed to the public.

### Communist Forces in Shandong, Shanxi, and Rehe Provinces Launch a Full-Scale Offensive in North China; Jinan Filled with Wartime Atmosphere for the Past Week

[Taiyuan, 20th] Today marks the twelfth day of the ceasefire. The period of peace in the Northeast only has thirty-six hours remaining. However, at the Peiping Union Medical College, the command center for peace negotiations, there is still not a single piece of good news to offer solace. Today, this reporter visited an official in charge and inquired about whether any agreement had been received from Nanjing, and about six or seven different questions, including whether the ceasefire would be extended. All the replies received were "Unknown!" However, the spokesperson emphasized that the communist forces' offensive in North China has almost fully commenced recently. The offensive in Shandong started on June 6th. The offensive in Shanxi started on June 10th. Currently, the Niangziguan Tunnel on the Zhengtai Railway has been blown up, and the railway leading to Shouyang has also been destroyed. After the communist forces in northern Shanxi occupied Shuoxian, they severed the Datong-Taiyuan Railway. In southern Shanxi, it is reported that Wenxi has fallen, Quwo and Jiangxian are besieged, and the railway between Linfen and Wenxi has also been destroyed. The provincial capital Taiyuan is now isolated. In Rehe, the communist forces in Lingyuan and Yebaishou have also launched an offensive. This reporter visited the CCP News Office of the Executive Headquarters. They showed me a telegram of over four thousand words from all members of the CCP groups of the Executive Headquarters (protesting the arrest and abuse of CCP personnel by local government troops). They did not make any further comments on the current situation. From nightfall, huge transport planes passed frequently overhead, seemingly without stopping for a moment. The red and green lights on the wings of the night-flying planes were almost indistinguishable from the scattered stars. The people of the ancient capital looked up to the sky in melancholy, and no one could predict whether the visitor in thirty-six hours would be the god of war or a white dove of peace.

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 20th] For the past week, Jinan has been filled with a wartime atmosphere. This is the inevitable result of the communist forces gradually approaching Jinan and beginning to besiege it. At midnight and in the early morning, citizens can listen intently to the faint sounds of artillery fire coming from the suburbs, sometimes mixed with continuous gunfire. The garrison troops at the bridgeheads are directing civilians to rush to build defensive fortifications and erect barbed wire fences. This measure is more akin to preparing for urban unrest than preparing for street fighting, because the suburban defenses are extremely solid. However, due to the ceasefire agreement, there are probably some dangerous elements lurking in the area. Citizens do not seem surprised by these preparations. A curfew is imposed every night from 10:00 PM to 5:00 AM the next morning.

### Kirk Sails to Qingdao

[Central News Agency, This City Report] Admiral Kirk, Commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet in China, went to Qingdao the day before yesterday.

Admiral Kirk's flagship, the USS Estes, also left Shanghai yesterday morning and sailed to Qingdao.

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 19th] The American warship USS Monrovia sailed to Qingdao from San Diego, USA, on the 19th, carrying over eight hundred officers and soldiers.

### Second Phase of Military Reorganization to be Completed by the End of the Month; Peiping and Tianjin Included in the Third Phase; Continuous Conflicts in North China Affect Progress

[This Newspaper, Peiping, 20th] The second phase of the government's military reorganization will be completed by the end of this month. By then, eighteen armies will have been reorganized. The military reorganization in the Peiping and Tianjin area is included in the second phase. If the conflicts in North China do not stop completely, it may be difficult to proceed as scheduled. When the entire military reorganization is completed in the future, after all the armies are reorganized into divisions, the government will abolish all high-level command headquarters above the army level. They will all be under the direct command of the Chief of the General Staff. As for local military administration, it will be handled by military regions. The authorities previously planned to divide the entire country into forty-two military regions, representing the Ministry of National Defense to implement conscription, training, and supply matters.

[This Newspaper, Suzhou, 20th] The Ministry of National Defense believes that the established plan for military reorganization and demobilization should be implemented quickly to demonstrate the government's determination to seek peaceful unification. Considering that various troops have moved around to various places due to the War of Resistance, and that there are many cases of substitutes filling in, in order to improve conscription and protect conscripted soldiers, Military Affairs Officer Ouyang of the Military Affairs Bureau was specially dispatched to various places to verify the stationed troops. After completing the verification work of the Kunshan garrison, Ouyang, accompanied by Section Chief Zhou Shuwu of the Military Affairs Section, arrived in Suzhou yesterday and has now begun the verification work of the 145th Brigade. This reporter made a special visit to him and was told about the mission. The main points are recorded as follows: (1) Those who are old and infirm should be discharged and returned to their hometowns. (2) Demobilization and retirement: All volunteers who have been approved to return to their hometowns and who have the conditions for changing careers should be allowed to change careers. (3) The names and registrations of soldiers retained in the camp must be accurate as a basis for improving conscription. (4) In addition to receiving a retirement allowance based on their years of service, all travel expenses and rations for demobilized and retired soldiers will be borne by the government.

### Hoping the CCP Will Change Its Style to Achieve Peaceful Unification; Chu Fucheng Discusses His Views on the Current Situation

[Central News Agency, This City Report] Councilor Chu Fucheng has been working tirelessly for national affairs for many years, calling for peaceful unification. This reporter made a special trip to his private residence yesterday to inquire about his views on the current situation. He said: Although the fifteen-day deadline for the ceasefire is approaching, all issues can still be discussed and continued through negotiations. Currently, everyone should be mindful of the suffering of the people and the economic crisis, so that all parties can have the opportunity to reach a peaceful resolution, rather than resorting to armed conflict. Speaking of the Northeast and Southern Shandong incidents, Chu believes that the Northeast issue arose because the government failed to immediately incorporate the local armed forces at the beginning of the takeover, which allowed the CCP to take advantage of it. Most of the 400,000 troops claimed by the CCP in the Northeast were actually puppet troops and underground armed forces such as the Northeast Volunteer Army. If the government had properly dealt with these armed forces in advance, the takeover of the Northeast would not have had so many complications. However, even so, in the future, the Northeast will still have unified administrative power like other provinces and will not be divided in its organization. As for the Southern Shandong incident, I believe that the CCP army would never disregard the feelings of the American army and attack Jinan and Qingdao. When the reporter asked about his opinions on relieving the suffering of the people in the "Soviet-Lu-Wan Border Region" and other CCP "liberated areas," Chu said: In the above-mentioned areas, the displaced people are indeed full of complaints and unable to return to their hometowns. For example, the [original text] policy in the "liberated areas" of northern Jiangsu really makes it impossible for the common people to survive. But based on my speculation, the "Soviet-Lu-Wan" troops of the CCP may be untrained troops, resulting in this. If peace is achieved, no matter what, third-party figures must ask the CCP to make practical changes to the style of the "liberated areas" so that the common people will no longer be displaced. When the National Assembly is convened in the future, I will also faithfully advise the CCP to change its style. Finally, when the reporter asked about his opinions on the nationalization of the military, he said: The fact that the CCP has its own army is a temporary phenomenon. In the future, the CCP must completely give up its armed forces in order to achieve thorough democratic politics. The first step is to reorganize the troops. Both the government and the CCP have armed forces. The second step is to achieve a unified reorganization, and the national army will be completely unified under unified command. The CCP will not have privately owned armed forces. Cooperating with the CCP's proposed "political democratization" proposal and discussing a detailed plan will lead to the successful achievement of the hope of unification and democracy.

### Sichuan Should Organize an Industrial and Mining Inspection Team

[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 20th] Sichuan Province is extremely rich in various mineral deposits. In addition to the Resource Commission's active exploration and mining during the war, the Sichuan Construction Department has recently decided to hire many engineers to form an industrial and mining inspection team to conduct on-site inspections of various famous mining areas within the province, with special emphasis on the exploration of oil and iron deposits. The team requires an appropriation of two million yuan. It will officially depart after the provincial finance department is established in the next fiscal year.

### Distribution of Relief Supplies Has Been Good in the Past; Jiang Tingfu Discusses Transportation Conditions

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] This reporter recently visited Director Jiang of the Executive Headquarters and inquired about the transportation of relief supplies to various places. According to him, from December of last year to May of this year, the distribution of supplies in both the CCP-occupied areas and the National Government areas has been excellent. However, it has been repeatedly obstructed since May. Furthermore, now that foreign ships can sail directly into inland rivers, it is extremely convenient for transporting supplies. He then recounted his efforts to promote shipping because transportation is the most severe problem in our country.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] Regarding the relief to the CCP area in northern Jiangsu, the first batch of 300 tons of flour, old clothes, and medicine was sent by Zhang Renji, a special commissioner of the Su-Ning Branch, to Huaiyin on April 29th to be distributed. According to Zhang's report on May 3rd, the goods had arrived in Huaiyin for distribution, which proves that the relief supplies have entered the CCP area.

### Different Communist Areas; Banks Are Separated

[This Newspaper, Peiping, 19th] Due to the different areas under communist control, the banks in the communist-controlled zones are all independently established. There are independent banks established in eleven areas under the three military systems. The amount of their legal currency issued is recorded as follows: A. New Fourth Army System: (1) Central China Area, i.e., 48 counties in the border area of Jiangsu, Anhui, and Henan. "Central China Bank," headquarters in Huaiyin, issued banknotes called Anti-Japanese Currency, 78.3 billion.

### Editorial: Politicians and Critics

President Song attended two receptions for Chinese and foreign journalists held by the Central Propaganda Department on the afternoon of the 19th, and delivered very clear and humorous remarks. The Q&A between President Song and the journalists has appeared in various newspapers, and generally revolved around finance and economy. President Song said that engaging in politics cannot completely satisfy everyone; this is something we can acknowledge. Regarding the recent criticism from "Time" magazine's article "Bad Government," he believes it is nitpicking; we share some of the same sentiment. President Song also stated that he had previously been too busy with his duties to engage in publicity, but from now on, he is willing to fully answer questions from the outside world at various gatherings; regarding this point, we are particularly pleased.

Having read the special dispatches from reporters in various newspapers, we can vividly imagine President Song's demeanor during the two talks the day before yesterday. Although we did not personally witness his coughs, President Song's words were indeed in his tone. Regardless of the content of his answers, President Song's demeanor this time is worthy of praise. The fundamental spirit of democracy lies in allowing criticism. A politician, bearing the heavy responsibility of the country, his policies, his measures, every move and every word, are all related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. If he sincerely wants to lead the country onto the path of democracy, the politician must make every effort to approach the people and listen to their opinions. Especially news reporters, they are the bridge or megaphone between the people and the government. If a politician is afraid of meeting reporters, avoiding them like the plague, it is like crossing a river without a bridge. If reporters want to find out the truth of the political situation, but cannot easily reach an authority with actual responsibility, then even if they want to transmit the voice of the people, it will inevitably be empty and meaningless. In this case, how can there not be estrangement? This is painful and frustrating for the reporters, but it is also a great loss for the politicians. As long as we often see the stories of the late President Roosevelt of the United States meeting with news reporters, displaying both humor and seriousness, we dare say that a politician's cultivation of his temperament in receiving news reporters is really the basic condition of democratic demeanor. Generally, people often say that President Song has a foreign air and is not easy to approach; however, we believe that as long as he has the temperament of politicians in democratic countries such as Britain and the United States, and can often engage with reporters as frankly and humorously as he did the day before yesterday, it will be of great benefit to China's politics!

President Song believes that the current criticisms from the outside world are sufficient to prove that freedom of speech exists, and that criticism is not surprising. This understanding is very valuable! Democratic politics is politics that can withstand everyone's criticism. The so-called criticizing politics originally contains two aspects of consideration: on the part of the critic, there must be the courage to avoid being sentimental, the sincerity to seek the facts, and at the same time, must strictly adhere to the principles of respecting oneself and respecting the other party. Only in this way can it be called criticizing politics, rather than defaming individuals. In countries with freedom of speech, such as Britain, the big hat of freedom of the press cannot cancel the defamation law, which is due to the strict boundary between criticism and defamation. On the part of the politician, there must be the patience to listen to criticism, the wisdom to explain criticism, and most importantly, there must be ample tolerance for criticism. Politicians should know that the impulse of critics when their emotions are agitated often leads to exaggeration, and it is inevitable that they will engage in personal attacks. Whether politicians have the tolerance is the reason whether the atmosphere of criticizing politics can be cultivated. When President Roosevelt was a local official, once a group of citizens marched and protested, shouting slogans to overthrow him, but he stood on the balcony upstairs to watch their march, dismissing it with a smile, as if nothing had happened. During his presidency, he implemented the New Deal, and he did not know how many people opposed and attacked him before and after, but he absolutely did not blame anyone's criticism and attack, except for announcing his policies and implementing his policies. The greatness of President Roosevelt and the reason why the American government has become a model of democracy are manifested in these places. President Song's recognition that "freedom of speech exists, and criticism is not surprising" should not only be cheered by critics, but also by those who aspire to be politicians, who should be excited that China is indeed gradually embarking on the road to democracy. The temporary success or failure of a politician is a small matter; the success or failure of cultivating a democratic atmosphere in Chinese politics is a major matter. We not only welcome President Song's demeanor, but also hope that all government officials and even civil servants with "a post and a half" have this tolerance, and never repay grievances with grudges, behaving like a petty man.

Finally, we want to take the opportunity to mention our feelings after reading "Time" magazine's "Bad Government" article. "Time" magazine, edited by Luce, is originally an impartial publication in the United States. Its criticism of China's political situation has been able to say a few fair words over the years, and in the eyes of some leftist American reporters, it may even be accused of being right-leaning and protecting the Kuomintang. The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" editorial on the 17th said that "Time" has now leaned to the left! We will leave aside whether "Time" is leaning to the right or to the left for the moment, but there is a sentence in this article in "Time" magazine that is worth our attention and sighing over, namely: "Nothing but a good government can stop the Chinese Communist Party from embarking on the path of revolution!" In fact, how can this not be true for China? Any government, as long as it is indeed good, where will there be revolution again? We certainly do not want China to have another violent revolution after the eight-year war, and we especially do not want to see the Chinese Communist Party hang up a sheep's head and sell dog meat, insisting on having another armed rebellion in China and calling it a communist revolution. However, the best way to prevent this unnecessary revolution is indeed to establish a "good government." "Time" magazine reporters' call may not be very far from the call of the Chinese people. The so-called "good government," in today's China, is extremely simple: first, it must be clean and honest; second, it must be efficient; third, it must have a long-term vision, doing big things for the country and not competing with the people for small profits. "Time's" criticism may be excessive, especially since it only writes about the dark side and does not see the bright side; however, whether today's government has done a perfect job, there must be public opinion both in the government and among the people. Even President Song has publicly said in the Political Consultative Conference and the Central Plenary Session that he himself is not satisfied with the current financial and economic situation, and this time he met with reporters and asked everyone with a smile if they had any good ideas, hoping to propose them for discussion, which shows that he does not shy away from the fact that the current government should strive for further progress to reach the level of a truly "good government." There is no need to be afraid of "Time's" reporters' nitpicking; the most fearful thing is that our officials in charge are unwilling to face this reality squarely. Now that President Song can frankly admit this reality, then as long as he is brave enough to take responsibility, brave enough to reflect, and solicit public opinion, starting from scratch, a "good government" can emerge on the spot. As long as we can make a great determination and first carry out a thorough purge of corruption, the "good government" will have a beginning. "Lay down the butcher knife and become a Buddha on the spot." Establishing a "good government" is just like that. Let's see if our politicians have this courage and this perseverance!

### Current French Foreign Minister Bidault Elected President of the Provisional Government; Communist Party Abstains from Voting; France Takes a Further Step Away from Left-Leaning

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 19th] The National Constituent Assembly met today, and the Provisional President and Prime Minister Gouin gave a speech, praising General de Gaulle highly, to which the members responded with enthusiastic applause. Immediately afterwards, a vote was held to elect the President of the Provisional Government. Georges Bidault, one of the leaders of the Popular Republican Movement, and the current Foreign Minister, was elected with 384 votes (out of a total of 545 votes). Bidault had received the support of the Socialist Party, while the Communist Party abstained, and the Unified Resistance Movement and eleven Christian Democrats also abstained.

[United Press, Paris, 19th] After Foreign Minister Bidault, leader of the Popular Republican Movement, was elected as the President of the Provisional Government of France today, the Socialist Party officially announced that five of their members who originally intended to vote in favor temporarily did not vote and should be counted as voting in favor. Therefore, President Bidault received a total of 389 votes. Previously, Communist Party member Croizat declared that the party was prepared to make considerable concessions on the new constitution, meaning that the party could approve a certain form of House of Representatives in a bicameral parliament, and could also increase the power of the President so that he would not become a puppet. Observers believe that this statement is a prelude to the Communist Party's preparation to compromise and participate in the government. The Socialist Party also expressed its willingness to accept a compromise in accordance with de Gaulle's wishes regarding the bicameral parliament and presidential powers.

[Associated Press, Paris, 19th] After Bidault was elected President of the Provisional Government, France has taken a further step away from left-leaning. His election as president by the Constituent Assembly has paved the way for the formation of a new cabinet. He will serve as Prime Minister concurrently, or another person will be appointed to fill the post. Political observers believe that the development of the situation will be advantageous to adopting the former method.

### A Brief Biography of Bidault

Bidault is a capable new figure. Born in Moulins on October 5, 1899, he is currently 46 years old, the youngest of the four major foreign ministers. He began his military service at the end of the First World War in 1918. After the war, he left the army to continue his studies and participate in the Catholic Youth Movement. With his extraordinary talent, he finally became the leader of the Popular Republican Movement. Later, he served as a history professor at the University of Paris and a journalist. At this time, as a member of the People's Democratic Party, he vigorously promoted his political views in newspapers, and his articles such as "The Annexation of Austria," "The Spanish Civil War," and "The Munich Agreement" were widely circulated. He firmly opposed fascism and Nazism. Among the three left-wing parties in France, he represented the new left.

In 1940, he joined the army and served, but was captured by the enemy in May of the same year. He was released in 1941 as a veteran. After regaining his freedom, he participated in anti-enemy work in southern France and later joined the National Resistance Committee, where he was elected as chairman. He led secret anti-enemy organizations during the French occupation and achieved great success.

Bidault's diplomatic experience is not rich. He took office as French Foreign Minister in September 1944 and accompanied de Gaulle to Moscow to sign the Franco-Soviet Treaty. The important international conferences he has attended include the San Francisco Conference, the London Foreign Ministers' Conference, the First Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference, and the most recent Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference.

### Anti-Communist Demonstration in Paris

[Central News Agency, Paris, 19th dispatch] Anti-Communist demonstrators attacked the headquarters of the French Communist Party in Paris at 1:30 this morning, shouting "De Gaulle should retake power" and "Burn Thorez at the stake" (note: Thorez is the leader of the French Communist Party). The incident occurred after a parade was held on the evening of the second anniversary of the anti-German resistance. The demonstrators broke the doors and windows of the Communist Party headquarters, took away propaganda pamphlets and slogans, and burned them publicly in the streets. The French Ministry of the Interior has launched an investigation into the incident and arrested several people. Today, when Communist Party representatives attended the Constituent Assembly, they issued a public condemnation of the riot. The Paris District Trade Union, led by the Communist Party, has issued a notice asking all workers in Paris to go on strike from 5:00 PM tomorrow and hold a demonstration in front of the Communist Party headquarters to protest this morning's incident.

### Four Foreign Ministers' Conference Discusses Franco-Italian Border Issue; Italian Reparations Issue Temporarily Shelved

[This newspaper's report] London, broadcast on the 20th: The four foreign ministers held two meetings today, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. During the morning meeting, the British and American foreign ministers stated that British and American troops would withdraw from Italy within September and October after the Italian Peace Treaty was signed. The foreign ministers also reviewed the French request to occupy the Franco-Italian border strongholds. The French requested a guarantee against being attacked from behind again. The afternoon meeting will discuss the issue of Italian colonies. [Associated Press, Paris, 19th] The four foreign ministers' conference has encountered difficulties on the issue of Italian reparations and has now avoided discussing it. Today's discussion was limited to the main economic clauses in the draft Italian treaty, and it was agreed to discuss the Franco-Italian border issue tomorrow.

### Soviet Representative Strongly Advocates Maintaining Veto Power

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 19th] After the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission meeting concluded today, Soviet representative Gromyko spoke to reporters about his views, stating that the Security Council should maintain the veto power enjoyed by major powers under all circumstances.

(2) Stop the conflict, with both sides' troops holding their original defenses.

### Soviet Representative Proposes Banning Atomic Weapons; Chinese, British, and Canadian Representatives Support US Plan

[United Press, New York, 19th] Soviet representative Gromyko today proposed to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission the establishment of an international agreement banning the manufacture and use of atomic bombs. It is said that the manufacture of atomic bombs can only have negative consequences for world peace. Scientific inventions cannot become the exclusive domain of one country, and will eventually be obtained by other countries. British representative Cadogan promised that Britain would do its best to fully cooperate in assisting the establishment of an international organization to ban atomic bombs and punish those who violate this international control mechanism. Cadogan warmly welcomed the plan put forward by the United States to the Atomic Energy Commission, saying that the British government fully agreed with the US position that those who violated the international control mechanism "must be immediately given appropriate and effective punishment, and the most valuable weapon to prevent such violators is to make people deeply aware that punishment is inevitable and irresistible." The US proposal was put forward by Baruch last Friday, advocating the establishment of an international control mechanism for atomic energy, and then the United States would destroy its existing atomic bombs and stop manufacturing new bombs. All development of atomic energy would be used to benefit mankind.

### Japanese Militarists Control Domestic Speech, Fabricate the September 18th Incident, Distort Treaties, Launch Aggression Against China: Former Minister of Education Maeda Testifies in Court

[United Press Tokyo, 20th] Maeda Tamon, a former newspaper reporter and Minister of Education in the first post-war cabinet, testified today at the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, stating that Japanese warmongers, in an attempt to justify aggression, regarded Manchuria as a "buffer state to defend against the Soviet Union." Maeda said that in 1928, the militarists launched a propaganda campaign foreshadowing the Mukden Incident of 1931, but he could not recall the details. However, the formation of the Tanaka Cabinet was to adopt a more aggressive policy towards Manchuria. In early 1930, the government began to promote domestically that Manchuria was Japan's "lifeline" and that a stronger policy must be adopted. Initially, there were no clear measures to suppress newspapers opposing this continental policy, and the authorities hoped that newspapers, speakers, and other individuals would support the government's national policy. Subsequently, restrictions on speech in Japan became strict, and the Japanese people became silent as cicadas in winter, afraid to discuss national policy. Japan's propaganda plan had a dual purpose, namely to counter domestic criticism. Various newspapers, publishers, writers, speakers, and virtually all available channels of propaganda, extolled Manchuria as Japan's lifeline, and that Japan must expand its influence in that direction, develop its economy and industry, and make it a buffer state against the Soviet Union. Japanese propaganda further distorted certain treaties, claiming that Japan had the right to control Manchuria. Emotional propaganda was based on the fact that Japanese soldiers had shed blood in Manchuria during the Russo-Japanese War, therefore the Japanese people had the right to control it and enjoy its fruits. Furthermore, two lieutenant colonels visited me, expressing dissatisfaction with my opposition to the Anti-Comintern Pact, and ordering me to change my tune in the future. Although they did not make any actual threats, the clanging of their swords left no room for rebuttal. Assistant Prosecutor Hamerick read several sections from the book "The Path of the Subject," which Maeda said was published by the Ministry of Education in March 1941. The book described the "sacredness of the empire" and the "evil of Western thought," and encouraged the Japanese people to abandon individualistic ideas. The greatest goal of the Emperor's subjects was to serve the nation. The book called the European world a materialistic adventure, and claimed that the British and American armies were attempting to monopolize the world, and that it was necessary to liberate the countries of the Far East from white rule.

### Hongmen Zhigongtang from Major Ports at Home and Abroad Plans to Reorganize into Political Party; Over 50 Representatives Gather in Shanghai

[This Newspaper Report] Over 50 representatives from Hongmen Zhigongtang from major ports at home and abroad have been gathering in Shanghai in recent days to deliberate on various preparatory matters for reorganizing the association into a political party, and to draft relevant charters and regulations. After the party is established, the highest responsible person will be Situ Meitang, "Chairman of the China Hongmen Zhigong Party Headquarters." The person in charge in Shanghai will be Zhao Yu, the current "Director General of the China Zhigong General Hall." It is reported that the party headquarters will be located in the capital.

According to the leaders of the party, their purpose in forming the party is not to seek official positions or wealth, but to unite Hongmen brothers and assist in national reconstruction. They will still adhere to the three traditional tenets of Hongmen, namely: (1) uniting with loyalty, (2) saving the country with sincerity, and (3) eliminating the wicked with chivalry. They firmly stated that they will never be exploited by any party, and that all actions will be premised on the welfare of the people of the country. As for the number of party members, it is said that there may be more than 100,000 in this city alone, but the exact number can only be counted after future registration.

### Focus of Four Banks Joint Office Loans: Securing Foreign Exchange and Materials

Loans Divided into Three Stages: Production, Transportation, and Packaging

[Our Report] It is learned that the recent loan policy of the Shanghai Branch of the Four Banks Joint Office emphasizes securing foreign exchange and materials. Loans in this area can be roughly divided into three stages. The first stage involves loans for production, such as the recent tea loan of 7 billion yuan and the spring silk cocoon loan of 20 billion yuan, to enable the completion of the production and manufacturing of various agricultural products. The second stage involves foreign exchange loans during transportation. For example, tea and silk from the Southeast region and leather, medicinal materials, pig bristles, and tung oil from Sichuan and Hankou need to be provided with convenient foreign exchange loans. This will ensure that rural materials can be continuously transported to cities for export. The third stage involves loans for packaging. For example, once materials have been collected in cities and purchase contracts have been established with foreign merchants, loans or overdrafts will be provided during the packaging of these materials, enabling exporters to pay export taxes and transportation costs. In addition to this, the office's existing loan policies are not immutable. They are adjusted based on price levels, market dynamics, government policies, and general needs. As for loans to industrial and mining enterprises, more loans were issued at the beginning when many factories were resuming operations. Recently, as most factories have already resumed operations, fewer loans have been issued. However, general industrial and commercial loans continue to be processed based on the actual situation.

### Record of Flowers in Dance Halls

After approval by the police bureau, a permit will be issued, which is valid for six months. It is learned that foreign dance hostesses must also register with the police bureau to operate legally. As of yesterday, no foreign dance hostesses had registered with the police bureau. Most of the dance hostesses are between 16 and 22 or 23 years old, while very few are between 30 and 40 years old. Foreign dance hostesses tend to be older. These dance hostesses mainly dance because of financial difficulties. There are very few exceptions.

(The picture shows female police officers in uniform processing the registration procedures for dance hostesses. Photo by China News Agency)

### Counterfeit $50 U.S. Bills Discovered in the Market: Exquisite Printing Makes Identification Difficult

Recently, the number of counterfeit U.S. dollars discovered in the market has been increasing. Yesterday, a reporter visited the U.S. Army Headquarters Crime Investigation Department in Hongkou New Asia Restaurant, where they were received by Captain Marist, the director of the department, and Captain Pullotin, the deputy director. They informed the reporter that the counterfeit bills discovered are all $50 bills. The differences are as follows: 1. Front: There is a "2" in the middle of the "Serial Number" on the right side. The letter "B" in the bank name is particularly large. There are "A4" and other characters on the bottom right and top left. 2. Back: Printed with the number "106". These counterfeit bills are all printed with the words "Printed in 1934". Furthermore, the printing technique is extremely sophisticated, and it is impossible for non-experts to distinguish between genuine and counterfeit bills. The reporter then inquired about what effective measures the U.S. military authorities plan to adopt. They were informed that in addition to issuing an emergency notice, informing all relevant authorities to refuse to accept any suspicious $50 bills, investigators and detectives have been specially selected and dispatched to investigate. Captain Ma emphasized that the rampant counterfeit bills not only affect Shanghai's finances but also damage the credibility of the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank. The authorities will do everything possible to thoroughly investigate.

[Additional News] It is reported that after hearing that the U.S. military authorities are refusing to accept $50 U.S. bills, currency exchange shops have started offering discounts, ranging from 10% to 4%.

### After Further Interrogation by the District Procuratorate: Wang Daren Was Taken Back by the Garrison Command; Wang's Family Was Also Placed Under Surveillance

Ren Xingya Claims He Has Not Committed Any Crimes

[Our Report] Yesterday morning, the District Court Procuratorate interrogated Wang Daren and Ren Xingya, two grain officials, and grain merchant Shao Jigao again at about 10:00 AM. The interrogation ended at about 2:00 PM, and they were taken back to the garrison command for detention. Ren and Shao remained in custody at the District Court Detention Center. Ren had his head shaved and was still wearing a beige Zhongshan suit. His leather belt had been replaced with a plain white belt used by prisoners, and his shoelaces had also been removed. According to his statement to the reporter: (1) The "Grain Goods Regulations" stipulate that anyone with the ability to purchase grain can apply for a loan. As for grain merchants purchasing grain from various places, they are often detained due to the ban on grain exports in various counties, so they usually transport grain once a month. (2) Grain merchants have their own capital in addition to loans, and their stockpiling of grain may be done using their own capital. (3) After the grain arrives, he immediately orders that it not be stored in warehouses but sold to the market as soon as possible to suppress grain prices. As for whether the grain merchants comply, he does not know. Therefore, the so-called corruption and malfeasance have nothing to do with him. If there is any, he requests that it be strictly dealt with. According to Prosecutor Wu's statement to the reporter, both Wang and Ren have good attitudes during the investigation and answered questions clearly. Unless there is unexpected new evidence, the investigation of this case can be concluded before the end of the month, and a decision will be made on whether to file a public prosecution.

Yesterday afternoon, the District Procuratorate sent bailiffs to the Garrison Command to transfer Rong Yongming, but because Commander Xuan and the director of the military law department were both out on official business, the transfer had not been completed by the evening. Wang Xunzhi, the manager of the Yangtze River Company who is in custody, was interrogated again by the military law department yesterday. All the account books of the grain merchants were also closely inspected by the department.

According to inquiries from our reporter, Wang Daren's family has been placed under surveillance by the Garrison Command starting yesterday.

### Traitorous Puppet Regime's Special Agent Bigwig: Pan Da on Trial

A Third Pretentious, Entirely Acting Like a Fool

Claims Mr. Dai Invited Him to Dinner: Judge Qiu Gets Angry and Reprimands Him

[Our Report] Pan Da, a traitorous special agent bigwig of the puppet regime, dominated the western Shanghai area when Shanghai was under enemy occupation, harming the country and the people. His crimes are well-known. Pan is from Guangdong and graduated from Guanghua University. He joined the puppet regime in 1940 and served as the director of the Fourth Division of the Special Agent Headquarters. Later, he also served as the director of the Preparatory Office for the Recovery of the Road Beyond the Settlement of the Puppet Regime, a councilor of the puppet municipal government, the director of the West Shanghai Special Police Headquarters, and the director of the West Shanghai Police Bureau. Yesterday, when he was interrogated by the High Court, Pan was wearing a lotus-colored long gown, still with a third of false politeness. He completely denied the crimes alleged by the prosecutor, such as using the power of the enemy puppet regime to oppress the people. When asked about the internal organization of No. 76, Pan hesitated and avoided giving a direct answer. Judge Qiu became very angry and rebuked him for pretending to be a fool and trying to evade responsibility. He also asked why he had seized the house at No. 40 Cisfell Road owned by the Tao family. Pan claimed that the house was rented from Pan Sansheng, and he paid a monthly rent of 1,000 yuan for a total of two months. He cunningly claimed that he was a third-level tenant, not a second-level landlord, so how could he have seized the house? The court also asked about the bombing case in Zhaofeng Park and rebuked his special police headquarters for using this major event to frame underground workers. Pan defended that the Special Agent Headquarters was for suppressing opium, gambling, and correcting bad local customs. Judge Qiu also asked whether he had colluded with the traitor Wu Shibaobao during his tenure as the district chief of the Fourth District to harm young people and kill compatriots. Pan also denied this in every possible way. He also claimed: "Because I knew that I was doing a bad job, I deeply regretted it, so after 1943, I participated in underground work and contacted the central government. On September 20th of last year, Mr. Dai Li even invited me to dinner. Who knew that he would arrest me after the meal." Judge Qiu immediately rebuked him: "You are really powerful. Even Mr. Dai Li had to invite you to dinner to arrest you. Your skills are really not small!" After further detailed questioning, he was ordered to be detained and the interrogation was postponed.

Also, Qu Bin, the head of the General Affairs Section of the puppet China Electric Company, Zhou Wenrui, the chairman of the board of the puppet Racecourse Sports School, Qian Xiaomin, the acting director of the Information Section of the Wuxi Station of the Second Bureau of the puppet Political Security Department in the Southern Jiangsu District, and Huang Qinwen and Hong Wenjiang, who manipulated the sale of fresh pork in the Northern Jiangsu Company, harming merchants and people, were also interrogated and their cases were postponed.

### Hongkou Swimming Pool to Open in Early Next Month

The Hongkou Dangtian Swimming Pool is now one of the branches of the Shanghai Municipal Sports Field. It was never repaired during the enemy puppet regime, and the interior has been severely damaged, especially the machine room filtration system. If it is not renovated, the pool water will inevitably become turbid, which would not only reduce swimmers' interest, but also affect hygiene. In addition, the entire building leaks almost everywhere, and the showerheads and electrical wiring are also incomplete. Repairs will take a considerable amount of time. The Bureau of Public Works engineers estimated that repairs would cost 30 million yuan. After Jiang Xiangqing, director of the sports field, took over the pool, he immediately began work. The repair costs were agreed upon with the responsible leaders and will be borne by the sports field itself. It is scheduled to open in early next month.

### Fireflies

— Shi Bei

In the countryside at night, it's now the time to lightly fan and chase fireflies, but living in the heart of this big city, it's not easy to see those summer night messengers like little stars.

Because of the muggy weather, he took a milky green palace fan and went to the balcony to cool off. He lay quietly, letting his mind wander infinitely; he didn't look at the neon lights of the city around him, or the dazzling electric lights. Lying face up, he looked at the sparse little stars in the distant sky; gradually, a wisp of thin memories enveloped his vision: he saw a line of firefly light bands, and remembered the firefly he had lost contact with.

Firefly was a slender, fair-skinned girl with a personality that was outwardly gentle but inwardly strong, who often loved to write lyrical and delicate short poems; she said that she had liked firefly light since she was a child, so in all her finished poems, she wrote the pen name "Firefly," and others called her Firefly.

Four years ago, he was living in the countryside not far from the city to recuperate from an illness. Firefly moved from the city to the countryside with a relative's family. It was summer vacation at that time, and he was living a very quiet and comfortable life, doing nothing but reading a few books, and no one came to bother him, so his illness gradually improved.

Once, by chance, he met Firefly, perhaps because they lived only across a garden from each other. It turned out that they were classmates in the same school, so on the basis of school friendship, they soon got rid of their unfamiliarity.

The hot and long days of summer slowly passed, and the twilight hours were also very long; the evening glow hung on the treetops in the garden, as if reluctant to leave, not moving for a long time. At this time, only wisps of rising smoke from evening cooking drifted from the roofs of the country houses, and some tired birds flew back to their nests; all of this, like monotonous and soft lines, painted a beautiful picture of the evening scenery of rural life; it gave people a feeling of tranquility and seclusion, and at the same time, a sense of peace in solitude. It was at such times that he often met Firefly in the garden behind the house, and they would walk around the garden together, or sit under the trees and chat; their feelings for each other grew with each passing day, and they could confide in each other without restraint.

The black night in the countryside was like being immersed in a layer of cool silk; he and Firefly sat on the stone slab away from the trees. Under the fence of the garden, several fireflies flew around, flashing their light, probing the mysteries of the dark night; crisscrossing back and forth, without a moment's rest, their eyes followed the firefly light. At first, they were silent, as if facing the firefly light, each had endless thoughts waiting to be poured out.

"Do you love this firefly light?" Finally, she tilted her head and slowly began to ask him.

"I'm not very interested in these." He replied casually, but then immediately said, "Oh, I remember, your pen name is Firefly, that's not bad." After he finished the last sentence, he felt a little confused.

"Don't associate the firefly light with my messy pen name, I'm just asking if you like firefly light?" She was a little embarrassed and felt shy.

"Isn't firefly light too weak? It has no power in the world."

"Although it is such a small thing, it is not afraid of darkness, nor is it afraid of the raging night in a storm; it wants to fly, it wants to emit light; even if it is trampled to death by others, its light still remains on its corpse," she said a little hastily, and stopped speaking because of a slight cough.

"But you have to be careful of its destruction!" He said quietly.

"No, it has courage - this also symbolizes life."

"The roads in the world are full of bumps and twists! The road that humans walk will not be as free as the fireflies traveling in the boundless night!" His voice was like the morbid tone of a sick person.

"The darkness of the night is like the bumps and twists in the world, so terrible and sinister, and isn't the real society a mass of darkness? In the vast universe, humans are like fireflies, they want to bring light to the world, even if it is a pitiful little bit, it is still their task!"

"That's a fact, but fantasies are mostly perfect and lovely, like a bird with incomplete feathers, before it leaves the nest to learn to fly, relying on the ready-made nurture of its mother, hiding in a comfortable nest, it thinks about its ambitions, thinking about how beautiful and high the outside blue sky is, but when it leaves the nest, it will be different." He seemed to be deliberately making things difficult for her.

"So, are you saying that I don't have courage?"

"No!"

"Then are you afraid, afraid of real life?"

"Not necessarily." In fact, her questioning had unintentionally touched his heart, and his timidity in front of girls.

"You are tired..." She continued to question, she originally wanted to say you are tired of life, but after saying the word tired, she suddenly stopped.

He didn't answer for a long time, and then he shook his head as if he was tired.

That night, although it was a faint half-moon, the moonlight could shine on them through the gaps in the leaves, and their faces could be seen clearly. But he didn't look at her, and after shaking his head to her question, he slowly sank his head into his hands on his knees. Suddenly he stood up, staring blankly at the dark corner of the house.

She also stood up, walked to his side and said:

"Not feeling well?"

He shook his head, still silent.

"It's late, don't catch a cold anymore, go back to sleep, I'm going back too." She pulled his hand and walked out of the garden.

He looked at her back, and saw the distant fireflies, carrying a brighter light than usual, flying higher and higher, and after a moment, he went into the house.

A month passed quickly, and every evening, they often walked in the garden and sat under the trees to cool off. His illness had recovered, but unfortunately at that time, the war in the south suddenly became tense, and everyone was planning to flee, preparing to leave this village and go to another place.

He stayed in the city for a week to take care of some things before returning to the countryside, and then he knew that Firefly had already left here with her relatives. After he returned home, the servant gave him a letter, which was written to him by Firefly; he opened it and saw that it was just a blank piece of paper, with a short poem entitled "Firefly" written on it, with Firefly's name signed under the title. The poem was written like this:

What is lost?

In this lightly cold night,

You still light your faint light alone

Searching back and forth.

Wanting to compete with the stars for brilliance?

The stars are sparkling all night long,

But you

Are just a fleeting glimmer;

Firefly!

When you come and go by my ears,

Are you telling me:

"Even if life is like a昙花,

My own road

Is still lit by myself?"

The next day, he also left the countryside in a panic, because everyone was wandering in turmoil, so after a few years of separation, in addition to living a precarious life, he could no longer get any news of Firefly.

Now he is wandering in this noisy city near the coast, the temptation of the night, and the music of the radio blowing in the cool wind, he seems to have not heard any of these, he is immersed in the quiet and silent summer night in the countryside.

Tonight it is late, but he still did not go downstairs, staring blankly at the small stars in the distant sky; he thought that these stars are like the firefly light that Firefly said!

Firefly, firefly light, life, he thought about it in a series of thoughts.

6, 10, late at night

Herding horses return, desolate smoke carved.

### Whispers Under the Moon

— Zhang Che

No

Don't put on clothes

Do you know

The coldness of the night

Has a desolate sweetness

Come

But be gentle

Do you know

Under the moon

There is more sorrow

### Mother

— Zhong Yuan

Mother was a beautiful woman. She had a delicate face, soft black hair, and a pair of exquisite small hands. She often wore light gray dresses, wandering under the wintersweet trees, holding me in her right arm, and holding my older sister's hand in her left hand, gently saying:

"Baby, Amitabha, Mommy's darling, Mommy's treasure! Mommy is so distressed, you must always listen to Mommy, oh!..."

Mother's voice was like a clear spring in the deep mountains, gurgling down from infinite heights, and mother's love also flowed down from infinite heights, but she was on the bed, panting, groaning, pain and fatigue trapped her whole body. However, a light breeze blew outside the window, and she immediately struggled to sit up, stretched out a withered hand, touched me, touched my older sister, and a string of tears dripped down:

"Poor children! It's so cold, the cotton-padded coats haven't been made yet. I don't know when Mommy's illness will get better, when can I make cotton-padded coats for you!..."

Mother's tears were crystal bright pearls, illuminating my childish and ignorant heart, illuminating my ignorant and ignorant soul. Like a tamed little lamb, I prostrated myself in front of my mother's bed, pressing my mother's feverish and thin face with my small palms, silently blessing: "May Mommy's illness get better soon! May Mommy make new cotton-padded coats for us!"

However, Mother finally left me!

Even, my older sister also left me!

For many, many years, like a small duckweed, I have been drifting alone in the vast world!..."

For many, many years, in the cold world, I have been yearning for my mother, yearning for my mother's love!..."

Mother! When will I be able to return to my distant hometown, prostrate myself in front of your grave, press the weeds on your tomb with my thin palms, and call you softly again "Mommy"?

### Double Flying (60)

— Zhao Qingge

"Alas! What 'reason' can be spoken of?" Little Red sighed deeply.

The water was hot, Little Red stood up and filled a basin, sat down in the corner of the room to take off her socks. But her feet were already swollen from the cold, no matter how hard she tried, the socks would not come off. Helpless, she asked Bao Ling to bring her a pair of scissors, and only then could she barely cut the socks open, her two feet as red as if they had been dyed.

"Does it hurt?" Bao Ling asked with concern.

"No." Little Red shook her head with a frown. "It just feels swollen and uncomfortable!"

Just then, the landlady arrived in the kitchen like a whirlwind, and when she saw Bao Ling squatting beside Little Red, Little Red sitting in front of a steaming basin of water, looking very intimate. This time, the landlady caught a handle, and shouted loudly:

"What are you doing?"

"Little Red just came back from collecting firewood, her feet were frozen, preparing to wash them with hot water. I'll cook for her." Bao Ling said, stood up, and put the rice into the pot. In her heart, she was really annoyed by the landlady's insulting tone, but she didn't want to argue with her.

Little Red was asked by the landlady to be extremely embarrassed, lowered her head, her face red. At the same time, she was also trembling with fear, which was even more uncomfortable than the cold! She was more afraid of the landlady than she was of the severe cold!

"Is this the firewood you collected today?" The landlady kicked the bundle of wet firewood with her foot disdainfully and said: "Why did you come back so late, what did you do?"

"It was snowing, I couldn't see the firewood, I barely used a flat bar to pry off the snow to collect this little bit. Really, Mommy! I didn't slack off for a moment." Little Red said in a low voice. She was shouting injustice in her heart!

"Hmph, I see you! You're also growing up, thinking big, thinking of playing some crooked tricks, aren't you? Really a natural cheap货, you can't even stick to the wall, and you've only been a child bride for a few days? You're already eager to find a man?" The landlady scolded, while maliciously glancing at Bao Ling and Little Red.

"No, Mommy! I didn't!" Little Red cried out aggrievedly.

"Landlady!" Bao Ling walked towards the landlady with a stern face. He understood what she meant, and he was so angry that he wanted to beat the fat woman.

But the landlady didn't wait for Bao Ling to speak, but shouted sharply:

"This is none of your business, aren't you going to the store?" After saying that, she walked out of the kitchen, glared fiercely at Little Red, and muttered: "Shameless little prostitute, you're already trying to seduce men at such a young age!"

Bao Ling saw the landlady leave, and muttered in a low voice:

"Old undead hag!"

Little Red was so angry that she couldn't speak, and after a while, she said to Bao Ling:

"Brother Bao Ling, you should go to the front! Don't let me cause you to suffer injustice."

"It's okay, I'm not afraid of her! You just wash your feet, I'll leave after I finish cooking." Bao Ling said and went to the stove again.

Little Red sighed, wiped her tears, touched the water in the basin, it was still very hot, so she put her feet in, suddenly, she felt a piercing pain, as if her whole body was about to fall apart, she screamed, and then suddenly fell down.

"Ah!"

### Registered Rice and Grain Distributed as Much as Possible, Rice Shops Not Allowed to Stop Selling Without Permission, Otherwise It Will Be Considered Disrupting the Market

Since the municipal authorities have made every effort to suppress the price of rice and grain, the rice market has not fluctuated much in the past two weeks, but the amount of transactions has been abnormally light. Recently, however, retail rice shops throughout the city have restricted the quantity of door-to-door sales. Yesterday, rice shops in the Shanghai West District publicly stopped door-to-door sales, and the general public felt even more uneasy. According to the rice industry, the reason for the suspension of retail by retail rice shops is the difficulty in purchasing goods. It is heard that the authorities have decided to continue to distribute the registered stored rice to rice shops as much as possible to meet the needs of retail sales. If there is any suspension of business, it will be investigated and dealt with according to law for disrupting the market. Yesterday, the registration of rice arriving in the city included eight types such as white japonica, totaling more than 2,000 piculs. The types and number of piculs are as follows: White japonica 870 piculs, thin rice 194 piculs, sheep indica 215 piculs, Wuxi indica 94 piculs, white yuan 65 piculs, milled indica 320 piculs, coarse white japonica 100 piculs, coarse Wuxi indica 184 piculs.

### Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Cakes Mostly Weak and Falling

Flour has not gained or lost much, soybeans have been arriving continuously, and the trend is softening. The oil market has seen a surge in supply, falling by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Broad beans have been arriving from all directions one after another, sales are sluggish, falling by another 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Raw kernels are dull and falling by 1,000 yuan. Wheat is moving but not prosperous in Ningbo, and the market is stable. Red beans continue to fall slightly by 1,000 yuan. Bean cake is normal in rural sales, and remains in a mediocre trend.

### Enemy and Puppet Grain Uniformly Distributed

The uses of the enemy and puppet grain received by the Ministry of Food, whether to supply military rations or to sell for civilian consumption, are determined according to the actual situation of each place, so as to allocate and use them appropriately. The sales portion is handled jointly with the Bureau of Enemy and Puppet Property. The proceeds from the sale are deposited into the special account of the Bureau in the Central Bank at any time. As for the portion allocated for military rations, because the price of military rations is lower, and most of them are first allocated by local troops or stations, in fact, it is impossible to pay the money at the market price at any time and place in accordance with the regulations of the Bureau. Now, in order to take into account both the law and the facts, the Ministry has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan for approval. All received grain (including raw materials and finished products in factories), except for those approved for auction, should be handled jointly with the Bureau, and the proceeds should be turned over to the Bureau at any time for remittance to the national treasury. As for the portion of military rations that have been allocated and reserved for allocation, they should also be settled at the market price at the time of receipt and transferred from the treasury. In addition, the grain directly received and allocated by various troops or stations should be investigated by the Ministry of Military Administration and notified to the Ministry of Food for deduction within the approved military ration quota, and the transfer procedures should still be handled in accordance with the above regulations.

### Silk Factories Cannot Start Work, High Costs Make Export Difficult

The spring cocoon season has passed, but there are still very few silk factories starting work. According to people in the silk cocoon industry, the reason why silk factories are delayed in starting work is that Japanese raw silk is currently being dumped at low prices, which affects the export market of our country's raw silk. The main reason is the soaring prices. In the past, wages accounted for only 5% of the production cost, but now they account for 20%. Now, based on the calculation of 200 cars starting, more than one million yuan will be lost every day. Silk manufacturers are all watching and waiting at this point. According to people in the silk factory industry, the silk industry has now reached the most important juncture. They urgently hope that the government can purchase raw silk at a reasonable price, allocate fuel at a flat price, and reduce loan interest rates. It is still possible to save the industry in the event of an emergency. If the silk industry receives the above assistance, then all of them will reluctantly start work.

### Is There Also Embezzlement of Cocoon Loans? The Management Office Sends Personnel to Conduct Detailed Investigations in Various Places

The Jiangsu Provincial Cocoon Loan Management Office has recently heard that some silk manufacturers have transferred loans for other purposes. It is sending personnel to conduct detailed investigations in various places. If any are found, they will be severely punished to prevent malpractices. In addition, since the spring cocoon market has all ended, and there are still many loan procedures that have not been completed, the office has formulated measures to inform all loan manufacturers to comply with them. (1) The expenses of each loan factory shall not exceed 30% of the purchase price of fresh cocoons, and the loans received shall never be transferred for other purposes. (2) All the remaining funds shall be returned to the management office for verification and then returned to the loan bank. (3) The dry cocoons received by each manufacturer shall be stored in the Farmers Bank warehouse designated by the manufacturer. If the silk manufacturer needs to store the cocoons freely, the management office shall send personnel to the factory for supervision. (4) When the loan manufacturer stores dry cocoons in a private warehouse, the warehouse receipt shall be handed over to the management office for safekeeping.

### Caustic Soda Continues to Fall, Modern Enterprises Sell at High Prices

According to people in the industry, recently Hong Kong will ship about 1,000 barrels of caustic soda to Shanghai, and a certain foreign firm may also allocate goods at the end of the month, so that many people are selling spot goods at high prices, and they have continued to fall by more than 100,000 yuan in recent days. Caustic potash and vaseline have arrived at the port.

### Disputes Over Warehouse Receipts for Lun Chang Printed Cloth

Remaining goods successively discovered in various warehouses, customers and manufacturers compete to demand extraction

[Reported by this newspaper] The various printed cloths produced by the British Lun Chang Factory have been selling for a long time. During the period of the fall, the factory's stored goods were seized by the enemy and puppets. After the victory, the seized goods that were not taken away by the enemy and puppets have continued to be discovered in various warehouses. The people holding the receipts for the goods have requested the Cotton Cloth Association to forward them to the factory for negotiation and extraction, and have submitted them to the Bureau of Enemy and Puppet Property of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui for approval. According to news from the Cotton Cloth Association, the receipts for the goods registered in the association amount to more than 2,600 pieces, and the number of pieces contained in each piece ranges from 20 pieces to 60 pieces, and the total number of pieces should be around 100,000 pieces. As of the latest date, the Lun Chang goods that have been discovered in various warehouses have reached more than 36,000 pieces. The goods that were forcibly purchased by the puppet merchant Tonghui from cotton cloth merchants and are still stored in various warehouses have also been discovered in tens of thousands of pieces, but the Bureau of Enemy and Puppet Property has not approved their return, and even the Lun Chang Factory has no right to take them back. The Cotton Cloth Association is still discussing other methods for this. As for the above-mentioned 36,000 pieces of stored goods, the factory claimed that the factory also had 4,000 pieces of stored goods at that time, which were seized by the enemy and puppets together, and advocated proportional sharing with the customer goods. The association required the receipt holders to extract the goods first, and the two sides have not yet agreed on a method. According to news from the receipt holders, the reason why the customer goods could not be extracted at that time was not due to the negligence of the customers. Now that the stored goods have been discovered, the receipt holders should extract them from the factory. They also claimed that the factory had already disposed of a part of the stored goods without authorization, which was actually damaging the rights and interests of the receipt holders. The customers will collect evidence and reason with them. (Peng)

### Glutinous Rice Twigs Rebound Tightly

### Taiwan's Transition Period, Large Loss of Stored Sugar, Valued at Approximately 300 Billion, Authorities Are Thoroughly Investigating

[Reported by this newspaper] According to extremely relevant sources in the sugar industry of this province, the total amount of sugar stored in Taiwan last year was 840,000 metric tons, of which approximately 330,000 metric tons were destroyed by bombing, leaving 520,000 metric tons. The amount of stored sugar gradually decreased thereafter. When the Taiwan Advanced Command Post was established before Japan surrendered, the amount of stored sugar was 300,000 metric tons. During the period when the Bureau of Industry and Mining took over, there were only 150,000 metric tons remaining. The price of sugar is one million 法幣 per metric ton. At 520,000 metric tons, the value is 520 billion 法幣. At 150,000 metric tons, the value is only 150 billion 法幣. The huge loss of stored sugar is staggering. Relevant authorities are currently conducting a thorough investigation. (Muyun)

### Unequal Hardships and Joys in Cotton Yarn, Product Manufacturing Becomes Even More Difficult

[Our Newspaper's Report] Industry associations in this city, including the dyeing industry, underwear industry, knitting industry, handkerchief industry, hand-woven cotton fabric industry, and towel and blanket industry, all share concerns about the difficulty of sustaining manufacturing due to the soaring price of yarn. They have gathered repeatedly to discuss ways to salvage the situation, believing that yarn mills' profits are excessively high. For the sake of the common survival of industry and the stability of society and people's livelihood, they aim to suppress yarn prices to reduce the cost of manufactured goods. It is reported that they have prepared a document to petition the Ministry of Economic Affairs for effective measures. According to sources in the yarn mill industry, the recent arrival of foreign cotton raw material has been weak, but most factories have sufficient raw cotton reserves for several months, and those with thicker reserves can use them for eight or nine months. As a result, the price of American cotton in the Shanghai market, calculated at the exchange rate, has fallen to nearly the same level as in the New York market. Moreover, all yarn spindles in yarn mills, except for the Textile Construction Company, are almost fully operational. Therefore, it is questionable whether a large amount of cotton raw material needs to be imported in the future. Although India has restricted cotton exports, it has no impact on the supply of raw materials to yarn mills here. However, currently, yarn mills are accustomed to using foreign cotton, and domestic cotton is rarely inquired about. According to people in the cotton raw material industry, each harvest of our country's cotton fields can yield three loads of seed cotton, with each load currently priced at 30,000 yuan, totaling around 90,000 yuan, which is equivalent to the current price of one load of foreign cotton (three loads of seed cotton can also be ginned into one load of lint cotton). The cost for cotton farmers, including seeds, fertilizer, and labor, is at least 100,000 yuan per mu per harvest. Amidst the rising prices of food, cotton farmers are switching to other crops. In the future, domestic cotton production will obviously decrease due to the pressure from foreign cotton. If this is the case, in the cotton industry, apart from yarn mills exclusively obtaining high profits, cotton farmers and cotton product manufacturers will both be unable to stand their ground. According to informed sources in the yarn mill industry, the rise in yarn prices is not due to the yarn mills' intentional raising of prices, but rather due to supply not meeting demand, and the Textile Construction Company's need to maintain its profits to supplement national finances. If there are appropriate measures, yarn mills are very willing to lower their selling prices. According to sources in the cotton yarn and cloth merchant industry, overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia are very eager to purchase domestic goods. Lian Jun, Chairman of the Singapore Chamber of Commerce, and other prominent overseas Chinese figures have petitioned the central government to open up the export of cotton products, because the current import and export trade regulations still include cotton yarn and cotton cloth in the list of prohibited export items in Schedule C. Regarding this point, the Municipal Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association has met with Lian Jun and others several times, and has jointly petitioned the government with the yarn and cloth commercial associations and various cotton manufacturing industry associations to open up exports to Southeast Asia, in response to the requests of overseas Chinese. A proposal has also been put forward in this year's Chamber of Commerce members' congress, and it is said that the Chamber of Commerce is quite sympathetic to it. (Peng)

### Rosin Scarce and Prices Rise

Rosin prices cannot be suppressed at the production site, and transportation costs are also higher than other goods because it is classified as a dangerous item during shipment. 客帮 (traveling merchants/peddlers) who transport it to Shanghai for sale have repeatedly had their prices cut by merchants, so recent arrivals have been quite scarce, and prices have slightly increased, with the market price per standard unit rising from 20,000 yuan to 22,000-23,000 yuan.

### Import of American Timber

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Montmagny Lock, managed by the Fook Lai Company, imported over 2,500 tons of timber from America yesterday. It is currently docked at buoys 38 and 39 for unloading.

Another report, the British ships Hosang and Hanyang will sail to Tianjin today, both carrying general merchandise. The Hosang is carrying over 27,000 bags of relief flour, and 400 bales of cotton. The Hanyang is carrying 56 pieces of automobiles for the Relief Administration.

### Taiwan Company Raises Prices, Sugar Market Continues to Rise

Yesterday, the Sugar Market Association held a pricing session. The morning started calmly, with 20 medium white sugar priced at 96,000 yuan, slightly lower than the previous day by 2,000-3,000 yuan. Later, rumors spread that the company would hold another sales session, so people waited patiently. When the company's staff arrived at the association and saw the price set at 96,000 yuan, they set an opening price of 98,000 yuan. Most in the trade were dissatisfied, with some offering 90,000 yuan, but in the end, a deal was reached at 98,000 yuan. However, the more formal firms largely did not participate, so only over 3,000 bags were traded. There were complaints in the market, with someone writing on the association's blackboard "Only Profit Matters" followed by the name of a certain company with two crosses (XX company). After this fluctuation, the market revived and went upward. Number 20 medium white sugar was priced at 100,000 yuan for double bags and 100,345 yuan for single bags, closing up 4,000 yuan. Fourth period warehouse receipts for number 20 were 100,300 yuan and number 22 were 100,400 yuan, a rise of 6,000 yuan. Brand goods also followed suit with price increases, with brand white opening at 115,000 yuan, followed by 112,000 yuan to 108,000-109,000 yuan, brand red at 96,000 yuan to 99,000 yuan. Over 300 baskets of Diao Qing were priced at 80,000 yuan due to the scarcity of Shantou Qing, which had been transferred to Tianjin. Traders offered 82,000 yuan, and the brand side later raised the price by another 2,000-3,000 yuan.

### Chongqing Branch of the Joint Treasury Determines Measures for Verifying and Exchanging US Dollar Savings Certificates or Drafts

Regarding the procedures for verifying and exchanging US dollar savings certificates, the Chongqing branch of the Joint Treasury has held multiple meetings to discuss and synthesize opinions from all parties, and has formulated "Measures for Verifying and Exchanging US Dollar Savings Certificates or Drafts," which have been sent to all branches for consistent implementation. The details are as follows: (1) When applying for payment, the certificate holder or draft holder must find a reputable business to fill out a surety bond in duplicate, guaranteeing that there is no enemy or puppet relationship, and after verification, payment will be made. (2) If the certificate holder entrusts a bank to handle the verification of certificates in other locations, they must fill out an application form for entrusting the bank to handle the verification of certificates. (3) If the certificate holder needs to exchange for national currency, after verification that there is no enemy or puppet suspicion, regardless of the amount, they do not need to apply for approval from the Central Bank before processing. (4) If the certificate holder needs to designate a bank to apply for foreign exchange to offset positions or use it for compliant purposes, in addition to filling out application form CBC28, they must also fill out application form CBbba or bbca and submit it to the Central Bank for approval. (5) After the accepting bank redeems the US dollar savings certificate and verifies that it is correct, it will issue a draft payable to "Central Bank for the Account of Bank X". This draft can only be entrusted to the Shanghai head office for transfer based on the regulation "designated banks are temporarily limited to Shanghai". When other designated banks in the local area request it, it should be entrusted to the Shanghai branches for transfer. If it cannot issue a draft, the back of the certificate should be stamped with the words "Certificate of genuineness and no loss reported, and has been transferred to the account of Bank X" and a note. (6) The accepting bank should issue a temporary receipt to the customer and must not return the stamped savings certificate to the certificate holder to prevent it from circulating on the market again. (7) The accepting bank redeems US dollar savings certificates (and must stamp the certificate with the phrase "Void if picked up by someone else after transfer by Bank X"). (8) US dollar savings certificate drafts (referring to those that have already been issued) may be purchased and endorsed by the original issuing bank or designated bank (the endorsement procedure is the same as for checks), and then sent to the Central Bank for collection on its behalf. After collection, the account of the designated bank will be collected. (9) When each branch redeems US dollar savings certificates or drafts, the redeeming branch is responsible for verifying whether the certificate has any enemy or puppet suspicion. (10) Certificate holders applying for the issuance of drafts payable to designated banks other than the original issuing bank should request the designated bank to handle it on their behalf.

### Having Typhoid Twice

— Zhang Changhao

I have had typhoid fever twice.

Typhoid fever is said to have lifelong immunity. Once a person has had typhoid fever, they usually don't get it a second time. Of course, there are exceptions. I am not necessarily an exception.

My first case of typhoid fever was confirmed by bacteriological examination. The second time was a mysterious long-term fever that went through all possible examinations, but no pathogen was found, so it was never diagnosed as any specific disease from beginning to end. However, according to hospital rules, any fever of unknown origin is often treated as typhoid fever. Therefore, I was treated as a typhoid fever patient twice.

Speaking of the treatment of typhoid fever, it is really pitiful. Even now, there are no specific drugs or effective treatments for typhoid fever. Typhoid fever patients lie in bed, constantly having a fever, until the body develops sufficient immunity to defeat the bacteria and stop the fever. To this day, there is no drug that can truly shorten the course of typhoid fever. So being a typhoid fever patient requires patience, patience, and the third thing is still patience.

But not having a specific drug doesn't mean that treatment is useless. On the contrary, because there is no specific drug, treatment is especially important. The main purpose of treatment is to maintain the patient's physical strength, so that he can win the final victory in the long battle against bacteria, and so that he doesn't "die before he succeeds" due to lack of physical strength before winning the final victory, or develop any dangerous complications and die.

Diet is the most important part of treatment, because diet is related to both cultivating physical strength and preventing dangerous complications. I have been a typhoid fever patient twice, and I have gained experience in this area twice.

The main symptoms of typhoid fever are fever and intestinal ulcers. Fever consumes a lot of nutrients in the body, so in order to make up for this extra consumption, the diet must be very nutritious, especially increasing the supply of energy-providing nutrients. Intestinal ulcers cannot tolerate rough food, because rough food can stimulate intestinal movement and increase the risk of intestinal bleeding and intestinal perforation.

Thirty or forty years ago, European and American countries uniformly adopted milk diets for typhoid fever patients, because everyone recognized that milk is nutritious and easy to digest, but in 1909, two American doctors analyzed and studied the course of many typhoid fever patients and found that milk diets had many shortcomings and did not meet the two necessary conditions for the diet of typhoid fever patients. First, the nutritional value of milk is indeed very good, but more than 90% is water, which can provide very little energy, so no matter how many pounds you drink, it is not enough to supplement the consumption of nutrients in the body. Patients treated in this way all became skin and bones when they got better, emaciated and不堪 (unable to bear), and had to undergo a long period of recuperation to recover. Second, although milk is easy to digest, drinking too much can easily form small lumps in the stomach, which cannot be completely digested in the intestine, thus not only stimulating the intestinal tract, but also producing gas and causing the intestinal tract to swell, increasing the risk of intestinal bleeding and intestinal perforation. Therefore, they advocated an easily digestible mixed diet, in addition to milk foods, adding various starch and fat foods to increase the supply of energy. Since adopting this mixed diet, typhoid fever patients can maintain their weight without any reduction after having a fever for about a month, and the dangerous complications have also been reduced.

Twenty-two years ago, I had typhoid fever for the first time, and at that time I was already a medical student. However, the internist who had just returned from Germany did not know about this mixed diet method. He prescribed me a milk diet, milk, milk, milk all day long. My appetite was already poor, and this made it even worse. In the end, I frowned when I saw milk. My stomach was also very bloated and uncomfortable. Fortunately, I was lucky and nothing went wrong. But when the fever subsided, I was as thin as a monkey, and it took a long time to recover.

The second time I had typhoid fever, I had already graduated from medical school, and the mixed diet was also the prescribed typhoid fever diet in the ward. My wife took care of my diet in the ward herself. Milk, eggs, noodles, toast, butter, beef, etc. were eaten six times a day. Because the taste was varied, I could barely eat each meal. Although this time I had a fever for more than three months, three times longer than the first fever, my weight did not change significantly when I got better. My family, who knew about my first typhoid fever, saw my condition when I was discharged from the hospital this time and simply saw it as a miracle.

### Diagnosis of the Cause of Typhoid Fever

— Lin Zhaoqi

Typhoid fever is also known as enteric fever. The term "enteric fever" seems inappropriate because the invasion and pathological changes of typhoid bacilli are not limited to the intestinal tract. Although the changes in the intestinal tract are the most significant, and they cause serious complications such as intestinal perforation, intestinal bleeding, and bloating.

Typhoid bacilli enter the intestinal tract through food and drink, invade the circulatory system through the thoracic duct, and then are distributed throughout the body via the blood, especially the reticuloendothelial system—such as bone marrow, solitary and aggregated lymph nodes of the intestines, mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen, and liver. In each of the above places, a life-and-death battle unfolds between the typhoid bacilli and the body's resistance. On one hand, it is the reproduction and growth of the bacilli, and on the other hand, it is the phagocytosis and destruction by reticuloendothelial cells. The outcome of the battle determines the patient's fate.

Diagnosis can be divided into "etiological diagnosis," "anatomical diagnosis," "pathological diagnosis," "physiological diagnosis," etc. In bacterial infectious diseases, "etiological diagnosis" is the most important. No matter how typical the symptoms and signs are, if typhoid bacilli cannot be found, the diagnosis is still incomplete. Conversely, if typhoid bacilli are cultured from bone marrow, blood, or stool, regardless of how confusing the symptoms and signs may be, the diagnosis is as solid as a rock.

To seek the "etiological diagnosis" of typhoid fever, two types of chemical tests can be used: (1) Directly find the causative bacilli in the body, such as bacterial cultures of bone marrow, blood, bile, intestinal contents, stool, and urine; (2) Indirectly use serology to search for agglutinins produced by systemic typhoid bacillus infection, the so-called Widal reaction.

Using bone marrow culture to find typhoid bacilli is a new method in the past six years. Some doctors and patients are still unfamiliar with this method. In fact, extracting bone marrow from the sternum with a Sahli's needle for culture is a simple, easy, and harmless diagnostic procedure. It is no more painful for the patient than venipuncture. The advantages of bone marrow culture are briefly described as follows: (1) It is much easier to culture typhoid bacilli from bone marrow than from blood; and whether it is in the early or late stages of the disease, or even if the patient's body temperature is normal, as long as the bacilli are still alive in the tissues, they can be found. This significant discovery not only helps a lot with the "etiological diagnosis" of typhoid fever, but also provides a concrete answer to the pathological explanation of typhoid fever recurrence. (2) Using the same amount of bone marrow and blood for culture, because the bone marrow contains more bacilli, they grow more vigorously, so using bone marrow culture to diagnose the source of the disease can be determined earlier. (3) In obese women and children, veins are often thin or hidden by fat, making it difficult to perform venipuncture for blood culture. In this case, bone marrow culture is the only way to find typhoid bacilli in the body tissues, because sternal puncture will not fail.

Some people are carriers, so finding typhoid bacilli in bile, intestinal contents, stool, and urine is not as accurate as finding them in bone marrow or blood. The Widal reaction has its shortcomings: (1) As mentioned above, serological agglutination is at best indirect evidence, far less straightforward than direct evidence. (2) In most typhoid fever patients, a positive reaction only appears in the late stages of the disease. By this time, clinical phenomena and other tests are already sufficient to confirm the diagnosis without a doubt. (3) People who have had typhoid fever in the past have agglutinins left in their blood. Therefore, a positive Widal reaction does not necessarily indicate that the current infectious disease is typhoid fever. Typhoid fever is similar to smallpox, measles, etc. Once infected, lifelong immunity can be produced. (4) Public health science has been gradually promoting typhoid fever vaccination in recent years, which is a dawn for national health and is truly gratifying. However, agglutinins are also produced in the blood after typhoid fever vaccination. Especially when suffering from non-typhoid high fever, the amount of agglutinins increases, the so-called Anamnestic Reaction. If only the Widal reaction is used for diagnosis, the result will be that many patients will be misdiagnosed as typhoid fever, which would be dangerous.

Using strict scientific eyes and objective experience to evaluate, among various etiological diagnostic methods, bone marrow and blood culture are the most important, followed by urine culture, followed by bile, intestinal contents, and stool culture, and the Widal reaction is even less important. Although, medicine is a living science; typhoid fever is formed by the double "living factors" of the patient and the bacilli to form a living case. The difference in typhoid fever cases is like the difference in human faces. The patient's reaction to various chemical tests also varies greatly. Therefore, to strive for the "etiological diagnosis" of typhoid fever, it is necessary to adopt various methods mentioned above extensively. The more evidence, the more precise the diagnosis. With a precise diagnosis, both the patient and the doctor can have a standard.

### The Pathology of Typhoid Fever

— Gu Suiyue

Typhoid fever is caused by typhoid bacilli invading the digestive tract with water, milk, or other food. It multiplies in the small intestine and enters the blood, leading to bacteremia. Its incubation period is about one to two weeks. Local characteristic changes occur in the intestinal lymphatic tissue, mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow. They are described separately below:

Changes in the intestinal tissue are seen in the solitary and aggregated lymph nodes of the intestine, especially the aggregated lymph nodes. First, the solitary and aggregated lymph nodes in the lower segment of the ileum are affected, then the lymph nodes in the upper segment of the ileum and jejunum are affected. The cecum and large intestine may also be affected. The course of typical typhoid fever can be divided into four stages: (1) The first stage is medullary swelling, which is the change in the first week. The lymph nodes are congested, red and swollen, and then the congestion subsides, appearing gray, while the swelling remains protruding. This is the phenomenon of lymphatic tissue hyperplasia. There are many small lymphocytes inside, as well as mononuclear macrophages containing red blood cells and bacilli, surrounding the mucous membrane of the lymph node. (2) The second stage is necrosis, which is the change in the second week. The center of the swollen aggregated lymph nodes and solitary lymph nodes softens and necroses, appearing yellow. (3) The third stage is ulcer formation, which is the change in the third week. The necrotic tissue falls off, forming an ulcer. The shedding starts from the edges and gradually forms an ulcer. Small nodules at the bottom of the ulcer may not fall off, so its surface is uneven. The ulcers of solitary lymph nodes are small and round; the ulcers of aggregated lymph nodes are large and oval, with the long axis generally along the longitudinal axis of the intestine. Sometimes the lymph nodes only swell and do not ulcerate, but this is rare. Sometimes the ulcers are quite deep, causing the blood vessels to ulcerate and bleed, or causing intestinal perforation, leading to severe acute peritonitis. (4) The fourth stage is the healing period, which is the change in the fourth and fifth weeks. Connective tissue grows at the ulcer site, becoming a scar. This scar is smooth and does not tend to contract, so intestinal stenosis as a sequelae is also very rare.

The mesenteric lymph nodes also swell, sometimes bleeding. Their lymphatic tissue presents the same changes as the intestinal aggregated lymph nodes. The sinuses contain many mononuclear macrophages, and bacilli can be seen in the lymphatic tissue and its contents.

The spleen is acutely congested and enlarged. The spleen pulp contains a large number of red blood cells and phagocytic mononuclear macrophages. Necrosis of intestinal aggregated lymph nodes and mesentery is also seen in this spleen.

Many littoral cells, mononuclear lymphocytes, and plasmacytes are also seen in the bone marrow. However, the development of granulocytic myeloid cells seems to stop.

Damage elsewhere: During the course of typhoid fever, other organs often undergo changes, such as degeneration or necrosis of the heart, kidney, and liver. Catarrhal changes in the respiratory system, transparent changes in the abdominal wall and its muscles. Other conditions such as otitis media, meningitis, and endocarditis are rarer.

### Minor Matters

— Shao Fu

On the streets of the two major districts, one often sees police officers with slanted leather belts supervising and directing traffic, and as a result, traffic has indeed improved a lot, which is very gratifying!

However, we still have a little worry, wondering if these traffic officers are permanent? Or temporary? If they are permanent, they should be given the **word**; otherwise, the past messy **situation** will inevitably return.

In addition to this, there is still a great puzzle, that is, why Nanjing Road prohibits rickshaws and pedicabs in the morning, while Beijing Road and Jiujiang Road do not prohibit cars? This is not only a matter of fairness, but also a big joke of the municipal authorities.

Do we just want Nanjing Road to be unimpeded, very smooth, and look very pleasing to the eye, and have a magnificent view? Do we **want** Beijing Road and Jiujiang Road to be congested with cars and people mixed together? If so, that's called a superficial municipality, that's called a bureaucratic municipality! If not, then the method must be corrected: prohibit cars from passing through Beijing Road and Jiujiang Road, or do not prohibit rickshaws and pedicabs from passing through Nanjing Road.

It seems like a very small matter, but it is related to "travel," and we have the reasonable freedom to demand "travel"; perhaps these words are very presumptuous, but we still put them forward, whether they are effective or not, it is up to you!

### In Memory of Engineer Hao Guilin

— Chen Xunjie

China needs construction, needs to revitalize industry, and absolutely cannot do without engineers.

The news of the suicide of French-educated engineer Hao Guilin, I think, people who see this news cannot possibly have no feelings! At least, in clothing, I shed tears of sympathy.

I myself am also an engineering student. When I finished reading this news, my eyes were filled with tears, dark shadows swirled in my mind, and my heart was filled with infinite anger, injustice, and grief. Mr. Hao's death means the engineering world has lost a companion!

Hao Guilin was born in **Year** 2 of the Republic of China and graduated from Beijing Ordnance School. He stayed in France for thirty years, which is not a short time. He studied the automotive industry and manufactured airplanes and tanks, graduated from Hanlu Mechanical Industrial School, and served as an engineer at the Paris Bisneux Ordnance Factory for many years. His accomplishments cannot be said to be not deep, and his mechanical experience cannot be said to be not rich. In France, he married a wife and had children. If he were a little selfish, even if the government ordered him **to return**, he could have a reason to refuse. However, driven by patriotism, he left his wife and children and resolutely returned to the motherland. He wanted to see the mountains and rivers after the victory and serve the motherland. At the beginning of his return to China, he was not without confidence, thinking that he would be able to settle down and develop. He did not expect to commit suicide! This was something he could not have foreseen in the beginning!

After returning to China, because he had no personal connections, he could not find a job, and he received only 20,000 yuan a month, which was not enough to maintain his life. He also learned that his parents and brothers had all sacrificed during the Anti-Japanese War. For a time, he was depressed, grieved, and indignant, leading to his suicide. The pain in his heart can be imagined!

Although Mr. Hao died by suicide, I ask, why did he commit suicide? He lived a good life in France. If there had been no government order, he would not have returned to China. He returned, and if the government had assigned him a job, he would have worked happily. However, he committed suicide because he had no job, could not bear the pressure of life, and was no longer willing to live!

Mr. Hao is dead. Hao Guilin's death reflects the imperfection of China's entire organizational structure, and at the same time arouses doubts and sadness among engineers. In the future, who among engineers can guarantee that they will not encounter the same fate as Mr. Hao?

China needs construction, needs to revitalize **industry**, and absolutely cannot do without engineers. However, the status of engineers has not been improved because of the need for construction.

Although China currently lacks construction talent, it is not completely without it. Talent recalled from abroad cannot be used well and assigned to jobs. In this way, even if the whole country is full of talent, there will still be a lament of scarcity!

China will embark on the road of construction in the future and needs various talents in construction. If things continue like this, the future is unimaginable!

Mr. Hao's suicide will at least arouse infinite sympathy and sorrow among engineers, as well as emotional unease. Mr. Hao's death is not only a loss to the engineering world, but also a great loss to the country!

We shout: Improve the treatment of engineers, raise the status of engineers, and hope that such things will not happen again in the future. Then Mr. Hao, though dead, will be happy in the afterlife.

### President Truman's Daughter, Miss Margaret

— Dongfang Jing

President Truman's daughter, Miss Margaret, recently graduated from the History Department of Washington University with a Bachelor of Arts degree; at the same time, her father received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree. Margaret said, "Dad, I studied hard for four years to get a diploma, but you got it effortlessly."

### Talking About Servants

— Wei Li

In ordinary families in Shanghai, it is indispensable to hire a servant to help with housework. However, in the wave of "labor supreme," hiring a loyal servant is very troublesome, and at the same time, one must also endure a lot of idleness. When many housewives talk about servants, eight or nine out of ten will frown and shake their heads, just like being "terrified at the mention of a tiger."

My family recently hired a 39-year-old woman through a neighbor's introduction because my mother was not feeling well. Under the condition of 30,000 yuan per month, she became my family's servant.

In the first few days, my mother was busier than usual, teaching this servant all the housework. Because she was very capable, she learned everything after being taught once. My mother was very happy and praised her greatly. This caused her to become proud, and her airs gradually grew.

This servant hates us calling her "Niang Yi" (a common term for a female servant). She thinks the word "Niang Yi" is very shameful. She wants us to call her "A San Niang," A San is the **son** of her ex-husband. Recently, she became acquainted with another vegetable vendor, and every Saturday night she would use the excuse of seeing her son to go back and have a rendezvous with that lover. She would only arrive late on Monday morning. So my family had to cook our own meals every Sunday. A San Niang also understood Western customs very well, and she took it upon herself to create a trend of "Sunday off for servants"!

Not only that, **we** also had to listen to two hours of Shanghai opera every night before she could sleep. So my family's radio was occupied by A San Niang. My mother did not interfere because "it's hard to hire a servant," and I could only swallow my anger. However, secretly, I had a war of radio program contention with her. I loved to listen to music, but she wanted to listen to Shanghai opera. When she couldn't hear it, she would grumble: "What's so good about music? It sounds like cats and dogs calling, Shanghai opera is more flavorful!"

A San Niang gradually complained that my family's wages were low, there was no "extra income," things were too busy, and there were too many people. Moreover, she often secretly took rice back, and clothes were often missing. Therefore, my mother despised her and fired her. When she left, she scolded my mother for having no conscience. So my mother vowed to never hire a servant again, and I strongly agreed!

Since that cunning A San Niang left, my family has become more harmonious and more harmonious. The radio has also been liberated; the rice has not been stolen. Although my mother is a little more tired, she is much happier than before when she was angry.

I feel that as long as time permits, it is better to do all the housework yourself. Servants will not bring you comfort; on the contrary, they will indirectly destroy the harmonious atmosphere in the family. Everyone has a pair of hands, why spend money to hire servants?

If the servants form a union and a strike occurs, then for those housewives who rely on servants and are unwilling to do anything themselves, many unimaginable difficulties will arise!

Lazy housewives! I worry about you!

### Diet Day

— Fang Jun

The war brought victory to the Allies, and the war also brought famine to the world. It is said that famine is an inevitable phenomenon after the war, but it is also an unavoidable fact. Therefore, the Allied countries have the establishment of the Relief Administration, and China also has tens of millions of people waiting to die. These tens of millions of people have all escaped from the hands of the god of death of the war. I don't want to see that after the victory, they are still waiting to "die," then the tragedy of the fate of the Chinese people still needs to seek a final solution from the side of not being able to die well. What the Chinese people can and cannot do, the conclusion lies in this word "death." However, you don't have to worry, another group of Chinese people are complaining that the minced meat is not worthy of their appetite. Haven't the economic news in the newspapers these days been reporting that large wings are selling well? The price of things like North Mushrooms is still quite firm. Speaking of famine, I can't see anyone with a haggard face here, unless it's myself. On the contrary, the business of teahouses and restaurants is extremely good. If you go one step late, you can't find an empty seat, but only flies are customers at street food stalls. The situation is obviously different from wartime. During wartime, the citizens could only sacrifice to the five internal organs at the food stalls. According to the above statement, it can be known that the Chinese people have their own "eugenics," and only those who are uncompetitive (?) will be forced to the line of death. — I'm really not saying something lightly here.

However, it is undeniable that famine has become a universal phenomenon in the world, so the rich people in foreign countries are opening their mouths and shouting, asking everyone to go on a diet. Here today, all kinds of newspapers are following up with an echo in the social or feature articles. Everyone also stipulates that today is Diet Day, and the rice and grain saved from the diet are to prevent the current and future famine. However, should these rice and grains saved from the diet be stored at **home** by the households? Or donated to a relief organization? Everyone did not propose, and the newspaper did not have any follow-up. I think it is to ask everyone to save food, and let the people waiting to die wait to die. Because the people waiting to die are not only "waiting to die," but also simply deserve to die!

From practical observation, how much has been saved here on Diet Day? No one can tell anyone, because the crowded situation in the market has not been reduced by a single point. The teahouses, restaurants, and restaurants in the three markets of morning, noon, and evening are still crowded, and except for the beggars following people, anyone is full and fat, and even a drop of water has not been saved. It can be known that today's Diet Day is afraid that only the promoters have saved two pieces of bread, and the rest of the sentient beings have not reduced their "food and sex" at all. This really wrongs the newspapers for making this echo, and people often treat his voice as a dog bark.

### Letter from Fan Jiping, Leader of the Star East Football Team

To the Editor:

Yesterday, your newspaper's "Free Talk" section in "News Small World" stated that after expenses for our team's matches in Shanghai, each team member could receive over five million yuan in rewards, which is greatly different from the facts. After checking, our team prepared for a month in Hong Kong before coming to Shanghai for sightseeing and to learn. In addition, the expenses for purchasing luggage, round-trip travel expenses, and expenses while staying in Shanghai are all considerable. We would be content if we did not lose money. How could we have extravagant hopes for further income?

What your newspaper published may be a joke based on hearsay, but a joke is a small matter, a misunderstanding is a big matter. If this causes misunderstandings among outsiders towards our team or among the players towards the organizers of our team, then it will be very difficult to explain and clarify. Therefore, I am writing this special letter to request

a correction. This is my sincere request.

Sincerely,

Fan Jiping, Leader of the Star East Football Team, June 20th

Addressed to:

The Editorial Department of Shen Bao

### Eastern-Youth Match Decides the Australian Expedition List

— Feng Yi

There is also a secret behind the match between the Hong Kong Star East Football Team and the Qingbai team. In addition to the matches, the Star East team also wanted to win over a few players to go on an expedition to Australia. Because the Shanghai Qingbai team used to be members of the Eastern team in Hong Kong, and speaking of it, they were originally family, so the two teams had a considerable intention of re-joining forces. After several negotiations, the two sides could not agree because of different opinions. Originally, the Star East team had been invincible in its four matches in Shanghai and believed that it should take the initiative, only wanting to select four people from the Qingbai team to play supporting roles. The Qingbai team, on the other hand, believed that its own strength was strong and insisted on participating with six people. To outsiders, four people and six people may not seem to be very different, but in their minds, there is a great reason for this, because the official lineup of a football team is only eleven people. If the Qingbai team can occupy six seats, it will be in a dominant position. Therefore, the Star East team was unwilling to agree at that time, and the reason lies in this. At the same time, the main character and the supporting role, for the entire control aspect, whether it is the match or the funding, clearly know that there is a lot of room for profit, naturally no one wants to suffer losses. Since both sides are "widows raising children" - "old hands", it is naturally easy to become a deadlock. However, the progress of the matter did not "break up" as ideal, and everyone felt a strong interest in the good thing of going on an expedition to Australia after all. Therefore, the final negotiation decided to use the Qingbai match as the standard for allocating the number of people. That is to say: If Qingbai **wins**, **six people** will attend, otherwise, four people will go. So in the match the other day, **both** sides were particularly diligent, and there was a little reason for that. As a result, Qingbai unexpectedly overwhelmed Star East 3-1, creating an absolute advantage, so it is expected that the list of names for the expedition to Australia will be dominated by Qingbai, it can also be said that this is the victory that Qingbai's sweat and labor have earned.

### Sa Zhenbing's Sigh

— Yushan Hui Chang

Senior naval veteran Admiral Sa Zhenbing, having reached a great age, still labors for the country, and his spirit is vigorous. He uses poetry to pass the time after official duties, showing his elegance and refinement. Earlier, my old friend Qin Bowei, after reading Admiral Sa's "Gems of Leisure", composed three poems in the five-character-regular-verse style, which I sent to Fujian. Admiral Sa replied, stating that **Mr.** Qin is skilled in medicine, possessing three perfections, and has a heroic reputation. Now I will record Admiral Sa's reply poems:

Having served in the military for fifty years, I am ashamed of my meager contribution.
In my old age, I am particularly worried about the country, and I always uphold fairness when discussing talent.
Neighboring soldiers still oppress the border, and border officials rarely call themselves heroes.
When will the struggle for land end? The battlefield is dyed red with blood.

Battles near and far are raging, teachers and students have labored for ten years.
What we seek is to secure the nation, not to acquire grapes.
Decisively win over a thousand miles, and resolve the complexities with a single stroke.
Let us take advantage of this day to revitalize the country, and work together with our compatriots.

A belly full of classics, which are expressed in the sound of jade.
Jiangnan's beauty, Fujian province to listen to the long ming.
Four rhyme feelings unlimited, standing rely on a thousand words,
The medical world has presided for a long time, year after year to help the people.

### Central Bank Heist: Who Pays for the Advertising Fee?

— Wuling Ren

I was very pleased to see the headline in a certain newspaper: "Central Printing Plant Stops Printing Banknotes." But when I saw a small headline in the next line, "Will Be Printed in the United States and **Returned** Later," I was despondent again.

The suppression of opium is carried out with great force and vigor. It is said that after this month, anyone who is arrested will be severely punished. People on the blacklist are mostly uneasy. However, there are also those who hope to get away with it and remain optimistic. Their view is that "when the mountains and rivers are exhausted and there is no road, there is another village with shady willows and bright flowers," and they will find a way out of desperation at that time.

Recently, due to the Central Bank's large theft case, the police authorities have been investigating everywhere for a long time without capturing the main culprit. The bank has been running wanted advertisements in various newspapers for days, and this expense is quite considerable. Although the bank has a reason to pay for it and can list it as a proper expense, since this case has been reported to the public security authorities for handling, then which party should be responsible for this considerable advertising fee?

The public bond market has recently experienced extreme volatility. Securities and stocks have fallen sharply in a straight line. It is rumored that sixteen securities firms have gone bankrupt one after another, with a total debt of 2.6 billion. This is a major blow to speculators, but among these 2.6 billion, there are many ordinary citizens who covet high interest loans. It is always the ordinary citizens who suffer, unfairly and in vain.

It is said that Mayor Wu has paid close attention to the solicitation advertisements in the newspapers. It is expected that playing-card-style solicitation advertisements will soon disappear. However, Shanghainese are best at adapting to circumstances and playing tricks. Let's see what new tricks will appear.

### Social Service: The Xiang Disaster is Serious, Deaths are Piling Up; This Newspaper Will Collect Donations Starting Today

We earnestly appeal to people from all walks of life to actively promote and promote righteousness in disaster relief, as if saving from fire. The sooner the better, the merit is immeasurable.

A letter from the Shanghai Xiang Disaster Relief Committee says:

To the Editor:

Since the establishment of our committee, we have been actively preparing to launch a Xiang Disaster Relief campaign. In addition to distributing donation booklets and raising funds, we will also hold a joint charity performance for the Xiang disaster in northern Jiangsu and invite **Qing** and other four teams to hold a football charity match in the coming days, hoping to raise huge sums of money in a short period of time to urgently help the disaster-stricken people. We have long admired your newspaper for advocating **righteousness** and always being a social leader in the state. We hereby sincerely request you to raise your pen and call for donations to help millions of victims out of famine. Those who are grateful will not only be the suffering people, but also, sincerely ask, to the Zhong Bao.

(Editor's Note) The drought in Hunan Province has been prolonged and has not rained, and the disaster situation is very serious. Starving people are everywhere and cannot guarantee the evening! This newspaper has repeatedly used photos and text to make urgent appeals, hoping that people on the coast can save on disaster relief and donate more to fulfill the grand aspiration of "doing good is the most **important**". Now that we have accepted the entrustment of the Xiang Disaster Relief Committee, we will do our best to handle it. Starting today, we will start accepting donations from all walks of life to send urgent aid to the disaster area. The names of all donors, whether organizations or individuals, will be published to show credibility. This newspaper has always attached great importance to social justice. It has been like this in the past and will continue to be so in the future. At this difficult time, it is precisely to fulfill the duty of humanity, to serve the country and the people, and to serve the society. We do not want to use this as a slogan. We hope that our vast readers will work together to advocate and promote and enthusiastically promote and promote this **sincere and** great righteous act. We pay our respects to the victims nine times!

### Reader Q&A: Medicine and Hygiene

(1) Huang **asks** Mr. Editor: Please show some mercy, answer a few questions, and save me from my suffering! I have only been in Shanghai for more than 20 days. I am unfamiliar with the place and I am a worker. Due to limited money and time, I cannot solve my problems. Because your newspaper has a service **corner**, please give me an answer, I am very grateful. (Symptoms) There is a polyp in my nasal cavity, which some people call a nasal polyp, or **mushroom**. It is slowly growing, making both **nostrils** blocked and unable to breathe. I breathe through my mouth and often have yellow nasal discharge. My head often hurts. I have had it surgically removed once, but it relapsed two or three years later. May I ask: (1) Which hospital or private doctor is the best in Shanghai? (2) Can this disease be cured completely without recurring? (3) Is this disease dangerous? (4) What should I pay attention to usually?

[Answer by Dr. Gu Yuqi, MD] (1) The otolaryngology departments of Shanghai Municipal Hospitals have specialized doctors in charge of treatment (such as the Fourth Hospital) near Hongkou, which is close to your factory. (2) It must be treated surgically. (3) This disease is not dangerous for the time being. If it is not treated, it may develop **pus** in the future. (4) You must follow the doctor's instructions.

(2) Wang Haoran asks: I often play basketball in the summer, and I feel a heavy heartbeat after exercise. Recently, even if I don’t play basketball, I feel the same way, and I sometimes have stabbing pains. My heart feels swollen and painful. When I am a little nervous, such as watching a play or gambling, my heartbeat will shake my whole body. Sometimes I am awakened by a heartbeat at night. Please give me an answer and a good way to treat it. I will be grateful and never forget it.

[Answer by Dr. Gu Yuqi, MD] Please go to the Department of Internal Medicine of a municipal hospital for a detailed examination to see if you have heart disease or beriberi (i.e., lack of vitamin B).

(3) Shi Hao asks: Since the beginning of spring, my right leg has suddenly felt severe pain. At first, I thought it was a muscle strain. After consulting a doctor, it was said to be sciatica. I took oral and injected Hovalgin, and although the severe pain has stopped after two months, there is still a slight ache and a feeling of numbness, from my foot up. It is even worse when I sit, which is quite painful. I don't know if there is any way to recover quickly? Please ask your doctor to give detailed instructions.

[Answer by Dr. Gu Yuqi, MD] In addition to oral medication and injections for sciatica, shortwave electrotherapy can be used. It is best to check the pressure and urine, and check for cavities.
