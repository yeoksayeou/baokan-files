[Central News Agency Kuling Dispatch, 4th] Marshal Marshall went to the headquarters to pay a visit to Chairman Chiang at 8:30 PM on the evening of the 4th. President Song Ziwen was also present. It is reported that the content of the talk involved the Anping Incident.

[Our Newspaper Kuling Dispatch, 4th] Special Envoy Marshall visited Ambassador Stuart at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 4th and had a long talk lasting for an hour. It is reported that Marshal Marshall stated that peace talks would be very difficult to proceed with until the U.S. military attack incident was resolved. Regarding the withdrawal of U.S. troops stationed in China, Ambassador Stuart believes that it is not yet likely to be implemented.

[Our Newspaper Kuling Dispatch, 4th] Ambassador Stuart, Marshal's wife, and Madam Chiang all went to church for service at 11:00 AM on the 4th. At 5:00 PM in the afternoon, Ambassador Stuart responded to a visit from Special Envoy Marshall, talking for half an hour. It is reported that the Ambassador will pay another visit to the Chairman on the 5th and is scheduled to return to Nanjing on the 6th.

[Our Newspaper Kuling Dispatch, 4th] According to Ambassador Stuart, he told our newspaper reporter that he and the Chinese government had both received a report on the "Anping Incident" and that he was now awaiting orders from Washington to handle the matter. He hopes that this unusual and unfortunate incident will not affect normalcy. As the Ambassador said this, he was leaning against the window reading a book, with a calm and composed demeanor and a kind smile, which shows the Ambassador's warm friendship towards China, enthusiasm, and patience.

[French News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] It is rumored that President Truman has authorized Special Envoy Marshall to make his own judgments in order to gradually withdraw U.S. troops from China to avoid unexpected events such as the Anping Incident from happening again. This statement was denied by Marshal Marshall's office, which stated that they had never heard of it.

[Our Newspaper Kuling Dispatch, 4th] President Song arrived in Kuling from Shanghai at 7:00 PM on the afternoon of the 4th. Without going to the Sun-illuminated Peak mansion to rest, he went directly to the headquarters to pay a visit to Chairman Chiang, reporting on administrative affairs and making requests. He left after about an hour. President Song said: (1) He intends to discuss the Anping Incident with Minister Peng before reporting it further. (2) Regarding the bombing incident in Yan'an, because he only saw it in the newspapers, he did not know the details. (3) He (Song referring to himself) has decided to rush back to Nanjing on the 5th to attend the regular meeting of the Executive Yuan.

[Central News Agency Kuling Dispatch, 4th] President Song's arrival in Kuling was warmly welcomed by all circles. When President Song entered the streets of Kuling, he got out of the sedan chair and talked to reporters while walking, saying that he had been away from Lushan for more than ten years.

### Kirk Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday from Kuling; Visited the Chairman and Discussed Training Our Navy; Kept the Contents of Talks with Marshal and Others Confidential

[Our Newspaper Kuling Dispatch, 4th] U.S. Commander of the Fleet in China, Admiral Kirk, left Kuling at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 4th with his wife, son, and daughter to go to Nanjing via Shanghai, escorted down the mountain by Staff Officer Pi Zonggan. Before descending the mountain, Admiral Kirk met with our newspaper reporter. He said that he was deeply grateful for the warm hospitality of Chairman Chiang and his wife during this trip to the mountain and had a pleasant few days of leisure. Regarding the U.S. military attack incident on the Pingjin Highway, Admiral Kirk gave a detailed account of the incident, saying that according to reports, the incident was perpetrated by the 53rd Regiment of the Communist Army. Three U.S. soldiers were killed and ten were injured. The U.S. military included officers from the Executive Headquarters, who were transporting supplies from Tianjin to the Executive Headquarters in Peiping, including some Executive Headquarters materials. The transport team regularly traveled from Tianjin to Peiping twice a week. This time, there were indeed many people lying in ambush in advance. They were attacked before they could resist. However, Admiral Kirk declined to comment on the content of his talks with Marshal Marshall and Ambassador Stuart. At the same time, he also said that he was not in a position to express the attitude of the U.S. government and his personal opinions. Admiral Kirk went on to say that after arriving on the mountain, he had discussed with the Chairman the issue of jointly training the Chinese Navy, and the U.S. had donated a total of sixteen ships to our country.

[United Press Kuling Dispatch, 4th] Admiral Kirk told reporters today that he had reported to Chairman Chiang on the progress of the Chinese Navy training program and discussed the Anping Incident. Kirk flatly denied the communist claim that U.S. Marines attacked the communist army, saying that a U.S. convoy carrying Executive Headquarters items to the Executive Headquarters in Peiping to be handed over to U.S. officers was ambushed by the communist army en route. When asked what steps the U.S. government would take, Kirk replied that he did not know.

[Reuters Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] Admiral Kirk recently denied rumors that U.S. Marines would soon withdraw from North China. Kirk returned to Shanghai from Kuling and stopped here briefly. It is reported that Kirk had discussed various outstanding issues with Marshal Marshall in Kuling last night, so Kirk did not need to participate in the two's talks again this morning.

[Our City News] Admiral Kirk returned to the Hua Mao Hotel on the fifth floor yesterday from Kuling and hosted Chinese and foreign reporters to report on something.

The Eleventh War Zone Announced the Details of the Anping Case

[Central News Agency Peiping Dispatch, 3rd] A spokesman for the Eleventh War Zone announced the details of the attack on the U.S. military by the communist army near Xianghe, stating: On July 29, when 41 U.S. Marine Corps officers and soldiers were suddenly attacked by the communist army near Anping Town, Commander Sun attached great importance to it and immediately ordered Deputy Chief of Staff Song Yuan of the war zone, along with Commissioner Huang Rencai of the Fifth District, County Magistrate Ban Changhui Ru of Xianghe, and others, to go to the scene of the incident to conduct an on-the-spot investigation. Deputy Chief of Staff Song Yuan and others arrived at Matou Town at 6:00 AM on the 2nd. After inquiring with the garrison, they went to Anping Town to conduct a detailed on-the-spot investigation with the local gentry. The location of the U.S. military attack was near the Dasha River Village, about eight li southeast of Anping Town. This area is the junction of Tong County, Wuqing, and Xianghe counties. Deep ditches have been dug on both sides of the road, and dense corn has been planted next to the ditches for concealment. According to the villagers, U.S. military vehicles are often seen passing through this road, and no accidents have occurred. Recently, about 400 to 500 members of the 53rd Regiment (14th Military Sub-district) of the Communist Army, led by Li Minxi, often appear in nearby villages, wearing mostly gray military uniforms and civilian clothes, forcibly distributing food and intercepting pedestrians. On July 25, they convened an anti-American movement meeting for the villagers. On July 27 and 28, they blockaded traffic in the area southeast of Anping Town, blocked news, and intercepted pedestrians, intending to make preparations in that area. After the villagers knelt down and begged to avoid the scourge of war, they refused. At 12:20 PM on the 29th, they ambushed in the deep ditches on both sides of the Dasha River road and in nearby villages and woods, and forcibly grabbed the people's ox carts to block the road. When U.S. military trucks passed through the area, they were suddenly attacked by the ambush. When asked about the battle at the time, they said: "We, the common people, dare not go to see it. We only know that three U.S. soldiers were killed and more than a dozen were injured. The communist army also suffered dozens of casualties. That evening, they left in a northeast direction. We dare not ask where they went. Before leaving, they took away an old man from the town because he knew how to shoot. At 4:00 PM, Deputy Chief of Staff Gao returned to Peiping with the mediation personnel after the truth had been revealed. According to the Anping Town Xiaosha River, the first squadron of the Xianghe County Police was stationed there before June 2. Later, due to the adjustment of defense affairs, the squadron was transferred to Shicao (two li southwest of Matou Town), and no national army has been stationed there since.

### The Attack on the U.S. Military Was a Premeditated Communist Conspiracy

[Our Newspaper Kuling Dispatch, 4th] According to a certain authoritative source, "The Communist Party has publicly admitted the 'Anping Incident.' It is said that the U.S. military travels back and forth on the Pingjin Road to transport supplies to the U.S. military personnel belonging to the Peiping Military Mediation Department twice a week. Its mission is very clear. The Peiping Military Mediation Department is an organization shared by the Kuomintang, the Communist Party, and the United States. The Communist Party's claim that the U.S. military and the National Army attacked the 'Liberated Areas' is a slanderous statement. It is evident that the occurrence of this incident was a premeditated act. We should pay attention to this kind of 'suspicious' propaganda by the Communist Party."

### Three Seriously Wounded U.S. Soldiers Sent to Qingdao for Treatment

[Central News Agency Peiping Dispatch, 4th] Of the twelve U.S. soldiers who were wounded in the attack in Dasha River Village on July 29, three were seriously wounded and were transported by special plane to Qingdao on the morning of the 2nd and handed over to the U.S. Naval Hospital Ship Repose for treatment. In addition, several of the wounded U.S. soldiers who remained in Peiping with minor injuries have been discharged from the hospital, and those who have not yet been discharged are all in good condition. In recent days, many official and civilian representatives have gone to express their condolences.

### Government Aircraft Did Not Pass Over Yan'an While Performing Missions; Spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense Refutes the Communist Party's Attempt to Stir Up Trouble

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] A spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense made a statement on the 4th, stating: A National Army aircraft lost its way on June 26 and was forced to land in the northern suburbs of Yan'an. Later, because it was unable to fly back, the Air Force authorities dispatched a plane to destroy the aircraft on the 2nd of this month. It was found that the aircraft was parked in the mountains near the Yan'an suburbs airport, and the dispatched aircraft did not pass over Yan'an while performing this mission. Recently, Yan'an Radio has been publicizing that National Army aircraft bombed Yan'an, which is purely a fictitious story fabricated by the Communist Party to sensationalize.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The bombing of Yan'an has caused an unwarranted panic among the Communist Party delegation. However, according to a spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense, the bombing was carried out because the aircraft that was previously forced to land in Yan'an could not be retrieved, so the target was clearly not their "headquarters," but the aircraft. The Communist Party's claim that the bombing of Yan'an was a "signal of the launch of a full-scale civil war" shows that they are doing their utmost to provoke. A certain military official said: "We naturally only bombed that one aircraft. If we wanted to bomb Yan'an, why would we wait until today?" The Communist Party spokesman's claim of "unprecedented seriousness" is of unknown basis.

### The Communist Party is Making Unfounded Accusations

The National Army No Longer Has the 92nd Division

How Can There Be a Matter of the Capture of the Commander and Deputy Commander?

[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] Regarding the "capture of the commander and deputy commander of the 92nd Division of the National Army" mentioned by Xinhua News Agency on August 2, the reporter visited a spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense to inquire about the truth. The spokesman said that the National Army no longer has the 92nd Division after the reorganization. Part of the 92nd Brigade of the National Army stationed in the Yugou area southeast of Xuzhou was attacked by the Communist Army on July 28 and retreated slightly. Ai, the commander of the 92nd Brigade, and Shen Shengkai, the deputy commander, personally led their troops to reinforce them and repelled the Communist Army. Xinhua News Agency first fabricated the story that Commander Ai had been captured. On the 3rd, Yan'an Radio used the excuse of a misreport and denied it itself. It can be seen that the Communist Party's propaganda has always been unfounded and has no factual basis.

### Chief of Staff Chen Arrived in Kuling; Inspected the Garrison While Passing Through Xunyang

[Central News Agency Kuling Dispatch, 4th] Chief of Staff Chen Cheng arrived in Kuling from Nanjing at 5:00 PM on the afternoon of the 4th. While passing through Xunyang, he inspected the troops led by Liang Bo and met with Major General Zhang Rizhang, the commander of the gunboat flotilla, to inquire about the Yangtze River defense. After arriving in Kuling, he went directly to his private residence at No. 106 Zhonglu to rest. The Chief of Staff's wife and his six children, both male and female, came with him. The Central News Agency reporter went to welcome him between Banshanting and Xiaotianchi. The Chief of Staff said that his stomach ailment had healed for three weeks and that he did not feel tired after a five-hour long air journey today. When asked about military and political issues, the Chief of Staff promised to talk about them in detail tomorrow.

### A Communist Army Instructor in Shandong Abandoned Darkness and Defected in Jinan

[Central News Agency Jinan Dispatch, 4th] Li Guowei, the political instructor of the Communist Army's Weihe Detachment in Western Shandong, witnessed the Communist Army's harming the country and the people and its obvious crimes. Unwilling to be deceived and used, he took advantage of the opportunity of being sent to Jinan to carry out assassination work on the 3rd and defected to the Second Pacification Zone Command, and personally wrote an autobiography, announcing his permanent withdrawal from the Communist Party.

### Chairman Decided to Personally Preside Over Summer Camp Commemorative Week

After the commemorative week, the Chairman will summon the leaders of the summer camp above the battalion level for instructions. Also, at 9:00 AM on August 7, the Chairman will go to the summer camp to summon all the officials for a roll call and speech.

### The U.S.'s Established China Policy Will Definitely Not Be Changed

[Reuters Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] Chairman Chiang is now in Kuling, consulting with Marshall and Stuart, and all parties believe that the situation is "extremely serious." Chinese officials pointed out that the U.S.'s China policy has been clarified by Secretary of State Burns and approved by President Truman, and is unlikely to be changed at this time. It is uncertain whether it will affect the U.S.'s already established China policy even after the situation is clarified. The Communist Party is now continuing to exert pressure on the U.S. military authorities to "withdraw from China." The Communist Party's newspapers have stated: "We reiterate our demand that the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force completely withdraw from China as a permanent solution." Nanjing newspapers quoted a U.S. military spokesman as saying that the United States deeply regrets this incident, but all U.S. troops will not immediately withdraw from China because they are staying in China at the request of Chairman Chiang. When asked for his thoughts on the Anping Incident, he replied: "I heard that Marshall told the 'Central Daily News' that it was 'extremely bad.'"

### The U.S. Has Issued a Warning to Yan'an Regarding the Marine Corps Attack Incident; Gillem Says the Work of the Military Advisory Group is Intensifying

[Central News Agency This City Dispatch] U.S. Commander in China General Gillem met with reporters yesterday and said that the United States and China have always been good friends and fought side by side during the war to defeat the enemy. This is an undeniable fact that is obvious to all. Today, with the end of World War II, we are working for the safety of the world and the future peace of mankind. This task is even more important and requires more effort and struggle from us. The United States has always hoped to cooperate with China and work for the safety of mankind. After the Anping Incident, the U.S. military has issued a warning to Yan'an. General Gillem did not want to make any further comments. The reporter then asked that the U.S. public opinion has different criticisms on the Chinese incident recently, and some people have written articles not long ago, advocating stopping the transportation of military supplies to China. The general refused to criticize this matter, but expressed that China and the United States are friendly, and the US is willing to help China solve its difficulties. He also stated that people engaged in journalism also bear a major responsibility for world security, and the world's people today should all strive for this goal. General Gillem has been in the military for more than 30 years and participated in the First and Second World Wars. He solemnly stated that maintaining world peace is not only the duty of soldiers, but also the responsibility of all mankind. When the reporter inquired about the exact date of the U.S. military's withdrawal from Shanghai, he was unwilling to announce it and only said that it was in the near future. Gillem himself will postpone the announcement of any position after the end of the command. The closure of the U.S. military command in Shanghai is because their mission has been completed, and the military advisory group in Nanjing and the military mediation department in Peiping will continue their tasks. When talking about the military advisory group, General Gillem said that the agency is intensifying its work. If peace in China is achieved soon, the work of training the Chinese army, navy, and air force can be actively carried out. The Chinese side has sent more than 100 instructors to the United States for advanced studies, and they will also participate in the work of the advisory group after returning to China. The advisory group is currently planning to select a suitable location for the training camp for the army. The group has a large number of specialized military personnel from the United States. Finally, the reporter asked about his impression of China. The general smiled and said, "Very good," and detailed his daily life for the reporter. In his spare time, the general likes to play baseball. Every weekend, he often organizes baseball teams to play friendly baseball games at his private residence.

### Negotiating to Mediate the Conflict in the Central Plains; Li Xiannian Has Not Yet Responded; Cheng Qian Reports on the Communist Army's Attack

[Central News Agency Hankou Dispatch, 3rd] The heads of the Party, government, military, and groups in Wuhan jointly hosted reporters today, presided over by Director Cheng Qian and Chairman Wan Yaohuang. Director Cheng reported on the spot, saying: "Since June 26, Li Xiannian's Communist Army has violated the Luoshan Agreement and launched a large-scale offensive, leading his troops from the east of the Pinghan Railway, crossing the Pinghan Road to the west, and attacking the National Army along the way, killing civilians, and burning houses. Its main force has captured Xinye and Jingziguan and is still occupying the area west of Shanyang, actively preparing for war. Another part has captured Yicheng, Nanzhang, Baokang, Zhushan, and other counties. Our government still adheres to the principle of peace and has sent the Ninth Group to Laohekou by plane, sending a notice by plane, inviting Li Xiannian to send representatives to conduct peace talks again. Despite repeated urgings, they have all been rejected. As of now, a force of more than a thousand has sneaked to Zhuyuhe in the west of Zhushan, and its vanguard has sneaked to Bainenggou (at the junction of Zhu Xi and Luoping counties). Another force of about a thousand has sneaked west from Shihua Street to the area south of Wufushan, attempting to penetrate the border area between Sichuan and Hubei in order to achieve their ambition of separating and dominating. Today, Li Xiannian's ferocity is unreasonable, but the government still hopes that peace is not hopeless and will not abandon its original intention of peace. On the 28th of last month, the three-person group made a temporary agreement stipulating that both sides would temporarily cease the conflict and invited Li Xiannian to go to Xi'an for peace talks before August 5. Whether this agreement will be successful depends on whether Li Xiannian goes or not. If he does not go at that time, or does not send representatives, it is willing to destroy peace and abandon the people of the country, then the agreement will be invalid."

[Central News Agency Hankou Dispatch, 3rd] The Ninth Group, stationed in Laohekou for more than half a month to mediate the conflict in the Central Plains, sent four letters to Li Xiannian last month, inviting him to send representatives to Longjuzhai to negotiate with the 32nd Group, but received no response. Before the group prepared to fly to Xi'an and then to Peiping for instructions, they met with the Communist representatives in Laohekou and reached a temporary agreement that a ceasefire period would be provisionally set from 4:00 AM on the 2nd to the 20th. The agreement stipulated that the agreement would be signed in Xi'an on the 25th. The Ninth Group flew back to Hankou on the 1st and flew to Xi'an from Hankou at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 3rd. Regardless of whether Li Xiannian fulfills the agreement, they will fly to Peiping.

### Cars Between Tianjin and Yangcun Were Twice Robbed by the Communist Army

The Communist Army told commercial vehicles that anyone carrying more than 100,000 yuan in cash or transporting food would be detained.

### Communist Forces in Northern Jiangsu Retreat Towards Gaoyou; National Army Recovers Dayiji; Military and Political Personnel Stationed in Three Counties of Northern Anhui

[Our Yangzhou Dispatch, 4th] The Yang-Tian Highway was cleared on the 4th. National Army forces have joined at Dayiji. Communist forces are retreating towards Gaoyou. Remaining communist elements southwest of Gaoyou Lake are awaiting complete suppression. As a result, the communication line from Tianchang in Anhui, through Yangzhou and Taixian in Jiangsu, to Haian Town has been completely recovered. Full traffic on the road is expected imminently. This is a significant gain since the National Army's counteroffensive in Jiangsu and Anhui.

[Our Taixian Dispatch, 4th] (1) Our army advancing from Tangdong, after joining forces with troops stationed in Haian, is currently pursuing and suppressing communist forces gathered at Fuanji and Yijiaji.

(3) Approximately one regiment of communist forces still occupies Jingjia Village, and is reinforcing its defenses. (4) A small number of militia are harassing the vicinity of Dabaimi. They retreated after the defending National Army counterattacked. (5) On the Tianchang front, our army recovered Dayiji at 9:00 AM today.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] (1) The bulk of communist forces in Taixian have been suppressed. However, remnant communist elements in the Mojiazhuang area, north of Dabaimi Town, still attempt to cause trouble. (2) On the Yang-Tai Highway, the remaining communist 82nd Division is stationed at Qilidian, and the 88th Division is stationed at Yiling, both with the intention of disrupting and attempting to cut off the Yang-Tai Highway. (3) New Fourth Army elements were discovered in Yangshu Town, southwest of Jingjiang. They were repelled by the National Army today. (4) After the National Army joined forces and recovered Haian, the communist forces in the Dongtai area have no defensible positions.

[Our Taixian Dispatch, 4th] (1) The National Army advancing north in the Rugao area, proceeding from Faqiao, recovered Haian yesterday morning. A large number of spoils were seized. The three regiments of the communist 7th Column stationed in the town retreated towards Dongtai. The National Army is pursuing and suppressing them, and is currently confronting them a few li north of the town. (2) After the National Army recovered Haian, advancing troops from the Qutang area eliminated all resistance, advanced eastward, and officially joined forces with friendly forces in Haian. It is reported that the communist forces in northern Jiangsu, attempting to threaten Nanjing and Shanghai and create a separatist regime, launched an offensive against Liangtai and Tongyang areas starting on the 13th of last month. The National Army, responsible for defending the territory, was forced to fight back and, in order to protect the capital and relieve the people's suffering, successively advanced into Gongqiao, Meiyan, Qutang, Baimi, Rugao, Haian, and other places. Now, the three strongholds of northern Jiangsu, Yangzhou, Taizhou, and Nantong, have been unified. The situation in northern Jiangsu will enter a new phase. (3) According to informed sources, the Tong-Tai Highway will be officially opened to traffic within a few days.

[Central News Agency, Hefei Dispatch, 4th] It is reported that the communist forces in Sixian, Wuhe, and Xuyi counties have all retreated. Our military and political personnel have entered the cities to handle pacification and post-disaster affairs.

### How Cruel are the Communists! The Grand Canal Embankment in Shandong is Breached Again; Water in Liaocheng is Several Feet Deep; Tens of Thousands of Lives Will Be Buried in the Belly of Fish

[Central News Agency, Jinan Dispatch, 4th] It is heard from informed sources: On the night of July 31st, communist forces breached the Grand Canal embankment, causing water to flow into Liaocheng. Tens of thousands of lives in the city are in danger of being buried in the belly of fish. Liaocheng has been besieged by communist forces for seven months. Commissioner Wang Jinxiang led the military and civilians in a firm defense. The communist forces have repeatedly attacked without success. Recently, they dug up the embankment, and the water flowed directly into the city gates. The water outside the east gate is several feet deep and still rising. Residents downstream are the first to bear the brunt and have been submerged. Commissioner Wang has telegraphed the Jinan Party, government, and military authorities for emergency assistance.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou Dispatch, 4th] The communist forces in northern Jiangsu have used every possible inhuman act. In addition to large-scale destruction of the embankments of the Yun and Mu rivers, making the southeastern areas of Xuzhou a watery expanse, their political workers have recently taken away more than 30,000 young women from northern Jiangsu to transport supplies in the mountains of southern Shandong, such as Fengshan and Mengshan.

### Wang Maogong Cables Li Moan Requesting the Suppression of Bandits in the Taihu Lake Area; New Fourth Army Worker Liu Pingzhi Arrested

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 4th] Wang Maogong, concurrently Commander of the Jiangsu Province Security Forces, believes that with the urgent military situation in northern Jiangsu, the security of the rear is extremely important. He discovered that the bandits in the Taihu Lake area are gathering in increasing numbers and even raising the false flag of the "Jiangnan Democratic Allied Army." This clearly indicates a significant political background and cannot be regarded as a minor ailment. Moreover, the lakeside area is frequently harassed, and the people are suffering. In terms of water transportation, Taihu Lake is an important artery for three provinces, with frequent traffic. Now, due to the rampant banditry, water transportation has disappeared, which has a profound and significant impact on the national economy and people's livelihood. If a fundamental solution is not promptly devised, it will inevitably lead to future troubles and endless harm. Therefore, he specifically telegraphed General Li Moan, Commander of the First Pacification Zone, to preside over the suppression operation and ordered the heads of the lakeside districts and counties to lead their local armed forces to cooperate with the garrison troops and form a strong force. They are to be concentrated in lakeside strongholds within a specified time limit, awaiting orders to move out. He also ordered the Second Water Police Corps to deploy ships and implement a planned mobile patrol to undertake the task of searching and arresting on the lake. He also stated that this suppression operation will be coordinated simultaneously with the Zhejiang Province authorities to prevent the bandits from fleeing and achieve a thorough eradication effect.

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 4th] The military authorities stationed in Suzhou arrested a New Fourth Army worker named Liu Pingzhi at noon on the 3rd. Liu was found at No. 32, Qian Fan Village, Suzhou. A large amount of military radio equipment was confiscated. According to his confession, he served as a staff officer of the puppet 10th Division and had a very close personal relationship with Zhu De, Commander-in-Chief of the Communist Army. However, he vehemently denied participating in the work. All witnesses and evidence have now been transferred to the headquarters of the First Pacification Zone for verification.

### Two Daytime Robberies in Hangzhou

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 4th] Banditry in Zhejiang Province is quite rampant, and public security is a significant problem. The Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters, in order to ensure public safety, has strengthened its security forces and implemented armed patrols starting this month, which has been somewhat effective.

The other was when a traveler outside Fengshan Gate was robbed of a large guard bag and a diamond ring.

### Executive Yuan Handles Emergency Relief in Recovered Counties and Cities in the Northeast

[Central News Agency, Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The people of the Northeast have long suffered under enemy and puppet rule. They have been celebrating their restoration, only to be robbed again, and their lives are exceptionally difficult. The Executive Yuan has specifically ordered the Northeast Branch to expedite emergency relief in the recovered counties and cities. In addition to sending personnel to various places to investigate the disaster situation and carry out relief work, the branch has already distributed the first batch of clothing, which has been completely distributed in six counties and cities, including Jinzhou.

### Northeast Registers Soviet Military Currency; Local Banks Handle First

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 3rd] The issue of Soviet military currency is still one of the most painful issues for merchants.

Countless people were unable to return home without money. The four major banks, including the Central Bank, Bank of China, Agricultural Bank, and Farmers Bank, have not yet started registration.

[Central News Agency, Jinan Dispatch, 4th] The Zibo mining area is the largest resource in Shandong Province. Its mineral production is second only to that of the Northeast.

[Central News Agency, Chengdu Dispatch, 3rd] The Sichuan Provincial Assembly held a temporary meeting on the 31st of last month to discuss the issue of the actual levy, which was successfully resolved. It closed on the morning of the 2nd. Before closing, it passed a reply to Chairman Chiang's telegram, roughly stating: "It is determined that this year's levy and loan of actual goods is necessary for the country and for the essential expenses of provincial and county governments. This assembly should obey your orders, share the difficulties together, and support the established national policy. Therefore, a temporary meeting was convened on July 31 to discuss the issue of the actual levy and loan of goods in Sichuan Province this year. It was unanimously agreed to approve the levy and loan of 4.5 million shi (unit of dry volume) in the city of Sichuan Province this year and resolved to fully assist in promoting it to ensure its smooth completion. However, with regard to the more than 2.3 million shi of market stone owed by the central government in treasury bills and interest, the Executive Yuan has clearly ordered its return to the people. Since this year's levy and loan has been promulgated, it should be allowed to be deducted from the levy amount by the people, as an expression of good faith, in accordance with the Yuan's order. Also, the 1.35 million shi of public grain in the province and counties should be properly allocated by the provincial government from the levy and loan amount, and past debts should be effectively recovered to make up for shortfalls and achieve a balance of income and expenditure. The additional levy should be waived to lay the foundation for provincial and county finances, the levy and loan amount should be verified and allocated, no additional share should be made, and long-standing malpractices should be eliminated to improve grain administration and be transferred for implementation."

### Xuzhou City Old Yellow River Silting Up, City Government Asks for Funds for Dredging

[Our Xuzhou Report] The old Yellow River in this city has been silted up for a long time. A few days ago, there was heavy rain, and the mountain torrents upstream burst, causing the river to rise suddenly. Fortunately, the military and civilians worked hard to block the floods, which stabilized. Now, in order to prevent problems, the city government decided to thoroughly dredge the river. It has ordered the responsible department of the Public Works Bureau to investigate and estimate the amount of dredging needed, which is 1,520,000 cubic meters of earthwork, 2,625 cubic meters of revetment stone, and 1,000 revetment wooden piles, with a total cost of 3,100,162,500 yuan.

### Communist Male and Female Spies Infiltrate the Southern Section of the Jinpu Railway

[Special Correspondence from this Newspaper in Bengbu] Since the Communist army launched an offensive toward northern Jiangsu, Communist spies lurking in the southern section of the Jinpu Railway have seized the opportunity to become active, attempting to sabotage transportation and carry out assassination plots. It is learned that the 5th Division of the New Fourth Army recently dispatched more than 40 male and female spies from eastern Hubei. The male spies disguise themselves as cobblers, while the female spies disguise themselves as prostitutes, and are active in the area from southern Henan to northern Anhui. The action team members dispatched by Chen Yusheng of the Communist army's independent brigade mostly disguise themselves as bricklayers and peddlers, lurking along the Beijing-Shanghai railway line. The Communist army in the southern section of the Jinpu Railway, using the name of the Lifeng Company, has dispatched many secret agents disguised as pig traders to purchase military supplies.

A New Twist in the Lixin Labor Strike

At the Lixin Textile Factory under Wuqiao in this city, all the workers, in order to demand higher wages, profit sharing, and shorter working hours, and dissatisfied with the factory's welfare facilities, started a work slowdown on the 30th of last month. Representatives were repeatedly dispatched to make demands to the management, and relevant authorities mediated, but because the opinions of the two sides differed too greatly, the issue has not yet been resolved. On the 2nd, personnel from a certain agency went to the Lixin Factory to investigate, and because they were carrying foreign handcuffs, the workers, seeing this, suspected that they were going to use force to arrest workers, which caused a misunderstanding and another disturbance. More than 600 female workers gathered and went in a group to the Shigu River Cotton Textile Industry Workers' Union to report. The union sent personnel to the county government to inquire about the truth, saying that there was no such thing. After repeated explanations, they returned in a group. Although the Qingfeng Yarn Factory labor strike was resumed on the 29th of last month, the agreement reached by labor and management has not yet been fully implemented.

Editorial

### The Iran Issue Resurfaces

When Sir Samuel, the Indian representative, delivered a speech at the Paris Peace Conference, expressing concern about peace in the Middle East, British troops suddenly sailed from India to Basra, Iraq, to reinforce and protect British interests in southern Iran. The Iranian government believes that this move by Britain is tantamount to interfering in the country's internal affairs and has protested to the London authorities. The precarious situation in the Middle East, which had been stabilized for several months, has therefore become tense again.

In the Middle East, after the end of the victorious war, the intricate internal and foreign affairs of Iran have repeatedly caused international uproar and almost led to disaster. Fortunately, the countries concerned, especially the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, were able to tolerate each other, and the Iranian government painstakingly eliminated domestic differences, which resulted in temporary tranquility. However, the international environment of Iran remains the same, but "open struggles" have been replaced by "covert struggles." In other words, although the Iranian issue has ostensibly been compromised, the "struggle" between Britain and the Soviet Union in Iran has not actually stopped, but has intensified. Judging from the political situation in Iran in recent months, Iran's politics do have a tendency to lean more toward the Soviet Union. Iranian Prime Minister Saed, though trying his best to remain detached and lead the people in organizing the Democratic Party to compete with the pro-Soviet Tudeh Party, his power is still insufficient to resist the Tudeh Party's deep penetration into the people, everywhere inciting anti-British sentiments among the Iranian people. As a result, a large-scale strike broke out in the oil field area of southern Iran on the 15th of last month, not only paralyzing the production of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, but also seriously threatening British interests in southern Iran. Because the local authorities had to maintain order among the 100,000 striking workers, they declared a state of emergency as a precaution; the striking workers, on the contrary, demanded the resignation of Governor Fatemi on the charge of being a "tool of the British." From this, it can be seen that the oil strike is by no means a simple strike, and it has an international background. For the sake of settling the situation, the Iranian government instructed Governor Fatemi to avoid conflicts with the striking workers, and this conciliatory attitude naturally had its unspeakable pain. The British authorities, seeing that the country's interests were not guaranteed, in addition to negotiating with the Iranian government, requesting it to immediately take emergency measures to protect the lives and property of British and Indian people in the south, also sent three naval vessels into the Persian Gulf, anchored outside the port of Abadan, to indicate that if British interests in southern Iran were threatened, they could take action at any time. At the same time, British Foreign Secretary Bevin also stated in the House of Commons that Iran should be fully responsible for the safety of British citizens within its borders. At that time, the situation was indeed tense for a time; but the events in Palestine suddenly occurred at this time, forcing Britain to shift its attention to the Palestinian issue, and the Iranian issue formed a situation of outward relaxation and inward tension.

During these two weeks of surface silence, the Iranian political situation took a sharp turn for the worse. The Democratic Party led by Prime Minister Saed and the pro-Soviet Tudeh Party reached a temporary understanding. The Iranian cabinet resigned en masse at the end of last month, so that Prime Minister Saed could reorganize a new cabinet, which was completed on the 1st of this month. Three members of the left-wing pro-Soviet Tudeh Party joined the new cabinet, and the cabinet was evenly divided between the "pro-Soviet faction" and the "pro-British faction." The reorganization of the Iranian cabinet is obviously unfavorable to Britain, and it goes without saying that the British government feels that the safety of British people in southern Iran is not guaranteed, and they have no choice but to take military action to protect their own interests.

Iran has protested to the British government over the concentration of British troops in Iraq. If this matter were purely a dispute between Britain and Iran, there would be no need to be alarmist and say that the situation in the Middle East is becoming tense again. But behind the British-Iranian conflict, there is also a powerful country, which is the neighboring Soviet Union in the north. It will never let go of Iran, and as the situation develops to the present, the Soviet Union's power in Iran has taken deep root, and Britain will not be its strong enemy. Recently, the Soviet diplomats also held three winning cards in their hands: (1) Princess Pari of Iran, the younger sister of the Iranian King, recently visited Moscow, and the Soviet government showed great hospitality and did everything possible to make contact; (2) The political advisor to Iranian Prime Minister Saed, who is also the spokesman for the Iranian government, Prince Firouz, as a representative of the pro-Soviet faction in the Iranian cabinet, personally went to southern Iran and released the arrested workers; (3) The pro-Soviet Tudeh Party has recently strengthened its propaganda offensive and also occupies three seats in the new cabinet, its position is becoming more and more consolidated, which is completely different from half a year ago.

On the British side, its influence in Iran is weakening day by day, and the tools it can rely on are also becoming less and less. Coupled with the troubles of the Palestinian issue, Britain is in a dilemma in Iran. Britain has already decided not to maintain its oil rights in Iran, otherwise it has no choice but to take severe measures. The British Labor government is reluctant to give up Palestine, and that is why. Churchill criticized the Labor government's Palestine policy, saying that it was abandoning the elephant to take the rat, which is very pertinent; but in the current international environment, if Britain wants to consolidate its position in the Middle East, even if the elephant is abandoned, the rat must still be contested.

In short, the "diplomatic war" between Britain and the Soviet Union in the Middle East has reached a fever pitch. Iran has a reputation as the powder keg of the Middle East. Since British troops have been concentrated in the area closest to the Iraqi-Iranian border, and there are also rumors that Iranian troops are moving south, coupled with the Soviet Union pulling the strings behind the scenes, with everyone playing with fire next to the powder keg, who can guarantee that it will not start a prairie fire? The bells of peace have been ringing constantly in Paris, and the political diplomats of 21 countries are now gathered in Paris. To prevent the recurrence of war, they should first put out this "spark" in the Middle East!

### The Paris Peace Conference Adjourned for One Day Yesterday; Representatives Engaged in Extracurricular Activities; Britain Proposed a Compromise on the Voting System Issue

[News from this Newspaper] Paris, 4th Broadcast: Today is Sunday, and the Peace Conference is adjourned for one day, but the contact between the representatives outside the conference is frequent, and the voting issue is receiving the most attention from all parties. It is heard that the British side has proposed a compromise plan, the details of which are unknown, and the issue will likely be decided in the beginning of next week. According to general opinion, the major powers will have an advantage with a majority of eleven to ten.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 3rd Dispatch] The importance of the matters to be discussed by the Rules Committee of the Peace Conference can be seen from the fact that the plenary session has been postponed to wait for the committee to complete its work. The committee is scheduled to reconvene on the morning and afternoon of the 5th of this month to discuss the issue of the majority required for voting on important matters. Regarding this matter, the four powers still believe that procedural matters can be passed by a simple majority vote of the plenary session, while other matters and suggestions must be passed by a two-thirds majority. The Brazilian representative once proposed that all motions and proposals should be passed by a simple majority vote, and the New Zealand representative also made a similar proposal. The British representative proposed a compromise plan to divide all proposals into two categories, some of which can be passed by a simple majority vote, while others must be passed by a two-thirds majority. All of these should be submitted to the Rules Committee for discussion. In addition, the committee should also discuss the voting procedures of various subcommittees. Regarding this level, the New Zealand representative has also submitted an amendment, arguing that all proposals passed by a simple majority of the subcommittee must be submitted to the plenary session for consideration. Political observers here believe that the above issues are extremely important and may cause lengthy debates.

[United Press, Paris, 3rd Dispatch] The major events of today's meeting are as follows: (1) The British representative declared that the four powers are expected to form a united front on all matters agreed upon in the draft peace treaty with the five countries. Although the Yugoslav representative fiercely criticized, the dispute over the port of Trieste will not be reopened. (2) The Canadian delegation announced that it will raise questions about the $10 billion reparations to the Soviet Union and will demand a thorough review of the situation. Australia also indicated that it will take the same action.

### Resolution of the Issue of the Chairman of the Peace Conference; Five Powers to Rotate the Chairmanship; Dutch Amendment Rejected

[Reuters, Paris, 3rd Dispatch] The Rules Committee of the Peace Conference, after four and a half hours of discussion this afternoon, without a vote, agreed to the proposal of the foreign ministers of the four powers, and decided that the chairman of the conference would be rotated by the five powers: China, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France. Earlier, the Dutch representative suggested that the conference should freely elect the chairman, which was rejected by a vote of twelve to eight. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes said in today's debate that he felt that discussing the peace treaty proposals was more important than who chaired the conference. The Rules Committee voted in favor of the Dutch amendment by Brazil, Australia, Belgium, Greece, India, New Zealand, South Africa, and the Netherlands. Those who opposed were the United States, Britain, Norway, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Ukraine, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia. Abyssinia abstained.

### Interlude at the Peace Conference; Movie Camera Tumbles; Foreign Minister Wang Nearly Injured

[Central News Agency, Paris, 3rd Special Dispatch] My country's chief representative Wang Shijie was nearly injured today, because a huge movie camera next to him fell and hit Lin Xianrang, an observer sitting behind Wang on the Rules Committee, and his left ear was slightly injured. However, the photographer was unintentional and was quite shocked.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 3rd Special Dispatch] When the Rules Committee of the Peace Conference met today to discuss the issue of the Chairman of the Conference, China supported the rules proposed by the four powers, that is, the five member states of the Council of Foreign Ministers would take turns as Chairman. When Wang Shijie explained the reason for China's support for this rule, he said that it was based on factual reasons. In principle, China supported the Dutch amendment, that is, the conference had the right to elect its own Chairman. However, considering the actual situation, if the amendment was passed, it would cause new and complex problems and would not allow the work of the conference to proceed smoothly. The amendment is still under consideration, and after the final decision, the Chinese delegation will support the proposal made by the Council of Foreign Ministers on this matter based on this practical reason, and only for this reason. Wang said finally that China did not participate in the preparation of this proposal by the Council of Foreign Ministers.

### Chinese Should Be Listed as an Official Language of the Peace Conference; My Representative Guo Taiqi Proposed

[Central News Agency, Paris, 3rd Special Dispatch] At the meeting of the Rules Committee this morning, my country's delegation submitted a reservation on the issue of the rules for the adoption of official languages by the Paris Peace Conference. Article 4 of the procedural rules drafted by the four countries last month stated that "English, French, and Russian are the official and applicable languages in all plenary and committee meetings." During the discussion today, Guo Taiqi, a representative of my country, said that according to the United Nations Charter, Chinese is one of the five official languages. In the Council of Foreign Ministers meeting held in London last September, it was also agreed that important resolutions and documents should be translated into Chinese and distributed to various delegations. This method does not cost the conference extra time. In view of various technical difficulties, the Chinese delegation does not require the Paris Peace Conference to follow the above methods, but hopes to put this matter on record, that is, China does expect that in future meetings, especially the Far East Peace Conference dealing with Japan, Chinese will be listed as one of the official languages.

### Strict Security Around the Luxembourg Palace; French Soldiers Climb to the Rooftop for Day and Night Watch; Food Eaten by Representatives Is Inspected

[Reuters, Paris, 3rd Dispatch] Before each meeting of the Paris Peace Conference, French assault troops climb to the roof of the Luxembourg Palace for strict security. If they find suspicious persons, they are allowed to shoot before questioning them. The food eaten by the delegates to the conference is inspected in advance. There are three security police in each of the twenty hotels where the delegates reside, whose special duty is to check the items delivered to the delegates to prevent explosive devices, etc. Employees of the conference venue and hotel staff have been closely investigated by the police. Nazis are suspended from their duties during the conference. Special colored passes are issued to those related to the conference, with different colors every day, to prevent others from impersonating them. The security matters of the conference are the responsibility of Andre, the Secretary General of the French Security Police.

### British Troops Gather in Iraq; Iranian Government Protests

Accusing Britain of Interfering in Its Internal Affairs

[Reuters, New Delhi, 3rd Dispatch] It is announced here today: The Iranian government has obviously failed to maintain the law and order in the Anglo-Iranian oil region. The lives and properties of Indians and British, and the supply of gasoline to India are all threatened. Therefore, troops have been transferred from India to Basra, Iraq.

[Agence France-Presse, Tehran, 3rd Dispatch] The government has just announced: The Iranian government protested today against the British concentration of troops in Iraq. According to a bulletin issued by the propaganda department, the Iranian government protested against the British troop concentration in Basra in accordance with the provisions of the United Nations Charter and the Anglo-Iranian-Soviet tripartite treaty. According to a communique issued in New Delhi, the British troop concentration is intended to maintain security in southern Iran. The Iranian government will reiterate its protest against this interference in Iranian internal affairs.

[Agence France-Presse, Tehran, 3rd Dispatch] Well-informed sources here recently said: News of the British troop concentration in the port of Basra in Iraq has greatly shocked Iran. Diplomatic observers believe that the organization of a new cabinet in Iran, which includes the pro-Soviet Labor Party (i.e., the Tudeh Party), is the reason for the British government's drastic measures, which aims to prevent anti-British propaganda movements in southern Iran, which is also the location of British economic interests. A certain left-wing newspaper here said that the British action interfered in Iranian internal affairs and threatened Iranian sovereignty. The Iranian government will appeal to the United Nations.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 3rd Dispatch] A spokesperson for the Foreign Office told a reporter from Agence France-Presse that people here are not surprised by the development of the situation in the Middle East. British troops from India are heading to Iraq because disputes broke out in southern Iran half a month ago, and precautionary measures had to be taken to avoid the recurrence of similar events. This troop movement was decided one day after the Abadan city strike. This decision was kept secret for military reasons. In short, London is quite calm about the situation. In addition, a diplomatic reporter for the Daily 　　reported that the British 　　　Iraq has made the situation very tense, and all parties concerned are extremely anxious.

### Italian Fleet: Rather Scuttled; British and American Delegations Receive Warning; Italian Foreign Minister Goes to Paris

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] London, 4th Broadcast: The Italian Foreign Minister departed Rome for Paris today.

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 4th Dispatch] Several newspapers this morning carried "Italian Fleet to Be Scuttled" as their top headline. According to these newspapers, the British and American delegations to the Paris Peace Conference have received a warning that Italian sailors would rather scuttle their own fleet than hand it over to other countries.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 3rd Dispatch] Italian Deputy Prime Minister Nenni has completed discussions with French and other countries' politicians and will return to Rome on the 5th of this month. Regarding this matter, well-informed sources recently stated that Nenni will also meet with the Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister, who is the head of that country's delegation, Mr. Kardelj, although this has not been officially confirmed. Although the details of their meeting are not known to outsiders, it is said that they exchanged opinions and emphasized that although some politicians on both sides hope to foster friendly relations, due to border disputes, the general public on both sides are opposed, making it impossible to achieve at present.

### Turkish Cabinet Resigns En Masse

Defense Minister Ordered to Form a Cabinet

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] San Francisco, 4th Broadcast: The Defense Minister has been ordered to form a new cabinet.

### Anglo-Soviet Contest in the Middle East: A New Page Unfolds in Diplomatic Warfare

[Agence France-Presse, London, 3rd Dispatch] The British government has announced the dispatch of troops to Iraq, and the diplomatic war being waged by Britain and the Soviet Union in Tehran has opened a new chapter. London and Moscow are unwilling to compromise on the competition between the two countries in the Middle East. British Foreign Secretary Bevin, in his report to the House of Commons on July 17, did not publicly mention the pro-Soviet elements in southern Iran holding demonstrations to oppose the Anglo-Iranian oil companies, and for this reason. Moscow also avoids formally supporting the Tudeh Party, also for this reason. In fact, both sides are secretly putting pressure on the Iranian government, forcing it to declare that it is neither pro-British nor pro-Soviet. British and Soviet diplomats are engaged in a battle of wits with Iranian Prime Minister Sa'ed, each wanting to show their skills. On the Soviet side, they hold three winning cards: (1) Princess Pari-Visha, the Iranian King's younger sister, recently visited Moscow, and the Soviet government gave her a warm reception; (2) Prince Firouz, the political advisor and spokesman for Prime Minister Sa'ed, is a pro-Soviet representative in the Iranian cabinet and personally went to Abadan to release the arrested workers; (3) The Tudeh Party is strengthening its propaganda work, and its position in the cabinet is becoming more consolidated. On the British side, there are also three things to say: (1) Foreign Secretary Bevin declared that the Iranian government is fully responsible for the safety of British citizens within its borders; (2) The British cruiser "Norfolk" sailed to the Persian Gulf; (3) Troops were sent to reinforce areas near the border between Iraq and Iran.

### The Soviet Union Launches Another Propaganda Offensive Against the United States

[Central News Agency, London, 3rd, United Press] Relations between the Soviet Union and Western countries seem to be approaching a new crisis today, as the Soviet Union has launched another propaganda attack against the United States. The Kremlin officially criticized the United States, saying, "The United States has formally established a new military class to control the atomic bomb and build a powerful armed force for offensive purposes." It also said, "The schemes of the reactionary governments of the West" have threatened the Paris Peace Conference, and all the industrial machinery in the American-occupied zone of Germany, which should have been used to compensate the Soviet Union according to the Potsdam Agreement, has been destroyed by the American side. The famous Soviet radio commentator, Lanski, promoted, "We should remember that the United States is now, for the first time in history, maintaining a large army, navy, air force, and atomic bombs in peacetime for offensive purposes. The purpose of the United States in manufacturing atomic bombs is certainly not for self-defense."

### The United States Attaches Great Importance to the Economic Aspects of the Peace Conference

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Paris, 4th Broadcast: US Undersecretary of State Clayton delivered a radio address today, stating that since the end of the war, the United States has spent $200 billion to help revive foreign economies, which shows how much Americans value the economic aspects of the peace treaty. Countries that have suffered aggression have the inherent right to demand compensation from the aggressors, but the aggressors' ability to compensate should also be taken into account. In short, we cannot repeat the mistakes of the Treaty of Versailles.

### The United States Invites Representatives from Eleven Countries to Discuss the Issue of Japanese Reparations

[Remodeling Society, Tokyo, 4th Dispatch] According to Washington, the US government has decided to convene a meeting of representatives from the eleven countries participating in the Far Eastern Commission, starting on the 15th, to discuss the issue of Japanese reparations. It is said that the invitations have been sent out. In the invitation, the US government emphasized that Japan's surrender is approaching its first anniversary, but the research work on the reparations issue has made no progress. It also stated that because it is not known what industries each country will allow Japan to retain, the work of dismantling Japanese economic equipment has been greatly delayed. The representatives of the eleven countries of the Far Eastern Commission should keep this proposal of the United States confidential before deciding on its implementation. It is speculated that the intention of the US government is, first, to have the United Nations recognize the distribution of Japanese military factories, and second, to resolve the entanglement of the Soviet Union's reparations issues in the Northeast as soon as possible. It is said that the American note to the eleven countries proposes that the method of determining reparations should take into account the Soviet Union's dismantling of industrial facilities in the Northeast. If the amount of compensation to be received by each country is determined according to the US proposal, the value of the Northeastern industrial facilities dismantled by the Soviet Union may be deducted from the amount of compensation to be received by the Soviet Union. According to well-informed sources in American diplomatic circles, the Soviet Union will vehemently oppose this, because Moscow has consistently insisted that these industrial facilities should not be used for general compensation, but are their "war trophies." Former US reparations envoy Pauley estimated that the Northeastern industrial facilities dismantled by the Soviet Union were worth approximately US$2 billion. Furthermore, the reparations conference for Japan will be held in the United States, and all resolutions of the reparations conference in the future will still need to be endorsed by the Far Eastern Commission.

### MacArthur Issues Report Describing Korean Developments

[United Press, Tokyo, 3rd Dispatch] General MacArthur recently issued a report on the developments of the US military government in Korea, stating that as a result of the breakdown of US-Soviet negotiations, "the continued existence of the US military government is increasingly needed." Since the breakdown of negotiations, there has been public discussion among civilians about the possibility of forming a separate provisional government in South Korea. Later, this discussion gradually subsided. The report continued, "The people of South Korea are very disappointed with the changes in the political situation, but they express gratitude for the United States' support for Korean independence." Subsequently, it listed the important developments in May: (1) The establishment of several new political groups. (2) The promulgation of a law prohibiting the sale of women. (3) The holding of the May Day celebration ceremony. (4) The continued improvement of police administration.

It is reported that Albania has selected Chekov as its representative to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 3rd Dispatch] The Greek Ambassador to the United States and Representative to the United Nations General Assembly, Dytramis, recently met with a reporter from the New York Times and stated that the Greek government believes that Albania has no right to claim that it is a friendly and peaceful country, and therefore objects to Albania's request to join the United Nations organization.

[United Press, Washington, 4th Dispatch] Portuguese Ambassador to the United States Bissi-Cherchi stated here today that Portugal's formal application to join the United Nations organization as a member state has been submitted to the acting Secretary-General of the United Nations organization, and Portugal is prepared to accept all the obligations of the United Nations Charter.

[Agence France-Presse, Geneva, 3rd Dispatch] UNRRA Director LaGuardia will arrive here by special plane with his wife, expected to arrive tomorrow morning. The Swiss government is prepared to welcome them.

### The United States Plans to Form a National Defense Guard Corps to Deal with Atomic Age Tactics; Atomic Warhead Rockets Are Already Being Manufactured

[United Press, Washington, 3rd Dispatch] The US Army is currently planning the largest national defense guard corps in history to be ready at any time to deal with enemy airborne troops in the atomic age.

### Anniversary of Victory Over Japan: The United States to Commemorate Solemnly

[United Press, Washington, 3rd Dispatch] Americans will commemorate the first anniversary of Japan's surrender on August 14. That day has been declared by President Truman as Victory Remembrance Day, and the entire country should hold solemn commemorative ceremonies to commemorate the great sacrifices made by men and women across the country to achieve victory, so as not to forget.

### US Federal Reserve Discusses Inflation

[United Press, Washington, 3rd Dispatch] The Federal Reserve Board discussed the issue of inflation in a special publication, acknowledging that the rise in prices in the United States is a clear sign of inflation, but denying that the "astronomical" inflation that occurred in continental Europe is likely to occur in the United States. The report stated: "We have no reason to fear that such inflation will occur in the United States, because this type of inflation is caused by excessive issuance of currency leading to budget deficits. "The sharp reduction in office expenses, the maintenance of high wartime tax rates, and the maintenance of low income tax deduction methods prove that the government has not lost the ability to control the financial situation, and there is absolutely no danger of having to increase currency."

### Paris Telegraph Workers: Resumed Work Yesterday

[Reuters, Paris, 3rd Dispatch] The National Strike Committee announced tonight that after consultation with the Minister of Finance, the workers of the National Central Telephone and Telegraph Bureau have scheduled to resume work tomorrow, and the workers' demands have been accepted by the Ministry of Finance.

### In the Midst of a Long Congressional Recess in the United States: A Review of General Political Achievements; Wide Rifts with the President on Domestic Affairs

[Central News Agency, Washington, 3rd Special Dispatch] The 79th US Congress ended its session yesterday, and all members of Congress are resting today. Many government-deemed "necessary bills" remain to be resolved by the next Congress, such as the unification of the armed forces, compulsory military training, and labor control bills, which must be re-submitted in January next year and go through troublesome procedures such as committee review and debate.

[Central News Agency, New York, 3rd Special Dispatch] Unless the President calls a special session, the 79th US Congress has become a historical relic. That Congress has a record of cooperating with two presidents (Roosevelt and Truman) on wartime issues, and of fierce conflicts with two presidents on major domestic issues. The New York Times summarized the achievements of that Congress, believing that it was very successful in dealing with the war and its international consequences, but after the end of the war, it seemed to lack a definite sense of purpose. From an international perspective, the newspaper believes that the most regrettable thing is that Congress failed to stipulate peacetime military training and the urgently needed unification of the armed forces, thereby weakening the military position of the United States. Political observers are equally disappointed that Congress failed to pass three administrative bills that would increase America's position in world power politics and maintain US defense. One of the three bills is to authorize the President to assist in training and equipping one million Chinese troops.

[United Press, Washington, 4th Dispatch] The 79th US Congress, known as the "Victory Congress" of World War II, after experiencing 20 months of war and peace, finally announced its adjournment tonight, and spent its longest congressional recess in eight years. Before the new Congress reconvenes in January next year, members of Congress hope that the results of the November elections can indicate whether a majority of American voters agree with the achievements they have made in the past two years. During its session, Congress supported the government's international cooperation plan in the following areas: (1) Ratification of the 1944 Bretton Woods monetary agreement. (2) Approval of a loan of US$3.75 billion to Britain. (3) Allocating huge sums of money to UNRRA. (4) Implementing the United Nations Charter and cooperating with various countries to exchange agricultural, educational, and scientific information.

### An Assassin Who Planned to Murder Truman Was Apprehended

He Is a Mental Patient

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] San Francisco, 4th Broadcast: The US Secret Service revealed today that a person who claimed to want to assassinate President Truman has been apprehended and will be tried soon. There have been many such cases. The above-mentioned person is the most recently arrested. These people are all mentally disturbed. Officials were unable to state who this suspect was, and the report did not mention where the incident occurred. It is only known that this suspect has committed many crimes and has been treated in a mental hospital three times.

### Tokyo Restaurants Close: Overseas Chinese Restaurants Are Full

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd Special Dispatch] 16,000 Japanese restaurants have closed in opposition to price controls, so the business of approximately 3,000 restaurants opened by overseas Chinese here has doubled in the past three days. The closure of the cafeterias set up by the Japanese is obviously intended to force the Japanese government to reconsider its decision. A large number of people and urban workers in Tokyo rely on these cafeterias for their livelihoods.

### Mussolini's Corpse: Still Missing

[United Press, Rome, 4th Dispatch] According to the Italian Ansa news agency, the Milan Police Department issued a communiqué stating that four perpetrators who recently stole Mussolini's body from a public cemetery have been arrested and confessed to the theft. However, others have moved the body to another unknown location. The leader of the corpse thieves, named Nahas, is a neo-fascist who has been apprehended for a long time. The remaining three perpetrators were arrested in the past few days.

### Southern Traitors Sentenced to Death

[Reuters, Belgrade, 3rd Dispatch] Cardinal Rabi, Cardinal Stoja, and Cardinal Kovacevic, who held important positions in the Serbian puppet government, have been sentenced to death by the military court here.

### Muslim Spiritual Leader Delivers Speech: Advocates Organizing a Central Common Peace Mechanism; Views Us as an Honorary Partner of the Anglo-American Federation

[Reuters, Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, 3rd Dispatch] The Muslim spiritual leader, Aga Khan, gave a speech here tonight, advocating that Britain and its dominions unite with the United States as a central mechanism for leading human cooperation. The people of Britain, the United States, and the dominions should not be regarded as foreigners, but as siblings. The paper guarantees of the United Nations organization, no matter how perfect, are like fortresses built on sand if there is no common peace policy, how can one expect them to last? If the world federation of Britain, America, Ireland, Canada, Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand has a permanent common peace policy and is determined to stop aggression, other peaceful countries in the world will naturally flock to this powerful central organization. Muslim countries need not have any other foreign policy or ambition, but only need to join this central peace mechanism. France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and the Scandinavian countries will never be creators of aggression. China will be an honorary partner of the Anglo-American Federation. Germany, Italy, and Japan have learned their lesson and will be happy to participate. Furthermore, if India and the colonies of Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Portugal are merely plantations for so-called protectorates, they will eventually become a source of trouble or lead to misunderstandings between Britain and the United States. One-quarter of the world's population, occupying one-third of the world's richest land, cannot be permanently subjected to control, no matter how much sugar-coated lotus root slices are given. Political knowledge must be given to them so that they can become pillars of peace, not places of bloodshed. The first step is to establish a government that the people are satisfied with, and the profitable plantation-owning countries must also share their monopolistic commercial interests with the world. In such a world, surrounded by truly peace-loving countries, the Soviet Union must also feel satisfied. After World War I, countries recognized the many drawbacks of the lack of organization in the world, and the League of Nations was established. I represented India at the disarmament conference from 1931 to 1938. I personally had great hopes for the League of Nations, but the League of Nations was merely a name for maintaining peace, and had no power to maintain peace, so the Second World War occurred. All these things are in the past, but if we do not mend the fold after losing the sheep, history will surely repeat itself.

### The Former Residence of the Great American Writer Mark Twain (Part 1)

— A dispatch from our special correspondent in the United States, Mao Shuqing, from Norcheng

[Airmail dispatch dated July 12th] On the morning of my fourth day in Kansas, I received a telegram from Mr. Entehe of the State Department's News Bureau, essentially saying that the Tennessee Valley Authority had been contacted and I should proceed there immediately. My original plan to continue westward to the Rocky Mountains had to be temporarily abandoned, so that afternoon, I turned eastward. On the way back east, I stopped for a night in Hanniba, a small city of 10,000 people on the banks of the Mississippi River. Across the river is Illinois, while Hanniba itself belongs to Missouri. The city has many large hotels, specifically for accommodating tourists. Why do tourists come? Because it is the hometown of the great 19th-century American writer Mark Twain. Twain (Mark is his first name) was born in Hanniba in 1835. At that time, American civilization was still in its early stages. In the mid-19th century, the United States was on the path of industrialization, producing many famous scientists and inventors. However, in literature, the United States had always been dependent on Europe, with few outstanding talents. Mark Twain was almost a "unique" product. In Hanniba, I paid my respects to Twain's wooden cottage, where he had enjoyed his childhood and later years. The cottage is made of simple wooden planks and still retains its original appearance. To the left of the house is a garden facing the street, with lawns and plaster statues, said to be the place where Twain "conceived" his ideas. The cottage is a two-story building. Downstairs are the guest room and kitchen, displaying old-fashioned Mobil kerosene lamps, candles, and the teapot Twain used when writing. The kitchen has a very old-fashioned coal stove, and many Chinese and Western porcelain items. Upstairs is the bedroom, with antique sofas and clothes hanging on the clothes rack. Twain celebrated his 70th birthday in Hanniba on December 5, 1905, a famous event. He died in 1910. Later, the cottage was bought by George Mahan. In May 1912, the Mahans decided to donate it to the city government of Hanniba to commemorate the great writer. To the right of the cottage is the Hanniba Municipal Museum, which mostly displays Twain's works, manuscripts, and letters.

Twain's famous play "Joan of Arc" was written upstairs in a grocery store not far from his home. What was this grocery store used for in those days? A monument to Twain's creative work stands in front of the store. Mark Twain's most famous work, "Tom Sawyer," tells a story of an innocent childhood and its romance. Becky Thatcher, Tom's first love in the book, refers to a girl who lived across from Twain's house. This charming young girl from a century ago did not leave any traces in history. Today, the Thatcher family's wooden house still exists. Smart businessmen have converted it into a "Traveler's Lodge," specifically to attract Americans with a fondness for antiquity to spend a nostalgic night there. In China, Mark Twain's works may not be widely introduced. However, in Europe and the United States, some people call him the American Shakespeare. Sixteen years after Twain's death, American radio began broadcasting his works. Twain's plays were staged in New York, and The New York Times devoted an entire page to introduce them. The Hanniba Museum displays every publication and manuscript related to Mark Twain. There is a book chronicling Twain's life called "Son of Missouri—Mark Twain." There is also a book written by the Frenchman Wito, titled "Mark Twain's America." Hanniba is a small city, and shops, hotels, restaurants, and theaters all use Mark Twain's name to attract tourists. The city has parks, and there are musical performances on summer nights.

The life of residents in small American cities is very interesting. They know how to arrange a "human" life. As I strolled down the street, many people looked at me with curiosity. I knew that many Americans in small cities had never seen a person of color before. On the morning of my departure from Hanniba, I took a walk in "Wangjiang Park" by the Mississippi River. There is a bronze statue of Mark Twain there, like a giant, towering above the torrents of the Mississippi. Twenty miles north across the river from Hanniba is a medium-sized city in Illinois called "Quincy." I quickly toured the streets of Quincy for a week, but I didn't have time to stay. Consul Shen Zuogan told me a story about Quincy: There was a overseas Chinese man named Huang Sanmei who had been doing business in the United States for a long time and had accumulated some wealth. This gentleman liked to express his opinions on national affairs. After the start of the War of Resistance, he offered a reward of three thousand US dollars to the first hero to bomb Tokyo. Later, when General Doolittle bombed Tokyo, he indeed wired three thousand dollars to Mrs. Doolittle.

Mrs. Doolittle

returned it intact, saying, "Soldiers are performing their duties for the country and cannot accept any private rewards." Huang Sanmei was in a dilemma, and finally came up with a solution: he bought a Chinese antique vase and sent it to the Doolittle's home. That was one incident. The second story is: On one occasion, Huang Sanmei suddenly had a "whim" and wrote to the Chinese government, suggesting that students be sent to the United States to study a certain science, with all tuition fees borne by him. It is said that the education authorities actually believed this and specially selected four students to come to the United States. As soon as the students arrived, Huang Sanmei suddenly changed his mind, claiming that he was "unwilling to pay this expense," causing the embassy and consulates great difficulty. The total cost of the four students studying for three years was about ten thousand US dollars. The embassy asked people in many ways for the reason, but he ignored it and instead asked a foreigner to reply to the embassy, saying that the Chinese government was "undemocratic" and that he was unwilling to bear the cost. The embassy had asked him to respond to why he wrote letters irresponsibly in the first place? Later, other overseas Chinese came out to dissuade them, saying, "Huang is simply a madman, why pursue it any further?" What was the outcome of this strange case? It is not yet known. Has the money been settled? I also don't have time to investigate. I passed through Quincy that day. Because of the urgency, I did not visit this strange overseas Chinese man, Mr. Huang Sanmei. It was midnight when I arrived in Chicago. I did not delay and took the train south the next day. The train passed through the large city of Bender in Indiana and the capital of Indiana, "Indianapolis." This road is all an endless plain. Geologists call the states of Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio in the Midwestern United States the "Black Soil Region," meaning that those states are the most affluent and suitable for farming. I changed trains in Cincinnati, a large city at the junction of the three states. South of Cincinnati is what Americans call the "South." The railway company is also called the "Southern Railway Company." The trains of the Southern Railway Company are the same as those in the North. The only big difference is that blacks and whites are seated separately. When entering the station, the station police check tickets and wave their hands, saying "left door" or "right door." This is where the oddity lies. I was assigned to enter through the right door, but I didn't think about the black and white distinction. Seeing that the train behind was crowded, I tried to run to the front. Just as I was about to step onto the train in front, I opened my eyes and saw that it was full of blacks. Knowing it was not good, I ran back to board the train behind. The white "conductor" on the train smiled at me. I remember listening to a friend who had lived in Louisiana (the South) for a long time telling a story in New York. The second day he went to the South, he saw that the toilets were divided into black and white. He thought that the Chinese were yellow, which side should he go into? After thinking for a long time, he stepped forward and asked a policeman. The policeman pointed his baton at the white toilet and said, "Of course, here!" Wang Wenjue, the chief writer of the Chicago Sanmin Morning Post, told me another similar story. Once, he went to the South. After the train passed a certain station, he saw that the whites were all leaving their seats. He thought they had reached their destination and got off the train. Therefore, he didn't mind. After a while, all the whites had left. Black men and women, supporting the old and leading the young, were getting more and more crowded. A train staff member walked up to him, leaned in and whispered, "Please move to the rear train." Because Wang had a lot of luggage, moving was troublesome, and because the Chinese were not used to those racial prejudices, he remained in his original seat. After a long time, the entire train was full of blacks. The shouting of black children gradually became noisy, and they even defecated and urinated on the seats in the car. Only then did he feel the stench and filth unbearable, not a human world, and he had no choice but to move to the rear train. The staff member on the train smiled and told him, "I told you a long time ago, didn't I?"

### Apprentice Kidnaps Master, Demands 20 Million. Victim Rescued in Chongming, Perpetrators Including Ren Qilang and Accomplices Arrested

[Reported by this newspaper] At 3 PM on the 31st of last month, a woman named Zhu Zhou reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station that her husband, Zhu Zhendao, had been tricked out by bandits posing as painters at 8:30 AM the previous day, never to return (on the previous day, Zhu received a phone call from an unknown person, saying that there was a house that needed painting, and they would come to discuss it on the morning of the 30th. When the time came, someone did come and he was tricked and kidnapped). At dusk, a person named Bao Shangqian came to Mrs. Zhu, claiming that Zhu Zhendao had been kidnapped by bandits, and a ransom of 20 million yuan was required, otherwise he would be killed. He hoped that she would find a way, and agreed to come again the next afternoon to discuss it. Mrs. Zhu asked Yu Fengxiang to negotiate a reduction in the ransom with the bandits, while Su led police officer Zhu Jian and police chief Huang Yulin and others to disguise themselves and wait near Zhu Zhendao's home (No. 1, Lane 1703, Beijing West Road). At about 9:40 PM that night, Bao Shangqian did come to negotiate, and he was arrested and taken to the station for interrogation. According to his confession, the case was orchestrated by Ren Qilang (the kidnapped person's apprentice, who had left the shop several years ago), who colluded with other bandits to kidnap him. Ren Qilang has now reduced the ransom to 6 million yuan, and agreed to meet at 5 AM on August 1 at the Jingxiu Nunnery in Yangjing, Pudong, to deliver the ransom. At midnight that night, the police disguised themselves and crossed the river to Pudong, waiting near the port. At about 6 AM the next morning, Ren Qilang did arrive as agreed, and he was captured and taken back to the branch office. According to his confession, the kidnapped person was tricked into going to Dashengchang Wharf in Yangshupu by his accomplices on the 30th under the pretext of painting the house, and hired a small boat to Chongming Xianghua Township Liuyi to hide him, but the exact address was unknown. It was agreed that after obtaining the ransom, they would go there to find him. Another accomplice, Yang Longqi, agreed to meet at the Bund Park at 12 noon on the 1st, and then go to Chongming together. The police officers took the arrested Ren to the Bund Park to wait at the appointed time. Before long, Yang Longqi came slowly and was immediately arrested. After individual interrogation, it was learned that the hostage was indeed hidden in Liuyi, Chongming. In order to quickly rescue the hostage, the police bureau immediately dispatched plainclothes police officer Zhu Jian overnight, leading police chief Huang Yulin and plainclothes police officers Zhao Yiqian, Zhao Jiren, Liu Shiyang, Yang Zhongmin, and Wang Huimin, along with an arrested bandit, to hire a boat to Baocheng Town, Chongming. Chen Hongxiang, who was watching the ticket on the boat, was arrested in the town. According to his confession, the hostage was hidden in Liuyi, but he did not know which house. They then hired a car to rush to Liuyi, which was a very remote place, bordering the Yangtze River to the south, with many diverging ports. The police officers and the local Baojia chiefs searched door to door. At 3 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd, they searched a thatched cottage in the west beach of Liuyi and rescued the hostage. The bandit Chen Hongxiang and the hostage Zhu Zhendao were taken back to Shanghai.

### Yang Wendao Case: Defense Lawyer Expresses Optimism; Wu Tiecheng Recently Sent a Letter of Comfort to Yang

[Reported by this newspaper] According to Tang Huai, Yang Wendao's defense lawyer, he believes that the outcome of Yang Wendao's case being remanded for retrial is extremely promising, and he firmly believes that the miscarriage of justice can be redressed, or even concluded in one court session. On the 23rd of last month, he submitted a defense petition to the High Court, stating: (1) A key piece of evidence in the case, a "physics textbook," was originally in English, but suddenly became Chinese. The book was hollowed out and used to hide a handgun. Therefore, "the book is used to prove the origin of the gun, but since the book does not match, the gun loses its attachment." (2) The original judgment's adoption of the confessions and performances of the co-defendant Ye Haisheng did not correspond to the true facts. "His confession was obtained through torture, and his performance was directed by the police." He also emphasized, "Recalling the time, the relationship between China and Japan was precarious, and the authorities in the concession felt a high degree of unease in spirit. Therefore, the police investigation became even more intensified, not hesitating to create a miscarriage of justice. For ten years, both spirit and body have suffered, and the material losses are incalculable."

Recently, the court subpoenaed eleven witnesses to be questioned, including: (1) Guo Qiming, the lawyer hired by the Shanghai Guangdong Fellow Association on behalf of Yang ten years ago; (2) Zhang Zhirang, the lawyer appointed by the court as Yang's pro bono defense lawyer at the time; (3) Zhang Shizhu, the police lawyer at the time; (4) Wei Ligong, the forensic doctor; (5) Li Mu, who lent the self-defense handgun to Yang Wendao; (6) Yang Jianzhong, Yang Wendao's cousin, who first reported Yang Wendao to the Japanese investigator as the perpetrator of the case; (7) Zhang Chen, a witness favorable to Yang Wendao, but it is said that he was arrested and killed by the Japanese military police during the Shanghai occupation; (8) Zeng Yuan, also known as Zeng Yuanjia, who reported to the Japanese with Yang Jianzhong; (9) Zheng Weimin, who claimed to be a Japanese named Hirayama Genichi, who insisted that Yang was the murderer, but it is said that he was shot by the authorities in Guangzhou when it was about to fall several years ago for acting as a traitor; (10) Clauso, a Western detective; (11) Chen Rongsheng, Yang Wendao's servant, who is not currently in Shanghai. According to Yang's family, Tan Zhen, who led the plainclothes Japanese police to arrest Yang Wendao, was not subpoenaed by the High Court, presumably an oversight. It is said that Wu Tiecheng recently sent a letter to Yang Wendao, expressing his comfort, because when the case occurred, Wu was the mayor of Shanghai. The Japanese wanted to create an incident and tortured Yang Wendao to falsely accuse Wu of masterminding it, but Yang never yielded.

### Issue of Returning Captured Yarn and Cloth: Trade Associations Appeal to Investigation Team

[Reported by this newspaper] This reporter recently interviewed the persons in charge of the Dyeing and Weaving, Cotton Yarn, and Cotton Cloth Trade Associations to inquire about the issue of returning captured yarn and cloth. According to them, when the investigation team for the takeover work first came to Shanghai, the three associations jointly submitted a document requesting the investigation and return of the surplus amount of yarn and cloth forcibly bought and sold by the enemy and puppets. When the investigation team invited the various industries for talks last week, the three industries again sent representatives to make statements in person, and prepared a document to provide information, suggesting that the investigation team review the minutes of previous meetings of the Enemy Property Handling Review Committee and investigate the handling of the captured yarn and cloth in detail, including how much was sold and how much was extracted from the victimized factories (because the puppet Merchant's Association did not extract and deposit it in the original factories). More than eight out of ten of the 4,500 victimized factories entrusted the associations to strive for the return of the yarn and cloth from the government after the victory. The victimized businesses now hold fixed-term deposit certificates from the puppet Central Reserve Bank issued after the forced purchase and sale by the puppet Merchant's Association. Until the victory, one-quarter of the price had not yet been paid. According to the association's investigation, the amount of captured yarn and cloth is 2 million bolts of cloth and more than 10,000 bales of yarn, which happens to be one-quarter of the total amount purchased and sold. If valued at the current market price, it should be more than 160 trillion yuan. If handled according to the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau's method, each bolt of cloth would only need to be issued 4 jiao 6 fen 8 li in legal currency, because it is based on the price set by the enemy and puppets at the time of the forced purchase and sale, converted from puppet currency at a ratio of 200 to 1. If issued according to this number, it would be almost ridiculous. Therefore, businesses are vehemently opposed to this method. After the investigation team arrived in Shanghai, the principals who entrusted the associations urged the associations to argue their case according to reason in order to obtain the return of the yarn and cloth, but it is said that the associations do not insist on the estimated value of 160 billion yuan. It is also understood that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Industrial Association, and representatives from various industries will organize a petitioning delegation to Nanjing. The three associations also plan to send representatives to Nanjing to appeal to the highest authorities.

### Charity Sale at Bathhouses Raises Nearly 20 Million

The Shanghai Fundraising Committee of the Subei Refugee Relief Association held its second preparatory meeting at the association yesterday afternoon at 4 PM to elect "Miss Shanghai" and the "Queens" of each group to help disaster relief. (1) The association's Chairman Du and Vice Chairman Wu will personally participate in the garden party to elect "Miss Shanghai," and Dr. Mei Lanfang will be invited to present the awards. (2) The number of admission tickets is limited to one thousand. In the past few days, they were entrusted to major companies, dance halls, and theaters for sale. Award winners and persons in charge of various associations and reporters will be admitted with invitations, and the military and police will be asked to send personnel to assist. (4) The date of the election and garden party was decided to be postponed for five days to the 20th of this month at the New Xianlin. In addition, the chairman of the Dance Hall Industry Association, Sun Hongyuan, has strictly investigated the incident of Fei Yueshi, the dance hall manager, embezzling the 80,000 yuan earned by the dancer Li Zhenzhen, and found that it was not true. The manager also stated that if it is found to be true, he is willing to be subject to criminal punishment. The fundraising committee has sent members to conduct a new and thorough investigation, and the truth will be revealed soon. As of last night, the association had received a total of more than 19.9 million yuan in donations from the city-wide charity sale at bathhouses.

### Industrial and Commercial Leaders Save the Crisis·First Establish a Group Meeting·Responsible for Organizing Proposals·Today's Decision to go to Nanjing for Petition

[Report from this newspaper] During the occupation, Shanghai's industry and commerce suffered various forms of exploitation from the enemy and puppets, resulting in significant losses. After the victory, labor strikes arose one after another. Recently, the unrestricted import of American goods has dealt a fatal blow to domestic manufacturers, creating a serious crisis. To save this crisis, industry and commerce leaders in the city, initiated by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Industrial Association, and various trade associations, have formed a Nanjing petition delegation. After repeated meetings, yesterday at 4:00 PM, the directors and supervisors of the Industrial Association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce held a joint meeting at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Wu Yun-chu, [blank] Yi-cheng, and Jin Run-xiang served as the presidium. To gather collective wisdom, it was decided to first organize a subcommittee to be responsible for organizing proposals and scheduling the petition. Wu Yun-chu, Xu Ji-[blank], Luo Qing-hua, Jin Run-xiang, Shou Jing-wei, Tao Gui-lin, Yang Guan-bei, Pan Shi-hao, Xu Xue-yu, Yu Ming-yu, Ge Jie-cheng, Tian He-qing, Cai Xin-tao, Xu Xiao-chu, Zhu Shang-yi, and Hu Bo-xiang were appointed as members of the committee, with the secretaries of the Industrial Association and the Chamber of Commerce assisting in the work. The four principles proposed by the previous 44 trade associations to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for submission to the government will serve as the basis: (1) Strengthen banking specialization and improve financial measures. (2) Expedite production loans to rescue the financial crisis. (3) Implement an import and export marketing system and subsidize exports, or implement high-priced purchases, to adjust foreign trade. (4) Organize a revival of industrial investment companies, etc., to promote international economic cooperation.

### Taking the Exam is Difficult·More Difficult than Ascending to Heaven·Limited Quota, Unprecedented Crowd·Students Full of Schooling Panic

Taking the exam is difficult, more difficult than ascending to heaven!

During the summer vacation, swarms of students graduate from middle school and enter universities batch by batch. Although taking the university entrance exam is not easy, the chance of being "rejected" is, after all, a minority for students who are above the standard! However, this year is different. Schools are experiencing a general panic, and every school has the problem of being overcrowded. Especially those national universities that are recruiting in Shanghai, they have limited quotas, and the number of students who register for the exam often exceeds a thousand or a hundred times. This unprecedented congestion has made students shocked and panicked! They are all shouting: Taking the exam is difficult, more difficult than ascending to heaven!

The Floor is Trampled Through, the Doors and Windows are Broken·Registration is Swarming Like an Assault

The national universities recruiting in Shanghai this year include Yenching University, the Associated Universities (Tsinghua, Nankai, Peking University), Xiamen University, and the National College of Social Education. The enthusiasm of the applicants exceeded everyone's expectations. Among them, the earliest to recruit was Yenching University, and the registration location was at McTyeire School. McTyeire School has always been famous for its magnificent architecture on the sea, but on the first day of Yenching University's registration, the floor of the office was trampled through! The situation at the Associated Universities was even more tense. On the first day of registration, students were waiting at the gate of Yucai Middle School on Shanhai Pass Road as early as 6:00 AM. As soon as the gate opened, they swarmed forward, and the doors and windows were knocked down. The organizers were caught off guard and unable to cope, so they temporarily changed the method and first issued numbered registration certificates. Registration was then carried out in stages based on the order of the numbers on the certificates. At the same time, in order to maintain order on that day, they queued up in order to receive the certificates. That day, there was a line like a long snake formation, which was absolutely no different from the past when competing to buy rationed rice. Students stood for a long time, only to get a registration certificate. They had to wait until the designated day to register again, but the date and location of the exam still had to wait for the school's notification, because there were too many people registering. In addition to deciding to hold the "Associated Universities" in three sessions, it was also necessary to find examination rooms that could accommodate these students, but it has not been found to this day. The students' mood is contradictory. They are anxiously awaiting the arrival of the exam date, but they are also afraid that there is not much difference between taking the exam and not taking it, because the hope of being admitted is too small. The maximum capacity for new students at "Associated Universities" this semester is 2,000, but the number of people who have registered for the exam has reached 20,000. Calculating the ratio, it is no wonder that the students are panicking.

Low Tuition Fees Promote National Universities·Impoverished Students Call it a Savior

This crowded phenomenon is even more pronounced in national universities, which was expected, because national universities have a good reputation and low tuition fees. For example, Fudan University, etc., only charges 500 yuan for tuition, plus all kinds of miscellaneous fees, which is only 2,000 yuan. For general impoverished students, it is regarded as the only savior. At the same time, national universities all have their own specialties, so they are even more desired by students who are devoted to learning. Usually, those who study journalism compete to take the Yenching University exam, those who study engineering compete to take the Tsinghua University exam, and those who study law compete to take the Peking University exam... But the problem is that general private universities in Shanghai are no exception. This semester, the average number of applicants for each school has tripled compared to the past. For example, about 1,200 people took the first entrance exam for Shanghai University, and 200 were admitted. Because there were many students taking the exam for St. John's University, the admission standards were very strict. It is said that the students who took the exam from several famous middle schools were almost all eliminated this time.

There is More Gruel Than Monks, What Can We Do·Familiar Faces Everywhere in the Exam Room

The main reason for this unreasonable phenomenon is naturally due to the fact that students are concentrated on the Beijing-Shanghai line amidst the restoration. But another major reason is that students repeatedly apply to various schools. Because they saw that there were so many applicants, the students were greatly panicked, so they had to try their luck at various schools with a fluke mentality. According to reporters, a large number of students are preparing to rush to Nanjing to take the Central University and Jinling University exams. So the result is that they keep bumping into each other, and they are all these familiar faces! The consequence of this fact is that the students admitted to each school are also duplicates, because students with excellent grades have more opportunities to be admitted. So where will the remaining majority of students with relatively poor grades go?

Now, the enrollment of various schools is still just the beginning. Except for Yenching University, which has already taken the exam, the other schools recruiting in Shanghai have not yet decided on the date and location of the exam. After the exam, this huge number of exam papers will be transported to the original school site, and the professors will grade them separately. The day of the announcement is really far away! Where is the destination of these students wandering on the crossroads?

The enrollment exam this year is "unprecedented", but I hope it is also "unmatched"!

### Building 10,000 Houses·Needs 100 Billion in Funding

In order to solve the housing shortage in the city, the Municipal Housing Rental Management Committee has recently prepared huge sums of money from the city's banking sector to build new houses. According to the person in charge of the association, in an interview with a reporter from China News Agency: According to the city's population, in order to thoroughly solve the housing shortage, it is necessary to add 100,000 buildings. However, due to the limited funds, it is impossible to build in large quantities. The association currently plans to build 10,000 houses on vacant land or public land in the city. If each building is calculated at 10 million yuan, a total of 100 billion yuan is needed. It is not yet known whether the city's banking sector can undertake this amount. They are currently continuing to discuss loans, and the situation is quite optimistic. As for renting out the houses to citizens after they are built, whether to adopt installment payments or a one-time payment is under study.

### Repatriated Laborers·Merged for Relief

[Report from this newspaper] The Municipal Repatriated Laborers Takeover Committee was approved by General Commander He last year upon the suggestion of General MacArthur to transport 30,000 Chinese laborers repatriated within two months, 10,000 of whom landed in Shanghai. Therefore, the organization for accommodation and management could not be too small. In addition to the relevant authorities jointly organizing the committee, it established four groups: General Affairs, Control, Supply, and Hygiene. All personnel, in addition to those who were transferred, currently have more than 40 full-time employees. However, the number of repatriated laborers accommodated since its establishment has never exceeded 240 at most. The number of those still staying in the association, together with the recently newly received laborers, totals less than 80. In comparison, it is obvious that the organization needs to be streamlined. The Social Affairs Bureau originally had a Unemployed Workers Relief Committee, with a new address near the Dagong Yarn Factory on Pingliang Road, which is not far from the current address of the association and can be merged. This proposal has been passed by the last municipal meeting and will be handed over starting today.

### Xieqiao Plague Hospital·Invite Visits from All Walks of Life

There is no charge for outpatient and inpatient services, so the number of patients seeking treatment is quite crowded. The hospital also invited people from all walks of life in the city to visit yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM.

### Medical Association Established·Electing Directors and Supervisors

The Shanghai Medical Association, prepared and organized by Tu Qihua and others, has been completed and filed with the relevant authorities.

Then, representatives from the competent authorities and the Physicians Association of the Chinese Medical Association delivered speeches separately. The meeting approved the association's charter and temporary proposals. Song Daren and others proposed holding academic lectures and symposiums to facilitate research, communicate opinions, report on association affairs, and publish association journals, among other proposals. It was resolved that the directors and supervisors of the association would prepare to hold these events. Tu Qihua, Feng Zhiyin, Zhan Keming, Yao Juyan, Zhang Boren, Ni [blank] Hua, Yang Lianghong, Sun Jianmin, and Hu Zhitong were elected as directors. Wang Yanzhi, Shi Liangyuan, Jin Baiping, and Huang Kefang were elected as alternate directors. Zhu Shanji, Diao Bingchu, and Ye [blank] Bo were elected as supervisors. Pan Yong[blank] and Huang Yueli were elected as alternate supervisors.

### Banning Rickshaws and Tricycles·Considering the Problem of Drivers Changing Careers

The city is crowded with vehicles and horses, and the streets are blocked, making transportation extremely difficult. In order to improve transportation, the municipal authorities have planned to widen the area of ​​main streets and demolish protruding houses that hinder traffic. They also plan to ban rickshaws and tricycles, which are the most difficult to manage and have the largest number. However, because this matter is of great importance, once implemented, tens of thousands of drivers will suffer unemployment. To take care of this situation, the authorities have postponed the implementation period of the ban and are discussing it at length, considering issues such as drivers changing careers or being granted other job skills, in order to reduce the important post-disaster problems such as unemployment panic. According to Director Zhao of the Bureau of Public Utilities, the authorities strive for perfection in every policy they implement. The proposal to ban rickshaws and tricycles is still under precise study and will not be implemented in a short period of time.

### Firms and Companies Also in the Pharmaceutical Industry·Health Bureau Sets a Deadline for Registration

### Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Migration to Hong Kong·Chinese Businessmen Not Likely to Make Such Plans·Interview with Ouyang Lun, Director of the Industrial Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs

Ouyang Lun, Director of the Industrial Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, came to Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago. Yesterday, a reporter asked him how to solve the current difficulties in the industrial sector. He said: The Ministry has held a meeting to discuss this matter and has decided on several important principles, which are currently being consulted with relevant authorities for reference and implementation. Regarding the import and export trade, the Ministry is currently discussing improvements with the Ministry of Finance. Regarding the rumors that Shanghai's industry and commerce are trending towards migration to Hong Kong, the reporter asked if the Ministry of Economic Affairs has made appropriate considerations. He said: Minister Wang is also paying close attention to this matter. However, based on my observation, foreign-funded enterprises may have this change, but because it is not easy for domestic industrial circles to migrate funds and equipment, they are unlikely to make such plans in fact. The reporter then asked if there are preferential measures for private factories in the rear when bidding for enemy and puppet factories. He said: The bidding for enemy and puppet factories is handled by the Enemy and Puppet Property Bureau. As for whether there are preferential measures for private factories in the rear, I have not heard of them yet because I have been busy these days. Finally, the reporter asked whether the government will continue to handle industrial loans and orders for private factories and mines. He said: The Ministry of Economic Affairs is discussing with the Joint Office on how to continue to organize industrial loans. As for ordering from private factories and mines, it was organized in the rear during the war. After Japan surrendered, it was impossible to continue due to the lack of government budget and limited financial resources.

The police arrested the air force officer on the spot. After being brought to the bureau for questioning, he directly admitted to forging the official seal and documents in order to defraud money.

### Teacher's Desperate Suicide; Hongshun Mutual Aid Society Re-established; Tangkou Decorated with Red Silk and Lion Dance Celebrations

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Hongshun Mutual Aid Society of this city was established in April of the 19th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1930]. It is one of the charitable welfare organizations of the Hongmen, founded by Yang Wendao. In those years, it enjoyed considerable prestige and attracted the attention of the Japanese invaders. The Yang Wendao case was implicated; it was not unrelated to his chairmanship of this society. During the war, the society suffered from military disturbances, and its headquarters were completely destroyed. Furthermore, due to Yang's arrest, the society's affairs were suspended. Yesterday afternoon, a re-establishment meeting was specifically held at the Guangzhao Public School on North Sichuan Road. Approximately a thousand people attended, including Yang Wendao, Liao Zengxun, Situ Meitang, Zhu Jiazhao, and both old and new members, most of whom were Cantonese. The entrance hall of the meeting place was decorated with red silk, and it was filled with gifts such as flower baskets, silver tripods, horizontal scrolls, and vertical banners donated by various Hongmen groups. Outside the entrance, lion dances and martial arts were performed under the scorching sun to express celebration. The atmosphere was particularly enthusiastic.

Yesterday, a young man committed suicide at the Xin Hengchang Hotel, No. 661 Zhejiang Road. The incident occurred on the 3rd at 4:00 PM when a young man wearing Hong Kong-style shirt and trousers checked into Room 10. He left the name Hang Jianqiu, from Yixing, 28 years old, a police academy graduate visiting friends in Shanghai, etc., in the hotel register. Shortly thereafter, he closed the door and went to sleep. Until 11:30 AM yesterday, a tea server, Ni Dahe, noticed that the guest had not yet gotten up. He opened the door and entered, finding Hang Jianqiu lying on his side on the bed, unconscious and unresponsive. There was a bottle of sedative pills on the table, indicating that the guest had taken poison. He urgently summoned an ambulance, which rushed the man to the Gongji Hospital. Due to severe poisoning, he remained unconscious last night. Upon further investigation of Room 10, which Hang had opened, there was a letter of appointment from the National School of Yixing County, two pawn tickets, and over 50 legal tender. It is believed that the cause of his suicide was likely that he was unable to find his friends, had reached a dead end, and resorted to this desperate measure.

Civil Administration Briefs

### Government and Education Personnel Purchasing Goods Should Obtain Stamp Tax Receipts; The Municipal Government, After Receiving Orders, Relayed Them to Various Agencies for Compliance

The Municipal Government recently received an order from the Executive Yuan, citing a report from the Ministry of Finance stating that commercial invoices, receipts for money and goods, and bills are the main sources of stamp tax revenue. All manufacturers should issue invoices for sold goods and affix stamp tax stamps in accordance with the law. However, in reality, many manufacturers evade taxes by not issuing receipts for goods sold, money received, or services provided by hotels and restaurants, and those who receive receipts also do not have the habit of requesting receipts to urge stamping. This has resulted in significant losses in stamp tax revenue. It is proposed that the Executive Yuan issue separate orders to all military, government, and educational personnel nationwide to take the lead in advocating and establishing a trend. When purchasing goods or paying money, they must request invoices, receipts, and bills, and supervise the person issuing the document to affix stamps, in order to prevent tax evasion, etc. Based on this, it should be approved and implemented. After receiving the order, the Municipal Government relayed it to all subordinate agencies for compliance yesterday.

The following key points are specifically listed: (1) The work of eliminating opium and other drugs should be raised to a higher level compared to other central tasks, and a percentage should be clearly defined. (2) Personnel and expenses should be appropriately allocated to the competent and assisting anti-drug agencies, and efforts should be made to concentrate their use. (3) Various administrative meetings and administrative inspections should focus on anti-drug efforts. (4) Administrative procedures should prioritize anti-drug efforts and strive to simplify them.

The Provincial and Municipal Governments Should Give Priority to Hiring

In addition to sending separate letters from this association, we are hereby writing again to request verification and instruct the provincial and municipal governments to comply, and we hope to receive a reply.

### Questions and Answers on Household Registration Laws and Regulations (Continued)

(23) Question: If a son who remarries with his mother still uses his biological father's surname and returns to his original family after reaching adulthood, can he be listed as a family member?

Answer: Article 1078 of the Civil Code stipulates that "adopted children take the surname of the adopter," and the first paragraph of Article 1078 of the same law stipulates that "the adoption of children shall be in writing." If a son who remarries with his mother still uses his biological father's surname and has not applied for adoption registration in accordance with Article 67 of the Household Registration Law, he cannot be called an "adopted son." He can be listed as an "other family member," and the words "foster care" should be noted in the remarks column.

(24) Question: If a relative resides with the head of household, but there is no blood relationship or cohabitation, and the time is very long, and they have no home to return to, can they be listed as a family member in the household registration book if they are listed as cohabitants in the Baojia household registration book?

Answer: If there is an intention to live permanently together in the household, they can be listed as other family members.

(25) Question: If the mother is alive and the son is a minor, and the son is listed as the head of household in the Baojia household registration book, can the mother be changed to be the head of the family during household registration?

Answer: According to Article 1 of the supplementary instructions for filling out the form issued by this Ministry, the mother can be changed to be the head of the family, and the Baojia book should be corrected at the same time.

### District Briefs

The Shanghai Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration will distribute relief flour at five locations in the Fourth District (Penglai) on August 6: No. 285 Wangjia Pier, Penglai Road Customs Brokerage Office, Jiyin Temple on Zhonghua Road, Baiyun Temple on Fangxie Road, and Yixin Primary School on Guohuo Road. It is stipulated that impoverished households must bring their National Identity Card and go to their respective Baojia heads to obtain a receipt, and then go to the designated distribution location to receive the flour.

The first phase of share recruitment for the Cooperative in the Twenty-third District (Wusong) ended at the end of last month, totaling more than 8 million yuan. Business will begin soon. In addition, Deputy District Chief Xu Jianmin presented a request to the Municipal Government yesterday to return to his hometown on leave, and all duties of the Deputy District Chief will be temporarily handled by General Manager Su Han.

The inaugural meeting of the District People's Representative Assembly of the Fifteenth District (North Station) of this city is scheduled to be reconvened on the 17th of this month at the Fifteenth District Central National School on Kenenghai Road. In addition, the newly appointed Deputy District Chief Zheng Qingfu reported to his office on August 1 to assume his duties. Bao Chief Shen Guoxiang of the Nineteenth Bao has earnestly resigned from his concurrent position as a District People's Representative, which has been approved. The vacancy will be filled by Shen Yongkang. Shen Zhaoying, the cadre of the Forty-third Bao, and Liu Gedi, the cadre of the Ninth Bao, have been transferred to each other's positions.

The first meeting of the Nineteenth District People's Representative Assembly resolved to establish three committees: mediation, economy, and cultural promotion. Currently, fair-minded people who are familiar with the law within the district are being invited to organize the mediation committee.

The household registration statistics for June in the Twenty-sixth District have been reported to the Municipal Government. The district has 25 Bao, 618 Jia, and 17,802 households, with 37,122 males and 40,426 females, an increase of 610 males and 295 females compared to last month.

### Reply to Mr. Guo Xiushi

The Municipal Government's Civil Affairs Department recently replied to Mr. Guo Xiushi, saying: Regarding the inquiry as to whether a district chief can concurrently serve as a municipal councilor, Article 2 of the Municipal Councilor Election Regulations restricts elected civil servants to a narrow definition of civil servants. District chiefs are personnel who handle local self-government and are currently referred to as public officials, not civil servants, so there are no restrictions during elections. After being elected, it does not hinder the exercise of their original powers, and the Executive Yuan's interpretation allows them to hold concurrent positions.

### 40,000 Children in Tianjin Out of School; 3,800 Middle School Students Out of School

[Special dispatch from our newspaper in Tianjin on the 4th] The problem of children out of school in Tianjin is serious. During the summer vacation, more than 100 elementary schools enrolled students, with each school enrolling only 50 to 100 students, while each had about 500 applicants. As a result, 40,000 children will have no school to attend. The admission rate for middle schools is even lower. Tianjin Provincial Middle School alone had 4,000 applicants, and only 200 were admitted. The remaining 3,800 were rejected and left without direction.

### Causes and Consequences of the Oil Crisis: No Special Stimulus, No Supply and Demand Problems; Oil Merchants Request Improvement in Allocation Methods

[Report from our newspaper] Edible oil is one of the main daily necessities. Recently, the imbalance between supply and demand has caused quite a stir. Fortunately, with the proper handling by all parties concerned, the situation is gradually easing. According to the reporter's investigation, the edible oil problem in this city will become clearer in the future. Its price may become more reasonable with the increase in supply.

Those in the know believe that the recent edible oil crisis was not accidental. The reasons are: (1) Depleted inventory: Since March of this year, oil prices have remained stable. General囤戶 (people who hoard goods) have been gradually selling to edible oil retail stores due to the unbearable burden of暗息 (interest on underground loans). (2) Traffic obstruction: Qingdao, Dalian, and northern Jiangsu were originally major suppliers of edible oil to this city. Now, due to local unrest, the normal supply volume has been affected, and the sources are intermittent. (3) Actual sales are still brisk: Retail customers in this city are buying actively, and gangs from Guangdong and Yong also come to purchase from time to time. (4) The output of various factories in this city has not returned to normal. Statistics show that the total output of seven private oil factories has been reduced by half compared to before the war. (5) The immediate cause was that when oil prices were gradually rising at the end of last month, the China Vegetable Oil Factory allocated edible oil to the market, but the quantity was limited, and those applying for allocation came in droves. In this situation of too many monks and too little porridge, the original allocation method was temporarily canceled once.

Unexpectedly, the market at the end of last month was stimulated by this immediate cause, which caused the accumulated problems of edible oil to erupt. As a result, the oil market was unable to trade because of the authorities' price suppression regulations, and it was closed for three days. The black market then emerged. The highest black market prices for various grades of edible oil were 90,000 yuan per担 (approximately 100 lbs) for raw oil, 80,000 yuan per担 for soybean oil, and 70,000 yuan per担 for rapeseed oil.

Official and Business Sectors Jointly Stabilize Market Prices

The Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, believing that this matter was related to people's livelihood, summoned oil and grain merchant representatives such as Yang Mingzhou on July 29, instructing them to consider the people's food supply and quickly resume business. At the same time, the responsible persons of the Oil and Grain Guild also convened a joint meeting with the oil extraction industry, resolving to resume normal business in the market from July 31. On the one hand, the market price of raw oil was reviewed based on the cost of the producing area, and it was decided that it should not exceed 85,000 yuan per担, the market price of soybean oil should not exceed 80,000 yuan per担, and the market price of rapeseed oil should not exceed 73,000 yuan per担. The reviewed prices were approved by the Social Affairs Bureau. At the same time, the Oil and Grain Guild was instructed to process the shipment of all oil and grain warehouse receipts that had already been traded on the market within one week. Subsequently, warehouse receipt transactions should not exceed ten days, in order to prevent abnormal and "kick the ball" transactions.

Direct Allocation by Two State-Run Oil Factories

The China Vegetable Oil Factory of the Ministry of Economic Affairs is also actively allocating edible oil to retail stores. There are a total of 600 retail stores, divided into three groups: A, B, and C, which have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. In addition, the China Edible Oil Company of the Ministry of Food also directly allocates raw oil to retail merchants, once a week, with each store receiving at least four barrels or so and up to ten barrels or so. It is not a fixed amount, and the allocation price is generally a few thousand yuan lower than the market price.

Daily Output of Seven Factories is More Than Enough for This City

The edible oil crisis has gradually calmed down due to these measures. Oil prices have also stabilized without suppression. According to oil industry insiders, the daily consumption of edible oil in this city is about 1,000担. It has been found that there are seven private oil extraction factories in this city: Dayouyu, Dachangxin, Dasheng, Dadexin, Changde, Weimin, and Shunyu. The total pre-war output of these seven factories was about 2,000担 per day. The recent total output has been reduced by about half, but it can still produce more than 1,000担 per day. Among these products, raw oil accounts for about 30%, and rapeseed oil accounts for about 70%. Therefore, in terms of the total output of these seven factories alone, the supply of edible oil for the entire city is more than sufficient. In addition, the China Vegetable Oil Factory can still produce more than 700担 of edible oil per day based on the current power supply. Once the power supply is fully restored, the output will increase even more. The China Edible Oil Company currently has as many as 3,000 to 4,000 barrels of oil in stock. Therefore, judging from the city's own ability to produce edible oil, there is absolutely no problem with the city's continuous and unlimited supply of edible oil.

Goods from Qingyun and Other Places Rely on Barter

Next, the supply of edible oil to this city from other places can be divided into long-distance and short-distance. Long-distance sources are mainly Dalian and Qingdao. However, due to recent local unrest and traffic obstruction in these two places, the sources have become increasingly sluggish. In addition, transportation tools rely on sailboats, and the shipping schedule cannot be determined. Nineteen out of ten transactions are based on barter. For example, in Dalian, it is necessary to exchange corn and wheat for goods. In Qingdao's small ports, it is necessary to exchange daily necessities, fancy clothes, and cotton cloth for goods. In the past two weeks, only 500 to 600 barrels of soybean oil, equivalent to more than 2,000担, have been shipped to this city from Dalian. In Qingdao, the market price of raw oil is 76,000 yuan per担. Adding barrel fees, leakage, discount, and miscellaneous expenses when shipping to Shanghai, it costs about 20,000 yuan per担. It is estimated that the net cost per担 after deducting the barrel is 90,000 yuan. However, the current market price of raw oil in Shanghai is only 80,000 yuan per担, so it is impossible to ship it to Shanghai for sale. Recently, the number of ships transporting oil has also decreased because all transport sailboats must be repaired and renovated at this time, which also affects the source of edible oil.

Goods from Changzhou and Wuxi Change with Market Prices

Short-distance sources such as Wuxi and Changzhou relied on this city for the supply of edible oil before the war. After the war, due to the soaring price of edible oil in this city, and there being many old-fashioned oil mills in Wuxi and Changzhou, which self-extracted edible oil, the market price was sometimes cheaper than that in Shanghai. Therefore, some edible oil was sometimes shipped to Shanghai. However, recently, the market price of soybean oil in these two places is about 76,000 yuan per担. Adding miscellaneous expenses of 7,000 to 8,000 yuan, the cost per担 after shipping to Shanghai has reached 82,000 to 83,000 yuan, so it is also impossible to ship it to Shanghai for sale. Therefore, the relationship between supply and demand of edible oil between Wuxi, Changzhou, and Shanghai depends purely on the level of oil prices in the two places. As for Suzhou and Songjiang, it is currently impossible to talk about supplying edible oil to this city.

Based on the above, this city cannot yet have high hopes for the supply of edible oil from other places. However, if it can restore local order and facilitate traffic, the addition of external sources will be another factor for stabilizing the edible oil problem in this city.

Oil Merchants Feel Depressed After Direct Allocation

Although the edible oil problem in this city has now come to an end, the 70 to 80 oil firms under the Oil and Grain Guild have complained. These oil firms usually act as intermediaries in the market, earning commissions. Now, the China Vegetable Oil Factory and the China Edible Oil Company allocate edible oil directly to retail merchants without the help of oil firms. From the perspective of the China Vegetable Oil Factory and the China Edible Oil Company, this move is to simplify allocation procedures and make prices simple and low, so that the general public can benefit. However, as a result, the livelihoods of these 70 to 80 oil firms are threatened because they have no business to operate. In addition, based on the current market price of edible oil in this city, it is impossible to purchase and transport edible oil from Qingdao and other places, so oil merchants feel depressed. It is said that they have now petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting improvement in the allocation methods of the China Vegetable Oil Factory and other factories. At the same time, they are trying to encourage various merchants to purchase edible oil in various producing areas and transport it to Shanghai for sale, in order to maintain the livelihoods of oil merchants.

### Worsted Wool Fabric Sales Launch

Worsted wool fabric has recently become popular, and customers from distant places continue to inquire about purchases. Because it is a popular commodity, its usual market price is much higher than other types of wool fabric. The "Tiger" brand is the most important, followed by "Hualun Jiaotong." The price fluctuations of other brands of worsted wool fabric largely depend on these two brands, because customers from all over the interior provinces and regions base their purchases on these two brands. In terms of color, grass green is still the most popular, followed by navy blue and then primary color. In terms of price, the factories and retailers have different prices based on the sales conditions. Goods of the same quality can differ by several thousand yuan per yard. Currently, the asking price for Yinfeng grass green worsted wool fabric at the public tea party is 70,000 yuan, navy blue is 62,500 yuan, and primary green is 55,000 to 60,000 yuan. In addition, old-fashioned cyan-gray and blue-gray worsted wool fabric have recently become fashionable again.

### Freight for Tung Oil from Chongqing to Shanghai is Ten Times Higher than from Shanghai to the United States

[United Press Washington, 3rd] American merchants purchasing Chinese tung oil claim that the sluggish supply of tung oil in the United States is mainly due to the slow transportation and high freight costs from the Chinese production area to the export location. The market price of tung oil has not fluctuated and remains at 38 3/8 cents per pound for bulk and 39 to 41 cents per pound for barreled. Due to the restoration of price controls, merchants are taking a wait-and-see attitude towards ordering tung oil. According to recent news from China, tung oil in Hankou and other inland areas has risen in price. It takes about two months to transport goods from Chongqing to Shanghai, and the freight cost is 30,000 Chinese yuan (approximately 15 US dollars), which is about ten times higher than the ocean freight rate from Shanghai to the United States. Merchants here hope that the recent allocation of inland river-suitable vessels to China by the United States will accelerate cargo transportation on the Yangtze River. The American agricultural mission currently in China is working to increase tung oil production from the current 40,000 tons to more than the pre-war production of 75,000 tons, so that both China and purchasing countries can benefit.

### Silk and Tea in Hangzhou are Both on the Brink of Collapse; 61 Silk Stores Have Closed; Tea Warehouses are Also Overwhelmed by Usury

[Hangzhou News] The silk industry in Hangzhou is facing difficulties in both export and domestic sales, and wages are extremely high, making costs very heavy. So far, it has been difficult to develop. In addition, their own financial resources are weak, and they have to rely on usury to turn around. Therefore, according to the guild's statistics, 61 silk stores have closed due to the difficulty of operation, accounting for one-fifth of the total number of silk stores in this city. Yesterday, Hengfu Silk Store declared bankruptcy due to a shortage of funds and the inability to turn around, with losses estimated at around 50 to 60 million yuan. It is reported that this has shaken more than seven or eight stores, and the market is panicked and feels uneasy.

In addition, Zhejiang tea, except for Longjing produced specifically for sale in this province and Shanghai, is completely exported from Ping Shui and Wenzhou. In addition, tea produced in Anhui and Jiangxi is concentrated in Hangzhou. Therefore, there are many tea warehouses in Hangzhou. Recently, due to the lack of export channels and the pressure of usury, the number of those who have been forced to close down is increasing day by day. Gongyi Xiang has gone bankrupt, and Ruihe and Xie Xingyong have negotiated with creditors to repay debts by stopping interest. The remaining tea firms are uneasy due to this impact.

### Sluggish Seafood Market

The seafood market is experiencing quiet supply and sales, with all goods trending towards stagnation. Due to the excessive arrival of Yichang fungus, the export of tree ears is not moving, and street sales are also dull, leading to a significant decline. There are few newly arrived Xiang lotus seeds, and sales are slow. It is said that goods are arriving continuously by land, and the market will likely be cheaper in the future. About one hundred and ten boxes of Hong Kong shrimp tails are about to arrive in Shanghai. However, the quality is poor and the quantity is insufficient. At this time of sluggish trading, it will be difficult to establish a foothold. High-quality Haiwei dried scallops have a thin stock but sell well, and the arrival of goods is extremely scarce, causing prices to rise. The momentum of other goods is stagnant and dull, and prices are also mediocre.

High Price of Glutinous Rice Branches

Glutinous rice branches are priced higher than old stock due to low production. Recently, the arrival of sources is scarce, and the market stock is also in short supply, so the price has risen again, increasing by about 20% overall. The market price is around 700,000 yuan.

### Kerosene Overwhelms Coal Balls; Hongji Coal Dust Still Out of Stock

Since the resumption of production by various coal ball factories in this city, sales have been unusually sluggish. According to statistics, the total sales volume is less than a quarter of what it was before the war. The industry has reduced the selling price from 10,000 yuan to 8,000 yuan, but the result has not improved. It is said that there are three reasons for this: (1) Kerosene is being sold in large quantities, and citizens find it more cost-effective, so they are happy to use it; (2) In the two or three decades after the surrender, many citizens have switched to burning firewood because the factories did not supply coal balls; (3) Hongyi coal dust is not flowing smoothly due to maritime transportation relations, and the cost is high, so there is no way to reduce the price further.

### Czech Finance Minister Says Exchange Will Never Reopen

[Reuters, Prague, 4th] Czech Finance Minister Dr. Ďuriš told Reuters yesterday that the Prague Stock Exchange would never reopen because under the planned economy system, there is no place for its existence. Mr. Ďuriš is the first Communist to serve as Minister of Finance.

### Rong Xiangqian and Others Found Rongfeng Yarn Tube Factory

[Our Newspaper] In order to promote the development of local textile industry, local industrialists Rong Xiangqian, Wang Zheying, etc. recently founded Rongfeng Yarn Tube Factory at 1484 Changning Road. The scale is quite large, with a daily output of about 100,000 yarn tubes. The factory has now started operations and is scheduled to hold an opening ceremony on the 10th of this month.

### Salt and Flour Loan Syndicates in Progress

[Our Newspaper] It is reported that since the decision to handle the loan syndicates for salt and flour, the Bankers Association has sent letters to its member banks to participate in the underwriting. It is now known that, to date, 24 or 25 banks have participated in the underwriting of the two syndicates. It is heard that the Association also sent letters yesterday urging those banks that have not yet expressed their opinions to reply with their participation quota within three days so that the case can be handled.

Fushou Co., Ltd. was initiated by Dong Zhaofeng and others, with a capital of 120 million yuan, which has been fully subscribed. It mainly operates in shipping, import and export, agency customs declaration. Baoshou Co., Ltd. was initiated by Zhou Haochang and others, with a capital of 5 million yuan. More than 5% of the shares were subscribed by the initiators, and the rest are being recruited.

Dakang Trading Co., Ltd. was initiated by Wang Muwei and others, with a capital of 8 million yuan, which has been fully subscribed. It mainly operates in tobacco leaf paper circles, miscellaneous grains, etc. The location is at 502 Wuzhou Building.

### Factors Endangering the Dyeing and Weaving Industry; Two Immediate Relief Measures; The Content of the Industry's Submissions to the Ministry of Finance and Economics

[Our Newspaper] Currently, the textile industry is the only industry that can be supported, especially the spinning industry, which is relatively prosperous. However, the dyeing and weaving industry does not have spinning equipment, and the yarn factories that also operate weaving are not included in the scope of the industry. This industry is a general term for pure dyeing factories, pure weaving factories, and dyeing and weaving factories. Its situation is different from that of the yarn factory industry. Since the enemy puppets forcibly purchased yarn and cloth, the dyeing and weaving industry and the sales business of cotton cloth and cotton yarn were the most severely damaged. The dyeing and weaving industry is even more unsustainable due to the pressure of high interest rates. Recently, due to the imminent crisis, it has submitted reports to the Ministry of Economy and the Ministry of Finance, requesting relief. The following is an excerpt of its content:

The machine dyeing and weaving industry has a history of more than 40 years since its inception. It is the oldest and most established industry in the light industry. Before the war, there were 1,200 factories in the Shanghai area, with 160 dyeing machines and 30,000 weaving machines. There were 120,000 workers, with a daily output of 60,000 woven cloths and 160,000 dyed cloths, making it the center of the domestic light industry. However, since the victory, the resumption of work in the dyeing and weaving industry has been fraught with difficulties, and all factories have fallen into despair. Those who have not started work are even more at a loss and are sitting and waiting to die. According to the current production volume, it is only half of what it was before the war. The factors that have caused the crisis are:

(1) Special Losses During the War of Resistance

In August of the 32nd year, the enemy puppets forcibly requisitioned yarn and cloth, and the dyeing and weaving factories bore the brunt. A total of 3,400 pieces of yarn and 999,407 pieces of cloth were seized, resulting in a loss of 29,127,267,100 yuan, accounting for 76% of the working capital.

(2) Lack of Funds and High Interest Rates

According to the industrial production process, it takes a relatively long time, and the capital turnover is also slow, which is not as fast as that of commerce. According to the current operation of the machine dyeing and weaving industry, even the smallest factory needs a working capital of 50 million yuan per month. Calculated at an interest rate of 20%, the monthly amount is as high as 10 million yuan. Now, a total of 453 factories are in operation, with an average monthly supply of working capital of 100 million yuan, totaling 45.3 billion yuan. The interest expenditure requires 9.06 billion yuan. Calculated at a cost of 50,000 yuan per piece of gray cloth, 181,200 pieces of cloth can be woven. The pressure of high interest rates is heavy, and the selling price is also expensive. In the cost of living index published by the Shanghai Municipal Government in May and June, the item of clothing has the highest number, which is clear evidence.

(3) Expensive Raw Materials and Difficult Processing

At the beginning of the victory, 20-count yarn was only about 120,000 yuan per piece. The average price in June was 1.2 million yuan, which is more than 10 times higher. The crux of the problem is that yarn prices are not regulated, and the state-owned textile construction company is making a profit. For the cotton products industry, such as yarn, one piece can weave 34 pieces of cloth. Calculated at a price of 1.2 million yuan per piece of 20-count yarn, the raw material alone requires more than 35,000 yuan. Other factory payments such as power, wages, donations, taxes, and high interest rates all contribute to the increase in costs, while cloth is only sold for about 50,000 yuan, so there is not only no profit to be made, but even losses.

To sum up the above three points, the crisis of our machine dyeing and weaving industry is actually due to the seizure by the enemy puppets, the shortage of funds, the pressure of high interest rates, and the expensive raw materials. The only way to remedy the situation is to:

(1) Quickly Issue and Select the Remaining Yarn and Cloth

This remaining yarn and cloth originally belonged to the victimized manufacturers, and is by no means enemy puppet property. The industry association has repeatedly submitted reports to the handling authorities requesting its return, but it has not been approved to date. It is important to know that returning the yarn and cloth is to revive the vitality of the dyeing and weaving industry, replenish the resources for production, and is also the key to reversing the crisis. Therefore, we should request that the authorities be ordered to quickly issue and return it.

(2) Urgently Handle Dyeing and Weaving Industrial Loans

The dyeing and weaving industry has also requested industrial loans from the Four Joint Offices, but most have not received a response. Even the three or four companies that have been invited to be approved have not yet received the funds. The request to issue funds has not been answered, and there is even a proposal to stop industrial loans because they are enough to fuel inflation. How can it be known that the factory shutdown and the industrial crisis are all due to a lack of funds? Obtaining loans will inevitably first reduce high-interest debt, and the currency can therefore be contracted, and there is absolutely no possibility of fueling inflation. The needs of the dyeing and weaving industry for loans are to add equipment and purchase raw materials, and the bulk of raw materials are the yarn and cloth of the China Textile Company and the dyes of the Defu Foreign Company. One is state-owned and the other is enemy property. Therefore, the use of loans is generally on the right track and is also a state-owned income, and there is no concern about inflation.

For this reason, the crisis of the dyeing and weaving industry and the way to save it are presented, and we pray that you will order the Four Joint Offices to quickly organize dyeing and weaving industrial loans, and simplify the loan procedures so as to facilitate emergency relief and benefit production.

### Inside a Mental Hospital

— Written by Our Reporter So Bei, Photography by Ting Peng Chuang Shuo

Villagers rarely suffer from mental illness. They lead simple lives, engaging in more physical labor and less mental exertion, neither constantly indulging in wild thoughts nor harboring excessive desires. Consequently, many doctors have told reporters that mental illness is, in fact, a disease of civilization. For the same reason, the number of mentally ill individuals in the United States is also increasing year by year. According to the July issue of "Reader's Digest," President Truman recently declared to Congress: "At least two million people in the United States suffer from mental illness. At least ten million people, at some point in their lives, will need to be admitted to a mental hospital."

Half of All Hospital Beds in the U.S. Occupied by Mental Patients

"Forty-seven percent of all hospital beds in the United States are occupied by mental patients; in Massachusetts and New York, one in every one hundred and fifty people suffers from mental illness, and in every one hundred adults, at least one will suffer from mental illness at some point in their lives."

This is a report from the American medical community recently received by Mr. Zhang Yuanchang, Director of the Department of Mental Diseases at the Chinese Red Cross.

Shanghai, a city of extreme and distorted prosperity, now has more mental patients than before the war. However, society has little awareness of this. Many minor nerve disorders and mild manic disorders (including those who are arrogant and consider themselves superior) are considered simply eccentric personalities, not recognized as pathological conditions. Some time ago, a young dancer forcibly occupied someone's seat in a dance hall, leading to a conflict with other dancers. As a result, he was beaten bloody, yet remained stubborn and defiant. When taken to the police station, he still refused to "cooperate." Consequently, the police sent him to the Red Cross for treatment, who then transferred him to the Department of Mental Diseases. This patient was an extremely arrogant mentally ill individual.

The Shanghai Mental Hospital Founded by Mr. Lu Bohong

Shanghai has a very large mental hospital with nearly three hundred patients, including people of various nationalities. The facilities are excellent, but few people know about it. This hospital is the Puchi Sanatorium, located not far from Minhang, just north of the North Bridge Bus Station on the Shanghai-Minhang Highway. It was founded eleven years ago by the late Mr. Lu Bohong, with the background of the Catholic Charity Association and the Catholic Welfare Committee. After Mr. Lu's assassination, his son, Mr. Lu Yinggeng, took over. Although it is called a sanatorium, it is actually a mental hospital. The reason it is not called a mental hospital is due to careful consideration: some patients' families consider it a disgrace to send family members to a mental hospital or madhouse.

The architecture and environment of the Puchi Sanatorium are magnificent and serene. Even the most volatile and stubborn patients, upon entering the hospital gates, I believe, would feel refreshed and uplifted.

Inside, there are five or six ward buildings, divided into four classes. The first-class fee is less than 20,000 yuan per day (including three meals, snacks, and miscellaneous expenses), the second-class fee is 10,000 yuan, the third-class fee is 7,000 yuan, and the fourth-class fee is free.

Speaking of free, it's not just the fourth class. Currently, there are one hundred and fifty patients who pay nothing at all. Among them are the "street lunatics" sent by the former Shanghai Municipal Council, as well as patients whose history is as long as the hospital's. They have nowhere to go, and their illnesses have not improved, so the hospital has no choice but to accommodate them.

More than thirty patients, due to treatment being sought too late (approximately two or three years after the onset of the illness), have no hope of recovery. These groups of despair are housed in the wards of another building. Although these people still suffer from mental illness, they are no longer violent. Their thoughts are probably trapped in a state of chaotic stillness, rarely speaking or moving. There is a female nun who, after becoming ill, was hospitalized for treatment but to no effect. Now, she stands all day with her hands clasped, muttering to herself, but without sound, often smiling at people. Her bed is often covered with many books, on which are written incomprehensible words, occasionally including phrases like "I am the Holy King."

Mental patients interrupt when doctors inspect the wards and talk. Doctors can glean part of the source of their illness from their incoherent words.

Mental patients playing dominoes.

Various Types of Chinese and Foreign Mental Patients Are Amusing

In total, there are two hundred and eighty-six patients, including fifty-six foreigners, comprising British, Portuguese, Russian, Greek, Jewish, and other nationalities, with Jews being the most numerous. There is a Greek patient who has suffered from mental illness since childhood, likely congenital. This person has no teeth, and his physical appearance is quite robust. He has never spoken a word, constantly tapping his left fist with his right hand, causing changes to the skin on his left fist. When the reporter tried to take his picture, he quickly ran away. It is said that this Greek man's father is a wealthy businessman. He is an "only child" and was extremely spoiled by his parents, but his mother was killed by him.

Walking into the wards, the strange and varied sights do not make you laugh, but rather make you think: why are there so many tragedies in the world? These patients, the sufferers outside the circle of happiness, may have once had beautiful encounters, but now they are all protagonists of tragedy. "Are more people driven mad by failed speculation or by disappointment in love?" I asked Dr. Liu Yide (a mental health expert). "Recently, many have become ill due to failed speculation," he replied.

Then, a patient said to the reporter, "Shanghai is asking him to settle the accounts! Settle the accounts!!" It is said that this patient asks everyone to settle the accounts.

The ward facilities have no significant or unusual features because one cannot increase the stimulation to the patients' nerves. Knowing that the glass windows are often sacrificed by patients, you cannot add wire mesh, making the patients feel like they are in prison. Here, the ward windows only have beautiful iron bars for protection, aiming to protect the glass without leaving a mark. In the United States, they use shatterproof glass. Here, the patients' dining room is also beautifully decorated, with white tablecloths, vases, and paintings, very artistic.

Patients are divided into two categories: civil and military. The civil ones are "thinkers" and "artists" who go crazy on their own, not bothering others, making music, and drawing pictures. The walls of the wards are adorned with excellent works. The military ones are the opposite, using their hands and feet and talking. Probably the patients who have just entered the hospital are more military, with not a few who hit people. The hospital, in addition to nurses accompanying them, temporarily puts leather gloves on those who are very violent, tying their hands together, making it impossible for them to act.

Their daily life is very regulated, with outdoor activities every day. Those who like religion or are originally religious attend church in the hospital on Sundays. Incoming mail is inspected by the hospital, and anything considered to stimulate the patient's mind is withheld.

Hospital Finances Are Tight, Relying on Church and Red Cross Support

Although the hospital is large, because it is non-profit, almost half of the patients cannot afford to pay, and even those who pay are very limited. Damage to property by patients is also unavoidable, so the hospital's finances are not very comfortable. It relies entirely on the church and the hospital director to find ways to manage. Therefore, the British Red Cross and the U.S. military have donated to the hospital. The U.S. military has also sent many English magazines for patients to read. The hospital hopes to receive donated Chinese newspapers for use by Chinese patients.

Due to financial difficulties, the hospital is discussing with the Municipal Health Bureau the long-term accommodation of those who cannot afford to pay and have no hope of recovery. Indeed, those groups of despair no longer contribute to society, but from a humanitarian standpoint, the government should provide relief to the disabled.

The Puchi Sanatorium was established in June of the 24th year of the Republic of China (1935) and was founded by the late Lu Bohong, near the North Bridge Town of Minhang.

Measures for Clearing Land Rights in Recovered Areas

Land rights in recovered areas, due to the disturbance and changes caused by the enemy and puppet regimes during the occupation period, have frequently led to disputes since the victory. The government has formulated and promulgated measures for clearing land rights in recovered areas to protect the legitimate rights of the original landowners and to serve as the basis for handling the clearing of land rights in recovered areas. The measures stipulate that the property certificates held for land rights are limited to the following four clauses: (1) land title deeds issued by legally registered land; (2) land business licenses issued by legally filed land reports; (3) land right certificates issued by other laws and regulations for sorting out land registration; and (4) original land right certificates held by the people in areas where land registration has not been sorted out in accordance with laws and regulations. Any disposal of the company's land by the enemy and puppet organizations and the land right certificates issued by them are invalid. If the documents held by the landowner are stamped with the seals of enemy and puppet organizations, the original enemy and puppet seals shall be stamped with the "invalid" mark during the clearing. The public land released for farming is also invalid. However, if the recipient is a self-cultivating farmer and continues to cultivate, he may be given a time limit to reapply for the contract procedures and be exempted from payment. For private land that has been confiscated or forcibly occupied, the landowner shall be issued a property certificate for return. If the landowner cannot produce a property certificate, he may obtain a certificate from the county, township, town, and village heads, or from the four neighbors. For private land that has been levied with payment, it shall be kept in government custody for clearing. The landowner may be allowed to submit conclusive evidence to pay back the amount received at the time of levy according to the monthly issue of the price index. For private land forcibly occupied by the people of enemy countries or traitors, the original landowner's rights may be returned if they present property evidence. In areas where the municipal and county governments could not exercise political power during the war, the transfer of land rights shall be registered by the land rights transferee with the municipal and county government within six months of the local recovery of government power. In areas where land registration has not yet been carried out, tax deeds shall be supplemented. The land rights clearing agency shall be the county and municipal government. However, the land received by the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau shall be jointly cleared by the Bureau and the county and municipal governments. [Central News Agency]

Nurses Work Hard and Endure the Patients' Beatings and Scoldings

What is most touching are the three doctors and nurses (more than twenty nurses, twelve of whom are nuns). They quietly sacrifice their own enjoyment outside the circle of the city to treat the insane. The nurses endure the patients' beatings and scoldings, constantly paying attention to the patients' actions, working hard and bearing grievances, which is commendable. When patients tear up the sheets, break the windows, and lose their temper, they can only clean up for them properly.

Mr. Dong, a director of the Charity Association, a French national, is responsible for the actual affairs of the hospital. He is sixty years old, but looks only forty. During the Japanese occupation of Shanghai, he was once arrested and beaten while hung up. After his release, a tumor grew on his neck, which has now healed. He said that the main reason why this hospital was able to exist during the occupation period was that there were many Japanese mental patients in the hospital.

The Pathology, Causes, and Treatment of Mental Illness Are Progressing Rapidly

Regarding the causes of mental illness, there are three distinctions: congenital, acquired, and physiological and psychological. The main reason is that self-control is too poor, and one cannot cope with unexpected blows. Diseases caused by other high-fever illnesses that injure the brain nerves, and diseases caused by syphilis also exist. There are two methods of treatment: drug treatment and work treatment. There are three drugs used for medicinal injections: (1) insulin, (2) malaria blood, and (3) Gardesol. The first drug is made from human insulin. After injection, it causes the patient to develop a high fever and become comatose and quiet. This drug is mostly used when violent patients first enter the hospital. The second type is used for patients whose brains are invaded by venereal disease bacteria, which is called "fighting poison with poison." The injection of the third drug causes the patient to develop a disease, after which the mind can be clear, but the reaction is strong, and the patient suffers greatly.

In recent years, the theory of psychoanalyst Freud has been the most valued in the study of mental illness treatment. His view is "sex." He said that due to excessive suppression of sexual aspects, a certain desire lurking in the subconscious is vented in a different way, thus becoming a madman. An example can illustrate this: there was once a patient who stomped his feet hard on the ground all day long, constantly, and the patient himself did not know why. Later, a doctor analyzed it in his dream and discovered that he had fallen in love with his sister-in-law but could not fulfill his wish. When the doctor revealed this mystery in his heart, the patient recovered. Freud's theory is based entirely on sex. He believes that women often use their own father as the standard for choosing a spouse, and men often use their own mother as the standard for choosing a spouse. According to doctors at Puchi Sanatorium, this theory attracted their attention and research several years ago. Now, everyone believes that this theory is too biased.

A mental patient sits blankly all day without saying a word. When someone arrives, they stand up, bow, and then sit blankly.

Putting Patients' Psychology on the Right Track Is the Most Effective Treatment

The latest treatment method, it is said, focuses on analyzing the patient's psychology (if it is an acquired mental illness). Many patients suffer from mental illness because they do not get what they want. Then, the treatment method should be aimed at the root of the disease. The latest treatment method does not rely solely on drugs, but putting the patient's psychology on the right track is the most effective method. For example, work therapy, using tools similar to Chinese tangrams to test the patient's psychology and guide the patient's thinking, are all more advanced methods. In the United States, the country spends 738.5 million US dollars on mental patients every year, which shows the government's attention. Their treatment methods are, of course, changing with each passing day.

The above report focuses on the Puchi Sanatorium because it is the only complete mental hospital in the Far East. And many families have members who suffer from mental illness, but they do not know where to send them.

The Red Cross's Department of Mental Diseases Has Thirty Beds

In the urban area of Shanghai, there is also the Department of Mental Diseases of the Chinese Red Cross, which also has thirty beds. As for the "Shanghai Mental Hospital," because it is privately run, funding is extremely difficult. Although it has a history of more than twenty years, the current situation is extremely poor. The reporter visited the hospital, but there was almost nothing worth reporting.

"Mental illness, a disease of civilization. People in civilized societies should pay attention to their mental health." This is what Dr. Liu Yide, a specialist in mental illness, said. "People who can control themselves, adapt to the environment, and meet the standards of most people do not have mental illness! People who can enjoy but also endure hardship, and who are not dominated by external stimuli! We believe that such people are the most physically and mentally healthy, and have the highest character! The occurrence of mental illness is mainly due to whether one is healthy or not, and external stimuli are only the fuse!" This is what another mental health specialist, Zhang Yuanchang, said. These words seem to be worthy of reference.

### Venereal Disease Hospital

— Our Reporter Dingshan

Just as gambling dens are surrounded by countless pawnshops and pledge shops, the so-called "red-light district" of Xizang Road, 2nd and 3rd Mafu Road is full of venereal disease hospitals.

A losing gambler who walks out of a gambling den can take off his handcuffs, gold ring, and gown and exchange them at a pawnshop for gambling money, in preparation for another round. He considers it a convenience no matter what. He doesn't care about the high-interest exploitation.

Similarly, for those who like to indulge in prostitution, they first go to a nearby hospital for a preventative shot before anything happens. If they contract a disease afterward, they get a "606" injection. These cheap hospitals that "guarantee a cure and complete eradication" are their perfect destination.

However, please forgive me for saying something disrespectful to certain "Doctors of Medicine" who have "studied in Germany" or "studied in the United States." Venereal disease and tuberculosis are their only shortcuts to making a living and getting rich. Many doctors rely on prostitutes, dancers, and other people who sell their bodies as a way to make a living.

In the "red-light district," you can see small storefronts with white-painted glass windows that say "Guaranteed Cure for Gonorrhea, Syphilis," etc. at any time and anywhere. Suppose you are a patient and you run into that white and dirty threshold. You will find that it is a messy little reception room. At this time, you lose the feeling of being in a "hospital." Smart doctors use partitions to divide a small room into two rooms. The inner room is the consulting room, which is probably the smallest and most crowded hospital in the world. The messy furniture and medical equipment are so crowded that there is not even room for two or three people to stand. At that time, if you tell the doctor that you have gonorrhea, he will immediately ask you to take off your pants. (At this time, you have already paid the 1,000 yuan registration fee.) Second, he will ask you to take a blood test. He will draw a lot of your blood, and the blood test fee you have to pay is probably four or five thousand yuan. He takes the blood to a specialized testing laboratory, from which he can get a commission on the blood test fee.

The third step is that he will scare you. He says that you have a fairly severe case of syphilis, but it will be fine after he treats it. He speaks very smoothly. If you have chancroid, he will say that soft chancre is guaranteed to heal in three days, and hard chancre is also very easy to heal. If you have gonorrhea, he will say that acute gonorrhea will be effective with one injection, and chronic gonorrhea can also be quickly eradicated. He wants you to get an injection, and the injection fee is up to him. If you really don't have a disease, he will use glucose to replace it. There are different ingredients for syphilis injections, depending on the person's physique, such as 0.4, 0.45, 0.6, etc. They will also trick you with the injections to get your money. Because they don't welcome you buying medicine outside.

Some advertising doctors call for cheap prices. If it were as they said, the transportation cost would not be enough. How is it possible to ask for genuine goods and complete eradication? In the past, the Medical Association had restrictions on members from publishing long-term advertisements, but now, this regulation has been virtually eliminated, and most of these doctors have not joined the association, so they do not need to be restricted by this regulation.

Shanghai's venereal disease doctors can be roughly divided into four types: (1) doctors who sell Chinese patent medicines, who sell medicines such as kidney-tonifying pills and Longhu Dan, and earn money by selling medicines. Their customers are mostly from the countryside. They also give injections, but they are Chinese acupuncture injections. (2) Venereal disease doctors with semi-Chinese and semi-Western four-room storefronts along Xizang Road account for most of Shanghai's venereal disease doctors. The descriptions are roughly as above, and there are also some experienced and effective doctors among them. (3) Venereal disease doctors with real skills. Their customers are mostly ladies from well-known families, good women, and concubines, because they are concerned about their face and it is inconvenient to publicize it. Like these doctors, three or four customers a year are enough to cover their expenses. In addition, they rely on stockpiles of Western aphrodisiacs. (4) Formal venereal disease doctors in public hospitals.

Now, on the one hand, the Health Bureau is registering doctors, and those who are unqualified will be banned. On the other hand, the police are also starting to ban dancing and prostitution. The business of these doctors and "doctors" will be greatly affected, or even completely eliminated. This is inevitable.

### Reader Q&A: Legal Queries

(1) Mr. Xian Zhijie asks: My late father ran a rice shop. A certain Mr. Jia operated a restaurant, and through business dealings, accumulated a debt of 542 silver dollars for rice. At the time, a receipt from the Jiangtan area was used as collateral. Later, Mr. Jia intentionally delayed payment. My mother then filed a lawsuit with the authorities. Because the defendant avoided appearing in court, the receipt and silver money ledger were submitted to the Baoshan County authorities for investigation. Subsequently, the Baoshan County government ruled that Mr. Jia should pay the debt in full at once, with the litigation costs borne by the defendant. However, the defendant avoids meeting, making enforcement impossible. Now, Mr. Jia wants to ask someone to mediate. How should we proceed? Please answer: (1) The debt was incurred in 1924. Because the defendant avoided meeting, enforcement was impossible. At that time, I was still an infant, so it was never handled. Will the debt become invalid due to the lapse of time? (2) The original debt was 542 silver dollars. Currently, repayment cannot be based on the rice price and silver dollars. However, according to legal regulations, what is the total amount of principal and interest? (3) If converted to legal tender for repayment, it would be very advantageous to the defendant, but I would suffer a great loss. Is there any legal remedy? (4) The collateral receipt was lost when submitted to the Baoshan County government. Can I apply for a replacement and take possession of the property? (5) Can I hire a lawyer to handle it?

[Lawyer Duanmu Kai answers:] (1) It will not become invalid due to the lapse of time. (2) (3) Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation After Restoration, which governs cases with a final verdict, appears difficult to invoke. (4) If the collateral is not redeemed according to the judgment, you can petition for compulsory execution to auction the collateral. If the practicing certificate is lost, it can be requested. (5) You may hire a lawyer to handle it.

(2) Mr. Wang Xiren from Wuxi asks: When a certain Mr. (omitted) was dying, he wrote three copies of his will. The first and last copies were lost, leaving only the middle page. It was written in pencil and unsigned. Of the two brothers, one acknowledges the will, while the other denies it. Does this will have any validity? Please answer in the Social Services section.

[Lawyer Duanmu Kai answers:] A handwritten will that does not meet the signature requirements is not valid according to Article 1190 of the Civil Code.

(3) Mr. Chen Zhongxing asks: In the first half of 1944, due to urgent needs, I borrowed 100,000 yuan of counterfeit currency from a friend. There was no written agreement. Now my friend is demanding repayment. I don't know how to handle it or what the repayment method should be. Here are three points, please answer. I would be extremely grateful. (1) Is it reasonable to repay 100,000 yuan of national currency for the 100,000 yuan of counterfeit currency I borrowed? (2) If my friend wants to settle the debt based on the price of goods in 1944, is that legal? What can I do to deal with it? (3) If my friend sues me, how should I respond?

[Lawyer Duanmu Kai answers:] It is best to resolve it through mutual agreement. Otherwise, it should be fairly assessed by the court in accordance with Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation After Restoration, increasing the payment.

### Service Briefs

Motorized Vehicle for Newspaper Delivery: To improve delivery efficiency, the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau will use motorized bicycles for newspaper delivery, but due to the limited number of vehicles, it will only be used for important and express telegrams. This method is being used for the first time in our country.

Lost and Found: I found a service card of Navy Wang Yixi of the Chu Guan warship at the Dashijie tram station at around 11 PM on the 26th of last month. It has been handed over to ticket seller number 31 of the French Tramway Company for safekeeping. The owner is requested to go there to inquire and claim it.

Huguo Free Clinic and Pharmacy: Abbot Langting of the Huguo Chan Monastery (i.e., Laoximen Guandi Temple) on Fuxing East Road, along with local gentry Huang Jinrong, Fan Kaitai, Chen Qiguang, and colleagues from the National Medicine Industry Association and the Herbal Medicine Industry Association, have established the "Huguo Free Clinic and Pharmacy," which opened at the beginning of this month. The clinic is open from 9 AM to 12 PM and 2 PM to 5 PM daily, and all medical and pharmaceutical expenses are waived.

Free Clinic and Pharmacy: Traditional Chinese medicine practitioner Cao Xiwan has established a clinic at No. 8 Changqing Lane, Datong Road, and is now offering free medical services and medication, from 8 AM to 11 AM daily.

Free Furuncle Medicine: Jicangzhai's family-secret, special-effect furuncle medicine can stop pain and promote healing with just one application for all kinds of furuncles. This medicine is not for sale, but exclusively for free distribution, which has been the practice for many years. Recently, life has become more difficult, and medicine prices have increased significantly. Patients often suffer from a lack of appropriate free treatment. In view of this, I am still offering free distribution as usual. Patients can go to Lu Daren Hall at No. 21 Yongnian Lane, Baike Road, for treatment, and no consultation fee will be charged.

Xu Xiangren Offers "Treatise on Cholera"

To the Editor: I recently read in your column that cholera is severe in various places this year, and hospitals are suffering from overcrowding! I intend to donate my humble work, "Treatise on Cholera," to all sectors, but only a limited number will be available. It might be helpful. However, for Western medicine treatment, proper equipment is essential. For Chinese medicine treatment, preparing medicine is paramount. Medicines must be prepared early so that they can be used when needed. I specifically request your column to disclose this. Respectfully, Xu Xiangren of the Shanghai Daily Social Services Column (Address: No. 17, Lane 796, Beijing Road)

### Direct Tax Bureau Messengers Must Not Collect Taxes on Behalf of Taxpayers

Violators Will Be Severely Punished: It has been reported that some merchants in this city, after receiving tax payment notices from this Bureau, have entrusted the Bureau's messengers to submit tax payments to the national treasury. This practice easily leads to abuses. To prevent this, this Bureau has strictly instructed its messengers to absolutely not accept tax payments on behalf of taxpayers, otherwise they will be severely punished. It is hoped that when businesses in this city receive tax payment notices, they will submit the tax payments to the national treasury themselves, and not entrust the Bureau's messengers to pay on their behalf, to avoid abuses. Please disclose this in your column. Respectfully, Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance to the Shanghai Daily Social Services Department

### Mrs. Marshall's Life in Lushan

— Special Correspondent Xie Baozhu, Dispatch from Kuling, Day One

Since the Five-Star General arrived on the mountain, undoubtedly, the political atmosphere of Lushan has begun to pervade.

Amidst this pervading atmosphere, reporters are striving to discern the movements of these five stars – General Marshall’s life.

Of course, the activities of Mrs. Marshall are also something the general public is keen to know about. Here, we record some snippets about Mrs. Marshall's movements.

If you want to know what time Mrs. Marshall gets up every day, we can tell you here: she is an early riser. Half past seven in the morning is her standard wake-up time. Before she gets out of bed, one essential routine is to drink a cup of black coffee. Two lightly boiled eggs, three slices of toast, a cup of coffee, and some fruit – that’s Mrs. Marshall’s breakfast, usually taken around half past nine.

After lunch, Mrs. Marshall invariably takes a nap. Her lunch is quite simple: two pieces of chicken or steak, some cold vegetables – carrots, potatoes, green beans – and then a glass of watermelon juice or other fruit juice, and that’s it. Mrs. Marshall doesn’t want to become a plump lady. After a nap of no more than two hours, it’s tea time, which consists of a cup of cocoa and a few biscuits. Dinner is usually eaten at half past seven, and it's even lighter than lunch. Although she should have ample time to rest and recuperate in this quiet and leisurely environment, Mrs. Marshall still doesn’t go to bed until around eleven o’clock. Perhaps this is because she cares about her husband and helps him with his work.

The deep affection and mutual respect between the Marshalls are as strong as during their honeymoon period, as has long been known to the general readership.

Mrs. Marshall is constantly mindful of Mr. Marshall's every move, taking care of him meticulously. She always feels that since Mr. Marshall came to China, he has been working in a tense atmosphere, striving for the realization of Chinese peace, and doing a very great work. Therefore, she is eager to share some of his hardships and make his life a little easier. When she came up the mountain this time, she specially brought him a set of grayish-blue western-style clothes to change into, and then told him: "Now, you can finally take off that five-star general's uniform and avoid restricting yourself all day long."

And Mr. Marshall? He also thinks of his wife’s boredom and loneliness on the mountain at all times and feels very sorry, so he specially brought a set of checkers to relieve her boredom. Whenever he has a little time, he plays checkers with his wife. If she loses, she always insists on playing another game.

During the period when Mr. Marshall was away from Kuling, she would call Nanjing at least twice a day to ask about her husband's well-being. Especially when she knew that Mr. Marshall was coming up the mountain that day, she had already instructed the cook to prepare her husband's favorite dishes, and kept sending people to the radio station to inquire about the time of his arrival on the mountain, and then personally rode a sedan chair to the top of the mountain, looking up and waiting for him.

Besides sometimes inviting Chairman Chiang and his wife over for dinner, Mrs. Marshall hasn’t formally invited any guests for a banquet since coming to the mountain. Before lunch or after tea, she often strolls around the vicinity with Chairman Chiang and his wife, or goes on picnics with them, or chats with Mrs. Chiang, appreciating flowers, playing checkers, and strolling down the street. Sometimes she goes for a walk alone with her maid, or goes to the street to see the scenery and buy some small trinkets.

Mrs. Marshall is not only a capable wife, but also a talented and versatile writer. She often writes and reads in her spare time, and helps her husband organize documents.

Kindness, friendliness, democracy, and generosity are all reasons why many people admire and respect Mrs. Marshall. Everyone who has worked for her praises her for her good treatment of people. She treats people of all classes – upper, middle, and lower – equally. If the attendants around her make a mistake, she not only doesn’t scold them, but also gives them encouragement and comfort. No wonder the people around her say: "Even a very bad person will become a good person if they work by her side." Do you know to what extent she cares about her subordinates? If she asks them why they only ate two slices of toast for breakfast, she will immediately force them to eat all the breakfast she is eating, and wait for the cook to make another portion for herself.

Mrs. Marshall treats her maid with extra care, treating her like a friend, often talking and chatting with her, telling her stories from her childhood, and even telling her how she and Mr. Marshall got married, and all the happy circumstances of their honeymoon. Speaking of this maid, she is a simple woman in her thirties, who speaks Shanghai dialect and can also speak better English than pidgin English. The maid envies Mrs. Marshall for having such a good husband, and people envy the maid for having such a good mistress.

We cannot deny that a husband's gains, losses, success, and failure are often greatly influenced by his wife. The reason why Mr. Marshall has five stars shining on his shoulders is that his wife's contribution cannot be ignored.

### The First Grand Concert in the Capital After the Return to Nanjing: General Marshall and the U.S. Ambassador Attended and Were Greatly Appreciative

— Reporter Pu Dejie, Dispatch from Nanjing, July 25th

On the evening of July 24th, the desolate and deserted gate of the National Assembly Hall suddenly became lively again. Large cars, small cars, jeeps, and pedicabs were densely packed on both sides of the wide road. Inside and outside the hall's lobby, the lights were bright, and ladies were as numerous as clouds. Many well-dressed gentlemen and ladies were smiling and talking; some wore orange silk ribbons, indicating they were hosts; some held elegant invitation cards, indicating they were guests. Starting from eight o'clock, they swept away the bad luck that had surrounded this magnificent building for the past few months.

(1) Overflowing with Joy

This was the first grand concert in Nanjing after the return to the capital, and the first time the National Assembly Hall had been filled with joy after the victory. The performance featured high-class classical music, and the guests invited were important figures and cultured individuals from Nanjing. Everything was high society and everyone displayed elegant manners.

The atmosphere in the hall was beautiful. Gentlemen and ladies sat in comfortable spring seats, greeting acquaintances politely. Hostesses greeted guests and directed them to their assigned seats. Everyone spoke softly, walked softly, and gently pointed out the simple yet grand decorations and furnishings on the stage. A large purple-red velvet curtain hung down from the high stage opening, shimmering with light. On it were two rows of words cut from white paper: "Organized by the Central Propaganda Department of the Central Cultural Movement Committee" and "Musical Performance." Another row had the English names of the two organizing bodies. In the center was a dazzling and mysterious, faintly silvery-purple harp, and two narcissus flowers were arranged on either side. At the bottom was a row of English names: "Musical Visiting Group." In the center of the stage was a black grand piano, and two deep yellow velvet-cushioned chairs. On the stage opening were six flower baskets full of carnations and roses, arranged symmetrically. In a word, it was a beautiful stage setting. When the music began, people would forget all the troubles outside this building.

(2) Director's Speech

The chief guest was Marshal Marshall, who arrived at the venue at 8:40 PM. He was immediately invited to the upstairs lounge by the host. By this time, most of the seats in the venue were occupied. The old guard of the party and the officials of the government mostly sat on the right, while the figures of the Youth Party, the Communist Party, and the Democratic League were mostly on the left. Many envoys from friendly countries came, and many people from the cultural world also came. The reporters were quite active, but everyone understood that in this situation, it was best not to mention those difficult topics, because everyone was looking at the stage, waiting to hear beautiful music.

At 8:50 PM, Chairman Zhang Daofan of the Cultural Movement Committee, delivered a speech on behalf of the hosts. He sincerely thanked the landlords and performers for their kindness, and also thanked the guests for their presence. He said that he hoped that this visit abroad by the visiting group would show the achievements of China's new music to friendly countries and overseas Chinese, and at the same time, it could bring back the techniques of Western music to beautify and purify China's music. Finally, he politely apologized to everyone that the air-conditioning equipment of the hall was not yet installed, causing everyone to feel hot. But in fact, it was a very cool and pleasant evening!

(3) Music Begins

At 8:55 PM, the lights in the hall dimmed. The hall was pitch black for a short period of time. At the same time, there was not even a slight sound of footsteps or conversation. The lighting lamp on the right lit up first, followed by the one on the lower left, and then the one on the left. Millions of lines of sight were focused on the stage. Mr. Ma Sicong walked out of the curtain seam on the left, wearing a white shirt, a white flower bow tie, a white suit jacket, dark green trousers, and white leather shoes. His youthful, bright eyes and polite demeanor earned him applause. Following him were pianist Ms. Ma Sisun and another lady to take care of the sheet music, wearing the same green floral cheongsam and white shoes. The music began with two violin pieces by Mr. Ma Sicong. "Nostalgia" was gentle and tender, causing many people to lower their heads and close their eyes; "Spinning Tune" was joyful and lively, reminding people of the famous "Hungarian Dance." The first program ended with applause.

(4) Soprano Solo

The second program was tenor solo by Mr. Huang Yuanyin. In addition to wearing a black bow tie, his attire was the same as Mr. Ma's. With a short stature and a broad chest, he looked like a singer at first glance. He sang three songs in a row, each earning applause. His tone was very beautiful, his range was wide, and his emotional expression was well-honed. Especially the third song, "Tosca! Aria," made people believe that if the composer Puccini, the ancient Italian composer of the seventeenth century, could be resurrected to listen to this song, he would definitely shake hands with him.

The third program was a piano solo by Ms. Wu Leyi. She wore a light rose-red silk cheongsam with large white and dark purple flowers and white shoes. Her appearance aroused applause. She smiled and sat in front of the piano with the lid already open, tried a few notes, and then began to play. Her ten fingers jumped lightly and skillfully on the keys, playing three famous pieces: Rachmaninoff's "Prelude in G Minor," Albeniz's "Cordova," and Lecuona's "Malaguena." Accompanying the sonorous piano sounds was enthusiastic applause. A little girl presented a bouquet of flowers. In the applause, Ms. Wu smiled and accepted it, and repeatedly thanked the guests. This was at 9:35 PM. The first half of the program was over, and it was intermission time.

(5) Marshal's Interest

At this moment, Ambassador Stuart and Mr. Fu Jingbo arrived. They went upstairs. After the ambassador shook hands with the special envoy, he sat in the second row on the left. Special Envoy Marshall was very interested in music. He applauded and praised after each program. His seat changed from the first row to the fourth row and the fifth row, but always on the right side. In addition, upstairs were Ambassador Petrov, Mr. and Mrs. Shao Lizi, President Long Yun, and several hosts, as well as some socialite ladies – most of them took silk fans and asked the special envoy to sign his name. The special envoy smiled and listened quietly.

The ten-minute intermission passed, and the program started again. Mr. Huang Yuanyin sang three more Chinese songs: Mr. Zhao Yuanren's "How Can I Not Think of Her," Mr. Xia Zhiqiu's "Nostalgia," and Mr. Huang Zi's posthumous work "Family Ethics." These three lyrical songs with distinct emotions, which everyone knew, were warmly welcomed. Especially "Nostalgia," it made many listeners lower their heads. In this magnificent and splendid place, it aroused a trace of thoughts, making many people think of their hometowns that they could not return to; needless to say, this song caused a great applause. The fifth program was a piano solo. Ms. Wu used her exquisite and skilled technique to first play Chopin's "Berceuse." This great Polish musician, like Mozart, had experienced all kinds of suffering in his short, genius-filled years, but wrote only beautiful and joyful songs. This was a happy and peaceful song, making people feel the coming of angels, indulging in silent peace, so that everyone forgot to applaud at the end of the song. Next, she played Liszt's "Rigoletto-Paraphrase," and she ended her program in a storm of applause.

(6) Violin Solo

The sixth program, and also the last program, was another violin solo by Mr. Ma Sicong. Schubert's "Ave Maria" and Kreisler's "Tambourin Chinois." These two songs allowed the violinist to fully express his skills. The fluency of the latter and the distantness of the former were precisely a contrast. Mr. Ma easily portrayed them separately. Especially the double strings in the second half of "Ave Maria" were enough to be compared with Ma Sicong. "Chinese Flower Drum" is a violin piece that has been beautified and purified from folk songs, but it only retains a small amount of Chinese folk flavor. It seems that this kind of work of extracting the essence of folk art and reproducing it still needs to be done by ourselves.

At 10:20 PM, the program ended, and the guests left one after another, each with a satisfied smile on their lips. Indeed, it was a quite successful concert. Several young artists will have a bright future.

The traffic in front of the National Assembly Hall gradually dispersed, and everything returned to tranquility, but on this night, several sounds of different emotions were echoing in my ears: the gentleness and resentment of "Nostalgia," the piety and prayer of "Ave Maria," the peace and happiness of "Berceuse"..., I saw pictures emerging in front of my eyes, from suffering to happiness. I hope this is a lucky portrayal of the tortured compatriots who were temporarily forgotten in the magnificent and joyful venue.

### Glimpses of London

— London Airmail of July 21st, Special Correspondent Xueyan for This Newspaper

From today onwards, bread in the entire United Kingdom can no longer be freely purchased. Each person can only buy within their allocated ration. Approximately six slices per person per day will be allowed, with corresponding fixed amounts for other flour-based products like noodles. According to some British newspapers, Britain's food situation is now the most difficult in the white world. It's unexpected that bread, which was exempt from rationing during the war, is now subject to strict restrictions a year after the war ended. Because this new system affects everyone in the country, interest is very widespread. Every household discusses it, and newspapers feature it with large headlines every day. Opposition party members are using this as good material for party strife, taking every opportunity to prove the Labor Party's incompetence. They always imply, "Look, the Conservative Party could solve the problem during wartime, but the Labor Party can't even handle it during peacetime." The Conservative Party newspapers naturally add fuel to the fire, constantly reminding the people of the government's weakness. After the news of the decision to implement bread rationing spread, the most flustered were the bakers. They formed groups and requested to see the Minister of Food to lodge a serious protest. However, all the minister could do was politely explain and frankly point out the scarcity of food reserves and the global prevalence of famine, saying that it was like "a clever housewife cannot cook without rice." The government's decision to implement rationing was a last resort, and it would be canceled as soon as the situation improved. Another group of people who are uneasy are the ladies and housewives who manage the household affairs. They have also formed the British Housewives' League and often go to argue with the Ministry of Food. The actual amount of food reserves in Britain has always been a secret. Some people speculate that it is enough for at least a year. However, recent circumstances have forced the truth to be revealed. It is said that there are only eight weeks of food reserves left. It is still uncertain where the supply will come from after eight weeks, so implementing rationing is truly a necessary measure.

Successful Loan

On the eve of implementing bread rationing, the successful acquisition of a nearly four billion US dollar loan from the United States gave people a glimmer of hope for improving living conditions. It passed smoothly in the House of Commons and has now been signed by the US President, becoming a formal law that can be implemented immediately. The government has already carefully planned the steps for utilizing this loan. It is said that most of it will be used to purchase machinery and parts to accelerate production, while only a small portion will be used to improve living conditions, with food and printed materials like paper being prioritized. The Chancellor of the Exchequer put it well, "This loan gives the British people a chance to breathe. It should be seen as a springboard for restoring prosperity, not a sofa for comfortably enjoying the fruits of labor." Here, we should note that Britain is the most on track and fastest-recovering country among the major powers after the war. It cannot be measured by our country's domestic standards. Even the United States, a country with abundant resources, is experiencing continuous labor strikes, making its industrial recovery slower than Britain's. According to the Overseas Trade Department's report, Britain's export trade has not only exceeded expectations but also surpassed pre-war levels. Currently, Britain's situation is that life is relatively difficult domestically, and it is vigorously promoting its products abroad to compete for the still unstable post-war world market. This loan from the United States further accelerates its expansion of overseas trade. However, unfortunately, the day the loan was obtained also coincided with a surge in US prices. It is said that from the day the loan was agreed upon until the day it was approved by the US House of Representatives, US prices have risen by approximately 30%, which means that the real value of the loan has fallen by approximately 30%. If the prices are low on the day the debt is repaid, then Britain's intangible losses will be significant. Therefore, the British government is not planning to use most of this loan during this period of high prices. It plans to use only a quarter of it, about one billion US dollars, this year, and wait for a better time for the rest. Although this loan is now in hand, the negotiation process was tortuous and difficult. While the United States knew that Britain needed help and was willing to lend, it clearly saw this loan as part of a policy to develop world trade, attacking Britain's imperial preference and the sterling bloc as conditions for the loan. Therefore, the negotiations took a long time, and there were several times when there was a danger of breakdown. Lord Keynes, the genius of British economics, is said to have died from overwork while negotiating this loan. Even after reaching an agreement with the US administrative authorities, there were several times when there was a danger of being rejected during the legislative process. The US government almost used all its strength to support its safe passage. Therefore, while the British government is full of hope for this loan to alleviate its current predicament, it is not entirely dependent on it. It is said that after agreeing to the loan, the British Treasury immediately began preparing two parallel plans for either success or failure of the loan, the latter of which was abandoned only after the US House of Representatives approved the loan.

Enlightened Measures

Although the British mainland is small, it is the oldest and largest empire in the world. Its colonies are all over the world, and most of Africa is its property. However, this empire has been able to stand firm because it has its strengths, namely, it can often recognize the trends of the times and prevent hidden dangers before they occur. For example, since the Labor Party came to power this time, it has implemented socialism within the country to eliminate the differences between the rich and the poor. At the same time, it also has a set of enlightened measures for the colonies. For example, the recent plan to allow India to become independent and help it form an autonomous government is the most obvious example. Other examples include allowing the withdrawal of troops stationed in Egypt and granting independence to Transjordan, all of which are manifestations of this enlightened trend. Although we also know that the independence granted by Britain is practically no different from the status of a colony, it is still a step forward. Recently, because the Labor Party has been in power for a full year, a debate on colonial policy was specially held in Parliament. This was the first time since the Labor Party came to power, and both the opposition party and the government party were very enthusiastic. In addition to the post-war colonial military service demobilization, post-war construction, and a set of post-war policy clichés, both sides paid attention to the issue of improving the lives of the people in the colonies. Because the lives of the people in the colonies are difficult and cannot be compared with Europeans, they have become two completely different worlds, and they have reached a point where they cannot develop on their own. There were many improvement measures mentioned in Parliament that day, but two things were most noteworthy in the speech delivered by its Colonial Secretary Hall: (1) A bill called the Colonial and Welfare Development Act, which had already been passed last year, allocated 210 million pounds over ten years specifically for improving the welfare of the people in the colonies. It stipulated that 230 million pounds would be used specifically for improving higher education. The British Colonial Department governs a population of approximately 50 million (India does not belong to the Colonial Department). On average, each person will benefit by more than four pounds within ten years. Although the amount is very small, it is better than nothing, and it is believed that this money will definitely benefit the people in the colonies without any problems. (2) To promote the organization of trade unions in the colonies. The main reason why the people in the colonies live in hardship is that the cost of labor is low. They work hard all year round but still do not have enough to eat and keep warm. All the gains from their labor are plundered by others. Therefore, organizing labor and making them strive to improve their lives is the most fundamental way. The Labor Party started by this, so it naturally did not forget to use this set of methods. It is now said that it has sent the most experienced people to the colonies to start organizing. It is hoped that there will be achievements in the future. Although there are new ideas in other political and construction aspects, there are no major characteristics.

Political Propaganda

People in politics pay attention to propaganda. How the power and effectiveness of propaganda actually are is difficult to estimate, but there is absolutely no question about how glaring propaganda can be. Since the British Labor Party has been in power, many party members have always wanted to use the opportunity of their current power to improve their propaganda position within the country. The issue of amending the charter of the British Broadcasting Corporation has been going on for almost a year, and there is still no final conclusion. According to a recent statement by the British Lord President of the Council, Morrison, the intention is to appoint a committee including all the major parties to investigate where the company's charter should be amended, but the results of the investigation will be considered when the charter expires next time. For the time being, the original charter will be allowed to be extended for five years (expiring at the end of December this year.) The British Broadcasting Corporation is a government-licensed monopoly broadcasting company. Its charter was issued by the government and began in 1926. It has been twenty years since then. Although the company's business has changed greatly now and in the past, the charter provisions are generally the same.

Recently, some people in the Labor Party have also paid attention to the newspaper issue, believing that the shares of current newspapers are in the hands of a few people, which is suspected of monopolizing and being biased, and losing the original intention of public opinion fairness. The government should conduct investigations and improvements. Currently, the newspaper with the most power in Britain is the Times. This newspaper has extremely high standards, but its circulation is not large, and its arguments are relatively fair. The newspapers with the widest circulation are the Daily Express (daily circulation of more than 3.7 million copies) and the Daily Mail, both of which are run by the Conservative Party, but they focus on social news, and their political influence is not great. The left-wing newspapers are the Daily Herald, which is the Labor Party's party newspaper, the Daily Worker, which is the Communist Party's party newspaper, and the News Chronicle, which, although a Liberal Party newspaper, is also slightly left-leaning. According to neutral statistics, although the total circulation of left-wing newspapers currently does not catch up with the right-wing, the difference between the two totals is not too large. Moreover, even when right-wing newspapers have a sales advantage, the election results are not affected, which shows that the effectiveness of propaganda is not as great as imagined. The problem is that the ruling party feels uncomfortable when enemy newspapers launch attacks. It is said that in the past, when MacDonald and Churchill were prime ministers, they both had the same feelings and plans, but after careful consideration, they were not implemented. Therefore, it is hoped that the Labor Party can maintain this tradition after taking power. The main condition of democratic politics is that the ruling party can tolerate criticism and accept criticism. Therefore, although this issue has now been raised by some members of the Labor Party, it is feared that it will not be supported by the government and is unlikely to pass. However, it shows that many members of the Labor Party have this tendency.

### Three Things in Shenyang: Horse Manure, Garbage, and Water and Electricity

— Airmail of July 26th from This Newspaper, Special Correspondent Han Qingtao for the Northeast

Shenyang lacks electricity, so trams cannot run. Gasoline is scarce, and automobiles are also limited, so horse-drawn carts, handcarts, and tricycles are popular. On the main roads, the "clippety-clop" of horses' hooves can be heard every day from morning to night, making it impossible to relax. In addition, it has created a phenomenon of "horse manure all over the streets, and the stench of manure rising with the wind."

Horse Manure All Over the Streets

Reporters from the inland areas often report this matter to various places. The first impression people have when they come to Shenyang is also about horse-drawn carts and horse manure, which makes Mayor Dong Wenqi anxious and the municipal health personnel busy. Someone came up with a solution to order the cart owners to hang an iron bucket behind each horse's buttocks, but there was still a lot of horse manure because the manure could not completely fall into the bucket, and the cart drivers often secretly dumped the manure that fell into the bucket on the street.

More than 11,000 horse-drawn carts and iron handcarts run on the streets, and more than 700 street sweepers from the city government sweep the streets every day. Not only has the problem of horse manure not been rationally resolved, but also the roads, which are related to horses' hooves and cart wheels, have also become "uneven."

Automobiles and Trams

After several months of effort, this annoying matter has finally made some progress. That is, the city government has repaired six automobiles, which run on the road from Dongguan to the Zhongchang Road Station. It is possible to collect and repair 25 to 30 broken automobiles from the suburbs by August, and there will be more passengers.

Shenyang has a total of six tram lines, with a total length of 35 kilometers and more than 30 trams. 17 of them have now been repaired. It has been decided to start 12 of them on August 1st. The electricity used is supplied by the Ordnance Factory, where 700 to 800 kilowatts of electricity can be sent out. Trams will run during the day and provide lighting for the main streets at night.

In this way, the problem of transportation for most of the residents in the city has been largely solved. Horse-drawn carts and large carts will be banned from carrying passengers in the urban area. The city government's plan is to call on them to develop in the rural areas. This will not only facilitate the transportation between the urban and rural areas, but also solve most of the horse manure problem. On the other hand, it will encourage them to go to Fushun to transport coal, in order to solve the coal shortage in winter.

30,000 Tons of Garbage

Along with horse manure, the "garbage problem" is also uncomfortable. This matter not only damages environmental hygiene and affects the health of citizens, but also pollutes the city's appearance. According to the Health Bureau's investigation, there are currently 109 large piles of garbage, with a volume of about 40,000 cubic feet and a weight of more than 30,000 tons.

Mayor Dong said: This is a heavy burden on his shoulders. In addition to the fundamental solution, he decided to hold a three-day city-wide clean-up in Shenyang from July 29th, mobilizing all citizens to participate in this activity. In addition, he has agreed with the Commander-in-Chief's Office to allocate 20 trucks to start transporting garbage outwards from densely populated areas and gradually expand the clean-up work.

In terms of the fundamental solution, it has been decided to repair the damaged gas factory. The machinery is currently being repaired, and it is expected that three plants will be repaired by the end of September, which can supply about 10,000 households for cooking. This can reduce the gradual increase of garbage. It is heard that the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is using the "work-for-food" method to allocate flour and funds, totaling about 6.9 million yuan, to solve many of the city government's economic difficulties in cleaning up garbage and repairing the gas factory.

Clean Water Does Not Flow Out

The "water" needed for the city's main drinking and cleaning purposes is also a problem. In the urban area, most people use the so-called "foreign wells" to fetch water, and some places draw water from old-fashioned large wells, so the problem is small. The problem lies in the Heping District, because the tap water facilities have mostly become decorations, and many water pipes have not flowed water for a long time.

People living upstairs have to carry water up to the upper floors bucket by bucket, and the excrement in the flush toilets also has to be flushed with water. In many places, the toilets are stinking. The reporter stayed in a hospital that had such a situation. All hygiene facilities have lost their effectiveness because there is no water.

The water source for Shenyang has only been completely restored at the moment, but because of insufficient electricity, only the Beiling, Wanquan, and Shasan water sources can supply electricity for five or six hours a day, and the total water supply is less than 10,000 tons, which is less than one-seventh of the previous water supply. The Tawan water source will also be opened in the near future. In addition, it is planned to build another water source in Tiexi to increase the water supply. It is also planned to discuss with the Changchun Railway Bureau to allocate its water sources to Shenyang for use, so that everyone can enjoy "like a fish in water" when the electricity is sufficient.

Electricity Is the Key

Water, manure, and garbage all directly or indirectly require electricity. Electricity is related to the entire Shenyang's recovery of health, as well as its future development and prosperity. The thermal power plants in Fushun and parts of Shenyang can only solve a small part of the supply. The city government is currently planning to buy several electric motors of more than 300 horsepower from Japan to help with the emergency.

The power source for Shenyang from the Yalu River has no hope of being transmitted. Although the Xiaofengman power plant in Jilin is in the hands of the National Army, the transmission line passes through a small part of the Communist Army's area, such as the line north of Meihekou—from Chaoyang Town to Panshi—and the south of Meihekou—Shancheng Town to Qingyuan. According to Wang Yuxin, the leader of the Commander-in-Chief's Power Supply Repair Team, many power transmission line towers south of Meihekou have been destroyed by the Communist Army. At the same time, he also personally saw them carrying out planned destruction operations. The Xiaofengman power source cannot be sent south, which has caused a surplus of power north of Siping Street.

When Lin Biao, representing Li Lisan, arrived in Shenyang, reporters asked him about the transmission of electricity from Xiaofengman to Shenyang. He said, "It is a small problem," but everyone earnestly hopes that this small problem can be resolved as soon as possible so that factories can be revived and people can have a good life.

### Small News from Lushan

— Airmail from Guling for This Newspaper, Special Correspondent Xie Baozhu

On the day Marshal Marshall went up the mountain for the second time, Chairman Chiang and his wife personally went to the street to buy two green porcelain ducks, each more than an inch long, to give to Marshal and Mrs. Marshall for their enjoyment. These ducks are small and exquisite, and Marshal and Mrs. Marshall were extremely happy to receive them. It is said that the two ducks cost a total of 3,000 yuan.

On the evening of the 28th, Chairman Chiang felt slightly unwell, with a slight fever and chills, but he still attended the Summer Camp Commemorative Week and the opening ceremony of the Jiangxi Summer Academic Lecture Series the next day despite his illness. After returning to his residence, he followed his doctor's orders and needed to rest. On this day, his wife was always at his service and did not go out all day, not even into the garden.

Reporters from various newspapers in Lushan, in addition to being nervous about reporting news all day, have also developed a great interest in photography. Some bring their own cameras, while others borrow them. Once the results are developed, everyone competes to visit and exclaim "Excellent, excellent!" or "What a pity, what a pity."

A foreigner lives in the Hujin Fang Hotel who does not speak Chinese. Before every meal, he buries himself and laboriously flips through his English-Chinese bilingual dictionary. However, after fumbling for a long time, he still cannot say what he wants to eat. Even if he says it, the Jiangxi waiters still do not understand. But he is almost starving. As a last resort, the waiters can only ask the reporters to be temporary interpreters. Fortunately, this gentleman is waiting for a boat and will go down the mountain to Xunyang and then to Shanghai soon. Otherwise, he would be racking his brains every day, which would really defeat the purpose of going up the mountain for rest.

The police here have a very "leisurely" style. There are not many pedestrians on the street, and there are very few fights. There are no rickshaw licenses to pry and no paralyzed vendors to drive away. They only stand guard and stand at attention when important people go up the mountain.

Liang Hancao is very interested in poetry. On the day he climbed the mountain, he recited a poem to a friend, which was written nine years ago. The poem says: "Exploring the Five Elders up the Yangtze River again, still difficult when climbing, the sinking boat in the East China Sea, a past regret, rowing in the middle stream, profound at this moment. Green trees along the river grow lush, floating clouds cover the sun, illusory and sunny, thunder and lightning wait for tomorrow, impatience, sigh ten thousand horses of disease." (30th)

### Another Step Towards Relief for Refugees

— Cheng Zheng

Recently, government authorities and social elites have been tirelessly appealing for and providing funds and food to the refugees from Northern Jiangsu, doing their utmost to provide relief. Those who benefit should naturally sing praises and be eternally grateful. Why, then, do complaints persist, even to the point of wishing for the demise of the current situation?

I have investigated the actual situation. Among the refugees, some have fled individually, while others have left with their entire families. Food, clothing, and shelter are consistently scarce. While those providing relief exert immense effort, those receiving it still feel like they are only getting a drop in the bucket. Moreover, in Northern Jiangsu in the past six months, violent mobs have seized power, advocating for the overturning of the existing order, using liquidation as a pretext, and instigating struggles. The lives and property of the people are completely unprotected, and freedom of speech and assembly is entirely lost. Those elders, siblings, and relatives who remain trapped in the fallen territory are reportedly being imprisoned for minor offenses and unjustly labeled as counter-revolutionaries. They are using old, unfounded grudges from ten or twenty years ago to ruin families, calling on tenant farmers to refuse rent and return grain, thereby seizing landlords' property. If that is not enough, they dismantle their houses and carry away their furniture, determined to strip landlords of all their possessions before they are satisfied. Those who served as heads of townships or Baojia (self-governing units) before 1940 are being detained and punished without exception. Middle peasants, wealthy peasants, middle merchants, wealthy merchants, as well as educated youths and local leaders who are not part of their faction are being framed and eliminated en masse. They are calling on young women to join the Women's Federation and forcibly comfort soldiers. Reports of those who would rather die than suffer humiliation and lose their honor are heard daily. Other tragic events, such as wearing tall hats, donning dog skins, carrying turtle shells, dragging tails, licking buttocks, and being tied up for public display, are constantly emerging in countless variations. All these things are heart-wrenching to hear and heartbreaking to see. The chaos of Huang Chao's rebellion and the brutality of Li Zicheng and Zhang Xianzhong were not this cruel. Relief organizations cannot fully solve the refugees' problems of food, clothing, and shelter, and even if they could, they still cannot alleviate the inner suffering of those who cannot return home, whose families are scattered, and who still endure the hellish existence in their villages. Therefore, their complaints and curses, as well as the previous assault in Xiaguan, driven by righteous indignation, seem understandable and not surprising.

The government halts fighting and then halts it again, negotiates for peace and then negotiates again, merely wasting time with little effect, while the refugees are becoming increasingly anxious and furious. Moreover, the prolonged stationing of troops is difficult to sustain, and the constant advances and retreats only demoralize the soldiers. Now, the Communist troops in Northern Jiangsu, in their treasonous attack on Taizhou, Taixing, and Jingjiang, have suffered setbacks. Zhou Enlai is about to travel and advocate for peace again, rehashing old tunes. If the government considers protecting and nurturing the people its responsibility, it should enforce national discipline and order the rebel troops of the New Fourth Army, whose designation was revoked long ago, to withdraw from Northern Jiangsu and relocate to designated areas, reform the style of violent mob rule, and await government reorganization, so that political and military orders are unified, internal strife is eliminated, and the nation is built together. Otherwise, if the New Fourth Army continues to disrupt the region, harming the people at will, their rebellious actions are evident, and the government should immediately condemn and suppress the rebellion, preventing it from spreading. This is a matter of military order and discipline, not a political party dispute.

### Military Vehicle Injures Someone and Flees

This morning at 8:30 AM, I hired a rickshaw from my residence on North Sichuan Road to go to the Central Bank on the Bund. While passing East Baoxing Road, I was suddenly knocked down by a military vehicle coming from behind. Both I and the rickshaw puller were knocked unconscious. By the time passersby helped us up, the military vehicle had already sped away. Upon inspection, my clothes were completely torn, worth about 100,000 yuan, and my flesh was severely injured. The rickshaw puller also suffered serious injuries, and the rickshaw was completely destroyed. The driver of the vehicle was devoid of conscience and public morality, fleeing the scene after causing the accident. My injuries and the loss of my clothes are minor matters, but the rickshaw puller's injuries and the need to compensate the rickshaw company for the loss are tragic. Recently, the city has become increasingly crowded, and traffic order is becoming more and more chaotic. Accidents are bound to occur several times a day. If the authorities do not pay attention and remedy the situation, the consequences will be unimaginable. (Yu Gongyue)

### Distinguishing Rottenness and Magic

After reading the article "Transforming Rottenness into Magic" published in your column, I have some humble opinions to offer. We cannot simply lament the waste of valuable materials in garbage without considering that the cost of sorting and transforming "rottenness" into "magic" might outweigh the benefits.

Consider concentrating two thousand tons of garbage in one place. The transportation costs alone would be considerable. Furthermore, if sorted and selected manually, each person could handle, at most, half a ton per day. Two thousand tons would require four thousand people. If each person is paid 2,000 yuan per day (which seems quite meager), then it would cost 8 million yuan per day, and this does not include the cost of packaging and transportation. With 50% of the garbage being coal ash and dust, and 20% being melon rinds and fruit peels, it is unlikely that one could "produce" several million yuan per day. Moreover, Shanghai's garbage has already been sorted once or twice by small beggars while still in the bins, and anything that can be turned into money has already been transformed into "magic," so there is no need to wait until it is concentrated to be discovered.

In these years of soaring prices and scarce resources, "magical" things in garbage are likely rare. And once large-scale sorting begins, unless it is done ten kilometers away from Shanghai, it will inevitably lead to a stench and a swarm of flies. While DDT can kill insects, the expenses will likely increase. (Wang Zhaopei)

### Reviving Guangdong's Sericulture Industry

— He Zhiduan

I. Introduction

Agriculture is the main cornerstone of the province's economy. Among agricultural investments, the capital turnover of the sericulture industry is the fastest. Among agricultural products of the same unit weight, the price of raw silk is the highest. During the peak period of the sericulture industry, over three million people, accounting for more than one-tenth of the province's population, relied on it for their livelihood. Although the province exports many special products, their total economic value is still less than the income from raw silk exports during their peak. Most of the time, there is an import surplus, which relies on raw silk exports to make up the difference. In total, from 1912 to 1932, the province exported 1,052,000 bales of raw silk, averaging about 50,070 bales per year, with each bale weighing 80 catties net. 1922 saw 66,900 bales, the highest record. 1931 saw 34,320 bales, the lowest record. From 1933 to the start of the War of Resistance, annual exports were only about 20,000 bales, and the price dropped sharply, becoming worse and worse! After the main silk-producing areas fell to the enemy, the Japanese invaders exhausted their brutal control and plundering. They also established the "East Asia Flat Cocoon Company" and flat cocoon factories in Shunde, forcing silkworm farmers to produce flat cocoons. The finished products were controlled and purchased by the company for the manufacturing of military supplies. Many local silkworm farmers and silk factories changed their professions to growing sugarcane and producing sugar. The province's sericulture industry has become increasingly depressed. "Shunde as Guangdong's bank" has become a historical cliché!

II. Raising Reconstruction Funds

1. Sources of funding for publicly run sericulture organizations:

A. From the agricultural and forestry authorities themselves: Each department of agriculture and forestry is important, but there are varying degrees of benefit to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Therefore, the implementation of agricultural and forestry construction work should also be prioritized. The funding for less important agricultural and forestry departments can be reduced to the minimum to meet the maximum funding needs of more important agricultural and forestry departments. Sericulture is an important agricultural and forestry sector in this province, and the budget allocated for its construction should be larger. Otherwise, agricultural and forestry construction will be scattered and superficial, difficult to provide practical benefit.

B. From the central authorities: The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Ministry of Economic Affairs have established the China Sericulture Company, demonstrating the authorities' determination to revive the sericulture industry. However, the company's focus seems to be in the Central China region, and it may not be able to reach this province. Therefore, it seems necessary to allocate additional funds to subsidize the development of the sericulture industry in this province.

C. From the Guangdong branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (RRA): Director Ling Daoyang is an agricultural expert, and Mr. Liao Chongzhen, who holds important responsibilities in the administration, is the former director of the Sericulture Bureau of this province. The urgent need to rescue the sericulture industry in this province is self-evident! However, it should be discussed that the funds for rescuing the sericulture industry should be handed over to the agricultural and forestry authorities for unified management and utilization, which can save manpower and financial resources, improve work efficiency, and avoid redundant overlap.

D. From the Bureau of Requisitioned Enemy Assets: Enemy and puppet assets are scattered throughout the province and are a huge source of wealth. The authorities must have a comprehensive plan for their utilization. It is appropriate to take them from traitors and use them for recovery and national reconstruction. What do you think, wise gentlemen?

2. Sources of capital for privately run sericulture enterprises:

A. Foreign investment: Foreign countries find it difficult to develop the sericulture industry due to excessively high wages. For example, the United States is a silk-consuming country, and its geography and climate are quite suitable for planting mulberry trees and raising silkworms. However, it is limited by high wages and cannot develop. Although many people in that country advocate for the sericulture industry and have proposed solutions such as obtaining cheap labor from Mexico, it would be easier to transfer capital and invest in this province, where the sericulture industry already has some foundation and a large supply of low-wage labor.

B. Overseas Chinese investment: The prosperity of this province relies heavily on remittances from overseas Chinese. However, recently, overseas Chinese have been subject to strict remittance restrictions in foreign countries. Therefore, the return of large amounts of capital to the country still depends on the efforts of our diplomatic authorities.

C. Investment from the Guangdong Industrial Company: During the war, the investment area of the Guangdong Industrial Company was limited to the remote area of northern Guangdong. The types of enterprises invested in were mostly farms. At that time, due to environmental limitations, it was unable to consider operating the sericulture industry. Now that the homeland has been recovered, silk should account for a large proportion of the province's exports. Therefore, investing in the sericulture industry is very beneficial. If there is a shortage of capital and it is not possible to establish a larger-scale sericulture enterprise, then ways can be found to issue company shares as a method of raising funds.

D. Bank investment: During the War of Resistance, Guangdong banks invested in agriculture and forestry, such as cattle breeding farms and forest farms, scattered throughout northern Guangdong. In the future, it is believed that farsighted bankers will compete to invest in the sericulture industry, which has a fast capital turnover.

E. Encourage investment from urban floating capital: If urban capital is allowed to float freely, it can easily be transformed into speculative capital that affects people's livelihood. The sericulture industry is a permanent enterprise. Once this industry is promoted, agriculture, industry, and commerce will flourish. No matter how large the floating capital is, if it is properly encouraged, it can be absorbed into this enterprise.

F. Agricultural bank loans: Establish branches of the agricultural bank in towns and cities with convenient transportation in the original and expanded sericulture areas to provide loans to silkworm farmers. However, the loan procedures and operating regulations must be simple and clear, and prevent private speculation and fraud. Most of the silkworm farmers who need assistance are poor and ignorant. Therefore, agricultural and forestry guidance personnel must cooperate in advance to promote the information so that everyone knows. Thorough measures must be taken to benefit poor silkworm farmers. Otherwise, this type of loan is often used by landlords and local tyrants and does not benefit poor farmers.

To revive the sericulture industry, a large amount of financial resources is necessary, but the most important thing is the issue of how to use the financial resources. In other words, how to achieve the greatest effect with the least amount of capital to achieve the best economic results. I believe that there are three principles of operation: (1) Concentrated use, in two points: one, concentration of institutions. All financial resources used for reviving sericulture must be concentrated in a small number of institutions for unified distribution; second, concentration of departments. The agricultural and forestry construction departments are very broad and the financial resources are limited. Instead of distributing the financial resources equally among the construction of each department, it is better to focus on a few more important departments and seek to revive and develop them first. (2) Rapid use. Currently, prices are soaring and increasing. After obtaining funds, they must be used immediately to reduce the impact of price increases. (3) Material resource utilization. We can use ancestral halls and temples in the countryside for sericulture sites; we can use wind caves and mountain caves for various cold storage; we can use the rapid water power of the East River and North River as the original power of silk-making machinery; we can try to obtain machinery, instruments, and books for testing and research from Japan's compensation for our losses.

III. Establishing More Sericulture Sites

Looking back, during the war, the only organization responsible for improving the province's sericulture industry was the Sericulture Section of the Agricultural and Forestry Bureau, with three external sites: (1) Lechang Mulberry and Silkworm Improvement Site, (2) Xijiang Mulberry and Silkworm Improvement Site, (3) Tiancan Test Site. After the restoration and up to the present, in addition to the original sites, the most important sites to be added are nurseries and silkworm seed farms. These two types of sites should be established according to the geographical distribution of the sericulture industry and be responsible for reproduction and promotion.

(1) Nursery: During the war, mulberry farmers in various regions switched to planting miscellaneous grains and sugarcane. Currently, more sensitive and prescient farmers already know how to start restoring their sericulture business, but many suffer from a lack of mulberry seedlings. Therefore, to restore and expand the area of mulberry fields, it is necessary to breed a large number of seedlings first. There are two types of mulberry seedlings in this province: Heshan variety and Datong variety. The latter is not drought-resistant and is suitable for low-lying, humid land. The former is drought-resistant and is suitable for dry farming in high-lying areas. For the sake of quickly achieving success, it may be expedient to choose varieties with less variation for mass propagation. As for other good varieties, such as Shi Ping Early-bearing, Jiuwenlong, Shizimonji, and Shufan, they can be propagated and promoted only after trial experiments of soil suitability and adaptability are carried out in the next step.

(2) Seed-producing farm: Currently, due to the reduced area of mulberry fields and the lack of mulberry leaves, it is difficult to raise silkworms on a large scale. However, good varieties can be selected and produced in areas with more abundant mulberry quantities, and promoted on a large scale. Silkworm seeds in this province are mostly multi-voltine, resistant to high temperatures and high humidity, have a short growth period, and the silk has a particularly strong luster. However, the breeds are impure, the quality is weak and prone to disease, the cocoons are thin and small, there is more floss silk, and reeling is more difficult. The silkworm seeds in Taizhou Province are used for the round month large production, and each silkworm seed paper (500 moths) yields about 150-200 catties of fresh cocoons. In Jiangsu and Zhejiang, each silkworm seed paper (28 moths) can yield 30 catties of fresh cocoons. The cocoon yield of silkworm seeds in this province is less than half of that in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Therefore, this province urgently needs unified silkworm seeds that are high-yielding, have good silk quality, and are disease-free. The former Sericulture Bureau promoted the Bijiao variety, and the Xijiang Mulberry and Silkworm Improvement Site had the No. 258 variety. The No. 1 seed-producing farm was located in Rongqi, Shunde, and the No. 2 silkworm seed farm was located in Jiujiang, Nanhai. Now they have been greatly damaged. The Xijiang Mulberry and Silkworm Improvement Site has only the cold storage equipment remaining. (To be continued)

### An Overview of Industrial and Commercial Management

— Xu Baiyi

3. Good Friendship in All Aspects: There should be close contact with merchants who frequently do business. That way, when they have any news or suitable raw materials, they will let you know. Many people think that buying other people's goods is a superior position, and they must ensure that others do not get any profit, or get only a very small profit, to be satisfied. In fact, they damage each other's friendship because of this. When there is important news or suitable goods, others will not tell them, so it is easy to miss good opportunities.

4. Accurate Records: There should be accurate records of the various raw materials needed, their sources, and the required quantities. With these records, you can have very practical reference. In particular, there should be statistics on the amount of raw materials needed, so you can know the annual consumption. At the same time, there should also be accurate records of market price fluctuations so that you can refer to the past and look to the future.

When carrying out purchasing work, prices should be quoted by several parties and samples should be submitted for review. There is a Chinese saying, "Compare prices with three companies and you won't suffer a loss." It means that the price must be compared. The usual situation is to inquire about prices. If it is necessary to keep secrets, then the bidding method should be used. Several merchants who are willing to supply the goods should estimate the price, seal it tightly, and send it to the company. A date is set, and it is opened in public (called "opening bids"). Whoever offers the lowest price is awarded the contract or supplies the required raw materials (called "winning the bid").

### Imitation and Creation in Traditional Chinese Painting

— Ying Yeping

Starting with Shi Tao's Treatise on Painting

"If you do not learn the ancient methods, you cannot establish your own; if you do not transform the ancient methods, you will never have your own. This is what is meant by the Shi Tao family style." These are a few lines from my colophon to Shi Tao's painting album several years ago, which I now use as the opening of this article. It can also be said to be the key to a painter's success.

Shi Tao was the most creative painter in the history of Chinese painting. In his painting precepts, we can cite several points that represent his thoughts. In the third chapter of his "Hua Yu Lu" (Painting Discourses), titled "Change," he says: "The ultimate man has no method; not that he has no method, but that having no method is the ultimate method… People say, 'So-and-so's texturing technique can be relied upon,' or 'Without resembling so-and-so's landscapes, one cannot be passed down for long,' or 'So-and-so's purity can establish one's character,' or 'Without resembling so-and-so's meticulousness, one is not enough to please people.' This is me being employed by so-and-so's family, not so-and-so's family being used by me. Even if I force myself to resemble so-and-so's family, I am only eating their leftovers. What is left for me?" In the seventh chapter, "Yin Yun" (Primordial Chaos), he says: "...When painting mountains, make them spirited; when painting water, make it dynamic; when painting forests, make them vibrant; when painting people, make them refined. Understand the harmony of brush and ink, comprehend the distinctions of yin and yang, create a new world from chaos, transmit it to future generations, and establish your own school. All of this is achieved through wisdom. Do not carve mechanically, do not become rigid and stale, do not sink into the mud, do not be entangled, do not be disjointed, do not be without reason. Establish your spirit in the sea of ink, determine life from the tip of your brush, exchange the rough form on the small canvas, and release light from the chaos. Even if the brush is not like a brush, the ink is not like ink, and the painting is not like a painting, I am still present." In the eighth chapter, "Mountains and Rivers," he says: "Measure the forms and shapes of mountains and rivers, gauge the vastness of the land, examine the density of peaks and ranges, and discern the obscurity of mist and clouds. Occupy a thousand miles upright, cast a sidelong glance at ten thousand layers, and unify them under the authority of Heaven and the balance of Earth. Heaven has this authority, capable of transforming the essence of mountains and rivers; Earth has this balance, capable of moving the vital energy of mountains and rivers; I have this single stroke, capable of penetrating the forms and spirits of mountains and rivers. This is why I have not broken away from mountains and rivers for fifty years, nor have I treated them as dregs, causing them to be selfish; mountains and rivers have made me speak on their behalf. Did mountains and rivers break away from me, or did I break away from mountains and rivers? Exhaustively search for strange peaks to make drafts, and mountains and rivers and I meet in spirit and transform in trace. Therefore, it ultimately returns to Great Purification." In the fourth chapter, "Reverence and Acceptance," he says: "A single stroke contains all things within it; painting receives ink, ink receives brush, brush receives wrist, and wrist receives heart, like the creation of Heaven and the formation of Earth. This is why it is received." In Shi Tao's painting inscriptions, there are words like these: "If one sees this path clearly, then one must release the brush and sweep directly, surveying thousands of peaks and ten thousand valleys in a single glance. It looks like startling lightning and rushing clouds, rising in masses. Is it Jing Guan? Is it Dong Ju? Is it Ni Huang? Is it Shen Zhao? Who can give it a name? I have often seen various famous artists who, at every turn, say they imitate so-and-so's style or follow so-and-so's school. Writing and painting are born of Heaven, and each person is in charge of the affairs of their own generation."

From the above arguments, it can be seen how Shi Tao was filled with a spirit of originality. Imitation and following are what Shi Tao most rejected. He was an extremely intelligent person, so he exaggerated his own creative theories and concealed the facts of imitation. He did not admit that his paintings were imitated from somewhere or that his brushwork was learned from somewhere. Only in this way could he show his genius and creativity. In fact, Shi Tao was not a born painter. His achievements were undoubtedly learned from the ancients. When we study his paintings, we should understand his origins and not be deceived and blinded by his theories without rational analysis and factual basis. Moreover, in his theories, it is not that he absolutely does not accept the legacy of the ancients. Now let me first find out his origins. I cannot speak blindly; I must also cite evidence. Only in this way can we avoid blindly following and find a real way out for those who study painting. His paintings are learned from Huang He Shan Qiao (i.e., Wang Shuming), and his brushwork is obtained from Shan Qiao in every stroke.

The winter before last, I saw Huang He Shan Qiao's "Secluded Residence in the Forest" at Wang Jiqian's house. The techniques include ox-hair and bean-like texture strokes, and moss dots have flying mosses in the face. Everything that Shi Tao boasted as creation and thought was the secret of Heaven and Earth's creation can be found in this painting. There are also many places where Shi Tao imitated Shan Qiao's "Hui Lu's Small Hermitage" and "Tea Brewing Picture". From this, it can be said that a painter cannot succeed without going through the stage of imitation. Shi Tao is the painter who is most able to imitate the ancients.

For example, when making a light bulb, if you do not understand the principle of how the initially invented five-candlepower bulb is constructed, it is practically impossible to improve it and make a one-hundred-candlepower bulb. Therefore, to improve, you must first understand the principles of past successes, and then you can have greater success. The imitation of painting is also the same: one must thoroughly understand the essence of the ancient masters. It is not enough to just look at collotype editions, copy some fake copies, and obtain their superficial resemblance. To give another shallow analogy:

A jar of mud-sealed wine, with a red paper label written in black characters, loudly proclaims "Vintage Hua Diao," followed by a large set of advertisements describing its color, aroma, and taste. But when the jar is opened, it is just a pool of clear water, leaving the saliva-dripping drinkers to only stare at the label in a daze. Can everyone admit that this is a jar of fine wine?

Therefore, imitation is not an easy task, and creation is even more difficult. Wang Lutai has the following saying about imitation: "Wen Zhengming, Shen Zhou, Tang Yin, Qiu Ying, and Dong Qichang, although they each use different brushstrokes, they all deliberately learn from the ancients, and they are actually breathing through the same nostrils. In recent times, the way of painting has been usurped, the ancient methods have gradually disappeared, and many people create their own new ideas. False seeds are spread, and they become evil and strange, beyond salvation." Wen Zhengming, Shen Zhou, Tang Yin, Qiu Ying, and Dong Qichang, who were cited by Lutai, are all great writers representing their times. Can we say that they have no creative ability? However, their creations all evolved from imitating the ancients. Therefore, the ancients said: "To study without learning from the ancients is like walking in the night without a fire." This is not wrong.

My conclusion is that imitation is the foundation of learning, and creation is the expression of success. Imitation is accepting the ancient masters' methods of using brush, ink, color, composition... It is not copying the ancient masters' compositions. This acceptance must be accepted through the author's consciousness and experience. I think this kind of "imitation" will not lead to the result of submerging one's personality and being confined by the ancients.

### On European Painting in the Last Hundred Years

— Wen Zhaotong

Independent European painting began with Giotto in Italy in the early 13th century. Generally speaking, he was a painter who was a precursor to the Renaissance.

Until recently, the history of European painting has only been over five hundred years. Compared with our Chinese painting, their development is naturally far more advanced than ours.

Why is European painting so developed, especially in the last hundred years? It is truly a meteoric rise. When we look at it, we cannot help but envy it. We often feel inferior or blame the artists for not working hard enough. This is actually unnecessary.

The development of painting is by no means a matter of painting and its artists alone. It should be recognized as a social matter. If we look at the development of European painting in the last hundred years, we can be even more convinced that this view is reasonable. It is by no means the result of painting being isolated from politics or religion. It should be recognized that the relationship between politics or religion and art has its inevitability.

The Industrial Revolution in England in 1764 was the beginning of changing the method of social production in Europe. Under this method of production, a new productive force and productive relations were formed. In painting, classicism was merely a dying echo of feudal politics. It was finally unable to resist the high tide of the bourgeois revolution. David followed the Napoleonic regime and disappeared. The so-called academic school was just the aftermath of classicism, and it was only natural that it was rejected.

Delacroix, who painted masterpieces such as "1830" and "Dante's Boat," was a painter full of revolutionary enthusiasm. Therefore, he enjoyed the reputation of a master of Romanticism. His achievements reflected the success of the French Revolution.

Millet and Courbet are painters who are called Realists. On the one hand, they wanted to escape reality, and on the other hand, they wanted to expose reality. This is the inevitable dilemma of artists in bourgeois society. This era also produced many landscape painters, and many people praised them because they purified painting. In fact, this is a wrong view.

Mature capitalist society will inevitably make science highly developed. The paintings of Impressionism and Neo-Impressionism, which praised sunlight and valued color, cannot be regarded as artists working for art's sake. It is an art that reflects the development of science.

From around the First European War to the Second World War, capitalism was highly developed, fully expressing the social characteristics of free competition and winning by surprise. Therefore, Post-Impressionism, Fauvism, Cubism, Futurism, Surrealism... all kinds of paintings emerged. Everyone thinks that this is the development of pure painting because these arts do not talk about content, but only seek expression. We Chinese are still loudly shouting "The glory of Eastern art!" because European painters are also paying attention to lines and studying brushwork, clearly learning Eastern art, especially Chinese painting. In fact, if you close your eyes and think about it, Chinese painting was produced in a feudal society of agricultural production. The European society of the 20th century is not equal to Chinese society. How can the art of painting, as the superstructure of society, be the same? On the surface, it is glory, but what is the essence?

Now is the atomic age, and European painting will inevitably have a new development.

Ru Zhu A (1841-1919) is a French Impressionist master whose paintings are brightly colored, rich, and gently brushed. (Collected by Huang Hanqiu)

### Two Modern Sculptors - Sculpting Studio Notes

— Liu Shi

Rodin (A. Rodin 1840-1917), the revolutionary pioneer of modern sculpture, and Cézanne (Paul Cezanne 1839-1906) in the painting world, can be called the two great contributors to the modern art revolution. Moreover, he established the independent status of sculpture as "pure appreciative art."

Rodin was born in Paris, with a strong will and enthusiasm. His works were greatly influenced by Impressionism and had a particularly realistic style. He was good at capturing people's momentary emotions and dynamics. Therefore, his works are extremely vivid. "The Kiss," "The Thinker," "The Burghers of Calais," "Balzac," and "The Bronze Age" are all representative masterpieces of his life.

Nude Sculptor Mayol

Although Maillol (A. Maillol 1861) was Rodin's junior, his status and achievements in the modern French art world are not weaker than Rodin's. He deserves to be praised as a master of modern sculpture. He is still alive. His works have the good traditions of classicism. All the beautiful advantages and emotions of Greek, Egyptian, and even Eastern art are extracted by him and expressed in his own works with new techniques and new postures, such as "Harmonie," "Statuetteen Bois," "Pomone," etc. These are all carefully crafted masterpieces that are sufficient to represent him. Maillol followed the Impressionist nude painter Renoir (Auguste Renoir 1841-1919) in his youth and was greatly influenced by him. His paintings and sketches are in the style of Bi Shaw Lei. In 1909, he created a portrait for Renoir, which Renoir greatly appreciated and exclaimed, "This is simply my self-portrait!" This proves the style of Maillol and Renoir. They both paint and sculpt, and are both modern nude works, which can be called double heroes.

After the victory, more Western books and magazines are arriving in Shanghai, but most of them are popular books and publications. There are not many about art. It is reported that some art lovers are jointly ordering art books and publications directly for reference and to understand the development of foreign art in recent years.

### The Arrangement Method of Landscape Painting (Continued from the manuscript of July 29)

— Cheng Mingshi

In addition to the "person-shaped arrangement method," there are also the principles of vertical and horizontal, and emptiness and fullness. What is meant by vertical and horizontal? It is the interspersion of vertical scenery and horizontal scenery. Originally, a painting should have towering places and also horizontal places in order to show changes and levels. For example, trees are towering, and the slopes and rocks below should be spread horizontally; the main peak is towering, and the distant mountains should be arranged horizontally. Also, the main part of a painting is towering, and the supporting part should be arranged horizontally; the main part is horizontal, and the supporting part should be straight and towering. The scenery of ancient paintings is so easy to see as far away because this principle is applied.

What is meant by emptiness and fullness? Fullness is the part with brush and ink, and emptiness is the blank part. A painting must have emptiness and fullness, or more fullness and less emptiness, or more emptiness and less fullness. It should be considered at any time to ensure stability. Recent commentators on painting believe that it is better to have more emptiness and less fullness than more fullness and less emptiness, but this is not entirely true. Ancient paintings often have thousands of mountains and trees, filling the paper, but they do not necessarily look not ethereal; while recent paintings, although they have only a hill and a gully, with a full paper of blank space, sometimes feel solid; this is because the ancients arranged them properly, while recent people are not good at composition. For example, in the midst of towering mountains and ridges, revealing a section of clouds and smoke in the most suitable place feels infinitely ethereal, while a full paper of blank space turns out to have no ethereal interest. The ancients said, "The ancients' positions are tight but the brush and ink are loose, and the modern people's positions are relaxed but the brush and ink are solid," these two sentences are also very reasonable.

Landscape painting is mainly based on trees and rocks (rocks include mountains). A painting must have main trees and main mountains: in the whole picture, among several clusters of trees, there must be a cluster of main trees (often the closest cluster), and among several layers of mountains, there must be a layer of main mountains; in one layer, among several trees, there must be a main tree (often the frontmost one), and among several mountains, there must be a main mountain. The main trees and main mountains should be described with special effort. Once the main trees and main mountains are good, the whole picture will gain momentum. (The main trees and main mountains should be in a relatively central position, not too biased to one side.)

Having trees and mountains is the formal style of landscape painting; having trees without mountains, or having mountains without trees, is the variant style of landscape painting. Variant styles can only be done occasionally, and doing too much will lack interest. The composition of the variant style should be peculiar, so that people will not feel monotonous when they look at it. The most important thing is to change it a little.

Although the three principles of unity, evenness, and change must be applied everywhere in the painting, special attention should be paid to the layout aspect. The reason why a painting must have main trees and main mountains is to apply the principle of unity, using the main trees and main mountains to command and connect everything, so that the viewer's attention is concentrated. The layout of a painting should not be too biased to one side, and it must be symmetrical everywhere, which is applying the principle of evenness. The layout of a group of paintings should not be too symmetrical everywhere. It must be either biased to the left, or biased to the right, or biased to the top, or biased to the bottom, sparse where there should be density, dense where there should be sparseness, rising and falling, one real and one empty. This is applying the principle of change. And in the whole picture, all parts must echo each other, and the energy should not be interrupted, which is also the most important point. (This is also the principle of unity.)

Ordinary landscape paintings must leave "heaven and earth heads" up and down (heaven and earth heads are the blank spaces above and below). Generally, "heaven and earth heads" should be about one-fourth or one-fifth of the painting, not too much or too little; "earth head" should be about one-third of "heaven head," but it is not fixed, and should be considered at any time. Some paintings do not reveal the "heaven head" or do not reveal the "earth head," and some do not reveal the "heaven and earth heads." This is also a kind of variant style. Generally, high and distant paintings often do not reveal the "heaven head" to show their height; deep and distant paintings often do not reveal the "earth head" to show their depth (some reveal a section of clouds above, and some reveal a section of clouds below, which is even more profound); as for flat and distant paintings, they leave more "heaven and earth heads" to show the openness. Therefore, the layout of flat and distant paintings is the most common compositional method in landscape painting.

### Reading the Paintings of the Three Wangs at Mei Jing Shu Wu

— Jin Qijing

On a long summer evening, I went to Songshan Road to visit the Mei Jing Shu Wu owner. There are studios of two contemporary first-class painters on Songshan Road, one is Songshan Caotang, and the other is Mei Jing Yi Lu.

The owner of Mei Jing Hua Wu is rich in collection. He has hundreds of famous paintings from past dynasties, and he is proficient in identification. Therefore, people who collect ancient paintings must read his inscriptions and identifications. He has the first masterpiece in the world, the "Fuchun Mountain Dwelling" by Huang Zijiu of the Yuan Dynasty. Although it is only a corner of the ruins, its great achievements have been passed down and it is worth being called a national treasure.

The owner has four three-foot-sized landscape paintings of the Four Wangs, all of which are the same size. Although the ages of these four landscape paintings are different, the paper is clean and flawless, and there is no difference at all. Among them, the two paintings by Shi Gu and Lu Tai are hung on the walls next to the owner's bed, which is truly "lying down and traveling" in the landscape! Shi Gu is in ink and wash, imitating Huang He Shan Qiao's brushwork, but it is smooth and easy, which is different from Shi Gu's other styles. Especially his brushwork is delicate and elegant, which is simply indistinguishable from Nantian's landscape! Some people say that Nantian and Shi Gu were friendly, and Nantian was unwilling to be in second place, so he changed to learning flowers and plants to avoid Shi Gu, but Nantian's landscape has a unique secluded and delicate style, and it is not necessarily "second place"! This Shi Gu landscape is painted very richly, but the richness of the mountains has emptiness in it. Most painters only want to draw a few strokes casually to boast of emptiness. If you have seen this Shi Gu landscape, you will inevitably have new discoveries.

Lu Tai is originally good at light ochre. This one uses Yunlin's brushwork and writes a light ochre landscape in Yifeng's brushwork. Lu Tai once criticized Shi Gu's landscape for being "too ripe" and self-declared it as "not raw and not ripe". In this light ochre landscape, it can prove that his words are not too exaggerated. The brushwork is strong and powerful, and it seems to be different from the Shi Gu landscape on the right. As for the brushing of color, it is even more skillful. The owner of Mei Jing Shu Wu and I pointed to it with a smile and said: Lu Tai's use of color is really indescribably subtle!

After seeing Shi Gu and Lu Tai, I unfolded Yan Ke's landscape. It is also in ink and wash, and it also uses Yunlin's artistic conception, and the brushwork is not purely Yunlin. At the top is an inscription by Zhao Xiangguang. The owner of the Shu Wu once said that this Yan Ke is a work of his prime at the age of forty-one. Zhao Xiangguang was already an old man of nearly eighty at that time, and the inscription is full of flattering and encouraging words. On this point, the opinion of the owner of the Shu Wu is completely the same as mine. He said: Yan Ke is clearly a painter of the Ming Dynasty, but the historians forcibly pulled him to be a painter of the Qing Dynasty in order to put together the name of the "Four Wangs"! It seems that the modern Xiao Wu Lao is also an old senior painter over eighty years old, who has enjoyed great fame for fifty or sixty years! Will the historians in the future consider him a painter of the Qing Dynasty? Or a painter of the Republic of China?

Finally, I wanted to see Lianzhou's painting, but the owner of the Shu Wu said: I don't know where it is hidden, and I can't find it for a while! It can be seen that there are really too many famous paintings in the collection of Mei Jing Hua Wu. I can only read the Three Wangs and cannot make up the Four Wangs.

### Miss Shanghai

— Shao Fu

The election of Miss Shanghai has encountered many setbacks. It was once said that Bai Yang, Zhou Xuan, Hu Feng, Qin Yi, and others from the film star group would participate. However, Bai Yang is currently filming in Beiping and does not plan to come to Shanghai. Zhou Xuan recently declined to participate, and Hu Feng has also formally denied it. It is still unknown whether Qin Yi will agree, which is truly worrying and disappointing for this grand event.

Ultimately, there are still exciting things. It is said that a student from the Minli Girls' Middle School, Gao Qingyi, voluntarily signed up with the North Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association fundraising meeting to participate in the election. Miss Gao said that her participation in the election is based on the spirit of human mutual assistance and the ancient teaching of disaster relief and neighborly compassion. Her motivation is entirely for disaster relief and she does not hope to be elected. This demeanor of a seventeen-year-old high school student is worthy of admiration. Moreover, the 3.5 million displaced compatriots in North Jiangsu will sincerely bless Miss Gao, who is leading the way with her benevolent and chivalrous spirit.

Regarding the election of Miss Shanghai, I hope that whether those in charge or other parties do not harbor a playful attitude. Everyone's attitude should be serious and earnest. To be honest, if the organizers treat it as a "gimmick" and do not handle it as a very serious matter, then the atmosphere among the onlookers will definitely be frivolous, and participants will naturally fear attracting gossip and be unwilling to show their faces. In today's bad social atmosphere, "looking at everything from the worst perspective" is the most popular. Lack of confidence, distrust of others, and unwillingness to be kind to others are truly the fatal wounds of our country. We must correct this phenomenon by being serious in everything, doing one thing like one thing, with a serious attitude, and with everything open and honest.

I don't know the reason why these few film stars in the Miss Shanghai election group are shrinking back, but I believe it must be related to the above situation. In fact, this year truly requires people with the courage to be fools. If we are determined to relieve the North Jiangsu refugees, what is there to worry about? Don't take your own identity too seriously. Society is not blind, and its evaluation of someone is very fair. Therefore, for the sake of this righteous cause, it is a pity that these few ladies in the film star group could not participate! Miss Gao Qingyi is even more worthy of our support.

### Talking About Freaks

— Zhong Qi

Chinese people have always regarded giving birth to multiple children as an auspicious thing, a symbol of wealth. If a woman gives birth to triplets or quadruplets, then it is considered a great joyous event and spread as news. Conversely, if a freak is born, needless to say, it is considered an ominous omen. The family or clan members will definitely carry out various cruel acts of killing such as burying or drowning, and the mother has no right to protect the child, and can only grieve in secret.

In fact, according to scientific principles, the above concepts are completely wrong. Now I will give a relatively simple explanation of the relationship between multiple births and freaks.

According to the research results of scientist Grollo Liex, the chance of multiple births is: approximately one out of eighty-five mothers may produce twins; the ratio of triplets is seven thousand to one; quadruplets are about six hundred seventy-five thousand to one; of course, the chance of quintuplets is even less.

As for the reasons for multiple births, there are two main possibilities: the first is that there are two eggs in the ovary that develop simultaneously, each fertilized to produce two individuals. These twins may be of the same sex or of different sexes. The second is that a fertilized egg is stimulated and undergoes equal division, each developing into an individual. Because these twins are divided from one body, their sex, appearance, and temperament are often completely identical. Sometimes, even their parents cannot tell them apart. For example, the twin brothers who starred in the movie "The Beggar Emperor" in Hollywood a few years ago cannot be distinguished by the average audience.

Twins like the above may not have completely separated in the early stages of embryonic development, and later evolve into various freaks with one head and two bodies, or two heads and one body. Another situation is that the temperature, nutrients, air, etc. in the mother's body are abnormal, and the fertilized egg is locally obstructed, which may produce freaks missing certain limbs.

For example, embryologist Roux has done such experiments: he used a red-hot needle to kill one of the not-yet-completely-separated fertilized eggs. As a result, the grown individual was incomplete. Another example is that German biologist Spemann wrapped the embryos of salamanders with young children's hair, and local development was hindered. As a result, freaks such as two heads or two tails also occurred.

Therefore, freaks are not like those superstitious explanations. There is no need to treat them as terribly as poisonous snakes, and even less to ridicule and despise the pregnant woman, so as to avoid various tragedies!

### Misleading the Youth

— Li Jinxiang

Undeniably, education is sacred, but sacredness cannot be eaten or worn. Those who teach and spend their youth covered in chalk dust, what are they doing it for? Cultivating talents for the country, for the sacredness of education? Or for a living? The answers vary from person to person.

In today's education field, teachers receive a meager salary every month that keeps them from starving to death, and it's the same monotonous routine, month after month. The semester ends, summer vacation begins... They themselves can't quite figure out the transition between winter and summer, the passage of days and months. They vaguely remember that many students who were trained by them in the past have now become celebrities, wealthy businessmen, and tycoons in society, but looking back at themselves, they remain the same, except that there are a few more holes in their coarse cloth shirts!

Education is sacred, but you can't starve to death for the sake of education!

Most of the older teachers have abandoned their books and left the education field to do non-sacred work. The vacant positions are naturally filled by a batch of newly graduated students who have no teaching experience at all. Students' questions often leave them speechless and unable to answer. Therefore, for the sake of face, they resign. As a result, teachers are replaced every three or five days. In a semester, the textbooks haven't been taught halfway through, and the teachers have been replaced more than half a dozen times. This trend is most prevalent in primary and secondary schools.

The downturn in the education sector is one of the reasons for this. Amidst the current rectification of academic standards in various schools, it is hoped that each school will pay special attention to the teachers' academic level and teaching experience.

### Fee Issues at the Municipal Gymnasium

— Song Lian

Yesterday, I accompanied a friend to the Municipal Gymnasium (old Jai Alai Court) on South Shaanxi Road to watch volleyball. I heard Mr. Yao (who specializes in managing the rental of the venue) from the gymnasium say, "Now, because the floor is newly laid and needs to be waxed every day, the cost is very high. In the future, renting the venue will cost 4,000 yuan per hour (daytime), and practicing at night will require an additional 4,000 yuan for electricity (i.e., 8,000 yuan per hour at night). Each team also has to pay a deposit of 20,000 yuan."

I found this very strange. "The Municipal Gymnasium is not a private one, and all expenses should be allocated by the government. In any case, you cannot turn the idea on the teams!"

What I found even stranger was that the fees charged were actually more expensive than the fees for private venues. The YMCA court in Eight Immortals Bridge only charges 1,000 yuan per hour!

I feel that the deposit of 20,000 yuan per team should be paid. When the lease expires, if there are no unexpected events, it should be refunded!

If the Municipal Gymnasium must charge fees, it must be cheaper than private venue fees!

Finally, I hope that the executives of the Municipal Gymnasium will give further consideration to this yet-to-be-announced news.

### American Soldiers

— Yang Mou

Since the victory, American soldiers have often become a topic of discussion. Upon closer examination, opinions are divided. On the one hand, when they drive their lightning-fast jeeps and flaunt jeep girls through the streets, people look on with disapproval. However, their frankness and straightforwardness can also win people's sympathy. The following is what Americans think of American soldiers. The original article is published in the "Military Digest." I am now giving a free translation, so that we can also get a glimpse of their self-criticism.

Deeply Loves His Homeland and Ridicules All Foreign Things: Emotionally agitated, the American soldier is often confident that he himself and his hometown are superior to everything, and ridicules everything foreign.

Frank and Sincere, But Easily Deceived by Merchants: American soldiers are all extremely sincere, frank, and friendly. They believe that everyone is innocent unless proven otherwise. However, because of their integrity and pride, they are often deceived by merchants!

Tolerates Foreign Philosophy, But Easily Angered Behind a Donkey Cart: The United States is a young country, so its national character tends to be optimistic. When seeing the hesitation and indecision of foreigners, although they are confused, they are extremely tolerant. But on a narrow road, when a donkey cart is blocking the way in front, they will shout: "It's their own fault for being so poor, they are still slow, a donkey-drawn culture. We overcome difficulties and have never needed anyone's help"?

Respects Native Girls, But Treats Foreign Women as Prostitutes: The American soldier's friendship is genuine and deep; he respects his native girls sevenfold unless they are proven to be ignoble. However, abroad, he treats all foreign women as prostitutes.

Can Endure Hardships, But Becomes Childish When Homesick: American soldiers can endure any harm they encounter. He doesn't need sympathy. If he loses his right hand, he will use his left hand. But when they suffer from homesickness, they become very childish and clamor to go home.

Respects His Rights, But Accepts Orders from Superiors with Resentment: Although he has undergone four years of military training, his respect for his rights has not diminished. He is a self-respecting person and the greatest hope in the age of democracy. But he does not understand that those who issue orders often bear heavier responsibilities. He envies the lieutenant or captain above him, but at the same time, he hopes for easy promotion.

### Both Crying and Laughing

— Zhi Fen

At a certain middle school on Shanzhong Road, the biology teacher not only does not care when students cheat during exams, but also opens the door for each student when they finish well. The students all laugh, and he says, "What's so strange about that? The teacher is the servant of the students, and the students are the teacher's providers."

There is also a history teacher who, during exams, allows students to flip through their books. Two students could not find the answer, so they said to the teacher, "Teacher, I'm afraid you've made a mistake in this question. Why can't we find it in the book?" The teacher said, "You students are really stupid. How can you not know how to flip through the book!" So the teacher flipped it out for them.

At a certain middle school on Jing'an Temple Road, because the landlord wanted to take back the school building and did not discuss it with the school board, he was about to move the furniture in. Dozens of students voluntarily stayed in the school, so that the classroom was the classroom during the day, but it became a dormitory at night.

At a certain famous university, the first-year Chinese teacher was from Ningbo. This teacher said to the students: "When you study in England, you have to speak English. When you study in France, you have to speak French. Now that you are studying painting with me, Mr. Ningbo, you must all speak Ningbo dialect."

### An Old Man's Heart (Part 1)

— Wang Pingling

Mr. Yuan Xiluo, a senior figure in the Jiangsu education circle, suddenly took pity and sent out a telegram of hunger strike, advising Zhu De and Mao Zedong of Yan'an not to forget that they are both descendants of the Yellow Emperor and to save the three million refugees in northern Jiangsu. Although it may not have any effect, it is at least a call of the times. Although the idea of "humanitarianism" has been recognized as outdated by those who advocate "animalism," one cannot deny that one is a human being who can speak beautiful words, fall in love, stand upright on two feet, use hands to obtain things, or express brilliant opinions, and has significant differences from animals. When a huge number of more than three million people are recorded as refugees who are about to die, Mr. Yuan's occasional call for sympathy is, in any respect, not immoral. A few days ago, the great British writer George Bernard Shaw, who celebrated his ninetieth birthday, once said some honest words: "Now, communism has become the most fashionable cosmetic. Young people can't find a lover if they don't believe in communism. Middle-aged people who have achieved nothing can become famous all over the world by believing in communism. Older people should believe in communism even more, otherwise they will always be backward and never move forward." Now, this Mr. Yuan is unwilling to move forward but is willing to fall behind. He even has the courage to risk 'the world's great disapproval?' and sympathize with the three million refugees in northern Jiangsu who are displaced. It is pitiful that countless helpless children are about to starve to death or die tragically. His ambition is commendable, but his foolishness is inexcusable!

Chinese people are the smartest, most realistic, and most concerned about face. If they see that they have nothing to lose and will become unusable "rotten wood," they will immediately have a flash of inspiration and, like betting on a treasure, pick a path of "both fame and fortune" and go all out in order to easily satisfy their desires. Here, I also recall the words of the old Mr. Ye Chucang. He said: "The signboard of the Revolutionary Party was most lucky and popular in the year of Xinhai. When the Founding Father took office as the interim president in Nanjing, the north and south of the Yangtze River and all parts of the country were full of Revolutionary Party members. If you ask the villagers drinking old tea in the teahouse if they are Revolutionary Party members, they will definitely answer without thinking: 'Yes!' Ask those squatting on the latrine, ask those who analyze characters, tell fortunes, divination, and perform civilized dramas, as well as those who scrub backs, trim feet in bathhouses, and those who shave heads and clean ears in barbershops, and they can all answer fluently: 'Yes! Yes!' As for those gentlemen who call themselves scholar-officials, needless to say. By the second year, when Yuan Shikai wanted to become emperor and massively arrested and killed Revolutionary Party members, when the news of the suffering of Song Jiaoren and Chen Yingshi was written in large letters in the Minquan Bao and Minli Bao, an emergency rumor spread throughout the country. Strangely, those members of the scholar-official class—the so-called intellectuals of society—were so frightened that they burned the Revolutionary Party pamphlets and the Minquan Bao and Minli Bao overnight, burning them until not a single word was left. Even if they were not necessarily Yuan Shikai's loyal subjects, at least no one admitted to being a Revolutionary Party member. And those who performed civilized dramas were still propagating revolution in Shanghai, and those who scrubbed backs and trimmed feet were still talking to the bathers in the bathhouse about how the Revolutionary Party broke through Nanjing City from Yuhuatai and Shencemen, taking pride in thinking that they were also Revolutionary Party members!" The old Mr. Ye was also telling the truth.

Three or Two Words Collection

### Traitor Chu Can't Escape the Death Penalty

— Wuling Ren

In order to promote thrift and eliminate superstition, the municipal government has ordered the police department to ban the Hungry Ghost Festival. The first to be hit, of course, are the monks and Taoists. A large income in the budget will be lost. But assuming that social celebrities launch a large-scale Taoist ceremony to "deliver the deceased generals and martyrs and ask about the compatriots in distress", can it be exempt from the ban?

The Supreme Court rejected Chu Minyi's appeal for retrial, which means that Chu Minyi should still be executed and cannot be reversed. In these many days, Chu Minyi thought he had hope and had been having a "sweet dream." But a bolt from the blue confirmed that he would eventually not escape death. So his short-term "sweet dream" was just like the "sweet dream" he had after collaborating with the enemy until the victory, and it was shattered again.

The loss of the old Public Works Bureau archives caused by the report on the He De案 case made me think of the legend of the "Yu Tang Chun" story; according to friends who love Peking opera, "the files of this case are still well hidden in a certain county in Shanxi Province" and have not been "lost". The indeed, it seems like a person only finds himself in a considerably difficult environment". Indeed, it can be confirmed from a portion of friends returning from the rear that their words are not false.

Non-Shanghainese who have lived in Shanghai for two or three generations then call themselves Shanghainese. In fact, according to the law, it seems that a person from place A can be considered a person from place B as long as they have lived in place B for three years. But many "Shanghainese" look down on newcomers from other places. They often scold them as "country bumpkins," which is simply scolding themselves and their ancestors.
