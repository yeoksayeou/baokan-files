### Comprehensive Committee Holds Meeting, First Article of Draft Constitution Revised Again, Decision on National Capital Issue Postponed

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] The first, second, and seventh of the National Assembly's draft constitution review committees have completed their reviews today. At this point, the work of the first through eighth review committees has concluded. The ninth comprehensive review committee held its first meeting this afternoon. It will continue on the 15th, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM, and from 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] The Comprehensive Review Committee of the Draft Constitution held a meeting at the Central Party Headquarters at 3:00 PM this afternoon. Over 130 people attended. The conveners were Sun Ke, Chen Cheng, Chen Qitian, Xu Qilin, Kong Geng, Bai Yunti, Xi Wangshu, Wang Shijie, and He Hong, among others, totaling nine people. Today, Sun Ke served as the chairman. Initially, someone raised the issue of the Comprehensive Review Committee's powers, questioning whether there had been any changes to its authority over the review results of each group. The chairman explained the committee's powers as follows: (1) Issues involving two or more review committees with interconnected relationships would be studied and resolved by this committee. (2) Unresolved issues debated by various review committees. (3) Significant changes to the principles of the draft constitution. (4) Compiling the results of each review committee and organizing the text before submitting it to the National Assembly for discussion. After discussion, it was decided that the original review results of each group and the review results of the Comprehensive Review Committee could be submitted to the National Assembly simultaneously. Following the items decided at the conveners' meeting on the 13th, discussions began on:

(1) The Issue of the Form of Government: The chairman reported that, during the conveners' meeting, representatives from the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party expressed dissent regarding the First Review Committee's revisions. To respect the opinions of all parties, the Comprehensive Committee further discussed and decided to change it to "The Republic of China is a democratic republic based on the Three Principles of the People." The discussion involved some debate, but it proceeded in an atmosphere of amicable consultation. The Democratic Socialist Party representative argued that "Three Principles of the People" should be placed in the preamble, and this article should be changed to "The Republic of China is a democratic republic." One representative believed that this article was biased towards the Kuomintang, and the words "Three Principles of the People" should not be fixed in the text. Subsequently, another representative stated that the Three Principles of the People are no longer exclusive to the Kuomintang. For example, the Program for Resistance and National Reconstruction and the Program for Peaceful National Reconstruction were participated in by various parties and factions, and it was decided to establish the Three Principles of the People as the foundation for national construction. The original article contained the words "Three Principles of the People" and was also agreed upon by various parties. Finally, representative of the social elites, Fu Sinian, spoke, advocating for the removal of the words "of the people, by the people, for the people" from the results of the First Review Committee. Yu Jiaju and many other representatives of the Youth Party immediately expressed their approval, and it was immediately passed. (2) The Issue of the National Capital was postponed for discussion.

Regarding the Powers of the National Assembly - Submitted to the National Assembly for Reconsideration

(3) A. The issue of the National Assembly was decided by the Eleventh Review Committee to add an article at the beginning of Chapter Three: "The National Assembly is the highest organ representing the people of the Republic of China in exercising political power." At the conveners' meeting, the Democratic Socialist Party raised objections. After consultation, it was changed to "The National Assembly exercises political power on behalf of the national people in accordance with the provisions of this Constitution." Many people felt that the words "highest organ" were inappropriate, and the discussion was very heated. As a result, both opinions were submitted to the National Assembly. B. The Second Review Committee amended Article 26 to "Each county or city and its equivalent areas shall elect one representative. However, for every 300,000 people exceeding 300,000, one additional representative shall be elected. Equivalent areas of counties and cities shall be determined by law. The number of representatives elected from the Mongol banners and Tibet shall be determined by law. The number of representatives elected from overseas Chinese nationals shall be determined by law. The number of representatives elected from professional organizations shall be determined by law. The number of representatives elected from women's organizations shall be determined by law." During the Comprehensive Committee's discussion, someone raised the issue of ethnic minorities, suggesting that special provisions should be made for Xinjiang. The meeting adjourned due to the late hour and was scheduled to continue on the 15th, both morning and afternoon, with the hope of completing the discussion on the 15th so that the National Assembly could be held on the 16th. If this is not possible, the National Assembly may be postponed by one day.

### National Assembly Responsible for Supervising and Promoting the Implementation of the Constitution, Second Review Committee Passes Addition of Article 152

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] The Second Review Committee held its final meeting this morning, chaired by Li Bin. First, Article "149", which had already been passed yesterday, was put up for discussion again. Deng Gongxuan and others spoke, believing that the National Assembly should have the power to interpret the constitution. They advocated adding it to the article and stipulating the number of representatives from the Legislative, Supervisory, and Judicial Yuan participating. The interpretation of the amended and passed constitution was that the National Assembly would mutually elect fifteen people, and the Legislative, Supervisory, and Judicial Yuan would each nominate five people to form a Constitutional Interpretation Committee, with the President of the Judicial Yuan as the chairman. Subsequently, Articles "150" and "151" were heatedly discussed and continued to be amended. Zhu Huiqing and others suggested adding Article 152 after Article "151" and passed the text of the article as "The National Assembly that formulates the Constitution is responsible for supervising and promoting the implementation of the Constitution. The term of office of its representatives shall terminate on the day the National Assembly produced in accordance with this Constitution convenes." This article concerns the term of office of the representatives. Zhu and others repeatedly spoke on it. Finally, Dai Tianqiu and others proposed a temporary motion that the National Assembly that formulates the Constitution should establish a committee to supervise the implementation of constitutional governance during its session, and the specific measures would be determined separately. The meeting adjourned in the afternoon. At this point, the Second Review Committee's review of the chapters on "National Assembly" and "Implementation and Interpretation of the Constitution" was completed.

### Seventh Review Committee Completes Review Work

Four Subgroups Pass Resolutions with Amendments

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] The Seventh Review Committee continued its meeting this morning, chaired by Lou Tongsun, and discussed the resolutions made by the four subgroups. Articles "133" to "137", concerning national defense and foreign affairs, were all passed according to the review results of the first subgroup. Article "138" was passed. Items one and two of Article "139" were passed. The third item was changed to "Land prices, excluding those increased by the application of labor and capital, shall be subject to a land value increment tax, which shall be shared by the people," in order to avoid unclear wording and being mistaken for land confiscation. The fourth item was amended to "The state's allocation and organization of land shall be based on the principle of supporting self-cultivating farmers and those who use the land themselves, and stipulating appropriate operating areas." Regarding the public operation of public utilities in "Article 140", Zhu Jiahua advocated adding postal services, telecommunications, and railways, all to be state-owned. Fu Sinian supplemented by adding the words "aviation". A heated discussion ensued. In the end, the majority believed that public utilities were already included, and Zhu and Fu's proposal was rejected. Zhu and others requested the right to raise it again in the National Assembly. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM in the morning and continued in the afternoon.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] The Seventh Review Committee continued its meeting at 3:00 PM this afternoon. Because many representatives went to see a play, only 84 people attended. Xie Chengping, the chairman, reported that each group had finished their work, but this group was behind and hoped to complete the work on that day. The discussion then proceeded "at full speed". Article "141" was passed without objection. Article "142" was moved to the end. Article "143" of the social security section was passed. Articles "144", "145", "147", and clauses 2, 3, and 4 of Article "146" were, due to the issue of central and local authority, passed according to Xiao Zheng's proposal and transferred to the Comprehensive Review Committee to be merged into the chapter on "Authority of the Central and Local Governments". As proposed by Zhu Jiahua, the first item of Article "146", which was reserved, was amended to "All goods within the territory of the Republic of China shall be allowed to circulate freely. (The following eight words are deleted: 'Unless prohibited by law.')" As for Article "148", the issue of financial institutions sparked debate. Zhao Longwen advocated for state-owned banks to prevent private banks from only knowing how to stir up trouble, engage in speculation for profit, and disrupt the distorted phenomenon of finance. Yu Yinsheng believed that, based on the current measures of state-owned banks, state-owned banks alone would not be enough to solve the problem. Zhao replied that if banks could thoroughly improve their business policies and strategies, state-owned banks would definitely be able to develop stable strength. Li Wenzhai declared that the original motivation for this article was to provide relief to the unemployed during the agricultural off-season and should not shift the focus to financial institutions, striving for the interests of the common people. At this point, Xiao Zheng put forward a compromise, believing that the problems with private banks were indeed significant, but uniformly changing them to state-owned also had practical difficulties. He suggested strengthening the management of private banks and promoting small-scale industrial and commercial loans to resolve the dispute. As a result, the article was amended to "The state should widely establish financial institutions for the common people to provide relief to the unemployed." (Originally "Promote full employment," adding thirteen words below: Financial institutions should be managed by the state in accordance with the law. Article "149" was amended to "The state should assist (adding three words) and protect the development of the economic (deleted three words) undertakings of overseas Chinese nationals." As for the proposals concerning labor and capital and currency that were not passed in the subgroup, it was resolved to transfer them to the Comprehensive Review Committee. The review of the national economy section was thus concluded. After a break, the meeting was chaired by Lai Lian to begin discussing the review results of the third education and culture subgroup. In the first article, the words "democratic spirit" in "Article 143 of the original draft" were amended to "spirit of autonomy." The five articles from two to six were all passed without objection. Article seven sparked a heated discussion on education funding. Some advocated not stipulating the proportion of central education funding reduced in the total budget. Some advocated limiting the proportion of education funding for governments at all levels in the total budget to the total current budget, but in the end, it was still passed according to the original proposal. Article eight, regarding the state's protection of the livelihoods of education, science, and art workers, also sparked debate. Cheng Xiaogang and Xiao Zheng believed that there was already universal protection in the social security section and advocated for the abolition of this article. Ding Zhongying then proposed adding the words "medical care", but in the end, those who maintained the original proposal won by a margin of two votes over those who advocated for its abolition. Article nine was passed without objection. Article ten, regarding rewards or subsidies for education, was also passed after debate. The review of the education and culture section was thus concluded. By this time, it was already 8:00 PM, and after extending the meeting, the review results of the fourth social security subgroup, six articles in total, were discussed and passed without objection. Chairman Lai reported that the work of organizing the text and arranging the article numbers for the review was the responsibility of the conveners. The meeting adjourned at 6:10 PM, and the preliminary review of the entire draft constitution was thus completed.

### Taiwan's Facilities are Complete, Should Request Constitutional Rule be Implemented First, Representatives from Taiwan to the National Assembly Express Reasons to Reporters

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] All eighteen representatives from Taiwan to the National Assembly, including Huang Guoshu, hosted reporters at 3:00 PM this afternoon. Huang, Li Wanjyu, Xie E, and others reported separately on the suggestions they had made to the National Assembly. They planned to request that the province be designated as a constitutional experiment province and that the constitution be implemented first in the province after it is promulgated. The reasons are that the province has completed population surveys and land surveys, and the security guards and roads are complete. People’s education is widespread, so constitutional rule should be implemented first. They also asked the government to clearly protect the national status of Taiwanese people and commend the loyalty of the province to consolidate the maritime frontier.

[French News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] The government military spokesman accused this morning that the CCP army has begun to attack Yulin, but the CCP spokesman denied it, saying that this accusation is only an excuse for the government army's activities in the Yan'an border area.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 14th] The Communist army besieging Zhongyang fired poison gas shells into the city from 11 pm, and the defenders are still resisting in a situation of disparity in strength. The situation has been unclear since the telegram was cut off on the 12th.

### First Review Committee Concludes, Amends and Passes Election Chapter, Adds Articles on Recall, Referendum, and Initiative

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] The First Review Committee discussed "Elections" this morning, chaired by Liu Yaozhang, and discussed what kind of electoral system should be adopted for "Article 128". Xia Erkang of the Youth Party and others advocated for the proportional representation system in large electoral districts. Li Junfu of the Democratic Socialist Party also advocated the same. Ren Zhuoxuan and others from the Kuomintang advocated maintaining the original proposal. In the final vote, only a few people agreed to the amendment, so the original proposal was maintained. The Youth Party declared that it reserved the right to speak at the National Assembly. "Article 129" concerned the age requirements for electors and those eligible to be elected. A few representatives advocated adding provisions to the educational level of the electors, and some advocated changing the age of those eligible to be elected to 25. In the end, the original proposal was passed. "Article 130" concerned open elections. Zhang Shan proposed that fathers, sons, husbands, wives, and brothers should not run for election in the same district. Many opposed it, and the original proposal was maintained. "Articles 131" and "132" were passed smoothly. Finally, Zhang Zhiben requested that articles on recall, initiative, and referendum be added after the election articles so that the table with only one leg can be stabilized with four legs. It was resolved and passed to the Comprehensive Committee. The title of Chapter Twelve was changed to "Elections, Recall, Referendum, Initiative." The meeting ended at approximately 10:00 AM with applause.

### Pan Gongzhan Loves the Draft Constitution Early, Drafting a Constitution is Not About the Articles, But About Being Practical, A Constitutional Government Can Be Formed Within a Year

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] National Assembly representative and Speaker of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Pan Gongzhan, recently published his opinions on the draft constitution. First, he said, "As far as I know, a constitution is the result of a country's revolution, a record of the rights that the general public obtains after the revolution and the obligations they should fulfill. At the same time, it is also a model for the government and the people to abide by together. Therefore, a constitution cannot but contain some ideals, but its ideals must be ones that can be realized in the near future. Otherwise, it is better to focus on practicality so that each chapter and article of the draft constitution is feasible. It is better to have a draft constitution with twenty or thirty plain and easy-to-implement articles than to have a draft constitution with two or three hundred lofty and difficult-to-implement articles. We participate in the work of drafting a constitution, but we only seek to promulgate a few articles that are necessary for the people and the government in the shortest period of time, which is more beneficial than delaying and not making a decision after discussion."

Mr. Pan continued, "The central government of China during the constitutional period must not only strive for democratization on the one hand, but also give it the power to handle affairs as quickly as possible on the other hand, so that it can be expected to be 'omnipotent' in the near future. I hope that the people and the government, in the early days of implementing constitutional governance after the promulgation of the constitution, can consolidate the foundation of democratic politics in China under the rule of law."

Mr. Pan also said that the Fifth-Fifth Draft Constitution and the draft constitution submitted by the National Government this time each have their own characteristics, but the current draft constitution is revised based on the principle of consultation among the various parties, which is easier for all parties to accept. It is hoped that the National Assembly will have better revisions after exchanging opinions among all parties to make it more perfect. Generally, if there are better arrangements for the future organization and powers of the Legislative Yuan and the National Assembly, the relationship between the Legislative Yuan and the Executive Yuan, and the powers of the central and local governments, then this definite constitution can be expected to be feasible.

Mr. Pan believes that during the current National Assembly, the representatives are discussing enthusiastically and reviewing extremely carefully. Although there are occasional disputes that lead to flushed faces or affect order, this is a common occurrence in parliaments of various countries and is not surprising. Mr. Pan also predicts that the Chinese constitutional government will be able to be formed within a year in accordance with the constitution.

### Pingbao Line, Through Traffic on the 20th, Jiaoji Railway Can Be Restored to its Original State Next Spring

[This Newspaper, Zhangjiakou, 14th] The PingSui Railway from Beiping to Chaigoubao, and from Datong to Baotou, have been repaired and opened to traffic. Between Tianzhen and Yanggao, the roadbed was severely damaged by the Communist army, and the bridges were excavated and blown up. The sleepers and rails were burned and destroyed. The repairs took time. After more than a month of efforts by the road bureau staff, they repaired day and night between Zhangyuan and Datong. The tracks were connected at Luowenzao in Yanggao on the 12th. The Ministry of Transportation’s Office in Zhang sent a train from Zhangyuan at 8:00 am on the 13th to conduct a formal test run. The results were very good. According to the person in charge of the road bureau, it is planned to start transporting trains, transport road repair materials and workers from today, and actively prepare to transport passengers.

### Miaofengshan Army was Expelled, The Fierce Battle Near Lugou Bridge is Inaccurate

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 14th] Miaofeng Mountain, a famous scenic spot in western Beiping, has recently been stationed by the county security police regiment, and the Communist army there has been driven back.

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 14th] At 7:00 pm last night, a part of the 31st Brigade of the Communist army was active between Changxindian and Lugou Bridge, but no fighting occurred. It is inaccurate to say that there was a fierce battle near Lugou Bridge. There was also a small contact near Liulihe the night before.

### Youth Party Establishes Party Headquarters in Provinces such as North China, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and Shanxi, Liu Siying Expresses Opinions on the Draft Constitution

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 14th] Liu Siying, Secretary-General of the Youth Party, told reporters on the 14th: (1) The Youth Party has established formal parties and party headquarters in North China, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shanxi and other provinces. The organization of the party headquarters is roughly the same as that of the Kuomintang, and it is divided into provincial party headquarters, municipal party headquarters, and county party headquarters. In addition, the country is divided into several supervision areas. Liu himself is the person in charge of the North China Supervision Area. Zheng Dabu is the chairman of the Ping City Party Headquarters, Liu Jingyuan is the chairman of the Law City Party Headquarters, and Zhu Dewu is the chairman of the Ji Province Party Headquarters. Since this year, the Youth Party has been conducting open activities in various places. Only the Communist Party area has not yet been able to switch to above-ground activities. The Ping City Party Headquarters is now working in Dongsi Dayuan Hutong. Currently, party member registration is being carried out everywhere, and the exact number of party members is unknown. (2) The Youth Party has always advocated the nationalization of the army, so although there are also Youth Party members in the army, our party still allows them to be under the command of the central government. In answering reporters' questions, Liu denied that Liu Wenhui was a Youth Party member and was only sympathetic to the Youth Party. He also said: The January 28th Songhu Anti-Japanese War was launched by the Youth Party, Weng Zhaoyuan was a Youth Party member, and there were also Youth Party volunteers in the Northeast. (3) The Youth Party has no disagreement on participating in the National Assembly. The Youth Party's National Assembly list was handed over to Chairman Chiang by Zeng Qi and Li Huang, two close friends. Li Huang is by no means suffering from political illness.

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 14th] Liu Siying issued his views on the Constitution on the 14th, stating: (1) Today's draft constitution is not the opinion of the Youth Party alone, but since it was passed by the Political Consultative Conference, our party should support it morally. If the National Assembly makes major revisions to the Political Consultative Conference's draft constitution, our party will reserve its opinions and continue to fight. It is very common for a political party to advocate for a cause for ten or twenty years. (2) Candidates for public office must pass an examination, which deprives people of their right to vote and should be abolished. (3) Although the president can have the power of emergency disposition, it is inappropriate to expand this power to financial matters. (4) It is not good for the Legislative Yuan to be a permanent body, because the legislators are elected from various regions, and it already takes a lot of time and money to go to Beijing twice a year for meetings.

### Communist Party Draft Constitution, The Content is Divided into Five Points

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 14th] It is rumored that the Communist Party has drafted a constitution and is preparing to submit it when the "People's Congress" is convened. Recently, local officials announced that the content of the draft constitution was based on the Communist Party's opinions on the draft constitution submitted to the Political Consultative Conference in April. The important points are five: (1) Acknowledge that the chairman is the supreme leader of China and is willing to uphold the Three Principles of the People as the basic principles of national construction. (2) The Kuomintang should not account for more than one-third of the National Assembly representatives, the Communist Party should account for one-third, and other parties and non-party members should account for one-third. (3) Provincial and county heads are elected by the people. (4) Provinces can formulate provincial constitutions without violating the Constitution. (5) Establish a joint command headquarters to command the national army. This joint command headquarters is jointly composed of personnel from various parties. Officials also stated that the Communist Party is preparing to announce it first to confront the National Assembly.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] It is reported that the Communist Party is actively preparing for the People's Congress and is about to formulate a constitution. Someone in Beijing has seen the draft of the constitution.

### Safeguarding the Livelihoods of News Reporters: Constitutional Draft Review Meeting Resolves to Submit for Assembly Discussion

[Central News Agency, this city] Representatives of the National Assembly's news reporter professional group, Bao Mingshu, Chen Kanghe, Tang Qi, Ling Shaozu, and others, in order to ensure that the livelihoods and work of news professionals are legally protected by the state, recently proposed to the National Assembly to amend Article 145 of the constitutional draft, which states, "The state shall protect the livelihoods and working conditions of those engaged in education, science, art, and culture," by adding the words "news" after the word "science." This has been approved by the review meeting and submitted to the assembly for discussion, with the hope of its passage. The reasons stated in the proposal are as follows: News reporters, during the revolutionary war of resistance, sacrificed countless lives, blood, and sweat in order to fulfill their missions, choosing righteousness over personal gain. The stories of Song Yufu and Huang Yuansheng are but a few historical examples. News reports, editorials, and commentaries, once published in black and white, carry unlimited responsibility, sometimes with immediate consequences. During the war of resistance, news reporters ventured into battlefields, braving danger, airplanes, tanks, gunfire, and artillery shells, enduring countless deaths, injuries, and captures. Even in times of peace, news reporters must work day and night, pursuing news targets regardless of distance, time, weather, or personal discomfort. Their sense of responsibility allows no hesitation. News reporters must possess the physical strength to run and endure hunger, and the talent to speak and write, yet they are often met with scorn and ridicule, which is commonplace. They face harsh environments daily, which constantly threaten their lives. Consider how few of the countless young reporters become white-haired veterans of the profession. The hardship of their work and the difficulty of their lives are no less than those of laborers, and the mental exertion they endure surpasses that of any other profession. The state should provide special protection for them, which is only fitting. Therefore, it is proposed to add the word "news" after the word "science" in Article 145 of the constitution. Please vote in favor.

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Cables the National Assembly, Requesting a Decision to Establish the Capital in Nanjing

[Another dispatch] The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday cabled the National Assembly, stating: "According to reports, the issue of the capital in the constitution is subject to various opinions and unresolved debates. This chamber believes that the capital, as the political center, must be closely linked to the economic center. Although the Tang Dynasty established its capital in the Yellow River basin, the center of gravity was actually in the Jianghuai region. From the An Lushan Rebellion and the emergence of regional warlords onwards, the empire often relied on the tax revenues of Jianghuai as the foundation for pacification. While the three garrisons of Hebei were restless, the area between Liang and Yi remained safe and sound, at that time known as ‘Yang first, Yi second’. After the Tang and Song dynasties, the situation in the Southeast increasingly affected the overall safety and stability of the country. Although the Yuan and Ming dynasties established their capitals in Beiping, the capital was in danger as soon as the Grand Canal was interrupted. Therefore, the safety of river and sea transport was linked to the national plans of the Yuan and Ming dynasties. This demonstrates that the political center and the economic center cannot be separated, like paralysis in a human body. The Yuan and Ming dynasties suffered from this problem. We must not repeat the same mistakes. We propose that the National Assembly adopt Huang Zongxi of the Ming Dynasty's wise plans and follow the teachings of the Founding Father to decide on establishing the capital in Nanjing. As for the claim that establishing the capital in Beiping would be beneficial for national defense, it does not seem justified. Since the Ming Dynasty abandoned Danning in the east and ceded Dongsheng in the west, the nine border garrisons never had a peaceful day. During the Jiajing era, the capital was threatened by invasions every year. History is not far removed; there is no reason to emulate it. Before the Qing Dynasty established trade relations, the reason why the capital could be secure was due to the consolidation of the outlying regions. Today, circumstances have changed, science has advanced, and the national defense landscape has also transformed. Furthermore, in accordance with the sound practices of modern parliamentary politics, current representative bodies must accommodate people from all walks of life, allowing them to freely discuss and deliberate together, in order to reflect the reality of popular politics. Therefore, we request that the constitution, in addition to adopting a regional representation system, also adopt a professional representation system, so that everyone has the opportunity to serve the country. This is our deepest hope."

The Immense Contributions of the Professional Sector: Representatives Should Be Included in the Constitution

[Another dispatch] Fang Zhi, chairman of the Shanghai Special City Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party, and committee members Chen Baoyi, Zhuang Heren, Shen Chunhui, Ge Kexin, Zhou Feicheng, Zai Shixi, Xie Dahuang, Chen Baotai, Wang Xianqing, Qian Jianqiu, Zhou Xuexiang, Xie Renzhao, Tao Baichuan, Luo Qinghua, Xu Mingya, Wu Kaixian, and Zhang Xiaosong, yesterday sent a cable to the National Assembly, stating their reasons and requesting that professional representatives be included in the constitution. During the eight-year war of resistance, the various professional units exerted tremendous power and made significant contributions to the country. Moreover, in terms of the participants in this assembly, professional representatives also occupy a considerable number of seats. Professional organizations are able to participate in the constitution-making process today, but if they are not allowed to participate in the constitution-implementing process in the future, this would be contrary to both law and reason, and also inconsistent with human sentiment. Therefore, we dare to express our humble opinion in a cable, earnestly requesting that based on facts and reason, professional representatives be included in the constitutional draft, so that the National Assembly in the future can truly represent the consciousness of all sectors of society and reflect them in national policies, in order to jointly implement the constitution and build the nation together.

### The Ruin of Industry in Our Northeastern Provinces: The Soviet Union Should Bear Major Responsibility: The Release of Paulley's Official Investigative Report

[United Press, Washington, 13th] According to reliable sources obtained here tonight: Reparations Commissioner Paulley has reported to the State Department that the Soviet Union's removal of industrial equipment from the Northeast has delayed China's economic development by thirty years, while also hindering U.S. policy. Paulley's report is based on investigations conducted this summer together with experts from MacArthur's headquarters.

[Associated Press, Washington, 13th] The official report submitted to President Truman by Japanese reparations investigation commissioner Pauley on November 12 was released to members of Congress today. The report straightforwardly points out that the Soviet Union should bear major responsibility for the ruined state of industry in China's Northeastern provinces. It also states that Japanese military equipment and ammunition seized by the Soviets fell into the hands of the Chinese Communists with the unintentional cooperation of the Soviet Union. Pauley claims that the chaos caused by this Soviet action has created a state of political and economic instability that will take a long time to correct. The local people are suffering from hunger, cold, and unrest. The Northeastern provinces, rich in resources and factories, should logically be the starting point for China's revival.

### Moving and Destroying Industry in the Northeast Has Far-Reaching Strategic Implications

From the time of Japan's surrender until the Pauley investigation team conducted its on-site inspection, the losses to factories in the Northeastern provinces were estimated at $2 billion. It has not been possible to accurately estimate how much of the damage was directly caused by the Soviets, and how much should be attributed to looting, civil war, and the indirect results of the Soviet occupation. In any case, the Soviet government must bear major responsibility. The excuse that the removed materials were "war booty" needed to compensate for the losses suffered by the Soviet Union from German aggression does not fully conceal the facts. For example, the situation in Korea was completely different. In fact there was no important removal or destruction of Korean industry, which is clear proof that the Soviet policy had far-reaching strategic implications. It also cannot be justified to say that the benefits the Soviet Union gained from moving goods from the Northeastern provinces could have been replaced by reparations from the Japanese mainland. In addition to the industrial removals, the Soviet army also confiscated $3 million worth of gold bars. Although the investigation team did not find direct evidence proving that the Soviet Union had aided the Chinese Communists in the Northeastern provinces, it is true that the Soviet Union did not hinder the Chinese Communists. Large quantities of Japanese military supplies and ammunition seized by the Soviet Union fell into the hands of the Chinese Communists with the Soviet Union's intentional or unintentional cooperation. Restoring the industry in the Northeastern provinces requires remembering that the Northeastern provinces are in fact surrounded by territory wholly or partially controlled by the Soviet Union, making this vast area vulnerable to further Soviet encroachment. The Soviet Union's short campaign in the Northeastern provinces does not entitle the Soviet government to consider the majority of Japanese assets in the Northeastern provinces as reparations. Other countries also have the right to make claims. In short, the Soviet Union's confiscation and removal of food supplies and machinery in the Northeastern provinces, as well as the damage caused at the same time and afterwards, caused the local production to almost completely stop, greatly harming the Chinese people, and showing no consideration at all. All of this proves that there were far-sighted strategic reasons behind the Soviet actions. The Soviet Union not only industrially damaged the area, but even encouraged Chinese mobs to loot and even filmed their looting.

### Ignoring the Provisions of the Sino-Soviet Treaty: Dalian Has Actually Been Blockaded

Pauley continued: The Soviet Union took most of the electrical equipment, experimental plants, experimental projects, and hospitals from the Northeastern provinces, as well as the newest and best machine tools. Not only were houses and building equipment removed, but also equipment such as generators and mining water pumps, causing electricity to stop and mine shafts to be flooded, causing significant losses. The removal of electrical equipment halted all existing industrial production. Water and drainage projects in major cities could not operate due to insufficient power. The Sino-Soviet treaty of August 1945 stipulated that Dalian would be a free port and that the Soviet Union would only have the right to use a portion of the port's facilities. The Sino-Soviet Union ignored the treaty provisions and actually blockaded it for its own use. The damage the Soviet Union caused in the Northeastern provinces can be estimated in U.S. dollars as follows:

Electricity: $21.1 million
Coal: $50 million
Steel: $13.126 million
Railways: $22.139 million
Metallurgical Engineering: $16.3 million
Non-ferrous Minerals (excluding coal): $10 million
Liquid Fuels and Lubricants: $1.038 million
Chemicals: $14 million
Cement: $2.3 million
Textiles: $3.8 million
Paper and Pulp: $7 million
Wireless, Telephone, and Telegraph: $2.5 million

### The Soviet Union Obtained Rich Uranium Deposits in the Northeast: American Newspapers Claimed it was a Reliable Report

[United Press, New York, 13th] A dispatch from Shanghai by Scripps-Howard newspaper reporter Niu Deng cited reliable sources as saying that in addition to recently obtaining large quantities of tungsten ore from the Chinese government, the Soviet Union has also obtained rich uranium ore recently discovered in China. The reporter claimed that, according to reliable information, this uranium ore was originally discovered by the Japanese army in Haicheng, Liaoning, in the Northeast. Haicheng is 140 miles from the Soviet military base of Lushun.

### UNRRA Cables Reply to Zhou Enlai and Others: No Injustice in the Distribution of Supplies: The Chinese Communists Cable Again, Requesting to Attend the UNRRA Council Meeting

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu sent the following three suggestions to UNRRA Director LaGuardia on the 4th: (1) Request to directly carry out relief work in the "Liberated Areas" of China; (2) Allocate a reasonable portion of the untouched supplies to the "Liberated Areas" of China, to be distributed jointly by the "Liberated Areas Relief Association" and UNRRA; (3) Representatives of the "Liberated Areas Relief Association" should be invited to attend the UNRRA Council meeting to be held in Washington on December 10. UNRRA Deputy Director Lucks cabled back on the 9th, stating that relief work in the "Liberated Areas" was underway, and that the matter of attending the UNRRA Council meeting had been referred to Li Zhuomin, the official representative of China. After receiving this cable, the Chinese Communist delegation felt that it was unfair, and on the 13th, they cabled UNRRA Director and the Council again, once again requesting that the Chinese Communist requests be submitted for discussion by the Council.

[This newspaper's report] Wu Yunfu and Cheng Run, representatives of the Chinese Communist "Liberated Areas Relief Association" stationed in Shanghai, yesterday received reporters at Zhou Enlai's residence on Sinan Road, and released two telegrams signed by Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu on December 13, one to UNRRA Director LaGuardia and one to LaGuardia and the Council. These two telegrams were a response to General Lucks' cable, which refused to consider the Chinese Communist proposals.

Lucks' Reply Cable

[Reuters, Nanjing, 14th] General Lucks, who will succeed UNRRA Director as of December 31 (currently Deputy Director), specifically cabled Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu today, regarding Chinese Communist criticism that UNRRA's distribution of relief supplies to the liberated areas was unfair, stating that the fair distribution of UNRRA supplies continues to be the firm goal of UNRRA in China. The UNRRA office in China is continuing to pay close attention to overcoming transportation and other difficulties in order to achieve the aforementioned goal. Both the UNRRA office in China and the Executive Yuan state that they are taking active steps to develop and use available transportation assets to transport supplies to areas in need. General Lucks also said that a definite agreement has been reached regarding assistance to residents of the Yellow River area, and that this plan, which is of great importance to China, is expected to be completed smoothly. General Lucks' cable continued, regarding the request for the UNRRA "Liberated Areas Relief Association" to establish an agreement, that Wu Yunfu, the liaison officer of the latter stationed at the Executive Yuan in Shanghai, has been in regular contact with UNRRA and the Executive Yuan regarding relief matters in the "Liberated Areas." It is also understood that officials of the Liberated Areas Relief Association in various regions are actively participating in the distribution of supplies, and it is believed that this measure will increasingly improve the effectiveness of the assistance. As for your request to invite a representative of the "Liberated Areas Relief Association" to attend the 6th Council meeting of UNRRA, it has been submitted to Li Zhuomin, the chief representative of China, but each section of the incoming cable will not be discussed at the 6th meeting of UNRRA.

Zhou and Dong's Cables Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu, Chairman of the Chinese Communist "Liberated Areas Relief Association," after receiving Lucks' cable, replied to LaGuardia, saying that Lucks did not understand the political divisions regarding relief affairs in China, and the seriousness of the unfair distribution, and that Lucks' refusal to submit our statement for discussion at the 6th meeting of UNRRA in itself constituted discriminatory and unfair behavior, which was extremely regrettable. We believe that discussing this matter at the UNRRA meeting is the most satisfactory solution to the serious state of relief work in the country, so we cannot help but make this request again.

Another telegram from Zhou and Dong to LaGuardia stated: The black curtain of relief work in China previously revealed by 300 UNRRA staff members, such as corruption, using relief goods for civil war, and unfair distribution, has not improved at all. UNRRA's basic policy of non-political discrimination has not been followed. Although the Liberated Areas Relief Association has a liaison officer stationed at the Executive Yuan in Shanghai, the officer has no power and therefore cannot be considered an improvement. Furthermore, the issue of fair distribution of relief goods itself is extremely urgent.

### UNRRA is Planning to Reclaim Farmland in Flood-Affected Areas in China: Repairing the Yellow River Levees to Prevent Flooding

[Associated Press, Washington, 13th] UNRRA authorities hope to reclaim 2 million mu of farmland in flood-affected areas of China in 1947. This is one of the main plans for UNRRA's final fiscal year, which stipulates the repair of Yellow River levees in Henan, Anhui, and Shandong provinces to prevent flooding and facilitate planting. These levees were destroyed during the war of resistance to hinder the Japanese advance. UNRRA is dissolving, but less than half of the $535 million plan for China has been completed, and it will be completed to the extent permitted by the military and political situation in China.

### The Refugee Problem in Nanjing is Serious: The Central Government Will Send Senior Officials to Handle Relief: Relevant Authorities Formulating Solutions

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] The refugee problem in Nanjing is becoming increasingly serious. According to statistics from two weeks ago, there are already 12,000 people concentrated in Xiaguan, and another 2,000 arrived yesterday, with more expected to arrive. Shen Yi said at a press conference on the afternoon of the 14th: "This is a current national problem that the city of Nanjing itself can solve. The central government is paying close attention to this. In addition to personally inspecting the refugee areas, President Chiang personally instructed the Joint Logistics Headquarters to distribute cotton clothing. The central government may appoint senior officials to handle this matter specifically." He also pointed out that this matter is related to the blocking of the Yellow River, because the blocking project has not been carried out smoothly for some reason, and the floods in Anhui province are quite serious, with as many as 10 million refugees in one province. Some of them are taking refuge in Nanjing, and the number of arrivals is increasing daily. Fortunately, with the assistance of all parties, the refugees' clothing, food, and housing have been adequately resolved. Now, the central government and relevant parties intend to use the following methods to deal with this problem: (1) For the sake of getting to the root of the problem, they plan to engage in relief work upstream, so as not to trek to Nanjing; (2) Sending refugees back to their hometowns, about 2,000 people have been sent, but some have returned; (3) Using the method of work-for-relief to solve the lives of young refugees. The dike committee recently held a meeting on this.

### Nanjing's Population is Close to One Million: More than 200,000 Unemployed

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] The Nanjing Police Department announced that in November, the population was 575,232 men and 408,028 women, for a total of 983,260 people, an increase of 53,255 people compared to October. There are 243,097 unemployed people and 77,334 children out of school.

### The Yongding River Levees in Hebei Will Begin Construction Soon

[Central News Agency, Baoding, 14th] During the late Qing Dynasty, the Yongding River was "heavy on the north and light on the south," and the levees were completely submerged by wind and sand. The section from Hulubao to Focun in Wanping County is particularly vulnerable to floods during each flood season. In order to solve the problem once and for all, the Hebei Provincial Government has formulated a repair plan and requested 360,000 pounds of relief flour from the UNRRA Tianjin branch to be used as food for the workers. The Wanping County Provisional Assembly has recently established an advisory committee for the Yongding River south bank repair project. It is expected that the entire project will be completed before the major floods next June. The section will require 60,000 workers, and construction can begin within days.

### We Are Negotiating with the Philippine Authorities: Overseas Chinese Seek to Build Their Own Markets: Requesting that the Philippine Nationalization Act be Temporarily Suspended

[Central News Agency, Manila, 13th] According to the observations of local impartial people, in order to achieve a more deliberate solution to the order to nationalize the markets in the Philippines, fair principles must be applied, and both countries should mutually recognize each other's difficulties, and consider the historical background and the implications of the special status of overseas Chinese in the Philippines today. The legal issue of Republic Act No. 37, the National Public Market Act, has recently arisen. It authorizes the Ministry of Finance to formulate regulations for the management of markets. At a recent meeting, city senators pointed out that the Ministry of Finance is an administrative body, not a legislative body, and has no right to formulate this decree. Furthermore, no international law or other laws can ignore the established facts. History records that overseas Chinese have been doing business in the Philippine markets for over a century. During Spanish rule of the Philippines, overseas Chinese were actively engaged in commercial activities in the markets. After years of arduous struggle and work, they finally completed prosperous careers in these businesses. Over time, Filipinos gradually entered a new stage of recognition of this important industry. Although they attempted to compete with overseas Chinese vendors, they repeatedly failed. During American rule of the Philippines, Filipinos repeatedly resolved to use laws to expel overseas Chinese from the markets, but they were unsuccessful. Now, due to this feeling of jealousy, Filipinos are engaged in formulating laws to exclude overseas Chinese from the markets. Roxas signed this decree on October 1. Since then, Philippine officials have repeatedly stated that this decree is not discriminatory or intended to exclude overseas Chinese merchants, but as a result, overseas Chinese vendors are in danger of being forced to withdraw from public markets due to restrictions imposed by regulations announced by the Ministry of Finance. This sudden order from the Philippine authorities will undoubtedly have a serious impact on 1,045 law-abiding overseas Chinese and their 2,000 family members in the Philippines. In addition to legal issues, local impartial people have raised another question: Whether the actions taken will achieve the desired goals of the initiators. President Roxas hopes that this bill will further encourage Filipinos to engage in retail commerce, so that they can compete more effectively with foreigners, but in reality, overseas Chinese only account for 10% of the entire market stalls in the Philippines, and they are not actually in a controlling position in the market commerce of the Philippines. Since rejecting this bill is impossible, the only way out is to establish overseas Chinese' own markets. This is what Roxas allowed, and later suggested by Quirino. It is heard that our embassy will seek special approval from the parliament or reach an administrative agreement with the Philippine government to approve overseas Chinese to operate their own markets, while also requesting the Philippine government to postpone the implementation of the bill until the overseas Chinese markets have been established. If such a method fails, the only option left for the overseas Chinese is to file a lawsuit in the International Court of Justice.

### Neutral Zone for Overseas Chinese Established in Haiphong: We Are Seriously Negotiating: The Unfriendly Behavior of the Vietnamese is Increasing

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] Regarding the threat to the lives and property of overseas Chinese in Haiphong, according to Ye Gongchao, director of the European Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Our demand for the establishment of a neutral zone for overseas Chinese in Haiphong has never changed its position, because the Vietnamese-French dispute has not been satisfactorily resolved, and our overseas Chinese compatriots will continue to feel unpredictable threats. The government is currently seriously negotiating with both sides, urging the rapid delineation of the neutral zone.

[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 13th] At a time when Franco-Vietnamese relations are deteriorating, although the Vietnamese government authorities have repeatedly stated that they will protect overseas Chinese and that Sino-Vietnamese relations are friendly, since the Franco-Vietnamese conflicts in Haiphong and Lang Son, according to reports from various sources, the attitude of Vietnamese towards overseas Chinese has become increasingly hostile. Although the Vietnamese government authorities have no intention of excluding overseas Chinese, the fact that Vietnamese people are hostile to overseas Chinese in Haiphong, Lang Son, Hanoi, and other places has been repeatedly seen. In Haiphong, during the Franco-Vietnamese conflict, more than 300 overseas Chinese were groundlessly captured by Vietnamese soldiers. The Vietnamese government has recently used the excuse of instability to search the residences and shops of overseas Chinese in various places on a large scale. When arresting our overseas Chinese compatriots without cause, they are accused of colluding with the French army to resist the Vietnamese government, or even accused of being bandits. The certificates issued by our consulates held by overseas Chinese compatriots are not respected. Our Consul General in Hanoi, Yuan Zijian, believes that the neutral status of overseas Chinese in the Franco-Vietnamese conflict should be respected by both parties, and has asked both parties to take measures to protect the safety of overseas Chinese. The Franco-Vietnamese authorities have also reiterated their commitment to do their best to protect them. In fact, reports of overseas Chinese being oppressed by Vietnamese people and their residences being searched are still frequently heard, and the unfriendly behavior of Vietnamese towards overseas Chinese continues to increase.

### Bowers' Stolen Documents: Investigation Without Clues: Bowers Thanks Us for Our Cordial Hospitality

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 13th] Sir Bowers, head of the British trade delegation to China, had his briefcase containing official documents stolen on the street yesterday. Police arrested three suspects related to the incident this afternoon, but the stolen briefcase containing the official documents is still missing.

[Another dispatch] On the eve of his return to the United Kingdom, Bowers issued a statement thanking the Chinese government and the Hong Kong government for their cordial hospitality to his delegation. Bowers said: The delegation members have had direct and extensive discussions with the people of China and the United Kingdom. Chinese officials freely discussed China's various future economic plans with the delegation members. They were well-received by President Chiang in Nanjing.

### He Siyuan Plans to Build a New Beiping into an International Tourist City

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 14th] Our country has signed an agreement with American Airlines to open three air routes, directly from the United States to China. Tianjin is also one of the terminal points of the three major air routes. Next year, many Americans will visit the famous city of Beiping. To this end, the Mayor of Beiping, He Siyuan, has formulated a plan to build Beiping into an international tourist city. Under this plan, it includes increasing and improving hotels and restaurants, establishing guiding agencies, and strengthening international news in newspapers. He believes that this kind of plan is to allow foreigners to understand Chinese culture and modern style.

### Tanggu New Port Lock Fully Completed, Trial Voyage Today, Ready to Open

The New Port Engineering Bureau is scheduled to hold a trial voyage on the 15th, and it will be officially opened soon. At the beginning of the takeover, only 80% of the New Port lock was completed. After the New Port Engineering Bureau actively continued the repair, it is now completed. In the future, ships can directly enter and exit Jingu through the lock and waterway, without having to pass through the Daji Lanmen shoal again. Even at low tide, ships with a draft of less than 16 feet can also enter the port. The Dagu shipping has now entered a new stage.

### Sichuan Construction Issues, He Beiheng Returns to Chengdu and Tells Reporters, Negotiations in Beijing are Successfully Concluded

[Central News Agency, Chengdu, 14th] He Beiheng, the director of Sichuan Construction, recently flew back to the provincial capital from Beijing. According to reporters, the Sichuan construction issues have been negotiated and the results are quite satisfactory. The Dujiang Power Plant plans to initially generate 50,000 kilowatts, then increase to 200,000 kilowatts, and finally reach 1 million kilowatts. Some of the generators have been allocated and are currently being shipped from Shanghai to Sichuan, and will arrive in Chongqing within a few weeks. In addition, the Changshou 50,000 kilowatt power plant has been decided to be built by the National Resources Commission, which will solve the electricity problem in Chongqing in the future. The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has started construction, and the loan agreement with the French banking group has been negotiated and will be signed soon. The 26 billion yuan borne by the central government has been included in the 36th year budget and will be allocated as planned.

Editorial

### The Prerequisite for Saving Industry and Commerce

When it comes to politics, everyone feels that the biggest problem now is the lack of cooperation in all aspects. If the Kuomintang and the Communist Party sincerely cooperate, then all military, financial, economic, transportation, and other issues would have been easily resolved. In the past year or so, the results of all restoration work would definitely not be lower than those of the defeated countries.

Politics is like this, and economics is no exception. The crisis in industry and commerce is deepening day by day. All parties are racking their brains, trying to find the source of the disease, hoping to prescribe the right medicine and apply an emergency and effective treatment. Unfortunately, all kinds of diseases have broken out, and there are too many clues, making it feel like a tangled mess that cannot be untangled. Many people have become pessimistic about this, believing that the future is not bright. Everyone feels that during the Anti-Japanese War, although there were many difficulties and hardships, everyone still felt that there was a shadow of final victory in front of them, vaguely visible. No matter how difficult it was, they could still comfort themselves and not fall into a state of confusion and despair. However, the current economic situation is getting more and more serious, and collapse is imminent, but there is no bright shadow leading the way, and there is no definite and feasible way to solve it. Inevitably, they go from anxiety to confusion, and from confusion to seeming to enter despair and hopelessness. Aren't most industries and businesses struggling blindly now? How much of the future business direction has a reliable grasp?

So, what is the source of the disease? Is there a way to save it? The answer doesn't seem hard to find. Because after carefully examining everything, we feel that all the problems, like politics, arise and grow from the point of non-cooperation. Therefore, to prescribe the right medicine, we only need to start from the point of cooperation, and it will not be difficult to achieve success day by day. Here are a few facts to prove it.

Everyone knows that high interest rates, high wages, and high tax rates are now the fatal wounds of the industrial and commercial sectors. But as far as high interest rates are concerned, it is not really impossible to suppress them. The law of supply and demand tells us that as long as the money supply is ample and financing is convenient, then the interbank lending rate will naturally fall. If general industrialists and merchants can borrow from banks and money houses at a low interest rate of four or five percent, why would they borrow high interest rates of twenty or thirty percent from money lending companies? The problem is that it is really not easy to borrow at a low interest rate of four or five percent. Those who can borrow must be given more favorable conditions. However, commercial firms that adjust surpluses and deficits do not actually have enough chips to turn around, and those with sufficient chips are inconvenient to supply funds at any time for various reasons. The supply of funds will create many unexpected evils, such as grain loans, hoarding, speculation, and re-lending at high interest rates, which are often heard. Recently, a certain silk factory borrowed 100 million yuan and went bankrupt. From this point of view, although there are many types of loans in terms of supply, are their quantity and method capable of curbing high interest rates? In terms of demand, are all the funds used for legitimate purposes? It seems that both parties have not carefully considered these questions. That is to say, neither party has sincerely cooperated to find an effective solution to the problem. They are just dealing with the problem piecemeal and superficially. If this continues, how can high interest rates be curbed?

When it comes to wages, the general view is that current wages seem to be too high compared to other general salaries. Comparing domestic and foreign prices, we also feel that the cost of domestic goods is too high. But how to reduce costs and how to adjust wages is still an ideal. In other words, so-called labor-management cooperation is still just empty talk in general.

Then there is the issue of high tax rates. This includes too many types and various burdens similar to taxes. If we say that the authorities are far away and do not know this pain, then we would be slandering them. However, due to the facts, we cannot avoid taking care of one thing and losing sight of another. When we are eager to eat chicken eggs, we cannot take care of the life of the chicken. If we can shift our focus from the concept of pure income to the tax policy and even the conservation policy, that is to say, if the government and businesses truly cooperate to resolve the current crisis in industry and commerce, then this is an easy task, and it is not very difficult.

In addition to the above, there are also foreign goods dumping, rampant smuggling, high freight rates, lack of raw materials, insufficient power, and improper control, which are also important factors causing the economic crisis, but there are not countermeasures. What is regrettable is that while working hard to solve the problem, some are secretly destroying it, while enduring sacrifices, some are profiting from it, and some of the handlers do not care about life or death, using their power to plan for personal gain. As a result, all good laws and intentions are mixed with other private interests and effects, or are insincere, or are changed in form and name, so-called the oranges become trifoliate oranges when they cross the Huai River, and finally the desired effect is not achieved. Therefore, the current crisis in industry and commerce is not without a solution, but the problem is that all parties do not have the sincerity to cooperate, so that the law cannot be implemented, or the implementation is not thorough. If we want to achieve results, first of all, we must start from the practical cooperation of all parties.

### Kunming Wujiaba Airport Transport Plane Crashes and Burns, All Five People on Board Killed, Unable to Parachute

[Our Newspaper, Kunming, 14th] An Air Force No. 160 transport plane carrying equipment from Kunming to Chongqing at 9:00 a.m. on the 13th.

### Savange Spends the Year in Shaanxi, Will Go to Xi'an the Day After Tomorrow, Then to Other Places

[Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 14th] Savange is scheduled to come here on the 17th and go to various places in the province to survey, mainly the Hukou of the Yellow River, Longmen, and Yumen, which are also one of the three major hydropower generation areas in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's National Construction Strategy. The Hukou waterfalls have frozen, and the ice is connected like a mountain, which will not thaw until March of next spring. This place is east of Yichuan County, near the Communist area, and it may be difficult for Savange to smoothly travel north along the river and complete this trip. Other survey schedules have been arranged, and it is expected to stay in Shaanxi for two weeks, and go to Yulin after Christmas to inspect the Sanmenxia in Shanzhou, or spend New Year's Day there.

[Another dispatch] A telephone call from Hubei County on the 13th: Savange arrived here this afternoon to refuel and fly, leaving a historical footprint in Shaanxi Province, the most important province in wartime water conservancy.

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 14th] The river surface near Shaanxi County is now frozen, and there seems to be no fear of winter floods.

### The Head of the Arson Case at the Old Taoist Temple in Beiping Sentenced to Long Prison Terms, Other Criminals Sentenced Separately

The Baiyun Temple Temporary Custody Committee will be established on the 19th. There will be twelve Taoists, as well as the Social Bureau, the Police Bureau, and local gentry to jointly manage this famous temple.

### The Price of Gold and US Dollars Falls Back in Beijing, The Price of Yarn Continues to Rise in Chongqing

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] After the soaring prices of gold and US dollars fell back, the black market price of US dollars rose to a peak of 650,000 yuan in the morning, but closed at 560,000 yuan in the afternoon. The price of gold rose to 350,000 yuan per tael in the morning, but fell to 342,000 yuan in the afternoon due to the sharp decline in the price of US dollars. The price of cotton yarn was stable and the transaction was light. Due to the cold weather and reduced supply of rain, the price of food has risen. The price of cooked rice is 47,000 yuan per stone.

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 14th] The financial market in Chongqing this morning: the highest price of gold bars was 344,000 yuan, and the closing price was 340,000 yuan; the highest price of cast bars was 335,000 yuan, and the closing price was 329,000 yuan; US dollars were 6,500 yuan, and US dollar public bonds were 3,300 yuan. The money supply is very tight. In addition, the cotton yarn market has continued to rise for several days due to rumors. The "silk thread" has risen rapidly under the purchase of yarn merchants, rising by more than 100,000 yuan in one day.

### A Diligent County Annals Museum

Editor: In this atmosphere of political turmoil and economic unrest, social figures are either struggling for a living or running for profit, and cultural undertakings have long been neglected. Especially, literary works like gazetteers have long carried the feeling of "Uselessness and not to be done!"

Recently, I returned to my long-separated hometown—Tangqi Town in Hangzhou County—In this town with an area of ​​several square miles, a Hangzhou County Annals Museum has recently been established, and many local well-known scholars have gathered in the museum, tirelessly devoting themselves to writing, which can be thanked as a modern cultural miracle. The county annals museum is located on the top floor of the Yuchuan Shushu Building on the south bank of the Grand Canal in the town, which is close to the city center but free from the noise. Without someone pointing the way, it is not easy to find the entrance. Inside, it is high, bright, quiet, and secluded, with bright windows and clean windows. In addition to the arrangement of several bookshelves and writing desks, only a few encouraging inscriptions from contemporary celebrities are hung, and the stack of old papers on the desk reflects a simple and unpretentious mood. Curator Wang Jianqing is a humble elder. He said to the author: "The county annals have not been revised for more than two hundred years. Due to the evolution of the times, the division of counties and cities, changes in mountains and rivers, and the loss of documents, it is urgent to continue the past and open up the future and revise the annals. County Magistrate Chen Wen hired people to establish the museum and actively carried out the work. At present, the compilation outline and the annual progress schedule have been approved. Following this compilation, it is necessary to conduct on-site investigations for matters related to the local area, products, water conservancy, and farmland, which are closely related to people's livelihoods, and it is necessary to use scientific methods to explain, understand, and verify the achievements. I believe that if we use it to do it, we will definitely be able to complete the mission. One of the compilation gentlemen in the museum, Yao Zhufu Xiaolian, used to be the president of the Salt Industry News and served as an editor at the Zhonghua Book Company for many years. His articles, textbooks, and teaching materials have long enjoyed a high reputation in the cultural world, and he once competed with Chen Sanli and Zhu Jiangcun. He has compiled the Haining Annals and other works, and is also an experienced craftsman. In addition, the gentlemen who are in charge of the compilation, Luo Jingfu and Xu Keqing, are all experts in history, geography, physics, commerce, and agriculture. Deputy Curator Lu Shushi has enjoyed a long-standing reputation in the party and political circles in the past. Today, he is dedicated to cultural undertakings and is also a first-class choice. On the one hand, we continue to visit and hire Hongshuo in this county in order to complete a gazetteer without any regrets."

Finally, Curator Wang said to the author very sincerely: "At the beginning of the establishment of this museum, there were not many funds, but in view of the fact that society is in a period of destruction to construction, if everyone does not put in some hard work, there is no hope for the future of the country. Therefore, I and the gentlemen in the museum, based on this awareness, write and research hard, and do not resign from hardships; in the past, although we could not hold the sword to defend the country, now we can only devote ourselves to the pen to fulfill our national duty." This time I returned to my hometown, I personally saw the academic style and diligent spirit of the Hangzhou County Annals Museum, and I was very impressed. I specially introduced it to the cultural fighters in the city to create a sense of inspiration and encourage them to move forward. (Xue Chu)

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 14th] When the United Nations General Assembly debated the issue of disarmament yesterday, US Secretary of State Byrnes gave a speech stating that the United States has less than 550,000 troops stationed abroad, of which 19,000 are stationed in China at the request of the Chinese government. The majority of the rest are stationed in Germany, Japan, Korea, Austria, and Venezia Giulia. Apart from the US occupation zones in Germany and Austria, the US only has "combat troops" stationed in the Philippines, China, and the Panama Canal Zone. Byrnes denied that the presence of US troops in China is a threat to peace. When referring to the issue of atomic weapons, Byrnes said, "If other countries agree to the control and supervision of atomic weapons, then the United States is willing to share its knowledge of manufacturing atomic weapons with other countries. If other countries do not have atomic bombs or cannot manufacture them, then they will easily agree to the control and supervision system. The Atomic Energy Commission should accelerate its work as much as possible. In short, we want to unite with all countries to jointly safeguard peace, not to engage in war. We want to strengthen international law so that the people of all countries in the world can obtain freedom and happiness."

British Foreign Secretary Bevin then spoke, agreeing with Byrnes's proposal, stating, "The United Kingdom currently has less than one million troops, which is very few. When it comes to atomic control, if countries have political prejudices, then the Atomic Energy Commission will not be able to find a solution. In short, we are always ready to provide the General Assembly with any information it needs in order to implement the various principles in the Charter."

[Our New York Correspondent's Exclusive Dispatch, 14th] When the United Nations General Assembly discussed the issue of universal disarmament yesterday, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union all expressed their full support. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov spoke after Bevin, but did not announce the number of Soviet troops at home or abroad, but repeatedly requested a comprehensive investigation of the troops of all countries. Molotov continued by saying that the United States' keeping the atomic bomb secret threatens world peace. Judging from the nature of the atomic bomb, it is used in the territory of other countries, not for defense, but clearly as an offensive weapon. Regarding the universal disarmament case, Molotov reiterated the Soviet Union's request that the investigation of the world's military situation must include the announcement of the location of troops of all member states and their missions. After Molotov's speech, the General Assembly announced that it would adjourn until 11:00 AM the next day, when it would discuss the Soviet Union's request for an investigation of troops.

### Political and Security Committee Passes Universal Disarmament Plan; Compromise on Troop Investigation Not Reached; To Be Sent Back to the General Assembly for Reconsideration

[United Press, New York, 13th] The UNGA Political and Security Committee today unanimously passed a universal disarmament plan, but the troop investigation case was decided by a vote of 29 to 4 to be submitted to the Security Council for discussion. The Soviet Union alone expressed dissent. The compromise plan for the investigation was proposed by the President of the General Assembly, Spaak, who urged the Security Council to decide as soon as possible which reports to invite member states to submit. However, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov is prepared to fight again at the General Assembly plenary meeting, and US Secretary of State Byrnes is also considering speaking on this issue. British Foreign Secretary Bevin will also attend with the delegation before departing for his country on the 14th of this month. The crux of the troop investigation issue is the Soviet Union's insistence that a complete report on armaments, including the atomic bomb, should be attached to any report on domestic troops. In its proposal, the Soviet Union only requested an investigation of the number of troops stationed abroad. Another complex issue is the United Kingdom's request for a permanent court to verify such reports, so the committee could not reach a compromise on this.

### Establishment of International Inspection Agency: Security Council Drafts Plan

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 13th] The Political and Security Committee today unanimously passed a resolution urging the Security Council to immediately draft a plan for the establishment of an international agency to supervise and control atomic weapons and other collective destructive tools. This resolution has now been submitted to the United Nations General Assembly for approval. The resolution is divided into nine points: (1) The General Assembly recognizes the need to implement universal disarmament as soon as possible. (2) It urges the Security Council to adopt all practical and necessary measures as a matter of urgency to achieve this goal. The various plans drafted by the Security Council for this purpose should be sent to all member states of the United Nations and then reviewed by a special meeting of the General Assembly. (3) It urges the Atomic Energy Commission to adopt methods for controlling atomic energy so that its use is limited to peaceful purposes. (4) The General Assembly should urge the Security Council to review the report of the Atomic Energy Commission as soon as possible so that the work of the commission can proceed smoothly. (5) The General Assembly should ask the Security Council to draft relevant measures for inspection work as soon as possible and provide effective guarantees so that countries that abide by the regulations are protected and not harmed by other countries that violate the regulations. These guarantees include controlling atomic energy and limiting and reducing armaments. (6) An international agency should be established immediately to implement the various measures passed for reducing and controlling armaments. (7) The General Assembly should urge the Security Council to expedite the arrival of the date for receiving the armed forces of various countries, and urge member states to withdraw their troops stationed on the territories of former enemy countries in a balanced and progressive manner, and to withdraw their troops stationed on the territories of other United Nations member states as soon as possible upon obtaining the permission of the countries concerned, as clearly stipulated in various conditions or agreements. (8) The various provisions included in the current resolution shall not change the resolution passed by the General Assembly on January 21, 1946, when the Atomic Energy Commission was established. (9) The General Assembly should call on all member states of the United Nations to provide the Security Council and the Atomic Energy Commission with all possible assistance in order to establish and maintain international peace and security.

### Veto Issue: Australian Motion Passed

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 13th] The General Assembly today passed the motion of the Australian representative, which urged the permanent members of the Security Council to avoid hindering the rapid and effective work of the Security Council when exercising their veto power. The motion was passed by a vote of 36 to 6, with 11 abstentions. China also abstained. Before the vote, Gu Weijun stated that the Chinese government currently opposes making any amendments to the Charter. If a plan can be found that is acceptable to all member states of the Security Council, the Chinese government is prepared to endorse it, but this time has not yet come.

### UN Trusteeship to Begin Spring Next Year

[Report] San Francisco, 14th Broadcast Flusing News: The United Nations Trusteeship, established following the League of Nations mandate system, will begin in the spring of next year. United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie is preparing to convene a ten-nation conference in Paper in February next year in order to determine the steps for implementing the United Nations trusteeship, promoting the economic and moral standards of the governed peoples, in preparation for implementing autonomy and joining the community of nations in the world. Since the United Nations has already passed eight draft trusteeship agreements, Belgium, New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdom, and France, as the governing authorities, are naturally members of the Trusteeship Council. What remains to be decided are the other members. [United Press, New York, 14th] The General Assembly today passed the trusteeship agreements of eight countries. The United Nations Trusteeship Committee may therefore be established on December 14. In addition to the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, France, China, Belgium, Australia, and New Zealand, two other countries will be elected to participate in the committee. Soviet representative Novikov expressed opposition to accepting this trusteeship agreement, believing that it violates the United Nations Charter, but his proposal was ultimately rejected by a vote of 30 to 6, with 11 abstentions.

### Cuba Suggests Return of Envoys to Poland, Yugoslavia, and Romania; Countries Withdraw Diplomatic Personnel from Spain

[Report] San Francisco, 14th Broadcast The Cuban representative issued a statement today suggesting that United Nations members withdraw their envoys stationed in Poland, Yugoslavia, and Romania. It is said that after United Nations member states withdraw their envoys stationed in Spain, the second step should be to recall their envoys stationed in Poland, Yugoslavia, and Romania.

[Report] London, 14th Broadcast: The United Kingdom and the United States have decided to recall their ambassadors to Spain.

[Reuters, London, 13th] After the United Nations recalled its ambassadors and ministers plenipotentiary stationed in Madrid, the senior diplomats remaining in Madrid will be only the Papal Nuncio, the Portuguese Ambassador, and the Swiss and Irish ministers.

[Reuters, Madrid, 14th] The Spanish cabinet held a meeting today, chaired by Franco, during which Foreign Minister Arteaga formally read out the resolution of the UN General Assembly regarding the recall of envoys from various countries stationed in Spain. A statement was issued after the meeting, saying that this resolution will make the majority of countries feel regret in the short term, because this measure has seriously violated the fundamental principles of the Charter.

### UN's Next Year Budget: China to Bear Six Percent

[United Press, New York, Flushing, 13th] The United Nations Budget Committee today passed next year's budget, totaling over $27 million. The approved budget for this year totaled over $19 million.

[Central News Agency, New York, 13th] According to the allocation table for the United Nations' next year's budget approved by the UN Budget Committee today, China will bear $2,504,400, accounting for six percent of the total budget. The United States bears the most, accounting for 39.018 percent of the total.

### Border Adjustment Rejected: Greece to Protest to the Four Powers

[Reuters, Athens, 13th] It is announced here that the Greek government has presented notes to the representatives of the Four Powers in Athens tonight, protesting the Allied nations' rejection of Greece's request for adjusting the Greek-Albanian border.

### UNRRA Distribution Method: Compromise Solution Reached

Six Hundred Million Yuan Worth of Supplies Still Awaiting Transport

[United Press, Washington, 13th] Regarding the distribution of the $626,000,000 worth of UNRRA relief goods that have not yet been shipped, the United States and the Soviet Union have differing opinions. The U.S. representative, Wood, argued that due to changing circumstances, relief goods allocated to Country A could be rerouted to Country B. The Soviet representative, Vinogradov, insisted that the distribution should follow the original decision made several months ago and should not be changed. After several days of dispute, the UNRRA's 48-nation representative conference finally passed a compromise proposal, stipulating that the issue of such rerouting could be handled by the UNRRA's nine-nation Central Committee at its discretion. The current session of the UNRRA Representative Conference can therefore be adjourned.

### Jinnah's Speech in England: Insists on Partition of India; Says Muslim League Will Convene its Own Constituent Assembly; Britain Has Not Abandoned Hope of Mediating the Indian-Muslim Dispute

[This Newspaper's Dispatch] New Delhi, 14th Broadcast: Jinnah received reporters today, stating that the Indian Muslim League will convene its own constituent assembly. It is claimed that the only solution to the Indian problem is the partition of India, with Muslims and Hindus each drafting their own constitution, holding their own meetings, and not invading each other. This is the only shortcut to solving the complex problem of India.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 13th] The leader of the Indian Muslim League, Jinnah, gave a broadcast speech tonight, stating that if the current tragedy within India is not overcome, and if the British government continues its current policy, the result will inevitably force India into a civil war, thereby causing repercussions throughout the world. The current situation in India is extremely dangerous. Hindus and Muslims are two different nations, clearly different in all aspects. Therefore, the only solution is to divide India into Pakistan and Hindustan. The sooner Britain expresses its support for the partition of India, the more opportunities there will be to avoid a terrible catastrophe.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 13th] Regarding the attitude that Britain will adopt towards the Indian problem in the future, according to well-informed sources here, the British Cabinet currently has two different viewpoints on this matter. It is heard that Prime Minister Attlee, Defense Minister Alexander, and Trade Minister Cripps all advocate adopting a compromise attitude. On the other hand, the Secretary of State for India, Lord Lawrence, and people in the India Office and the War Office believe that Britain should continue to occupy India until a satisfactory agreement is reached between the Muslims and Hindus. The last hope for Britain to mediate the Indian-Muslim dispute depends on the Viceroy of India, Wavell, and Lord Halifax, because Halifax and the Indian Mahatma Gandhi have a very close personal relationship, which is widely known. The Saudi Arabian delegation visiting the United States, on the right is Foreign Minister Faisal. (Special dispatch from the New York Times)

### A Great Undertaking of 1946: U.S. Navy's Antarctic Expedition; Long Journey, Extreme Cold; Perilous Winds and Waves, Unprecedented

[United Press, aboard the USS Mount Olympus en route to Little America, 15th] The U.S. Navy's Antarctic expedition's submarine, the USS Sennet, will, upon arriving in Antarctica, submerge under the ice and fire at the ice layers of the Ross Sea, and launch two torpedoes to see what the results are. According to the submarine's captain, Eisenhower, the ice floe will not be damaged in any way. The submarine has ten officers and seventy crew members, all of whom volunteered to participate in this expedition. The length of the underwater voyage, the coldness of the climate, and the danger of the winds and waves will be the most experienced by the USS Sennet. The submarine will take the opportunity to measure the ocean floor and collect marine microorganism specimens at the same time. In addition, there are 42 special cameras and film that can be used to take 34,000 pictures. In addition, the film for taking color pictures can also be used to take 12,000 pictures. There are a total of 50 photographers, most of whom are from the Navy, and some from the Army and Marine Corps. Mapping the Antarctic will be done from three aspects. Two groups of ships will circumnavigate Antarctica, each group supplied by Navy aircraft. The two groups of ships will send out ten aircraft to inspect the inland. Some aircraft can penetrate 700 miles inland. Another third group will send aircraft from the Little America ice airfield deep into the Antarctic hinterland. Therefore, the areas it passes through will be those that have never been discovered or mapped by predecessors. The aerial camera has three lenses, which can shoot vertically and can simultaneously capture a very large area at two oblique angles. The problem is whether the weather and the voyage will be as desired. If there are 15 to 20 days of good weather during the two months of the expedition for aerial photography, it will be considered fortunate.

[United Press, aboard the USS Mount Olympus en route to Little America, 13th] The U.S. Navy-sponsored Antarctic expedition will take four months, and will film the situation in various places at any time. It is hoped that 60 percent of the Antarctic region can be captured on film. If the weather is good, experienced aerial photographers will take a full view of this frozen area. The area is as large as the United States. After the photographs are taken, a part of the area that we could not see with our naked eyes before will be vividly displayed before our eyes. At the same time, a part of the secrets under the Antarctic ice and snow will also be drawn into the picture. The 68th Mobile Unit is responsible for this mapping work. The director of the Antarctic expedition film is Schellere, who has twice explored Antarctica and has rich photography experience. Aerial photographers have a total of 82 aerial cameras and 61 miles of aerial photography film, which can take 500,000 pictures. There are a total of 54 moving picture cameras, carrying 104 miles of film. The temperature may be as low as minus 60 degrees. Each photographer carries two cameras, in case one freezes. There are almost no routes or signs to follow, only relying on latitude and longitude instructions. Pilots have been specially trained. If everything goes smoothly, an accurate Antarctic terrain can be measured, which may provide clues as to where minerals are buried. Schellere first tried to explore Antarctica in 1928. He is very enthusiastic about this re-exploration. The supervisor will be Quake Bush, who supervised the production of atomic bomb tests. Quake is currently the Chief of Staff of Navy Rear Admiral Croson.

### Truman Meets with Saudi Foreign Minister to Discuss the Pakistan Dispute; Arab League Asks Britain to Lift Ban on Muslim Leader

[United Press, Washington, 13th] President Truman today discussed the Palestine dispute with Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Faisal. Faisal told reporters afterward that the Palestine issue was mentioned during the discussion, but only in general discussions of other common interests of both parties, and no details were involved. The Saudi Arabian government opposes President Truman's plan to allow a large number of Jews to immigrate to Palestine.

[United Press, Cairo, 13th] According to a statement today by Jamil Husseini, acting chairman of the Palestine Arab Executive Committee: The Arab League has passed a resolution authorizing the League Secretariat to request the British government to lift all bans on the exiled Mufti of Jerusalem, Jamil Husseini, and allow him to return to Palestine immediately. The Muslim leader secretly fled from Paris two months ago and has been under the protection of King Farouk of Egypt.

### Painless Childbirth: New Method Invented; Not Applicable to First-Time Mothers

[United Press, Philadelphia, 13th] Miles, a 34-year-old associate professor of obstetrics at the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine, recently reported at a press conference a new method of "completely painless childbirth," which uses a needle to inject "Pitocin," a derivative of the pituitary gland (sella turcica), to stimulate labor, combined with continuous spinal anesthesia (i.e., partial anesthesia by injecting anesthetic through a catheter). It is said that injecting "Pitocin" can activate the longitudinal muscles on the uterus, thereby promoting childbirth. The mother is conscious during childbirth. In the 63 trials conducted over two days, no one died. The longest labor time was four hours, and the shortest was only 35 minutes. However, this method cannot be used for first-time mothers because their uterine foundation has not yet grown. This new method is especially beneficial for mothers suffering from tuberculosis, diabetes, and heart disease.

### Iranian Troops Advancing at Full Speed: Completely Occupy the Capital of Azerbaijan; General Kabitari, Commander of Azerbaijan, Arrested; Soviet Union Asks Iranian Army to Stop Advancing

[This Newspaper's Special Correspondent, London, 14th] Although the Iranian issue has eased due to the surrender of the Azerbaijan army, the situation has become tense again today. According to news telegrams from Tehran received here, Soviet Ambassador to Iran, Sakchikov, has requested the King of Iran to immediately stop the advance of the Iranian government army in Azerbaijan, on the grounds that this advance may "cause disputes on the Soviet border." The King of Iran immediately replied that the Iranian army's advance would definitely not cause disputes, because the Azerbaijan militia has surrendered and its leaders have fled. According to the latest report: Iranian government troops have occupied the airport a few miles away from the city of Tabriz. When the weather turns better, government aircraft can begin to operate. As for the Azerbaijan militia who are stubbornly defending a part of Tabriz, they have now received an ultimatum from the government army. If they do not surrender early, they will be annihilated.

[Agence France-Presse, Tehran, 13th] According to a communiqué issued by the General Staff of the Iranian Army, the Iranian government army has completely occupied the capital of Azerbaijan, the city of Tabriz. Other government troops are currently advancing towards Tabriz in three routes, one in the southwest direction, one in the southeast direction, and one in the east direction. Other government troops have entered Kurdistan, where the leaders of the Azerbaijan Democratic Party have all fled.

[Reuters, Tehran, 14th] Iranian radio broadcast: General Kabitari, commander of Azerbaijan, was arrested in Tabriz today.

### Chinese Cargo Ship: Rescued After Encountering Danger

[United Press, San Pedro, California, 13th] The Chinese cargo ship "Hua Dong" set sail from here on Monday to return to its home country. It hit a reef and leaked 360 miles from Long Island. The American warship USS Faberlin has been providing rescue. According to the Coast Guard report, the sailors on board are not in danger. The nearby cruiser USS Allentown can also quickly arrive to provide rescue. The captain of the ship is Steel, and there are 34 American sailors.

### "Werewolf" Appears in French Normandy Countryside at Night

[Reuters, Paris, 13th] In the three villages of Placy-Guéhebert and Roucamps in Normandy, a strange person has appeared every night for six days, shooting randomly in the villages with a Thompson gun. Villagers call him "Werewolf." Last night, the "Werewolf" wandered the streets of Roucamps for four hours, shooting at the windows of houses along the street. The police and farmers have not yet seen the person's true face. Doctors believe that the person has a nervous breakdown at a fixed time, and has a homicidal appetite, but at other times he is no different from ordinary people. Therefore, he may be mixed among the villagers when he is not having a nervous breakdown, and will search for himself together with others. Therefore, the villagers are suspicious of each other.

### America Actively Prepares to Celebrate Christmas

[United Press, Washington, 13th] This year, more than 15 million Christmas trees will illuminate American families, and the abundance of Christmas gifts can also break records. It is expected that the general public will actively compete to purchase, and the retail total will exceed the 850 million dollars last December. Most of the Christmas trees come from the Northwest. Montana alone provides one-sixth of the total supply. Most of the Christmas trees used in the East come from Canada, and the total number transported to the United States is no less than 5 million trees.

### Blum Cabinet Expected to be Formed; Communist Party Proposes Conditions for Participation; Two Major Parties in the House of Representatives are Equally Matched; Increased Issue of Francs May Lead to Further Devaluation

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 13th] The new Prime Minister Blum told the press that he hopes that the new French cabinet can be organized tomorrow night. He has achieved major achievements in his talks with the leaders of various parties. The Radical Socialist Party has expressed its willingness to participate in the government. In short, he will do his best to strengthen the cabinet formation work. He hopes that the new cabinet can be formed tomorrow, which is especially urgent for everyone.

[Reuters, Paris, 13th] The Central Committee of the French Communist Party issued a communiqué tonight, stating the conditions for the party to join the coalition government, stating that it must first review Prime Minister Blum's proposals and measures before it can decide whether to participate or not. Furthermore, conservative parties must not participate in the coalition government. Reliable sources said that the Communist Party's intention is to obtain "one of the three key positions of foreign affairs, national defense, and internal affairs. [Agence France-Presse, Paris, 13th] The National Assembly met today and decided that when the National Assembly presents the list of members to the Senate of the Republic on Tuesday, the Communist Party and the People's Republican Movement will occupy an equal number of seats. Of the senators elected by the National Assembly, a total of 50 seats, 42 of which will be allocated to various political parties, with the Communist Party and the People's Republican Movement each occupying 12 seats. After the results of the elections in various overseas regions are revealed, the number of seats occupied by the two major political parties will be roughly equal, that is, the Communist Party has 73 seats, the People's Republican Movement has 74 seats, the Socialist Party ranks third with 45 seats, and the Radical Socialist Party has 28 seats. The total number of senators is 315, so there are still 51 seats to be elected by overseas regional parliaments. However, due to various environmental difficulties, the Senate will be established before the aforementioned 51 members are elected.

[Reuters, Paris, 13th] Although Blum's new government has not yet been formed, some people have already called it the government to rescue the franc. Although the French Ministry of Finance has repeatedly denied that the franc will be devalued again, the Bank of France's weekly report shows that the amount of francs issued has exceeded 700 billion francs. At the same time, the rapid rise in prices and the repeated demands of various unions for wage increases all indicate that the franc is actually rapidly devaluing. Some financial commentators estimate that the French government's budget deficit has reached a huge 400 billion francs, and the continued expansion of currency cannot be stopped without taking strong austerity measures.

### New Egyptian Political Party Announces a Party Program

### A Central Air Transport Corporation Passenger Plane: Suddenly Disappears En Route from Beijing to Shanghai; Carrying Several Boxes of Banknotes Shipped from Beiping to Shanghai; Only Two Passengers Besides the Flight Crew

[This Newspaper's Dispatch] A passenger plane of the Central Air Transport Corporation suddenly disappeared yesterday afternoon around 2 p.m. The whereabouts of the plane have not been determined as of 2 a.m. this morning. It is reported that a C-47 type No. 31 aircraft of the Central Air Transport Corporation flew from Beiping to Shanghai the day before yesterday. When passing through Nanjing, it stopped at Nanjing Ming Palace Airport overnight due to bad weather. The plane was loaded with several boxes of banknotes shipped from Beiping to Shanghai, and carried two passengers in Beijing. Yesterday afternoon at 2 p.m., the No. 31 aircraft was piloted by pilot Ma, co-pilot Zhang, and radio operator Zhong, and took off from Beijing to Shanghai. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 2:45 p.m. yesterday. However, after takeoff, the plane lost radio contact with the Beijing and Shanghai air stations. Its whereabouts have been unknown since then, and there has been no clue until late at night. Later, it was learned from the person in charge of the Central Air Transport Corporation's flight team: 30 minutes after the plane took off from Beijing, another Central Air Transport Corporation plane received a radio message from the No. 31 aircraft en route to Shanghai, but it did not see its whereabouts or destination. As for whether the plane had an accident on the way and was forced to land, it has not yet been determined as of late at night. In addition to the three flight crew members Ma, Zhang, and Zhong, the No. 31 aircraft only carried two passengers who boarded in Nanjing.

### Interruption of Sino-American Airmail; Post Office Explains Doubts

[Our Newspaper's Report] Recently, Sino-American airmail has suddenly been interrupted. Since mid-October, the American side has not received any airmail from China. As a result, overseas Chinese and business people in America have been calling to inquire, causing widespread concern. Yesterday, a reporter visited Mr. Wang Yuguang, Assistant Manager of the Shanghai Postal Administration, to inquire about the cause of the airmail interruption. It is said that the delivery of airmail between China and the United States has always been handled via the Manila Post Office. From Shanghai to Manila, it is transported by China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) planes, and from Manila to San Francisco, it is transported by Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) planes. Currently, CNAC's Shanghai-Philippines flights are operating as usual, so airmail is still being continuously transported to Manila. Therefore, the interruption is due to delays in Manila. It is rumored that the reason is the suspension of Pan Am flights, but the exact details are unknown. The Shanghai Post Office sent a letter to inquire two weeks ago, but has not yet received a reply. A telegram was sent on the 12th to follow up, and the truth will be announced as soon as a response is received. As for a remedy, there is only one air route between China and the United States, so there is currently no solution, and everything depends on the situation in Manila.

Pay Attention to Preventing Mail Theft

The reporter further inquired about recent rumors of unscrupulous individuals stealing mail from mailboxes, opening and reading the contents, and then defrauding the senders or recipients. Mr. Wang believes this is not the case. Not long ago, news reported this, and said that dozens of thieves had been caught, but the postal authorities immediately made detailed inquiries with the Garrison Headquarters and learned that this was not the case. To his knowledge, there was only one instance where a thief stole some letters from a mailbag while a postman was delivering mail in order to commit fraud. After the case was solved, postmen were ordered to pay more attention in the future. Mr. Wang continued that ten years ago, the style of mailboxes in this city was larger at the top and smaller at the bottom, so letters often piled up at the top, allowing people to use hooks to steal stamps. This was discovered and the design was changed to the current style. Of course, the theft of letters cannot be absolutely guaranteed to be non-existent now, but the loss of many letters is also due to the forgetfulness of the sender or the negligence of servants. Therefore, if citizens do find that their letters have been opened and they have been defrauded as a result, they can report the details, and the post office will do its best to investigate and prevent it.

Regulations of Two Airlines on Types of Valuables for Air Transport

In the past, the regulations of China National Aviation Corporation and Central Air Transport Corporation on the transport of ordinary goods versus valuables were not uniform, which inevitably led to misunderstandings. After consultation between the authorities of the two companies, the types of valuables were determined, and will be implemented simultaneously by the head office and branch offices in various places from today. The names of the air-transported valuables are as follows: (1) Radio vacuum tubes. (2) Silk. (3) Finished glass products. (4) Light bulbs. (5) Porcelain. (6) Cameras. (7) Gold. (8) Banknotes. (9) Certified securities (government bonds). (10) Pearls. (11) Antiques. (12) Jade. (13) Diamonds. (14) Watches. (15) Silverware. (16) Fountain pens. (17) Silver. (18) Ivory. (19) White fungus. (20) Bird's nest. (21) Deer antler. (22) Fritillaria cirrhosa. (23) Poria cocos. (24) Ginseng. (25) Cinnamon. (26) Notoginseng. (27) Musk. (28) Tibetan saffron. (29) Tires. (30) Shark fins. (31) Abalone. (32) Furs. (33) Woolen cloth. (34) Woolen yarn. (35) Serge. (36) Silk fabrics. (37) Cigarettes. (38) Injections (injection solutions, powders, pills). (39) Perfume essence. (40) Glycerin. (41) Straw hats. (42) Gems. All items other than those listed above are considered ordinary cargo. The freight rates for ordinary goods and valuables will remain the same as before.

Liao Honggan Abuses Porters; Rice Merchant Dies Under Gunfire

[Our Newspaper's Report] Liao Honggan, known as "Xiao Erduo," was accused by more than ten poor people of having served as an intelligence officer for the Japanese Kempeitai on Route Petain, and of abusing peddlers using enemy and puppet power. After being arrested by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, he was sent to the High Court. Yesterday afternoon, the High Court held a hearing. Ten plaintiffs appeared in court and stated in detail that Liao Honggan served as a guide for the enemy army and confiscated the rice, cigarettes, soap, gauze, and other items they were selling. One of them, Yan Wangshi's husband, was shot by the Japanese while selling rice and eventually died. They pointed out that Liao Honggan was also present at the time. Liao Honggan denied all the charges and countered that the plaintiffs were all in a master-disciple relationship and had personal grievances against him. The court ruled that further investigation was needed and adjourned the hearing. The defendant was remanded in custody.

[Our Newspaper's Report] Mai Bojun, who was accused of having served as the puppet plainclothes captain and puppet youth corps leader in Bo'ai County, Henan Province, appeared in court yesterday afternoon wearing a gray short jacket and black leggings, and bowed deeply to the court. The court questioned him one by one about the facts reported by the plaintiffs, Cheng Defu and Dan Zhongxin, such as demolishing houses, conducting household registration on behalf of the enemy, illegally detaining and torturing civilians, and assassinating Cheng Guangtiao, a graduate of Peking University. The defendant denied all charges, claiming that he was a small shop merchant in Bo'ai and illiterate. The court ordered that the Bo'ai County government be contacted for investigation, and adjourned the hearing. The defendant was remanded in custody.

Brothers in Trouble; Both Accused

[Our Newspaper's Report] The brothers Wang Wenfeng and Wang Wentian appeared in court yesterday.

### Five Trade Associations Call on the Council to Improve Tax Collection According to Law for the 34th Year Profit Tax

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Western Cuisine and Coffee Industry Association, the Shanghai Drama Industry Association, the Shanghai Ballroom Industry Association, the Shanghai Hotel Industry Association, and the Shanghai Restaurant Industry Association jointly requested the City Council to forward a letter to the Direct Taxation Bureau for the profit tax of the 34th year, to improve the collection according to the tax law. It stated: "Upon investigation, the members of our associations have all conscientiously followed the instructions of the authorities and truthfully declared the net profit obtained from the annual turnover, after deducting various expenses. However, upon receiving the payment notice from the Direct Taxation Bureau, the amount to be paid was calculated based on the annual net profit, exhausting all income, and then increasing it by 50 percent, which caused surprise. At the end of the year, once a business is settled and there is a surplus, shareholder dividends and employee bonuses must be allocated. If the surplus is taxed further, no one will bear the responsibility for the loss incurred, and the business will inevitably be forced into bankruptcy or closure. Our associations are aware of the difficulties of the times, and we hope that you will consider our request and forward a letter to the Direct Taxation Bureau to promptly improve the tax collection in accordance with the tax law, so as to alleviate the hardships of businesses and comply with reason and law, which is beneficial to the public."

Ballrooms Request Free Tea

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Ballroom Business Association recently appealed to the City Council for tax reduction, stating that the heavy taxes are unbearable. The four reasons are: (1) Entertainment tax has already been paid when purchasing dance tickets. Drinks are not entertainment and should not be taxed. The double taxation is detrimental to business. (2) In various theaters in the city, in addition to the tax on the tickets, there is no tax on tea, but ballrooms must pay taxes on tea, which is unfair. (3) Gasoline and beer have already paid factory tax when they leave the factory, and retail sales are not taxed separately according to law. Moreover, the wine and tea industries have already been exempted from taxes, while dance halls still have to pay taxes, which is obviously inconsistent with the law. (4) The collection of taxes on drinks in dance halls was a harsh tax during the enemy and puppet period. Now that the victory has been achieved for many years, it should be removed to alleviate the difficulties of businesses.

### Shanghai Telephone Company's Skyscraper; Location Selected at "Xingzong" Site; New European Machines Arrive in Shanghai in January

[Our Newspaper's Report] There are many rumors about the American-owned Shanghai Telephone Company building a tall new building, and the company is keeping it a secret. According to reporters, the new building of the Shanghai Telephone Company will be built on the site of the "Xingzong" near Fuzhou Road and Fourth Road. The site was originally enemy property and is an ideal location. The relocation of the telephone company is subject to the restrictions of the lines. It cannot be moved at will. The location is at the "center of the line", which is suitable for both the telephone company and telephone users. The Shanghai Telephone Company has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to purchase the property, and it is reported that the Executive Yuan's reply has arrived in Shanghai, indicating its agreement. Liu Gongyun, director of the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau, has also agreed to sell the site to the Shanghai Telephone Company, and the specific details are still being negotiated. Once the work of the "Xingzong" is completed, the telephone company will begin construction of the new building, which will be at least fifteen stories high. The new machines ordered by the Shanghai Telephone Company from the United States will be placed in the new building. The old machines at the original site on Jiangxi Road will also be moved to the new building, but most of them will be discarded. As for the Shanghai Telephone Company building on Jiangxi Road, it will be auctioned off. In addition: The new telephone machines ordered by the company from Europe will arrive in Shanghai in January next year. The new machines will be installed in the Shanghai Telephone Company on Fujian Road. At that time, the telephone panic in the city may be alleviated. Fang's confession, Gu has never left Shanghai, proving the bank signature and checkbook has never left Shanghai, in accordance with the law, surrender must be in person, so the judgment on May 9, 34th year, there are doubts, the High Court's decision to exempt him from punishment is inappropriate, so it has been requested to the Supreme Court on the previous day for retrial, please be returned for retrial. According to Gu, since the High Court's judgment, he has left Shanghai and fled to Hong Kong.

### Truth About Embezzlement by Xingzong Machinery Factory Staff Disclosed; Eleven Suspects Transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office

[Our Newspaper's Report] The deputy director of the Xingzong Zhenru Machinery Assembly Factory, an Australian named Xizhi, colluded with senior factory staff to embezzle and sell twenty boxes of aluminum sheets and fifty-five boxes of plywood worth more than 100 million yuan. After being reported by factory staff members such as Zhu Jiade, the General Office notified the Police Headquarters and requested the arrest and investigation of the relevant suspects. In mid-month, the Police Bureau arrested Yang Shenghuan (34 years old, Hunan), the factory's dispatch director, Li Luoshi (21 years old, Guangdong), the assistant yard supervisor, Ma Shiyi (21 years old, Hebei), a shipping department employee, Qian Zhengfu (23 years old, Jiading), the distribution group director, Xie Boluo (34 years old, Polish), the factory affairs director, Cao Chiming (36 years old, Zhejiang), a shipping department checker, and other six people in Xianyang Road 70 Alley 84, Meibaike Road 97 Alley 16, the same lane number 14, North Zhongzheng Road 102 Alley 21, and inside the Zhenru factory; And three recipients of stolen goods, Zhang Wuqing (owner of Hongkang Hardware Store, 168 Xinzha Road), Li Siheng (owner of Jingcheng Hardware Store, 211 Xinzha Road), and Huang Zhangbin (architect of Daxing Company, Room 303, Continental Building, 113 Jiujiang Road). In addition, Le Gang, a would-be extortionist, was arrested at 9 Hao, 401 Alley, Changle Road. He was a "Lian Zong" inspector, and after individual interrogations revealed that the principal was Deputy Factory Director Xi Zhi, the "Xing Zong" inspectors Hui Desen and Deng Tuolai arrested Bu at 165 Maiyang Road. After questioning by a U.S. attorney of "Lian Zong" and the Australian Consulate, it was confirmed, and the person was officially handed over to the Police Bureau on the 2nd of this month for joint handling. Due to the complexity of the case, the investigation was not completed until the day before yesterday, and the case was transferred to the District Attorney's Office for investigation. Now we explore and record the results of the police investigation as follows: Regarding the theft of aluminum sheets, (1) At the end of October of this year, Xi Zhi applied to the General Office for the allocation of ten boxes of aluminum sheets on behalf of the need for a new factory. He obtained the warehouse receipt in early November, but did not immediately deliver it to the new factory. Instead, he colluded with Qian Zhengfu, the distribution group director, to resell it to Wang Xiansheng, the owner of the Sino-American Oil Company. Qian received a reward of one million yuan. (2) On November 12 of this year, Yang Shenghuan, the factory's dispatch director, learned that Xi Zhi had applied for a warehouse receipt for ten boxes of lead sheets, so he jointly discussed with Li Luoshi, the field surveillance assistant, and obtained the consent of Xie Boluo, the factory affairs director, and Xi Zhi. After changing the warehouse receipt to a pick-up voucher, it was resold to Jingcheng Hardware Store in Xinzha Road for 11 million yuan. When Jingcheng sent someone to pick up the goods, they were stopped by Chen Chuanyao, the ticket checker and manager, because the lead sheets had been picked up by Wang Xiansheng. At that time, Xie and Li falsely claimed that this was another batch of goods, and the formal warehouse receipt was now with the deputy factory director, so the ten boxes of lead sheets in the factory were successfully stolen. Half of the stolen money was converted into 920 U.S. dollars. Except that Xi Zhi received 420 U.S. dollars and 5,000 legal tender, and Li Luoshi received 500 U.S. dollars, the rest was divided equally, and Chen Chuandeng also received a share. Regarding

The theft of plywood occurred on July 25, when Huang Zhangbin, an architect of Daxing Company, contacted Xi Zhi to purchase 55 boxes of plywood stored in the factory. Twenty-five boxes were transported to Guofu Road in Nanjing, and 30 boxes were transported to 586 Tangshan Road in this city. The payment was 11,000 U.S. dollars, as evidenced by a receipt signed and stamped by Xi Zhi. As for the attempted extortionist Le Gang, an inspector of "Lian Zong," he learned that Xi Zhi had stolen public property, and on the 21st of last month, he used the identity of a "Xing Zong" secret agent to threaten Xi and Xie to demand 20 million yuan, otherwise he would report to the General Office for handling according to law. Later, for safety reasons, Xie Boluo wanted to settle the matter with 10 million yuan, and just as he was about to pay, the incident was revealed and he was arrested by the police. A total of 20 lead sheets, 500 U.S. dollars, 2.2 million legal tender, and many other documents were seized.

### China Merchants Bureau Opens China-Philippines Route; Attracts Attention Among Peers

[Our Newspaper's Report] The state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is actively planning to expand overseas routes. It previously dispatched the Hai Xia to launch the China-Philippines route. The ship was sent to Hong Kong for repairs and painting of passenger seats in the middle of last month, and will be completed and launched soon. The passenger ticket prices and procedures for going abroad have also been announced. However, even before the ship has launched, it has attracted the attention of its peers and sparked competition. According to a report received by the Bureau from Nanyang, in order to compete with the Hai Xia, the Rong Xuan of De La Pama Company, which has been operating the Philippines-Xiamen route, has reduced passenger ticket prices by 40%. The first class has been reduced from 300 Philippine pesos to 185 pesos, and the third class has been reduced from 175 pesos to 110 pesos. However, the ticket prices previously set by the Bureau were not much higher than those of the Rong Xuan, so although there is a need for research, it is not greatly affected.

Hai Lie Sent to Sail China-Thailand Line

Also, the Bureau recently sent the Hai Lie to launch the China-Thailand line, sailing between Shanghai and Bangkok. The ship was repaired at the He Zong Factory and left the dock at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. Three small ships were dispatched to tow it, but due to the bad weather, there was some wind and waves at that time, making the work difficult. Therefore, although the ship had left the dock, there were minor problems, and the public was not aware of the details. In addition to the aforementioned China-Philippines and China-Thailand routes, the Bureau will also send the "Hai Tian", "Hai Di", "Hai Xuan", "Hai Huang", "Hai Zi", "Hai Chen", "Hai Su", and "Hai Zhang" and some landing craft to Japan, Korea, and various islands affiliated with Japan to transport surplus materials. Although the above ships have been sailing for a long time, the nationality certificates from the Ministry of Communications have not yet been issued. Ships currently sailing on international routes urgently need nationality certificates. The Bureau sent Fan Lun, director of the Maritime Section of the Shipping Department, to Beijing the day before yesterday to request the Ministry of Communications to issue them. It is heard that Fan will bring the nationality certificate of the Hai Lie back to Shanghai on Monday because it is urgently needed to launch the voyage to Siam.

### Taking Advantage of Low Water Season in Winter to Promote River Dredging; Public Works Bureau Settles on Concrete Measures; First Phase of River Dredging to Include Six Rivers

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Municipal Public Works Bureau has decided to take advantage of the low water season in winter to actively promote river dredging. Zhao Zukang, Director of the Public Works Bureau, specially convened the heads of various work zones of the bureau at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss implementation measures. The meeting was chaired by the Director General, and attended by Zhu Guoxi, Director of the Engineering and Structure Department of the bureau, Qian Weifan, Civil Affairs Commissioner, Zhang Xingmin, representative of the Civil Affairs Department, Sun Yongyi, representative of the Social Affairs Bureau, and the heads of various work zones. Concrete decisions have already been made.

The City's Rivers are Divided into Four Categories

The Shanghai River Dredging Regulations divide the city's rivers into four categories: (1) First-Class Trunk Rivers, (2) Second-Class Trunk Rivers, (3) First-Class Tributary Rivers, and (4) Second-Class Tributary Rivers. The funding for river dredging is determined according to their categories as follows: (1) Dredging costs for first-class trunk rivers are borne by the municipal treasury. If it involves neighboring counties, the city and the neighboring counties share the responsibility. (2) Dredging costs for second-class trunk rivers are borne by the municipal treasury. When necessary, the benefiting areas may be ordered to raise supplementary funds, not exceeding 50% of the total dredging costs. (3) Dredging costs for first- and second-class tributary rivers are entirely borne by the benefiting areas, but in special circumstances, a subsidy may be requested from the municipal government, with a minimum of 40% of the total costs.

Surveying Work Completed

The city's first-class trunk rivers are three: the Huangpu River, the Suzhou Creek, and the Zaojiaobang. It is currently impossible to start dredging them. Yesterday's meeting decided that the first phase of dredging will include six rivers, including the Zoumatang in Jiangwan and the Puhuitang in Longhua, which are second-class trunk rivers. The Shajinggang from Hongkou to Jiangwan, the Taoshupu from Dachang to Rugao, and the Dutai River and Majiabang in Pudong are first-class tributary rivers.

The surveying work for the above rivers has been completed. The first step in the dredging work is to establish river dredging committees in each district, with the head of the work zone serving as the chairman, and representatives of the district's residents and local gentry serving as committee members. The number of committee members is set at 15 to 17, and the organization must be completed by the 25th of this month. The detailed organizational rules have been submitted to the Municipal Council for resolution.

Recruitment of Labor; Allocation of Flour

Due to the tight municipal finances, the estimated budget for the first phase of dredging the six rivers this year will not exceed 300 million yuan. According to estimates by experts from the Public Works Bureau, this project will require 800,000 workdays and the removal of 400,000 cubic feet of sludge. The following methods for recruiting labor have been decided: (1) When recruiting labor, all male residents in the relevant areas between the ages of 20 and 45 are obligated to participate. Citizens who participate in the work will receive flour from the Executive Yuan, at a rate of two catties per person per day. (2) In accordance with the Labor Service Law of the Ministry of the Interior, those who do not wish to work may hire someone to replace them, and the flour from the Executive Yuan will be received by the substitute worker. (3) Those who participate in river dredging will receive wages from the municipal government and flour from the Executive Yuan. The above three methods will be carefully considered by the bureau before a final decision is made.

After the meeting, Mayor Wu told reporters that the purpose of the joint meeting of the Party, government, and military was purely to connect the feelings between the Party and the government, report on the progress of their work, conduct mutual reviews, and eliminate barriers to improve work efficiency.

During the meeting, Mayor Wu first reported on the vendor incident in this city and the current work of banning shantytowns, saying that the ban on shantytowns is limited to those newly built but not yet completed in the Jianxian District, which is to take into account the interests of the majority of the people. In addition, Mayor Wu attached great importance to the economic problems of this city, saying that the severity of the industrial and commercial crisis lies in high interest rates and the dumping of foreign goods. He said a decision has been made to increase industrial loans to eliminate high interest rates. Regarding the problem of the flooding of foreign goods, he said the central government has concrete restrictions.

Police Chief Xuan Tiewu reported on the handling of the vendor incident, saying that the police bureau had indeed done its best to maintain calm and patience.

Director Fang of the Municipal Party Department emphasized that although the vendor chaos has passed, it is necessary to strengthen local prevention work in the future.

It was reported that several proposals from the Municipal Party Department were passed at yesterday's meeting, including: (1) Strengthening the implementation of relief work in this city, expanding relief homes, establishing more porridge distribution points, and launching donations of winter clothing from all walks of life. (2) In accordance with President Song's instructions, launching large-scale production loans to restore the city's factories and develop industry and commerce. On the 10th of this month, President Song convened a meeting of the city's financial sector, proposing a method for lending funds to legitimate production enterprises. It was suggested that the Joint Treasury be requested to quickly establish a temporary review committee for production enterprise loans, relax the loan standards and the scope of collateral, simplify loan procedures, and reduce interest rates. (3) Increasing the number of national schools and increasing the salaries of elementary school teachers. Mayor Wu expressed great agreement in principle, but said that the city government's finances are currently difficult, and it is difficult to implement for the time being. (4) Building the Shanghai Zhongshan Hall and raising funds from all walks of life. (5) Quickly implementing the two-five rent reduction policy.

### Mediation of Labor-Management Disputes - Working Environment Needs Improvement - Small Room, Many People, Loud Arguments - Very Similar to "Having Tea and Talking"

[Our Paper's Report] The Mediation Section of the Social Bureau convened a departmental meeting at 5:00 PM yesterday to review the experience of mediating labor-management disputes and to seek technical improvements. In past mediation work, the following difficulties were often encountered: (1) During the mediation of disputes, the employer's representatives often deliberately failed to attend, preventing the work from being completed quickly. (2) During the mediation process, some workers had an uncooperative attitude, making it difficult for the mediators to handle. (3) The room was small, and there were many people. The room was noisy during mediation, and the order was chaotic. Most people held cigarettes and argued loudly, a situation very similar to "having tea and talking." From the reporter's personal observation: all the mediators were able to be patient and calm, fulfilling their responsibilities and demonstrating commendable service. However, the working environment must be improved.

### Cause of Arsenal Explosion - Not Believed to Be Due to Any Malicious Intent - Fugitives to Be Placed on Wanted List

[Our Paper's Report] The results of joint interrogations of transportation soldiers, warehouse soldiers, and wounded soldiers in the Jiangwan arsenal explosion case, conducted over several days by Director Yang of the Ordnance Department, Director Ling of the Ministry of National Defense, Commissioner Lei, Commander Fu of the First Supply Zone, and Director Yan of the Garrison Headquarters, still suggest that the cause of the accident was not due to any malicious intent. The testimony of all the interrogated soldiers was largely the same, stating that after they had finished unloading the grenades that day, they had boarded the truck to prepare to leave. At that time, only the escort squad leader from the Zhejiang Hongying Bureau and one guard soldier were left in the warehouse when a sudden explosion was heard, and they hastily fled for their lives. The fact that there were two bodies next to the truck lent credence to this account. As for the missing Deputy Warehouse Chief Wang Renxian and storekeeper Wu Rubiao, it is not believed that they had any other conspiracy, as they were both old employees with reliable backgrounds and years of service, and neither of their families had disappeared. Therefore, it is likely that they fled in fear of punishment, and the authorities will place them on the wanted list. Excavation is continuing at the site of the accident, and no new discoveries have been made. After a roll call of the Supply Zone soldiers, it is now known that two soldiers remain missing and their fate is unknown.

### Reader Consultation - Legal Questions

(1) Meddling

Cao Yuqun asks: My girlfriend, Miss Jia, is thirty-five years old and unmarried. A month ago, her father asked her for a private seal, and the next day, an engagement announcement bearing her name and that of Mr. Yi was published in the newspaper. Because she did not give her prior consent, she naturally cannot recognize this engagement. Please advise: (1) If Miss Jia does not deny it, will it be considered tacit consent, according to the law? (2) What is the deadline and method for denial? (3) Is it legal for Miss Jia to get engaged to Mr. Bing herself? Will Mr. Bing be guilty of interfering with a family? (4) Does the current law require parental consent for engagement, and how many people must participate in the ceremony? (5) Is it legal if a lawyer certifies it?

[Lawyer Zhu Ya Kui answers] (1) If Miss Jia does not deny it, it will naturally be considered consent; (2) There is no regulation; (3) According to Article 972 of the Civil Code, marriage should be determined by the man and woman themselves. If Miss Jia is an adult and engages herself to Mr. Bing, it is of course legal, and Mr. Bing does not constitute interference with a family; (4) According to Article 975 of the Civil Code, the engagement of unmarried men and women who are not of age should have the consent of their legal representative. There are no regulations regarding the ceremony; (5) Yes.

(2) House Rent Increase

Zhang Shenchao asks: My family lives in Pudong. Eighteen years ago, due to trouble in the clan, my late father moved out of the ancestral house and rented a house to live in, and had a lease agreement with landlord Mr. Jia. Later, the war broke out, and my late father could not bear the burden of the rent, and wanted to move back to the old house to live in. At that time, landlord Mr. Jia happened to be fleeing and was not home to take care of the house, so they discussed reducing the rent in exchange for taking care of the house. In May of the 33rd year of the Republic, my late father passed away. The landlord suddenly expressed an intention to increase the rent, claiming that starting from this year, the monthly rent would be five dou of rice. I am unable to bear this burden. I specifically want to know what to do legally. [Lawyer Zhu Ya Kui answers] The standard for rent increase should be determined according to the circumstances of each locality. In this case, it is better to negotiate with the lessor, otherwise, request a ruling from the local court.

### Production Loans - Conditions Can Be Relaxed - To Allow Production to Recover - Talk by Mr. Huo Baoshu of the Loan Review Committee

[Our Paper's Report] Yesterday, our reporter interviewed Mr. Huo Baoshu, the newly appointed chairman of the Provisional Review Committee for Production Academic Loans, and asked him about various issues related to production loans. He answered the questions in detail. The main points are as follows: The government's purpose in launching production loans this time is to address the current pathological state of industry and mining enterprises, providing emergency treatment to allow production enterprises to recover. Therefore, loans will focus on reducing production costs to facilitate production and sales. The committee has drafted a preliminary plan of principles for loan applications to be followed when applying for loans. In the future, after the draft is approved, any factory that applies for a loan and meets the requirements of the principles will be eligible to apply. He hopes that every applicant will make as much use as possible of its own inherent strength and not rely solely on loan assistance. At the same time, after obtaining a loan, they should not waste their inherent strength on matters outside their own business scope. According to his research, Chinese factories in general should actively improve their management systems. In terms of production costs, the current high interest rates account for a much larger percentage of the total labor costs than before the war. Therefore, high interest rates are one of the reasons for the sharp rise in production costs after the war. Factories that obtain loans and are able to reduce production costs by repaying old debts with the loan should also be considered. Therefore, the rigid requirement that past loans must be secured by raw materials and finished products may also be relaxed. The application method for this loan may be individual applications from each factory. After approval, each factory can entrust its original commercial banks and firms to carry the goods and allow the banks and firms to handle the transfer of mortgages with the Central Bank at any time. However, this does not conflict with the organization of small and medium-sized industrial and commercial loan syndicates. As for the various regulations on loans, he said that he would make full use of existing conventions and make necessary improvements. At the same time, the Loan Review Committee will hold three meetings a week, which will help to shorten the time from application to issuance of loans, which is believed to be shorter than before. As for the total amount of loans, it is still being finalized, depending on the actual needs of each factory, and efforts will be made to supply them. However, he sincerely hopes that the loan proceeds will be fully used for production purposes.

In addition, Deputy Secretary-General Diao Minren of the Joint Treasury stated to reporters: Production loans are intended to support legitimate production enterprises. Therefore, those who obtain loans should make full use of the loans for production purposes and should not divert them to other uses. We are now waiting for the Loan Review Committee to convene a meeting next Monday to decide on the direction of progress. He said that loan applications submitted to the Joint Treasury in the past will also be submitted to the Review Committee for centralized processing. The loan interest rate will be slightly flexible depending on the situation of each factory, but the maximum will not exceed five points.

It is heard that the Provisional Review Committee for Production Loans will publicly invite the Taishi press next Monday after convening a meeting to report on the committee's future work direction.

### Rumors Subside - Gold, US Dollars, and Stocks Fall Together - Gold Price Falls to 3.1 Million - US Dollars Fall Below 6,000 Yuan - All Stocks Experience a Decline

[Our Paper's Report] Yesterday, as reported in the news that the International Monetary Fund will accept exchange rates from member countries next week, still based on official rates, people's hopes were slightly dampened. In addition, the Central Bank suppressed the prices, causing them to fall back. The opening price in the morning was still around 3.27 million, but it was forced to retreat after opening, and many people closed their positions to take profits, retreating to within 3.2 million. However, there were still some buyers, and it soon rose back to the opening line. The Central Bank then distributed 100 bars at a price of 3.25 million, which started the downward trend. In addition, the Central Bank controlled the market, and buyers' psychology wavered. The selling trend strengthened, and after 10:00 AM, the Central Bank retreated again. Near noon, it broke into the 3.1 million mark, and the price gradually stabilized after seeing a low price of 3.08 million. At noon, it struggled above 3.13 million. The afternoon happened to be Saturday, and there was not much trading. As a result, it closed 120,000 yuan lower than the previous day. Ornamental gold also retreated to 330,000 yuan. Fine silver and silver dollars were flat. The unofficial exchange rate was flat. The interest rate was between 1.2 and 1.5 jiao. The foreign exchange market was extremely chaotic. The US dollar was still around 6,300 yuan in the early morning, but later, due to the fall in gold prices, buyers were slightly hesitant. At noon, the buying price fell to 5,800 yuan and the selling price was 6,000 yuan. There was not much change in the afternoon due to Saturday. As a result, it closed 400 yuan lower than the previous day. The Hong Kong dollar had risen to over 1,300 yuan at the beginning of the session, but it fell back by hundreds of yuan following the gold market. As a result, it closed 150 yuan lower than the previous day. The Hong Kong exchange rate fell to 75 yuan for telegraphic transfers yesterday. High prices had traded at 1,300 yuan, but later it was around 1,200 yuan. The British exchange rate was 19,200 yuan, and the Indian exchange rate was 1,460 yuan. Transactions were still not active.

Government bonds fluctuated yesterday. The performance of each bond was mixed. The A Bonds opened at 1,360 yuan in the morning. 360 rooms were sold, and 533 rooms and 604 rooms were advanced. The high price did not exceed 1,400 yuan, and the low price was only 1,320 yuan. In the end, it hovered between 1,350 yuan and 1,370 yuan. As a result, it closed 50 yuan lower than the previous day. The B Bonds rose by 20 yuan, the D Bonds rose by 30 yuan, and the E Bonds were flat. The volume was over 2 million yuan.

Yesterday, Chinese stocks plunged sharply as most of the large yarn and flower houses came out to take profits. Near noon, small investors were miserably crushed. Xinyi and Daitong then followed Match and announced their limit down. The opening price in the morning was still above the previous closing price, but the opening of Diyong Yarn was extremely chaotic. It was difficult to decide on a price between 570 yuan and 590 yuan, so 580 yuan was used to discount the market price as the opening price. After the opening, No. 212 made great efforts to raise the price. In the extreme chaos, Diyong Yarn was raised again to over 600 yuan. Numbers 151, 197, and 232 sold at high prices, and the price fell back quickly. Numbers 212, 76, 44, 83, 91, 115, and 91 all advanced and still easily rebounded.

Match and Daitong were the first to hit their limit down. In addition, Numbers 229 and 198 vigorously sold Diyong Yarn. The market situation gradually went downstream in a daze. Near noon, small investors were miserably crushed. Numbers 229, 198, and 152 desperately sought No. 212, who suddenly came to sell. People's hearts were greatly shaken, and Xinyi also announced its limit down. The two Yong Yarn stocks both broke into the 500 yuan mark at the same time. The noon closing was slightly sideways. Compared with the previous closing, Yong Yarn and Xinyi also announced their limit down. The two Yong Yarn stocks both broke into the 500 yuan mark at the same time.

### The Central Bank Reiterates Its Gold Policy - Hoping People Will Not Easily Believe Rumors and Suffer

The Central Bank recently stated that the gold allocation is still being supplied in large quantities. The surge in prices in this city is actually caused by speculators who are creating trouble. The official side is still handling it according to the established policy and there has been no change at all. This kind of artificial influence will first strike speculators, secondly, the public will rush to buy and will also suffer, and thirdly, it will affect general commercial banks. Therefore, it is hoped that the general public will recognize that all rumors deliberately creating trouble are deliberately created by speculators and will not bring trouble upon themselves.

### Overseas Remittances Decreased Again Last Month - Smugglers Buy Up Large Amounts

[Our Paper's Report] According to estimates by relevant sources, the number of overseas remittances in November decreased again compared to October. The main reasons are: (1) The black market price of US dollars has soared, while the official price remains the same; (2) The number of smuggling activities in South China has not decreased. Today, there are often remittances from one place in the United States to another, mailed to Guangdong, and sold to smugglers at a price slightly lower than the black market price of US dollars. The official estimate of the monthly loss is as high as 10 million US dollars. According to statistics from the Bank of China, in the six months after the victory last year, monthly overseas remittances were as high as 5 million US dollars. Today, the situation has changed, and monthly remittances are only about 2 million US dollars, and there is a trend of decrease, which is worrying. It is also rumored that foreign banks in Hong Kong are attracting overseas remittances from China at high interest rates. The reporter asked a banking expert about this, who said it was untrue. Because the vast majority of remittances sent to South China are for family use and support, rather than for investment or speculation. In the past, a certain national bank established a branch in Guangzhou, intending to attract overseas remittances with higher interest rates, but the results were very unsatisfactory, which is proof of this.

As the White Yuan Winter Solstice is approaching, sales are becoming more active, and it rebounded by 23,000 yuan. Yin Yuan jumped by 34,000 yuan. Flour prices are rising secretly because of high prices in the interior and fewer arrivals. Bran also rose by 200 yuan, but sales are quite small. Soybean transactions are lively, and prices have risen by 3500 to 1,000 yuan. Broad beans remain stable. Red beans still lack rise and fall. Sesame seeds are scarce and showy. Cantonese are continuing to purchase, and the price has increased by 12,000 yuan. Raw peanuts are still active at high prices, while medium and low prices are still stagnant. The situation is still in a spiral. Soybean cake has transactions in Huitou, Taiwan, and Fujian, and prices are rising step by step, rising by 3400 yuan. The oil market supply and demand are still balanced, and there is little volatility. Raw oil was weak early in the day and firm in the afternoon, and the result was stable. High-quality soybean oil rose slightly by 12,000 yuan, while medium and low quality was fair. Sesame oil stores are fragrant and dry, and the price rose by 34,000 yuan.

### Loan for Industry and Commerce: Release of Funds Begins; Total Amount 16 Billion Yuan

The lending measures for the electrical machinery and silk weaving industries have been approved by the Four Banks Joint Treasury. The Bank of Communications and the Bank of China will begin lending on November 25th. The silk industry has already completed the loan application procedures and signed contracts with the two banks.

Only factories with ten or more machines can apply for loans from the Bank of Communications and the Bank of China, while those with fewer than ten machines can apply for loans from the Industrial and Commercial Loan Syndicate. There are more than 300 silk weaving factories with ten or more machines, totaling 5,500 machines, with a total loan amount of 16 billion yuan. The collateral for the silk weaving industry is raw materials and finished products, with finished products not exceeding 50%. The discount is calculated at 70% of the market price.

### Difficulty in Importing American Orders

[Reported by this newspaper] The issue of handling orders placed in the United States before November 17th has not yet been resolved. According to reliable sources, the quantity of these goods, including those already shipped and those with contracts already signed, is very large. If import is permitted, the Central Bank will have to provide a large amount of foreign exchange. Due to the significant implications, the matter has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for instructions. Furthermore, due to the large number of applicants and the lack of manpower in the Import Control Committee, delays are inevitable. It is also understood that the nature of these goods is very complex. For example, a major American radio company signed a contract with a Chinese company for the latter to sell 20,000 radios, but only 1,000 have been shipped to date. However, in the import regulations, radios are included in the list of quota imports, making it difficult to apply for import permits. It is reported that some goods with high import priority have already had their permits telexed and are awaiting completion of the relevant procedures.

### Business Community Seeks Lenient Treatment from the Government

As for the opinions of the importers, they believe that the government's move was not known to the business community in advance, so the orders did not meet the government's requirements. The fault does not lie with the merchants, so they hope that the government will grant special lenient treatment and allow import, especially for goods that have already arrived at the docks, so that they can be moved into warehouses immediately to avoid unnecessary losses.

### Developing Home Industries: City Bank Provides Loans; Over 140 Million Yuan Already Loaned Out

In order to assist the development of small-scale home industries in the city, the Shanghai City Bank specially began providing home industry loans in September of this year, with a total amount of 200 million yuan. Those with a fixed location and handicraft equipment, operating a normal small-scale home industry, and have joined the trade association can apply for a loan from the bank. The monthly interest rate is 5%, and the term is temporarily set at six months. The original maximum limit per household was 2 million yuan in national currency, but the Ministry of Finance stipulated that the maximum amount for small industrial and commercial loans should not exceed 500,000 yuan. Therefore, from October onwards, the maximum loan amount was revised to 500,000 yuan. As for collateral, in addition to using the industrial equipment as collateral, one or two reputable manufacturers must also be found as guarantors. It is also stipulated that each household is limited to one loan and cannot change its name to obtain multiple loans. It is learned that the applicants for this loan include those in the handmade cotton weaving industry, towel and blanket industry, wooden box industry, soap and candle industry, and weights and measures industry. As of now, the bank has loaned out a total of 140 million yuan, of which 75 million yuan is said to be still in the process of completing the guarantee and signing the contract.

### Bounced Check Problem: Account Holders Abuse Checks; Increasing Month by Month; Statistics of Bounced Checks for the Last Six Months

[Reported by this newspaper] Negotiable instruments are originally a symbol of credit, and their circulation and use depend entirely on credit. However, the number and amount of bounced checks at the city's clearing house have been increasing month by month. This also shows the extent to which general bank account holders in the city are abusing credit. Although the banking industry has recently issued measures to crack down on bounced checks, the trend of bounced checks has not diminished. According to a person in the banking industry, the economic downturn in the city's industrial and commercial circles is one of the reasons for the bounced checks. However, in recent years, newly established banks and firms, in order to attract business, often allow customers to open accounts with low deposits and even offer gifts to increase customer interest, all of which are sufficient to increase the number of bounced checks. The following is an excerpt of the total number of bounced checks and the total amount for each month in the city's clearing house for the last six months:

Month Number of Checks Amount

June 47,334 86,095,699,217.03

July 77,853 134,110,082,694.61

August 68,911 121,274,101,457.55

### National Silk Export Problem: Special Export Committee to be Formed; Government Provides Affordable Raw Silk and Rayon; and Bears Part of the Funding for Weaving Machines

[Reported by this newspaper] The problem of large-scale export of national silk was discussed by silk weaving industry representatives and Director Lin Fengbao of the Central Bank. A decision in principle has been made, and the details will be discussed tomorrow. It is planned that the Central Bank, the Central Trust of China, and the China Silk Corporation will jointly form a special export committee.

Silk Weaving Factories to Form a Company

The silk weaving factories will be responsible for forming a company. The government will provide affordable raw silk and rayon. The government will bear 100,000 to 200,000 yuan per weaving machine. The government's supply price of raw silk will be higher than the level of US$6.5 per dan, and the supply price of rayon per case will be far below 2.8 million yuan.

Three-Month Manufacturing Plan

The manufacturing plan will be in three-month periods. In the first period, it is planned to weave 78,500 pieces of silk, using 1,450 dan of raw silk and 2,300 cases of rayon. It is estimated that the foreign exchange earnings from exporting the finished products will be more than double that of exporting raw silk. The government hopes that the company can be responsible for its own profits and losses, but the silk weaving industry hopes that the government can provide assistance. This is the problem that remains to be solved. The inaugural meeting of the company has been scheduled for today.

### China to Organize Special Education Group to Lecture Throughout Japan and Guide Overseas Chinese to Love the Country and Obey the Law

[Reported by this newspaper in Nanjing on the 14th] According to a recent survey by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, the Chinese delegation to Japan reports that there are currently more than 29,200 overseas Chinese in Japan, of which 60% are Taiwanese who have been repatriated, totaling 18,000. Half of them were forcibly recruited from Taiwan to work in Japan during the war. After Japan surrendered in August last year, in addition to those sent back to Taiwan, there are still those who live in various parts of Japan and refuse to be sent back. Most of these people are young people around the age of 20, with complex backgrounds and bad habits. The delegation believes that although these young people and other Taiwanese residing in Japan have considerable assets and considerable knowledge and skills, they are very isolated from the situation in the motherland after 50 years of Japanese rule and should be guided to develop a spirit of loving the country and obeying the law. When Mr. Zhang Yuejun went to the United States and passed through Tokyo, he suggested that domestic educational institutions should be responsible for hiring 30 to 40 educational experts to organize a special education group to travel around Japan to give lectures for a period of three months. It is estimated that it can be successfully completed in about one year. The delegation believes that this suggestion is very valuable, as it can improve the status of overseas Chinese in Japan and build a bridge for good Sino-Japanese relations in the future. This suggestion has been forwarded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Ministry of Education for comments. It is reported that the Ministry of Education is considering it. It also advocates that the education group should be expanded and that specialists should be selected from various ministries and commissions and relevant agencies, and that prominent figures from the community should be invited to participate.

### Ministry of Education Recently Formulated University Guidance System: Guidance Departments to Continue to Exist

Three to fifteen professors will be hired as members. The guidance departments of each school will continue to exist. The main task of the guidance committee is to legislate regulations related to guidance, which will be formulated by the committee. The guidance department will be responsible for the implementation. This two-pronged approach should correct the past shortcomings of the separation of guidance from academic affairs and general affairs in various schools.

### The First and Second District National Education Research Association Held its Inaugural Meeting Yesterday

Chen Qingshi Attended and Delivered a Speech

[Reported by this newspaper] Public and private national primary schools in the first and second districts of the city held the inaugural meeting of the First and Second District National Education Research Association at the auditorium of the Municipal Gezhi Middle School on Guangxi Road at 2:00 p.m. yesterday (14th). More than 200 principals and teachers from Qianjiang, Minghui, Yangxin, Chengzhong, Dagang, Jinghai, Shizhong, Jinwei, Minde, Baogong, Shangzhi, Zhengzhong, Xiqu Mengxue, Huahua, Xinrong, Minsheng, Leyi, Demin, Shizhong, Shenlian, Jinde, and Yakai participated. Gao Erbo, Hua Zhicheng, Xing Dazhi, and Wang Weiqun served as the presidium. Chen Qingshi, the chief supervisor of the Education Bureau, Liu Xunmu, the section chief of the National Education Office, and Ma Jingxuan, the resident supervisor of the district, attended the meeting for guidance. After Gao Erbo reported on the preparations, Chen Qingshi delivered a speech, briefly saying: The center of education is teaching. All the facilities of the school, school buildings, and administrative systems are all to help the progress of teaching. If we use war as a metaphor for teaching, then the teacher is the frontline soldier. We know that those who are with children every day and who are sufficient to influence the physical and mental development of children are not education administrators, but all of you teachers. Chen also said that regarding guidance work, if the improvement of education in the city entirely relies on the strength of a few supervisors, I think it is not enough. We need you all to take the initiative to study, and I hope that every principal can spend 50% of their time doing guidance work, and I hope that the principal's position will be full-time and the administrative procedures will be simplified. Liu Xunmu and Ma Jingxuan delivered speeches in turn. Finally, the presidium presented a draft of the research charter, which was amended and passed, and Gao Erbo was publicly elected as the director of the research association.

### Qingdao in a State of Hibernation – The Continued Existence of "Confiscation" and Warfare – Damages Qingdao's Industry, Commerce, and Culture

— Eleventh Day Airmail News Report – Our Newspaper's Qingdao Special Correspondent Hang Zhou

The sea breeze howls, and sand flies about. Qingdao, the "summer resort," is already in a state of hibernation. This winter is colder than ever before. Since the victory against Japan, Li Xianliang, who fought guerrillas in Laoshan, led his troops to take over the city, and it has been under siege by the Communist army ever since. In winter, the source of coal, which is essential for the lives of the people of the north, is very scarce. Although traces of this black stuff can still be found in the market, the price of more than 300,000 yuan per ton can only be a decoration in magnificent mansions, and ordinary citizens have no such blessing. On December 8, after a night of fierce winds, more than 200 of the 80,000 refugees fainted from cold and starvation. This is just a "small" tragedy, leaving an indelible stain on beautiful Qingdao, which should be the many ugly dramas performed by the "receivers." Guo Zhongkui, head of the Lu Yu Jin District Receiving and Investigation Team, made the following statement: "Qingdao's receiving corruption is the worst in the country!"

### Visiting Mayor Li, He Says: It's Hard to be in Charge

Li Xianliang is the current mayor of Qingdao. Before the Anti-Japanese War, he was the director of the Qingdao Special City Party Headquarters. During the guerrilla warfare in Laoshan, he served as acting mayor. In that era, he worked hard. He shared the joys and sorrows with all the comrades who fought guerrillas, risking their lives. After the victory, he was officially appointed as the mayor of Qingdao, took his luggage and took office. Now, he lives in the luxurious former Japanese consulate. After the reporter arrived in Qingdao, he went to visit him. I was received in an exquisite reception room. The sofas and spring chairs were covered in solid-colored blue velvet, pleasing to the eye. The gentle warmth and colorful curtains separated the frozen world outside. Mayor Li was wearing a spring outfit and talked about some issues with a smile. That day happened to be the day that US House Naval Committee member Isaac and five others left Qingdao for Tianjin. He first talked about the reception of foreign guests, saying: "Qingdao is an international city, and just the reception of foreign guests is enough to take up my mind. Foreigners pay great attention to the first impression. If you use Chinese food to entertain them, you must leave them with a very beautiful impression of Chinese flavor. Therefore, the freshness of the dishes and wine, and the exquisiteness of the cups and plates, are extremely important." He mentioned the banquet hosted by the Central Naval Training Group for the US congressmen last night: "They were obviously the first time they tasted Chinese flavor and praised it loudly, but I still feel a little uncomfortable today after drinking those wines."

The reporter said: "It is indeed not easy for Mayor Li to maintain the situation in Qingdao in the past year!"

He smiled very gracefully: "But some people who don't understand me are attacking me fiercely. Things in China are often like this: it's hard to be in charge! For example, about the reception, some of my subordinates have done wrong things, and it's all counted on my head!" Because of this matter, he made a special trip to Nanjing, and after returning, he inspected various places, seeming to have the determination to actively rectify the municipal administration. But he said to others with emotion: "Everyone under my hand has relationships, who should I deal with?"

### Qingdao's Receiving Corruption is the Worst in the Country – But Only Eight Cases Have Been Transferred to the Court

A few days later, I met Mr. Jiang Kexun, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, in the reception room of the Municipal Government. He criticized Mr. Guo's remarks as follows: "There are two questions here: First, what is the extent of national corruption and receiving fraud? Second, what is the extent of Qingdao's receiving fraud? Mr. Guo did not really handle the national receiving investigation, so it is difficult to make a comparison. Furthermore, since Qingdao's receiving fraud is the worst in the country, but only eight receiving fraud cases have been transferred to the court..." The implication seemed to be that it did not quite match the four words "worst in the country." Regarding these eight cases, I made a special trip to the local court to inquire, and five of them have already been prosecuted, and three are still under close investigation.

The targets of the five prosecuted cases are: (1) Li Dawu, Section Chief of the First Printing and Dyeing Factory of the China Textile Qingdao Branch, and clerk Xu Yanpei. (2) Lu Guangen, member of the Qingdao Municipal Government and Director-Secretary of the Public Business Management Committee, and Wang Zijing, a member of the committee. (3) Zhu Xiancai, receiving commissioner of the Economic Department's special commissioner office. (4) Guan Jinghai, clerk of the Real Estate Group of the Central Trust Bureau. (5) Ma Xijun, member of the Qingdao City Party Committee and member of the Party and Government Receiving Committee. The targets of the three cases still under investigation are: (1) Zhang Leigu, member of the National Senate. (2) Qiu Ruiji, member of the City Party Committee. (3) Sun Zhenyou, an employee of the Municipal Government.

Most of the Involved in Corruption Cases are Lower-Level People

Among them, the most sensational is the case of Zhang Leigu. In the mouths of ordinary citizens, Zhang Leigu is: "One of the three giants of Qingdao's receiving." There are many rumors about his "stealing dogs and changing days" tactics. He is now detained in the local court and is not allowed to meet any guests. The court seems to be particularly serious in handling this case. Chief Prosecutor Ding Shuke told reporters: "The big one can be prosecuted in two weeks."

"I don't think Director Guo said that casually." When the reporter interviewed Yang Changdi, Dean of the Second Branch of the Shandong Higher Court, and mentioned the certainty of Guo Zhongkui's remarks, Yang said: "As for those who commit corruption, most of them are probably middle and lower-level people. I didn't see what the receiving situation was like in Qingdao at the time, but what I know is that most of the personnel used at the time were "taken locally." If the superiors do not strictly prevent and stop the occurrence of corruption, or even tacitly allow it, the situation will be out of control." He then talked about the corruption of the previous political atmosphere: "The environment often forces the creation of corrupt phenomena. In a prosperous city like Qingdao, if officials don't take cars, don't wear suits and leather shoes, and don't have various luxurious enjoyment, it seems that they can't see people and are considered useless. When many people already have that kind of enjoyment, it is almost impossible for a few people to avoid it and want to change." He had just returned from Jinan, and he said that Jinan was much simpler than Qingdao, so the receiving situation in Jinan was also better. He also said: "There are only two types of officials now: one is an actor, and the other is someone with other purposes. There is no third type. Like a judge's income in the court, it is only enough for a family to eat cornbread. These people are all actors. We can only maintain it with personal feelings. Otherwise, a judge who goes out to hang a sign as a lawyer, the income from accepting a case is enough to exceed a year's salary as a judge." During the week that the reporter came to Qingdao, in order to find a house, he discovered some of the city's "secrets" regarding housing issues. I can almost say this: "Qingdao's handling of enemy and puppet housing is also the first in China"! In Shanghai, I know that there have been some "powerful" people illegally occupying houses, but it has always been considered illegal. However, in Qingdao, all occupiers are recognized, which invisibly encourages the atmosphere of occupation. An official from the Enemy and Puppet Industry Processing Bureau said it well: "As long as the people living in the house pay the rent, the government will have income, who lives there? It's the same anyway." As a result, one person in Qingdao occupies more than a dozen houses, and at the same time, many people can't find a place to live. "Housing shortage"! "Housing shortage"! The parrot with a crooked mouth is calling like this. There is a Housing Assessment and Allocation Committee, which is an institution to deal with applicants, but it is famous in name only. There is still no clear list in the committee, and whether those houses have been processed or those houses have been processed is like a riddle. One gentleman finally got allocated a house, but someone was already living there. When he asked them to "move," they stretched out their hands and said, "Bring money"! As a result, this gentleman who couldn't afford the "moving fee" had to live in a hotel.

The Most Dangerous Period Has Passed – Vigilance Has Not Been Relaxed

The most dangerous period for Qingdao militarily has passed. The most dangerous time was this summer. At that time, the Communist army had attacked Qingdao's water source, and the city's military strength was weak and in jeopardy, but the Communist army did not dare to take advantage of the situation. Liao Zhipan, Deputy Commander of the Second Appeasement District of the Xuzhou Appeasement Office and Commander of the Qingdao Garrison, commanded some security teams and struggled to overcome this crisis. Now, the periphery is gradually expanding. The Jiaoji Railway is a major artery in Shandong. With the railway bureau's rush repairs, traffic can be restored. Once this road is open, Qingdao's state of being blocked can be declared lifted.

However, the Communist army, which has abandoned peace talks, is preparing new military actions. On both sides of the Jiaoji Railway, especially in the southern region, with Linyi as the center, a considerable number of Communist troops are gathered, and they may launch a double-strike against the cities along the Jiaoji Line at any time, in order to expand their military division. Xia Chuzhong, Commander-in-Chief of the 20th Army Group, who is responsible for the security of the Jiaoji Line, came to Qingdao a few days ago and said to reporters: "The National Army abides by the ceasefire order and will never take the initiative to attack, but if the Communist army invades me, then I will definitely have a way to deal with it." Therefore, as far as Qingdao is concerned, it is still in a state of vigilance and fear at this moment. "Sudden checks on household registrations" are often held. In addition to the midnight curfew that has already been implemented, a maritime curfew has also been implemented since December 5, prohibiting all civilian ships from entering and leaving.

The Conscription Quota is 1,000 – To Be Completed Within the Year

The conscription quota for Qingdao this year is 1,000. Due to various unexpected reasons, only more than 600 have been conscripted so far. Conscription is carried out in accordance with the central laws and regulations. The mayor draws 1,000 names from the number of eligible young men in the city. Fearing that there would be incidents of evasion, the baojia chiefs took ropes to the homes of each drawn young man on the night the list was announced and told them: "You should fulfill your most glorious duty!" Naturally, there was some disturbance. And the illegal phenomenon of some baojia chiefs taking the opportunity to buy and sell top alleys has also been frequently discovered in Qingdao. It is said that the remaining 300 or so who have not yet been conscripted will be completed within this year.

Nine Out of Ten Public and Private Factories Have Not Yet Resumed Operations

The continued existence of "confiscation" and warfare is a great harm to Qingdao's industry, commerce, and culture. According to statistics, there were more than 4,000 public and private factories of all sizes in Qingdao during the enemy and puppet period, but less than one-tenth of them have resumed operations. And the market situation is even more bleak. Most of the goods come from Shanghai, plus a considerable freight fee. How can the small citizens, whose income is lower than that of Shanghai, afford to buy them, except for those who make a fortune by "confiscating" and some special people? In the streets, you can see that the paint on the facades of large and small stores has faded, just as desolate as the fallen leaves in front of them!

Qingdao Only Has a Beautiful Exterior – Like a "Flexible Daughter"

Surrounded by the sea on three sides and mountains on one side, Qingdao only has its beautiful appearance. Someone once said: "There is no culture here." When you walk into a bookstore, all the books come from Shanghai, and 90% of these books are of a yellow nature. No decent magazine is published locally. The content of the several daily newspapers that represent culture is poor and boring. The "special dispatches" of some newspapers are completely copied from Shanghai newspapers, word for word.

I walked alone on the coast of the Yellow Sea, quietly passing by those bathing beaches. I came to the Qianhai Boardwalk at the end of Zhongshan Road. I stood and watched, the sea breeze howling and the waves surging. This is known as one of the best naval bases in the Far East, but China's new navy is still in its infancy. At this moment, American sailors are going ashore in batches, and jeeps are speeding through the deserted asphalt roads. Dance halls, bars, and cafes are only lively during the time when American sailors go ashore. Girls in strange clothes are hugging one sailor after another. So, I thought of giving Qingdao an appropriate adjective, calling it: a "flexible daughter"! (December 11, on a freezing night in Qingdao)

### The Great Tainan Earthquake: A Brief Account of Disaster Relief

— Airmail Dispatch from the 9th, by our Correspondent in Taiwan, Yang Yu

At 6:45 AM on the 5th of this month, a violent earthquake occurred in Sinhua and Yongkang, approximately eight kilometers northeast of Tainan City. The maximum amplitude exceeded one centimeter, with the overall tremor lasting for ten minutes. The perceived duration for people was over a minute. In an instant, houses collapsed, railways and bridges were destroyed, and more than three hundred and seventy people were killed or injured, all due to being crushed by collapsing buildings. Heartbreaking cries filled the air, resembling a scene of hell on earth!

The epicenter was a triangular area encompassing Yongkang, Xinshi, and Sinhua, with Sinhua being the most severely affected. In the epicenter area, the ground suddenly cracked open in several places, with the land either rising or sinking by as much as two meters. Nearby roads, sugarcane fields, and peanut farms saw dozens of places where black sand and spring water erupted, with the longest stretch reaching twenty kilometers.

The railway between Tainan City and Sinhua suffered significant damage. Of the total length of eleven kilometers, eight kilometers were severely impacted by the earthquake, with rails being bent or broken. Simultaneously, two railway bridges were cracked, disrupting traffic. After emergency repairs by railway workers, and because the line was a double track, trains were able to pass through normally by 5:00 PM that evening. The main water supply line for Tainan City (buried between Xinshi and Sinhua) was also cracked in four places due to the earthquake, causing a water outage in Tainan City. Repairs are expected to take a week. Fortunately, the Jianan Irrigation System was undamaged, so there was no impact on agricultural irrigation, which is a blessing amidst misfortune. In recent days, provincial authorities have dispatched personnel to the disaster area to investigate the situation in detail, provide instructions on relief efforts, distribute supplies, and comfort the affected people. The Taiwan branch of the National Relief Commission has also sent doctors with medicine to the disaster areas to treat the injured.

The most severe earthquake in Taiwan occurred on the morning of the 21st of the Republic of China, at 10:02 AM, in the Hsinchu and Taichung area, resulting in 15,001 deaths and injuries, and 55,000 collapsed houses. The second most severe earthquake occurred on the morning of December 17th, 1930, at 4:19 AM, in Chiayi, resulting in 1,002 deaths and injuries, and over 15,000 collapsed houses. In addition to significant landslides, the severity of this Tainan earthquake can be said to be second only to these two major earthquakes.

### The Difficult Journey of Miss Cotton

— Airmail Dispatch from Zhengzhou on the 6th, by our Correspondent in Zhengzhou, Fan Shiqin

Why was Zhengzhou a famous commercial port before the war? I've lived in Zhengzhou for a year and haven't figured it out. Is it because the magnificent Lunghai Garden was bombed into ruins? Is it because the section of the Pinghan Railway going north was leveled by the "Road Demolition Army"? Is it because the Huayuankou breach hasn't been filled yet? Or has some bigwig passed away? Or has some Red Little Group grown old? I still haven't found an answer. Recently, because I needed to add a cotton quilt, I had to pay attention to cotton. So, I often asked the cotton merchants at the stalls and the cotton transporters on the carts, and then I realized how important cotton is to Zhengzhou, and that there is a Zhengzhou only when there is Miss Cotton.

All Sectors are Busy for Cotton

A few days ago, cotton in Zhengzhou was 2,500 yuan per catty, but it has now risen to 3,000 yuan. It is said that recently is the time when cotton is coming on the market, and some big merchants from Shanghai have already arrived in Zhengzhou to purchase cotton. Trains are busy transporting cotton and medicine, and banks are busy handling cotton mortgage exchanges. The transportation and financial sectors of a market are all busy for this cotton. This cotton is becoming popular in this market. Anyang is a cotton-producing area. Some time ago, 70% of the cotton-producing area was in the hands of the Communist army, but recently those areas have been recovered. It is said that Anyang produces 300,000 dan of cotton this year. During the War of Resistance, we were in northern Hubei. The largest production in northern Hubei was cotton. At that time, except for the occupied areas, the first place in cotton production in the country was the Northwest, and the first place in the Northwest was northern Hubei. The Ministry of Economic Affairs set up many institutions to absorb the cotton of northern Hubei, and many officials and merchants became rich and successful because of this. In fact, the entire cotton production of northern Hubei was less than 300,000 dan. So, it is surprising that Anyang alone produces 300,000 dan of cotton. When the Communist army occupied the vicinity of Anyang, people were still under their control, and cotton was no exception. At that time, they only paid 50 or 60 yuan of "Anti-Japanese Currency" to buy a catty of cotton from the people, saying that the people were willing to let the cotton rot on the ground, betting on a year of hard work that was not compensated. After those cotton-producing areas were recovered, the price of cotton in Anyang suddenly fell from 2,000 yuan per catty to 1,500 yuan.

Cotton Merchants' Business Acumen

Now, some cotton merchants are flocking to Anyang to purchase cotton, this is business acumen. Business acumen is one thing, and making money is another. According to those cotton merchants, you must bring cash to Anyang to purchase cotton, because there is no bank in Anyang, so you must have some adventurous spirit. Cotton merchants regard cotton as business acumen, while the local authorities in Anyang regard cotton merchants as business acumen. An additional levy of more than one million yuan is imposed on a car of cotton worth 40 million yuan. An Anyang cotton packing factory is only ten miles away from the Communist army and has no way to start work, so a carload that can carry 30 tons can only carry 16 tons of cotton. At the same time, because the packaging is not tight, 2% will leak on the way, and it is necessary to pay 150,000 yuan for insurance per car. In the past, 10,000 yuan of capital could buy 30 tons of cotton, but now 200,000 yuan can only buy 165 catties. Therefore, now if you want to dare to buy 30 tons of cotton, you need more than 73 million yuan, and ordinary merchants do not have such a large amount of funds. So, purchasing cotton in Anyang is also not an easy business.

A Surge in the Market

However, the Zhengzhou market is stimulated by cotton. Several banks and money shops are doing a lot of cotton mortgage exchanges. Most of the cotton coming from Anyang is transported to Hankou. A cotton household can apply for a mortgage exchange of 300 million yuan at the Bank of Communications in Zhengzhou. The interest rate is 4.5%, but the term is only 15 days. When it arrives in Hankou, you can apply for another mortgage exchange. The interest rate is 5%. If there is a factory in Hankou, the term can be extended to 45 days. This is a preferential treatment for manufacturers. Currently, only 100,000 dan of cotton passes through Zhengzhou, which is still far from the 3 million dan of cotton that passed through before the war. These 100,000 dan of cotton have stimulated the Zhengzhou market into a surge. If 3 million dan of cotton poured in like before the war, then Zhengzhou would become a veritable commercial port. "There is a Zhengzhou only when there is Miss Cotton" is indeed a well-deserved reputation.

China Textile Company Buys Cotton

The China Textile Company recently purchased 300,000 dan of cotton in the Northwest, but because it cannot get on the trains of the Longhai Railway, it is still stranded in Xi'an and often has "difficult cotton." Although someone is purchasing cotton in the Lingbao area, how to get it here is still a problem. The difficulty of Miss Cotton's journey is not only about getting on the train, but also because there is no packing lady (packing factory) to dress her up. Originally, there were six packing ladies in Henan. One packing lady in Anyang is in the situation mentioned above and is not working. The two packing ladies in Lingbao have no way to dress her up because Miss Cotton's arrival is uncertain. The remaining three packing ladies are in Zhengzhou. Two were taken away by the enemy, and one was taken over by a troop to be used as a flour grinder. They are now requesting the Ministry of National Defense to return it, which is probably no problem.

To restore the Zhengzhou market, we must first restore the Zhengzhou cotton market, and make it have 3 million dan of cotton gathered in Zhengzhou like before the war. Of course, there are many difficulties. The main reason is that the cotton fields have been reduced a lot because the enemy controlled cotton in the past. In the past year or so, it is naturally impossible to recover all at once. Yu Feng and Shenxin Yarn Factory have decided to resume production here, but it cannot be completed in a short time. The factory buildings must be rebuilt, and the machines are probably still in the United States. In addition, there are many problems with transportation. However, everyone is looking forward to Zhengzhou returning to its pre-war prosperity, so they are looking forward to Miss Cotton coming to Zhengzhou to revitalize the market.

### The Third New Film from China Electric Company, "Distant Love"

— Xiao Chen

After the screening of "Family of Loyalty" and "Horror in the World", China Electric Company’s Second Studio now presents us with its third film, "Distant Love". The subject matter of this film is very realistic, and its theme is: to portray an ideal housewife who, under the influence of reality, steps into society.

Synopsis: Professor Xiao Yuanxi's speech at the Youth Hall angered his lover, Zhu Manli, leading to their break-up. He then vowed to create an ideal wife. That evening, Xiao suddenly noticed that the maid, A Zhen, was secretly reading a book. He decided to use A Zhen as the subject of his experiment, teaching her daily about social skills, attitude, and etiquette. A Zhen's knowledge and insights improved rapidly. When the January 28th Incident of the Shanghai War broke out, A Zhen joined the nursing corps because her father and brothers were brutally murdered by Japanese invaders, and served wounded soldiers fighting against Japan. One day, Zhen happened to be walking with Li Lianqun, which Xiao witnessed, greatly displeasing him. He instructed A Zhen not to continue this work, which left Zhen feeling disappointed. By the eve of the July 7th Incident, Xiao became even more vigilant in preventing Zhen from participating in anti-Japanese activities. However, the full-scale outbreak of the August 13th War moved Zhen deeply, and she resolutely went out to participate in the war effort. Coincidentally, Xiao was invited by a friend to leave Shanghai for Hankou. As the National Army retreated westward, he telegraphed Zhen, urging her to come to Hankou. Zhen then left her eldest child with Wu Yanan, took her youngest child, and left Shanghai on a refugee ship. Unexpectedly, the ship was bombed mid-journey, and her youngest child died tragically. This only strengthened Zhen's resolve to resist Japan. Xiao met Zhen and saw that she had become a soldier, which displeased him greatly, while Zhen was also disgusted with Xiao's decadent lifestyle. At that time, a female soldier named A Tang came to visit, and Zhen accompanied her to the war zone service troupe. Hearing this, Xiao wanted to bring Zhen back, but Zhen refused, leading to a final break-up. When Wuhan was abandoned, Xiao met Wu Yanan and learned that Zhen had joined the service troupe led by Li Lianqun. When Guilin was evacuated, Xiao met Wu again and went to the service troupe to find Zhen. Xiao pleaded for a renewed relationship, but Zhen said she would answer after the victory. After the victory, Zhen originally intended to reunite with Xiao, but suddenly realized Xiao's mistakes, leading to a heated debate. Zhen then left Xiao. Xiao ended up marrying Zhu Manli, and during the wedding he said that Zhen, after being transformed, had surpassed even himself.

Generally speaking, the plot is quite compact. The director of this film, Chen Liting, is known as a theoretical expert. Now that he has successfully filmed this work as he wished, the result can be foreseen. I happened to meet director Chen Liting at the Second Studio of "China Electric" a few days ago. I learned that the scene of the retreat from Guilin in the film was filmed in Wuxi, and more than 10,000 temporary extras were hired. This scene alone should have a "cherry on top" feel.

Now, this film will soon be screened at the "Imperial Palace". Only public opinion will be able to judge its success!

### Zhao Dan in "Distant Love"

### On the Rise and Fall of Kun Opera

— Xuan Lu

Kun Opera takes its name from its place of origin. However, it is not a type of local opera like Sichuan Opera, Chu Opera, Yue Opera, or Shanghai Opera. At the same time, the Kunqu music used to perform Kun Opera is also not a type of local music.

Our country's rhyming literature transformed from the Book of Songs to the Chu Ci, then to the Han and Wei yuefu, then to Tang poetry, and then to Song ci. Ci is a variant of poetry, so it is also called "poetry surplus." Song ci evolved into Yuan qu, which is actually a variant of ci, so qu is also called "ci surplus." Therefore, from the perspective of our country's literary history, qu inherits the essence of poetry and serves as the precursor to modern vernacular poetry and prose.

From a dramatic perspective, although there were canjunxi plays in the Tang Dynasty, their content is impossible to verify. Poetry and ci are works in which authors express personal emotions, and there is never an example of speaking on behalf of others. Qu, on the other hand, is a representative form, with arias and dialogue. Each play is divided into several acts and can be performed on the stage, making it a work of art enjoyed by the masses. Therefore, qu is the earliest form of drama in our country, and all later forms of drama originate from it.

However, although the qu lyrics of Yuan qu are still available today (for example, Zang Jinsu's Yuanqu Xuan is the easiest book to purchase), its musical tune has been lost. The Kunqu music that is passed down today is not the same as the old Yuan qu. However, it is closer to the ancient music, and the proper sounds of refined music still exist. The origin of Kunqu is described as follows:

Succeeding the Yuan was the Zhu Ming Dynasty. Since the Ming Dynasty restored the homeland with the Han people, expelled the Hu Yuan, and the literary and artistic aspects also changed the simple and straightforward style of the Yuan Dynasty, and admired rhetoric. However, the system of qu has become deeply rooted, and although the Ming people wanted to restore ancient ways, they could not get rid of its stereotypes. Thus, qu was divided into northern and southern styles. Zaju is called Northern Qu, and its system mostly imitates the works of Yuan people, with simple and unadorned words and vigorous rhythms. Chuanqi is called Southern Qu, and Gao Zecheng's Pipa Ji pioneered it. In the early Ming Dynasty, Jing Liu Bai Sha was written, and later authors created a magnificent view. Its style changed from the simple and straightforward style of the Yuan Dynasty to a beautiful and elegant style, and its rhythms were slow and gentle, which was the characteristic of a prosperous age.

However, whether it is Northern Qu or Southern Qu, if it is not accompanied by music, it is only a literary work, and has nothing to do with qu at all, let alone being called drama. Since it is called qu, it can not only be broadcast with wind and string instruments, but also be performed on stage, which is where it differs from poetry and ci.

During the mid-Ming Dynasty, although qu was divided into northern and southern factions in terms of system, its music and lyrics, that is, the performance method in music, varied from place to place. According to Xu Wenchang's Nanci Xulu, there were the Yiyang tune of Jiangxi, the Haiyan tune of Zhejiang, the Yuyao tune, and the Gaoyang tune of Hubei. It can be seen that although the qu lyrics were the same at that time, their singing methods varied from place to place. The chaotic situation can be imagined. During the Jiajing and Longqing period in the mid-Ming Dynasty, there was a music expert named Wei Liangfu in Kunshan, Jiangsu, who saw this situation and lived in seclusion, studying the ancient and modern musical temperaments to correct the rhythm as his own responsibility. After ten years of hard work, he invented a kind of water milled tune and wrote a medical book on musical temperament to pass on to the world. His disciple Liang Chenyu Bolong wrote Jiangdong Bai Shuqu and Huansha Ji Chuanqi, which restored Yang and greatly expanded it. Since the water milled tune came out, other tunes have been overwhelmed, and it has dominated the opera arena and dance pavilions until the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods of the Qing Dynasty, for three hundred years. In the history of music and drama in our country, it is a brilliant and bright flower, because the water milled tune deeply studies the joys and sorrows of the plot and the four tones of Yin and Yang of the word sound, and the fast and slow, rising and falling of its rhythms, without any sound that does not have a theoretical basis, to match the sound of the heavens, so it can be so popular and far-reaching. At that time, this tune was named Kunshan Tune because it came from Kunshan, and it was abbreviated as Kun Tune.

From this point of view, since Kun Tune can overwhelm other tunes and its popularity is so widespread, it cannot be regarded as local music. The Kun Opera performed with this music cannot be regarded as local drama. In the history of art in our country, it certainly has a national value and status.

However, why was the military tune so popular at that time, and why has it declined in recent times? The reason for this can also be briefly stated: The reason why Kun Opera is popular is that it has its characteristics: (1) The writing is beautiful and is praised by scholars. (2) The matching music matches the original sound of each word in the lyrics, so the tones of Yin and Yang, Qing and Zhuo are different. The music also changes accordingly. There are no lyrics in the world that have the same words, so there are absolutely no completely identical scores. (3) The pronunciation and intonation, whether in singing or in dialogue, are based on phonetics, and the words are correct and the sounds are round. (4) The performance posture maintains the legacy of Tang Dynasty dance, which is beautiful and elegant, symbolizing the good and peaceful attitude of the Chinese nation.

As for the reasons for the rise and fall of Kun Opera, the author believes that they are generally no more than the following reasons: (1) The rhetoric component is too heavy, and it is not easy for the public to appreciate. (2) The analysis of word sounds is too detailed, and when it encounters a long delay in sound, it is difficult to recognize. (3) Most of the composers are literati and scholars, who are good at writing but lack stage experience, so the arrangement and layout often cannot cater to the psychology of the audience. (4) The stage structure and the audience's understanding of music are different now and in the past, so the sound and appearance performances that were praised by people in the past are often incomprehensible to people today. Although Kun Opera is declining now, its advantages not only always exist, but are also imitated by other operas. It will not perish.

### Script

— He Dingji

"A Song to Remember" depicts the life of the Polish musician Chopin. It's very difficult to get the best evaluation of a biographical film because people familiar with Chopin's life will know that this film fails to truly represent Chopin's true personality. The screenwriter only took the outline of a certain part of his life's deeds. In the story, we praise the screenwriter's selection of materials. He doesn't focus on the characters in the story. Instead, by means of this outline, he praises a kind of spirit to move the audience.

From Chopin's childhood piano practice, the author only took a story to portray Chopin's soul, that is, when he and Professor Elsner looked out the window at the Russian cavalry team, he angrily hit the piano keys to show his protest to them. As an adult, he sneaked into Paris because he was unwilling to perform in front of the Russian "executioner." This is proof of his patriotism and his spirit of resistance to tyranny!

The screenwriter wrote Chopin as a captive of love, while George Sand was written as a jealous, bold, and selfish woman. If it weren't for this paragraph, then Chopin would not be sympathized with by the audience.

When Chopin saw the soil of his motherland again, he suddenly woke up from the maze of private feelings and rekindled his love for his country. He played the "Polonaise" everywhere and died of weakness! The spirit of this patriotic musician Chopin will last as long as the "Polonaise."

Although the actors in the film are well-matched, the other three main characters, except for Paul Muni, are not as perfect as ideal. They are only competent. Paul Muni is more prominent from beginning to end, especially when the publisher promised him to hold a concert in a few days and he was so happy that he fell down. Conner Zaelde is better in this "mad scene." The best thing is: traveling around to perform, decisive piano playing, and the sweat on his forehead became more and more numerous. This is the most successful.

### Good Shots

— Shi Xing

Watching the film "A Song to Remember" also made me feel like I was in the era of the 19th century, witnessing the tragedy of a national talented musician in the contradiction between love and responsibility.

Here are some of the best shots.

Chopin (as a child) was practicing the piano when he suddenly saw the scene of the Imperial Russian occupation army abusing Polish citizens outside the window. Then the elegant piano sound suddenly became a pounding sound of hitting the piano keys wildly. The director expressed his anger in the chaotic piano sounds like thousands of horses galloping.

Chopin played to entertain guests at a banquet in a certain nobleman's house. At the end of a piece, the guests asked to play again. Suddenly, the governor of Poland sent by the Tsar arrived. The earl rushed to greet him and asked Chopin to continue playing. Chopin was extremely angry and said, "I don't want to play in front of the Tsar's butcher." Then he walked out proudly.

Because it was difficult for Chopin to live in his hometown for a long time, he wanted to escape to Paris. Before leaving, his anti-enemy comrade and lover gave him a handful of Polish soil, wishing him not to forget his motherland.

Chopin followed his music teacher Professor Elsner to Paris, and was fortunate enough to be supported by the French romantic writer George Sand and the famous aristocrat Aster's family, and became famous in one fell swoop. Since then, he began to distance himself from his professor, forgetting his country and comrades, and plunged into George's arms - a peaceful and carefree world. George loved Chopin deeply, and in the communication with her parents, she concealed everything. Once, the professor went to Sand's house to visit Chopin. Sand refused the two to meet on the grounds that "I don't want to disturb him while he is working." The professor called out Chopin's name, who was playing the piano upstairs, and the piano sound stopped sadly, but soon continued. Chopin chose the former in the contradiction between leisure and hardship, and the professor returned in disappointment.

The Polish liberation movement suffered extreme hardships and setbacks. Countless comrades were arrested, and only money could be used to rescue them, and only Chopin's art could be exchanged for a lot of money. His old lover sneaked into Paris and transferred a bag of Polish soil to him. In the pain of contradiction, Chopin finally broke free from the shackles of love and went to various places in Europe to perform and raise money to repay the country, but his weak body eventually fell ill. On his deathbed, he said, "I seem to be going home." His dear teacher, lover, friends all surrounded him, except for George Sand, whom he hoped to meet but did not.

"The fascination of the mistress, the supervision of the good teacher, attacked from left and right, the suffering of the motherland, and the pain of oneself, afflicted inside and out, ended the moving deeds of the great musician Chopin's life."

### After Reading "Today's Chinese Playwrights"

— Du Xin from Linzhun

I have a few opinions on Naya's article "Today's Chinese Playwrights" published on October 7th:

(1) The article only mentions four playwrights of "Today's China", which is quite like the title of "Today's Chinese Playwrights" not only referring to these four, but only mentioning these four playwrights seems not to match the general title of "Today's Chinese Playwrights". The author Mr. Naya said: "At present, I will introduce and review the playwrights you are familiar with." The playwrights "you are familiar with" seem to be more than these four.

(2) I dare not casually express my "review" of Mr. Naya, such as "...In "Thunderstorm", Sifeng swore to her mother that she would be struck by lightning in the future. As a result, she did go, and she was struck by lightning and died. It can be said that this kind of wording that promotes superstition is his only mistake." The playwright used this technique to strengthen the tragic atmosphere, which is precisely where it is appropriate. It seems that it cannot be said out of context that he is: "A very backward fatalist who puts a character into fate." Regarding the "review" of Chen Baiwei, Mr. Naya said: "Lu Yantu's official lord seems a bit too much. The official says what, and that's what he says. He has forgotten the rights of the people." The writer's intention is to expose the incompetence and shamelessness of general corrupt officials. Of course, emphasis must be placed to achieve the purpose of playwriting. How can he say "a bit too much"?

(3) "Phoenix City" is a work by Wu Zuguang. Mr. Naya "introduced" it in Yuan Jun's work. In addition to "Small Town Story", Yuan Jun also has "Border Town Story", both of which are "towns". "Town" after "town" can easily confuse people. Maybe Mr. Naya remembered it wrong for a while. I think Mr. Naya will never "put Zhang's hat on Li's head".

The above three points, although the meaning is not elegant, I don't know whether Mr. Naya can accept it?

### "Unforgettable Tune" Doesn't Align with Chopin's Life

— Li Wenxun

After seeing "Unforgettable Tune," a friend softly said to me, "Tenderness makes me weep..."

Chopin was just like that. His name represented a piece of loving heart. In his contemplative eyes, one could see the piety of a believer, the sorrow of a dreamer, and the passion for the land. His dying voice was not so much like the final cry of a dying bird. He called out the names of Christ and the Holy Mother. That fervent voice could truly reach heaven. He kissed the cross with pale lips!

"I love God and people"! What sincere last words. He said, "Now I have arrived at the borders of happiness"!

The poet of the piano, his music possessed sorrow, romance, lyricism, and fantasy. His piano playing and his composing were both unparalleled. Pearl-like scales, sweet, tender, as gentle as tears, as clear as tears. His hands appeared slender, with delicate fingers and wrists, yet he could play intervals of a tenth. Those two hands covered a third of the keyboard, truly a wondrous sight, like a charming snake opening its red mouth to swallow a white rabbit. His wise eyes, the seductive lips of a woman, a large aquiline nose, and a Byronic collar around his neck—that was such a lovable poet. A lovable Polish man.

The voice of Chopin's soul is still important to people of our century, but formally, it has been obviously ignored. Program music has taken the art of the spiritual to mythology. Chopin neither preached nor painted, nor did he have the formality of self-cultivation and the theater. This is a kind of audible poem, like the fragrance of a rose in bloom, sharing common ground with Verlaine, Shelley, Keats, and others, but Chopin is always incomparable. He is special and also common. Special in his genius, and common in that he used his genius to express Poland. His music not only belongs to Poland but also speaks of the sorrow and aspirations of the Polish people. He wholeheartedly embraced Poland with the dignity and passion of humanity. He extremely detested boredom and vulgar souls. He suffered alone in his sweet human realm, feeling sorrow in his beautiful soul...

Chopin died, and a bouquet of flower-like sounds was extinguished. As for George Sand, she possessed the strength of a man, too strong a desire to conquer. She treated men like hotels, residing temporarily and moving on at any time, the same to Chopin as to Musset. According to her own explanation, it was "a mother's affection," acting as a mother, nanny, confidante, and caretaker, but her passions were as vigorous as her creations. The sentimental Chopin could not satisfy her. She needed a piece of music that was strong, like a tempest.

Regarding Chopin, the arrangement of "Unforgettable Tune" is somewhat inaccurate!

### Idle Talk of a New Expedition

— Ma Boliang

Iron Hoof and Blood Tears

Joan of Arc accepted religious sacrifice, and Joan accepted the disaster of love. They were both equally calm. Because of their calm, Joan's glance at the threshold, her final farewell to life, makes us feel a rare sorrow. The person walking to the execution ground sheds a little tear, shimmering brightly for a while, and is then killed. The music box is still singing.

There are stories like "Hate of a Maiden," and the suspense of "Spy Commando." Don't pursue ideals too much. I have long been tired of anti-Nazi films. I may forget Bobby Stevenson, the director of "Hate of a Maiden," but I cannot forget Robert Stevenson of "Iron Hoof and Blood Tears." "Jane Eyre" is his glorious milestone. He customarily uses his rounded techniques, deep close-ups, photographic lighting, and rich atmosphere to set off this love story. He helps the actors to act, letting their emotions flicker in the light and shadow, letting their strong eyes and numb lips speak a lifetime of words. The cast is thus even stronger. Paul Henreid has always been more at ease than Cornel Wilde. Mitchum’s cheeks are too wide; his profile is very good. Alan Ladd has few scenes, so he doesn't count. Thomas Mitchell, Wright Krieg, and Melvyn Douglas are famous supporting actors, skilled and naturally competent.

If we are to tremble with fear of death from now on, we had better read the words of Mrs. Matheson; "The idea of death should stimulate us to devote our lives to the noblest purposes, giving the highest value to every moment that composes it." This is the spirit of Joan of Arc and Joan.

Iron Window Lovebirds

The world is so big, everyone flies outward, with endless realms to fly through and endless experiences to live through. "Iron Window Lovebirds" tells the story of three people flying outward, paying the price of struggle for each stop. Danny mistakenly goes astray, and although he regrets it, he has his own road of struggle ahead. Will he turn back? Yes, when he is tired of flying, he may come to see this couple in distress, but he will never be satisfied with this ordinary life. He is not a simple good person. Danny is the only colorful character in this ordinary subject matter. Richard Whorf brings him to life. He saves his good friend and also saves the film. Thus, Anne Shirley's dancer Laura and Ronald Reagan's young Steve can finally be seen as somewhat lovely. In fact, this couple is only seen for their appearance.

A rare love tragedy, every time I think of the desolation of Waterloo Bridge, I vaguely remember Vivien Leigh walking on Waterloo Bridge. The sound of the car is pitiable, and she walks past with perseverance. The reflections in the water, the lights of the military vehicles, the staring yellow eyes of the devil, the system and fate, humanity's eternal wall. Her eyes look through it, and it is the memory of the candle dance. Joy is so short-lived, just a moment, a cry of sorrow. Robert Taylor has the same memory as us. Once, twice, having experienced the vicissitudes of life, he still remembers Waterloo Bridge in the dark night, so profound, so tragic. Mervyn LeRoy has every reason to be proud of this film.

### Soul of Freedom

— Wu Shuyu

According to the transcripts of the trials of traitors published in the newspapers, almost all of the thousands of them can be summed up with this formula: that is, every traitor, when on trial, is bound to explain the motives and circumstances of his becoming a traitor under compulsion. In this narrative of compulsion, he tries in every way to highlight that his motive was beneficial to the war of resistance, and that the circumstances involved covering up underground work within the anti-Japanese camp; sometimes, those cunning and fickle traitors, knowing full well that their absurd talk cannot sway the perceptions of the prosecutors, would turn their brains to insert an interlude, saying something like, "At the beginning, I originally intended to commit suicide, but later... it was not able to become a reality, and this may be a mistake," and so on. Just how many traitors said these absurd words, I don't have any clippings at hand to list them; but based on my memory, Ding Mocun, the head of the puppet secret service "76" on Jessfield Road, was one of them.

Later—no, perhaps a few days before the trial of Ding Mocun, the High Prosecutor's Office once summoned film artists who had sided with the enemy, but unfortunately, that summons resulted in those who were ill becoming sicker, and those who were escaping escaping, preventing us from reading their testimonies in the newspapers. Now, according to newspaper reports, the High Prosecutor's Office is preparing to summon another batch of film artists who sided with the enemy. It is difficult to repeat the same mistake, and whether the High Prosecutor's Office this time is taking precautions to prevent them from becoming ill again, or preventing them from escaping again, is unknown; but, as a movie fan, I very much hope that it will not be in vain and that I will be able to read their testimonies in the newspapers, and I am also willing to do some voluntary proofreading, to see just how different the testimonies of this batch of film artists who sided with the enemy are from the testimony of the puppet secret service head Ding Mocun? The reason is that the latter, in his actions, promoted the cause of the enemy and puppets, and crushed our patriotic heroes, while the former, in their thoughts, took their cues from the enemy to anesthetize and soften our patriotic heroes and our next generation.

If this voluntary proofreading finds that their testimonies are the same, and that there is also such an interlude, then they are truly "brothers in distress," thinking alike; and if, because this batch of film artists who sided with the enemy are artists, they even say and do, giving an on-the-spot performance, then the story is ready-made, the screenwriter and director are ready-made, and the actors are ready-made, so we can shoot a film and call it "Soul of Freedom." Who is the director? A joint director. Who are the actors? The entire cast. Then it is sure to be vivid and well-done, and "Silver Screen of the Ages" is sure to "be passed down for ten thousand generations."

Having written this far, what I wanted to say is already said; but picking up the manuscript and reading it from the beginning, I find that there is still one film boss missing. This not-so-small problem is really a bit troublesome. What to do? I can only look for him slowly. If I really can't find him, then regarding the affairs of the puppet China Film Company, there were the traitor Chu Minyi and the traitor Zhou Fohai, so why not choose between the two? If we choose Chu Minyi, then the "Number One" big traitors residing in foreign countries, such as Wang Zhaoming, Chen Gongbo, and the like, would certainly laugh loudly, "The China Film United Co., Ltd. has already been organized and established, and we will soon be able to see brand-new domestic films."

### Flowers

— Wu Changsong

### Four Poems Mourning the Deceased

— Wang Yizhi

The author, Mr. Wang Yizhi, and Ms. Li Zhaoshi, are among the best of contemporary married writers. Their relationship was deep and loving. They traveled in Europe for decades, working tirelessly. During the War of Resistance, Ms. Li, under the mandate of the Nationalist Government, devoted herself to the Dutch diplomatic circle, bearing burdens for her compatriots and advocating for her country, securing the safety of the rights and interests of overseas Chinese in that country, until she succumbed to illness from overwork, passing away this spring on March 3. When the bad news was transmitted remotely, relatives, friends, and old acquaintances alike deeply mourned her. Reading Mr. Yizhi's line, "Her jade body was truly donated for the sake of the people," further increases our infinite sorrow!

The attached picture is a Western-style art print that Ms. Li enjoyed during her lifetime, and it is hereby introduced.

Hard to turn back, the allotted time, a double three was hardship.
Impossible to fully recount the joys and sorrows of tens of thousands of weights.
Endless and boundless, grace like the sea,
Continuous Sunday morning window bells.

The world is endless, sorrow is endless. It is the double three memorial day of the passing of my late wife, Zhaoshi, which is also the so-called Sunday by Western religious scholars. From now on, every time I hear the crisp bells of the morning window on the Sabbath, I feel like the person visiting a foreign land in the novels of the beautiful novelist Bai Zhujun, overwhelmed by the sorrows of past and present.

Cold, lingering yellow bamboo, snow before the wind,
Dreams broken, azure meadow, world outside the home,
Compared to the outstanding Su Xiaomei in affection,
Illness akin to Jia Changsha's grief for the country.

Zhaoshi loved Dongpo's snow, and her illness was akin to Jia Yi's love for the country. Even in the third month of the northern spring, it was still bitterly cold, and the snow outside the hospital window had not completely melted.

Calamity and gold, a vast new catastrophe,
Pengzu and Shang, apes and cranes, all turned to dust,
Twice adrift, grieving over the European war,
Ten memories of flowers, tragically not spring.

In the years of Wuwu and Yiyou, they were adrift twice. Silently recognizing the unspoken, tragic farewell at the Catholic Hospital, it was exactly 9,999 days from Mao Yi's easy migration to North America. Alas, the calamity of war, which should be permanently abolished.

Chastity and strength tested in the fiery furnace,
Struggles relying entirely on great wisdom's circle,
Woman's writings, man's spirit,
Her jade body truly donated for the sake of the people.

For five years during the European war, she experienced countless storms and waves, busying herself day and night with rescue efforts, sparing no material or spiritual sacrifice, striving to cope, her strength exhausted and her body weakened. Apart from me, who else knows this? I had been separated from her for a long time. When sorting through her belongings, I found a letter to a certain public official dated January 30. The spirit of the writing is imperishable, further showing her chastity and strength.

### Pasteur, Benefactor of Mankind

— Xu Zhongnian

50th Anniversary of His Death

Louis Pasteur (1822-1895) was a great modern French biologist who discovered microbes, sparking a revolution in medicine and greatly benefiting mankind. His research focused on crystal formation, fermentation, diseases of wine, rabies, infectious diseases of livestock, and human infectious diseases. He was a member of the Académie Française and the Académie des Sciences. In 1886, international donations were used to build the Pasteur Institute in Paris, focusing on microbiology, serum therapy, and biochemistry. Subsequently, Pasteur Institutes were established in Lille, northern France, and in various cultural centers around the world; - China's Pasteur Institute is located at No. 207 Avenue Joffre, Shanghai (renamed Jin Shenfu Road).

This year marks the 50th anniversary of Pasteur's death. The Shanghai Pasteur Institute is scheduled to hold a commemorative ceremony at the Institute on Sunday, December 15th, at 9:00 a.m., and has specially invited experts to give a lecture: "The Progress of Pasteur's Inventions in Pure Biology and Everyday Science."

Since there is an expert lecture, I will not be adding anything superfluous. What I want to introduce is the humility and filial piety of this scholar who is admired all over the world. On July 14, 1882 (note: July 14 is France's National Day), the City Council of Dole, Pasteur's hometown, placed a commemorative plaque on the wall of the house where Pasteur was born, in the presence of Pasteur himself. After a speech by the mayor, Pasteur gave a reply: I am now translating this reply for commemoration.

Gentlemen:

The city of Dole has given me a great honor today, and I am deeply grateful; however, please allow me to protest against this excessive glory. This kind of respect is only suitable for famous deceased people, but it has been mistakenly bestowed upon a mere mortal like myself. However, you are too quick to go beyond the criticism of future generations!

Will your resolution be revised? Mr. Mayor, shouldn't you have first carefully notified the City Council not to adopt this too hasty plan?

But, gentlemen, I have protested against this overly flamboyant worship—which I am absolutely unworthy of—please allow me to express how deeply moved I am, down to the depths of my soul. On this commemorative plaque, your sympathy has combined the two things I have loved and been most excited about in my life: a love for science and a devotion to family.

Oh! My father and my mother! Oh! My dear departed ones! You used to live such frugal lives in this little house, and everything I have is a gift from you! My courageous mother, you passed on your enthusiasm to me. If I always combine the greatness of science with the greatness of the motherland, it is because I am filled with the ideas that you have inspired in me. And you, my dear father, your life was as difficult as your profession, and you once showed me what kind of results constant effort can achieve. It is because of you that I have learned to be persistent in my daily work. You not only provided the willpower to turn life into something useful, but you also worshiped great people and great causes. High vision and continued efforts to move upward: this is what you taught me. I recall that after finishing work every day, you would always read contemporary history, which reminded you of the glorious era you had witnessed. When you were teaching me reading and writing, you never forgot to teach me about the greatness of France.

Bless you, my beloved parents, for your usual words and deeds, let me give you the respect that is being shown to this house today.

Gentlemen, I thank you for allowing me to frankly state what I have thought in my heart for sixty years. I thank you for this celebration and your hospitality, and I thank the city of Dole, which watches over every one of its children, and has such a memory for me!

(Translated in Shanghai; December 11, 1946.)

Free Talk

### A Certain Factory Owner

— Shaofu

Yesterday, I met a certain factory owner at a banquet. He described his entrepreneurial experience to everyone, and some of his words were very meaningful and enlightening. I was very moved and would like to pass them on to my readers here.

He said: My business has suffered setbacks every year. In these ten years, if it weren't for these setbacks, the development of the business would certainly have been immeasurable. But thinking about it again, any kind of business has to suffer setbacks, and even the country suffers disasters! If there are no setbacks, the value of the business itself would be questionable. Courage can only appear in failure. One should face difficulties. The first type of ordinary businessmen only care about making money and don't care about anything else, and the second type sells their fields and buys property after making money, returning home to enjoy the blessings, wasting all the experience they have gained in their business. Neither of these two types is what our business community should have.

He also said: The encroachment of the recession is universally suffered by the entire business community. Everyone has difficulties, but there is no need to be overly alarmed like a snake in the cup, because if you are afraid, it will affect others. If others are also afraid, and everyone is afraid and doesn't take action, then isn't that a dead end?

I don't need to explain which factory this is, or what the owner's name is, but fifteen years ago he started this business with a capital of 7,000 yuan, and now it has become one of the leading manufacturers in this industry in the country. He has the courage, the vision, the willingness to sacrifice, is not afraid of difficulties, seeks progress, and does not deceive. All of these are factors in his success.

Let the rotten ones die. In the midst of the talk of recession in the business world, the true entrepreneurs will not fall. Perhaps this belief has not yet been recognized by the general public.

Fable Drama

### Farewell My Concubine

— Ge Chunliang

Cast: Strong as follows:

Chu Overlord — A certain factory boss, played by a local industrialist.

Yu Ji — Played by the boss's concubine

Fan Zeng — The factory's accountant (does not appear)

Scout — Played by a factory clerk

Han Xin — Gigolo (does not appear)

Dong Dong Qiang Qiang, gongs and drums start the show.

Chu Overlord: Thinking of the events of that year, how heartbreaking. I was so imposing in the past! I was invincible in every battle, always victorious. Yesterday prices rose by one time, today they rise by ten times, and tomorrow they will rise by a hundred times. Constantly rising, the "〇"s in the numbers were also captured by me one by one to increase the number of my assets. Not only did I make war profiteering, but I also made victory profiteering, and even dollar profiteering. But now, looking around, I am heavily in debt and have been besieged...

(The sound of songs of Chu from all sides is very noisy.)

Chu Overlord: Scout, go quickly and find out if the peddlers are gathering and coming, be careful of the glass windows!

(The scout leaves and returns.)

Scout: Reporting to the King, people's hearts are turning outward. The songs of Chu from all sides are just a chorus of shouts to buy foreign goods, as well as the sound of debt collection!

Chu Overlord! Alas—that infuriates me. Then, what should I do with my domestic products! Quickly summon Fan Zeng to devise a countermeasure.

Scout: Reporting to the King, Fan Zeng has left without saying goodbye, leaving this place to eat foreign food.

Chu Overlord: Ah...ah...spit, infuriates...infuriates me! You old thief, how could you have no patriotism!

Scout: Reporting to the King, you can't blame him. You can't pay his salary, but there are American dollars to be earned at the foreign company. Of course, Fan Zeng would abandon this and take that.

Chu Overlord: Alas, Heaven has forsaken me, Heaven has forsaken me! Customers are rushing to buy foreign goods, and employees are going to eat foreign food! Alas, a wooden factory owner, I, the Great King...alas, words cannot express it all!

Scout: Reporting to the King, although Fan Zeng went to eat foreign food, it is said that he didn't get to eat any "foreign meat" and got a "foreign stink" all over his body. Now he has died of scabies on the way!

Chu Overlord: That's right! History seems to have written it that way. Fan Zeng, that bitter old man, it was his fate to be so, well deserved! Come on, go invite Consort Yu Ji!

(The scout goes down, Yu Ji comes up)

Yu Ji: (A segment of singing before coming on stage. What she is singing, you wouldn't understand, so I have to delete it.) Yu Ji pays her respects to the Great King. May I ask what instructions the Great King has for summoning me?

Chu Overlord: My heart is very troubled, and I summoned you for no other reason than to ask my beloved consort to dance a sword for a while to ease my mind.

Yu Ji: You are old and immortal, are you senile? This is the atomic bomb era, do you still want to dance with swords?

Chu Overlord: You cheap thing, you are actually scolding me. What are you saying! What are you planning to do?

Yu Ji: You are already in a pile of debt, and you can't even pay the interest. What fun is there in being with you? I have decided to run away tomorrow.

Chu Overlord: Alas, that infuriates me. (Saying that, he began to sing the lyrics of "My strength uproots mountains, my spirit surpasses the world.")

"Prices rise, sorrow surpasses the world,
The time is unfavorable, foreign goods fill the market,
Interest at 20%, what can be done,
Wife runs off with another, what to do!"

Go, do as you please: Ah, wait a minute. Who are you running off with?

Yu Ji: The gigolo Han Xin.

Chu Overlord: Good heavens! I thought you were running off with the foreign sailor, Hello Joe! Nine out of ten gigolos are unreliable. How do you know that Han Xin definitely wants you?

Yu Ji: You can ask if you don't believe me. If he doesn't want me, I would rather commit suicide in front of you.

Chu Overlord picks up the phone and dials a number: Hello, is this Liu Bang's office? Get Han Xin on the phone. Hello, Han Xin, are you seducing my wife? What? You don't want her...

Yu Ji goes over, grabs the phone and says: Hello, darling, you...what?...you...ah, you heartless and soulless thing. (Saying that, she hangs up the phone.)

Chu Overlord: You didn't listen to my old advice, and you are suffering now. According to the plot, you should commit suicide while dancing with a sword. You said this is the atomic bomb era and refused to dance with a sword. Do you intend to commit suicide with an atomic bomb? Ah, that would be too extravagant, too much of a show.

Yu Ji remains silent, takes out a bottle of DDT from her bag, drinks three mouthfuls in a row, and then, alas, she dies! (She also goes back to rest backstage.)

Chu Overlord goes into battle again, but after a few rounds, he is defeated and forced by the creditors to the Wujiang intersection, where he meets the elders of Jiangdong—a group of "wild chicken lawyers."

Elders of Jiangdong: Great King, you don't need to fight with those creditors. Things are already like this, it's better to retreat early. Come to me, declare bankruptcy, and implement liquidation! When the Third World War breaks out, you can regroup and make war profiteering again!

Chu Overlord: I am grateful for your kindness. But forget it! I am a dignified seven-foot man and won't do those fussy things. Ah, let's open the skylight and speak frankly. The litigation fee, advertising fee, liquidation fee, etc. of your lawyers are also quite frightening. To be honest, I can't pay, I only have an empty checkbook left, I offer this to thank old friends and express my meager intentions. According to history and the plot, here at the Wujiang intersection, I, Xiang Yu, should draw my sword and commit suicide. However, Yu Ji is right, this is the atomic age, and doing this kind of thing again seems too foolish. Look, in the distance, a jeep has already driven over. To die under a peony flower is romantic even as a ghost, to die under a jeep should be modern even as a ghost! I wish my Chu Overlord to be famous for centuries! (The curtain closes! The play ends!)

### Words from a Clerk at a Western Clothing Store

— Shuo Shi

Yesterday, in a chance encounter, I met an old neighbor who runs a Western clothing store. We felt unexpectedly harmonious, truly like "a thousand cups are too few when drinking with a kindred spirit." From his words, he hinted at many inside stories of the Western clothing industry.

Not only him, but also I, always feel very strange, why do Chinese people blindly worship "foreign goods"? This is especially common in Shanghai. For example, take the current Western clothing industry: the fabrics displayed in the shop windows are mostly made in China. However, the Western clothing store owners all change their names to foreign ones, turning them into foreign goods, taking advantage of the general customers' blind worship of "foreign goods are always better" mentality. Sure enough, customers flock to the store; if not, business would be slow!

Furthermore, for example, if there is a piece of Melton cloth, the Western clothing store owner cuts it into two sections, one section saying it is made in China, the other section saying it is from a foreign source (but in fact, it is still from the same piece). When regular customers come, they pretend that this section is "Chinese goods" and that section is "foreign goods", letting customers choose. And surprisingly, there are customers who praise foreign goods as being better than Chinese goods. How truly absurd and wronged! Are these so-called "Chinese goods" and "foreign goods" not cut from the same piece of cloth?

### Here and Now

— Gan Lai

Group Suing for Land

Shanghai people like novelty. As long as the action is unusual, one can definitely prevail, whether it's doing business or begging.

Yesterday afternoon, I walked past Jinling East Road and saw five or six people kneeling side by side on the ground. In front of them, they had written several lines of begging words in chalk, all of which turned out to be suing for land.

Group suing for land – the term is fresh enough, and only Shanghai has it. But it also shows the seriousness of this "year-end hurdle."

Beauty Photo Studio

There is a photo studio on Linsen Middle Road. The photos taken are on average several degrees more beautiful than the person's original appearance. Often, when picking up the photos, it takes a minute or two to recognize oneself. Calling it a beauty photo studio can be said to match the name with the reality.

Unfortunately, that photo studio often delays the development and pick-up of photos, which is somewhat imperfect. Furthermore, one point should be specially reminded to readers: photographs from that photo studio are not reliable for choosing a husband or a girlfriend. At the very least, one should discount them by 20% or 30%.

杞人之憂 (Worries of the Man of Qi - Worries About Unnecessary Things)

With money in my pocket, I thought of buying a scarf to keep warm. I walked into the first store, liked one, and asked for the price, which was 32,000. Then I went into the second store and saw the same goods, priced at only 28,000. Although it was cheaper, I still couldn't bear to buy it. Finally, from a street vendor, I exchanged 20,000 for the same woolen scarf as before.

Afterwards, thinking about it, I was happy and fearful at the same time. Happy that I bought a bargain, afraid that before the end of the year, Shanghai would experience the same situation as above: "Store owners destroying street vendors"?

Shanghai Cross-Section

### The Beggars' Organization 16

— Huang Jia Mo

Scavenging · "Leading the Sheep" · "Walking Corpse"

In the local beggar gang, capable brothers all strive hard. Their paths to making money are as described in the previous sections. However, the older and weaker beggars in the gang, due to physical weakness, some addicted to opium, can't afford opium and switch to heroin. These people are lazy by nature, wearing tattered clothes, and are neither able to "work diligently" like their brothers in the gang, nor bear heavy burdens and travel far to sell their labor. Therefore, they have to act alone, at irregular times, on their own. This is considered the most humble beggar in the gang, not only looked down upon by passers-by, but also ashamed to be associated with by the brothers in the gang.

"Panning for Gold and Sweeping for Pearls" is such a beautiful term! It turns out it is the slang for scavenging. It is a testament to their creativity. These people go out scavenging every day with empty baskets, called "carrying a hundred-treasure box". Their lives are free and unrestricted. The destination for scavenging is the garbage cans in various alleys, and the garbage piles in residential areas. Although they are the lowest-level business, their income is considerable. Because the mansions and homes in Shanghai are mostly accustomed to extravagant living, often squandering resources, discarding miscellaneous items at will. The beggars are practitioners of waste utilization. In their eyes, there is money in these many garbage. They know how to "pan for gold and sweep for pearls". Whether it's old glass bottles, old cans, scrap metal, bamboo pieces, or wood, everything is worth collecting and then reselling to specialty shops for wasteland goods. Before the war, the average daily income could be one yuan.

In the era of the enemy puppet regime, resources were scarce. Any broken glass, waste paper, or damaged cloth could be used as raw materials for papermaking or other purposes. These beggars actually had a considerable surplus. After the war, when the U.S. military arrived in Shanghai, a large amount of American goods flowed in, and residents discarded the old for the new, often abandoning the old items that they had cherished in the past, adding a lot of valuable old goods to the beggars. Especially near the U.S. military barracks, one could often pick up large quantities of empty cans, old wooden boxes, and brand-new old cloth bags. Near the UNRRA warehouses, the abandoned miscellaneous items were extremely considerable. It was no longer "panning for gold and sweeping for pearls", but "accepting everything on the list". Because everything was valuable, no wonder the scavengers scrambled for it, fearing to miss it!

"Snatching the Sheep in Passing", abbreviated as "leading the sheep", is to engage in both scavenging and theft under the guise of scavenging. Their plan is very cunning and meticulous, and it is not easy to solve the case. The target items are the light and heavy miscellaneous items placed at the back doors of the residents in the alleys, stealing them when people are not paying attention. They immediately put them into the box of wasteland goods, and then cover them with unclean paper and cloth garbage. No one suspects them of stealing, and no one wants to inspect their dirty baskets. Therefore, they can freely enter and leave the alleys under the cover of scavenging, taking materials on the spot, appropriately and stopping. Although what they get are some not very valuable things, but over time, selling them can also be quite profitable. For example, "fresh lotus leaves" - (are clothes soaked in water buckets that have not yet been washed, and a few pieces are taken when the maid walks away). "Floating white paper" - (clothes that have been晒掛 - hung out to dry). "Moon" - (various sizes of wooden basins). "Dull crow" - (various sizes of chairs and stools). "Bird head" - (wooden toilet), and other scattered sundries.

There is also a strange profession called "stealing pig ears", which is theft combined with extortion. Those who engage in this must have two people as partners. "Pig ears" are toilet seat covers. One person first enters the alley early in the morning to scavenge, and steal toilet seat covers. At this time, most people are still asleep, and there are several toilets placed at the back doors of every household. Because the toilet matters have already been taken care of at this time, the maids are busy serving in the kitchen, and the toilets have been washed or not washed. Therefore, these people take the opportunity to "pick pig ears" a few, put them in the basket, and slip away. When the maids discover it, they immediately make a fuss. Then one person from the gang comes to inquire, saying that the thief has been seen, and how much money is needed to redeem it, the price ranging from one or two yuan per piece. Although the residents know that they are in league, they only want to redeem the items. They do not want to cause a lawsuit for this small amount. Originally, a toilet seat cover is not worth much, and it is even less valuable to resell after stealing it. However, residents cannot do without a toilet for a day, let alone a toilet seat cover. Toilets come in different sizes, and there is no place to buy a toilet seat cover specifically for a particular toilet, and there is absolutely nothing else that can replace it. As a result, the entire toilet is equivalent to garbage. The beggars deeply understand this difficulty and actually use stealing toilet seat covers as a way to extort money. It is truly the ultimate prank!

"Walking Corpse" is to be hired to carry the store's signboard, moving through the streets and alleys, or wearing strange clothes and hats, full of advertising words, acting as an active advertisement for the store. The individual is called "Walking Corpse". This profession was already seen in the early years of the Republic of China. But because it is vulgar and not elegant, it has almost disappeared in recent years.

Weekend Chats

### Between Mother-in-Law and Daughter-in-Law (Part 1)

— Collective Opinion

The Ever-Intense Family Problem

(Editor's Note: This time, there were the most submissions for this chat. This publication only selects different opinions from the submissions and discloses them below. Due to the excessive backlog of submissions, this issue will be repeated once in the next issue. New opinions are still extremely welcome.)

The Son Is Responsible

I believe that when the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law are at odds, the son should bear the majority of the responsibility. Because these types of family disputes are mostly caused by his inability to evenly divide the love and obligations between his mother, his son and his wife. (Qian Changnian)

Physiological Factors

In addition to conflicting interests, there are also physiological reasons for the discord between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. Although mother-in-law and daughter-in-law are both women, their temperaments and actions are often in opposite positions. The age difference between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law is at least more than twenty years. Physiologically, when a woman is around 24 years old, her blood and energy are strong, her actions are lively, and she easily reacts to all stimuli. If she is around 45 years old, menstruation begins to stop. Women in menopause are prone to emotional changes, have peculiar temperaments, are extremely prone to anger, and their ability to adapt to the environment is very weak. Therefore, in terms of temperament, one is calm and stubborn, and the other is lively and active. Coupled with conflicting interests, of course there is no way to reconcile! (Yun Xin)

The Conflict of Two Kinds of Love

To put it thoroughly, it is destined that there is no way to coordinate between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. This is a conflict between husband-wife love and mother-son love, an opposition of two different interests. There is nothing that can make the two of them close together. Even if it is superficial harmony, it is only the result of their wider tolerance and deeper cultivation. It is definitely not that this mother-in-law and daughter-in-law really have no cracks. Mother-son love and husband-wife love may be balanced, but once an accident occurs, mother-son love often cannot defeat husband-wife love! The reason is very simple: in terms of interests, husband-wife love, the lifelong interests of both are consistent. In terms of physiology, the ages are similar, and "sexual love" is exchanged. Therefore, as long as the relationship between husband and wife is really good, it is inevitable that the son will be slightly biased towards his wife. To be frank, this is due to the facts, and it is also due to the inherent selfishness of human beings! Therefore, the mother-in-law is always jealous of the daughter-in-law.

Therefore, the separation of mother-in-law and daughter-in-law is the fundamental solution. Other non-thorough methods are only temporary and not permanent. (Suo Bei)

"Marrying a Daughter-in-Law"

It is clearly the son's marriage, but Mrs. × is called "marrying a daughter-in-law." The dignity of the mother-in-law can be displayed from this sentence. It also predetermines the relationship between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. (E)

A Word for the Mother-in-Law

Smart mother-in-law, I want to advise you, but please believe my sincerity and do not get angry. The current era is very different from the era when you were a daughter-in-law. The difference in social awareness and the progress of educational culture have already divided you and your daughter-in-law into two different areas. I think, when you were a daughter-in-law, you also secretly resented your strict, meticulous, and fault-finding mother-in-law. But at that time, limited by the old social concepts and the shackles of feudal thoughts, you had to hate in your heart even if you hated, shed tears secretly, and still had to wear a smile on your face on the surface. In fact, at that time, you also wanted to avoid the mother-in-law's over-strict control and live a free and happy life, didn't you? Therefore, now you forgive your daughter-in-law a little bit. People now cannot be compared with people in the past. Don't say those angry words of "marrying a daughter-in-law and selling a son"! Who doesn't love to play, jump, and live their little family life freely! Just let go, why bother to be their villain? You can ask nothing and enjoy your blessings peacefully, and be an affectionate mother-in-law! (Feng)

Three Opinions

(1) One's own daughter is the daughter-in-law of someone else in the future; one's own daughter-in-law is the former daughter of someone else; and the status of mother-in-law is also promoted from daughter-in-law. Although mother-in-law and daughter-in-law are not mother and daughter, they are all from "daughter" backgrounds and have tasted the taste of "mother-daughter love". If the mother-in-law can treat the daughter-in-law with the heart of treating her daughter, and the daughter-in-law can treat the mother-in-law with the heart of treating her mother, then, no matter what prejudice, it can be transformed into harmony and harmony!

(2) If they can be self-reliant, it is best for the daughter-in-law to form a small family with her husband, and live in a small house, so that the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law will have less separation and more gatherings. On the day of reunion, all previous faults will be released and the friendship will be more constant!

(3) If there is no ability to be self-reliant, then the daughter-in-law has to endure it for a while even if she is full of grievances! Only "do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself." When you become a mother-in-law in the future, don't vent the grievances you have suffered in the past on your daughter-in-law; otherwise, to put it jokingly, "retribution comes full circle", the feelings between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law will forever become a "fixed case"! (Yang Ren)
