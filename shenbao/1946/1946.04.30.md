### The Northeast Problem Has Not Yet Reached an Agreement, Discussions to Continue in Nanjing, Marshall Paid Another Visit to Chairman Chiang Yesterday

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] Foreign News: Marshall's negotiations on the Northeast issue must first establish a harmonious draft in Chongqing. He hopes that after both parties move to Nanjing to change the environment, the negotiations can be successfully completed in a harmonious and stable atmosphere. Therefore, the departure date has been postponed again. The weather along the Yangtze River has been unfavorable yesterday and today. If the weather clears on the 30th, Marshall may come to Nanjing immediately; otherwise, it will be delayed until the 2nd of next month. Impartial figures in Nanjing generally hope that the Communist army in Northern Jiangsu will no longer greet this peace envoy with gunpowder and bloodshed.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] Chongqing News: The new actions of the Communist army in Northern Jiangsu, when reported to Chongqing, caused a ripple in the Northeast negotiations that were proceeding smoothly. However, due to the government's extremely calm attitude, it quickly subsided. The Northeast negotiations are still in the process of bargaining. It is heard that Marshall's proposed new ceasefire plan, together with the memorandum, includes ten points: (1) a comprehensive ceasefire in the Northeast; (2) the Communist army must not occupy Harbin, and the National army will temporarily postpone its advance towards Changchun; (3) with regard to local political power, both sides will temporarily adopt a reserved attitude and resolve it through consultation; (4) the U.S. ships transporting the National army will adhere to the principle of receiving sovereignty; (5) the Communist army must not obstruct any government actions in repatriating prisoners of war and sending overseas Chinese; (6) restore transportation as soon as possible, and neither side should cut off or divide transportation in the Northeast; (7) after the ceasefire order is issued, both sides will immediately cease fire, which facilitates the start of military mediation work; (8) all troops entering the Northeast from both sides must use the integrated army plan as the principle for organization; (9) after the U.S. troops withdraw from North China, the National army will take over the defense; (10) both sides must stop the propaganda war in good faith.

[United Press, Nanjing, 29th] Today's Xinmin Bao Chongqing dispatch stated that Special Envoy Marshall has proposed four points to Chairman Chiang and the representatives of the Chinese Communist Party to resolve the serious situation in the Northeast: (1) immediate and unconditional ceasefire; (2) maintaining the status quo of the Northeast regime before the general election; (3) reorganizing the troops in the nine eastern provinces in accordance with the integrated army plan; (4) stop using American ships to transport the Central Army to the Northeast except for the purpose of receiving territory. Regarding the defense zones of the various armies in the Northeast, it will be decided by a three-person group. Marshall also attached a note stipulating that after the U.S. troops withdraw from North China, two divisions of the Central Army will take over the defense. It is heard that the government has agreed to abide by the second point, but insists on receiving Changchun first before the ceasefire order is issued.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 29th] According to the U.S. Information Service, Marshall started a meeting with Zhou Enlai, the representative of the Chinese Communist Party, at 10:30 this morning, and the meeting was still in progress at noon. Marshall is scheduled to visit Chairman Chiang again at Shandong this afternoon for talks.

[United Press, Chongqing, 29th] Special Envoy Marshall has still failed to reconcile the opinions of the government and the Chinese Communist Party, so the war in the Northeast has not been resolved for the time being. Well-informed sources in the Chinese side said that the ceasefire plan proposed by the Democratic League advocates that the Communist army should occupy most of the Northeast, which Chairman Chiang has rejected. He would rather wait until the National army recovers Changchun before ceasing fire. Marshall has now ordered his headquarters to move to Nanjing tomorrow. A spokesperson for the Chinese Communist Party said that the negotiations in Chongqing have ended, and the representatives of the Chinese Communist Party will go to Nanjing in the next few days to continue consultations. Chairman Chiang is expected to go to the capital on May 3rd. Chairman Chiang, Marshall, and Zhou Enlai have discussed various ceasefire methods. The latest ceasefire plan was drafted by the Democratic League and agreed by Zhou and Marshall. It was submitted to Chairman Chiang last night. The suspension of the negotiations shows that the plan has been rejected. Well-informed sources said that the Chinese Communist Party was willing to give up Changchun, Harbin, and the Tiechang Railway a month ago in order to seek a ceasefire, but now it demands a higher price for peace, insisting that the overall situation in the Northeast must be resolved according to the current situation. If so, the area occupied by the Chinese Communist Party will be almost eight-ninths of the Northeast. All parties know that Marshall has done his best to stop the war before the battle for Changchun breaks out again.

### Du Yuming Departs for Inspection, Fierce Fighting Unfolding on the Outskirts of Sipingjie

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 29th] Shenyang Dispatch: Du Yuming has departed from Shenyang to inspect the National army's reception situation. It is not yet certain when he will return to Pan. Zheng Dongguo has long been at the front, and Liang Huasheng is now in Kaiyuan. It is said that there will be fierce fighting in the Liaohe area.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 29th] Combining news from the government and the Chinese Communist Party, Xin Sipingjie is currently still in the hands of the Communist army. Part of the National army did enter Xin Sipingjie on the evening of the 20th, but withdrew immediately due to the fierce firepower of the defending army. The battle is still ongoing on the outskirts of Sipingjie, and the strength of the two sides is comparable, so the battle has almost reached a stalemate. The battle for the defense of Sipingjie began on April 4, after the National army moved into Changtu. After the 18th, the battle became more intense. Part of the 12th Army under the New First Army advanced along the Changtie Railway from the south and southeast. Another part of the New First Army, in coordination with the 31st Army, advanced from the west and southwest along the Sitao Road, detouring to the northwest of Sipingjie. However, the Communist army's strength is strong, which was quite unexpected to the National army. Therefore, the encirclement could not be gradually reduced, and the two armies are still in a fierce battle.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 29th] Today, I met a non-official from the Northeast. He personally went to the vicinity of Xin Sipingjie three days ago to investigate the truth of the battle situation. According to him, the reception progress of the National army in the Northeast is very slow because the Communist army used all possible conditions to obstruct it. It is true that two platoons of the National army entered Xin Sipingjie, but they lost contact with the National army outside Sipingjie. He did not dare to determine whether there was still fighting in Sipingjie at the time he left Sipingjie. A part of the vanguard troops of the National army also bypassed Sipingjie and advanced about ten kilometers to the north, but the troops above the second regiment also lost contact with the National army in Sipingjie. He said that there are a considerable number of foreigners in Sipingjie assisting the Communist army in combat with heavy artillery. These foreigners with weapons are former Japanese soldiers who were prisoners of war of the Soviet army.

[Associated Press, Beiping, 29th] According to sources from the Chinese side here, torrential rain has fallen on the front line of Sipingjie in the past 72 hours, making it more difficult for the National army to advance. It is said that the roads there have become muddy due to melting snow, and the continuous heavy rain has made it almost impossible to send reinforcements and military supplies. General Zheng Dongguo, who led the New First Army and the New Sixth Army in Burma, is currently commanding military affairs in Sipingjie. According to Chinese sources, the Communist army has not only cut off transportation at Sipingjie and Gongwangling, but also built a strong defense line on the north bank of the Liaohe River.

[Another dispatch] Today, according to the latest military news from Pan, the vanguard of the New First Army is currently launching a fierce attack northward along the Shenchang Railway with a "fan-shaped" tactic. The front line in the Sipingjie area has rapidly expanded to sixty miles.

### Key Personnel for Northeast Reception Arrive in Vladivostok

Zhang Zuoxiang and Others Arrive in Shenyang from Jinzhou

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 29th] Niu Xianming, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Government of the Military Mediation Department, went to Shenyang to prepare to negotiate the safety of government reception personnel trapped in Changchun.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 29th] It is learned here that seventy senior officials of the Chinese government's personnel sent to the Northeast for reception have arrived in Vladivostok.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 29th] Zhang Zuoxiang, Wang Shuhan, and more than forty other members of the Political Committee of the Northeast Headquarters arrived in Shenyang from Jinzhou today.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 29th] Xu Pengfei, Director of the Secretariat of the Northeast Headquarters, completed his official duties in Beiping and flew to Pan this morning, accompanied by Wang Zheng, Deputy Director of the Changtie Railway.

### Yongnian City in Southern Hebei Has Hope of Being Relieved, Two Methods Have Been Agreed Upon: Organizing a Grain Transportation Committee and Replacing Commanders

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 29th] In order to relieve the siege of Yongnian, the Military Mediation Department has agreed on three items, one of which is to replace the leaders of both sides' troops. The government's new candidate went there yesterday, while the Communist side is still considering.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 29th] Luo Ruiqing, Chief of Staff of the Communist side of the Military Mediation Department, went to Chongqing to report to Zhou Enlai on the investigation of the Northeast by the representatives of the Military Affairs Three-Person Team. He flew back to Zhangjiakou yesterday and will return to Beiping tomorrow.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 29th] Yongnian in Southern Hebei has been besieged for a long time. After many days of efforts by the Military Mediation Department, two methods of relieving the siege have been agreed upon: (1) organizing a grain transportation agency to provide relief to disaster victims; (2) replacing the commanders of the troops inside and outside Yongnian City on both sides. A food committee has been jointly formed by the three parties and local people to be responsible for transporting grain and providing relief to residents. Regarding the replacement of commanders, the Eleventh War Zone dispatched a senior staff officer to Yongnian yesterday to take over. The Communist side is asking Liu Bocheng for instructions on the candidate for the new commander.

### The Communist Army Concentrates Sixty Regiments on the Longhai and Jinpu Lines; the Communist Army Attacking Nantong Is Unable to Support and Retreats

[Our Nanjing Urgent Dispatch, 29th] Military news: The Communist army has concentrated more than sixty regiments in Hai'an, Rugao, and Nantong-Haimen near Northern Jiangsu, Jiangyan in Taixian, the line from Baitapu to Daxujia on the eastern section of Longhai Road, the territory of Lai'an County in Anhui, ninety li away from Liuhe, and Lincheng on the Jinpu Line, and launched a widespread offensive, claiming to "liberate" Wuzhou (Yangzhou, Taizhou, Tongzhou, Xuzhou, Zhengzhou), and will re-attack the Jiawang Coal Mine. Although the official side does not deny the seriousness of the situation, it is indeed confident in its ability to quell the chaos and respond to changes. The generals who came to Nanjing to preside over training a few days ago have all returned to their defenses. It is heard that Deputy Chief of Staff Bai has arrived in Zhengzhou and will return to Nanjing at the beginning of the month.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 29th] Since the Communist army occupied the three towns of Guanyinshan, Xingren, and Xiaohai east of Nantong, the National army has actively strengthened its strength and, with the assistance of the air force, began a counterattack at 2:00 pm on the 28th. As of this afternoon, the vanguard troops are only four li away from Xiaohai Town.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] Military news: The Communist army launched a three-pronged attack on Nantong County on the evening of the 27th and at dawn on the 28th. After the National army counterattacked, the Communist army was unable to support and retreated. As of the morning of the 29th, the National army had successively recovered Xiaohai Town and Guanyinshan Town. However, the Communist army's actions in violating the ceasefire order seem to be an attempt to disrupt the security of Nanjing and Shanghai when the National Assembly is about to convene. The military authorities are closely monitoring its development.

### A Record of the Fierce Battle of Changchun

[Associated Press, Changchun, 19th] (Delayed) After the withdrawal of the Soviet army, 30,000 ragged Communist troops have completely occupied Changchun, the capital of the Northeast, today. They are mostly equipped with Japanese rifles and old American Winchester rifles. They had a bloody battle with 9,000 government troops beforehand. Every street and every house has undergone fierce fighting. The battle lasted for six days.

Most of the Communist troops participating in this battle were troops of the Eighth Route Army, commanded by Commander-in-Chief Lin Biao. This battle is extremely important in terms of strategy and politics, because the Communist army's occupation of Changchun has cut off the relationship between the government troops and northern Manchuria, including Harbin, which the Soviet army is scheduled to withdraw from on April 25.

The Communist troops poured into Changchun from four directions, covered by artillery fire. The number was unprecedented in the Northeast. After breaking through Changchun's internal defense line, they forced the National army to retreat towards Datong Square. The National army was squeezed in this square as if they were sardines. They turned six public buildings into defensive fortresses, stuffing windows with old books, municipal archives, furniture, and sandbags, hoping to hold on until the New First Army could arrive from Sipingjie. However, the gunfire from the nearby rooftops forced the National army to retreat to Datong Square, which was only one-fifth of a mile in diameter, resulting in being either swept by bullets or captured.

According to reliable sources, 300 of the 1,500 National army troops made a final struggle in the Central Bank. They died in action during the final charge yesterday. Chen Jiazhen, the Major General Commander of the National army in Changchun, personally led his troops with a pistol in hand. General Chen was shot in the leg and fell to the ground, and was captured by the Communist army.

The six buildings serving as fortresses in Datong Square were successively occupied by the Communist army on Thursday afternoon and evening. The Central Bank, the headquarters of General Chen Jiazhen, finally fell at 9:00 pm.

Eberne, a correspondent for the International Telegraph Agency, and this reporter (Barkat, a correspondent for the Associated Press), visited Mayor Zhao Junmai on Thursday afternoon and were almost trapped inside the Central Bank Building. While we were there, American lend-lease planes piloted by Chinese pilots flew over and dropped ammunition by parachute. I ran to the roof and saw that most of the parachutes landed in the Communist army's area, but by the next morning, all the parachutes had landed within the National army's defense line. At that time, I suddenly realized that the Communist Party was advancing from all four directions, less than a thousand yards from Datong Square. Bullets flew over the roof, hissing, and more and more. The soldiers guarding the sandbags were gradually injured. I found Eberne and Mayor Zhao and hurried downstairs, wanting to return to the Mayor's home. We jumped into a car when a volley of gunfire swept into the field where a large amount of ammunition was stored. One of the bullets hit our car. The wounded were carried away on stretchers, while the retreating National army crowded into the Central Bank Building to prepare for the final defense.

We got into the car and rushed to the mayor's house. About half a li from our destination, three bullets hit our car, but no one was injured. Half an hour later, we looked out of the window and saw thousands of Communist soldiers with rifles and machine guns creeping towards Datong Square, fighting for Datong Square. Our house had become an outpost on the front line, and the National army's bullets were flying towards us. Several Communist soldiers saw the American flag on our roof and smiled at us. In a field next door, they had already begun digging trenches and machine gun nests. Then the Communist Party ran into our house, set up cannons at two windows, and chose targets to shoot at.

They looked at us as if we were rare birds and strange animals in a zoo. Few of them had seen Americans. Most of them thought we were Russians and tried to talk to us in a few Russian words. With the help of an interpreter, we learned that most of them were from the Eighth Route Army from Shandong, as well as a considerable number of New Fourth Army troops. Their clothes were ragged and their shoes were especially shabby, but their weapons, though mixed, could be used in combat. One of the reasons why the National army lacked heavy weapons was that the 4,000 National army troops in Changchun were airlifted from Beiping.

The Communist army's battle for Changchun was divided into five stages: (1) seizing three airfields to cut off the National army's communication in the air; (2) occupying the city's only railway station, so that the Communist army could obtain reinforcements from the north by rail; (3) squeezing the small number of National army troops into Datong Square; (4) attacking them again at Datong Square; (5) sweeping the entire city the next day.

[Associated Press, Beiping, 29th] Responsible Communist officials stated today that a joint investigation team composed of a Communist Party member and an American representative revealed that the Communist Party's claim that American aircraft attacked the United Democratic Army in the Sipingjie area was incorrect. It was discovered that what the Communist Party referred to was originally an American aircraft, but it was immediately handed over to the Chinese Air Force in accordance with the post-war agreement. This handover was announced some time ago.

### The Communist Army Destroys the Beining Railway; the Ping-Shenyang Train Is Again Blocked; a U.S. Representative of the Military Mediation Department Is Shot and Wounded by the Communist Army

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 29th] Amidst the fierce fighting in the Northeast, the Communist army resumed its movement to sabotage the National army's military transport, destroying the Beining Road. At 11:00 pm last night, the Communist army suddenly attacked the Jiangjia signal station (south of Suizhong) on the Guandong section of the Beining Road. As of this morning, it was still in fierce battle with the defending army. At the same time, Bridge No. 349 at Wanjia Tun and Qian Suo Wen was also damaged by 20 meters, so the Ping-Pan army was again blocked. The New First Army military train scheduled to depart from Qinhuangdao to Pan today was temporarily cancelled.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 29th] Military news: Lieutenant Colonel Grief, the U.S. representative of the 26th Group of the Military Mediation Department stationed in Chaoyang, was traveling in a jeep to inspect the area near Dong Guanyingzi, forty-five li west of Beipiao. When passing through Dong Guanyingzi and advancing half a li north of Xiaobagou, after the National army made many contacts, the Communist army did not believe it and opened fire, killing one local villager who was guiding the way. Lieutenant Colonel Grief was also injured.

### Ambassador Gu Visited President Song Yesterday to Discuss Current Diplomatic Issues; After Visiting Graves in Jiading, He Will Fly to England to Resume His Post

[Central News Agency, This City] Dr. Gu Weijun, our country's ambassador to the United Kingdom, accompanied by Secretary Liu Xuancui, flew from Chongqing to Nanjing on the 27th. That evening, they took the night express train and arrived in Shanghai on the morning of the 28th. Yesterday afternoon, Mr. Gu visited President Song and discussed current diplomatic issues. At 11:00 AM, he met with reporters. Despite the fatigue of several days of travel, he was still in high spirits. It is said that Mr. Gu will go to Jiading to sweep graves in the coming days. After a brief stay, he will fly from Shanghai to England to resume his post. The following is a selection of the contents of Mr. Gu's remarks:

The Holding of the Peace Conference is Not Far Off

The recent meeting of the four foreign ministers in Paris is a prelude to the world peace conference and is attracting worldwide attention. When asked by reporters about his observations, Ambassador Gu said that the main topic of the four foreign ministers' meeting was to discuss the basic principles of peace and to resolve some practical issues of the European Axis satellite states. Since the London Five Foreign Ministers Meeting, the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Meeting, and the Five Foreign Ministers' Representatives Meeting, concrete solutions to these problems have not yet been reached. I believe that the countries at this meeting will be able to reach a satisfactory agreement in the spirit of mutual concession and understanding, thereby stabilizing the international situation in Europe and further stabilizing the world situation. Apart from the Anglo-Siamese treaty, no other peace treaties have been concluded since the war. It has been almost a year since the collapse of the Axis powers, and the wise men of the United Nations are hoping that a world peace treaty will be produced as soon as possible. We ourselves also share this ardent hope. The convening of the Paris Peace Conference should not be far off.

Next, regarding the issue of the new League of Nations and the international trusteeship system, Mr. Gu said that the two United Nations agencies have had detailed discussions on the international trusteeship system in previous meetings. The principles and purposes of the trusteeship have been stipulated in the United Nations Charter, but the implementing agency has not yet been determined. It is possible that a trusteeship committee will be established at the United Nations General Assembly in September of this year to be responsible for hosting it. When asked by reporters whether the Montreux Convention is applicable at present, Mr. Gu explained that the treaty has been in place for ten years, and in order to maintain international permanent peace, it may need to be revised or changed in the future.

Atomic Energy Should Be Used Rationally

The reporter then asked Ambassador Gu that people around the world have different views on the application of atomic energy, advocating secrecy and openness. What is the proper view? The Ambassador explained that in order to solve the general problem of atomic energy, there is already an organization of the Atomic Energy Control Commission internationally, organized by eleven countries of the League of Nations Council and twelve countries including Canada. The main tasks of the committee are four: (1) Exchange of scientific knowledge, (2) Application of atomic energy for peaceful production, (3) Restricting the use of atomic energy weapons by various countries, (4) Banning and punishing all acts that violate the principles of atomic energy control, but the overall application of the atomic energy program has not yet been established. There is no doubt about the future supply of atomic energy for scientific production, but it will still take considerable time.

Regarding the promotion of Sino-British trade, Mr. Gu said: Trade between China and Britain began the earliest in history and has never been interrupted. After this war, Britain is making every effort to restore production and hopes to increase foreign trade. Our country has long advocated trade cooperation with friendly countries. The future development of trade between the two countries is foreseeable, but some specific issues still need to be mutually understood and jointly resolved by the authorities of the two countries. Mr. Xian also mentioned the Hong Kong issue, believing it to be a political issue, which will surely be resolved concretely after a considerable period of time.

Agrees with the Food Conservation Movement

Talking about the world food distribution issue again, Mr. Gu said: Food shortages have become a widespread phenomenon. This year, India, Australia, South Africa, and other countries have all suffered droughts, with insufficient harvests and reduced exports. After the establishment of the Anglo-American-Canadian World Food Management Committee, they even believed that our country is an agricultural country, so it was not sufficiently allocated. In fact, our country imported a large amount of food every year before the war to alleviate famine. Since this war, the lack of food has been more serious than in European countries. For the purpose of purchasing food, I was one week late in returning during the Second Plenary Session, and consulted in detail with the British authorities. It is expected that after the autumn harvest, our country will be able to obtain more food supplies. Recently, the Ministry of Food has telegraphed the whole country to implement a food conservation movement, which I strongly support. Currently, Britain, the United States, and other countries are also restricting brewing and implementing food conservation. Finally, when asked by reporters about the Northeast issue, Mr. Gu said: Our country is located among the great powers. Solving the Northeast issue is not limited to diplomatic channels. At present, the government is making its best efforts, adhering to a certain policy, and seeking a reasonable solution within the scope of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Treaty. I firmly believe that a concrete solution can be obtained in the shortest possible time. At this point, the reporters bid farewell and left.

### Celebration of the National Government Establishment Anniversary and the Capital Return Ceremony Combined; Nanjing Preparing a Grand Welcome for Chairman Chiang

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] The Preparatory Committee for the National Government's Capital Return Ceremony held its third meeting at the National Assembly Preparatory Committee at 3:00 PM this afternoon. Representatives present included Ma Chaojun, Zhang Daofan, Xiao Qin, Jin Gui, Chen Shaohuang, Hong Lanyou, and Lu Jingshi, totaling twenty-eight people. It was resolved to combine the "May Fifth" Celebration of the National Government Establishment Anniversary with the Celebration of the National Government's Capital Return Ceremony. Wu Tiecheng, originally nominated as the chairman of the Capital Return Ceremony, was replaced by Ma Chaojun as chairman. The position of deputy director has not yet been selected. Chairman Chiang decided to return to Nanjing to attend the ceremony. It was unanimously passed that on "May Fifth," when the ceremony is held, 101 cannons will be fired. Chairman Chiang will personally go to the mausoleum to pay his respects and broadcast to the whole country. The Aviation Commission will also send a large number of airplanes to distribute leaflets and public notices, totaling 300,000 copies. The Central Propaganda Department's film crew will also dispatch staff to participate in the filming of the movie. The city's people will also hold a welcome rally on the same day to express their warm respect for the nation's savior, Chairman Chiang, and the capital return personnel. At that time, Chen Yuguang, Speaker of the City Council, will deliver a speech on behalf of the capital's 800,000 citizens.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] President Chuan Xian of the Examination Yuan and his wife, accompanied by Vice President Zhou Yuezhong, arrived in Nanjing at 3:00 PM this afternoon on China Airlines flight 141. It is said that Du Yun will come to Nanjing immediately.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] Xu Tingyao and Chen Liang, Director of the Military Supplies Department, arrived in Nanjing today on a China Airlines flight. Chen Liang flew directly to Shanghai.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] Soviet Ambassador Petrov, Commercial Representative Slyaev, Counselor Miklashevsky, Military Attaché Major General Rosin, and more than forty embassy staff and their families arrived in the capital at 6:10 PM on the 29th, flying from Chongqing in two special planes. Huang Keming, Chief of the External Affairs Section of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as well as Soviet Counselor Federlin, First Secretary Gaudanov, Deputy Military Attaché Colonel Vorishenko and his wife, all went to the airport to greet them. Mrs. Vorishenko also presented flowers to welcome them. The Ambassador told reporters that he was deeply delighted to arrive in the restored capital of China.

### Mei Siping's Investigation Concluded; Public Trial in Nanjing Within Five Days; Capital High Court Prosecutor's Office Filed a Public Prosecution

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] The Capital High Court Prosecutor's Office concluded its investigation into the case of Mei Siping colluding with the enemy to plot resistance against our country. A public prosecution was filed on the 29th, and a public trial is scheduled to be held within five days. It is reported that President Qian will personally serve as the presiding judge. This is the first public trial of a traitor since the restoration of the capital, and it is expected to cause a sensation throughout the city.

[Further Telegram] Mei Siping colluded with the enemy to plot resistance against our country. The main points of the indictment filed by the prosecutor of the Capital Court are as follows: Defendant Mei Siping, male, 50 years old, from Yongjia, Zhejiang, residing at No. 42 Beiping Road, Nanjing (currently in custody). Criminal facts: The defendant was originally a member of the Chinese Kuomintang and served as the magistrate of Jiangning Experimental County and the administrative inspector of Jiangning District. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the defendant went to Hong Kong. In mid-November of the 27th year, he secretly went to Shanghai with Gao Zongwu and negotiated five basic conditions for peace that would cede power and humiliate the country with Major Sazo Teisho and Lieutenant Colonel Imai Takeo, who were sent by the Japanese side. He secretly presented them to traitor Wang Jingwei in Chongqing. Enemy chief Konoe Fumimaro immediately issued a statement based on this. Traitor Wang Jingwei therefore betrayed the central government, fled to Hanoi, and issued the "Glamorous Telegram" in response. On April 15 of the 28th year, the defendant and Zhou Fohai went to Shanghai to promote "peace," gathered party members, and on June 1, flew to Tokyo with traitor Wang Jingwei to secretly discuss peace conditions with the enemy chiefs. After returning to Shanghai, he participated in the puppet National Congress. After the outbreak of the European War, the defendant participated in the negotiations of the "Sino-Japanese Peace Plan" in November of the same year. On January 20 of the 29th year, he attended the Qingdao Conference and negotiated the merger with the Restoration and Provisional Second Government. On March 20 of the same year, he reopened the political conference and presided over the guiding principles for adjusting the new Sino-Japanese relations and the establishment of the puppet central government. After the establishment of the puppet government on March 30, the defendant served as a member of the puppet Central Political Committee, a standing member of the puppet Kuomintang Central Executive Committee, and a member of the puppet National Defense Supreme Committee. He also served as the Minister of the puppet Ministry of Industry and Commerce and Chairman of the Food Committee. After the reorganization of the puppet Ministry of Industry and Commerce, he succeeded as the Minister of the puppet Ministry of Industry and the Chairman of the puppet Zhejiang Provincial Government, as well as the Minister of Interior and the Director-General of the Anti-Smoking Bureau. After Japan's surrender, he was arrested by the Military Affairs Committee's Investigation and Statistics Bureau and transferred to the investigation department. Evidence and the laws violated: The defendant admitted to the initial peace talks with the enemy and to serving in various positions in the puppet government. Moreover, he has the "Complete Account of the Peace Movement" and other books and various report records of the puppet organization, which are sufficient to prove that he has the act of colluding with the enemy, which is very obvious. As for the defendant's claim that "we not only did not resist our country, but also assisted in the War of Resistance and rescued the people in the occupied areas," it is obviously a fabricated defense in light of the above-mentioned facts and evidence. Moreover, while serving as the Chairman of the puppet Food Committee, the defendant collected more than 153,000 stones of military grain for the enemy (see the book "Overview of the Puppet Government's Administration" published on March 30 of the 31st year). He also participated in the puppet government's decision to declare war on Britain and the United States, and was clearly in a hostile position with the central government. How can it be said that he never resisted our country, and what assistance can there be in the War of Resistance? In summary, it should be recognized that the defendant committed the crimes of Article 2, Paragraph 1, Clauses 1, 5, and 10 of the Regulations for Punishing Traitors, and should be prosecuted in accordance with Article 1 of the Special Criminal Case Litigation Regulations and Article 235, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

### Hebei High Prosecutor's Office Interrogating Major Traitors; Nanjing is Collecting Evidence of Jiang Zhengqing's Crimes

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] Shu Disheng, the deputy officer of the security team of the puppet Fengxing County, was sentenced to two years and six months in prison by the Anhui High First Branch Court on the 27th. Seven traitors, including Yu Jun, Wang Liqi, Fang Ruiwu, Song Monong, Xie Chexun, Chen Houji, and Li Shaoru, are being interrogated by the court.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 29th] The Hebei High Prosecutor's Office began interrogating mutual traitors on the 29th. Those who were interrogated today were You Bolu, Chi Zongmo, Luo Jin, and Wan Zhaozhi.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] The news that a Nanjing city councilor recently reported the problem representative Jiang Zhengqing has spread throughout the country. Because Jiang automatically resigned as a National Assembly representative, Nanjing citizens generally believe that Jiang is guilty and afraid of punishment. Relevant authorities believe that Jiang has committed serious crimes as an economic traitor and are collecting evidence to prepare for reporting him. It is said that Jiang has already written a confession of up to 10,000 words. Jiang's past crimes, which were first disclosed in the newspaper today, include: (1) During the enemy-puppet period, he colluded with North China traitor merchants to traffic drugs, which was cracked by Lin Bosheng. (2) After the Japanese surrender, he bribed officials to become the director of the Chamber of Commerce Preparatory Committee. However, according to anti-traitor personnel, Jiang also committed the serious crime of directly funding the enemy with military materials, which cannot be denied.

### Archbishop Cai Ning Arrived in Nanjing

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] Archbishop Cai Ning, the Vatican's representative to China, and Lu Yian, the new director of the Nanjing office, arrived in Nanjing at 4:00 PM on the 29th. They then met with priests and church members and gave a speech, briefly stating: This is his third visit to Nanjing. He is especially pleased to be in China at the time of its victory and return to its capital. He also said: Since the government moved its capital to Chongqing, he has not come here after Bishop Yu Bin left Nanjing, because the puppet government of Wang Jingwei is not something that we can recognize.

### National Federation of Commerce and Industry Preparatory Committee Meeting Rescheduled to Early Next Month

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] The enlarged preparatory meeting of the National Federation of Commerce and Industry was originally scheduled to be held in Nanjing on April 28. Because the date of the return of the capital is approaching, the meeting should be held after the return of the capital, as the Federation is composed of national vocational groups. It was decided to postpone the meeting to the 8th of next month. In addition, Lin Nengzheng, the representative from Taiwan who will attend the meeting, has arrived in Nanjing. Lin is the first representative of the people from Taiwan to come to Nanjing since Taiwan's restoration. When our newspaper reporter recently interviewed Mr. Lin, he said that the biggest difficulty in Taiwan at present is the transportation problem. Due to the inconvenience of transportation, contact with the motherland is reduced, resulting in a sense of separation. Taiwan suffered a typhoon disaster last year and a drought this year, so there is a severe shortage of food. The price of rice once rose to 20 Taiwanese dollars per catty. After the efforts of the Food Adjustment Committee, it has now returned to 18 yuan per catty. Now, the 6 million people of Taiwan are all rejoicing at returning to the motherland and are working hard to learn the national language so as to accept the culture of the motherland.

### Total Number of Chinese Rickshaw Pullers Exceeds 100,000; Livelihood More Important Than Humanity

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 29th] The municipal authorities here have a plan to abolish rickshaws in consideration of humanity, which has caused extreme panic among rickshaw pullers and owners. They recently jointly hosted reporters, saying that livelihood is more important than humanity. Currently, more than 100,000 people in Wuhan rely on rickshaws for a living. If their livelihoods are lost, it will inevitably lead to a tragedy.

### Ma Zhanshan Waiting for Orders to Enter Manchuria; Granted an Exclusive Interview by Our Newspaper in Beiping, Willing to Serve the Country Despite His Old Age

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 29th] Ma Zhanshan (see photo) is currently staying in Beiping waiting for orders to go to Manchuria. Currently, the two divisions of his former command in Datong have been handed over to He Yuding and reorganized into one army under He's command. He is adamant about resigning from his position as deputy commander of the Twelfth War Zone. General Ma gave an exclusive interview to our newspaper reporter at his residence in Beiping yesterday. He said that he had been summoned by Chairman Chiang three times during his trip to Chongqing, who inquired in detail about the situation in Manchuria. The central government plans to send General Ma back to work in Manchuria, but the title has not yet been decided, because all issues in Manchuria must be determined by Marshall and others. Mr. Ma said: After the September 18th Incident, he had a fleeting moment of resistance. After the July 7th Incident, he was deeply grateful for Chairman Chiang's care, which allowed him to fulfill his long-cherished ambition of resisting Japan. He feels very fortunate. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, he deeply wishes to devote his remaining years to serving the country. However, he is humble and incompetent. If he has the opportunity to cooperate with Zhang Zuoxiang, Wan Fulin, Zou Zuohua, Li Du, and Su Bingwen, it will definitely be beneficial to the overall situation in Manchuria. At this point, Mr. Ma added: In the future, it is almost impossible to divide Manchuria, because the strength of the National Government has increased with each passing day during the nine years of the War of Resistance, and the complex environment in Manchuria is well understood by the general public. He believes that the key to the current Manchurian problem is how to prevent the puppet Manchurian army from interfering in the civil war and how to win over the people of Manchuria. He firmly believes that if the government has appropriate policies, the Zhang Xueshi department of the Communist army will lay down their weapons. General Ma is sixty-two years old this year and is in high spirits, no less than when the reporter visited him in northern Shaanxi last year, but he is shorter and fatter, and his wrinkles have increased. He is currently residing in Beiping, quietly waiting for the development of the situation in Manchuria to decide his next move.

### He Guoguang Discusses the Situation of Opium Suppression in Xikang in Chongqing

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 28th] This morning, a reporter interviewed He Guoguang, Director of the Xichang Provisional Headquarters, who arrived in Chongqing yesterday, and talked about the situation of opium suppression in Xikang. He said that the government has long been determined to implement the opium suppression policy. Xikang has a relatively low level of culture, which makes the implementation of this policy difficult. However, after years of continuous efforts, the banning of planting and smoking has gradually approached the ideal stage. Only the area from Ningyuan District to the south, where Han and Yi people live together, has a very low cultural level, which cannot be implemented with a single order. Therefore, the government has decided to adopt other effective measures to promote the ban in these areas. At present, opium seedlings have disappeared in the Han Chinese residential areas of Ningyuan District. In the areas where Han and Yi people live adjacent to each other, they have begun to be eradicated under the supervision of the army, which is expected to be completed in the short term. As for the vicinity of the Daliang Mountains and other places where purely Yi people reside, this is the only obstacle to the implementation of the ban. In order to thoroughly implement the ban, the government is determined to implement it strictly and complete the opium suppression work in the short term.

### Army Motorcade Arrived in Nanjing from Kunming Yesterday

A Journey of Fifteen Hundred Miles

[United Press, Nanjing, 29th] A Chinese Army motorcade, which departed from Kunming and traveled 1,500 miles, arrived in Nanjing today. This is the first Chinese Army motorcade to enter the recovered area. It consists of 240 jeeps and is an advance team from the Kunming Automobile Training School. The school will relocate to Nanjing in its entirety. The first task is to pick up and drop off National Assembly representatives. The motorcade originally planned to complete the entire journey from Kunming to Nanjing in 15 days, but due to insufficient gasoline supplies along the way, it took two months to reach the capital. The Automobile Training School was established in Ramgarh, India, four years ago and was instructed by the U.S. Army. Since this year, it has been under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Military Affairs. Its entire equipment, including 300 trucks, is supplied by the U.S. Since its establishment, it has trained 1,820 officers and 18,128 soldiers. In the future, it will train 2,000 drivers and 400 mechanics per term.

### Taiwanese Compatriots in Thailand Have Not Yet Regained Freedom

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 27th] The 540 Taiwanese compatriots detained in Thailand were deemed enemy Japanese nationals after the British came here and were detained. Now that Taiwan has returned to China, their status has also changed. The delegation led by Li Tiezheng mentioned the issue of their release two days ago, but the British authorities here said that they must consult the Southeast Asia Allied Headquarters in Singapore. The crux of the matter is that although our government has regarded them as compatriots, other Allied governments still regard them as Japanese. It seems that our government should promptly draw the attention of the Allied governments through diplomatic channels.

Editorial

### Welcoming Special Envoy Hoover to China

Former U.S. President Herbert Hoover, in order to investigate the world's food crisis, will be flying to China from the Philippines today and is expected to arrive in Shanghai this afternoon. Mr. Hoover's visit to the East is in his capacity as Chairman of the American Emergency Relief Committee and as President Truman's special envoy for food, to study the world's food situation. Mr. Hoover is particularly well-suited for this task. After World War I, Mr. Hoover made indelible contributions to alleviating the food crisis in Europe. Twenty years later, after another great war, Mr. Hoover, despite his advanced age, tirelessly travels the globe to study and solve the food crisis, and his compassionate heart is truly admirable. China, in particular, has a deep understanding and friendship between the Chinese people and this outstanding leader. Mr. Hoover resided in China for a period in the past. This time, he returns to this familiar land, but the Far East is no longer what it was. China has emerged victorious from eight years of long and arduous war. The wounds are deep, and the scars have not yet healed. All efforts for post-war relief and rehabilitation still need to be actively launched. Mr. Hoover's arrival at this juncture, we respectfully express our heartfelt welcome to this outstanding statesman!

Speaking of the food crisis, China has suffered a severe food shortage due to the protracted war, the reduction of manpower, the devastation of farmland, the destruction of transportation, and the decline in agricultural production. This is an inevitable result of war. "A year of famine always follows a great war" is common knowledge. Even in peacetime, China, despite being called an agricultural country, still relies on imports of agricultural products from abroad. A review of the import figures for rice and wheat in the customs records will reveal the truth. Moreover, after eight years of bloody war, all of China's grain-producing areas, except for Sichuan Province, have been battlefields. The severity of China's current food crisis is self-evident. Although Minister of Food Xu still claims that food is available everywhere to reassure the people, the earnest appeal of Jiang Tingfu, Director of the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, at the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration conference represents the truth. However, while Director Jiang's appeal won sympathy from all parties, the actual results failed to meet China's urgent needs. This time, Mr. Hoover comes to China as a special envoy for food, and we firmly believe that he will quickly develop relief measures with the concept of treating disaster as if putting out a fire to address China's current food crisis.

Here, we would like to frankly offer a few heartfelt words to Special Envoy Hoover: China has resisted the longest and, fortunately, won the victory through international cooperation. We are especially grateful to the United States. This year, China must overcome famine, viewing famine as no less than the enemy of the past! Overcoming famine is as difficult as the previous war of resistance, requiring full international cooperation, and placing particular hope in the Allied nation of the United States, which has the power to provide relief. China normally purchases a large amount of grain from Siam (Thailand) and Vietnam every year. However, after the war, the surplus grain in both places has been monopolized by Britain and France, blocking the route for its transportation to China. This forces grain-deficient provinces and cities in China, such as Guangdong, Guangxi, and Shanghai, to buy rice from the impoverished inland, instead of purchasing surplus grain from Siam and Vietnam as in previous years, which is truly unreasonable. As a wartime ally, we certainly have the right to demand this from the Allies, and we have even more right to ask the U.S. food envoy to uphold justice and first help break this unreasonable monopoly. We wish the government and society to fully present the reality of China's food crisis to Special Envoy Hoover, without hiding anything. We further pray that Special Envoy Hoover's compassionate and great relief mission will be successful!

### Principal Japanese War Crimes Are Obvious; Formal Indictment Is Filed; Tojo and 27 Others Will Face Justice; Preliminary Hearing Set for the Third of Next Month

[Our Tokyo Correspondent, 29th] The chief prosecutor of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, Keenan, today submitted the indictment of 28 major Japanese war criminals to Presiding Judge Webb. According to Whiteley, the secretary-general of the court, the initial hearing for Hideki Tojo, the Japanese Prime Minister who launched the attack on Pearl Harbor, and other major suspected ringleaders, is scheduled to begin at 10:30 AM on May 3rd. The prosecutor will read the indictment, and the defendants will decide whether to admit the facts of the indictment. The formal trial will then begin in early June. Court officials and Chief Prosecutor Keenan met at the former site of the Japanese Ministry of the Army for 35 minutes this morning. U.S. Navy Captain Coleman will lead the defense of the defendants and was also summoned to attend the meeting today. This reporter interviewed Judge Mei Ruao of our country, who stated exclusively to this reporter: "Although the duty of this court is to try the major war criminals, we will not allow other notoriously wicked Japanese military and politicians who are not included in this indictment to go unpunished. As MacArthur stated in his directive of January 19: The Allied nations will continue their work of trying Japanese war criminals as usual."

[United Press, Tokyo, 29th] International Military Tribunal prosecutor Keenan issued a statement today, saying that the indictment of Japanese war criminals is based on the violation of international law, whether it is formed by custom or established by treaty. The responsibility is not limited to the lower-level personnel who actually committed the crime, but also to those who hold high positions and decide on this action. According to the charter of the International Military Tribunal, the cases are divided into three categories: crimes against peace, customary war crimes, and crimes against humanity. However, the legal basis for each count is the same. The time has come to implement the legal principle that those in high positions are responsible for their actions. The destruction of international public law is due to the decisions of these people. The indictment does not include any new laws.

The counts in each case are restated in accordance with the charter of the International Military Tribunal. Regarding the second category of crimes, they are also stipulated by the domestic laws of various countries and Japanese law. The first category of crimes is stipulated in Article 5, paragraphs A and B of the charter of the International Military Tribunal, which refers to both aggressive war and violations of international public law. In terms of the facts of this case, this distinction is irrelevant. Count 5 of the indictment is the conspiracy to launch such a war. The first count generally refers to the entire plan as a conspiracy, and the remaining four counts elaborate on it separately. Counts 6 to 17 accuse the defendants of planning and preparing to launch such a war against each country separately. Counts 18 to 26 accuse the defendants of initiating this war against several parties. Counts 27 to 36 accuse them individually of engaging in war against several parties. The second category of crimes is accused of murder in accordance with the articles of Article 5 of the charter. Every civilized country stipulates that intentional homicide without legal basis is murder, as does Japanese law. That country's law does not even require the word "intentional." According to the laws of war, a legitimate belligerent is justified in fighting for defense. However, Counts 37 and 38 of the indictment point out that Japan's belligerent status is not legitimate because it violates treaties and is aggressive. Count 37 points out that it did not declare war, and Count 38 points out that it violated treaties prohibiting such aggression. Counts 39 and 43 point out examples of murders committed during the attacks on December 7th and 8th, 1941. Count 44 points out the conspiracy to carry out or allow large-scale murders of prisoners of war and civilians by land and sea. Counts 45 to 50 specifically point out the famous massacres, such as those in Nanjing and other places. Keenan concluded by saying: "If any names are omitted from the indictment, it does not imply that those individuals will be exempt from their conspiracy crimes or that they will not be prosecuted in the future. This must be clearly understood. For the convenience and clarity of prosecuting this case, the number of defendants must be limited in this trial. Most of the principal offenders have already died, but those listed in the indictment who are still alive are, according to the existing evidence, the main responsible parties for the crimes committed by Japan."

Therefore, during this week's meeting to discuss various issues, the interests between the Soviet Union and the United States and Britain will inevitably be involved. It is reported that today's meeting will discuss the issue of revising the French-Italian border.

### Contents of Indictment Against Tojo and Others: Listing Fifty-Five Counts of Crimes; Nature of the Indictment Equivalent to an Accusation of Conspiracy

[United Press, Tokyo, 29th] The United Nations today formally indicted Tojo Hideki and twenty-seven other members of the "militaristic clique," listing fifty-five counts of crimes. The homicides committed in Pearl Harbor, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and the Philippines are particularly emphasized. The nature of the indictment is equivalent to an accusation of conspiracy, in which Japan colluded with the masterminds of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy to seize and usurp the rest of the world. The indictment was filed by the United Nations Chief Prosecutor Keenan at the United Nations Tribunal, located at the somber former Army Ministry building, where the trial will also be held in the future, around 11 AM this morning. The actual indictment is expected to proceed within days, after which the defendants will be given adequate time to prepare their defense. The indictment accuses the Japanese military and their civilian cohorts of initiating wars against eleven plaintiff countries, primarily for initiating a world conspiracy, and also for violating the conventions of war, and abusing and murdering confined enemy nationals and prisoners of war. Tojo is listed as the first defendant, along with some members of his cabinet at the time of the Pearl Harbor attack. Also included are Admiral Nagano, the Chief of Staff of the Navy who initiated the war, and Doihara, the mastermind of the Mukden Incident. The charges also mention plots to wage war against the Soviet Union and various acts of aggression against the Soviet Union in the years before the Pacific War. Had the Soviet Union not demonstrated "strong strength" during the war against Germany, Japan would have seized the opportunity to attack them from behind.

Case History Traced Back to the "September 18th" Incident; Charges Divided into Three Categories

Judging from the list of defendants and their crimes, the case will trace back to the time of the September 18th Mukden Incident. The charges also include the Japanese army's use of poison gas in China and the use of opium to poison the Chinese nation and weaken their will to resist. Keenan also stated that, according to MacArthur's declaration of January 19th this year, the charges should be divided into three categories: crimes against peace, conventional war crimes, and crimes against humanity. Therefore, the scope of the charges ranges from conspiracy to control the world to the abuse of prisoners of war, encompassing everything. The indictment continues: the minds of the Japanese people were systematically poisoned by the harmful notion that the Japanese race was superior to other races in Asia and even the entire world. The Japanese parliamentary system was merely a tool used to implement large-scale aggression, similar to the systems established by Hitler and the Nazi Party in Germany and the Fascist Party in Italy at the time. Japan's economic and financial resources were also mobilized on a large scale to serve aggressive warfare, to the detriment of the welfare of the Japanese people.

Interior Minister Kido Also Accused; Matsui and Others Included

Former Minister of the Imperial Household Kido, one of the most powerful civilian officials in Japan, is also listed as a defendant. Other defendants include four former prime ministers, two former foreign ministers, several former ambassadors, and senior generals from the army and navy of the pre-war militaristic group. The three main architects of the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy, namely former Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke, former Ambassador to Germany Oshima, and former Ambassador to Italy Shiratori Toshio, are also included. In addition to Tojo, the former prime ministers also include Hiranuma, Hirota, and Koiso. Former Foreign Minister Shigemitsu and Umezu, who signed the surrender document, are also on the list. Among the senior naval commanders, in addition to Nakano, there is also Shimada, the Minister of the Navy in Tojo's cabinet. Also included are General Doihara, General Matsui, the commander of the former China Expeditionary Army and the protagonist of the Nanjing Massacre, and Hashimoto, the protagonist of the 1937 shelling of the U.S. gunboat Panay and the British gunboat Ladybird on the Yangtze River.

Attempting to Gain Dominance over the Entire World; Countless Crimes

Regarding the conspiracy portion of the indictment, it states that these Japanese individuals colluded with Germany and Italy to attempt to gain military, naval, political, and economic dominance over the entire world, each with its special dominance within its sphere of influence. Each defendant shall be responsible for all actions taken by himself and anyone executing his orders. These individuals used their powers and positions, as well as their personal prestige and influence, to implement the following policies to advance the conspiracy of domination: illegally seizing manpower and resources from occupied countries, plundering public and private property, and wantonly destroying cities and villages beyond the scope of military necessity. These individuals also engaged in continuous large-scale murders, rapes, pillages, robberies, tortures, and other barbaric acts against helpless civilians in the occupied countries. The army and navy groups increased their power and control over the officials and institutions of the Japanese government, established companies to teach nationalistic policies, disseminated war propaganda, and strictly controlled newspapers and radio stations, in order to psychologically prepare Japanese public opinion for aggressive warfare, establish puppet regimes in occupied countries, conclude military alliances with Germany and Italy, and use force to advance Japan's expansion plans. All of these points are, in fact, the entire history of Japan's quest for world power, and the various methods by which it drove its people to engage in war will become clear during the trial.

General Staff Preparing to Invade the Soviet Union Since 1928

The introduction to the indictment states that the Japanese military clique had systematically mobilized its people, driving them to war and suppressing their rights and the parliamentary system. The Japanese General Staff had been preparing plans for aggressive war against the Soviet Union since 1928, eagerly awaiting an opportunity to take advantage and launch the war. An important preparatory step was the occupation of Manchuria, and Korea also became a military base for attacking the Soviet Union. The railways and highways built in Manchuria after 1931 all had significant military strategic significance. The strength of the Kwantung Army increased from only two divisions in 1931 to fifteen divisions in 1941. Japan also established airfields and barracks in various ports for the purpose of aggressive war against the Soviet Union. The anti-Soviet sentiment of the White Russians was also in preparation for conflict. Japan also systematically created armed conflicts on the border and engaged in conspiracy, sabotage, and terrorist activities on the Middle East Railway. Other crimes include: 1932 - Opposing the Soviet Union's proposed non-aggression pact; 1937 - Attacking Hasan-Sutyr Lake; 1939 - Crossing the Halingol River to attack the Mongolian People's Republic. When the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy was established in Berlin, Matsuoka told the Soviet Ambassador to Germany that if Germany called for assistance, Japan would fight alongside the Nazis without hesitation.

Respect for the Open Door Policy Still in the Air, the Invasion of China Followed

The indictment also reviews the background of the Japanese-American War, believing that the relations between the United States and Japan deteriorated between 1931 and December 1941, due to Japan's aggression in East Asia and its duplicity in diplomatic negotiations, which affected the United States, the Philippines, and the British Empire. Japan launched an aggressive war against China after assuring Britain and the United States that it had "no territorial ambitions in China" and would respect the Open Door Policy.

### Fierce Quarrel at the Rice Market with Questions Raised, Chairs Upset, and Tables Turned; Minister of Food Convenes Meeting, Decides to Surrender Seventeen Merchant's Rice for Market Adjustment

[Report from this newspaper] Recently, the price of rice has soared, causing widespread panic. Yesterday morning, a dispute erupted at the Qingjian Pavilion Rice Market, and the market did not open. Around 9 AM yesterday, rice merchants, because it was Sunday and their stock was low, demanded rice from the seventeen rice merchants who had previously borrowed 100,000,000 yuan in rice loans and had, in fact, received several batches of rice in Shanghai. One of the responsible persons of these seventeen rice merchants, Mr. Wu, was accused by the crowd of deliberately shirking his responsibilities. As a result, the crowd questioned him fiercely, and the atmosphere became extremely tense, with chairs and tables overturned. Mr. Wu was escorted out of the market by four policemen. Prior to yesterday, the general expectation was that the price of rice would fall slightly yesterday. Unexpectedly, this incident occurred, making the market situation uncontrollable and causing new highs of 48,000 and 50,000 or more.

After yesterday's dispute, trading immediately stopped. Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau immediately telegraphed Xing Zhigang, the person in charge of the market, and the standing members of the Rice Industry Association to the bureau to discuss the matter and mediate. Subsequently, Qu Zhenhua, a standing member of the Rice Industry Association, rushed back to the market to persuade the crowd and decided on the spot to go to the office of the Food Commissioner in the afternoon to request that the rice purchased with the rice loans be entirely handed over to the association for equal distribution among the rice merchants for market supply. At that time, the representatives of the rice merchants expressed many opinions, which can be summarized as follows: (1) If the authorities recover the rice loans, the price of rice can be immediately brought down. (2) The original intention of holding the rice loan program was for the central government to show concern for the people, but the distribution was not well managed, and it actually stimulated the market price. It would be better to use this money to carry out a price stabilization program directly. (3) Thoroughly investigate the actual amount of rice purchased by these seventeen rice merchants. Most rice merchants told reporters that they knew that the price of rice in the countryside was only around 25,000 when the rice loans were issued. Small rice shops and merchants dared not hoard too much stock due to capital turnover, so the market price was relatively stable in the previous period. After the rice loans were issued, some merchants inevitably took this opportunity to hoard goods and not sell, thereby raising prices and profiting from it. On the one hand, small rice shops had no goods to supply the market and were criticized by the citizens. On the other hand, they could not replenish their stock, suffering unbearable losses and being caught in a dilemma.

In the afternoon, the reporter went to the office of the Food Affairs Commissioner again and met Mr. Wan Molin, who expressed regret over the poor order in the rice market. At the same time, the person in charge of the office of the Food Affairs Commissioner told reporters that the original intention of holding this rice loan program was to increase the source of rice supply, and the government handled it with great seriousness. However, the total number of large and small rice shops in Shanghai currently reaches more than 2,500, and the total number of rice merchants reaches more than 200, so it is impossible to lend money without any selection. Therefore, the qualification verification of these seventeen rice merchants was also very cautious, and Mr. Xu Jilou's opinion was sought in advance.

Minister of Food Xu specially convened a meeting around 5 PM in the afternoon, attended by Xu Jilou, Wu Kaixian, Wan Molin, and others. The meeting lasted for three hours, and around 8 PM, they further visited President Song for instructions. The final decision was that all the rice purchased by these seventeen rice merchants should be handed over to the office of the Food Affairs Commissioner first, and the office would be responsible for selling and adjusting the market at any time, depending on the situation. As for the rumors that the authorities had decided on two kinds of rice prices, 38,500 yuan and 37,500 yuan per dan, the authorities in the Shanghai rice industry have officially denied them. The market will legally resume this morning. According to observations by people in the industry, the price of rice will definitely fall today, because there is a surge of rice arriving in Shanghai, with more than 10,000 piculs arriving at the port yesterday.

Yesterday morning, President Song summoned Minister of Food Xu and received Omdahl, the person in charge of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), to discuss the rising rice prices. It is said that a decision has been made to plan ships so that 240,000 tons of foreign rice from abroad can be transported to China as soon as possible. The Rice Market Management Committee also convened an emergency meeting of rice merchants, resolving to do their best to stabilize rice prices, prohibit speculation, and strictly prohibit those who do not wear badges from entering the market for trading.

### Former Chiefs and Other Pseudo-Officials: Zhou Yuying on Trial Yesterday Denies Being Chief Representative at the Literary Congress, Felt Like Being Driven Around "Like a Dog"

[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhou Yuying, a native of Liyang, 43 years old, residing at No. 12, Lane 542, Baike Road. Previously worked in the Central Party Headquarters of the Chinese Kuomintang. In the spring of the 30th year of the Republic (1941), through the recommendation of traitor Ding Mocun, he joined the puppet government, serving as a specialist member of the Social Enterprise Committee of the puppet Central Political Committee, and as the director of the Translation Committee of the puppet Ministry of Social Affairs and the Ministry of Transportation, editing public bulletins and engaging in enemy propaganda. He also attended the pseudo Greater East Asia Literary Congress in Japan under the guise of a chief representative. In the spring of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), he was reassigned as Director of the General Affairs Department of the puppet Ministry of Social Welfare and Director of the Population Administration, among other positions. In the summer of the same year, he came to Shanghai, serving as the Director of the Shanghai Office of the puppet Ministry of Social Welfare, and the Director of the Promotion Department of the puppet Chinese Social Enterprise Association. In the autumn of the following year, he was again reassigned as the Director of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Social Welfare Bureau.

After the victory of the War of Resistance, he was arrested by the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission and transferred to the High Procuratorate for investigation. He was subsequently prosecuted under Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. The case was heard at the Provisional Criminal Court of the High Court at ten o'clock yesterday morning. The defendant was dressed in a black serge long robe and black leather shoes. His face was full, and he still retained his former demeanor. When questioned by Judge Cao Jun, Zhou remained composed and confessed without reservation to all the pseudo-official positions he had held as accused by the prosecutor. However, regarding the attendance at the pseudo Greater East Asia Literary Congress, he denied ever serving as the chief representative. According to him, his attendance at the conference was entirely the result of a "kidnapping-style" invitation from the pseudo Central Propaganda Department and the enemy's embassy in the puppet government, with Zhou Huarun serving as the head of the delegation and Qian Fusun as the deputy. He himself did not understand Japanese and was unwilling to talk much with his fellow travelers, so he did not know where he was going or what cities he was visiting. He said that it felt "completely like being driven around like a dog," with no enjoyment whatsoever.

He has already drafted a lengthy defense statement of over ten thousand words while in prison, which he read aloud in court. The main points were: (1) He originally met traitor Ding at the Xinguang Bookstore, and only saw him again due to debt collection. Joining the puppet government was only intended to influence Ding for good. (2) He engaged in social welfare to serve the poor. (3) During his tenure in the pseudo-official position, he sowed discord between the enemy and the puppets. (4) He did not engage in propaganda for the enemy. Finally, he requested to meet with journalists and submit his manuscript for review, which was not granted by the court. The news稿 (manuscript) was also retained by the judge. In conclusion, he indirectly stated three points: (1) Traitors should be killed. (2) This case is a miscarriage of justice. (3) He appealed to the press to uphold justice. Judge Cao ruled that the case required further investigation and ordered a postponement for further hearing.

Jiang Guozhang, a native of Wuxi, 35 years old, residing at No. 50, Lane 1285, Avenue Joffre, previously assisted his father in operating the Hongxing Iron Company at No. 883, Suzhou Road, Shanghai. Later, he raised funds himself to establish the Lian Da Iron Company on Zhejiang Road. In April of the 31st year of the Republic (1942), he further combined with foreign investment to establish the Shanghai Iron Manufacturing Factory at No. 214, Lane 614, Rue Robert, serving as its manager. He produced three tons of round and strip steel per day, which was used for military construction by the enemy. However, according to Jiang's statement, all that he produced was supplied to local handicraft industries and was never used to资 (aid). Judge Cao ruled that the case required further investigation and ordered a postponement for further hearing.

Zhang Yuting, a Shanghai native, 28 years old, a farmer, residing in Jiangwan, with no family property. He formerly served as a staff officer and inspector in the puppet Shanghai Municipal Security Command. After an inquiry, the hearing was postponed.

Wang Zuying and Others Scheduled for Sentencing. Those whose cases were heard in the afternoon included Wang Zuying, a member of the detective squad of the puppet police bureau, Li Wenhan, a tax inspector of the puppet customs, Wang Deqing, a laborer of the puppet Central China Transportation Company, and Zhang Zhiyou and Wu Jiaqi, organizers of the puppet "rickshaw association." Zhang Jinming, et al. Relying on the power of the enemy and the puppets, they oppressed and arrested innocent people. After Presiding Judge Liu Yugui, together with Judge Cao Jun and others, convened a collegiate panel and interrogated them one by one, the appointed defense attorney, Chen Zhen, made a plea, raising two points: (1) The pseudo-official positions held were extremely minor, and (2) they were forced to do so out of necessity for survival. Therefore, he requested the court to show leniency. The court ordered sentencing at 2:00 PM on May 6.

### Li Ze Questioned This Afternoon

(Our Newspaper's Report) The case of Li Ze, the general manager of the New-Asia Company, which has been delayed for a long time, will be continued to be heard at the High Court at 2:30 PM today. Yesterday, Chen Tingrui, Li Ze's defense lawyer, told reporters: The reason why Li Ze's case has been delayed until now is that the High Court wants to seriously investigate the evidence submitted. However, the New-Asia Company employees who reported the case stated: The High Court ordered the accusers to investigate Li Ze's assets, but after the report was submitted, it has not been seized, which they find very incomprehensible. The case will be heard by a collegiate panel today, and both sides may submit further evidence. If the debate can be concluded today, the date of sentencing may be within the next week. Moreover, the puppet officials Liang Hongzhi, Zhou Bangjun, Zhu Boquan, Xu Weizhen, Guo Jianhong, etc., were brought out from prison by the High Procuratorate for investigation yesterday.

### Disabled Veterans Receive Lifetime Preferential Treatment. Deputy Director of Veteran Affairs Reports on Current Situation of Veterans

Yesterday afternoon, the Veteran Affairs Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs, in order to clarify the current situation of veterans to the outside world, specially invited the press, with Deputy Director Yu Shoumei of the Department providing a detailed explanation.

The Government Treats Veterans Fairly

He said: In good conscience, the government treats veterans fairly. From Chairman Chiang and Minister Chen onwards, everyone has been very concerned about this matter. For example, soldiers who are injured receive a one-grade salary increase, and a considerable amount of the military expenditure, which accounts for 70% of the total national budget, is used for the resettlement of veterans. Although the Chinese government is poor, it will do its best to solve this problem. In the past, the government not only forbade veterans from being destitute but also forced them to be accommodated. Now the government has established ten educational and rehabilitation institutions, twenty temporary educational and rehabilitation institutions, and eleven sanatoriums across the country to accommodate veterans with various degrees of disability. According to the report statistics prepared on April 11 of this year, there are a total of 63,860 veterans in the country, of which 2,708 have recovered and about 3,600 to 5,000 are disabled.

Resettlement Measures to be Implemented

The government has recently formulated a plan on how to resettle these veterans, which has been approved by Chairman Chiang for implementation. This method can be divided into: (1) Those who are completely disabled and have no home will be given lifelong preferential treatment and care in the five to eight educational and rehabilitation institutions that the government plans to set up in each region. However, since this is a social welfare undertaking, it will be taken over by the Ministry of Social Affairs in the future. (2) Those who are disabled but not completely disabled can be divided into two categories for treatment: One, those who have a home to return to should be sent back as much as possible, provided with travel expenses and transportation, and given a living allowance or taught farming. Two, those who have no home to return to can be handled in several ways: or collectively assigned land, contact the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to reclaim wasteland in the interior. Among them, 5,000 to 6,000 military officers will be given retraining according to their educational level, degree of disability, and interests, and soldiers will be given industrial training to participate in work in factories designated by the Ministry of Social Affairs. In addition, the government is also considering adopting the social insurance methods of European and American countries to protect their occupations.

An Important Issue Concerning Future Public Morale

In short, the resettlement of veterans is an important issue because it concerns society, the country, and even more so future public morale. If the government does not handle it well, it will also be unfair to them. The defined veterans are soldiers who were disabled due to injuries during the War of Resistance. Those who have recovered after being injured are not included and must return to their units to continue serving. Speaking of Wang Changxi, he said, "The government has ordered him to go back and ordered him to submit the accounts of past fundraising because the government did not ask him to fundraise, and the government has its own way to help veterans."

Yuasa Torakichi, on trial, later had Jiang Pingfan appointed as his public defender.

### Japanese War Criminal on Trial for Repeatedly Abusing and Killing Our Captured Soldiers, Yuasa Torakichi's Crimes Are Obvious

The first war criminal on trial was Yuasa Torakichi, who, while serving as the manager of the Japanese Army's South Shanghai Prisoner of War Camp, embezzled military rations and killed as many as seven or eight of our captured soldiers. Yesterday, facing the huge national flag hanging behind the wall of our military court, he trembled in fear, reaping the consequences of his evil deeds. Before our glorious national emblem, this despicable criminal looked even more ugly. Throughout the trial, the most elite Third Independent Battalion of our country's military police was responsible for security, and the order was well-maintained and quiet. The judges were all in military uniform and wearing swords, showing great dignity. The Central Photography Studio specially sent a commissioner to make a film to commemorate this heartening scene forever.

Prosecutor Lin Reads Indictment. Yuasa was brought from the Tilanqiao Detention Center to the waiting room for questioning at 1:30 PM. At this time, the audience seats were already full. At 2:00 PM sharp, Military Tribunal Presiding Judge Liu Shifang, Judges Qu Cengze, Lu Qi, Jiang Baoli, Jiang Baolian, Prosecutor Lin Wopeng, Clerk Feng Junyue, Translator Luo Jing, and Public Defender Jiang Pingfan, et al. arrived at the court one after another and took their seats in order. First, Clerk Feng stood up and announced the opening of the case of war criminal suspect Yuasa Torakichi. Then, the court attendant brought Yuasa into the court. After the presiding judge inquired about his name, age, origin, and occupation, Prosecutor Lin stood up and read the indictment. It roughly stated: Several hundred officers and soldiers of the 27th Army of our country were captured in the Battle of Taiyangshan. In April of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), they were transported by the Japanese army to the camp for detention, and in April they were under the jurisdiction of the defendant. Yuasa was cruel and violent, often embezzling food and beating prisoners. He also participated in the killing of Su Taikui and seven or eight others. After the Japanese surrendered, the defendant mixed into the overseas Chinese community and lived in hiding. On November 7 of last year, he was encountered by former captured soldiers Jiang Banren et al., who handed him over to the military police. He was sent to this court by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. The defendant's acts of abusing prisoners violated Article 38 and Article 73 of the Criminal Law of the Chinese Army, Navy, and Air Force, Article 271 of the General Criminal Law, Article 1 and Article 2 of the War Criminals Trial Regulations, Article 10 of the Implementing Rules of the same Regulations, and Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

Witnesses Testify to the Crimes in Court. After being translated by the translator, Judge Liu began the trial. Yuasa denied each and every point in the indictment and claimed that it was a kind of speculation, hoping for a more detailed investigation. He continued that his job as a manager was under the command of the warden, and his usual job was to direct prisoners to transport coal and other goods. The prisoners' working hours were not fixed and depended on the amount of goods. The average was six hours a day. Food was regulated, but it was not under his control. (Question) Did the soldiers say you beat them? (Answer) Because they stole things. (Question) How many people did you beat? (Answer) I don't often beat people, I don't remember. (Question) What did you use to beat them? (Answer) I used my hands to slap their faces because if I didn't beat them, the guards would beat them even more severely. (Question) Did they say you killed several people? (Answer) That's not the case. (Question) Did you say you killed Su Taikui? (Answer) No. (Question) Where did you beat people? (Answer) During transportation, at the camp or on the pier, it wasn't fixed. At this point, the court summoned eight witnesses, Ouyang Chen, Jiang Zhenren, Chen Mingde, and Yu Shixing, to testify in court about the torture in the prisoner of war camp, such as waterboarding, electric shocks, bayonet practice, and driving military dogs to bite, and witnessed him participating in the killing of Major Yao Shouqing, Captain Qian Shoufu, Lieutenant Gao Guangming, Li Zhizhong, Fan Wending, Sergeant Wang Jingxian, Su Taikui, and others, as well as the address where the bodies of the victims were buried. When questioned, Yuasa still replied. I did not have this kind of barbaric action. The bodies were actually those of prisoners who died of lung disease.

Pending Further Investigation, Rescheduled for Another Hearing. At this point, the court asked the defendant if he had any other favorable evidence to provide. He was silent. Finally, public defender Jiang Pingfan stood up and stated: The execution matters in the camp were the responsibility of the guard captain, Kinei Sato, and the food management was the responsibility of Kiyoo Kihara. Please summon them to court. At 4:40 PM, the court ordered that the case was still pending investigation and rescheduled the hearing, and the defendant was remanded in custody.

Yuasa Torakichi is 37 years old, from Kii County, Japan, a primary school graduate. He came to China in the 30th year of the Republic (1941) and worked as a clerk in a candy store opened by口人 (Japanese) in Xuzhou and Hongkou, Shanghai. In August of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), he entered the South Shanghai Prisoner of War Camp as a manager until the surrender. The criminal is short in stature and was wearing a Chinese-style white cotton short shirt and pants and black running shoes yesterday.

### Bloody Incident Occurs in Zhoujiadu South, Small Owner of Grocery Store Kills Elderly Neighbor in Moment of Anger, Father Injured While Trying to Intervene, Suspect Attempts Suicide Out of Fear of Punishment but Fails

Yesterday afternoon at around 6:00 PM, Tang Yisan, the young owner of the Tang Longxing grocery store in Caojiazhai Ferry, Zhoujiadu South, four or so li away, became angry while worshiping gods in a nearby temple and threw the sacrificial offerings (pig, sheep, chicken meat) into the river. A neighbor, Hu Jijui, 72 years old, greedy for petty gains, was just retrieving the offerings to cook and eat them at home when Yisan found out. Yisan went home and grabbed two cleavers, chasing and hacking at Jijui wildly, with his head and arms falling off, and his chest and abdomen also being chopped up, bones broken and exposed, a gruesome death. His father, Tang Jinkuan, horrified to see his son killing someone with a knife, stepped forward to hug him and shouted, "Kill me first if you want to kill," resulting in him also being slashed six times. Fortunately, the injuries were not critical, and his life is not in danger. Yisan, seeing the situation escalate and unable to escape the law, jumped into the river, hoping to float across to escape. At that time, Section Chief Pan of the local police station had already arrived and ordered two policemen to fire several shots, and Tang Yisan began to come ashore and was arrested. However, he had also suffered severe knife wounds to his head and chest, presumably self-inflicted out of fear of punishment, and his condition was quite dangerous. He was later sent to Shanghai Renji Hospital for treatment and will be brought back for questioning after he recovers.

### City Councilors Complete Universal Election, Ballot Counting Progresses in Various Districts Under Police and Security Corps Protection, Pan Gongzhan, Wu Shaoshu, and Xu Xueyu Are All Elected, Results of Several Districts Not Yet Announced Due to Incomplete Procedures

(Our Newspaper's Report) After the completion of the universal election a few days ago, the ballots from the various polling places in this city were sealed and concentrated in the district public offices. Starting at 9:00 AM yesterday, the various district public offices held ballot counting under the assembly of the ballot counting presiding officer, election supervisors, monitors, ballot counters, vote callers, and various candidates. Among them, except for the Ninth District (Changning District) and the Nineteenth District (Jianlin District), which decided to re-elect due to disputes; and the Sixteenth District (Hongkou District), which needed to concentrate the ballot boxes in the municipal government for ballot counting for some reason, the other districts successively counted ballots.

When the various district public offices counted ballots, they were protected by police and members of the city security corps, and the security was strict, so the general ballot counting situation was good. Mayor Qian and Deputy Director Xiang Changquan of the Civil Affairs Department personally went to various district public offices to inspect and provide instructions and explanations for the doubts that arose during the ballot counting in various districts.

### News Outside the News - London

— Special Correspondent Xue Yan from London, 18th [of the month] Airmail

Government's Most Confusing Replies

In England, when people have matters to inquire about from ministers, ministers are expected to reply. If it is an inquiry from a member of parliament, it is even more necessary to reply. Once a reply has been given, they are subject to questioning. On March 15, many members of parliament raised questions about the slow replies from various departments. It is said that the Secretary of State for War replied the slowest, with an average of six weeks to reply to each letter. The Colonial Office took eight days, the Foreign Office eight days, the Treasury thirteen days, the Home Office twenty-one days, the Admiralty twenty-four days, the Department of Education twenty-one days, the Air Ministry thirty-two days, the Ministry of War Transport thirty-three days, and the Ministry of Health twenty-four days. On behalf of the government, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury replied that the reasons for the slow replies, in addition to the need to consider the questions themselves sometimes, were mainly the lack of manpower and not enough typists. It is hoped that the situation will improve after full restoration. He also said: In addition to replying to letters from members of parliament, government departments also need to reply to letters from the people. It would not be fair to delay replies to ordinary people in order to reply to letters from members of parliament in advance, and it would certainly not be approved by the House of Commons. He said: The War Office needs to reply to 5,000 letters per month, the Air Ministry 4,000 letters per month, and the Ministry of Labor and the Ministry of Health 1,600 letters each per month, so the work of government replies is very heavy.

MP Salaries to Increase to One Thousand Pounds

During the war, prices in England rose threefold, and the worst affected were of course the salaried class. But among the salaried class, workers were better off, as their wage increases were roughly the same as the price increases. Lower-level civil servants were also okay, because the salary standards for lower-level civil servants were more flexible. The minimum salary for actual civil servants has now been raised, so the minimum living standards can still be maintained. Only senior civil servants are relatively the most bitter. Many entertainment expenses related to their positions cannot be saved, and have increased with the high prices. But their income has reached the peak of the statutory salary level and cannot be increased further. By last autumn, they really couldn't bear it anymore, and the members of parliament were the first to ask for a raise, and they discussed it in parliament, and as a result, it was sent to a committee for review (organized by the members of parliament themselves). Now the review has ended, and recently a report was submitted, considering the request reasonable, and the annual salary of members of parliament should be increased from six hundred pounds to one thousand pounds. This bill can become law after it is passed by the parliament in three readings. The salary of British members of parliament was 400 pounds per year in 1911. In 1937, it increased to 600 pounds. This year, it is expected to increase to 1,000 pounds, of which 500 pounds can be exempted from income tax.

Travel Agencies Shoot Promotional Films Britain is now planning to increase its revenue by 400 million US dollars (equivalent to 100 million pounds) per year from tourists traveling to England, starting in 1947. Currently, due to the lack of various materials and the difficulty of transportation, it is naturally difficult to have many tourists traveling to England. But by next spring, it seems that the pre-war state can be restored. The Travel Association of Great Britain is currently planning to shoot eight films to be shown around the world as information to promote the current situation in Britain and stimulate travel interest. At the same time, there is also a film called "The World Seen by the Boys" in preparation. The content is probably to select the best scenery in various autonomous regions, the United States, and other allied countries and all the places where British soldiers have set foot, and intersperse the lives of British soldiers to make a film. It is said that British travel revenue reached 30 million pounds per year before the war, which has long exceeded Switzerland and Italy. It is only second to Canada and France. Before the war, France's annual travel revenue was 80 million pounds, while Canada's was 60 million pounds.

Imported Agricultural Products and Raw Materials

The United States' exports this year are expected to be about 2.5 billion pounds. Of this, 300 million pounds is to be sold to the UK. What are the things that these 300 million pounds want to buy? According to the "Daily Mail," 106 million pounds will be spent on meat, tallow, and poultry. 31 million pounds will be spent on grains, vegetables, fruits, vegetable oils, and beer. 47 million pounds will be spent on synthetic rubber, medicines, seeds, and tobacco. 33 million pounds will be spent on engines, turbines, and various building, transportation, mining, electrical, and industrial machinery. 13 million pounds will be spent on cotton, cotton textiles, rayon, synthetic fibers, and various textiles. 11 million pounds will be spent on wood, cork, wood products, pulp, and paper. 26 million pounds will be spent on petroleum, petroleum by-products, and sulfur. 9 million pounds will be spent on medicines and chemicals, including soaps and cosmetics. The UK is a highly industrialized country, so the products it buys from foreign countries are mostly agricultural products and raw materials, which, after being reprocessed, are still transported and sold abroad.

The Two Princesses' Shadows Often Appear

The current British Emperor has no sons, only two princesses. The eldest princess, Elizabeth, will be the next Queen by rule. To deepen the impression of the British people, publicity has now begun. Ship launches, grand opening ceremonies, etc., are often invited to attend. And in newsreels and photo exhibitions, their shadows can be seen everywhere. The princess is now in her prime, with a graceful demeanor, and the British people look at her with respect and love. Currently, many of the UK's autonomous regions welcome royal visits. The trip to South Africa in February next year has been decided. Canada is also reportedly in discussions. Australia and New Zealand may follow suit, which is also uncertain.

Reasonable Treatment for the Poor

Since the Labour Party came to power, it has been making every effort to promote the nationalization of enterprises. Although the Conservative Party has been constantly attacking and opposing it, there is no doubt that the nationalization plan is popular with the common people. Minister of Health Bevan proposed a plan for the nationalization of medical care on March 22, which will mark a new era in medical history. According to Bevan's plan, from 1938, people in the UK who need medical treatment will not have to spend money. Any person's medical expenses will be borne by the state. The method is to divide the country into 26 districts, each with a health center. A committee will manage local health affairs. The composition of the committee is half representatives elected by doctors, pharmacists, etc., and the other half appointed by local governments and the Ministry of Health. All matters such as the hiring of hospitals and doctors, medical schools, and the management of medical expenses will be managed by it. All qualified doctors can practice medicine everywhere, and their salaries will be paid by the medical center. However, the standard for payment is half a fixed salary, and the other half is determined according to the number and frequency of people they treat. Patients can freely choose a doctor. As long as a doctor proves it, there is no need to pay for hospitalization. However, if doctors do not want to be employed, they can also practice medicine on their own, and patients can of course pay to find a doctor. Therefore, the role of this plan is entirely to guarantee medical care for the common people. Any poor person who gets sick can get reasonable treatment. After this system is implemented, it is believed that very few private doctors will set up their own practices. (April 10, London.)

### The Dual Character of the Soviet Union - Violence - Coordination

— Countries Hold a Skeptical Attitude

Soviet policy seems to be a huge contradiction, but it is not. The Danes were overjoyed when the Red Army began to withdraw from Bornholm. When the Soviet Union stationed troops in Iran, the world suspected that it had the intention of inciting indigenous people to rebel and causing renewed riots in Iran, but the Soviet Union allowed it to withdraw from Iran within six weeks, "if nothing unexpected happens." The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union recently ordered the demobilization of six grades of the Red Army in mid-September.

The day after this order was issued, Moscow Radio commentator Volonin issued a warning, saying that the Soviet Union "is surrounded by capitalist countries and reactionary forces, and their desire to redistribute the world may again cause armed conflict..." China recently happily announced that the Soviet Union had notified China that it would allow the withdrawal from the Northeast on May 1. According to the Canadian government, Soviet spy network members not only received rubles from Moscow, but even received instructions telling them not to take carriages directly to secret meeting places. All of this seems to be contradictory at first glance, but it is not.

Power, Prestige, Security

The Soviet Union's dual character of violence and coordination makes other countries feel puzzled because they always hold a skeptical attitude toward it.

The Soviet Union needs power; the Soviet Union needs prestige; the Soviet Union needs security. The Soviet Union believes that peace is the best opportunity, better than all the opportunities that Tsarist Russia had, and that the Bolsheviks might have in a decade or two.

Last week, Washington rumors said that American officials who stayed in Germany found a blueprint for Moscow's plans in the transcripts of Molotov's talks with Ribbentrop before Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941. Molotov demanded the Baltic states, all of Poland occupied by the Soviet Union, certain areas of Finland, eastern Romania, full control of the Tartar Strait, free disposition of Iran and Iraq, and a portion of Arabia in order to control the Persian Gulf. Ribbentrop thought the Soviet Union was asking for too much.

What is the Soviet Union's Goal?

But the Soviet Union itself believes that its territorial demands are legitimate. Communism believes that it is safest to have its problems treated by itself. In order to seek this security, the Soviet Union has annexed a total of 273,947 square miles of territory since 1939 - an area larger than the US state of Texas. It placed the countries on its borders behind "friendly" (i.e., docile) governments, and now only two exceptional countries, Iran and Turkey, are still under pressure from the sea. In the Soviet Union's view, even Iranian oil is not as important as a puppet regime in Tehran.

The Soviet Union is temporarily satisfied with influencing a small number of people in some other countries (such as France and Italy). Although this small number of people does not have the strong power to control the overall situation, they also have considerable influence to contain what the Soviet Union considers to be redundant policies. In addition, there is a third group of countries (such as India and Spain) that are suffering from communist intrusion, mostly because their current governments have not yet solved urgent political and social problems.

The Soviet Union observes capitalist and socialist countries with suspicious eyes, so the Soviet Union maintains the world's most powerful army (at least six million people). The Soviet Union would rather isolate its own sphere of influence from the rest of the world, and has cut off most of the economic and cultural ties between Eastern Europe and the West. But it is eager to establish closer ties with countries that can help it divide up other forces, and it is now courting the humanitarian Arabs and the fascist Argentinians. The Soviet Union specializes in exploiting the weaknesses of countries around the world.

Participate in International Organizations

The Soviet Union's economic power is expanding into the gaps left by the collapsed German and Japanese industries and trade. Its social system, although opposed to centuries of Western progress, is gaining the favor of hundreds of millions of people around the world. Its political tactics are confident, ruthless, and ever-changing, from military terror to humanitarianism. It uses countless methods, directly and indirectly, and countless groups to complete its mission.

The Soviet Union joins international organizations when it is profitable. For example, it opposed the World Aviation Agreement because it did not want foreign planes to fly over its territory. It did not join the Bretton Woods International Monetary Fund Agreement and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, but it actively participated in the World Federation of Trade Unions.

Principle of Equality of All Countries

But no matter what fears and ambitions the Soviet Union has, it does not need war. Although it has a desire to seize, it is very sensitive to strong and united opposition. The Soviet Union is still weaker than the United States and much weaker than the entire Western world. If the other countries of the world abide by the United Nations Charter, the Soviet Union's desires will not deviate from the norm.

Last week, Stalin suddenly praised the United Nations organization, which the Soviet Union had always opposed: that is, the United Nations organization's emphasis on the principle of equality of all countries and its rejection of the principle of one country dominating other countries. Stalin said that the great future of the United Nations organization depends on the principle of equality. Small nations can again answer with France's irony: "The law is impartial; it prohibits both the poor and the rich from sleeping under bridges, begging on the streets, and stealing bread." But if the Soviet Union cannot fulfill Stalin's promise, then they can also find other words to blame the Soviet Union.

Analysis of the European Political Situation - Drawn by the Newspaper's Reference Room - Due to the chaos during and after the war, the political situation in most European countries is still unstable.

### Severe Spring Famine: No Green Grass in the Fields, Wailing and Starving People in Northern Anhui

— Our Newspaper, 20th Dispatch, Bengbu Correspondent Qian Mengchao

The twenty-three counties in northern Anhui after the catastrophe are like a breached dike, the ruins overgrown with weeds, desolate and lonely. The mountains and rivers of Shou, Huai, Xiu, and Qian cannot conceal the traces of war. The loyal bones along the banks of the Huai River and the desolate tombs on both sides of the Jinpu Railway have written an indelible epic. The counties, once known for producing rice and wheat, are now not only almost emptied of inhabitants in nine out of ten households, but also filled with wailing and starving people, creating a scene too unbearable to witness. During this season when the provinces and cities in the recovered areas are universally suffering from crop failures, the severity of the spring famine in northern Anhui is truly no less than that of Hunan and Guangxi provinces. The situation of the spring famine is described as follows:

Disasters Occur Frequently, Famine Rages Everywhere

The Japanese invaders occupied northern Anhui for seven years and eight months, from the autumn they entrenched themselves until their surrender last autumn. Only Fuyang City managed to remain secure and not be captured. However, the enemy cavalry had already entered the county's territory, only thirty li away from the city. Most of northern Anhui suffered bloody rule during the occupation period. In addition to the enemy and puppet regimes' arbitrary exploitation, there were continuous droughts, locust plagues, and floods. Last year, the Yellow River diverted into the Huai River, causing torrential backflow. The low-lying areas of Fengyang and Wuhe became vast expanses of water, almost turning into swamps. Not only was there no autumn harvest, but many places were unable to sow the winter wheat that should have been planted in August and September last year. There is little doubt that the summer harvest of wheat will be poor this year. Currently, in remote areas, the rural areas are almost completely bankrupt. In Xuyi County, areas like Bangze are as empty as suspended chimes, with no green grass in the fields. If the grain-producing areas near the lake are like this, one can imagine the situation in other barren mountainous areas. Therefore, famine occurs everywhere. There are many places where disaster victims eat tree bark and grass roots to eke out a living.

Forced Purchase of Military Grain: People of Anhui Heartbroken

The War of Resistance was victorious, and the central government was well aware that the people had suffered greatly. Therefore, it specifically ordered the exemption of land taxes for one year in the occupied areas and implemented a 25% rent reduction to benefit poor farmers. The people of northern Anhui were overjoyed by this decree, feeling like they were "full of food and beating their bellies." Unexpectedly, after four or five months, a disguised "forced purchase of military grain" appeared. It was stated that payment would be given, but in some remote counties, it was barely enough to cover the cost of transporting the grain. This is truly a comical tragedy. The grain purchase in Anhui Province is handled strangely. The Ministry of Food gives an agreed-upon price, reportedly 5,500 yuan per shi, but Anhui Province only gives 4,500 yuan. This is then distributed from the provincial government to the counties, and then to the people. After passing through seven or eight levels of county, township, and village chiefs, and the extraction and exploitation of the "tooth-like" middlemen, no one knows how much the people actually receive. The corruption of grain officials is what the people of Anhui resent most. The recent attacks on a certain high official are also one of the reasons. Fortunately, the central government has decided to reorganize the Anhui provincial government, and the people of northern Anhui may have hope for recovery. However, all counties are currently experiencing grain shortages. If prompt and unified relief is not organized and implemented, it will be unimaginable when the season of food scarcity arrives. Therefore, the reporter earnestly hopes that the authorities will immediately find a proper relief method to alleviate the suffering of the compatriots in northern Anhui.

Communist Army Occupies Xuyi, Suffering is Most Severe

Good fortune never comes in pairs, and misfortune never comes alone. The people of northern Anhui, living in extreme hardship, are unfortunately also burdened by the Communist army occupying Xuyi, Wuhe, Sixian, Lingbi, Fengyang, Suxian, Dingyuan, and areas in northern Jiangsu, demanding food on the spot, which further increases the consumption of grain. In addition to levies and quotas, they also forcibly coerce people to cut down telegraph poles, dig up railways, and carry out sabotage work. They even force them to go to the front lines, charge into battle, and become victims under fire.

Taking just Xuyi County as an example, the severity of the disaster is unprecedented in centuries. People are on the brink of starvation, like ants on a hot pot, driven to a dead end. The number of people fleeing to other places has reached more than 30,000. The Xuyi Fellow Villagers Association in Mingguang recently stated that tens of thousands of refugees urgently need relief. In addition to requesting relief from relevant agencies and charitable organizations, they also appealed to people from all walks of life to show sympathy and provide relief. The appeal states: "Before the War of Resistance had even reached the halfway point, the entire territory of Xuyi became a den of bandits, occupied by the Communist army. The county seat was once occupied by the enemy, and the rural areas were still occupied by the Communist army. For eight years, the people have not only had their fields and produce plundered by the Communist army, but countless lives have also been slaughtered. After the victory, after the Japanese invaders withdrew, the red flames spread throughout the county, with robbery and killing heard every day. Conscription of soldiers, demolition of houses to fill the fields, there is no time to rest. Currently, all the able-bodied men in the county, except those conscripted by someone, have all fled. Landlords, gentry, and intellectuals, except those who have been killed, have left one after another, empty-handed, taking refuge in other places. There is no housing, no food or clothing, sleeping in the open and eating in the wind, crying from hunger and cold. Excluding Nanjing, Shanghai, Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Lin'an, Bengbu, and other ports, just in Mingguang, a district of Jiashan County, there are no fewer than 1,000 households and more than 5,000 Xuyi refugees. Although half of these people are landlords and gentry, their livelihoods have almost been completely cut off after being exploited and trampled upon by the Communist army for eight years. If they are not quickly given relief, they will all be buried in ditches." The words are filled with sorrow. Is it blood? Is it tears? One cannot bear to finish reading.

Driven by Hunger, a Tragedy Unfolds

Bengbu is located in the middle reaches of the Huai River, at the intersection of the Jinpu Railway, connecting the north and south, and is an important town in northern Anhui. After this great war, although the outer shell remains, the spirit is gone. Bengbu was occupied for more than seven years, and the people were almost completely exploited, resulting in severe damage to their vitality. Before the war, Bengbu was a gathering place for salt and grain and a distribution center for goods in northern Anhui. Although the market is now crowded and bustling, and the surface of commerce appears to be gradually prospering, it is actually strong on the outside but weak on the inside. As a result of arbitrary quotas, the people are filled with complaints, and various arbitrary taxes continue to emerge endlessly. Recently, prices have soared, and people's purchasing power has weakened, causing all industries to show a bleak scene.

Recently, a tragic event occurred here, a heart-wrenching tragedy caused by hunger. It is reported that in Jingyi Road, Weiyi Lane, a refugee from Henan Province named Wang, a family of three, came to Bengbu last winter to make a living. Recently, due to rising prices and difficult living conditions, they were unable to borrow money. On the 28th of last month, the man strangled his own young son with a rope, and then the couple hanged themselves together. Afterwards, someone discovered the incident, and charitable organizations provided coffins for a hasty burial. The hardship of disaster victims seeking a living in the city can be seen from this.

### The Winds and Rains of Nanchang

The people of Nanchang often call the tall and solemn provincial government building here the "Nanchang White House." The willow trees inside and outside the White House are changing day by day, thriving and flourishing. The owner of the White House is also undergoing a transition from old to new, giving people a sentimental farewell to the old and deeply entrusting hopes to the new.

Cao Haosen has been in charge of Jiangxi for more than four years, and many people call him "Grandma Cao." Cao's departure during this period of urgent need for recuperation will surely leave people with fond memories.

Peach Blossoms Vie for Beauty in San Village, Bridge Water Carries Sorrow in Gaoqiao

San Village is only about five li away from the city. The peach blossoms in the village have always been famous for their beauty and are currently in full bloom. The authorities have already dispatched workers to repair the roads to facilitate tourists. Although the weather has not been good recently, many refined scholars are flocking to enjoy the scenery. They bring some snacks with them when they go and return with a few branches of peach blossoms. It is a great opportunity to linger and enjoy the scenery. However, this kind of scenery is only available to a few refined scholars.

Near Gaoqiao, there are many thatched huts. The area is low-lying and has many ditches. Recently, the rain gods have been rampant, and the surroundings of the thatched huts are filled with water, forming canals. As a result, the "refugees" inside have to drag through the mud when they go out, and they are suffocated by moldy air when they enter. Someone said with a bitter smile: "Ask the refugees of Gaoqiao how much sorrow they have? It's just like the turbid water flowing under the bridge."

Epidemics Rampant, Wind Disaster Also Terrifying

Meningitis and typhoid fever are the two major epidemics in this city. In particular, the spread of meningitis has now entered a rampant stage. The main reason for this is that garbage is everywhere, and the number of public toilets is small and extremely dirty. In addition, there is a shortage of housing and high rents, and the population is dense, resulting in poor air quality and the breeding of bacteria. Many people have died from meningitis, especially children. This cannot be said to be a serious problem.

But "misfortune never comes singly." A hurricane and thunderstorm on the sixth of this month caused significant damage. The newly built school building of the Provincial No. 2 Middle School completely collapsed, crushing one school worker to death and injuring eleven students.

But hurricanes are "natural disasters," and whether they will come again, people can only leave it to fate. Meningitis and other epidemics are not "natural disasters." Relevant parties really cannot let people resign themselves to fate.

Relief for the Unemployed: Jiangxi Office Faces Difficulties

The Jiangxi Branch of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) has been established for nearly five months. "The tower near the water gets the moonlight first." The poor people of this city have indeed enjoyed many benefits early on. For example, distributing 956 bags of flour and accommodating 240 elderly, young, disabled people are notable examples. But these are passive relief efforts. Active relief efforts are now underway: one is to provide small loans to small and medium-sized merchants, divided into two categories: Category A is 100,000 yuan, and Category B is 50,000 yuan. The other is to provide relief for the unemployed, accommodate unemployed poor people, provide them with professional training, and introduce them to employment. The former is less difficult, but the latter is very difficult because there are currently too many unemployed poor people in this city: a total of 14,579 people (including 7,336 men and 7,243 women). - This is undoubtedly a major difficulty for the Jiangxi Branch. How to quickly break through it will depend on the entire staff of the office brainstorming and working together to find solutions.

Education and Sports

### Ministry of Education Preliminary Revision: Elementary School Curriculum Standards, Grades One and Two Language and General Knowledge Combined Teaching, Arithmetic Not Listed as a Core Subject in Grade One, Eliminating Complex Teaching Materials, Concise and Essential Compilation

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing Special Dispatch] The Ministry of Education has held multiple meetings to discuss the revision of the elementary school curriculum. A preliminary draft has been agreed upon with several key points. After it is organized and completed, it will be brought back to the capital, and experts will be gathered again for a final decision. It is heard that the purpose of revising the elementary school curriculum is to eliminate complex and overly difficult teaching materials, creating a concise and essential compilation to suit the level and psychology of children, making it easier to understand, and achieving practical results. In addition, the Chinese language and general knowledge in grades one and two will be combined into a textbook for integrated teaching. General knowledge materials will be used in Chinese language classes to explain the words, and the content of general knowledge materials will also be explored in depth in general knowledge classes. For example, in the Chinese language class, the topic is "Frogs are Beneficial Insects," while in the general knowledge class, "Beneficial Insects" will be expanded and elaborated upon. General knowledge will only be established as a separate textbook from grade three onwards. Furthermore, considering that first graders are young, it is often difficult for them to understand if arithmetic is taught mechanically. Most people advocate that arithmetic should not be listed as a core subject in the first grade, and teaching should be done opportunistically during games. (An)

[Dahua News Agency, Nanjing Dispatch] According to Zhu Jingnong, the Vice Minister of Education, before leaving Chongqing, he convened a meeting of education experts to discuss the issue of university courses. It was generally believed that the common required courses and specialized required courses in Chinese universities placed too heavy a burden on students and should be improved by reducing the number of required courses and increasing the number of elective courses. After discussion, it was believed that common required courses such as history and philosophy should continue to be studied, while specialized required courses should be reduced as much as possible. At the same time, the number of credit hours in the four years of university, originally 136 (excluding physical education credit hours), has now been decided to be reduced to 128.

### Municipal Education Bureau Orders Private Schools to Report Actual Revenue

[This City Dispatch] The Municipal Education Bureau has always been deeply concerned about the difficult living conditions of teachers in private schools. Recently, as the living problem has become increasingly severe, faculty members have either presented their cases in person to seek assistance or have collectively requested relief. The bureau has done everything within its power to assist them. Fearing that the schools may have improper financial expenditures, the bureau has specifically issued a circular to all schools: (1) The exact amount of the second installment of tuition and miscellaneous fees collected by each school, or the amount of student funding, and the amount distributed to each teacher should be reported truthfully. (2) The current salary situation of teachers in each school, such as the highest monthly salary and the lowest monthly salary, should also be reported in detail truthfully. The above-mentioned items must be reported promptly within five days of receiving the document, and all schools are expected to comply.

### Twelve More Public Schools Opened

### Faculty Members of Colleges and Universities: Measures for Accepting Invitations to Study or Research Abroad

### Special Broadcast in San Francisco Celebrating Tsinghua Anniversary

[San Francisco Dispatch from the U.S. Information Service, 29th] A special broadcast program was held here today to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the founding of Tsinghua University. Mr. Orr, a former diplomatic official stationed in Peiping by the U.S. State Department, and Mr. Chen, Counselor of the Chinese Embassy, both gave speeches.

China's Revival Requires Talent

Mr. Orr, formerly a member of the Tsinghua Board of Trustees, referred to Tsinghua as a "model of international cooperation" in his speech. Mr. Orr's speech stated in brief: "The management of Tsinghua has, of course, always been in the hands of your country's authorities, but the United States government has never ceased to pay attention to Tsinghua during these 35 years. In 1908, the U.S. Congress remitted the indemnity to China, which happily helped establish Tsinghua. The Chinese and American authorities who agreed to establish Tsinghua did not know that their cooperative action was a precursor to international cooperation. During that period, when American schools discussed Tsinghua and the education of Chinese youth, they emphasized the need to train a large number of technical personnel. Currently, as in the past, the revival of China requires many, many people of this kind. It is generally believed that the return of the indemnity will enable China to obtain more experts more quickly. Most importantly, you graduates have increased China's strength, and, in the work of transforming the world based on international peace and justice, you have also fulfilled a very important responsibility in helping China become one of the leaders. Therefore, it is clear that Sino-American cooperation, using the indemnity for education, not only benefits China but also benefits the United States and the entire world. International reciprocal cooperation will produce valuable results, and Tsinghua proved the truth of this principle long ago. Even in the current world, the adoption of this principle has resulted in the United Nations, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the Food and Agriculture Organization, and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, etc. Your American friends firmly believe that on this memorable day, moving forward along new paths of international cooperation, you will surely be able to serve the Republic of China and the world with the same spirit."

The Earliest Effort in Sino-American Cooperation

Counselor Chen's speech stated in brief: "At one time, international relations were limited to affairs between governments. In the past few decades, this concept has been constantly changing. Now we pay more attention to the work of cultural exchange. We believe that the foundation of international relations should be built on mutual understanding between nations. We believe that this understanding is indeed a great force for maintaining international peace. The U.S. State Department and the U.S. Congress have formulated detailed plans for cultural cooperation with the aim of world peace. When this plan was discussed in the United States, the contribution of Tsinghua was often noted; Tsinghua was the earliest effort in this regard. Currently, there is a mutual understanding between the peoples of China and the United States, promoting active cooperation between the two countries in wartime and peacetime. This mutual understanding is also one of Tsinghua's contributions. Therefore, this year's Tsinghua anniversary is of utmost importance. In a private capacity, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the students and also hope that Tsinghua, after this unfortunate interlude, can redouble its efforts to create Sino-American contact and make a greater contribution to promoting international understanding, because in any case, international understanding is the foundation of world peace."

### Mayor's Cup Basketball Quarterfinals: Lianghua vs. Giants Tonight; Another Group: Xinhao vs. Enkas; Women's Quarterfinals: Green Team vs. Qinglian

The Mayor's Cup basketball tournament for men and women has entered the quarterfinal stage today, with a total of three games taking place at the Municipal Gymnasium from 6 PM. Tickets are priced at 1,000 yuan.

Women's Quarterfinals

The women's group will take the stage first, with the Green Team facing Qinglian. The latter demonstrated their bravery and combat skills during the preliminary round, defeating Xue Xue. However, they are likely to face an uphill battle against the Green Team, which is the league champion of the first division. Their players are all top-notch, with not only superb skills but also seamless cooperation. It is expected that they will eliminate Qinglian and win the right to the finals.

Men's Quarterfinals

Following the women's group, the men's group will compete, with the U.S. Air Force 3198 Signal Team facing the West Qing Enkas. The Signal Team demonstrated their full combat capabilities against Dahua the other day. Although their defense is relatively poor, their strength is quite abundant. Enkas has sophisticated technology and unwavering fighting spirit, and there is sure to be a great battle with the Signal Team.

In the last game, Lianghua will face the Giants. Lianghua is making a comeback this time, and old members such as Tang Baokun, Liu Zhenyuan, and Shen Yugong have returned. With the assistance of Wu Bixian, Zhuo Guorong, Liu Fushan, and Guo Jie, their lineup is strong and unmatched. Although they only made a small test against Zhenyuan in the preliminary match, they fully revealed their northern style. Zhenyuan and Baokun are as fierce as ever. Unfortunately, Li Zhen was injured and could not play, which is a slight flaw. The Giants have veterans Carson and Kailomitov, Taobolinji, and Funik, among other famous players, and their military appearance is prosperous and should not be underestimated. It is expected that a meeting between these Chinese and Western heroes will surely have a wonderful and enthusiastic performance. Today's schedule is as follows:

### Golden Lion Basketball Team Returns to Shanghai; One Last Loss to Liangxi

The Golden Lion Basketball Team from this city traveled to Liangxi last Friday (April 26th) and played three games in Xixi, winning two and losing one. They returned to Shanghai by express train last night. The expeditionary team defeated the White Team the other day in Xixi. The team visited the scenic Huishan on the morning of the day before, and in the afternoon competed with Gengyu Team, a strong local team from Xixi. Zhang Wenyuan served as the referee. The Golden Lions were even more rampant with the assistance of Shi Jiuquan. At the end of the first half, the result was 31 to 13, with the expeditionary team leading. Afterwards, the two teams played again. The Golden Lions' fresh troops continued to take the stage. Li Youxiang and Wu Zonglin of the Gengyu team were extremely active, but Huang Cunrui, Wang Rongsheng, and Wang Bingfu of the Golden Lions scored repeatedly, so Gengyu was ultimately difficult to surpass. As a result, the expeditionary team defeated Gengyu 65 to 41, winning their second victory. Yesterday, the visiting team toured the scenic spot Yuantouzhu. At 5 PM in the afternoon, they fought the Liangxi team at the original location. Fans flocked to watch, and the situation was unprecedentedly enthusiastic. The Golden Lions were inevitably tired from fighting for many days, and Liangxi was able to participate in Zhuo Guorong, making the lineup even more substantial. The referee was Xuan Hegao. The Golden Lion generals gave their lives for a while, and the first half ended with a narrow victory of 12 to 10. After a break, the battle resumed. Liangxi was ultimately a local strongman, and they quickly took the lead with 19 to 13. Not long after, Gao Baosheng of Liangxi and Huang Cunrui of the Golden Lions were both disqualified for committing four fouls. The Golden Lions had no leader and could not reverse the decline, and finally lost for the first time with a score of 15 to 24.

### The Cadre Melting Pot of the New Taiwan: A Sketch of the National Maritime Frontier School

— Lin Ying

Since the Cairo Conference decided that after the war, the Northeast, Taiwan, and other places would be re-assigned to China, the Central Government, in order to prepare for the future takeover of Taiwan and to actively cultivate maritime frontier specialists, hastily established this "National Maritime Frontier School."

The emergence of the Maritime School was, in the eyes of most people at the time, a "mystery." This was because the war within the country was entering its most serious stage, and the southeastern provinces were almost completely isolated. The idea of victory could be said to have faded from the minds of the people. Who would have thought that we would regain the beautiful Taiwan in the near future! Fortunately, this gentle measure by the Central Government somewhat restored the confidence of the people in the Southeast at that time, making people feel that the government was thinking about victory in every way. The Maritime School became a symbol of victory for the people of the Southeast at that time!

The first person to be ordered to come to Fujian to prepare for this school was Mr. Zhang Zhaohuan from Xianyou. He arrived in Fujian in June of the 33rd year [of the Republic] [1944]. In just a few months, with the enthusiastic support of the people in the Putian and Xianyou area, he determined the temporary school site in his hometown of Xianyou. The dormitories and classrooms were set up in the original headquarters of the division management area, and enrollment began immediately. At that time, the quota was 200 students. High school graduates or those with equivalent qualifications could apply. The only restriction was that people from southern Fujian had to account for 70 percent of the students, because the language of southern Fujian is the same system as that of Taiwan, and they can communicate freely. According to the original plan, the scale of the Maritime School was quite large. The entire school had four departments, organized as follows:

1. Administrative Department: Set up civil affairs, finance, education, construction, and other groups, with the aim of cultivating county government personnel.

2. Normal Department: Set up literature, history, civics, mathematics, and other groups, with the aim of training primary and secondary school teachers.

3. Technical Department: Set up aquaculture, sugar manufacturing, tea making, iron smelting, and other groups, with the aim of training specialized technicians.

4. Special Department: Specifically handles various training classes set up due to special needs.

In the first semester, only 50 students each were enrolled in the finance and education groups of the Administrative Department, and 100 students were enrolled in the Literature and History group of the Normal Department. After the victory of the War of Resistance, due to the need to change goals, the school also made appropriate reductions and adjustments. Therefore, the Administrative Department was changed to the Department of Law and Commerce, and the service locations were expanded from Taiwan to the coastal areas and Southeast Asia. The Normal Department added a "five-year normal course" under the two-year system, enrolling graduates from junior high schools and above. Other departments will be planned according to the situation.

Mr. Zhang, the original principal, was once transferred to serve as the principal of the National Conservatory of Music. Mr. Liang Longguang, a member of the Fujian Provincial Senate, succeeded as the head of the Maritime School. Mr. Liang is from southern Fujian and has been engaged in party affairs education in various parts of Southeast Asia for decades. Therefore, after taking over, he immediately moved the school site from central Fujian to Jiudu, which belongs to Nanan County in southern Fujian. This place is close to Yongchun, Xianyou, and other places, and transportation can still be considered convenient. Because it is temporary in nature, the equipment is still simple.

Currently, there are more than 390 students in the entire school (including 100 five-year normal school students). They all live together on weekdays. There is no such freedom as in ordinary universities here. "Withdrawal" and "demerit" of students can be found from time to time. Students' "treatment" is entirely provided by the school. In addition to the national university public expense standard of 34 and a half catties of rice and 1,750 yuan for non-staple food per month, there are also some pocket money. There is a set of uniforms every school year, and students in the normal school are even more privileged, and they don't have to bother their parents to pay out of their pockets. Even students with larger expenses will not "run out of money at the bedside." Therefore, the lives of Maritime School students can be said to be stable.

There are not many extracurricular activities for students. Compared with ordinary schools, there is a special feature here, that is, the first language that must be used is Southern Fujianese - that is, Taiwanese, followed by Mandarin (but in Fujian, every student can speak it), and the third is English. In terms of courses, in addition to the compulsory courses in ordinary middle and high schools, several courses in administrative management, teaching outline, etc. have been added.

According to regulations, students' future is to be sent to work in Taiwan by the government, but perhaps the possibility of Southeast Asia is greater in the future, because Taiwan has returned to the motherland: after that, there will be various talents who will go there, but the 6 million overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia have always been in a state of helplessness. Maritime School students should at least shoulder the mission of education and guidance in this regard.

Restoration issue: Regarding the school site, it was once proposed to move it to Taiwan at the time of victory, but later, for actual needs, the discussion was terminated midway. According to the decision of the school affairs meeting, it will be moved to Heshan, Xiamen. That place is surrounded by mountains and close to the sea, and it is much more convenient in terms of scenery, transportation, and experimentation. As for the issue of the school system, Principal Liang once had two plans: (1) Ask the Ministry of Education to add a research department under the school (divided into three groups: history and geography, immigration, and law and commerce, with a study period of two years, to serve two-year academic students after the service period expires to continue their studies). (2) Change to a college (or a joint college of law and commerce normal school). So that students have more opportunities to engage in deeper learning. Mr. Liang has already taken advantage of this opportunity to attend the Senate meeting to go to Chongqing to negotiate with the Ministry, and it is expected that a decision will be made after he returns.

Our country's coastline is long, but the border defense for hundreds of years has been so lax. The establishment of the Maritime School is a meaning that alarms people. The future of the Maritime School should not be ignored!

### Long-Stable Gold Prices Suddenly Soar Yesterday; Peak Transaction at 1.93 Million; Allotment Price Opens at 1.68

Yellow dross soared to prominence yesterday, and in the stillness, there was a stirring; people's minds tended to cling to power. News of the rise in South African gold prices and the ban on silver firms and money changers trading foreign currency cash without the approval of the Central Bank of China (CBC) from next month, led shortsighted and sensitive observers to believe that the demand for foreign currency would become more difficult. At the same time, there were speculative concerns about the CBC's various policies starting May 1st. Once a frenzy was set off, buyers poured in one after another. Although the CBC tried its best to suppress it, it was too hasty, and the CBC allotted 866 bars of gold to the gold industry at 1.68 million. It was impossible to deliver that day and needed to be smelted into common bars, which would not be available until around 5 o'clock at the earliest. Once all these news were spread, various speculative funds felt that there was an opportunity to be seized, causing the CBC to secretly sell off through allied firms in addition to formally allotting gold to the industry. The rising wind was still difficult to contain and repeatedly rose and fell. The market once broke through 1.9 million twice, reaching a peak of 1.93 million. It was found that the morning opening stood above 1.6 million. After the opening, initially stimulated by the rise in U.S. dollars, buyers were already moving. When it broke through the 1.7 mark, most people no longer cared about the CBC's allotment price of 1.6 million. Around 1.78 million, the CBC sold some, and many parties also released gold, once falling to around 1.68 million. After several consultations, the CBC began to allot gold at this price, but the rush to exchange stocks for gold and the buying frenzy spread widely. In an instant, the rising trend started again. At noon, it struggled around 1.8 million. In the afternoon, because the CBC had no gold to deliver that day, buyers were unafraid. The CBC successively released no less than a thousand bars, but it still repeatedly crossed the 1.9 mark before turning the market. As a result, it soared by 280,000 compared to last Saturday. Gold jewelry rose by 198,000, silver remained flat, and silver dollars rose slightly. Due to the sudden increase in speculative sales, the unofficial exchange rate rose from 13% to about 20%. The CBC has yet to pay for most of the allotted gold. It is unknown whether the gold bulls will have momentum today.

### Public Bonds Decline

The public bond environment has shifted. It is reported that the Ministry of Finance's bond lottery redemption has been moved to Shanghai. Many parties saw the opportunity and took profits, losing support and falling sharply. From a morning opening of 7,600 yuan, the Unified Bonds gradually declined, once breaking through the 6,000 mark and reaching a low price of 5,800 yuan. At noon, it hovered around 6,100 yuan, resulting in a drop of 1,300 compared to last Saturday. Other bonds also followed suit and fell by 1,400.

### Cotton Merchants Raise Prices; Limited Spot Cotton Transactions

Yesterday, New York American cotton telegraphic prices rose by 9 to 12 points, with the near-term price at US$27.89, the far-term price at US$27.95, and the Middling spot price at US$28.52. The local spot cotton market was affected by the soaring gold and yarn prices, and cotton merchants quoted surprisingly high prices, making negotiations difficult to approach. As a result, transactions were underdeveloped. Shenxin No. 1 Factory still made purchases. Transactions between cotton firms were still lively. The delivered price of Middling spot cotton to the factory approached 100,000 yuan, a price 23,000 yuan higher than last Saturday.

### New Flag Tea Weakens and Falls

The flag tea produced in Meijiawu, Hangzhou, is of good "color," "fragrance," and "taste," and is superior to the products of other production areas. This year's new goods have been on the market for a long time, but due to the decline in the situation in this city, they have also gradually weakened. Recently, the inter-firm price has fallen to 3.5 million yuan per dan. As for Ping Shui, Wenzhou, and other Longjing teas, more and more sources have arrived in recent days, and sellers are eager to sell, resulting in a market that has plummeted. Suzhou gangs are secretly absorbing a fair amount of aged tea. Furthermore, scattered stores in Tianjin and other places and this street are involved, so the overall situation can still be supported.

### Various Yarns Soar; 10-Count Coarse Yarn Particularly Popular

Yesterday, the yarn market soared. Initially, news of the soaring gold and U.S. dollar prices spread, and yarn was not to be outdone, with all counts soaring. At the same time, actual sales were also extremely strong, and various gangs successively absorbed yarn, resulting in a general increase of more than 10%. 10-count coarse yarn was particularly popular. It is reported that demand exceeds supply in the Shanghai market, and people are unusually excited. Therefore, when the Fangjian Company opened yarn at noon, the place was crowded with people. Colleagues were scrambling to purchase, but because there was too little porridge and too many monks, the number allocated to each factory was extremely limited. The price opened was 50,000 to 270,000 higher than the previous period, with the 42-count thread having the largest increase. In addition, there were ten types of yarn offered for tender, and it is reported that Chenxingchang, Zhendachang, Zhengde, Tong茂chang and other firms and Yongda Dyeing and Weaving Factory successfully bid for seven types. There were also four counts and five counts of coarse yarn for which no one bid.

### Affected by Gold Prices, Silk Prices Rise Across the Board

Yesterday, the silk market was stimulated by gold prices, and prices rose across the board, permeating the market. 120-count Tianqiao rayon opened at 1.72 million yuan and closed at 1.8 million yuan, with the smallest transaction price of 1.7 million yuan in the middle. The afternoon was even better, reaching a high of 1.85 million yuan. Other goods all rose by 100,000 to 200,000 yuan. Factory-managed foreign firm goods did not open for trading. The Robin Hood transaction price was 2.1 million yuan, and other grades were all 100,000 to 200,000 yuan higher. The price of silk fabrics was quite stable at the opening. Dacheng checkered crepe opened at 4,050 yuan and rose to 250 yuan with transactions. Later, it was heard that raw material prices had soared, so it was also raised to 400 yuan. In the afternoon, people were even more optimistic, shouting up to 4,550 yuan. The Meiya bedding business had transactions at 1.23 million yuan in the morning, and closed at 1.3 million yuan in the morning, and then rose by 60,000 yuan in the afternoon.

### Caustic Soda Shortages and Prices Rise

Yesterday, the caustic soda market was very chaotic. The reasons are nothing more than the following: Gold and U.S. dollars rose sharply, American orders arriving in Shanghai were very few, and exports from Manila and other places were not allowed. The actual sales of factories in this city increased daily, and inventories were drying up. The market was bullish, so various firms rushed to purchase, and the price soared from 300,000 to 350,000, but no one was willing to sell. Only yellow petroleum jelly and bleaching powder had arrived, and the prices fell slightly.

### New-Style Tires Appear; U.S. Exports Increase

[Reuters, Detroit, 29th] Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company announced: This company has recently manufactured a new type of tire with a specially designed tread for trucks. It is expected to be mass-produced in mid-June.

[Reuters, Washington, 29th] The Civilian Production Administration announced: The number of tire exports in the second quarter of this year will reach 937,500 units, while the number of tire exports in the first quarter of this year was 727,500 units.

### Sweet Rain in Hunan; Rice Prices Plummet

[Central News Agency, Changsha, 28th] Hunan Province looks promising. Sweet rain fell heavily on the 27th, and torrential rain continued all day today, and rice prices plummeted, to the delight of the people.

### Market Speculative Funds Shift Targets; Chinese Stocks Go From Strong to Weak; Foreign Stocks Also Decline Steadily

Chinese stocks initially continued the momentum from Saturday afternoon, appearing tight. However, the appeal of gold and foreign currency aroused interest among stock market participants. Once attention shifted, speculative funds began to flow out of the stock market. Wing On Spinning, from 6300 yuan, Mei Ah, from 5300 yuan, King Fook, from 520 yuan, Sun Kwong, from 460 yuan, and Chun Hing, from 390 yuan, gradually declined. At the same time, unpopular stocks rose, with Sino-French Underwear reaching over 250 yuan, matches at 1600 yuan, and old shares also seeing calls for a 10% increase. Thus, popular stocks experienced a double whammy, with Wing On Spinning falling to 5600 yuan, Mei Ah to 4700 yuan, and King Fook to around 470 yuan. The midday close was slightly flat. Sun Kwong and Chun Hing ended at lower prices. Unpopular stocks were ultimately unsustainable, with high prices being fleeting. Some even fell back to Saturday's prices. As a result, Wing On Spinning, Mei Ah, and King Fook were flat compared to last Saturday, while Sun Kwong and Chun Hing fell by over ten yuan each. In addition, Sino Land and Wing Fung were flat. China Textile and Great China, due to their long-standing reputation, were sought after, each rising by 15%. Sino-French and New Asia Underwear saw some squeeze-ups, and old shares were also called for a 10% increase. Scattered overnight transactions in the afternoon also saw improved bids. Foreign stocks were affected by securities firms abandoning stocks and turning to gold and foreign currency activities, leading to a decline. Ewo Spinning fell steadily from a high of 17600 yuan. However, the fate of unpopular and small stocks varied. In the past few days, their gains were limited, presenting a mixed picture of both prosperity and decline. Compared to last Saturday, the midday close showed Ewo Spinning and British American Tobacco each down 1000 yuan, Paper Industry and Kwong Wei down, Ewo Brewery flat, and China Enamelware slightly up. Bids for popular stocks continued to decline in the afternoon.

### 中砂白七萬元　昨日停止標售
### Zhongsha White Sugar at 70,000 Yuan; Auction Suspended Yesterday

Yesterday, the sugar market was scheduled for auction. The Zhongsha White Sugar Association temporarily reduced the bid to 64,500 yuan, but then suspended the auction because the goods were not yet available for delivery. As a result, the price tightened again, rising to 68,500 yuan. In the afternoon, it was even tighter, with bids ranging from 69,000 yuan to 70,000 yuan, slightly flat compared to the previous day. However, the market remained firm. Three-and-a-half White Sugar was bid at 75,000 yuan.

### 證券從業員要求　恢復自由買賣
### Securities Professionals Demand Resumption of Free Trading

To appeal for the temporary resumption of free trading of securities, securities professionals hosted a reception yesterday at the Capital Garden for representatives from all sectors of the city and newspaper reporters. Those present included Gu Bingyuan from the Social Affairs Bureau, Wang Qiji from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Feng You from the Central Propaganda Department, Yu Cheng, Chairman of the Securities Professionals Association, Xu Yongzuo, an accountant, and several dozen newspaper reporters. Yu Mingyue, a representative of the industry, gave a speech, stating: "Before the opening of the securities exchange, buying and selling activities occurred due to the actual needs of both parties. Securities professionals served the public as intermediaries, which did not conflict with law, reason, or human sentiment. However, recently, the administrative authorities have repeatedly ordered them to cease operations, causing the livelihood of the professionals to be cut off, and the public with securities also feels inconvenienced. Therefore, we specifically request all sectors to uphold justice." Subsequently, Xu Yongzuo, Feng You, Yu Cheng, and others stood up and spoke, generally expressing agreement with the principles of the industry's request. Gu Bingyuan, the representative of the Social Affairs Bureau, hoped that the industry would pay attention to whether the listed stocks themselves were legal, and that securities companies or firms that had not registered with the Social Affairs Bureau should quickly complete the procedures to obtain legal status.

### 買戶爭先恐後　美鈔漲風大熾　較上週六升三百元
### Buyers Scramble; US Dollar Surge Intensifies; Up 300 Yuan Compared to Last Saturday

The US dollar opened at 2340 yuan, and immediately buyers rushed in, scrambling to get their hands on it. Foreign exchange dealers were unable to cope, and at one point the bid-ask spread widened to a difference of 100 yuan. After 10:00 AM, it fell back from over 2650 yuan to below 2500 yuan, but demand continued to come in, fearing that it would be impossible to buy starting next month, and it rose again to 2680 yuan, hovering around 2670 yuan at midday. In the afternoon, the gold market was brisk, and the US dollar was also boosted to over 2700 yuan. There was also a large outflow of physical currency. High prices were difficult to sustain, but sentiment remained firm and momentum did not subside. It finally ended at around 2650 yuan, up 310 yuan compared to last Saturday. Hong Kong dollar notes, being unpopular, did not have the speculative frenzy of gold and foreign currency. Even at its craziest, it could not exceed 490 yuan, and was constrained by the Hong Kong exchange rate. Although it rose, it was not much. It also rose by over thirty yuan. Hong Kong telegraphic transfers were at 4670, with outflows. Robbie was at 575 yuan. US exchange rates were flat, but supply was limited.

### 煤市微有波動
### Slight Fluctuations in the Coal Market

Yesterday, the coal market initially felt excited upon hearing of rising gold prices. However, due to limited actual sales, it became weak again. Prices mostly fell, with white coal lumps and bituminous coal lumps being relatively sluggish. Market prices continued to decline slightly. Although sales of bituminous coal seams to factories in the city did not increase, purchases by out-of-town customers were active, and the market trended slightly firm. White coal nuggets and coal seams were supported at low levels.

### 美棉麥均短少

### National Resources Commission Plans to Establish Refinery and Machinery Factory

The three former enemy and puppet-controlled oil depots in Gaoqiao, Pudong, including Lianli, which were previously taken over by the National Resources Commission, have recently begun to be reorganized, and the establishment of the Shanghai Refinery is being planned. It is said that the original oil depot sites will soon begin refining gasoline and diesel. It is reported that the three oil depots occupy a large area and are well-equipped. After refining begins, there will be a large supply of gasoline to the city.

In addition, in order to develop the machinery industry, the National Resources Commission is currently planning to establish a large-scale machinery company to purchase machine tools (master machines) and equipment for manufacturing general-purpose machines from abroad. It is learned that the Commission is planning to first establish a general-purpose machine limited company to manufacture water pumps, air compressors, internal combustion engines, and hoisting equipment to meet current urgent needs.

### 湖南紡織業　戰後產銷概況
### Post-War Production and Sales of the Hunan Textile Industry

According to Mr. Chen of the Hunan First Textile Factory, before the war, the Hunan provincial government established the First and Second Factories in Anjiang, with over 50,000 spindles, capable of producing 3,000 bales of cotton yarn per day. After the fall, they were moved to the rear and have now resumed operation. Due to difficulties in materials and transportation, the Second Factory has been temporarily merged into the First Factory. Approximately 20,000 spindles are currently in use, producing over 1,000 bales of yarn per day. There are also 200 looms in operation, producing as usual. In terms of raw materials, they are purchased from cotton-producing areas in the Jiangxi-Hubei border area. However, due to the obsolescence of the machinery, the quality of the cotton cloth produced is relatively coarse. Therefore, the products are mainly sold to farmers in the southwestern provinces. The factory provides military uniforms and civil service uniforms for Hunan Province at low prices. However, foreign cloth has now been transported to Hunan. Therefore, the factory's products will be sold to the northwestern provinces. The Third Yarn Factory, jointly operated by various groups, has fewer spindles and its production is not large.

### 行號雙方起爭執　米市場演全武行　麵粉油豆均回跌
### Quarrel Breaks Out Between Firms; All-Out Brawl in Rice Market; Flour, Oil, and Beans All Decline

Since the 100 million rice loan was undertaken by 17 rice firms, including Liang San Tai and Wanchang, it has been repeatedly reported that rice has been procured. However, rice prices continue to rise daily, with japonica and indica rice approaching the 50,000 mark. At the same time, the 2,000 members of the local Rice Industry Association also stated that, although the rice firms have taken out loans to procure rice, they have not yet distributed it to the individual shops for retail sales. Yesterday, when the rice market opened, all the rice shops unanimously requested the rice firms to distribute rice, leading to a dispute between the two sides. Order broke down and chairs were overturned, making it impossible for the market to operate. Both sides sent representatives to the authorities to request a public judgment. (For details, please see today's local news in this newspaper.)

Yesterday, flour prices plummeted by 3-4,000 yuan due to the authorities' ban on exports and the cessation of sales in other provinces, leading hoarders to dump their stocks. The oil market saw a surge in arrivals, and shop owners, expecting a further decline, slashed prices by 8-9,000 yuan, nearly 10,000 yuan. Peanut skin prices fell by 5-600 yuan, with few buyers. Bean cake prices fell by 2-300 yuan, and raw peanut prices fell by 2-3,000 yuan, with few transactions. However, yellow soybeans rose by 2-3,000 yuan due to inquiries from Zhejiang and Fujian. Corn and red sorghum both rose by 1-2,000 yuan. Red beans were scarce, with some being procured from Southeast Asia, rising by 2-3,000 yuan.

### 憨人領導世界前進
### Fools Lead the World Forward

— 楊謀
— Yang Mou

沒有憨人，畫部的歷史也許會黯然失色。歲月的推移，原是極平淡的活動的記錄，憨人憨事點綴其間，才使宇宙的生命虎虎有生氣。
Without fools, the history of the painting department might be dull and colorless. The passage of time is originally a record of extremely mundane activities, and it is the embellishment of fools and their foolish deeds that gives the life of the universe a vibrant energy.

多少政治舞毫上活躍的英雄，多少研究室中孜孜不倦的科學家，原祇都憑着一點憨勁，與舊環境舊思想舊系統搏鬥，從絕望的幽谷中開關康莊大道。
How many heroes active on the political stage, how many tireless scientists in the laboratory, all rely on a bit of foolish energy to fight against the old environment, old ideas, and old systems, and open up a broad road from the valley of despair.

成也罷，敗也罷，出發點總是相同的，爲的是堅固的信仰，不拔的憨勁而已，丟云現實的苟安的生活，背起了荊棘的十安架，去找尋理想的實現，世界上面，除了染着憨氣的，恐怕誰也不會幹吧！
Success or failure, the starting point is always the same, for the sake of a firm belief, an unwavering foolish energy. They abandon the life of complacent ease in reality, shoulder the thorny cross, and seek the realization of ideals. In this world, who would do it except for those who are tainted with foolishness?

固然，理想的夢還距離得渺遠，，自已却已受陵得千瘡百孔，頽然倒下的，書不勝書。但是，在歷史上留下名字
Admittedly, the dream of ideals is still far away, and they themselves are riddled with holes, collapsing and falling. There are countless books about it. However, their names remain in history.

基督的精神，伽利略的精神，都替人類的進程，註下了最光輝的一頁。一切無恥的卑賤的阻撓一都只是徒然的白費心力而已。
The spirit of Christ, the spirit of Galileo, have all marked the most glorious page in the progress of mankind. All shameless, base obstruction is just a futile waste of effort.

世界是必然前進的，憨人領導着世界的前進。誰也阻不了這洪流，阻遏也是枉然。
The world is bound to advance, and fools lead the world forward. No one can stop this torrent, and obstruction is in vain.

### 四月五月好辰光
### April and May: Good Times

— 姜建邦
— Jiang Jianbang

我們只知道每年四月和五月是最適宜於遊玩的季節，不知道四”和五月也正是最利於工作的時候。心理學者吿訴我們，一年中工作最有效率的月份是五月，四月，九月，七月，八月，和三月。效率最小的月份是二月，十二月，十月，一月，十一月和六月。
We only know that April and May are the best seasons for playing, but we don't know that April and May are also the best times for working. Psychologists tell us that the most efficient months of the year for working are May, April, September, July, August, and March. The least efficient months are February, December, October, January, November, and June.

四月和五月是人類的最大恩人。在這時候，我們的工作最有效率，我們也最喜歡活動。在不寒不暖，風和日煦的情形下，給我們安排了一個最適宜於工作的壞境。
April and May are the greatest benefactors of mankind. At this time, our work is most efficient and we also enjoy activities the most. In the not-too-cold, not-too-warm, breezy, and sunny conditions, they arrange an environment that is best suited for work.

天氣不斷的稍有變化，（連續持久者例外），可以引起活動的興趣和工作的慾望。四月和五月正合這個條件。淸晨和黃昏雖然有些冷意，但到中午，就感到有些熟了。在這種變化中，使我們有了活動的刺激。
Constant and slight changes in the weather (except for continuous and persistent ones) can arouse interest in activities and a desire to work. April and May fit this condition. Although it is a bit cold in the early morning and dusk, it feels a bit warmer by noon. In this kind of change, we have a stimulus for activity.

世界上許多偉大的著作和發明，都是出於四月和五月。大詩人但丁寫新生是在四月，寫神曲是在三月。米爾頓的失樂園是在某年的四月開始的。歌德寫少年維特之煩惱是在秋天，寫浮士德是在三月，寫色覺論是在五月。達爾文進化論的觀念是萌芽於某年的三月，哥俞布環遊地球的思想是發生在五月，加利略發現土星圈是在四月，發現太陽斑點是在五月，風雨表的發明也在五月。可見在四五月裏，我們的思想最活躍。統計者吿訴我們，世界上偉大的發明以五月爲最多，四月次之。
Many of the world's great works and inventions came out of April and May. The great poet Dante wrote *La Vita Nuova* in April and *Divine Comedy* in March. Milton's *Paradise Lost* began in April of a certain year. Goethe wrote *The Sorrows of Young Werther* in autumn, *Faust* in March, and *Theory of Colours* in May. Darwin's concept of evolution germinated in March of a certain year, Columbus' idea of circumnavigating the earth occurred in May, Galileo discovered the rings of Saturn in April, discovered sunspots in May, and the invention of the barometer was also in May. It can be seen that our minds are most active in April and May. Statisticians tell us that the world's great inventions are most numerous in May, followed by April.

我國以五月爲多事之秋。除了國際性的五一節以外，有五三，五四，五五，五七，五九，五卅等紀念日。可見五月裏人們活動性的厲害了。
In our country, May is a season of many events. In addition to the international May Day, there are commemorative days such as May 3rd, May 4th, May 5th, May 7th, May 9th, and May 30th. It can be seen how powerful the activity of people in May is.

在四月和五月裏，我們的工作最是正確。銀行裏記賬員的錯誤最多是發生在十月，十一月，和十二月裘；錯誤最少的是五月四月和九月。在這些時候，我們的心境愉快，腦子淸爽，最利於工作。
In April and May, our work is the most accurate. The most mistakes made by bank tellers occur in October, November, and December; the fewest mistakes are made in May, April, and September. At these times, our minds are happy, and our brains are clear, making it most conducive to work.

春天來了，我們的身體好像輕快了許多，好像有了勤勞的習慣，不願做的事，這時願做了。懶洋洋的心情會給春神趕走的。
Spring has come, and our bodies seem much lighter, as if we have developed a habit of diligence. Things we were unwilling to do, we are now willing to do. The lazy mood will be driven away by the goddess of spring.

春天是慈母，在她的懷抱裏可以像孩子一樣的跳躍遊玩，享受甜蜜的溫情，但是我們也要用比較嚴肅的態度來過它－－在這個工作最有效率的時候，多做些工作。
Spring is a kind mother, and in her embrace, we can jump and play like children, enjoying sweet tenderness. But we must also spend it with a more serious attitude—do more work at this time when work is most efficient.

今年的四月已去其半；但五月不久即到。桃花憶落，楊柳垂青·換上輕鬆的春服，打起點精神，轉向你的工作吧，莫再蹉跎，失掉這一段最好的時光！
Half of April this year has already passed, but May will arrive soon. Peach blossoms remember falling, and willows droop green. Change into light spring clothes, cheer up a bit, and turn to your work, don't procrastinate any longer, and lose this best time!

### 瀋陽的文化界
### The Cultural Scene in Shenyang

— Chen Yanfan

瀋陽的報紙現在共有四種，一是遼瀋日報，一是中蘇日報，另外是靑年日報和「和平日報」。靑年日報是靑年軍二〇七師辦的，但是我還沒有看見過。和平日報比較最有歷史，他的前身是掃蕩報，內容比較最充實一點。最近還有一種大報將要出版，那便是前進報。前進一報是接收了盛京日報改出的，所以設備都相當完善。這　　　原來　在錦州出版，後來因爲環境的需要，乃改來瀋陽籌備。我在十天以前到瀋陽的，本來還要到長春去，可是爲了參加前進報，也許一時便不能離開。
There are currently four newspapers in Shenyang. One is *Liaoshen Daily*, one is *China-Soviet Daily*, and the others are *Youth Daily* and *"Peace Daily"*. *Youth Daily* is run by the 207th Division of the Youth Army, but I haven't seen it yet. *Peace Daily* has the most history, its predecessor being *Sweeping Bandits Daily*, and its content is more substantial. Recently, another large newspaper is about to be published, namely *Forward Daily*. *Forward Daily* was transformed from *Shengjing Daily*, so the equipment is quite complete. This [newspaper] was originally published in Jinzhou, but later, due to environmental needs, it was changed to Shenyang for preparation. I arrived in Shenyang ten days ago, and I was originally going to Changchun, but in order to participate in *Forward Daily*, I may not be able to leave for a while.

瀋陽的報紙雖然有這一些。可是在街上，幾乎看不到一個報販。像上海那樣到處擺着花花緣綠的雜誌報童的報攤，在瀋陽是沒有的。瀋陽的街上多的是馬車，「得，得……」「有，有……呼喝　馬之聲不絕。沒有到這裏之前，我沒有想到潘陽是這樣個個地方。潘陽的建築市容和地域的寬展，都不比上海弱。北地就是多風，而且地燥，走在街上，時時風沙蔽天，這時候口眾是必不可少的。
Although there are some newspapers in Shenyang, you can hardly see a newspaper vendor on the street. There are no newsstands with boys displaying colorful magazines like in Shanghai. There are many carriages on the streets of Shenyang, and the sounds of "De, de..." "Yo, yo..." and shouting at the horses never cease. Before coming here, I didn't expect Shenyang to be such a place. Shenyang's architecture, cityscape, and territorial expanse are no weaker than Shanghai's. The northern region is windy and dry, and when walking on the street, the wind and sand often obscure the sky. At this time, masks are essential.

爲了目前瀋陽在各方而的重要性，上海和平津各地的記者都差不多已集中到這裏了。申報的韓淸濤先生，一月前我去北鎭縣時他在那邊，後來我在溝帮子時聽說他也在那邊，他到瀋陽恐怕也在我之前。康正平最近亦在此地出現。這裏雜誌之類的刊物幾乎看不見。有也不過二三種。我這十天以來正想籌備出一份綜合半月刋。定名爲「松花江」。自已的期望是很大的，不知道出來之後是什麽樣子。
Due to the current importance of Shenyang in all aspects, reporters from Shanghai, Peiping, and Tianjin have almost all gathered here. Mr. Han Qingtao of *Shen Bao* was in Beizhen County when I went there a month ago. Later, when I was in Goubangzi, I heard that he was also there. He probably arrived in Shenyang before me. Kang Zhengping has also recently appeared here. Magazines and other publications are almost invisible here. There are only two or three types. In the past ten days, I have been thinking of preparing a comprehensive semi-monthly publication, named "Songhua River". My expectations are very high, but I don't know what it will be like after it comes out.

### 麥帥小史
### A Short Biography of MacArthur

— 鍾佐
— Zhong Zuo

現任聯合國駐日最高統帥麥克沃塞元帥，在一八八〇年誕生於美國阿肯色州的力特爾洛克城。他父親亞麥克沃塞將軍，南北戰爭時，曾因屢次戰勝，而得國會的榮譽獎章，不久又在菲列濱戰役中得名，於是任菲島第一任軍事總督。
General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, the current Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers in Japan, was born in 1880 in Little Rock, Arkansas, USA. His father, General Arthur MacArthur Jr., received the Congressional Medal of Honor for repeated victories during the American Civil War. He soon gained fame in the Philippine-American War and became the first military governor of the Philippines.

麥帥非常服從他的母親，他母親對他的前途有極大的影響。每逢麥帥的生日，她必有一次長而重要的談話，勉勵他的將來，她給麥帥種下一種印象：他是一側具有榮譽星章名將的兒子。她繼續管理麥帥，直到八十二歲時才逝世。
MacArthur was very obedient to his mother, and she had a great influence on his future. On MacArthur's birthday, she would always have a long and important conversation to encourage his future, instilling in MacArthur the impression that he was the son of a famous general with a medal of honor. She continued to manage MacArthur until she passed away at the age of eighty-two.

一八九九年麥帥入西點軍校，一九〇三年以全級第一名畢業，他得到百年來軍校中從未有的最高分數紀綠，四年中他的平均分數是九八，一四。
In 1899, MacArthur entered West Point Military Academy, and in 1903, he graduated at the top of his class. He obtained the highest score record in the military academy in a century, with an average score of 98.14 over four years.

他一半因爲他父親的關係，所以常覺得他的命運與菲列濱有密切的聯繫。他在菲島的第一個工作是測量雷伊泰島有軍事價値的海濱地帶，四十二年後麥帥竟會領導美軍登陸該島。
Partly because of his father's relationship, he often felt that his fate was closely linked to the Philippines. His first job in the Philippines was to survey the coastal areas of Leyte Island with military value. Forty-two years later, MacArthur would lead the US military to land on the island.

日俄戰爭時，麥帥的父親任美軍事觀察隊長，麥帥就在他父親手下任隨員，駐在東京。他在這一個時期，以及在菲島的幾年中，曾悉心硏究日本國民心理。
During the Russo-Japanese War, MacArthur's father served as the head of the US military observation team, and MacArthur served as his aide, stationed in Tokyo. During this period, as well as in the Philippines for several years, he carefully studied the Japanese national psyche.

第一次世界大戰時，麥帥任美軍中最年靑的師團長，不久轉任西點軍校監督。
During World War I, MacArthur served as the youngest division commander in the US Army, and soon transferred to be the superintendent of West Point Military Academy.

一九二三年，麥帥又回到菲列濱，任旅團長，負責踏勘巴坦島的防禦工程。
In 1923, MacArthur returned to the Philippines again, serving as a brigade commander, responsible for surveying the defense projects of Bataan Island.

一九三〇年至一九三年間，麥帥任參謀總長，一九三五年後再回菲島，開訓練及編制菲島國民軍，並不斷增强該島防禦，以應付不能避免的日美戰爭。
From 1930 to 1935, MacArthur served as Chief of Staff. In 1935, he returned to the Philippines again to train and organize the Philippine National Army, and constantly strengthen the island's defenses to cope with the inevitable Japanese-American War.

### 台灣有屋無人住
### Houses in Taiwan are Empty

— 乃藩
— Naifan

在上海，窒息在鴿　般的小屋子裏的人們，來到合灣，會深深的舒了一口氣。
People in Shanghai, suffocating in pigeon-sized houses, will take a deep breath when they come to Taiwan.

台灣有五十萬以上的日橋，現在差不多已撤退完畢，他們在台灣，都是天之驕子，都有很好的房子住，有些是私人建造的，大部分却是公家供給的。各機關的公務員，各工廠的職員，各學校的敎員，都有公家供給的住宅，現在，這些房屋，都已空下來，移交給新的主人。
There are more than 500,000 Japanese in Taiwan, and they have now almost all withdrawn. In Taiwan, they are all the darlings of heaven and live in good houses. Some are privately built, but most are provided by the government. Civil servants of various agencies, employees of various factories, and teachers of various schools all have government-provided housing. Now, these houses are all empty and handed over to new owners.

到合灣來的公務員，第一件大事似乎就是找房子。房子是到處可有的，你只要認定了一座，向主管機關備了案，領一張日產接管委員會的封條貼上，或者就由自己的機關寫一張封條，亦無不可。這房子便算是你的了。
For civil servants coming to Taiwan, the first major thing seems to be finding a house. Houses are available everywhere. You just need to identify one, file a record with the competent authority, receive a seal from the Japanese Property Takeover Committee, or have your own agency write a seal. That house is considered yours.

可是，房子雖然很多，要住却並不容易。日本人搬走的時候，屋內的電綫水道等等，先就有相常的破壞。搬走以後，更會有靑小來把門窗拆去，臉紅心跳「塔塔米」攆走。或者你進宅以後，一不留意，便會有樑上君子光降，把衣物傢具，席捲而去，使你覺得做這新屋子的主人，也不是一件容易的事。
However, although there are many houses, it is not easy to live in them. When the Japanese moved out, the electrical wiring, water pipes, etc. in the house had already been considerably damaged. After moving out, there will be young people who come to tear down the doors and windows, blushing and chasing away the "tatami". Or, after you move in, if you are not careful, there will be gentlemen on the beams who will come and sweep away your clothes, furniture, making you feel that being the owner of this new house is not an easy thing.

話雖這麽說，許多空屋子畢竟有大人先生們住入了。「王侯第宅皆新主，文武衣冠異昔時」，在含灣誰都要興今昔之感吧？
Having said that, many empty houses have been moved into by great men and gentlemen. "The houses of kings and nobles all have new owners, and the attire of civil and military officials is different from the past." Who in Taiwan would not feel a sense of the past and present?

### 答復讀者——醫藥衛生
### Reply to Readers—Medicine and Hygiene

曹文泉問　鄙人服務百貨商店，收入極微，不幸於三十二年四月間，因時常飲酒及强烈運動，不知不覺中雙足浮腫，行動困難，隨後面部及全身亦感浮腫，醫師斷爲慢性腎　炎，當時醫師竭力診治，已得腫退，但體力虛弱，二年來仍時發時愈，苦無斷根良方，　慨　關熱心解救貧病，請示治法。
Cao Wenquan asks: I serve in a department store, and my income is very small. Unfortunately, in April of the 32nd year of the Republic, due to frequent drinking and strenuous exercise, my feet unconsciously became swollen, making it difficult to move. Later, my face and body also became swollen. The doctor diagnosed chronic nephritis. At that time, the doctor tried his best to treat me, and the swelling subsided, but my physical strength was weak. In the past two years, it has recurred from time to time. I have no effective cure. I admire your enthusiasm for rescuing the poor and sick. Please advise on a treatment method.

醫學博土余新恩答病名慢性腎臟炎，無特效藥，浮　有二原因：（二）血中蛋白質由尿中漏出，（二）氯化物滯留體內。補救辦法：（一）多進蛋白質，（二）淡食並少飲水，菜肴因少用鹽而乏味，可以葫菽，醋，葱，或大　等拌味替代。
Doctor of Medicine Yu Xinen answers: The disease is chronic nephritis, and there is no specific medicine. There are two reasons for the swelling: (1) protein in the blood leaks out from the urine, and (2) chloride is retained in the body. Remedial measures: (1) eat more protein, and (2) eat lightly and drink less water. Dishes are bland due to the lack of salt, so they can be replaced with gourds, vinegar, green onions, or garlic to add flavor.

金寳元問　鄙人去秋肛門右邊忽起硬塊，繼則腫脹發炎，痛苦難行，進院開刀割治，至今仍未能收口，而內中又起硬塊，時流濃液，現左肛門邊又起一硬塊，並無腫脹之苦

### Tracking Down Lost Persons

Seeking Mother and Uncle Zhou Jiaji The person I am seeking is Zhou Jiaji, a sergeant of the 638th Regiment of the 208th Division of the Youth Army. He has served in the military for nine years. Due to transportation disruptions, he has been unable to communicate with his family. Recently, he followed the army to Hangzhou, and originally requested leave to go to Shanghai, hoping to reunite with his mother, from whom he had been separated for eight years. Unexpectedly, after arriving in Shanghai, his mother, Chen Wangshi, had disappeared, and his uncle, Zhou Jia君, had also moved elsewhere. Please ask your esteemed newspaper to relay this information to relatives and friends. If anyone knows the whereabouts of his mother and uncle, please send a letter to Chen Chunlin (nicknamed A Lin), No. 29 Changrong Road, Chengdu South Road, Shanghai.

Seeking Wu Kezhen, age 30, from Xueyan Bridge, Wuxi. He worked as a ticket seller for the Jiangnan Motor Company in Nanjing during the July 7th Incident (Marco Polo Bridge Incident). Later, he withdrew westward with the company. To this day, there has been no news of him. His parents are extremely anxious. If any relatives or friends know of his whereabouts, please kindly inform Liu Zian of Li Su Printing Society, No. 56 Jingde Road, Suzhou. Your help would be greatly appreciated.

Seeking Anti-Japanese Comrade He Wuchu Mr. He is from Tinglin, Songjiang, age 24. He was originally a practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine. After the war, he stepped forward and joined the Tinglin branch of the Three People's Principles Youth League, engaging in anti-enemy work. He was once ordered to go to eastern Zhejiang to continue the resistance. For eight long and arduous years, we frequently received letters from him. Who knew that for the past five months or so, there has been no news at all? His mother is shedding tears of old age, deeply distressed. Please, kind and virtuous people, inform us of the truth. The merit of your action will be immeasurable. (Correspondence can be forwarded to Guo Yongzhang, Maogang, Songjiang).

Inquiry Regarding Asia Lin Baosheng Whereabouts of Lin Shisheng, a coppersmith formerly working in the lower levels, are now sought. His mother has sent a letter from overseas. It is hoped that relatives and friends will quickly notify Mr. Wang Hanmin of the Asia General Company. Your help would be appreciated.
