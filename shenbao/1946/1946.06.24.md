### The Three-Person Meeting Continued Yesterday; A Comprehensive Review of Transportation Issues; Communist Troops Still Refuse to Withdraw from Railway Lines

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd Dispatch] Today is a regular Sunday holiday. The government and CCP representatives participating in the military three-person meeting went separately to Marshall's residence on Ninghai Road at 10 a.m. to await the start of the meeting. Following his custom, Marshall went to the military church for worship, and then quickly returned to his residence. The meeting then continued at 10:25 a.m. It is reported that today's meeting conducted a comprehensive review of the issue of restoring transportation. The meeting lasted for two hours and twenty-five minutes, with two breaks in between. The results of the meeting have not been announced. According to well-informed sources, the two sides reached a basic consensus on the removal of bunkers and the standardization of road administration. However, the withdrawal of Communist troops from the railway lines involved the issue of Communist troop stationed areas, and the two sides debated fiercely. It is reported that this matter will be discussed as a special case tomorrow. Only when this problem is resolved can a satisfactory agreement be reached.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd Dispatch] The second meeting of the military three-person meeting held this morning was still chaired by General Marshall. The government representative present was Minister of Communications Yu Dawei. Government attendees included Vice Minister of Communications Ling Hongxun, Director Shi Zhiren, Counselor Bai Zonggan, Director of the First Department of the Ministry of National Defense Xu Langxuan, and Guo Ruhua. CCP attendees included Deputy Chief of Staff Teng Daiyuan and Huang Yifeng and three others. It is reported that Vice Minister Ling brought detailed reports on the damage to various railways awaiting repair and various reference charts and statistical data. The CCP side also brought various reports on the current situation of various sections within the Communist army occupied areas. After the meeting began, Marshall paid close attention to the extent of damage to roadbed sleepers, rails, bridges, culverts, station buildings, and factories. He inquired in particular about the distances between the troop stationed areas of both sides along each route, and frequently stood up to survey various charts temporarily hung in the room for reference. When he learned that the Jinpu, Longhai, and other routes had been damaged dozens or even hundreds of times, he sighed at length, as if deeply saddened.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd Dispatch] It is reported that Zhou Enlai and Yu Dawei met yesterday afternoon around 3 p.m., and separately visited Marshall's residence to discuss the issues of Marshall's arbitration authority, the three issues related to cease-fire, road restoration, and military reorganization, and the issue of Communist army stationed areas, and to exchange opinions. It is understood that the CCP also put forward a new proposal regarding Marshall's arbitration authority. It is reported that the CCP only recognizes that the US representative has the power of execution and interpretation, and still insists that the final decision should be made by the three-party representatives. This is a significant difference from the government's position that the final decision should be determined by the majority. If this matter cannot be resolved quickly, it may become a major stumbling block in the meeting. According to a neutral person, the CCP has repeatedly praised Marshall as the most impartial mediator and has repeatedly expressed trust in and admiration for Marshall. Therefore, it should not be insincere and deliberately use this difficult problem to carry out its conspiracy of negotiating while fighting.

Yu Dawei Visited the Chairman After the Meeting

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd Dispatch] After the meeting of the three-person group adjourned today, reporters met with Minister of Communications Yu Dawei at his private residence. Mr. Yu stepped out of the car with the lightest of steps, appearing carefree and very happy. Reporters focused on the "transportation" issue, which was the focus of today's meeting, and immediately asked for Mr. Yu's opinion. Mr. Yu said, "Reporting my happy attitude to the readers is enough for them to know a glimpse of the meeting." He then laughed and said, "I have never been so happy as I am today." Finally, he added, "Good news can be announced on June 30th." It is reported that Mr. Yu was busy all day today and visited the Chairman twice after the meeting to discuss matters. It is reported that the three-person meeting will continue to discuss transportation issues tomorrow morning. It is understood that a partial agreement was reached today.

Government Representatives Exchange Opinions

[United Press, Nanjing, 22nd Dispatch] Government representatives Sun Ke, Shao Lizi, Wu Tiecheng, Chen Lifu, Wang Shijie, and Zhang Lisheng held a meeting this morning to discuss the content of the proposal put forward by CCP representative Zhou Enlai and exchange opinions. After the meeting, the original proposal was submitted to Chairman Chiang. The fourth point in the proposal, regarding the convening of the second Political Consultative Conference, was reserved. It was said that this issue could be left for discussion by the various parties after the military issue is resolved.

### Ministry of National Defense Spokesman Denounces the CCP's Suggestions; Communist Troops Repeatedly Violate the Cease-Fire Order; Now They Are Creating Extraneous Issues in an Attempt to Delay

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd Dispatch] Today, the spokesperson of the Ministry of National Defense issued an important statement: Recounting how, since the first cease-fire agreement was issued on January 10th of this year, and after the second cease-fire public announcement was issued on June 6th, Communist troops have repeatedly violated the cease-fire order, expanded their troops without authorization, attacked the National Army, destroyed transportation, attacked towns, and detained or harmed government and American group representatives. All the facts of violating orders, breaking faith, and harming the people are listed. The spokesperson also refuted the four suggestions proposed by the CCP in its letter to the Chairman after the announcement of the third cease-fire order, considering them to be faithless, attempting to create extraneous issues, and deliberately delaying. In particular, the fourth item is even more empty. For example, advocating for reopening the Political Consultative Conference and reorganizing the government before military conflicts cease equates political issues with the urgent task of ceasing fire. Their delaying tactics are very obvious.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd Dispatch] The spokesman of the Ministry of National Defense stated a moment ago: On the 21st of this month, the government, with the utmost forbearance, extended the deadline for the order to cease pursuit and advance by another eight days before the expiration of the fifteen-day period. This move was indeed giving the Communist Party another chance to awaken. However, the CCP representatives sent a letter to the government representatives, putting things upside down and creating new problems. The facts that are known to the world can prove that the CCP's move is clearly lacking sincerity and is intended to delay. The CCP delegation stated in its letter: "The military reorganization plan proposed by the government side was completely unexpected, attempting to move the CCP troops out of the major cities and railway lines during the military reorganization period in order to eliminate them," etc. Their intention is obviously to permanently occupy the major cities and railway lines that were illegally seized by the Communist troops after the Japanese surrender, creating a situation of separatism, unwilling to obey the government's dispatch. This not only undermines the unification of military and political orders, but also wants to create obstacles to the basic principles of the military reorganization plan agreed upon by both sides, and completely expresses their lack of sincerity for peace with the resolute tone of "cannot be considered." The letter also stated: "If the ceasefire is not implemented immediately, the people will suffer, the country will be devastated, and the bleak future is truly unimaginable." If the Communist Party's intention is expressed in good faith, then after January 10th of this year, the facts of the Communist army's expanding its troops, attacking the National Army, destroying transportation, attacking cities and towns, and detaining or harming government and American group representatives, etc., which all violate the cease-fire order, I wonder how the Communist Party representatives will explain themselves. Even in terms of recent facts, since the second announcement of the cease-fire order on June 7th, the National Army, except for self-defense, all units have firmly defended their original defenses and have not pursued or attacked. On the contrary, the Communist army has launched a full-scale offensive. For example, in the Northeast, they seized Fuyu, Taolaizhao, Lafa, etc. In eastern Hebei, they are currently concentrating a large amount of military force in the area north of Lulong and Luanxian, intending to cut off the traffic on the Beining Road. In Shanxi, they seized Yixian and Shuoxian. In Shandong, they are particularly active. On the Jinpu Line, they seized Dezhou, Tai'an, and Zaozhuang, etc. On the Jiaoji Line, they seized Mingshui, Longshan, Zhoucun, Zhangdian, Jiaozhou, Chengyang, and other stations, and besieged Jinan with 100,000 troops and attacked Huangbu and Baihe Water Source in Qingdao with 60,000 troops, surrounding Qingdao, and continued to destroy the important railway lines in North China. For example, on the Pinghan Line, from Yuanshi in the south to Fengle, a distance of more than 200 kilometers, is occupied by the Communist army, and repair is not allowed. The Niucheng Wenxi section and the Wenxi Shicun section of the Tongpu Line have recently been destroyed by the Communist army. On the Jinpu Line, in addition to the area near Jinan, from Dangjiazhuang in the south to Liguo Station north of Xuzhou, and from Sangzidian in the north to Cangxian in Hebei, are all destroyed by the Communist army in sections and cannot be repaired to this day. After the Ministry of Communications made its best efforts to repair the Jiaoji Line, almost all of it was open to traffic. However, recently the Communist army, in order to cut off the traffic between Qingdao and Jinan, not only seized important stations along the line, but also destroyed them again. After the second ceasefire order, the Communist army not only continued to perform its old trick of seizing cities and railways and destroying transportation, but also openly harmed government group members Major Lei Fenqiang and Guo Ziqi, the translator of the Xinxiang group. These are all current facts. The so-called agreement to ceasefire by the Communist Party representatives is still an attempt to cover up its consistent trick of freely attacking the National Army and allowing the National Army to be defeated on all sides. Furthermore, the four items proposed by the CCP representatives in their recommendations cannot avoid betraying the facts, attempting to create extraneous issues, and deliberately delaying.

### Understanding the Suffering of the People in the Northeast; Hoping the CCP Acts Prudently; Wan Fulin Claims to Advocate Organizing and Training the Masses

[Our Newspaper, Yang, 23rd Dispatch] Mr. Wan Fulin, a member of the Political Committee of the Northeast Xingying, told reporters that people in the Northeast currently hope that Mr. Mo Dehui will come to the Northeast as soon as possible. He has already asked General Ma Zhanshan, who is going to Beijing, to convey this intention to Mr. Mo Dehui. It is generally believed that Mr. Mo understands the situation in his hometown better than others. Mr. Wan returned to his hometown in the Northeast for the first time after the restoration of the Northeast, and many local elders and villagers were delighted to meet him. He said that in the future, he is willing to contribute his humble opinions to the authorities in order to benefit the local area. He also said: The current situation in the Northeast really needs peace, and I especially hope that the Communist Party understands the suffering of the people and acts prudently. I advocate organizing and training the masses, which has been adopted by Chairman Chiang, because the military force is limited, but the power of the masses is infinite.

### The So-Called "People's Representatives" Are Accused by Refugees from Northern Jiangsu

A Tragic and Passionate Scene at Zhenjiang Station

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd Dispatch] Ma Xulun and his party have been escorted into the city by the security authorities. Ma and others were questioned by refugees at the station, and fortunately no accidents occurred. However, the emotions of the refugees were very agitated. The authorities will decide how to deal with Ma and others after verifying their identities.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd Dispatch] More than ten people, including Ma Xulun, Bao Dasan, Chen Zhenzhong, Kui Yanfang, Hu Ziying, Sheng Pihua, Zhang Tongbo, Chen Lifu, Yan Baohang, and Lei Jieqiong, who claimed to be people's representatives, came to Nanjing from Shanghai today, claiming to be representatives of more than fifty people's organizations in Shanghai, to oppose the civil war and petition the government, the CCP, and Marshal Marshall. When the train arrived in Zhenjiang, because the refugees did not yet know that Ma and others were self-proclaimed representatives, thousands of refugees from northern Jiangsu gathered at Zhenjiang Station and sent five representatives to demand three points: (1) Please ask Ma Xulun to get off the train and talk. (2) Please ask Mr. Ma to listen to the refugees' reports on the atrocities of the Communist army in northern Jiangsu, and please convey them to Chairman Chiang and Marshal Marshall, asking them to send them back to their hometowns. At that time, Ma Xulun claimed that he was representing the people of Shanghai to go to Beijing and refused to get off the train. At that time, some refugees even wanted to lie down on the railway track to beg Mr. Ma to get off the train. Fortunately, the station staff conveyed their request politely, and the train was able to leave. Ma and others arrived in Beijing at 7 o'clock. As soon as they arrived at the platform, refugees from northern Jiangsu who had gathered at the station complained to Ma and others, saying, "If you are people's representatives, please take us to see Zhou Enlai and ask him to answer our questions about restoring traffic and stopping conflicts." Ma replied that he was going to visit Chairman Chiang, since the crowd was agitated and he could not cope with it. The crowd shouted, "If you don't take us refugees to see Zhou Enlai, then you are not real representatives!" Then the refugees shouted, "We don't want democratic swindlers. We ordinary people and elementary school students cannot be your political gambling capital for a lifetime." At that time, the crowd was boiling and pushing each other. Then someone pretended to shout, "The representatives have been beaten." However, when this newspaper's reporter saw Mr. Ma in a reception room at the station, he only saw that he was tired. Then Yan Baohang, one of the so-called representatives, waved his hands and lectured on a makeshift table, attracting the crowd. At that time, the crowd at the station had reached thousands. Every time they heard him claim to be a people's representative, they shouted, "Take out your credentials!" The refugee representatives who were organized spontaneously also made several demands as follows: (1) The Communist army must withdraw from northern Jiangsu. (2) The Communist army must stop the physical consolation of women. (3) Stop the struggle. (4) Do not forcibly conscript men. (5) We want to go home and have security. (6) Stop the bloody struggle. They also made demands of the representatives of the Democratic League: (1) Do not be the tail of the Communist Party. (2) Stop all political activities in schools. (3) We want to study. (4) We want peaceful unification, not internal chaos. At this time, Ma Xulun, who claimed to be a people's representative, had nothing to say and dared not meet the crowd. At this time, the refugees could not avoid chaos due to grief and disappointment, so the unfortunate incident of some three reporters being mistakenly beaten occurred. Several reporters went to meet Ma and others, and the crowd misunderstood. This also shows that the emotions of the crowd cannot be violated. As of 11 p.m., the Xiaguan Station was still at a stalemate, and the order was maintained by the railway police. This scene of the struggle between "true democracy" and "false democracy" lasted until midnight.

### The Northeast Executive Team is Active; Representatives Depart to Prepare for Work

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 23rd Dispatch] The extension of the cease-fire order has given the Northeast Executive Team an opportunity to be active. Sixteen CCP representatives in Shenyang have gone to Changchun, and another ten will go soon to prepare to work with government and American representatives in various places. Wang Tianren and others from the 30th Team will go to Haicheng, and Cai Wanyou from the 29th Team has transferred from Siping to Hailong. Another group of government personnel left Ping for Shenyang and then transferred to Changchun the night before yesterday, accompanied by Chen Gonghui and others from the 36th Team. However, it is reported that the Communist Party refused to allow government team representatives to go to Harbin, so the Northeast military authorities also refused Communist representatives to go to Haicheng, and offered to allow government representatives to go to Harbin as an exchange condition. This is the reason why the Haicheng team departed later. Du Yuming said that he had received the order to extend the cease-fire on the evening of the 21st and had ordered compliance. However, he said that he would no longer say much in the future to avoid misunderstandings, but he claimed that the authorities' determination to take over the sovereignty of the Northeast has not changed and that if there is no result after the 30th, they will continue to advance.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 22nd Dispatch] The Shenfu Security Brigade of the Communist army, consisting of about 200 people, entrenched near Xiaozhaizi, about 70 kilometers east of Fushun, attacked the National Army near Yingpan on the morning of the 20th. The military authorities have telegraphed the Executive Headquarters to lodge a serious protest with the Communist Party.

### Belode Suffers from Typhoid Fever; Successor Not Yet Decided

[United Press, Nanjing, 22nd Dispatch] Marshall Special Envoy Headquarters announced today that Brigadier General Belode, the head of the Executive Group of the Beiping Military Mediation Executive Headquarters, has a severe case of typhoid fever and must leave his post and return to the United States. Belode went to Changchun as the US representative of the advance team of the Military Mediation Department, contracted the disease there, and flew back to Beiping for emergency treatment. A Marshall spokesperson said: "This is an example of a young American officer sacrificing his health for the peace of China." Belode is only thirty-two years old and is the youngest officer in the US Army, and is also a cornerstone of Marshall's peace organization. Marshall's loss of this person will be a serious blow, especially at this critical time. As soon as Belode is able to travel, he will fly back to the United States.

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 23rd Dispatch] Three tragic explosions occurred on the Yanjiang Avenue in Hankou on the 22nd at noon, killing four people and seriously injuring twelve people.

[United Press, Nanjing, 23rd Dispatch] Marshal Marshall now needs to find a new head of the executive department of the Military Mediation Department to replace Brigadier General Belode.

### U.S. State Department Releases Secret Documents on the Northeast Incident, Detailing U.S. Diplomatic Activities in 1931, Stimson as a Strong Behind-the-Scenes Figure in the League of Nations at the Time

[United Press, Washington, 22nd] Secret documents released by the State Department today regarding the Northeast Incident in China in 1931 reveal that then-Secretary of State Stimson spared no effort to seek peaceful coexistence with Japan. Stimson was Secretary of War when the Pearl Harbor incident occurred. The documents declare that Stimson felt that Japan's actions in the Northeast were difficult to "appropriately mediate," but believed that China's excessive "hostility" towards Japan was also one of the causes of the Northeast Incident. He also accused China of "eagerly trying to involve all the countries of the world in the whirlpool to fight against Japan." The document quotes Stimson as saying: "We should sympathize with this matter, but we do not want to fight Japan."

The document only covers the first three months of the Northeast Incident. Japan invaded the Northeast on September 18, 1931. Two months later, the Council of the League of Nations met twice in Paris to consider the situation of the incident. The document reveals for the first time in detail that Stimson played a strong behind-the-scenes role in the activities of the League of Nations, although the United States had not yet joined the League of Nations at this time. The document declares that Stimson actually "manipulated" most of the League of Nations' activities regarding the Northeast Incident, but was not responsible himself. Stimson also ordered General Charlie David, the informal liaison representative of the United States to the League of Nations at the time, to "grab the collar" of French representative Briand, the chairman of the Council of the League of Nations, to prevent the League of Nations from "acting too hastily" against Japan. He feared that the League of Nations' strong actions would make Japan "ignite."

He also opposed economic sanctions against Japan, because this would be "the first step towards war against Japan." He believed that the League of Nations must be prevented from sending a military investigation team to the Northeast. Stimson told David: "The only thing we care about in the Northeast is to prevent war. We do not care what the result of the solution is, as long as China and Japan can negotiate peacefully."

The document declares that Stimson's advice was encouraged by representatives of the Council of the League of Nations. At the end of 1931, Chinese government officials accused the United States of "sabotaging" what they believed could have been obtained, the League of Nations' "severe condemnation" of Japan. The document states: Stimson secretly "cooperated" with the League of Nations to a greater extent than Americans might have approved if they had known. Stimson did not approve of the League of Nations taking strong action against Japan, but advocated direct negotiations between China and Japan. Japan then voted to reject the League of Nations' proposal to urge it to negotiate and immediately withdraw its troops from the Northeast. The United Kingdom then proposed making some concessions to Japan.

Stimson tried to arrange direct talks with neutral observers. He said: "If Japan refuses, it should be regarded as illegal, and under the effective resistance of China and the spiritual pressure of the world, it should feel besieged on all sides."

In the secret documents published today, there are countless parts that show sympathy for Japan, express regret for its invasion of the Northeast, and are impatient with the Chinese government's "endless long speeches" complaining to Japan.

A month after Japan invaded the Northeast, William Castle, then Deputy Secretary of State, told the Japanese ambassador: "If you think that we hope that the Japanese will withdraw from the Northeast, this is completely wrong... We certainly should not urge or even suggest that Japan completely withdraw from the Northeast, because the Japanese army is in the Northeast based on the provisions of the treaty, which is very obvious."

Castle also told the Japanese ambassador that the United States' opinion on the Northeast Incident was quite "restrained," because many people knew that "the Japanese in the Northeast had endured a lot and continue to exist with troubles."

The secret documents declare that Stimson's actions in the Northeast Incident are very different from those described in his own book "The Crisis in the Far East." In this book, Stimson narrates that he tried to make the British government take strong measures against Japan, but as a result of the British side's cold response, he had to abandon his plan.

Editorial

### Concluding a Far East Four-Power Pact

It has been nearly ten months since the Japanese bandits surrendered and were under the control of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces. The purpose of the Allied control of Japan: in addition to disarming Japan, it is also necessary to reform the threat of Japanese politics. We review General MacArthur's work in controlling Japan, and in these ten months, he has achieved considerable success in eliminating the remnants of the Japanese warlords, eradicating the people's aggressive ideology, and reforming the Japanese political system. However, this control method is not a long-term solution. In order to establish a century-old plan for peace in the Far East, the U.S. State Department has drafted a twenty-five-year treaty for the four powers of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union to disarm Japan, and notified the governments of China, Britain, and the Soviet Union as the basis for the future Far East Four-Power Pact. Today, when the Far East Peace Conference has not yet been convened, the United States' proposal of this Four-Power Pact plan is even more worthy of our attention.

According to the full text of the Four-Power Pact draft released by the U.S. Information Service, summarized, there are the following key points: (1) Establish a four-power control committee to supervise Japan's disarmament and domestic non-defense; (2) Disarm all of Japan's army, navy, and air force, and dissolve the Imperial Headquarters and the General Staff Headquarters, and do not allow the establishment of military or paramilitary institutions, prohibit the manufacture and import of arms, and do not establish naval, land, or air bases; (3) If Japan takes actions that damage or violate this treaty, the signatory countries must immediately take necessary actions in the naval, land, and air forces to stop it; but the measures taken must be reported to the United Nations Security Council; (4) The validity period of the treaty is limited to twenty-five years, and a four-power conference should be convened six months before the expiration date to determine whether the treaty needs to be amended or extended.

From these four key points, its nature is roughly the same as the twenty-five-year treaty for the disarmament of Germany proposed by U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes at the last Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference; its purpose is clearly to prevent the resurgence of aggressive forces and to lay a solid foundation for peace in the Far East. Although the current situation in the Far East has changed due to Japan's defeat, looking to the future, the key to whether peace in the Far East can be maintained for a long time is still in Japan. We should not ignore the defeated Japan in the slightest. On the surface, Japan is enduring the bitter fruits caused by defeat, but in their hearts, they seem to have not yet admitted defeat and firmly believe that after another ten or twenty years, Japan will be able to regroup and determine the outcome. Therefore, the key to peace in the Far East still depends on the effectiveness of the four-power control of Japan. In view of the outbreak of the Second European War, we believe even more that peace must be built on a reasonable basis to be maintained permanently. In dealing with Japan, if one appeals to reason, or relies solely on emotions, and gives the most severe and harsh treatment, or the great powers do not act in unison, or even secretly support Japan's resurgence, then the Germany after the First World War can serve as a warning. Therefore, how to deal with the defeated Japan is not a simple problem, and its impact is even more closely related to our China.

The Four-Power Pact draft proposed by the United States is generally satisfactory, and the governments of China and Britain have also expressed their agreement in principle. The only issue is the Soviet Union, which has not yet replied, and it is not yet known whether it agrees or not. This newspaper's editorial has pointed out more than once that the Soviet Union needs to participate in a twenty-five-year alliance to jointly prevent the resurgence of Germany and Japan. Looking at the recent developments in the international political situation, for the sake of peace in Europe and for the sake of security in the Far East, the Soviet Union should support the two Four-Power Pact drafts successively proposed by the United States. How to deal with the problem of Germany is now left aside for the time being, but how to clean up the defeated Japan is indeed the most serious problem in the Far East at present. We browse modern history, and after each international war, a peace conference is immediately convened to clean up the post-war international mess and seek temporary peace and stability, but the situation after the result of this war is very different. In Europe, Germany surrendered nearly a year ago, but the four powers cannot fully agree to convene a twenty-one-nation peace conference, which remains to be decided by the foreign ministers' conference. In the Far East, because the European stalemate cannot be broken, the Far East issue is even more difficult to resolve, and the general situation is chaotic and needs to be clarified quickly. The U.S. proposal is a very wise move and will make a great contribution to the future situation in the Far East. Soviet diplomats are of course very aware of this, and if the Soviet Union expresses its agreement, it will be the starting point for cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union in the Far East, and it is also a turning point in the world situation from "division" to "unity."

The post-war situation in the Far East is because the United States and the Soviet Union have different opinions on Japan, Korea, and the Northeast issue in our country, and there is almost a situation of accumulating incompatibility. After the Moscow Three-Power Foreign Ministers Conference, a temporary compromise was reached on the issues disputed by both sides, and the situation in the Far East was also full of bright and peaceful scenes. However, in the past six months, these issues have not been thoroughly resolved, especially the issue of Japan. The Soviet Union often blames the United States for "taking over," and the United States is also wary of the Soviet Union. Therefore, in order to correct the source, it is indeed urgent for the four powers to sign a treaty to supervise Japan's disarmament and prevent the resurgence of aggressive forces.

Finally, we hope that the two Four-Power Pact drafts proposed by the United States can be established at the same time, so as to establish two solid pillars for European peace and Far East security.

### Wuxi Xibao and Daxibao Newspapers Destroyed by Demobilized Military Officers Yesterday, Both Newspapers Lost Almost Everything, Two Employees Seriously Injured, Commander Tang Personally Inspects and Decides to Deal with It Severely

[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 23rd] Xibao and Daxibao newspapers in this city were destroyed by more than 200 students from the 17th Army Officers Corps at 11:00 AM on the 23rd because they published news on the 22nd about "military-like people behaving lawlessly." The business, editorial, and printing departments of Xibao were destroyed, and two senior employees were seriously injured, with losses of more than 100 million yuan. For a time, the people of the whole city were panicked and warned each other to close the market. The society was in a chaotic state. Military police were dispatched unarmed to persuade them, but they were also beaten. A major general senior officer of the Officers Corps suppressed the scene, but not only did it not work, but he was also insulted. The situation only eased slightly at about 1:00 PM. Commander Tang Enbo learned of this and went to inspect in person and made a statement, responsible for guaranteeing freedom of speech and maintaining the safety of news practitioners, and decided to convene relevant parties on the 24th to discuss solutions.

[This City Report] Wuxi Xibao and Daxibao were suddenly wantonly destroyed by more than 200 students from the 17th Demobilized Officers Corps of the Ministry of Military Affairs at about 12:00 noon yesterday (23rd).

Military Officer Corps Students Disturbing the People Was Published in the Newspaper

According to the person in charge of the Shanghai office of Xibao: The 17th Demobilized Officers Corps of the Ministry of Military Affairs, with about 4,000 people, has been living in the Xixiang area of Wuxi. Rong Shixing, a farmer from four households in Wubao and Shisijia, Rongxiang Town, was living in the home of Wu Longbang, a member of the corps. A few days ago, due to a minor incident, he had a quarrel with Rong, and gathered more than a dozen companions to drag Rong out and beat him severely, which aroused a unanimous market strike by the villagers in the town, demanding punishment for the murderer. The reporter reported the facts truthfully, and the newspapers published it on the 22nd. Tao Liu, the commander of the Officers Corps, learned of this and summoned local people in the afternoon to inquire about the truth. Unexpectedly, more than 100 students under the command of the corps destroyed the reporter's residence, Erjia, a local store, and the town government. Each newspaper was preparing to interview in detail, and at the same time received a notice from the corps headquarters, instructing them not to record it for the time being, and agreed to convene relevant military and police personnel at the xiang government yesterday (23rd) to discuss solutions, hoping that each newspaper would publish it at the same time after the results of the discussion, so as not to stimulate the emotions of the military and civilians. In order to settle the matter, each newspaper immediately followed suit. At the same time, reporters were sent to the xiang with representatives of the city defense department and the county government yesterday morning to attend the meeting. The meeting started at 9:00 AM, still presided over by Commander Tao.

More than 200 People Commit Murder, Two Newspapers Are Almost Completely Destroyed

Unexpectedly, more than 200 students of the corps had already sneaked into the city, first went to Daxibao, and wantonly destroyed the furniture, doors and windows of the business department and editorial department. The newspaper immediately reported to the city defense department, and more than 30 armed soldiers from the department rushed to suppress it, but they were outnumbered and helpless. As a result, one inspector and one member were beaten and injured. Afterwards, the students rushed to the Xibao hall in swarms. At that time, the newspaper had closed the gate tightly. The students immediately climbed over the wall and entered, and first destroyed all the front door department, business department, editorial department, general manager's office, telecommunications room, data room, and kitchen. The students who caused the trouble said that the staff of the newspaper hall had heard the news and temporarily avoided them. Some of them turned to the county government and stated that they wanted the county magistrate to hand over the presidents and editors-in-chief of the newspapers. Because the county magistrate was not there, they could not get what they wanted, so they returned to the Xibao printing department and destroyed the typesetting room, casting equipment, and so on. Zhu Xuequan (currently a county senator), the manager of the newspaper printing department, and one worker were injured because they could not escape. Another three workers were slightly injured. It lasted for more than an hour before they left triumphantly.

Commander Tang Was Furious, Guaranteed to Punish the Murderers and Compensate

When the incident happened, the local military police were isolated and weak and could not suppress it. The local people rushed to report the incident, and the order was very chaotic. After Commander Tang was reported, he was furious and immediately drove to personally inspect the damage. At the same time, he immediately summoned the relevant leaders and the persons in charge of the victimized newspaper to talk and firmly declared: (1) Be responsible for punishing the murderers, (2) Compensate for the losses, (3) Absolutely guarantee freedom of the press, (4) Absolutely guarantee the safety of news personnel. From now on, each newspaper will send special armed soldiers to protect them. The detailed method will be discussed in detail at 8:00 AM on the 24th. The participants expressed their admiration for Commander Tang's fair measures. All the newspapers in Wuxi originally intended to suspend publication unanimously, as a rear guard, but they were touched by Commander Tang's enthusiasm for the newspaper industry and decided to continue publishing as usual. In addition to issuing a joint edition and waiting for a legal solution, the Xibao board of directors convened a meeting overnight to report to Chairman Wu Zhihui and ask for instructions on the aftermath. Daxibao also urgently telegraphed the publishers Wu Shaoshu and Yao Dongsheng to ask for instructions.

### Date of the European Peace Conference The Four Foreign Ministers Fail to Reach Agreement Will Intensify Work to Conclude Negotiations Soon Triest Issue Consulted With Italy and Yugoslavia

[Our Dispatch] London, 23rd - Broadcasting: The Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference has entered its final stage. Starting tomorrow, the foreign ministers will meet twice daily, hoping to conclude negotiations by the end of next week.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 22nd] The Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference is currently striving to convene a peace conference of 21 European nations on July 15th of this year. This matter was suggested by the US delegation and agreed to in principle by the British and French delegations. However, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov expressed dissent, preventing an agreement from being reached. When US Secretary of State Byrnes proposed the above suggestion, he pointed out that the entire peace plan should be drafted before the UN General Assembly convenes in September of this year. He also stated that the issues of Germany and Austria should be submitted for review only after the invitations to the 21-nation peace conference have been issued. However, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov disagreed, stating that many important issues in the various peace treaties remain to be resolved, and it would be dangerous to immediately determine the date for convening the conference. British Foreign Secretary Bevin then proposed postponing the final decision on convening the conference for another week. Regarding the issues of the borders of Austria and the disposition of the Italian fleet, a comprehensive consideration was not possible because the report to be submitted by the committee of experts has not yet been completed. Regarding the issue of the Dodecanese Islands' affiliation, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov requested a postponement of the discussion, stating that he would consult with the Greek Ambassador to France this afternoon. The next meeting of the Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference is scheduled for the 24th of this month, at which time the issues of the borders of Italy and Austria, the borders of France and Italy, and the distribution of the Italian fleet will be discussed. As suggested by British Foreign Secretary Bevin, the Four Power Foreign Ministers also decided to hold two meetings daily.

[Reuters, Paris, 22nd] It was previously reported that the Four Power Foreign Ministers would prepare to accept the compromise of international co-management of Trieste, which is the dispute between Italy and Yugoslavia that has stalled the Italian peace treaty. However, no decision has yet been reached on this compromise, and only preliminary opinions have been exchanged. It is expected that the Four Power Foreign Ministers will take advantage of Sunday to consult with the governments of Italy and Yugoslavia on how to resolve this compromise, and a draft is expected to be prepared in the early part of next week.

[Associated Press, Paris, 22nd] Italy presented the Foreign Ministers Conference with a note protesting the decision to postpone the discussion of colonial issues for another year, during which time the peace treaty with Italy will be signed, and Italy will relinquish all sovereignty over its colonies.

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 22nd] Regarding the issue of Italy's western border, the Italian Socialist Party recently held a meeting and issued a communiqué protesting the Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference's willingness to sacrifice a portion of the Italian people. It stated, "The Socialist Party's design committee will seek a fair peace for the Italian people. The Italian people should be considered victims of Fascism, not accomplices."

[Reuters, London, 22nd] The Hungarian delegation, led by Hungarian Prime Minister Nagy, concluded discussions with British officials in London after 36 hours and left for Paris today. Before his departure, Nagy stated that he did not discuss loans with the British, but did discuss trade with Britain. Regarding Hungary's reparations to the Soviet Union, he hoped that payments could be postponed for one or two years to allow Hungary to engage in economic recovery.

### Churchill's Speech Advocates Compromise With the Soviet Union

Says World Peace is Indivisible

[Agence France-Presse, London, 22nd]

The United Nations Association held its first annual conference here. The association's chairman, Viscount Cecil, former chairman of the British League of Nations Union, delivered a speech stating that he did not claim to fully understand Soviet policy, but the Soviet Union had many reasons to expect peace. It is known that the Soviet government owns vast lands and must maintain peace in order to develop them. In the initial stages, it seemed to have contributed greatly to supporting international peace organizations. However, the stability of international organizations depends on appropriate compromises and the concept of the highest interests of peace, rather than the security of one country. Peace is indivisible, although it is the saying of a Soviet citizen (referring to former Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov), it seems that the Soviet side has not widely recognized it, which is somewhat regrettable. In today's world, if countries cannot establish international agreements with the Soviet Union, but establish such agreements outside the Soviet Union, it would be the greatest misfortune. Personally, I hope and believe that this unfortunate event will not happen. If it does happen, our responsibility for peace will not be reduced, but rather increased. We must not relax our efforts to ensure the success of the United Nations, but rather intensify them. If we want to maintain peace, we must do so through international action, and only international action can do so.

It stated: The US military has destroyed over one million US dollars worth of heroin and seized other drug stockpiles. Poppy cultivation has also been prohibited.

### Atomic Bomb Tests Purely Experimental and Harbor Attack Styles Conducted Twice Next Month

[Associated Press, aboard the USS Appalanche, atomic bomb test observation ship at Bikini Atoll, 22nd] This ship carries over 150 reporters and broadcasters, departing from Honolulu to the vicinity of the test site. The first press conference was held on board today, announcing that the first atomic bomb test will be purely experimental in nature, rather than a naval warfare test. Naval authorities last fall chose from three possible atomic bomb tests, none of which could include all tests. They are: (1) Purely experimental—measuring the bomb itself, detonating it at high altitude; (2) Harbor attack style—attacking on or below the water surface; (3) Attacking ship style—detonating from deep water. The first test is scheduled to be held on July 1st. The harbor attack test is scheduled to be held on July 20th, detonating in a shallow lake bottom mooring area. The pressure of the first test will be exerted on the front, back, left, and right of the ship and on all decks, etc. Ordinary bombs and torpedoes only exert pressure on one side and crush the side under pressure. Because it is purely experimental in nature, the ships will be arranged safely to determine which ships can be preserved and the limits and distances for the safety of ships and people.

High Heat Can Melt Copper and Iron

As for the impact of this bomb on jeeps, trucks, airplanes, and other military equipment, it cannot be determined until after the test. This equipment will be placed on the deck at carefully selected distances. The internal heat and blast of the bomb are approximately 100 million degrees Fahrenheit. Scientists will study the impact on copper plate turret shells, which may melt. There has never been such a huge and high-temperature furnace in the world for this kind of test.

### Final Exercise Today Dropping the Fourth Bomb

[Reuters, New York, 22nd] The flagship USS McKinley, which is conducting the atomic bomb tests, telegraphed today that due to bad weather since the atomic bomb test fleet arrived at Bikini Atoll, the atomic bomb dropping exercise has been postponed to Monday.

[Central News Agency, Kwajalein Island, 22nd Associated Press] The atomic bomb test is scheduled to be held on the 24th. US Army Air Force personnel who will drop, photograph, and record this historic fourth atomic bomb completed their final practice yesterday. Colonel Brancha, commander of the Flying Attack Group, said that we are ready and can drop it today. We dropped the bomb by Shen Nuo within 500 yards of the test ship USS Nevada, but I dare say that you will see on the day of the test that the bomb will land much closer than the above distance.

Footage Will Be 60,000 Feet Long

The crew of the B-29 bomber No. 354, which will drop the fourth atomic bomb, said that on the day of the test, 14 tense and extremely confident aviators will carry out this flight of only 45 miles. US Army Air Force photographers are also ready and can immediately capture footage up to 60,000 feet in length. The length of film used for ordinary films is more than what is needed for ten full-length Hollywood films. A total of 180 movie cameras and 120 ordinary cameras will be used to record the entire process of the atomic bomb test.

### English Girl With a Compassionate Heart Wants to Suffer for Animals

[Reuters, London, 22nd] Miss Dinstell of Lee, wrote to US Ambassador Harriman, volunteering to suffer for animals. The letter stated that if the authorities believe it is necessary to use animals for atomic bomb tests, please use humans for the tests and do not harm ignorant animals. I have made this decision after careful consideration and ask that it not be taken lightly. Miss Ding had previously asked the US Embassy to forward a protest to the US government against the use of animals for testing.

### Railways and Airports in Iranian Azerbaijan Still Under Soviet Control; Roosevelt's Grandson Briefly Detained

[United Press International, Tehran, 22nd] Iranian Foreign Ministry officials declared today that the Soviet Union still controls ten miles east and west of Azerbaijan province, and the airport at Pahlavi, a Black Sea summer resort, opposes the landing of planes piloted by American airmen. A regularly scheduled Iranian Airlines flight to Pahlavi was therefore canceled yesterday. Iranian Airlines is an auxiliary company of the World Air Transport Association. An official of the Iranian State Railways also mentioned two days ago that the Soviet Union still controls the Azerbaijan railway. (Note: The Soviet Union announced last month that it had completely withdrawn from Azerbaijan). U.S. Military Attaché to Tehran, Lieutenant Colonel Zanserkes, returned today from Tabriz, the capital of Azerbaijan, reporting that he and three adjutants had been detained for eight hours by the democrats there. According to a U.S. Embassy spokesman, a protest has been lodged with the Iranian government. Among those detained with Lieutenant Colonel Sykes was Captain Archie Roosevelt, grandson of the late U.S. President Roosevelt. This flight to Tabriz had been approved by all Iranian authorities, including customs and public security personnel, so the reason for the detention is unknown. The U.S. Consul in Tabriz, Rosha, has returned to Tehran with the others.

[Reuters, Tehran, 22nd] A government spokesman said that the Soviet Red Cross had invited Princess Polive, sister of the Iranian King, to visit eight major Soviet cities, including Moscow, Kiev, Stalingrad, Leningrad, and Kharkov. Because the Soviet delegation has not yet arrived in Tabriz, the central government has not been able to receive the Tabriz-Jolfa railway near the Soviet border from the Soviet side.

Tehran Radio reported that three government representatives will go to Kurdistan tomorrow to implement the government's employment reform plan.

### Two-Gun Hero, Impoverished and Ill, Reluctant to Recount the Past

### U.S. Undertakes Comprehensive Research on Long-Range Rockets

Capable of hitting ships hundreds of miles away, with speeds exceeding five times the speed of sound.

[United Press International, Washington, 22nd] The U.S. Army today requested funding from the House Appropriations Committee for next year's research work. According to Colonel Lee Ji, acting director of the Research and Development Division, we should anticipate that other countries will develop a long-range weapon that can cross the ocean, so the overall research plan must include countermeasures. In addition, the military is planning to study a missile that can be launched from the U.S. coast and hit ships hundreds of miles away. A detailed research plan was drawn up with the Radio Corporation of America last June and will be completed soon. The second step will be to study a missile that can not only hit targets hundreds of miles away moving towards the United States, but also flies so high and fast that it is practically impossible for ships to defend against it. This weapon can be called unparalleled in modern coastal defense weaponry.

Electric Control

The military has also contracted with General Electric to study long-range, ground-controlled launchers. These large rockets can travel at speeds exceeding five times the speed of sound (the speed of sound in air is about 1,100 feet per second) and can be controlled by complex mechanisms to ascend into the sky and land on targets thousands of miles away with pinpoint accuracy. The War Department had previously announced a molten metal jet weapon that could be used to counter atomic rockets or aircraft carrying atomic bombs.

### Huseini Goes to Alexandria, Britain Has No Intention to Request Extradition, But Will Not Allow Him to Engage in Political Activities Again; Announcement of the Establishment of a New Arab Organization

[Reuters, Cairo, 22nd] According to unconfirmed reports here, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Huseini, has gone to Alexandria with King Farouk of Egypt.

[United Press International, Cairo, 22nd] The Egyptian Group Party issued a statement today demanding that the Egyptian government grant Huseini full freedom so that he can serve Palestine. The statement said that the Mufti's resumption of political activities does not violate any laws, and any restrictions on his freedom would be inhumane and would weaken Egypt's position in the Arab world. At the same time, the Muslim Brotherhood also made the same request to King Farouk of Egypt.

[Reuters, London, 23rd] A Foreign Office spokesman said today that the British government has instructed its ambassador to Egypt to negotiate with the Egyptian government regarding the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem remaining in Egyptian territory. Well-informed sources here believe that British Ambassador to Egypt, Campbell, has been instructed to inquire about the Egyptian government's intentions towards the Mufti and to state that Britain wants Egypt to guarantee that he will not engage in political activities, but it is not believed that Britain will request the extradition of the Mufti.

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 22nd] The newly organized four-member Palestine Arab High Committee has notified the Palestinian government of its establishment. It is said that the position of chairman of the committee will be reserved for the Mufti Huseini, the vice-chairman is the Mufti's brother, Jamal, the secretary-general is Kalidi, and the other two members are Hilmi and Goley. The Mufti was originally the chairman of the Arab Higher Committee, which was dissolved due to the Arab riots of 1936, and was reorganized and established in 1945.

### Bishop Chen's Special Honor in England; Accepts Offerings from All English Dioceses; Presides over Special Prayer Mass

[Agence France-Presse, London, 22nd] Bishop Chen, the first Bishop of Shanxi Province in China, escaped the eyes of Japanese special agents during the Anti-Japanese War, secretly went to Shanghai, and flew to London to accept offerings. He recently held a special prayer service at St. Paul's Cathedral. It is unprecedented for a Chinese bishop to speak at St. Paul's Cathedral. The Archbishop of Canterbury will present the offerings from the 29 dioceses of England to Bishop Chen to "recognize the progress of the Chinese Church during the war" and as a symbol of "friendship between the peoples of China and England." Bishop Chen will go to York City next month to accept offerings from that district.

### Unprecedented Major Meteor Shower to Appear This Autumn; Astronomers' Startling Prediction

[Associated Press, Cambridge, 22nd] If astronomers' predictions come true, on a morning in mid-October this year, countless meteors will appear, resulting in an unprecedented major meteor shower. The reason for the meteor shower appearing on a morning in mid-October is that the Earth will pass near a comet, reaching a point 135,000 miles from the path of the Giacobini-Zinner comet. The comet passed through this point only eight days earlier, and the Earth will approach the comet's path at this point. The largest meteor shower occurred in 1933, astonishing the world. After the news spread from Europe, it constituted the front-page news of various newspapers. In a few hours, more than 400 meteors appeared every second. Because the same comet has been rediscovered, this historically significant major meteor shower will appear. However, in 1933, the Earth passed about 500,000 miles from the comet's orbit, which is three times farther than predicted this time. At that time, the comet passed through that point 80 days earlier than the Earth, not eight days, so the meteor shower that will appear in 1946 will be larger than the Giacobini meteor shower of 1933.

The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department stated on the matter: the reason for the arrest was due to their violent behavior, trespassing on houses, and obstructing current business. More than 500 employees of Yomiuri Shimbun held another meeting yesterday and pointed out that the arrest was due to a conspiracy by the company.

### General Assembly of the Chamber of Commerce; Three Central Ministers Attended and Delivered Addresses; Hoping for a Sound Organization, Requiring Unity and Solidarity to Save the Industrial Crisis, Advocating Increasing Revenue and Reducing Expenditure

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce held its 9th General Assembly of all members yesterday morning at the Chamber's address on Henan North Road. It was also the first General Assembly of all members since the victory. Chen Lifu, Minister of Organization of the Central Government, Gu Zhenggang, Minister of Social Affairs, and Wang Yunwu, Minister of Economic Affairs, came to Shanghai from Beijing to attend and deliver addresses. The city's leaders present included Mayor Wu Guozhen, Wu Shaoshu, Chairman of the City Party Department, Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, and more than 1,500 people from more than 200 units (various industry guilds), gathered together, a grand occasion unprecedented. The Presidium of the General Assembly consisted of Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Xu Jigang, Jin Runxiang, and Ge Jichen. The meeting opened at 9:30 am. After performing the formalities, the Presidium Chairman Wang Xiaolai delivered an opening speech, stating: At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, the Chamber painstakingly maintained itself in the concessions, and was then forced to move to Hong Kong. Later, it followed the government and moved to the wartime capital, always supporting the national policy of resisting Japan and building the country, and engaging in the work of resisting Japan and building the country. After the victory, it was very gratifying to be able to return to Shanghai. The reorganization work of the guilds has been roughly completed since the Chamber resumed operations in October. In the future, there will be many facilities. Qi everyone will work together to achieve success.

Chen Lifu Next, Chen Lifu, Minister of Organization of the Central Government, delivered a speech, saying: Shanghai is the center of industry and commerce, and has the role of leading the country's industry and commerce. The purpose of the Anti-Japanese War is to build the country. We want to build a modern country, which is to "industrialize." Everyone present has a very important mission for building the country. In this great era, the government and the people must work hard on both sides. The people must have sound social organizations, and the government must have perfect economic policies. After the victory, there are still many problems in front of us that need to be solved. There are places where the government's policies need to be revised, and the strength of society is still not enough to cooperate and respond. We must have sound policies and great social strength. The Shanghai business community is the leader of the national business community. Work together to organize a sound chamber of commerce. You can say whatever you want frankly. You can put forward any perfect and specific opinions for the government's reference. To make an industrial and commercial city prosperous, the first is "transportation." Chairman Jiang asked the Communist Party to restore transportation during the 15 days of the ceasefire. The restoration of transportation is closely related to nation-building. I hope the Communist Party will take into account the future of the country and the suffering of the people, and restore transportation as soon as possible. The second is "finance." We must adjust finance so that industry and commerce can benefit from it. The government should consider whether the current financial policy is conducive to the development of industry and commerce. In the trend of democracy, I hope everyone will speak as much as possible and put forward as many opinions as possible. Whoever violates democracy will fail. I am very willing to assist you in realizing your opinions. After Chen finished speaking, the audience applauded warmly.

Gu Zhenggang Then, Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang delivered a speech. Gu first expressed his admiration for the Shanghai business community's efforts to move machines inland and assist in production at the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, and expressed his gratitude to the City Chamber of Commerce for moving from Shanghai to Hong Kong and Chongqing to assist in the Anti-Japanese War. Gu pointed out two major goals of nation-building: (1) political democratization and (2) economic industrialization, which are the established national policies of the central government. He also contributed two points to the Shanghai business community: (1) To improve the knowledge and technology of industry and commerce and improve the ethics of the business community, we must improve the organization of industry and commerce groups and recruit leading figures in various industries. (2) Consolidate international unity. This time, I was ordered by the central government to go to northern Jiangsu to help the victims. In Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Taixian and other places, I saw tens of thousands of victims and devastated villages everywhere. The scene was very miserable. The Communist Party proposed the so-called "three assets" struggle. The so-called "three assets" refers to those who have "qualifications," own "assets," and are rich in "qualifications." All were killed or forced into exile. Therefore, there are many gentry and intellectual classes and industrial and commercial crises among the victims in northern Jiangsu. One is the lack of raw materials, and the rural areas are bankrupt. Where do the raw materials come from? Therefore, if political problems cannot be solved, economic problems are difficult to solve. Gu finally hoped that the business community would pay attention to political issues, support national policies, and overcome economic difficulties.

Wang Yunwu Then, Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu delivered a speech. Yu put forward the four words "increase revenue and reduce expenditure" to solve economic problems. Increasing revenue means striving for production. The responsibility lies with both the government and the people. The government and the people work together. Speaking of reducing expenditure, the first is to promote frugality. The extravagance in Shanghai is even more prevalent than before the war. It is hoped that the Chamber of Commerce will lead various industry associations to promote frugality.

Mayor Wu Then, Mayor Wu gave a speech, pointing out the two major crises in the current business community: (1) the crisis of guarding, the domestic business community cannot compete with foreign business communities, (2) the internal crisis, the domestic business community cannot develop due to various problems, and hopes that the business community will cooperate with the government to overcome the difficulties. Then Wu Shaoshu, Chairman of the City Party Department, and Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, successively delivered speeches. At around 11 o'clock, everyone took a group photo and passed a congratulatory telegram to Chairman Jiang. (Attached names) Finally, the Presidium Xu Jigang, Jin Runxiang, and Ge Jichen reported on the Chamber's affairs and adjourned the meeting. The meeting continued at 2 pm to discuss the articles of association and proposals, and elect directors and supervisors. Finally, a temporary motion was passed to organize a petition delegation to go to Beijing to petition the government, asking the government to adopt the suggestions of the General Assembly and build a memorial stone tablet to praise the Chamber's leadership of various guilds' loyalty to supporting the Anti-Japanese War, and more than ten other cases. The meeting was successfully closed at 7 pm.

List of Directors and Supervisors Directors: Luo Qinghua, Xu Xiaochu, Jin Runxiang, Ge Jichen, Wang Xianqing, Xu Jigang, Yu Zuoting, Hu Xiyuan, Qian Yongming, Wu Yunchu, Pan Shihao, Tu Kaizheng, Xu Xueyu, Shou Wei, Yang Bei, Zhu Shangyi, Zhang Wenkui, Liu Jingji, Hong Fuxiang, Shen Rixin, Ye Suochu, Cai Xintao, Huang Zhongming, Lu Yinggeng, Xu Ziwei, etc. 25 people.

Telegram to Chairman To Respect

Jiang Junjian, Chairman of the Nanjing National Government: In recent years, the whole world has been in a state of fragmentation. Our country has been in the military for the longest time, and it is extremely difficult to support the decline and revive the waste. I am pleased to hear that Jun Zuo has used great wisdom and courage to stabilize the situation and permanently stabilize the country. From now on, economic construction will be on the right track. The chaos in China has been curbed, and global peace depends on it. At this time when the business community is gathering together, the masses are hoping for relief. I respectfully send a telegram to take the place of offering help, and I only hope for your approval. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce 9th General Assembly.

### Shanghai Journalist Delegation Returns to Shanghai from Zheng via Beijing

The Municipal News Journalist Delegation, which departed from Shanghai on the 6th of this month for an inspection tour of the Jinpu and Longhai Railways, was warmly welcomed along the way. The delegation originally intended to visit the "Liberated Areas" under Communist control, but upon reaching Xuzhou, the Communist forces had just captured Zaozhuang and were pressing on Lincheng, creating a tense situation, preventing the visit. In Zheng, the Guo translator shooting incident by Communist troops from Xiuwu occurred. The Zheng Pacification Commissioner's Office, fearing a deliberate attack by the Communists, could not guarantee the safety of the Shanghai journalists, so they did not inspect the front lines either. After completing their visit in Zheng, the entire journalist delegation left Zheng on the morning of the 22nd, and returned to Shanghai via Xuzhou and Bianjing (Kaifeng), arriving in port at 8:30 last night.

### Typhoon to Strike Shanghai This Afternoon

[Taibao News] Yesterday, Shanghai experienced strong winds all day, but the typhoon is actually expected to arrive near the city this afternoon, so the wind force today will definitely be stronger than yesterday. According to Father Long Xiangqi of the Xujiahui Observatory, this typhoon originated near Taiwan. Yesterday afternoon, the typhoon center was located at 26 degrees North latitude and 121.5 degrees East longitude, moving North-Northwest at a speed of 15 miles per hour. It is expected to reach Shanghai or pass through its northern part around noon today. At that time, the wind force will be approximately 160 kilometers per hour, and the central area will be between 26 and 30 degrees North latitude and 126 and 130 degrees East longitude. According to reports, this typhoon turned north in the sea near Hengchun on the 21st and reached the northeast coast of Hualien Harbor on the morning of the 22nd.

According to the Meteorological Observatory's weather forecast: The Yellow Sea will be cloudy with haze, clear easterly winds, and moderate to locally extremely heavy sea waves. Central China will be cloudy, with localized rain and fog, moderate northerly to easterly winds. Shanghai will be cloudy and increasingly humid, with showers and storms, and strong southeasterly winds. The East China Sea, northern part, will be cloudy, with clear easterly winds and extremely heavy sea waves. The southern part and northern Taiwan, Ishigaki Island, will be cloudy with showers, cyclones, and turbulent sea waves. Temperature for the 23rd: highest 88.4 degrees, lowest 76.8 degrees.

Yesterday, the Bund Observatory hoisted the No. 8 typhoon warning signal black ball and lit the No. 4 red light at night to warn incoming and outgoing ships. It has been found that the maximum level of a typhoon is 12, while the central wind force of this typhoon has reached level 11, with an area of about 50 miles, making it the largest typhoon of the year so far. Judging from the development of the wind force, northern Taiwan has already suffered a serious attack, followed by Wenzhou.

Wind Force of 160 Kilometers per Hour

### Passes Taipei, Heading Towards Fuzhou

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 23rd] The typhoon passed through Yilan and Taipei last night, accompanied by thunderstorms, causing damage to electrical circuits that has not yet been repaired. Taipei is still under heavy cloud cover with drizzling rain. According to the Meteorological Bureau, the typhoon is progressing northwest at a speed of 25 kilometers per hour and is expected to make landfall near Fuzhou around noon today. The typhoon warning for Taiwan Province has been lifted.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] According to a report from the Central Meteorological Bureau at 10:30 p.m. on the 23rd, a major typhoon is approaching China's southeast coast. At 7:00 a.m. on the 23rd, the center was in Fuzhou, and it is now moving northward at a speed of 15 kilometers per hour. If the speed and direction remain unchanged, it could reach Zhejiang Province by the morning of the 24th and will reach the Shanghai and Yangtze River areas. At that time, the speed may increase.

### Life Behind Bars

A common criminal once asked a jailer with a questioning tone, "Why are those traitors living comfortably and carefree in prison, while I am stuck here, annoyed all day long?" The jailer's response was just a mysterious smile. To find the answer to this question, one only needs to look at the families of the traitors who gather daily at the gates of Shanghai Prison to deliver goods. Throughout the year, from food boxes filled with fish, meat, and delicacies to books, newspapers, chess sets, and other entertainment items, even shiny brass beds and brand-new canvas chairs, are delivered inside for them to enjoy comfortably. Under the enemy's iron heel, they certainly had to appear carefree. But what about the daily lives of ordinary prisoners? To find out, the reporter visited Mr. Tian Lixun, the warden of the Shanghai Local Court Detention Center. He graciously guided the reporter on a tour of the facility, allowing us to learn about:

Labor Viewed as an Entertainment Venue

When a person commits a crime and is detained in the detention center of the local court, the first feeling they experience is the narrowness of the "place." We usually call "prison" a "cage." This "cage" is usually seen as a metaphor, but in reality, their "cell" is indeed just a cage of about twenty square feet in size. To put it very pitifully, they are actually much smaller than the places where lions and tigers are caged in the Fuxing Park Zoo. In this small cage, five prisoners must be confined (according to regulations, it is four). They do not feel spacious even when they sit down. When it comes to sleeping at night, you can imagine what a crowded scene it must be. Therefore, every prisoner feels like they are in heaven when they can run a few laps in the yard. However, because the detention center is too small and the number of prisoners currently detained is as high as 2,187, the opportunity for them to take turns visiting "heaven" is only half an hour each in the morning and evening. They also have another form of entertainment, which is labor. "Noble" gentlemen and ladies may be surprised to hear this. But prisoners in the detention center do indeed regard labor as a form of entertainment. They all hope to escape the narrow prison cage and go to the spacious workplace to stretch their paralyzed bodies, revitalize their dejected spirits, temporarily leave the gnawing thoughts of prison life behind, and taste the pearls of life. But such opportunities are only one in four, because the workplace is small and the mobility of prisoners is high. Currently, there are only about 500 people engaged in light manual labor such as sewing, printing, boxing, bagging, woodworking, ironwork, laundry, and hairdressing. Due to the small scale, the surplus is not large. In April, it was only over ten thousand, and in May it was only over one million. According to Warden Tian's estimates, the surplus in June may reach four million yuan. Therefore, the prisoner workers also have a small amount of pocket money to take.

Prisoners from Foreign Countries Also Have it Better

As for their food, it is stipulated that there are two meals in the morning and evening. Each local prisoner receives 21 ounces of dry rice and 4 ounces of vegetables per meal, while foreign prisoners receive 14 ounces of bread and a bowl of beef and vegetable soup. Therefore, those prisoners who do not have family members sending them side dishes every day must sigh, "Prisoners from foreign countries also have it better." This may be a legacy of the concession era. Sick prisoners are given three meals a day of white rice porridge with pickles. Common illnesses can be cured in the infirmary within the facility. More serious illnesses also have nurses to care for them. The inside and outside of the prison cells are also very clean. Recently, DDT has been sprayed twice, and many white worms and fleas have been eliminated, so the threat of infectious diseases has been greatly reduced.

Warden Tian pays great attention to the education of prisoners. Every day, there are two types of education: collective and individual. The former lasts for one hour, while the latter is conducted at any time and is not fixed. But in order to enable them to "reflect on their mistakes behind closed doors" and avoid external stimulation, the focus is on indoctrination methods, and they are not allowed to read books and newspapers freely. No wonder the recently arrested grain official Ren Xingya exclaimed, "They won't even let me read the newspaper!"

From this comparison, the prisoner who sighed that he was "extremely distressed" was indeed not deliberately acting or moaning without illness, and it is inevitable that he would "regret not being ruthless and becoming a traitor in the first place." (Xingtian)

### Arrivals and Departures of Prominent Figures

Wu Zhihui, member of the Central Supervisory Committee, and Wang Yunwu, Minister of Economic Affairs, left Shanghai for Beijing by night train yesterday.

General Wei Lihuang came to Shanghai from Beijing and is expected to arrive this morning.

Mr. Zheng Tianxi, former Chinese judge at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, returned to the country on the evening of the 21st, arriving in Shanghai. He went to Beijing last night.

### Crowds at the North Station Shout Against "People's Representatives" Going to Beijing. Stripped Naked and Painted, Protesting Internal Strife, Beaten and Humiliated. Bizarre Play Performed at Fuxing Park

Ma Xulun and others, claiming to be representatives of the people of this city, planned to petition in Nanjing. Although various groups have declared their denial, Ma and his party of eight still went to the North Station at around 8 a.m. yesterday to take a train to Beijing. At that time, there were nearly ten thousand people gathered at the North Station. Some were there to see them off, shouting slogans against the civil war. Others were protesting against Ma and others for misappropriating their names, shouting slogans against political brokers Lin Handa and road politician Ma Xulun, "Beware of the Communist Party's conspiracy," "Down with youth peddlers," "Oppose impostor representatives," "Oppose internal strife," etc. They also wrote large character slogans. Ma Xulun and others, seeing the chaotic situation inside the station, went into the carriage immediately after arriving at the station and did not go out again. The train departed at 11 a.m. At that time, a group of people set off from the North Station and marched. When passing near the Great World, suddenly dozens of students scattered flyers from the upper floors with slogans like "Unite the Nation, Strive for Unified Peace" and "Resolutely Demand the Government to Suppress Internal Strife." The marching crowd then gathered over a hundred workers with wooden sticks and bamboo poles and went to places like the YMCA, dragging out four students, including Yu Zhenhua and Zhang Yong, beating and humiliating them. They stripped the four students of their clothes, painted the words "Special Agent" on their backs with black paint, tied the students' hands, and forced them into the marching column to Fuxing Park for a "public trial." Fortunately, the police learned of this and rescued the students.

### Statement by the Person in Charge of the Anti-Civil War Alliance of Students

The person in charge of the Shanghai Student Anti-Civil War Alliance solemnly declared his position: (1) The alliance absolutely supports the government's national policy and advocates condemning rebellion. (2) The alliance has never advocated strikes or sending representatives to Beijing to petition, because the alliance believes that striving for peace depends on the united unity of the national people to appeal to the Communist Party to stop the internal struggle with a stable attitude, and it cannot be achieved by rash or reckless actions. (3) The alliance especially hopes that citizens will collectively condemn unscrupulous elements who falsely represent public opinion, publish statements, undermine KMT-CPC unity, weaken the government's prestige, and alienate allied countries, in order to correct public opinion.

Message to Students from the Student Union

The Shanghai Student Union, in order to call for the protection of the glorious tradition of student movements, issued a message to students throughout the city yesterday, stating: "Thugs, under the guise of public opinion, have launched ugly acts of kidnapping, treating pure students as 'special agents' and 'traitors,' openly beating and humiliating them, and even tying them up and parading them through the streets. What is the intention of this? Why should good students be treated as 'sacrifices' for 'opposing the civil war'? Why is 'opposing internal strife' considered an improper act? Such unreasonable actions can only be done by morally depraved scum. Students throughout the city should regard this unfortunate incident as an insult to the glorious tradition of student movements, and we should immediately rise up to correct it and prevent it from happening again."

### Teachers and Staff Association Demands an End to Internal Strife

At 9:00 a.m. yesterday, the Municipal Primary School Teachers and Staff Association held a general assembly of representatives at Fuchun Elementary School. More than 200 representatives attended.

telegram to President Chiang, demanding an end to internal strife in order to lay the foundation for genuine peace in the country as soon as possible.

### Solving the Housing Difficulties of Citizens: Permission to Build Temporary Sheds; The Public Works Bureau Formulates Eight Measures Limiting Owner-Occupancy

Amidst the current housing shortage in this city, most citizens are unable to afford to rent houses with gold bars. Now that summer has arrived, many people live in small rooms in the city, which is not only unbearably hot but also detrimental to hygiene and affects people's health. According to reporter inquiries: In order to solve the suffering of the general public, the Municipal Public Works Bureau has formulated temporary measures for the construction of temporary sheds:

Temporary License

(1) These measures are specifically formulated for the purpose of adjusting citizens' housing, reducing the burden on citizens, and constructing temporary sheds in the urban area. (2) Those who need to build temporary sheds may apply to this bureau for a temporary license in accordance with these measures and construct temporary sheds outside the restricted construction areas after drawing a plan. (3) Within the former International Settlement and the former French Concession, and along asphalt roads (or important highways) within ten meters, and other areas that hinder fire prevention, hygiene, or urban appearance, temporary sheds shall not be built without approval.

Building Area

(4) For the construction of bamboo fence earthen wall bungalows, a vacant land of 2.5 meters or more must be left around the perimeter. The building area shall not exceed 70 square meters, the eaves shall not be higher than 2.5 meters above the ground, the roof frame must be constructed with solid wood or bamboo materials, and the roof must be covered with tiles or other fire-resistant materials. For the construction of mat sheds, a vacant land of 5 meters or more must be left around the perimeter. The building area shall not exceed 45 square meters.

### Grain Loan Bribery Suspect Case: The District Prosecutor's Office Will Continue to Interrogate Today

In the grain loan bribery suspect case, District Prosecutor Wu Qihua will continue to open court for a second interrogation at the Seventh Investigation Office at 9:00 a.m. today in order to actively and strictly investigate the true evidence of the defendants and witnesses. Those summoned include grain officials Yang Xizhi and Wang Daren, as well as related grain loan merchants: (1) Xie Changtai Zhu Shilong, (2) Xin Chang Zhu Yongming, (3) Xie Daheng Feng Yongsheng, (4) Qian Changyu Yu Liangji, (5) Heng Taifeng Zhang Chao, (6) Tongyi Company Lu Linxun, (7) Tong Chengchuan Changyu, (8) Santai Company, (9) Huifeng Company, (10) Changjiang Company. At the same time, Wan Molin, the owner of Wanchang Rice Shop, and Xing Zhigang, the manager of Chengfeng Rice Shop, who had previously paid a cash guarantee of 10 million yuan, were also summoned, for a total of fourteen people.

Moreover, although it was previously reported that the council would have two "no" expressions on this matter, the reporter made a special trip to visit Mr. Xu Jiji, a member of the Municipal Provisional Council, to inquire about the council's attitude towards this case. He said that since the exposure of the grain bribery case, the council had once convened a temporary meeting requesting the authorities to take strict action on this case. However, the official council will be formally established at the beginning of July, and this council is temporary in nature and will be abolished soon. Due to the imminent end of its term and the urgency of the matter, it does not intend to make any further proposals.

The eaves shall not be higher than 2.5 meters above the ground, and the roof frame must be constructed with solid Mao bamboo.

No Selling Allowed

(5) Any private construction of temporary sheds that does not comply with the provisions of these measures will be ordered to be demolished and severely punished according to law once discovered. (6) Temporary sheds that have been approved for construction must be occupied by the owner himself and must not be privately transferred, sold, or used for business purposes. Otherwise, they will be immediately ordered to be demolished once verified. (7) The residential period for temporary sheds is one year, and they must be completely demolished upon expiration. However, if the construction is good and relatively safe, an application for a one-year extension may be submitted before the expiration date, but only once. (8) These measures shall be implemented from the date of approval and promulgation.

### Relief for Northern Jiangsu Refugees: Fundraising Association to be Established Today

The situation in Northern Jiangsu is unstable, and refugees are fleeing to various places, distributed in Tongzhou, Yangzhou, Xuzhou, Hai'an, Zhenjiang, and other places. According to investigations, the number is over one million. They lack food and clothing and cannot return home. The tragic situation of their displacement is heartbreaking. Wu Zhihui, Niu Tiesheng, Leng Yuqiu, elders of Jiangsu Province, and Du Yuesheng, Chen Guangfu, Rong Desheng, local gentry of this city, were deeply concerned and responded to the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association, initiating the organization of fundraising relief. Preparations are now complete. Yesterday, Mr. Wu Zhihui, Mr. Du Yuesheng, and others jointly signed a letter inviting local celebrities from all walks of life in Shanghai and people from Northern Jiangsu living in Shanghai to organize the Shanghai Fundraising Committee of the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association. The inaugural meeting will be held at 3:00 p.m. today in the social hall of the Pudong Building on East Zhongzheng Road. According to the person in charge of the preparatory office of the association, a general notice was sent, but there may be omissions. It is hoped that people from all walks of life in Northern Jiangsu will actively participate and jointly discuss progress. It is heard that Minister Gu of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Chairman Wang of the Jiangsu Provincial Government will both personally attend to provide guidance.

### Gold Robbery

[This Newspaper] At about 9:00 a.m. yesterday, Laofengxiang Yongji Silver Shop at No. 414 Jinling Road sent an apprentice, Su Henghua, carrying 22 taels, 4 mace, and 5 fen of gold to Chen Zibiao's gold workshop on the third floor of No. 112, Lane 114, Puan Road to be melted. However, as soon as he arrived at the back door of the number, a robber lying in wait produced a pistol and robbed all the gold before fleeing.

### Landlords Force Tenants to Move Out, Leading to Many Rental Disputes

Recently, housing rental disputes have not subsided. It is reported that the main cause of the disputes is landlords forcing tenants to move out. The Wartime Housing Rental Law has been abolished, and according to the articles contained in the Civil Code: (1) If the tenant fails to pay rent for more than three months, (2) If the house must be renovated or repaired, or the owner wants to take it back for personal use, (3) If the tenant violates the lease agreement. Landlords can demand eviction if any of the above situations exist. However, the current housing shortage is severe. Although the landlord's request is legally based, the tenant has nowhere to move. As a result, lawsuits are becoming more and more common.

### Reward of One Million for the Gold Brick Case: A Waiter at the Xiyuan Cafe Receives It; Chen Yuansheng's Ex-Wife Does Not Forget Old Feelings, Visits with Her Son, Says "Take Care"

[This Newspaper] After the main culprit in the Central Bank's massive theft case, Chen Yuansheng, was arrested, he underwent a preliminary hearing once yesterday morning. His confession was very satisfactory, and after a slight interrogation, he was re-detained. The rumor that he would be transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office this morning is not true, because it will take some time to obtain a confession, investigate the case, and investigate the situation. It is learned that the female singer named Bo Luoli, who first reported the crime and accompanied the police officers to Hangzhou, was the first to report the crime. However, after arriving in Hangzhou, Chen had already left and could not be located. Therefore, the breakthrough in this case was actually due to the report from Chen Miaogen, a waiter at the Xiyuan Cafe in Hangzhou. It was based on this clue that the situation after his departure from Hangzhou was obtained. According to Section Chief Zhou, the reward of one million yuan offered by the Central Bank will be given to Chen Miaogen. Chen Yuansheng's ex-wife, Ms. Ye Yuzhen, who had divorced Chen about three years ago, came to visit him yesterday morning with her son. She had a few words with him and then said "Take Care" before saying goodbye.

### How to Obtain Tens of Millions of Mansions to Shelter All the Poor Scholars of the World and Make Them Happy

If we consider Shanghai as a stage, the "housing shortage" is a short play currently being performed. The "temporary shacks" mentioned here can be regarded as a small episode within that short play.

Recently, on vacant lots in Zhabei, Nanshi, Yangshupu, and Xujiahui, numerous small wooden houses and thatched huts have sprung up side by side. The residents of these shacks mostly claim to be refugees from northern Jiangsu who have fled to Shanghai. Without obtaining the consent of the landowners or the permission of the Public Works Bureau's construction department, they hastily erected shacks overnight or within a day. Initially, a few people started, and then, like a gust of wind, a crowd followed suit. Now, almost all vacant lots in the city can be found with shacks of varying sizes. Particularly noticeable are those along the Ferguson Road and Avenue Joffre intersection, all the way to the electric tram stop. This area is supposed to be a "super" residential area, surrounded by beautiful Western-style houses. Especially on the left is a huge, six-story, ship-shaped building. In contrast, it creates a very strong contrast, making people feel very unharmonious.

Originally, the land was vacant, and now that these self-proclaimed "refugees from northern Jiangsu" have come to build temporary shelters, it seems understandable. However, the situation is not that simple because it involves many other issues. First, the property rights of the landowners, this most "primitive" of human rights in law, have been clearly violated. Secondly, the construction of these shacks is invariably crude and makeshift. The materials used are nothing more than flammable reed mats, wooden planks, and bamboo blinds, densely packed together. The residents are also relatively mixed, causing concerns about fire and hygiene. The most dissatisfying thing is that there are hidden secrets within. It is said that many people with "special lower-class labor" status are also using the name of refugees to "invest" approximately 500,000 to 800,000 in the construction of these shacks. After completion, they charge over 1.2 million in transfer fees to others, making a huge profit in a single transaction. Shanghai is truly a complex city, where all kinds of bizarre things are happening.

Originally, the Public Works Bureau had already formulated a "Temporary Shack Construction Provisional Measures" in November of last year. Most of the shacks that have been built do not comply with these regulations. The Public Works Bureau has long considered demolishing those that have not been permitted, and the police have also received many complaints from landowners. Therefore, the two sides are currently discussing enforcement in the near future.

A reporter recently made a special trip to Ferguson Road to conduct a field observation. There are more than 20 shacks in this area, varying in height and size. The roofs are made of red tiles, gray tiles, reed mats, or thatched roofs. The walls are of two types: wooden planks or bamboo strips and mud. Inside, most are dirt floors, dark and damp, with dilapidated furniture, clearly the homes of poor people. Near the road, a fruit store has already opened. Several more orderly tiled wooden houses are locked, it's unknown if they're waiting for the right price to be assessed?

During the photography, from those   inside came a lot of people, who followed closely behind. They were worried about the demolition of their houses and looked at the reporter with pleading eyes, saying:

"Sir, please say some good words for us! We are refugees from northern Jiangsu, we have no other choice!"

Du Fu's poem says: "How to obtain tens of millions of mansions to shelter all the poor scholars of the world and make them happy." The poet's fervent emotion, even after thousands of years, can still arouse infinite resonance and sighing from those with a heart. However, besides objectively writing out the facts, what else can the reporter say? (Flying Goose)

Tall Buildings and Grass Shack: A Stark Contrast

### Cases of Illegal Military Tribunal Judgments: Can the Court Re-try Them? The District Attorney's Office Specifically Cables Higher Authorities for Instructions

The Shanghai District Court Procuratorate has been receiving requests from convicts sentenced by the former Shanghai Security Command and whose sentences have not been completed, asking the Procuratorate to review their cases and conduct new investigations. All the prosecutors unanimously believe that whether these convicts can be re-investigated is a legal issue. Therefore, they cabled the higher authorities for instructions. The original text is as follows: "After the restoration, the supplementary regulations for handling criminal proceedings stipulate that cases in recovered areas that were judged or disposed of by courts or prosecutors of illegal organizations during the period of occupation, whose execution is incomplete, shall be re-investigated by the prosecutors of the court to which they are attached. However, for judgments made by illegal military judicial organs, in accordance with the current Special Criminal Procedure Regulations, cases that should be tried by ordinary courts, whose execution is incomplete, are not stipulated as to whether they should be re-investigated. Please clarify this point. Second, during the occupation of Shanghai, drug cases were all judged by the illegal Shanghai Security Command military tribunals. Now, drug offenders who are serving their sentences are requesting re-investigations. How should this office handle them? Should the post-war measures for eradicating opium and eliminating its consequences in the recovered areas be applied? Please clarify this point. As this involves legal ambiguities, we are jointly cabling you to request instructions."

Subsequently, shareholders proposed that inspectors be selected to examine the points raised by the shareholders in accordance with the law, and there were requests to participate in the audit. At that time, some shareholders had already left the meeting, which led to the issue of insufficient legal quorum of shareholders present. The shareholders present then proposed to adjourn the meeting.

### Method for Issuing Graduation Certificates to Students of the Temporary University Preparatory Class; The Ministry of Education Formulates and Promulgates Principles in Accordance with the Instructions of the Chairman

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] At the National Education Restoration Conference held last year, in order to assist students of colleges and above in the recovered areas with their studies, selection principles were set, and the Ministry of Education approved the establishment of temporary university preparatory classes in various regions to enroll these students, providing them with preparatory courses. Subsequently, due to transportation difficulties in various places, the students were transferred to schools in the interior, and were unable to return to their original schools within a short period of time. These students were unable to immediately transfer to regular universities for studies. In consideration of the students' studies and in response to actual needs, the Ministry of Education specially ordered the various preparatory classes to add basic courses in accordance with the university curriculum, and formulated measures for handling the studies of students who had studied at colleges and above in the recovered areas, and measures for the final examination and distribution of students who had not completed their studies at the various temporary university preparatory classes. For students in the highest grade who passed the final examination after completing the preparatory courses, the Ministry of Education issued temporary university graduation certificates. However, some graduating students still wanted to study at regular colleges and universities in order to obtain regular school graduation certificates. These students had already completed their studies in the preparatory classes. If they re-enrolled, the capacity of the schools would be limited, preventing universal enrollment. Moreover, repeated learning would increase their financial burden and waste their time. In order to alleviate this factual difficulty, the Ministry of Education has repeatedly considered and researched ways to reduce the difficulties for schools and students. It is reported that the Ministry recently formulated methods for issuing graduation certificates to graduating students of the various temporary university preparatory classes in accordance with the principles instructed by the Chairman and ordered their implementation. The details of the methods are as follows: (1) The graduation qualifications of graduating students of the various temporary university preparatory classes shall be approved by the Ministry, and the Ministry shall issue temporary university graduation certificates. (2) The schools shall issue graduation certificates to the graduating students of the various temporary university preparatory classes. (3) Graduating students of the various temporary university preparatory classes who volunteer to participate in the graduation examination of national colleges and universities may independently identify a school and, three months before the graduation examination held by the school in the 36th year, submit an academic record form, together with a temporary university graduation certificate and two 2.5-inch half-length photos of themselves, directly to the school for application. After review by the school, they shall be notified of the subjects they should participate in the examination. (4) The examination subjects in the preceding article shall be the same as the graduation examination subjects of the relevant departments of the school. (5) Students who pass the examination shall have their names listed by the school, graduation certificates shall be prepared, and submitted to the Ministry for approval and printing, and the temporary university graduation certificates shall be submitted to the Ministry for cancellation. (6) This examination method shall be limited to one time in the summer of the 36th year.

[Our Newspaper, Kunming, 21st] Teachers and staff from Kunming at public and private middle schools in Kunming went on strike for three days to demand the issuance of repatriation fees.

The North Sichuan Salt Affairs Department has already committed to raising 100 million yuan, and the nine counties of Santai, Suining, and Shehong have jointly committed to raising 70 million yuan. For the remaining 30 million yuan, they plan to find other ways to raise it. If the full amount is raised, the monthly interest can be as high as 12 million yuan, calculated at the lowest interest rate of 6% per month in Santai.

In addition, the elders and gentry of the area will jointly ask the provincial government to: (1) Approve the transfer of the property of the former Tongshu Joint Middle School (which was temporarily managed by the province after being changed to a provincial middle school, totaling more than 1,300 mu of land) to the North Sichuan Agricultural and Industrial College for use as a foundation; (2) Transfer the 600 mu of the Liujiaying Airport in Santai to the North Sichuan Agricultural and Industrial College for the opening of an experimental farm; (3) Request the provincial government to include the North Sichuan Agricultural and Industrial College in the provincial budget from the next semester.

### Hong Kong Expeditionary Force Suffers Another Defeat: China United Defeats Star East Team 2-3; Two Consecutive Goals in the Second Half Lead to Victory; Zhang Banglun Makes Countless Saves, Deserving Credit for the Victory

After the Hong Kong Star East football team suffered a defeat to Qingbai last week, they suffered their second defeat yesterday, losing to the China United team by a score of 2-3. Star East led 2-1 in the first half, but failed to score in the second half, while China United scored two consecutive goals within ten minutes, reversing the defeat into victory. The game was quite tense, but the performance seemed less exciting at first, gradually improving later. China United goalkeeper Zhang Banglun made countless saves yesterday, stopping several certain goals. He was truly the hero of China United's victory yesterday. The order at the stadium yesterday did not improve despite the increased ticket prices. More than ten thousand fans still broke through the fences and climbed over the walls from all sides. Although the non-constitutional police tried their best to maintain order, the gaps were like a flood, impossible to stop, resulting in chaos and deep regret. It is said that only over sixteen hundred people purchased tickets to enter yesterday.

Each With Their Own Strengths

The China United lineup was only decided a few minutes before the game yesterday. It seemed to be a difficult birth. Qingbai needs to fight Star East again on Wednesday, so in order to maintain strength, Li Yichen and Gao Baozheng were both resting. Wu Qixiang was initially intended to be on the bench, but ultimately appeared due to the importance of the defense. Xin Fuzhen was ill, so Meng Yiliang remained in the center. Han Longhai returned to his old role as right midfielder, but because he has been a forward for a long time, his position often fluctuated between forward and defender. China United's eleven players remained consistent throughout, and the arrangement was appropriate, with each player fulfilling their duty. Star East switched the positions of Guo Yingqi and Zhang Jinhai, and Xu Jincheng was changed to left defender. Fei Chunhua and Jia Youliang found it difficult to move as a result. In terms of strength, both sides had their own strengths, but the difference in victory or defeat was that China United's defense was solid, and Star East repeatedly failed to attack. Although they controlled the overall situation in the first half, they only won by one goal, and were unable to counterattack in the second half, also due to China United's impregnable defense.

Repeatedly Fails to Attack

Referee He Chunhui blew the whistle to start the game. China United had the wind at their backs, while Star East was against the wind. Feng Jingxiang attacked, but was intercepted by Meng Yiliang. Zhaorong passed to Shuoyou again, and Shuoyou shot from afar, testing the waters. The ball was fast and urgent, and Wu Qixiang rushed to save, blocking it into a corner kick, without any gain or loss. At nine minutes, Zhaorong made a comeback, and Shixin was on guard, but Star East still did not succeed. Not long after, "Iron Leg" spotted a gap in the left corner, and quickly passed to Li Yao, who crossed the enemy defense and knocked on the door. Zhu Zhaohang saved the shot, turning danger into safety. Afterwards, both sides fell into a melee. Although Star East controlled the ball, they could not find a way to score.

Star East Takes the Lead

Until the 23rd minute, Guo Yingqi launched an attack in the middle, passing to the forward. Zhaorong caught it perfectly, and kicked the ball into the net from the right corner. Banglun was unable to save it, and the goal was lost. Star East took the lead 1-0, breaking the record. The away team's momentum increased greatly. Deng Guangsen crossed from the baseline, and Zhaorong headed the ball, but Zhang Banglun took care of both sides, appearing very busy. China United counterattacked. Li Yao received assistance from Meng Yiliang, and advanced quickly on the left. Rongsheng met him, and the ball went into "Iron Leg's" feet, who dribbled it to the Star East goal, and lightly tapped it in. The ball went into the net, tying the score at 1-1. After that, the two sides engaged in close combat, and the conflict was fierce. Until one minute before the end of the first half, Fei Chunhua missed a certain goal, and the audience was lamenting. The Star East forward was already in front of the goal. Zhaorong went deep alone, and shot hard from the 25-yard mark, but it was saved again. Star East ended the first half with a score of 2-1.

Two Consecutive Goals

After halftime, both teams discussed their secrets. Hou Rongsheng of Star East left the field due to the recurrence of an old injury, and Luo Weiquan came on as a substitute. On China United's side, although there were seventeen listed players, six of them were spectators, so the lineup did not change. After the kickoff, China United's five forwards advanced together. "Left Foot King" looked ahead and behind, and Feng Shengsheng cooperated to resist, expending a lot of energy. At seven minutes, Li Yao took a corner kick. Xu Jincheng marked Sun Jinshun, and Luo Weiquan marked Xu. Unexpectedly, Han Longhai suddenly appeared. Liu Songsheng thought the enemy general was opening fire, and rushed over. The front of the Star East goal fell into chaos. Youliang saw clearly, and lightly kicked the ball into the net, tying the score again at 2-2. At this time, China United's momentum was high, and they suddenly came and went in the away team's penalty area. Just two minutes later, Longhai passed to Youliang from afar, who passed it to the right corner. Xiao Fei arrived in time, lifted his foot, and the ball went into the net, making the score 3-2, with China United coming from behind. Star East worked together to counterattack, but the positions of Longhai and Yongfu were exchanged, failing to stop it. Li Zhaorong was like a horse off the reins, attacking several times, but all were saved by Banglun. At 32 minutes, Li Yao left the field, and Feng Jingxiang fouled again. The ball crossed over the crossbar. When Li Yao left the field for the second time, the time was almost up. The melee did not last long, and when the whistle sounded, both sides withdrew their troops. China United defeated Star East 3-2 with strength.

### Anecdotes from Recreation Garden: A Few Wonderful Moments; People Jumped Over Walls Because They Couldn't Afford Tickets

Yesterday's game between Star East and China United was wonderful, but the audience's performance was even more spectacular. The audience rushed into the stadium like a charge, with thousands of horses galloping. Countless people climbed over the walls. They couldn't afford ten thousand yuan of tickets, but they had to watch the game. The result was, of course, "people jumped over walls in desperation." Only 1,600 tickets were sold yesterday, but there were 20,000 spectators, which is why.

The main reason for Star East's defeat yesterday was the immaturity of their goalkeeping technique. China United's victory should be attributed to goalkeeper Zhang Banglun. Little Zhang was the darling of yesterday's game. After the game, he wore his jersey, took a beauty (not an American) in a rickshaw, and paraded through the streets. A group of little boys followed behind, and some even shouted "Long live Zhang Banglun!" This shows how popular football heroes are.

Two little fans "fell from the sky," resulting in injuries. After the paramedics bandaged them, they sent them to the best seats to watch the game. The reporter asked them how their injuries were, and one of them replied, "As long as we can watch the game, this little injury doesn't matter."

Our compatriots are not only anxious to watch the game, but they are also "eager to return home." After the game, the audience scrambled to exit, resulting in chaos. Some rascals took the opportunity to "operate," groping young girls in the chaos. So all one could hear was the sound of "May you be killed a thousand times."

Yesterday, in addition to those who entered using the "flying eaves and walking walls" method, there were also those who rushed into the venue using the military so-called "breakthrough" method. Two locations 20 yards from the entrance were "broken through." Staff and police inside the venue held bamboo spears at the "breakers," barely holding their ground. (Shu Xun)

### Casual Notes on the Art World

— Wen Zhaotong

It has been almost ten years since I last saw Pang Xunqin. This time, I heard that he had flown back to Shanghai from Chongqing, which made me feel infinitely happy. Finally, we met.

Many people praise us Changshu people, saying that Changshu is a good place, with a developed culture, and that every dynasty produces great artists. For example, Huang Yifeng in the Yuan Dynasty, Wang Gengyan, Wu Mojing, and Jiang Nansha in the early Qing Dynasty, and Pang Xunqin, a modern Chinese painter, also holds a very important position.

In fact, when politics are stable and life is not a problem, Changshu, with its beautiful Lushan and beautiful Shangchao, coupled with the superiority of its cultural traditions, it is very possible to produce several excellent artists. However, since the War of Resistance Against Japan, the enemy has been rampant, the soldiers have been in chaos, the countryside has been plagued by famine and plunder, and after the victory, there are still turbulent phenomena everywhere. How can we talk about art?

As soon as Xunqin saw me, he first talked about this situation in his hometown, which made him feel deeply disappointed.

He went to Paris to study art very early, studying the emerging paintings of the 20th century. Whether in conception, coloring, or brushwork... he showed a fresh atmosphere. He has been back in China for more than fifteen years. Some time ago, he spent some effort to promote the new art movement. In the past ten years, for the sake of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he has been running around, and has only been able to gain a little in the study of brush painting and decorative art of past dynasties. Originally, he should have gone to Dunhuang, the treasure house of ancient Buddhist art, to do research work, but he has not yet realized it. Not to mention research, he has recently been trying to find a more settled residence in Shanghai, but he has not been able to.

The Storm Society has a historical position in the Chinese Western painting movement. It was founded in the autumn of 1932, initiated by Xunqin. Ni Yide, Zhou Duo, Duan Pingyou, Yang Taiyang, Yang Qiuren, Zhang Xuan... all participated, all of whom were excellent painters at the time. They demanded the acquisition of new techniques and despised the vulgar and mediocre academic art. Looking at the course of the emerging art movement in China, this is a group with very valuable, although, at the time, they only yearned for the so-called forms of 20th-century painting, such as the violent Fauvism, the deformed Cubism, the nihilistic Dadaism, the bizarre Surrealism... Whether these can express China's new art is still a question, but, in the process of creating China's new art, it is indispensable.

When the Storm Society was founded, it had such a declaration:

"The air around us is too silent, and mediocrity and vulgarity surround us. Countless stupid movements of incompetent people, countless shallow shouts of shallow people.

"We abhor all old forms, old colors, and abhor all mediocre and low-level techniques. We want to use new techniques to express the spirit of the new era.

"Let us rise up! Use the passion of a hurricane, the iron-like rationality, to create our world of interlaced colors, lines, and shapes!"

In many of these words, we only feel a kind of revolutionary enthusiasm, and this enthusiasm is the yeast for creating Shen Guo's new art, which is undeniable.

What about Xunqin's paintings recently? I am very concerned about this issue.

Recently, a small frame of his "Line Drawing Figures" was purchased by a collector in London for one hundred and twenty-five pounds. This is his personal success, but it is also a clear proof of the increased international status of the Chinese art world.

What are his paintings like? I have already seen two figure paintings in the Shanghai Fine Arts Writers Association exhibition some time ago. He said that these were unintentional works. However, we feel that Xunqin has been working on the lines in traditional Chinese brush painting for the past ten years, making the lines themselves simple, exquisite, and beautiful. Then, he uses these lines to complete the realism that has always been neglected in Chinese painting. It can also be said that he expresses reality from the ancient, simple and elegant, and despises the freehand brushwork in literati ink play. It can be said that this is a beneficial construction for the future of Chinese painting development.

Unfortunately, I have not had the opportunity to see all of his carefully crafted masterpieces. Moreover, Xunqin is a cautious writer. He believes that the relatively satisfactory results in recent years are too few.

### Only Warmth

— Junping

I haven't been to Suzhou in ten years. Although I've wanted to take some time to play there recently, it's so close, yet so far. In the end, I haven't made it. I can't help but feel a little melancholy about this. Because Suzhou is not very strange to me. In addition to the scenic spots such as Tiger Hill, Mudu, and Lingyan, there is also a fascinating story that makes it hard for me to sleep. This story is not a romance, not a scarlet fantasy, but only a little warmth in the world that allows a wanderer to experience the preciousness of human feelings for the first time.

In the summer of ten years ago, I was hired as a teacher at Caoqiao Middle School on Gongyuan Road in Suzhou. I also regularly wrote for several newspapers in Shanghai. Although the total income was only eighty or ninety yuan, prices were very low at that time. Eighty or ninety yuan could buy at least ten dan of white rice. Moreover, everything in Suzhou was cheaper than in Shanghai, except for daily necessities. At that time, I only had to send one-third of my total income to my family in Zhejiang, and I could spend the remaining two-thirds as I pleased. Fifty or sixty yuan was enough to maintain a person's life. Although it wasn't rich, I didn't feel very embarrassed. After a long time, I became very familiar with my colleagues. Everyone asked me why I didn't bring my wife from Zhejiang? I said that I also wanted to bring her over. People who are used to family life are not very comfortable with living the life of a wanderer again. Moreover, the dormitory at the school was too small. In order to cultivate a good writing mood, I had to rent a house separately.

My colleague, Mr. Shi, led me to see several houses, but I wasn't very satisfied. In the end, I chose a house on Xiatang Road, Qimen Road, owned by someone named Xie. The house was along the river, with more than a dozen rooms up and down, and there was also a living room and a courtyard. At that time, it was stated that the left and right廂rooms and the living room on the upper floor would be rented to me, and the living room would be shared by everyone. The rent was only fifteen yuan per month. I paid such a low price and could live in three large rooms. I naturally felt very gratified. I didn't need to live in so many rooms by myself, but since I was preparing to bring my family to Suzhou, although these rooms were still a bit too much, it wouldn't hurt to let myself and my wife live more comfortably.

The landlord, Mr. Xie, was an old man of about sixty years old. It wouldn't be very appropriate to say old, because he looked like he was only about fifty years old. He had a wife, a concubine, and a daughter of about twenty years old. In addition, he also hired an old nanny and led a maid named Juanxiang. After I came into contact with these people in life, I immediately discovered that they were all very kind people, except for the landlord's concubine, because she was a very incompetent and also had a neurotic woman. In Shanghai language, she was a woman with some "thirteen o'clock" atmosphere. She went to the story-telling house every day, rain or shine, and talked about "Madam White Snake" or "Xue Rengui," pointing to the sky and drawing the earth. I immediately realized that their family was very normal, except that the neurotic woman mixed in seemed a bit abnormal.

Later, I became more familiar with them. I could actually participate in their conversations in the courtyard without any scruples. Although they asked the servants to send tea and water every day, wash clothes, and serve me with all their efforts, Mrs. Xie still cared about me and often asked me when my wife from Zhejiang could be brought over. Miss Xie often asked me to show her the articles pasted on the newspaper because I could write some articles, because she was a young girl with some literary atmosphere and was more sympathetic and respectful to literati. I had not received the warmth of a family since I was a child, and now I was actually enjoying the rare warmth in someone else's family. My mood at the time was indescribable.

Later, I finally brought my wife from Zhejiang. At that time, my wife was already seven months pregnant. I originally planned to bring her over after giving birth, but there was no better obstetrics and gynecology hospital in the countryside. As a result, I accompanied her to Suzhou. When my wife arrived in Suzhou, the Xie family was very happy. They specially bought a lot of vegetables for her, which Mrs. Xie cooked herself. That night, I drank too much wine and staggered up the stairs. I heard them still talking loudly around my wife.

Soon my wife was about to give birth. The hospital was at Tianci Village Boxi Hospital. At that time, I was in class at school. My wife was accompanied to the hospital by Mrs. Xie and her daughter. That year, the weather was particularly hot, and the thermometer was almost always around 100 degrees every day. The two of them accompanied my wife in a rickshaw to the hospital in the scorching sun. The child died soon after giving birth. Because it was my wife's first time giving birth, she was very sad about the dead child. Later, my wife told me that although they superficially advised my wife not to be too sad, they hid outside the room and secretly sobbed for the dead child!

Later, I finally left Suzhou with my wife. I only indirectly knew that Mr. Xie passed away not long after due to a stroke. Miss Xie from the Xie family also got married. The world is changing, and everything has changed, right? Although I am wandering outside, I am always thinking of them, because they are kind people that I rarely see in my life, and I have rarely experienced the only warmth in the world.

### Whispers

— Shangguan Shen

On a peaceful and sunny afternoon, I walked out of the door alone. I met him and led him to the park. We wandered on the soft lawn. He snuggled close to me, showing intimacy, while I, lost in thought, stared at the distant blue sky. I forgot him. As I walked out of the park gate and stepped onto the street, I glanced and saw him still silently following me. I stepped into a cafe, smoking cigarettes, one after another. Light smoke swirled before my eyes, misty and dreamlike, rich stimulation, stinging my nerves. I absentmindedly moved down money and left. The glass door closed gently behind me. I met him again, "Come with me," I smiled bitterly. He snuggled against me again. He followed me, closely following me.

He is my own shadow...

### Talking About Education

I know nothing about education, but recently I have had some thoughts.

A friend's son was admitted to a certain junior high school this semester. At the beginning of the school year, it was difficult to pay off tuition, miscellaneous fees, hygiene fees, labor fees, lecture fees, and other various fees. Unexpectedly, not long after the start of the school year, the school sent a notice stating that students must wear Boy Scout uniforms to school every day according to the order of the Department of Education, otherwise they would not be allowed to attend school! The lion had no choice but to reluctantly order his son to drop out of school.

Causing young people to drop out of school halfway for a set of uniforms! I have seen it in the newspaper for a long time. We strongly support every student wearing the prescribed uniform, because it is not only neat and beautiful, but also avoids extravagance and frivolity. We also strongly support the Boy Scout education prescribed by the government. Boy Scout education is to make young people exercise their bodies and develop a spirit of labor service for people and the country. However, in this time of expensive things and widespread hunger, we cannot but take everything into consideration and weigh the pros and cons. We want to rescue education, we want to rescue illiteracy, so that kind of "order" may as well leave a little room for flexibility.

The greatest purpose of education is to make people knowledgeable and sensible. Speaking of physical exercise, speaking of labor service, it is not just about some clothing and forms! (Zhongyuan)

### A Love Story: Two Birds, One Nest (6)(3)

— Zhao Qingge

Gradually, the late spring chill passed, the weather warmed, and with Mr. Liao's relentless medical treatment, Xiaohong's foot improved day by day. However, as the doctor had said, the healing was very slow, tormenting Xiaohong until she was skin and bones. During Xiaohong's illness, Bao Ling took over all her duties entirely and constantly visited Xiaohong quietly. According to Bao Ling, it would be better to hire a foreign surgeon for treatment, but Mr. Liao absolutely refused. He stubbornly opposed foreign doctors and foreign medicine, even to the point of an irreconcilable "opposition"!

And so, Xiaohong tossed and turned on her sickbed day and night. She was grateful to Mr. Liao, but she also resented him! Though she had only lived for fifteen years, she was already tired of living! Especially whenever she heard the mistress scolding indirectly, she felt that living was truly superfluous! She feared facing the future days. She thought that only death was the only way to relieve the pain, yet she couldn't die! The night seemed longer for her, and she deeply felt that she would never see the dawn, that she would be forever trapped in the darkness. Besides Mr. Liao, she was also grateful to Bao Ling, and she pitied Bao Ling! She felt sorry for Bao Ling because she knew that Bao Ling was suffering just as she was, enduring the same torment! In this world, only the unfortunate sympathize with the unfortunate; so Bao Ling sympathized with her; she sympathized with Bao Ling! However, why didn't Liao Dong sympathize with her? Wasn't Liao Dong equally unfortunate? She couldn't understand! Therefore, she was grateful to Mr. Liao and grateful to Bao Ling. In addition to hating the mistress, her feelings for Liao Dong gradually faded, to the point of trying to forget him! She also missed her parents and resented them! Ever since she married into the family, it seemed as if her parents had abandoned her. Though they were so close, she couldn't go home to see them, nor did they come to see her. She often muttered to herself, "It's true: 'A married daughter is like water thrown away.' My parents are so heartless to not want me anymore!" It was true; she had been severed from her parents by the tailor's steward as if cutting clothes, cutting the ties of father-daughter love with a single snip! But was this truly what the tailor's steward willingly did? Who asked them to have daughters they couldn't support? So, while Xiaohong resented her parents, she still forgave them and missed them!

Amidst a jumble of complex and contradictory emotions, Xiaohong could only confusedly endure the passing of time, keeping her eyes tightly shut all day long, letting fate be the judge! What else could she do? Her surroundings were so dark. She couldn't find a lamp, so she couldn't see a shore where she could find redemption!

### Rice Market Remained Unchanged Last Week; Black Market for Public Bonds Declared Over; Gold, Banknotes, and Hong Kong Dollars All Strong; Sugar and Rayon Soared

The price of rice in this city, after the authorities intensified adjustments, although it has not yet completely stabilized, the overall trend has stabilized. If efforts can be continued, both the symptoms and root cause can be addressed, it may not be difficult to overcome the lean season. However, just as one wave subsides, another rises. As soon as the rice market achieved tranquility, the stock market suddenly stirred up trouble. Due to the official decision to repay the principal and interest of public bonds at face value, the high price that the black market for public bonds had been wildly speculating for days plummeted. It dropped to as low as 300 yuan. Numerous Chinese and foreign brokerage firms collapsed one after another, and the Chinese and foreign stock markets were also adversely affected. A decision to temporarily suspend trading was reached on Saturday. Other commodities were mostly stable, except that sugar and rayon increased somewhat more significantly. The weekly developments are summarized as follows.

Hemp: The opening price at the beginning of the week was 1,875,000 yuan, once retreating to 1,870,000 yuan, which was the lowest price of the week. It was stable on Tuesday. Afterwards, with the loosening of the money supply, buying interest gradually increased. By Friday, it repeatedly approached the 2,000,000 yuan mark. Although it slightly declined afterwards, it closed at 1,995,000 yuan, which was the highest price of the week. The closing price on Saturday was 1,930,000 yuan, an increase of 25,000 yuan compared to the end of last week.

Foreign Currencies: The opening price of US dollars at the beginning of the week was 2,550 yuan, once retreating to 2,520 yuan, which was the lowest price of the week. It hovered around 2,600 yuan on Tuesday and Wednesday. On Friday, with demand exceeding supply, it rose to 2,700 yuan. In the afternoon, it further increased to 2,720 yuan, which was the highest price of the week. The closing price at the end of the week was 2,660 yuan. The lowest price for Hong Kong dollars was 460 yuan on Monday and Tuesday. On Friday, exchange dealers covered their short positions, raising the price to 515 yuan, with the highest price on Saturday at 530 yuan.

Public Bonds: The opening price of the Unification C bonds at the beginning of the week was 3,050 yuan. Due to rumors that the Ministry of Finance would begin repaying the principal and interest in July, it retreated to 2,450 yuan. The selling pressure remained strong on Tuesday, and many securities firms were stranded. On Wednesday, short covering was frequent, and it rose again to 3,150 yuan. On Friday, with the authorities clearly announcing that repayment would be made at face value, morale was depressed and the price plummeted to 950 yuan. On Saturday, the lowest price reached 300 yuan. Although some short-covering transactions were made, reaching 700 to 800 yuan, the market had already collapsed. As a result, the industry decided to temporarily suspend trading.

Chinese Stocks: At the beginning of the week, affected by the sharp fall in Unification bonds, morale was weak, and short sellers took the opportunity to become active. All stocks were at low prices. The "Three Small" stocks showed a slight glimmer of hope, but the good times did not last long. On Friday, they were squeezed down by another 10%. On Saturday, further affected by the plunge in the bond market, quoted prices were chaotic, and there were no formal transactions.

Foreign Stocks: At the beginning of the week, all value stocks also declined, and buying interest surged, uniformly squeezing the shorts. On Wednesday, there was a slight rebound. After Friday, due to the decline in both value and growth stocks, morale collapsed, and there was a sharp decline across the board.

Rice and Grains: The rice market remained stable throughout last week under the control of the authorities, but the underlying situation still contained manipulation. Without thorough measures, it would be difficult to achieve smooth operation. The flour market was flat and weak at the beginning of the week. After Thursday, it suddenly rebounded, and trading was also suspended. Coarse grains also showed little fluctuation initially, with a predominantly weak trend. They only began to show strength after Friday.

Sugar: At the beginning of the week, with the support of out-of-town merchants and local traders, the market price rose. Later, due to rumors that the Taiwan Sugar Corporation would sell at any time, morale weakened, but this did not materialize. Morale turned firm, and prices rose sharply again. On Thursday, the Taiwan Sugar Corporation raised its selling price, and the market trend rose again. Friday and Saturday saw repeated peaks, which was also a recent matter of great interest.

Cash Yarn: In the past week, coarse yarn was strong while fine yarn was flat. Guangdong merchants were very active in purchasing branded yarns such as 20-count Special Double Horse, Special Golden Chicken, Special Dafa, and Red Man Clock. Tianjin merchants were also actively purchasing 20-count Water Moon, Fengnian, Standing Horse, and Sunlight yarns. The market trend was extremely strong. The highest price of the entire week was 2,060,000 yuan for 42-count Blue Phoenix on Saturday, and the lowest was 900,000 yuan for 10-count Weaver Girl on Monday. In terms of count, the largest increases compared to the previous week were 80,000 to 140,000 yuan for 20-count Special Double Horse, Special Golden Chicken, Special Dafa, and Red Man, followed by 90,000 yuan for 32-count Blue Phoenix, 50,000 yuan for 16-count Guangming, 50,000 yuan for 10-count Weaver Girl, and 10,000 yuan for 42-count Achievement. The Textile Building Company opened bidding for 26 types of yarn on Wednesday, 28 types on Thursday, and 27 types on Friday, totaling 81 types.

Fabric Market: The situation within the week was extremely ordinary. The market inventory was ample, and there was little special demand from out-of-town merchants and door-to-door vendors. Only Peach Blossom, Lady Lin, and Damingfu silk had slightly more sales than the previous week, with increases of 2,000 yuan each. The remaining brands were mostly similar, but 16-pound coarse cloth such as Huadie actually fell by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan.

Printed Cloth: The Textile Building Company had not made any purchases for the past three weeks. Other private yarn factories, because they made a good profit by buying cotton to spin yarn, Da Sheng, Da Cheng, Min Feng, Qing Yu, Su Lun, and Xin Yu factories all made purchases, with prices increasing by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan compared to the previous week. In addition, both New York and American cotton futures and spot prices rose by more than 20 pounds.

Rayon: The market was flat and unchanged on Monday and Tuesday of last week. On Wednesday, it became strong again. On Thursday, the silver money industry was closed for holiday, and there was no market. On Friday, due to the increased asking prices from Chinese merchants and the lack of 20-count bright rayon, coupled with active buying by bullish traders, a situation of rampant price increases was created. On Saturday, there was no shortage of profit-taking sales, so prices fell slightly.

Factory By-products: The market was firm and stable. Foreign firms had little inventory. Actual sales to end-users were minimal. Transactions between fellow traders were still lively. At the beginning of the week, 78-point high-grade material was priced at 2,330,000 yuan. New orders for 76-77 point material were priced at 2,200,000 to 2,250,000 yuan. Within the week, mid-grade five-dan material was priced at 2,100,000 to 2,150,000 yuan, while other dan material was priced at 2,000,000 to 2,050,000 yuan. Ordinary other dan material was priced at 1,900,000 to 2,000,000 yuan. Five-dan dried material was priced at 1,550,000 to 1,650,000 yuan. All grades increased by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan.

Silk Goods: Meiya quilt covers were rarely traded within the week, with quoted prices generally ranging from 1,500,000 to 1,520,000 or 1,530,000 yuan. Although there were many transactions in Da Cheng Ge Shichou silk, selling prices gradually declined. On Monday, it was 5,570 yuan. On Tuesday, there was a slight increase, rising by 100 yuan. On Saturday, it weakened again, finally trading at 5,220 yuan. Hangzhou goods such as various spinning silks saw high increases. Sheng Huo electric spinning silk was actively purchased by out-of-town merchants, and prices rose sharply.

### Strict Ban on Private Deposit-Taking by Commercial Firms

Regarding silver money firms and banks that engage in deposit-taking, lending, remittance, and discounting, the authorities have previously stipulated that they must comply with regulations and register before being permitted to operate. Ordinary companies and commercial firms are not allowed to privately engage in this business. Recently, the municipal government has received reports that a considerable number of companies and firms are still privately accepting deposits at high interest rates and establishing deposit or savings departments without authorization, in clear violation of the ban. In order to protect the safety of depositors and maintain the normal operation of banks, the municipal government has reiterated the ban and is strictly prohibiting such activities.

### New Crop of White Mustard Seeds Arrives

White mustard seeds had created high prices during the lean months of last month under the purchase of Guangdong merchants, but because of the new bountiful harvest, it has arrived from the place of production in large numbers! But the Guangdong merchants's need to buy has been satisfied early, and the intention to wait and see, and the local sales also were dull, it plummeted, falling one full fold from its peak, and it is feared that the situation cannot be stabilized.

### Timber Market Looks Optimistic

The timber market, due to the strength of the gold market and improved confidence, has shifted from a weak trend to a firm one. Currently, all grades of goods are firm and stable, and fir has rebounded.

### U.S. Paper Production Capacity

### U.S. to Increase Silver Price to 90.3 Cents Per Ounce

[United Press, Washington, 22nd] The Senate today passed a bill stipulating that the Treasury Department may sell surplus silver for domestic use at a price of 90.3 cents per ounce, compared to the current price of 71.1 cents per ounce. Two years later, the price could rise to $1.29, or the actual monetary value of silver.

[United Press, New York, 22nd] Silver sources said that if China receives a large new loan from the United States, it may adopt the issuance of coins to stabilize the Chinese currency system. It is said that the appearance of coins could eliminate China's inflationary tendencies.

### Mexican Bank Sells Gold Bars

[United Press, Mexico City, 22nd] The Bank of Mexico has recently sold gold bars and can export them abroad, with the price at 5,750 paper pesos per kilogram (Mexican designation), equivalent to approximately USD 36.92 per ounce. With the U.S. gold price at USD 35, the gold bar price is slightly lower than the previous price of 4.75 paper pesos per gold peso set ten days ago, in order to reduce the profits from the private smuggling of gold out of Mexico.

### Surplus Grain Used as Fuel in Argentina

[Reuters, Buenos Aires, 22nd] Argentine President Perón said that Argentina could have exported more grain, but due to a shortage of fuel and a severe shortage of tires, transportation is inconvenient, so grain has to be burned as fuel. The current harvest is expected to decrease by approximately 25 percent.

### Ge Jingzhong Discusses:

### Sericulture: One Load of Silk Requires a Loss of One Million; Cocoon Production Sufficient for Only Half a Year; Eastern Silkworm Cocoons of Good Quality and High Price

Ge Jingzhong, General Manager of the China Sericulture Company, told a Central News Agency reporter at his residence that this year's silkworm eggs are divided into two categories: domestically improved and Eastern varieties. The Eastern varieties are those imported by China Sericulture from Japan this year, and are the latest invention of Japan. The cocoon quality is excellent. While the price of average silkworm is sold for less than 100,000 yuan, the eastern ones can be sold for 150,000. If silkworm farmers only breed and nurture ordinary types, they will definitely lose money. Nurturning the Eastern type can cover costs, and also manufacturers are willing to pay high prices for them, because it can lower the costs of silk reeling, making it more cost effective than cheaper ones. Those outside are unaware of the reality and think that somebody is oppressing the farmers, or somebody is raising prices. All is not as it seems. This year the the China Sericulture Company is promoting the Eastern type by taking the latest and best types and producing in provinces such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Yunnan, domestic types can improve. He then added that this year's silk market is facing steeply increasing rice prices, which causes the cost of drying silk to increase, and the costs of one load of silk cocoons is approximately 500,000 or more. As the cost of four loads of cocoons to make silk is approximately 2,000,000 yuan, and the cost of reeling the silk is approximately 1.2 million, based on the current price of silk, not including the burden of interest, there is a loss of approximately one million. He added that the government is promoting raw silk exports and increased production. Therefore, the national bank and China Sericulture company are working together and are aware of the losses, purely due to cost of living and the disparity in exchange ratios. In absolute support of the government, it has been decided to not let silk merchants walk on the road to destruction. Soon, there will be enlightening incentive policies so that both the silkworm farmers and silk merchants can tough out the hard times and the state can improve its exports. Regarding the ban of foreign silk imports to preserve the China Silk industry, Ge said that silk is important for the peasants and also the four provences of Jiang Zhe Chuan Yue, it is crucial for rural prosperity, it is not only about the exports. Ge thought that the solution to the crisis is that the silk production can produce 16 to 17 thousand loads in the Jiang Zhe province, but the cocoon price is too low, and some farmers only produce earth silk to await the better prices. Its quantity will be only 5 to 6 thousand loads, it is indeed a waste. Because the price of earth silk is lower than factory silk, Ge continued and said that the silk factories in Jiangzhe and Shanghai can manufacture 40 thousands loads of silk, but the cocoons can only last for 6 months. Therefore, they have asked the government to negotiate 70,000 loads of silk cocoons to Japan on loan. (Rumors of reparations are absolutely not true) If it can be done, the shortage of raw materials can be solved, and the exports of raw silk can gain 40-50 million USD.

### Southeast Asia Rice Surplus Problem: Two Different British Reports

[United Press, Singapore, 22nd] A British Air Force survey of harvests in Burma and Java found that the amount available for domestic needs was still short by more than 600,000 tons. However, the British Cabinet's Far East Commissioner, Sir Gilbert Rennie, announced that Burma would continue to export rice from its wartime reserves. Although there are no confirmed reports on the surplus rice in Java, the situation is expected to be the same as in Burma. According to a survey in Vietnam, the expected harvest is 3 million tons, with an estimated surplus of 104,000 tons available for export.

### Hongjiang Tung Oil Market Weak

Hongjiang tung oil, of both the positive and negative grade had not been on the market for 7-8 years. Spring of this year, transportation returned and genuine western tung oil arrived in Shanghai. Counting Ji Ying Feng Da Chang Feng positive grade, Yang Heng Yuan, Xu Rong Chang, Xiao Heng Qing, Liu Qing Yuan Feng, Liu Tong Qing, Da You Feng, and Qing Yuan Feng brand of negative grades, the sales of the spring had passed, and the sales in the summer is not smooth due to the special situations in northern Yangtze. The sales place has almost disappeared, but the amount of tung oil has remained sizable. And the Hongjiang oil manufactured here has been sold for years, even if genuine tung oil comes, it cannot be completely removed, which also suppresses sales. Recently, Ji Ying Li's positive grade is selling at 90,000 yuan, Da Chang is 75,000 yuan, the prices of western negative grades are 62,000 yuan. The sales are not great and the market is weak.

### Letter to the Editor: Another Estimate of Cotton Harvest; At Most 150 Jin Per Mu; Requires a Loss of Nearly 63,000 Yuan

Your newspaper's June 21st commercial news column, "Uneven Joy and Suffering for Yarn and Cotton, Products Even Harder to Sustain," provided a detailed account of the excessively high profits of yarn factories and the encroachment of foreign cotton on the market, with little interest in domestically produced cotton garments, which was quite timely. However, the section on "those in the cotton garment industry" seems to be a miscalculation.

Your newspaper stated that "Our country's cotton fields can yield three dan of seed cotton per mu, with each dan currently priced at 30,000 yuan, totaling approximately 90,000 yuan."

In reality, the average yield of cotton fields in our country is only one dan of seed cotton per mu. Receiving 150 jin is considered a bumper year, while a poor year yields only 30 to 40 jin. Therefore, the market price of seed cotton and rice in our country is often in a ratio of 3 to 2. That is, before the war, the price of one shi of rice was 10 yuan, while the price of one dan of seed cotton was 15 yuan. This is based on the production volume of cotton and rice and represents the natural cost. Currently, the price of one dan of seed cotton is 30,000 yuan, while the price of one shi of rice is 50,000 yuan. This means that the actual value of cotton has decreased by 60%. If this continues, how can cotton farmers survive? The current crisis of rural bankruptcy is severe, especially for cotton farmers. It is hoped that those with knowledge will provide assistance, which is desired. As for the cost per mu of cotton fields (based on current market prices), details are provided below.

Land rent: Four dou of rice, priced at 50,000 yuan per shi, is 22,500 yuan. Average bean cake, 1.5 cakes, priced at 10,000 yuan per cake, is 15,000 yuan. Cotton seeds, 14 jin, priced at 100 yuan per jin, is 1,400 yuan. Spring plowing (planting cotton), four labor days, priced at 5,000 yuan per day, is 20,000 yuan. Mid-season cultivation (thinning cotton), ten labor days, priced at 3,000 yuan per day, is 30,000 yuan. Autumn harvest (picking cotton) is 6,000 yuan. Also (pulling cotton stalks) is 5,000 yuan. In total, each mu requires 99,900 yuan. The harvest is an average of one dan of seed cotton, priced at 30,000 yuan (current market price). Cotton stalks and firewood, an average of two dan, are priced at 7,000 yuan, totaling 37,000 yuan in revenue per mu. The loss per mu of cotton field is 62,900 yuan.

The above estimates are based on essential calculations. The wages of agricultural workers have also increased significantly, exceeding approximately double the pre-war level (pre-war, each labor day was equivalent to approximately four to five sheng of rice, while now each labor day is equivalent to one dou of rice) due to the impact of the increased wages of factory workers.

### A Positive Mentality

— Wang Ying

When the environment is not favorable, those who operate businesses generally have a negative mentality, believing that there is no hope for the future. This mentality, whether among business operators or laborers, is harmful to the business itself.

In fact, any kind of difficulty can be overcome with effort. Many unfavorable situations can become a thing of the past after a certain period of time.

In the current situation, the general manufacturing industry is in a precarious state, fearing great difficulties in the future and unsure of how to cope. In reality, as long as they work diligently and put in extra effort, they can turn thorny situations into smooth ones after a certain period of time.

### Current State of China's Mechanical Industry

— Deng Qi

Some say: The reason for China's lack of strength is that its industry is undeveloped, an important factor. But the underdevelopment of industry is actually due to the decline of the mechanical industry, with no one paying attention to promoting it or investing in it. To this day, China's mechanical industry is still in a state of dire need. Isn't it? The American Ford Motor Company can manufacture a streamlined car in five minutes (which is a fact), but looking around China, there is a great lack of talent. In fact, how many cars, new or old, can be manufactured? Of course, not to mention other, larger, and more complex mechanical tools. Therefore, every year, the amount of machinery our country imports from the United States is staggeringly large.

The scope of the mechanical industry is quite extensive, ranging from small foundries and woodworking shops (for making molds) to large arsenals and shipyards. The size of the work also depends on the size of the factory, from small daily-use nails and screws to large items such as bicycles, automobiles, and heavy brakes, spinning machines and carding machines in textile mills, and artillery and machine guns for war. According to statistics from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, there are currently no more than a thousand large and small mechanical factories in China (including medium and above-sized foundries and woodworking shops), and less than half of them can manufacture nails and screws. As a result, various other machines have to be purchased from the United States and other places. The total number of various sizes of machinery in China is about 200,000, far less than one-third of Japan's.

The biggest problem hindering China's mechanical industry is that the government has not provided incentives, and capitalists have not promoted it or invested in it as a result. This is the first point. The lack of talent and the low wages of mechanical workers is the second. The old and former mechanical engineers do not think about improvement and research, and the cost is always much higher than that of foreign countries. Therefore, most customers tend to purchase from foreign countries. More generally, mechanical factories lack business strategies, and most of them act independently and lack coordination. This is the third point.

Therefore, in the post-victory era, under the slogan of revitalizing industry on the road to China's construction, how to seek the development of China's mechanical industry is also an urgent matter. Now, based on my limited knowledge, I would like to offer three points, and I hope that domestic experts will not hesitate to give their valuable advice.

(1) In view of the current situation, the government should urgently promote and encourage capitalists to invest. This is one aspect. On the other hand, it is necessary to first have unified management of the existing mechanical factories in China, regardless of their size or nature. For example, the work of the Suzhou, Zhejiang, and Anhui Machinery Receival Group of the Ministry of Economic Affairs is extremely complicated. Several factories in Shanghai that were taken over from the enemy and puppets, such as the Huxi Aigong and other nine factories, often ended up in a chaotic situation. Moreover, just when a certain factory was said to have been completely reorganized, it was about to resume work or had been working for a long time, it was suddenly taken over by personnel sent by the Executive Yuan. Past events, up to the recent Shanghai machine repair engineering industry, are not as well-organized as under the enemy and puppets. Everything seems disorganized and without direction. And Shanghai's mechanical engineering is the most developed area in China. If Shanghai is in such a state now, what about other places?

(2) The training of talent should be accelerated urgently. There is a great lack of mechanical engineering talent in China. In many of the machinery factories taken over from the enemy and puppets this time, we simply do not have anyone who is qualified to take over the position. Therefore, even now, the Japanese technical personnel are still being used. According to a recent announcement by the Ministry of Education, it is planning to establish more engineering schools and accelerate the training of technical talent. But it must be understood that, conversely, there is an extreme shortage of teachers for this training, and attention should also be paid to student experimentation. But now, building a substandard student factory costs at least 50,000,000 yuan.

(3) The salaries of mechanical engineering talent and machinists should be increased, at least to the same level as civil servants. And there should also be some protection for their lives. For example, the salary of a factory director or engineer is still around 150,000 yuan, and it is common to be crushed into pulp by the machine if one is not careful. Who would be willing to work in mechanical engineering in this case?

According to very reliable sources, our country has requested Japan to compensate for our country's war losses with all of its domestic machinery, large and small, totaling more than 500,000 units. This is a very gratifying thing!

### My Views on Revitalizing the Silk Industry

— Cong

Since the restoration, there have been many articles about the "silkworm" business in magazines and newspapers, which proves that the people of the country have turned their attention to the "silkworm" business! If we summarize these "silkworm" documents, in addition to a part that is reporting in nature, many are emphasizing that "silkworms" occupy a particularly important position in China's agriculture, industry, and commerce, and now is a great time to revitalize China's "silk" business. The authorities should encourage the "mulberry and silkworm" business, establish silk schools, and provide silk industry loans, and other such beneficial views. After reading, the author has two additional points to add for the consideration of people in this field and the authorities.

(1) Popularize Silk Education: To thoroughly improve "silkworm" education, nothing less than a full set of general mobilization will do. In addition to increasing the quantity of university silkworm education, the quality needs to be enriched, and we need to catch up with the world's standards at a fast pace. Middle school silkworm education should not only create more specialized schools, but also insert a large amount of "silkworm" teaching materials into the biology curriculum of ordinary middle schools to meet the needs of the national silkworm business. As for elementary schools, it is possible to instill common silkworm knowledge within the scope, which seems to be the most practical benefit for the majority of elementary school students who stay in rural areas.

(2) Solve the Mulberry Tree Problem: This problem is to solve the problem of obtaining mulberry fields and mulberry seedlings. If the existing cultivated land is moved to mulberry fields, it is of course cutting flesh to mend sores, abandoning the root and pursuing the branch, destroying the countryside, and weakening production, which is not a good method. We should open up new sources and make good use of barren land - the dikes and slopes of hills, beaches, inland rivers and ponds, the vicinity of rural residential houses, the four sides of cemeteries and tombs...etc. to make the best use of the land and avoid abandoning goods on the land. As for mulberry seedlings, we should naturally choose excellent varieties and supply them as much as possible. After a few years, we can have the prototype of a "Silkworm Kingdom".

In this national production and construction upsurge, the author ventures to provide the above two points to express his concern for production and construction, and hopes that knowledgeable people will give their advice!

### The Future of Flat Knitting Hosiery Factories

Since China has had a knitting industry, it has only been about thirty or forty years, but the beginning of hand-cranked flat knitting hosiery factories is still a recent thing.

The knitting industry includes all weaving industries. All woven clothing does not have warp threads, and is smooth and comfortable to wear. Sweatshirts and socks are all made in this way. Ordinary socks have the same number of stitches on the calf and ankle, that is to say, the thick and thin parts of the foot are the same size. However, when manufacturing, the sock mouth is loosened a bit to allow it to be stretched when worn. However, socks that are stretched hard are not perfect after all, especially women's long stockings, where the difference in size between the thigh and the ankle can be several times. For this reason, flat knitting hosiery factories have emerged.

Flat knitting stockings have different numbers of stitches in the thigh and ankle. Starting from the thigh, the size is reduced according to the thickness of the thigh, so they fit comfortably on the foot and are popular with women.

Before the war, the machines used to weave these stockings were American electric machines, which produced very quickly. Only the Defeng Knitting Factory in Shanghai had four machines. When the Pacific War broke out, production was suspended due to a lack of parts. Therefore, someone invented a hand-cranked flat knitting machine, which could make about half a dozen stockings per machine per day. Although the output was slow, the quality was similar to that of electric machines, but the elasticity was slightly worse. Therefore, in the past few years, because electric machines were suspended and there were no imported products on the market, hand-cranked flat knitting hosiery factories in Shanghai sprung up like mushrooms after rain. Although sea transportation is now open, American nylon stockings cost 70,000 yuan per pair, while self-woven stockings cost only 10,000 yuan per pair. Since stockings are a luxury item, the government prohibits imports, so hand-cranked stockings still have a market. There are currently about 30 flat knitting hosiery factories in Shanghai, but they are all small in scale. Most of them have one and a half machines. The larger scale is the Hefeng Knitting Factory, which has more than five machines and all the necessary auxiliary equipment such as spinning machines. The raw material, "silk," is made by the factory's silk factory department.

Hand-cranked flat knitting stockings are a luxury item in terms of output. However, in the face of foreign goods flooding the market, it is enough to recover leakage. It is also a transitional tool when electric machine factories cannot be established. (Ren Hengliang)

### An Overview of Industrial and Commercial Management

— Xu Baiyi

Sometimes, due to economic reasons, it is not possible to buy vacant land to build a factory building. In that case, there are several methods:

A. Rent Land to Build a House. Lease land from the landlord, stipulate a term, the annual rent, and the method after the expiration of the term.

B. Purchase Existing Factory Buildings. There are two situations here, one is with the land, and the other is also renting the land.

C. Rent a Factory Building. In this situation, the future equipment issues must be considered. Because after renting a factory building, it is necessary to renovate or remodel it. The contract often stipulates that after the expiration of the term, the tenant should restore the original state, then the equipment and renovations installed will have to be removed, which will inevitably become a loss and must be considered in advance.

B. Factory Building Style

The Purpose of a Factory Building: The purpose of a factory building is to shelter machines, equipment, raw materials in manufacturing, and finished products. A factory building must have the following conditions:

A. A good foundation for the equipment.

B. Manufacturing work can proceed smoothly.

C. Good ventilation, dryness, and sufficient light, so that workers can work comfortably.

D. Sufficient space to store raw materials and finished products.

The above four points are the basic conditions of a factory building. In addition, the money spent is for decoration or protection of the building.

B. Factory Building Style

Factory buildings can be divided into three types. The first type is a single-story factory building, with the roof in a sawtooth shape. This type of roof is usually called a Saw-Tooth Roof.

The second type is one with glass sheds or roofs on top. On both sides of the large factory building, there are sometimes lower factory buildings.

The third type is a whole building.

Among the above three types of factory buildings, the first and second types are more convenient to build, especially suitable for temporary factory buildings. The third type of whole building must be strong. Walls, pillars, and floors must all be considered. However, there is also one place where the construction cost can be reduced, and that is the reduction in the number of roofs, because the whole building only needs a small number of roofs, unlike the first type of building, which needs a roof for each floor.

Ultimately, which type of factory building should be chosen depends on the following circumstances:

A. How much land is available to build which type of factory building?

B. Which type of factory building is needed for the goods being manufactured?

C. Which type of factory building can be built economically?

D. Which type of factory building is most suitable in terms of the time period (referring to renting land, etc.)?

Other Points to Consider in the Factory Building.

A. Machine Weight: In some factories, because the weight of the machines is very light, the construction of the factory building can be simpler. As long as it can accommodate workers and the necessary equipment and is not invaded by wind and rain, it is sufficient. However, in factories that require very heavy machines, the factory building must naturally be strong. In addition, factories that manufacture sophisticated items, such as clock factories, must not have any vibration. Vibration prevention is not simply a matter of firmness. Construction experts can find ways to solve this for manufacturers. Fortunately, before building a factory building, it is necessary to consult with an architect. At that time, it is necessary to tell them the needs of the factory so that the factory building they design can meet the needs of the factory.

B. Flooring: Many people have a bad feeling about concrete floors because they are very cold. This is because concrete can absorb the heat from people's feet. At the same time, a person's walking is related to habit. For example, a person who is accustomed to walking on dirt roads is prone to fatigue once he walks on modern streets. Similarly, a person who is accustomed to walking in the city will feel tired after walking for a while in the countryside.

At the same time, people who are accustomed to doing mental work have cold feet because most of the blood in their body goes to the brain.

Most modern buildings use concrete floors, but if economic resources permit or if it is practically necessary, flooring can still be installed on top of the concrete.

In ordinary factory buildings, where the machines are not very heavy, wooden floors are more suitable. In single-story factory buildings, concrete floors are commonly used.

C. Fire Prevention: Fire prevention is very important for a factory building.

Under normal circumstances, factory buildings can be divided into the following two types:

A. Slow-Burning: These are factory buildings with brick walls on the outside, wooden windows and doors that are quite large, and wooden floors. These factory buildings are easy to catch fire, but if the fire is extinguished immediately, they will not be completely destroyed. Of course, after a fire, the appearance will be greatly affected.

B. Fireproof: These are built with steel and concrete. All windows and doors are made of steel. External fires will not be affected. Mostly, the things inside the factory building catch fire.

In modern factory buildings, when building, the head of an enterprise naturally needs to consider carefully how much money should be spent to make the factory building fireproof, how much fire insurance should be purchased, and how much fire prevention equipment should be installed in the factory building, such as fire extinguishers. A factory building is the production site of an enterprise, and safety and durability must be considered.

D. Temperature and Ventilation: Maintaining the temperature in the factory is very important. Firstly, it is closely related to the work in progress, and secondly, it is related to the work efficiency of the workers. If there is cold weather and no furnace or concrete, the work efficiency of the two will immediately decrease. At the same time, the manufacture of many goods is very sensitive to temperature, and it cannot be hot and cold.

In addition, the air inside the factory building must circulate to keep the air fresh. If the air is not circulating, the work efficiency will definitely decrease, and the health of the workers must also be protected.

### Demolishing Houses

— Shao Fu

Shanghai has all sorts of bizarre contradictions. Let's talk about one of them first:

On the one hand, there is a housing shortage. Everyone is using the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau as a hypothetical enemy, clamoring and clamoring, clamoring until it is unsatisfactory, and clamoring even more if it is unsuccessful. From the Management Bureau, the Central Trust Bureau, the Municipal Government, to the Executive Yuan Housing Allocation Committee, everyone is dizzy. The bone is still the same, and they bite each other until the fur falls off.

On the other hand, construction companies are empty, architects are sighing, and on the open space, a group of homeless people build some sheds to barely shelter from the wind and rain, but they are ordered to demolish them. Large numbers of police are dispatched at all costs.

What kind of world is this?

In the Subei area, the local area is uneasy, and the people are fleeing one after another, and the number of people who come to Shanghai is particularly large. It can be said that these people have exhausted their family property and are in a very difficult situation. It is already their last effort to barely scrape together some money to build one or two thatched huts. How can they withstand such a blow now?

We are clamoring about the housing shortage every day, and even turning to the idea of ​​active houses in the United States;

We are calling for relief for the Subei refugees every day;

This is something that cannot be explained.

Why let the open space remain empty? (If the landlord really builds a house, then that's another matter.) Why do the police have the right to demolish people's houses?

Wise municipal authorities, please answer these questions for us!

### The Mysterious Café

— Bian Shan

A place so dark you can't see anything.

One weekend, by chance, I came to this place.

If you have a lover, if you want to pour out your heart, and if you are still mindful of her shyness, you will definitely exclaim: What, there is such a good place!

Yes, this fake place is not bad - no, it's too good! The entire room is divided into 20 "rooms" (saying "rooms" is really just a thin partition). Only a dim light in the middle is distributed to each room. Dimness and darkness envelop each other, and music has no legs to run here. Yes, there is no good tune here, or it is simply suffocating. However, you definitely haven't felt these things. What you can feel is excitement. When the person you are holding on your arm is your lover with a very high temperature, your heart may burst out!

When you two sit down, when you order something simple in the tea room, the "waiter" will never rudely touch the door you have occupied again, until you are tired of having fun after a few hours and press the doorbell to tell him that you should end your transaction - the price of two cups of coffee.

In this small room, not a trace of impudent and greedy eyes can be shot in from the outside. If you have had the experience of coming here once, then you will be bolder and do whatever you want. The high tide of passionate indulgence and the impulse of environmental pressure will make you understand the intention of this space setting.

The price of drinks is exceptionally high. Coffee that only sells for 900 yuan a cup elsewhere sells for 1,500 yuan here. However, you don't feel that things are too expensive here because you are too excited. You will love this place as much as you love your lover. You will dream of coming again next time, and you may even instruct the "waiter" to reserve a seat for you at a certain time the next day.

Where is this café? You really want to know, right! Do you want me to tell you? However, I will definitely disappoint you here, because not only have I not yet been appointed as the café's publicity officer, but also, telling you is in vain. There are no extra seats to be found there every day, except for the few ordinary seats in the middle. However, if you are a smart person, you will definitely find such a good "place" yourself. In order to meet the needs of a considerable number of the city's four million people, there are such places everywhere!

### Blue White Ambition: Intending to Independently Conquer Australia

— Lin Huai

Since defeating Xingdong, Blue White's momentum has surged, and the situation has greatly changed. It was previously said that Xingdong intended to pull Blue White players to Australia together, but negotiations have stalled for the time being due to difficulties. Blue White believes it is strong and capable, more than capable of defeating Xingdao (Singapore), and is unwilling to be dependent on others. Therefore, it only expressed "appreciation" for Xingdong's good intentions. Xingdong's biggest distress lies in its goalkeeper, the weakest point in the entire team, deeply feeling that it is more likely to fail than succeed, which greatly impacts the entire "fate." Therefore, it intends to find another suitable person. It is rumored that they had considered the Italian immigrant goalkeeper, Tair Ka, an Italian player who participated in the Olympic Games and is an expert in soccer. However, upon further reflection, it felt inappropriate to suddenly introduce an Italian into a Chinese soccer team, which seemed out of place, causing much dilemma. If they were to negotiate with Blue White again, Blue White, as the victor, would have high demands, making it practically very difficult. This trip to Australia will involve many strong teams, and if they fail to impress, they will inevitably lose money, making it inconvenient to venture across the ocean and risk everything. Furthermore, after the cooperation between Blue White and Xingdong fell through, seeing Xingdao's successful tour, Blue White also has the idea of independently embarking on an expedition to Australia. However, Blue White's biggest difficulty is the lack of substantial capital. At the same time, entering Australia requires a considerable deposit. Although defeating Xingdong boosted their morale, they are unsure if they can be absolutely confident after arriving in Australia, causing a great psychological conflict. But on the other hand, both teams actually have shortcomings. If each goes its own way, it will likely lead to mutual harm. Therefore, for the sake of a successful expedition, merging the two teams is more suitable. However, since both sides intend to act independently, even if the plan to go to Australia is realized, it is unlikely to achieve satisfactory results. From this, we can speculate that although Blue White has ambition, it is unknown whether the backstage boss can confidently support this venture, which is worth pondering.

### Qingshan Temple

After wandering in Hong Kong for eight or nine years, experiencing all the hardships of life and enduring everything given by barbarians, there are two places I most like to linger: one is Repulse Bay near Stanley, and the other is Qingshan Temple outside Kowloon. The former is a place to enjoy modern urban civilization, while the latter is a cool place to wash away worries. Four years ago, I used to visit these two places several times a year, but I never had to spend any money myself (in fact, I had no money to spend), and I always went by private car. Let's leave Repulse Bay for now; there are many good things to say about Qingshan Temple.

I used to visit Qingshan with several people, and I was the accompanying guest in this group. We would first take a car to the United Ferry Pier in Central, and a ferry would carry us and the car to Tsim Sha Tsui in Kowloon. After landing, we would usually go to a curry restaurant on Nathan Road for a hearty meal, and then speed along the winding mountain road to Qingshan Pier. From there, we would take a small boat to Qingshan Town and walk up to Qingshan. There is a pine path to follow up Qingshan, and there are pavilions halfway up the mountain to rest. It is most interesting to walk slowly with the group until everyone is covered in fine sweat. Upon arriving, we would first rest in a large "shed" made of sunflower leaves and bamboo, where the welcoming monk would serve tea. A cool mountain breeze blows from all directions, and the "shed" is large and does not let in any sunlight, so it is impossible not to doze off after sitting for a long time. Every time I went there, I would sleep in the "shed" and then wander around a bit. Strictly speaking, there is no place to wander around; there are only a few temple halls with Buddhist statues no different from other temples. Occasionally, you might hear a bell ringing once or twice, and you might see monks performing midday services in the main hall. However, the courtyards are more numerous than those of Linggu Temple in Nanjing, and since it is nestled halfway up the mountain, the atmosphere is naturally different. Behind the temple is a shallow cave with a large fish bone, several feet long, which the monks call the "Neng Bone" (miraculous bone). There is also a small hall presided over by an old nun, where devout men and women seek fortune and divination. There is also a rock inscribed with the five large characters "The First Mountain Under Heaven," said to be written by Han Yu (Han Wengong). I have never verified this.

Looking out from the temple, it appears very majestic, and the origin of the mountain's name is quite intriguing. But I don't want to talk about that. The abbot is said to be quite influential among Cantonese monks, and the temple's property is quite abundant, but it is said that the abbot's nephew has spent a lot of it. The welcoming monk is a vulgar fellow, but he has learned a few phrases of "fortune-telling" and always says a couple of lines to the patrons, at most two lines. Believe it or not.

Visiting Qingshan Temple usually involves eating a vegetarian lunch ("zhai" in Cantonese). When people arrive at the "shed," the welcoming monk comes to arrange it. The "zhai" tastes very delicious, especially for those who are used to eating meat and occasionally have a vegetarian meal. There is also wine to drink, and having a slight buzz makes you appreciate the goodness of Qingshan Temple even more.

In a word, visiting Qingshan Temple can make people completely forget worldly worries because the environment is very secluded, without the phenomena of sycophancy and power struggles. But it cannot make you forget yourself.

I have long thought of going there to recuperate. I believe it is the most suitable place for recuperation in Hong Kong, but I do not have the financial resources to do so.

For more than four years, I have almost forgotten about it because no one in Hong Kong has had the freedom or convenience to go to Qingshan Temple in the past four years. Even now, people are still hesitant to go there. This great famous mountain and this great famous temple can only be enjoyed by woodcutters and shepherds. This is because of the transportation and the fact that public order has not been restored.

### The Mystery of Personality

— Dongfang Jing

Dr. Raymond Cattell, a psychology professor at Duke University and an authority on personality issues, has recently successfully researched a new personality system—using simple numbers to represent a person's personality traits.

To easily understand Cattell's new system, let's assume that everyone in the world has a "personality number," like the number on an athlete's jersey. When you see "29111" on the back of that tall guy, you can immediately determine that "he is a person with brains, but that's about it."

Another fellow is "81354," indicating that his intelligence is very low, but his character is very good. If two girls walk by, one is "44981" and the other is "44129," you can know that the first one is suspicious and reclusive; the second one has a cheerful, sociable soul.

Of course, making these personality numbers public is impossible. However, it can help individuals choose careers and select suitable talent for public office.

Dr. Cattell said, "Perhaps one day, psychologists will be needed to measure the personality traits of political candidates."

Before arriving at this simple system, Cattell did a lot of meticulous preparatory work. He first selected all the words describing personality from the dictionary, about four thousand or more, and then gradually eliminated similar ones, finally reducing them to one hundred and seventy-one.

The second step was to test these one hundred and seventy-one personality traits on hundreds of people. From this, it could be seen which traits often occurred together, and they were reduced again.

After completing the final statistical analysis, Dr. Cattell completed twelve basic personality factors, from which the main characteristics of personality can be measured.

For example, if a person is bohemian, the following characteristics are most strongly expressed in their personality: joy, kindness, rich emotions, informality, and sociability.

Dr. Cattell represents each person's personality with a numerical equation. For example, if a person is "5w, 8g, 4f, 1p2c," it can be known that he is a person of good character, high intelligence, straightforward, but not very good at socializing.

"In fact, the ultimate nature of any problem is a personality problem," said Dr. Cattell. "Whether you are studying the causes of war, improving education, or the problem of unemployment, in the end, it is all related to personality."

### This season, the number of people going to Coney Island (near Sanshen City) for summer heat relief is even more enthusiastic than before. At 79 degrees Fahrenheit, there are already 900,000 tourists. Most of them are strolling on the beach, and the sea breeze is still very cool.

Legal Inquiries

(1) Mr. Li Zicui asks: My friend, Mr. Jia, knew Miss Yi in his early years. Both parties had deep feelings, but were separated for several years due to the war. Recently, they met again in Shanghai, and Yi told Jia that she had been betrothed to Bing three years ago by her aunt, who acted as her guardian and hired a matchmaker. However, they have not yet married, and Yi and Bing are fundamentally different in character and difficult to grow old together. Yi wants to cancel the engagement with Bing (and her aunt also agrees) and reunite with Jia. Fortunately, Jia has never married. 1. Will Jia be punished by law? 2. Can Yi automatically cancel the engagement with Bing? 3. Does Bing have the legal right to interfere with Jia and Yi? 4. Is the union of Jia and Yi in accordance with the law? 5. If Bing is lazy and pretends to ignore it, can Yi have the right to publish an automatic public announcement to make it valid? I would appreciate it if you could provide instructions on the above five questions.

[Answer from Lawyer Cao Yaxia] 1. No. 2. Yes, but only if she is of legal age (20 years old). 3. After the engagement is terminated, he has no right to interfere. 4. Both must be of legal age, or if they are not of legal age, they must have the consent of their legal representative to comply with the law. 5. Invalid. If the engagement was not made by the party themselves and they never agreed to it, then they may sue for termination after reaching adulthood.

(2) Zhao Yangxu asks: I was engaged to Miss Cha last year through a matchmaker, with her guardians, her aunt and uncle, acting as principals. After five months, the woman left without saying goodbye, and there has been no news for a year now. 1. Can I unilaterally terminate the engagement, and what kind of procedure is effective? 2. If the woman interferes when I remarry or get engaged after the termination, what legal method should I use to resolve it? 3. Before the termination, if I can find the woman or the original matchmaker and I ask to marry, but the other party is not sincere or deliberately cunning, and therefore inevitably leads to the termination, can I demand the return of the ornaments and engagement fees at the time of the engagement, and the loss of the termination fee, or be jointly responsible for it.

[Answer from Lawyer Liu Yaxia] 1. If the woman's whereabouts are unknown for more than a year, you can unilaterally sue for termination of the engagement based on this. 2. The woman cannot interfere. 3. If the marriage date is far away, the engagement can also be terminated according to the law. The non-defaulting party can request compensation from the defaulting party for the damages suffered as a result.

### Charitable Relief

Letter to the Editor: The disaster in Hunan Province is severe, and our compatriots urgently need relief. Shanghai is the economic center of the country, and the enthusiasm of Shanghai citizens for public welfare has always been the best in the country.

I am now sending 6,000 yuan in cash as a donation for the Hunan disaster from Yongyu and my father, Yunshan, my wife, Taishu, and my young children, Chunga, Chunrong, and Chunchong, 1,000 yuan each. I hope all sectors of society will actively donate and contribute to charitable acts. Respectfully, Ying Yongyu, to Shen Bao.
