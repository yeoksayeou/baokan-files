[Central News Agency, Changchun, 14th] On this day of the final withdrawal of Soviet troops, battles broke out in three areas on the outskirts of Changchun. One of them was at Jiatun, seven kilometers southwest, which was attacked by the communist army at 4:30 AM this morning, and was repelled by the local garrison after four hours. Another location was Sangjiawopu, near the airfield. According to officials, there were approximately 2,500 to 3,000 communist soldiers there, launching an attack on the airfield in three directions. The battle situation was quite tense. The 13th Regiment of the 4th Security Brigade stationed in the suburbs dispatched a team to assist, and the communist army's offensive was slightly weakened. By 10:00 AM, both sides were in a stalemate. Another location was near Lvyuan, midway between the city and the airfield. The battle there is currently underway. In addition, the 6th Branch of the City Police Bureau near Weichengzi was occupied by the communist army this evening, which is very close to Changchun and poses the greatest threat to Changchun.

[Another dispatch] The battle near the airfield on the morning of the 14th, after a four-and-a-half-hour standoff, became fierce again at 3:30 PM in the afternoon. At 5:00 PM, the communist army had approached the edge of the airport, and several shells fell into the field. A plane flew from Shenyang to Harbin today. The plane was originally scheduled to land here in the morning and then fly to Harbin. When the plane flew here, because there was a battle near the airport, it flew directly to Harbin. At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, the plane returned from Harbin and landed at the airport during a temporary lull in the fighting.

### Occupying Changchun for 228 Days, Karlov Leads Troops Northward, Wartime Rule of Soviet Army Completely Eliminated

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 14th] Major General Karlov, the city defense commander of the Soviet army, led his headquarters personnel and the last batch of Soviet troops by train northward at 10:20 AM on the 14th. The wartime rule imposed on Changchun by the Soviet army was completely eliminated. From this day on, Changchun City truly gained liberation, and our army officially took over the city's defense. Municipal administration is no longer subject to external interference. According to reports, the Soviet army entered Changchun on August 19th last autumn, lasting for a total of 228 days. When Karlov led his troops to leave Changchun today, Major General Chen Jiazhen, a member of our country's military delegation and commander of the Changchun defense, went to the station to see them off. The two had originally agreed to meet and talk at 9:00 AM on the 14th, but it was temporarily canceled and changed to a meeting at the station. Three minutes before the train departed, Chinese and Soviet send-off personnel raised their glasses together on the train to wish Karlov a safe journey. Karlov and Chen also took a photo together at the station as a souvenir. The reporter has been in Changchun for half a year and is now talking to the Soviet general who was once the wartime ruler of Changchun for the first time. He instructed the reporter to tell the citizens of Changchun that he was very grateful for the assistance he received from all parties during his stay. The reporter accompanied five American reporters who had just arrived here yesterday and ventured to the station. The American reporters did not intend to interview the last Soviet general who left. They came to see the final withdrawal of the Soviet army. While the reporter and two other Chinese reporters stepped forward to deal with Major General Karlov, the five American reporters strolled on the station. Someone asked Karlov if he would like to talk to the American reporters. Karlov said no. According to reports, three of the five American reporters had previously come to Changchun to talk with Karlov, but today they did not exchange a single word. Before leaving, Karlov told Major General Chen Jiazhen that there were still three Soviet soldiers in Changchun city who did not make it onto the train due to some matters, and there were no other Soviet troops in the city.

[Another dispatch] Although the Soviet army has withdrawn from here, the Soviet flag still flies over some buildings. In front of these buildings, there are many wooden signs with the words "This building and everything in it belongs to the Soviets". The reporter saw some of the most solid and beautiful new-style residences currently being renovated. They all said they were purchased from the Japanese. There are also some buildings where newly moved Soviet expatriates live, many of whom claim to be employees of the China Chang Railway. However, some people have confirmed that many of them have worn Soviet military uniforms, and suspicious-looking Chinese people are often seen entering and leaving their residences.

[Another dispatch] The 800,000 citizens of Changchun, who were ruled by the Soviet army for eight months less five days, did not show any obvious expressions on the day of the final departure of the Soviet army. They may have felt relieved when they saw the Soviet flag on the city defense headquarters being lowered. However, this feeling was instantly disturbed by the sound of gunfire from a distance. Although they mostly deal with the current situation with a silent attitude, they raised 800,000 circulation coupons yesterday to comfort the security team defending Changchun, which should appropriately represent their language.

### Military Mediation Department Reaffirms Previous Order: Each Army Should Return to Position on January 13

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 14th] The Beiping Military Mediation Executive Department recently issued Order No. 6 to thoroughly clarify military disputes in various places, admonishing the government and Communist armies to remain stationed at the positions they held at 12:00 noon on January 13th of this year. Any troops that have crossed the above positions should withdraw immediately. Commanders should strictly implement this order, and executive groups should supervise and guide them. However, the execution of this task should not hinder the opening of transportation lines or the execution of other orders of the Executive Department. Any commander who does not obey the order to withdraw to the aforementioned position will be deemed to have violated the ceasefire order. This order was issued by Chairman Chiang of the National Government and Executive Department members Zheng Jiemin, Robertson, and Ye Jianying, with an attachment stipulating that, to restore the positions at midnight on January 13th, senior commanders on the government side and senior commanders on the Communist side should convene a meeting under the Executive Group.

The purpose of the meeting is to submit reports on the respective locations at midnight on January 13th and, to the greatest extent possible, adjust the conflict appeals of the commanders. Recently, the Taiyuan, Jinan, and Shijiazhuang groups have been working hard to convene this meeting.

### Political Consultative Conference Subcommittee Discusses Draft Constitution, Three Points Agreed Upon, National Assembly Delegate Quota Decided to Be Expanded

[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 14th] The Political Consultative Conference Comprehensive Subcommittee continued to meet yesterday. The delegates first stood up and observed three minutes of silence for Wang Ruofei and Qin Bangxian. Then, they discussed the relationship between the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan in the draft constitution. All parties agreed on three points: (1) The Legislative Yuan has the right to consult the Executive Yuan, and the Executive Yuan has the obligation to report on its administration to the Legislative Yuan. (2) If difficulties arise when the Executive Yuan implements a resolution submitted by the Legislative Yuan, it may request the President to submit it to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration. If two-thirds or more agree, the original proposal will be maintained. (3) If the Executive Yuan believes that a certain legislation is necessary, it may submit it to the President to submit to the Legislative Yuan. If it obtains the consent of two-thirds or more, it can be discussed. However, because the government representative proposed to cancel the first article of the Legislative Yuan and the Executive Yuan's responsible relationship in the original draft constitution modification principles of the Political Consultative Conference, that is, to cancel the assertion that the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan are responsible, the Executive Yuan should be responsible to the President, and the President should be responsible to the National Assembly. The Communist Party and the Democratic League could not agree to this and insisted on retaining it, so a complete agreement was not reached. Subsequently, it was decided that each party would send one person to jointly organize the points agreed upon in the previous discussions and write them into a written record. Yesterday's meeting was attended by Lu Dingyi representing the Communist Party, Chen Qitian and Chang Yansheng representing the Youth Party, and the rest remained the same.

[Agence France-Presse, Chongqing, 13th] The Comprehensive Subcommittee of the Political Consultative Conference met this afternoon and decided to submit the entire issue of the draft constitution to the Constitutional Review Committee for discussion. Wang Shijie, the representative of the Kuomintang, has submitted the government reorganization plan to the Comprehensive Subcommittee. The Comprehensive Subcommittee has decided to increase the number of National Assembly representatives from 2,050 to 2,400. The Communist Party and the Democratic League should still account for one-quarter of the total, so that they can exercise their veto power. According to this calculation, they can only be given 600 seats, but the Communist Party insists on asking for 650 seats, so no agreement has been reached. In short, the two sides still have different opinions on the two major issues of the mutual relationship between the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan and the distribution of the number of non-Kuomintang members of the National Government Committee.

### Zhou Enlai Receives Reporters

[United Press, Chongqing, 14th] Zhou Enlai, the Communist representative in Chongqing, received newspaper reporters today, stating: The situation in the Northeast has developed into a state of "civil war". In this state, the Communist army reserves the right to counterattack. The Communist army besieging Changchun has "full political rights" and may occupy the city when the Soviet army withdraws as scheduled today. General Marshall is now on his way back to Chongqing and will find that the situation in China is far more critical than he expected when he went to Washington a month ago. When asked what steps Special Envoy Marshall could take to resolve the situation in China, Zhou said: He hopes that General Marshall will take any necessary steps in the spirit of fairness in the past. Unless military and political issues are resolved, the Communist Party will not participate in the National Assembly. If an agreement is reached on a ceasefire in the Northeast, amending the draft constitution, people's freedom, and compliance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, then the Communist Party has no reason to refuse to attend the National Assembly. There are still 20 days before the opening of the National Assembly. If no progress is made in resolving the above issues, the possibility of a complete compromise within these 20 days is extremely slim.

### Iranian Government Instructs Ambassador to the U.S. to Offer Guarantees to the Security Council; Commits to Fulfilling Soviet Agreement; Says Part of Soviet Troops Have Withdrawn from Azerbaijan Province; Soviets Defend Delay in Troop Withdrawal

[Our Newspaper Report] London, 14th Broadcast: The Iranian Prime Minister today sent a new instruction by telegram to the Iranian representative to the Security Council, Ahle, guaranteeing to the Security Council that the Soviet-Iranian agreement will be fully implemented. According to highly reliable information, part of the Soviet troops stationed in Azerbaijan Province have already withdrawn. As soon as the withdrawal is complete, Iran will hold negotiations with the authorities in Azerbaijan.

[United Press, Tehran, 14th] Iranian Minister of Propaganda Firooz said today that the Iranian government has instructed its ambassador to the United States, Ahle, to declare to the United Nations Security Council that the Soviet-Iranian agreement stipulates that all Soviet troops will withdraw from Iran by May 5. The Iranian government believes that the conditions of the agreement will be faithfully fulfilled, without any doubt. When asked whether the British instruction would lead to the removal of the Iranian case from the Security Council's agenda, Firooz said that this was a procedural matter that must be decided by the Security Council itself.

[Reuters, London, 14th] Forty-eight hours before the Security Council in New York discusses whether to withdraw the Iranian complaint, Moscow Radio officially broadcast a Soviet document defending the Red Army's continued stay in Iran beyond the deadline stipulated in the 1942 treaty. The document did not mention the British troops' entry into Iran simultaneously with the Soviet troops in 1941. It stated that the Red Army entered Iran according to the provisions of the 1921 Soviet-Iranian friendship treaty, which stipulates that the Red Army has the right to enter Iranian territory until the crisis is completely eliminated. The so-called crisis refers to the situation where a foreign country attempts to use Iran as a base for attacking the Soviet Union. Germany attempted to use Iran to attack the Soviet Union from the south. The entry of Soviet troops into Iran thwarted this German plan. Now that the threat from Germany has been eliminated, the Soviet troops have begun to withdraw from Iran. A Reuters diplomatic correspondent commented that the anti-Axis war ended victoriously last year, and the Soviets only recognized that the German threat was eliminated after the Soviet-Iranian oil agreement was signed. This is difficult to explain.

[U.S. News Service, Washington, 13th] The State Department announced today that the U.S. Ambassador to Iran, Murray, will return to the United States within the month due to illness.

It is understood that the Spanish government does not intend to formally submit this suggestion to the Security Council because Spain is not a member of the United Nations organization, unless a third party proposes it, which would be another matter.

[United Press, New York, 13th] Representatives from Poland and Mexico today expressed their readiness to oppose the proposal of the Franco government. However, it is not yet known whether they can obtain sufficient support in the Security Council to defeat Franco's suggestion. Some representatives said privately that Franco's suggestion is subject to conditions and may be difficult to accept.

After the ceremony, a banquet was held at the Communist Party headquarters, and a week-long honeymoon trip will be taken. This is Tokuda's first marriage. During his eighteen years of imprisonment, his bride and the bride's former husband regularly delivered food to the prison and handled all his private affairs on his behalf.

### Washington Anxious About Future of Four-Power Foreign Ministers Meeting; Believes Paris Peace Conference May Never Be Held

[United Press, Paris, 13th] It was announced here today that the French government has instructed its ambassadors to London, Washington, and Moscow to invite the foreign ministers of those countries to attend the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Meeting in Paris on April 25.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 12th Dispatch] While Washington officials remain silent on the future relationship between the U.S., Britain, the Soviet Union, and France in finally resolving the European issue, they hold a pessimistic view of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Meeting to be held on April 25, which may not only postpone the long-awaited Paris Peace Conference on May 1, but may also never be held. If this is the case, the wartime allies may sign peace treaties separately with the enemy countries. One theory is that the outcome of the meeting to be held in Paris on April 25 may be a split between the Soviet Union and the three Western democracies. The Baltimore Sun quoted an official as saying: According to information from the U.S., Britain, and France, the three countries may abandon further cooperation with the Soviet Union to complete the treaties with Germany and its vassals, and separately sign treaties with Italy, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania. It is learned that the United States plans to discuss the internationalization of the Ruhr and Rhineland regions with France after the April 25 meeting. If the four powers cannot reach a consensus, U.S. officials believe there are three possibilities: (1) Hold a peace conference to resolve the disputes; (2) Each country separately sign peace treaties with the former enemy countries; (3) The U.S., Britain, France, and other countries that can reach an agreement jointly sign peace treaties.

### Strange Social Phenomenon in Java; 200,000 Women Eager to Find Mates

[United Press, Los Angeles, 14th] Dutch novelist Fabricius recently told the public about the strange social phenomenon he saw in Java, saying that there are currently 200,000 women in Java who are eager to find male partners. Most of these women are Dutch or of mixed Dutch descent. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, they were isolated from men and imprisoned in concentration camps. For three and a half years, they did not see a Caucasian man, resulting in these women falling into a state of extreme depression. Once released, they went everywhere looking for nightclubs and refused to leave, talking about love all day long. Currently, the troops of the Netherlands, Australia, Britain, and the United States are helping these women solve their problems.

### Armenian Republic, One of the Soviet Union; Demands Turkey Return Territory; Georgian Republic Also Has Territorial Demands on Turkey

[Reuters, Moscow, 14th] Officials of the Armenian Soviet Republic and Armenian patriotic organizations abroad are openly demanding that territory currently within Turkish borders be returned to Armenia, and their voices are growing louder. The Georgian Soviet Republic also has territorial demands on Turkey, but its public sentiment is not as high as that of Armenia. Armenia is currently publicly demanding from Turkey the return of six provinces: Kars, Ardahan, Artvin, Van, Erzurum, and Erzinjan. The first three provinces were proposed last year, and the latter three were proposed at the beginning of this year. The reason is that the above-mentioned areas were forcibly ceded, and now they need to be recovered for security reasons. Armenia is a mountainous region and one of the smallest republics in the Soviet Union, with an area of approximately 30,000 square kilometers and a population of approximately 1.3 million. Its industry, agriculture, and culture have made considerable progress in the past 25 years. Georgia's demands on Turkey have so far only been mentioned twice in Moscow newspapers. The territory it demands is Ardahan, Artvin, Volto, Tatom, Bebute, Ispira, Gambusang, Kirosen, Trabzon, and Lazistan. Regarding Ardahan, Armenian patriots have also listed it among the demands, but their Soviet spokesmen have not included it.

Editorial

### Solving the Housing Crisis

Over the past month in Shanghai, many people seem to be feeling headaches from various problems, and the housing crisis is one of them. Disputes over housing rentals have been constant, and the key money (premium for renting) has been as high as dozens or even one or two hundred taels of gold. Some rents are even calculated in U.S. dollars or British pounds, which is truly shocking. Because of this, ordinary citizens feel even more severe pressure from the housing problem. While agencies and civil servants returning to Shanghai from the rear desperately need housing, they cannot afford such excessive and illegal demands and compete with wealthy merchants and large businesses. As a result, the problem becomes increasingly complex. The government cannot shirk its responsibility and must solve at least part of this problem, which is inevitable given the circumstances. Recently, as the repatriation of enemy aliens from Shanghai by the Executive Yuan is about to be completed, the houses they left behind are gradually becoming vacant. Taking advantage of this opportunity, the Executive Yuan specifically stipulated seven measures for allocating houses to various agencies in Shanghai and is preparing to form a committee to manage the allocation of houses. The motivation is naturally to try to come up with a solution to the housing crisis where no solution seems possible.

Originally, the primary task in nation-building is the well-being of the people. People have four basic needs: food, clothing, housing, and transportation. The government has a responsibility to find ways to satisfy these needs. Housing is one of them, so the "Outline of National Reconstruction" stipulates that the government must build houses to provide comfortable living for the people. In the cities within the recovered areas, too many houses were damaged after the war, and all places are experiencing a housing shortage. It is said that Nanjing is even worse than Shanghai. Shanghai has a population of 3.5 million, which may not be less than before the war, but in Nanshi, Zhabei, Jiangwan, Wusong, and the surrounding suburbs, ruined walls and broken buildings are everywhere. Nothing has been rebuilt in the past eight years. After the victory, both the government and the people were busy dealing with the immediate situation. Everyone felt overwhelmed, and no one thought about how to promote the construction of new houses. Except for occasional calls for so-called "affordable housing," no one has even mentioned the construction of temporary housing. Everyone only knows how to focus on the existing housing. This is the main cause of the housing crisis in Shanghai, and it is also the main cause of the housing crisis in all cities in the recovered areas. Therefore, tracing back to the source, the fundamental solution to the housing crisis should start with the rapid construction of new houses. How to raise funds, how to obtain materials, and how to gather workers are all within the scope of "construction," which cannot be elaborated on one by one. The prerequisite for encouraging construction is, first of all, to protect the property rights of owners and crack down on the illegal profiteering of "key money" (premium for renting).

Today, if we cannot solve the housing crisis fundamentally in one step, we must consider the next best option and focus on the pressing reality, seeking a partial solution first. We believe that the housing problems in Shanghai that urgently need to be resolved are nothing more than the following three points: (1) the difficulty for agencies and civil servants in finding housing; (2) the protection of the rights and interests of existing owners; and (3) the crackdown on illegal "key money" and "small rents." Based on these three points, we will review the measures stipulated by the Executive Yuan. We believe that although these measures are not perfect, they are still a temporary remedy in this time and place. However, relying solely on these measures is indeed not enough to completely solve the housing crisis.

First, the difficulty for agencies and civil servants in finding housing is a well-known fact. As far as agencies are concerned, Shanghai has few public properties to begin with. Currently, except for the houses originally owned by the Public Works Department and the Municipal Council of the two concessions, which can continue to be used, the rest need to be rented. The most difficult situation is for the civil servants who have returned to Shanghai from the rear, whether they are employees of government agencies or business agencies. After eight years of displacement, once they return, their houses have either been destroyed or their leases have been seized. They search everywhere and have nowhere to live. How can the government possibly justify them having to solve the housing problem under the heavy pressure of key money and small rents, relying only on their limited salaries? Even if the government cannot solve the housing problem for all the citizens of the city, to be fair and reasonable, it should at least solve the housing problem for these poor civil servants who have returned at this time. The third and fourth provisions of the Executive Yuan's measures stipulate that the houses inhabited by enemy aliens, but not owned by enemies or collaborators, will be leased uniformly by the Central Trust Bureau to meet the urgent needs of repatriation and will be preferentially subleased to agencies and civil servants returning to Shanghai for a period of one year. Tenants must sign a contract and pay the stipulated rent monthly. If this can indeed be done, then of the 7,960 houses left behind by more than 90,000 enemy aliens, except for the 2,099 houses owned by enemies or collaborators, which should be sold by the government, the remaining 5,800-plus houses can be preferentially subleased to agencies and civil servants who need housing, to prevent them from competing with ordinary citizens for other housing and exacerbating the housing crisis, and to prevent them from not being able to rent housing and simply crying in vain.

Second, some may think that this approach infringes upon the rights and interests of the original owners. In fact, if we analyze the so-called "rights and interests," they are nothing more than the right to reside and the right to lease. Because we absolutely do not allow any owners to neither live in nor rent out their houses today! If so, then for these five to six thousand houses, except for the very few that can prove that the owners genuinely live in them themselves or a fair solution should be decided upon, the rest, which are owned by real estate companies, are nothing more than rentals. Then, if they are all rentals, why can't they be rented to the government? Today, the government is uniformly leasing them to meet the urgent needs of repatriation and is signing contracts to pay rent, only for a period of one year, with a guarantee to vacate upon expiration, without extension or transfer, and those who violate this will be ordered to move out (original measure third). Moreover, those who reside in the aforementioned houses without approval will be given a deadline to move out (original measure fifth). In terms of reason and principle, the rental rights of the original owners have been fully guaranteed, and there is no question of infringement. If it is said that the owners have already leased to tenants in advance, then this approach may have the suspicion of breaking private contracts. Then we should ask: if the original owners rented to enemy aliens in the past, should the contract continue to be valid after the enemy aliens return to their country? If they were forcibly occupied by enemy aliens or deliberately allowed them to live in them to curry favor with the enemy, now that the country has won the war and the government has repatriated the enemy aliens, if the government designates agencies to sign leases with the owners, what contracts are being broken? As for if it is said that some houses have recently been leased to new tenants by the owners and cannot be disregarded, then may we ask: before the enemy aliens were being repatriated and the houses had not yet been returned to the owners by the government, did the owners have the right to independently rent them out without regard to the current needs of the government? In other words, does the country winning the war and the government sealing up the houses create the only opportunity for these few owners to collect large amounts of gold bars (key money) for recovering their houses? Impartially speaking, we believe that if the government uniformly leases the houses, as long as it can be sure to set a fixed term, pay reasonable rent, and guarantee to vacate within a certain period of time, there is no reason for the owners to refuse to hand them over under the pretext of rights and interests.

(3) Currently, the most incomprehensible thing in the Shanghai housing crisis is the alarming amount of key money and small rents, which the government seems to have ignored in the past. Today, those who have no houses to live in are indeed pitiful, but the benefits of the real owners who have built houses are not as good as those of the second landlords who wildly demand key money and the rent collectors who wantonly demand small rents. Today, there is almost no market for buying and selling real estate in Shanghai; only the trading of key money, and the price of gold bars for key money is almost the same as the cost of buying property. Owners rent to tenants, and over the years, they don't know how many names have changed, but the owners still have no right to ask. The rent collected by the owners from their tenants may only be dozens or even one or two hundred times more than before the war, but what the tenants transfer to others or extort from third tenants is often ten or one hundred times more than the rent they pay. When the lease term of the tenant expires, the owner has no right to take back the house and re-rent it, but can only watch helplessly as the tenant has a huge income due to the key money; there is even a joke that the owner really needs to live in the house himself but has to pay the tenant key money, which is equivalent to redeeming the house. Under this situation, naturally no one is willing to invest in building houses for rent, inviting trouble. Thus, the housing crisis will inevitably be permanently serious. Whether the measures stipulated by the Executive Yuan this time are good or not, we will not discuss them for the time being, but in terms of stipulating a one-year term, with a guarantee to vacate upon expiration, without extension or transfer, if it can be earnestly implemented, it can indeed open a new era for breaking the bad practices of key money and small rents. Thinking for the general owners, instead of just blaming the government's uniform leasing, it is better to strengthen the demand that the government strictly implement the third provision of the measures. Because as long as the houses can be recovered as scheduled after being rented out, and as long as the government can continue to handle general housing rental disputes according to this policy in the future, not only will the rights and interests of the owners be effectively protected, but also the illegal gains of the middleman exploiters of key money and small rents will be eliminated, which will also be of great benefit to the general tenants who rent houses normally.

However, "laws cannot enforce themselves." We cannot solve the housing crisis in Shanghai solely by relying on this single set of measures from the Executive Yuan; we also need "people" to implement the measures. If people are not just, all good laws and good intentions will deteriorate! Moreover, this method is naturally not a fundamental solution to the housing crisis. However, we must also think for the government, think for the general poor civil servants, and think for the general owners whose houses have been forcibly occupied by unscrupulous people, who have no income and who have been constantly appealing without success. In this time and place, to solve the local housing crisis, we can only try this method first.

### Correspondences from Various Locations

Suzhou

The Chief of the Tax Office Imprisoned for Embezzling Tax Revenue

Tao Jieyu, the 28-year-old chief of the Hengjing District Collection Branch of the Wuxian Autonomous Tax Bureau, embezzled 177,168.68 yuan in tax revenue during his tenure and illegally printed 171 license certificates. After being discovered by the general office, he was reported to the county government. The county arrested Tao and sent him to the Procuratorate of the District Court. After investigation and prosecution, the District Court sentenced him to three years and six months of imprisonment, deprived him of his civil rights for three years, and recovered the tax revenue.

Changshu

The Provisional Consultative Council Exposes Fake Secret Agents

At the second meeting of the County Provisional Consultative Council on the morning of the 10th, councilors stated that Deng Yongnian, a fake secret agent, and Leng Yimin (alias Shen Bairu), a translator for the enemy's constitutional police, had infiltrated the Changshu Disciplinary Team of the Beijing-Shanghai Garrison Command's Pacification Supervision Group, where they indiscriminately arrested people and subjected them to torture and beatings. The councilors demanded that the team be withdrawn. According to the report of County Magistrate An Weinan, Deng Yongnian had been arrested by the county government after being accused by the people, but was subsequently taken away by the team. It was found that there were as many as five enemy constitutional police translators and fake secret agents mixed in the team. After discussion, it was resolved to telegraph the Garrison Command to severely punish them.

Wuxi

A Tragedy of a Hand Grenade Explosion

On the 11th, in Yanghua Village near Xueyanqiao Town on the border of Xiwu, the "Great Master" temple was consecrated. In addition to holding a incense festival, a local opera troupe was hired to perform in the village. The theater was crowded with people, no less than two or three thousand. During a tense moment, a hand grenade suddenly flew into the theater, causing a loud explosion and a complete chaos throughout the theater. Five people, including Yang Arong, were killed on the spot, and 29 people were injured. They were successively sent to Wuxi to be treated in hospitals such as the Brothers and Puren Hospitals.

Jiaxing

Preventing Black Market Distribution of Silkworm Eggs

A large number of silkworm eggs, totaling more than 30,000 sheets, have been transported to Jiaxing. The township offices have submitted lists of households to order them. The two rearing households in Wangdian and Zhenru have the most, so they are also allocated the most. In order to take care of the rearing households before the Anti-Japanese War, those who hold the debt receipts for selling autumn silkworm cocoons from the 26th year of the former Silkworm Silk Control Association can order them first. In order to prevent people from manipulating prices in the market (the original price was 2,000 yuan per sheet) and selling on the black market, the local China Silkworm Silk Company has formulated a method for receiving silkworm eggs to prevent malpractices.

Hangzhou

Traitor Xu Pucheng Arrested and Escorted to Hangzhou

The notorious traitor Xu Pucheng, who roamed the areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, held important positions such as commander of the puppet army. After the victory, he hid in Shanghai. Xu dared to secretly go to Jiaxing to take care of his properties in the Jiahu area, and was discovered by detectives and quickly arrested, then escorted to Hangzhou for interrogation.

Published Based on Incoming Letters

To the Editor-in-Chief of Shen Bao,

Respectfully, I am writing to inform you that the news published in the Shanghai and Wuxi newspapers on March 21 about the railway police in Wuxi brutally beating news vendors is not consistent with the facts. Our office is responsible for the management of railway police affairs and the maintenance of order at stations and on trains. On March 20, the railway police stationed at Wuxi Station cracked down on unlicensed vendors entering the station, which was carried out in accordance with railway regulations and was the duty of the railway police. However, the news vendor failed to understand and did not abide by the regulations. The station's patrol officer was also inadequate in his response, and the garrison's military police mistakenly overstepped their authority by transferring Song Yousheng, a police officer in active service in our office, to the judicial authorities, resulting in a dispute. After mutual clarification of the truth, the matter has been resolved. The so-called "bayonet injuries" are purely fictitious. In order to avoid confusion and misrepresentation, we are writing to request that your newspaper publish this letter to clarify the facts.

Respectfully,
The Police Department of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration.

### Implementation of the Food Rationing System: Many Issues Still Need to be Considered; Related Parties Express: We Dare Not Take Risks by Experimenting with the Current Domestic Situation

[Our Newspaper's Report] This reporter recently inquired about the suggestion from foreign parties that the city urgently needs to implement a food rationing and effective control program, from the related parties. It is said that the government has long considered a food rationing case. However, after research, it is believed that there are both advantages and disadvantages. Considering the situation in China two years ago, we dare not risk attempting it. The reasons for the difficulties are: (1) There has never been a precise population count of Chinese cities; even if there is one, the quantity is mostly inaccurate, not to mention the quality. (2) The implementation of a rationing system must be carried out on a ground-wide basis, to avoid people from crowding into the rationing area, causing the population of the rationing area to expand. In addition, consideration must be given to rationing goods, because since food is rationed, there are other items to be rationed everywhere, so why only food? (3) The government must hold enough rationed grain for several months of consumption and must maintain a continuous supply of large quantities of rice, which will invisibly eliminate all existing grain merchants. (4) It is difficult to determine the price of rationed grain. If it is too high, the people will not want it, and if it is too low, it will cause a phenomenon of crowding into the rationing area to compete for purchases. (5) Due to the overall rationing, the price of grain in the rural producing areas, after continuous large-scale purchases, will be higher than the price of grain in the cities. (6) The unemployed and parasites must also be rationed. Therefore, considering the above reasons, it is believed that the implementation of the food rationing system in our country may not achieve the expected results, and accumulated abuses will arise as a result.

At about 10 pm the night before, Li picked up a passenger on Beijing Road and drove them to the Carlton Apartment on Baker Road. When they arrived at the door, two people jumped on the car and ordered him to drive to the vicinity of Xiaonanmen in Nanshi. When they arrived there, two more people got into the car one after another. One of the robbers showed a hand-made gun, handcuffed Li's hands, and told him not to make a sound. They robbed him of more than 60,000 yuan in legal tender and a watch from his pocket. One of the robbers drove the car away. When they arrived at the intersection of Dinghai Road in Yangshupu, they drove Gennan out of the car and drove away.

The highest tram fare will be 120 yuan and 200 yuan. The highest bus fare will be 300 yuan, approximately double the original price. It is currently undecided whether the public buses operated by the Bureau of Public Utilities will also increase fares simultaneously.

### Shanghai Residents Turn Pale at the Mention of "Housing" - Can the Housing Crisis Be Resolved? - Investing in Building New Houses is Not Worthwhile - The Distribution of Vacant Houses Left by the Enemy and Puppets is Not Entirely Reasonable

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] The housing crisis in this city did not begin today, but it is now more severe than ever. The recent intense debate in the Municipal Provisional Council regarding the issue of rent increases, the heated competition for vacant houses left behind after the large-scale withdrawal of Japanese residents, the ever-increasing number of housing cases handled by the Housing Rental Management Committee, the promulgation of emergency measures by the Executive Yuan to allocate housing for various agencies in Shanghai... all fully expose the severity of the housing crisis. The reporter wanted to explore a solution to this problem and interviewed various parties involved, obtaining the following fragmented information.

Building New Houses

One Hundred Percent Unfavorable

The most fundamental solution to the housing crisis is to build a large number of new houses. However, given the current situation, the conditions for building houses are one hundred percent unfavorable. The most immediate obstacle to building new houses, according to general opinion, is that it is not profitable. Construction costs are too high, and the returns are too low. The dream of those who own real estate, to use rental income as a profitable business, has long passed. On the contrary, they only feel that owning real estate has increased their burden. For many houses, due to the limited rent and the high expenses of various taxes and management fees, landlords often find themselves losing money. Selling them? Direct tax regulations stipulate that 50% of the income from the sale of real estate exceeding two million yuan must be taxed as property sale income. Landlords inevitably have a feeling of being able to see, but not reach, the natural appreciation of real estate. Furthermore, the inheritance tax rate is also quite high. Therefore, some people are shouting that the current damage tax rate is too high, which also hinders the birth of new houses.

Regarding the supply of building materials, according to experts, the situation is not extremely serious. However, the eight years of the war of resistance greatly reduced the number of skilled workers. Many carpenters and masons did not take apprentices during those eight years, and many changed careers. It is inevitable that there will be a shortage of manpower to build a large number of new houses. As for the vacant land for building houses, it is of course extremely scarce in the bustling city center, and in the suburban areas, building permits cannot be issued due to the municipal government's plan to determine new road routes. Even if there are permits, they are for temporary buildings. Moreover, the lengthy process of transferring deeds and exchanging certificates at the Land Administration Bureau has caused deed holders to hesitate, and according to regulations, they are not allowed to build houses before obtaining formal land ownership.

There Were Plans

But They Ultimately Could Not Be Realized

The municipal government also had plans to build houses. It is said that as far back as November of last year, it had already drafted a plan to build three thousand affordable housing units. The initial estimated cost was 200 billion yuan in legal tender. This plan was presented to the financial sector to discuss funding for building houses, but the result was that the low interest rates, large amounts, and long periods did not arouse the interest of the financial sector in investing. Because of repeated delays, the originally estimated cost has now risen to 1 trillion yuan. Where can this huge amount of funding be found? Taking a step back and requesting building materials from the "United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" (UNRRA), they said that only cities with more than 50% destruction can enjoy the right to be allocated building materials. This hope was also invisibly extinguished. The Central Trust Bureau also had plans to sell all the enemy and puppet real estate it had taken over, and use the proceeds to build a large number of reconstruction houses. However, based on the current situation, the fate of this plan has long been shelved!

Robbing Peter to Pay Paul

A Blessing or a Curse?

In the midst of hopelessness regarding the addition of new houses, the vacant houses left behind after the withdrawal of Japanese residents have naturally become the target of competition from all sides. As a result, there are many complaints: some criticizing the illegality of those who occupy houses, others criticizing the improper handling by the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau. Finally, a temporary answer was obtained with the seven measures for allocating housing for various agencies in Shanghai, which were stipulated by the Executive Yuan the day before yesterday. The Executive Yuan clearly saw the complexity of dealing with enemy and puppet residential houses and stipulated that the final handling power should be determined by the Executive Yuan to solve the problem in a coordinated manner. This measure is a blessing for agencies and civil servants returning to Shanghai. However, it is inevitable that some who have already legally obtained leases from landlords, and those who are continuing to rent as original residents, will feel regret at being overlooked. The tenants in the Hongkou Kulun Road area have already launched a petition because they have been ordered to move. It can be imagined that similar cases will inevitably continue to emerge. Therefore, there are calls hoping that the Executive Yuan can have some remedial measures in addition to this emergency measure. Of course, the original intention of the measure is good. However, it is inevitable to rob Peter to pay Paul. For example, the rental law often becomes a talisman for tenants to occupy houses forever. Is this the original intention of the legislators?

Addressing the Root Cause and the Symptoms

Overall, Fairness and Reasonableness are Expected

It is estimated that the destruction rate of houses in this city during the war was only 15% to 20%. The most affected areas were the Nanshi and Zhabei districts. According to the latest estimates from the municipal government, the population of this city is only over 3.3 million, which has not increased compared to the pre-war period. Therefore, the symptomatic solution to the housing crisis is to make more efforts in the allocation of resources. A reasonable allocation of enemy and puppet residential houses is only the beginning of the entire allocation plan. Some people suggest whether it is possible to follow the example of the Paris municipal government in France, investigate vacant houses, or houses with extra rooms, and impose extremely heavy vacant house taxes until the owners rent them out. In terms of addressing the root cause, it is also necessary to add new houses and order a large number of mobile homes from abroad. In a situation where people are unwilling to invest, the government should find ways to organize marketing cooperatives to coordinate the purchase and transportation of various building materials. To raise funds, it may be possible to issue a construction bond and designate the relevant businesses to share the amortization equally. This is a matter of public welfare, and all relevant parties should contribute their share of strength to achieve the effect of everyone working together to overcome difficulties, and success will come naturally!

### Wang Zhengting Talks After Arriving in Shanghai - Lamenting the Extravagance and Luxury of Shanghai Residents - Hoping that the Authorities Will Promote Modern Education

Wang Zhengting, who served as China's ambassador to the United States and the chairman of the Post-War Enemy Crimes Investigation Committee, recently traveled from Chongqing to Hong Kong and then to Shanghai. He will soon be traveling by ship to the Philippines. Yesterday morning, Mr. Wang received reporters at his private residence and stated that his trip to the Philippines was entirely a private action, in his capacity as the chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank of Communications in Manila (the Bank of Communications in Manila is registered with the Philippine government and is not a branch of our Bank of Communications), to attend the shareholders' meeting of the bank. After the meeting, he must go to the United States for a short stay. When reporters asked Mr. Wang about his future interest in politics, he said: "The country is based on the people. When the foundation is established, the path will be born. When the foundation is solid, the country will be prosperous. Every citizen should bear more responsibility and fulfill more obligations to the country. We should start from scratch, from small to large. Looking at the public works in European countries, they are all managed by the people themselves, without relying on or shirking responsibility to the government. Sun Yat-sen also emphasized local self-governance, which is a clear example." Regarding the timing of China's entry into the path of democracy, Mr. Wang said that democracy belongs to the people and is based on the people. Of course, it is particularly important to support public opinion and pay close attention to people's lives in order to promote and develop the Principle of People's Livelihood, so that people can live and work in peace, and all kinds of pessimistic shadows can be completely eliminated. Mr. Wang concluded by saying: "The general people of Shanghai seem to enjoy luxury and are enthusiastic about speculation. A small number of young people are not using what they have learned and are easily tempted by profit, creating a talent panic phenomenon. I hope the authorities will promote modern education and strengthen the training of specialized talents to engage in nation-building and self-reliance, so that the new China can advance shoulder to shoulder with the advanced democratic countries of the world and ascend to the hall of democracy together."

### City Buses - Once United in Stopping Operations

Originating from an Assault on a Ticket Seller

[Report from Our Newspaper] At approximately 12:30 noon yesterday, a bus of the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, traveling to the Zhongzheng East Road station, had a group of soldiers who wanted to board the bus. For some unknown reason, they suddenly had a quarrel with the ticket seller, and the ticket seller was beaten, causing a dispute.

### A Glimpse of the Work of the Dredging Bureau - Mud Dredging Gradually Improves - Lack of Tugs Affects the Entire Work Plan

[Report from Our Newspaper] The reporter recently visited Mr. Shi Konghuai, Director of the Dredging Bureau, who informed us that due to eight years of occupation, the Huangpu River in this city had not been dredged, and the waterway was silted up, making it difficult for large ships to navigate. The shipping industry is currently suffering from three main problems: (1) The wharf beaches are shallow due to years of neglect, making it difficult for large ships to load and unload; (2) Wharf warehouses along the riverbank are piled up with enemy and puppet materials, and there is nowhere to store imported goods; (3) Better wharves have been requisitioned by the US military, so there is an extreme shortage of wharves. He also stated that before the war, the Dredging Bureau had more than 70 vessels, including dredgers and tugboats. Only 30 vessels were received after the victory, and now there are more than 50 vessels. Before the war, there were 16 dredgers, but now there are only eight, and only five of them are usable, and three need to be repaired. Before the war, there were 14 tugboats, but now there are only five. Before the war, there were 26 mud barges, but now there are 24, and eight of them are unusable. Since receiving the property in mid-September last year, the Dredging Bureau has resumed dredging work on the Huangpu River. Before the war, an average of 250,000 tons of mud and sand were dredged each month. From September 17 to the end of September last year, the Dredging Bureau dredged 10,000 tons of mud. In October, it was over 20,000 tons, in November 30,000 tons, in December 40,000 tons, in January 50,000 tons, in February 60,000 tons, and in March 80,000 tons. It is expected that the target will increase to 100,000 tons this month. From the above figures, it can be seen that the Dredging Bureau is constantly improving. According to Director Shi, based on the current efficiency of the dredgers, 180,000 tons of mud can be dredged each month. However, the lack of tugboats prevents the entire work plan from being fully developed.

### Truck Destroys House

Commercial News

### Commodity Prices Show Signs of Weakness Last Week - Securities Speculation Remains Hot

The factories in this city have gradually resumed production, the supply of materials is gradually becoming plentiful, and foreign materials are also arriving continuously. The situation of supply and demand imbalance during the war has gradually disappeared. The golden age for speculators has passed. Although the prices of goods have been hovering at their peak recently, it will be difficult to sustain in the long run. Once domestic and foreign transportation is smooth and import and export materials are smooth, and commercial competition begins, the future of commodity prices will have major changes. The following is a summary of the commercial and financial situation last week:

Gold: Rumors have been circulating last week, which have created opportunities for speculators to take advantage of. The Central Bank's allocation price remains unchanged at 1.6 million yuan. Very few people have applied to the gold industry. The black market has been lower than the official price. At the beginning of the week, it opened at 1.47 million, and on Tuesday it was even lower at 1.38 million. However, there were buyers at low prices, and the market was able to maintain its position. On Wednesday and Thursday, it hovered between 1.42 million and 1.46 million. On Friday, the Central Bank and securities firms frequently absorbed gold, and the price rose from 1.47 million to 1.56 million. The trend was even more favorable on Saturday, once breaking through 1.63 million, and closing at 1.605 million.

Foreign Currency: Because the Central Bank's exchange rate of 2020 yuan for the US dollar has remained unchanged, transactions have been slow. From Monday to Thursday, it hovered between 1878 and 1880. On Friday, due to rumors of a relaxation of foreign exchange, the market situation changed, and the buying trend suddenly became strong. The price rose from 1910 to 1970. On Saturday, it once broke through the 2,000 yuan mark, closing at 2,040, exceeding the Central Bank's supply price for the US dollar. Since the Hong Kong dollar has been leveled between new and old goods, there is no more waves to be made. The rise and fall throughout the week was only about 10 or 20 yuan.

Government Bonds: The trend of the unified government bonds was most promising on Tuesday and Wednesday of the entire week, due to the stimulation of rumors of principal repayment. On Tuesday, amid rumors of interest buying, the price once hovered inside and outside the 5,000 yuan mark, closing at 4,850 yuan. The rest all saw an increase. On Wednesday, the competition between buyers and sellers was very fierce, and the market trend was tortuous, creating a new high price of 5,120 yuan several times. However, retail investors took advantage of the high price to sell, pushing the price down by 100 yuan. From Thursday to Saturday, short sellers rose up, and the price gradually moved downstream. The final price of Type C fell to 4,320 yuan, Type A and B saw 2,100 yuan, Type D saw 2,150, and Type E saw 2,350.

Stocks: At the beginning of the week, Hong Kong stocks all fell amid a pervasive selling atmosphere. New Guang's depreciation was significant, and foreign stocks also trended downstream. The next morning, Hong Kong stocks were still weak, but in the afternoon, due to the influx of hot money, the downward trend was slightly reduced. Foreign stocks were bought one after another and turned firm. However, Jardine Matheson alone lagged behind. On Wednesday, Hong Kong stocks had many twists and turns. As a result, three popular stocks rose slightly, while the rest were average. Foreign stocks were sold one after another, resulting in a decline. On Thursday, Hong Kong stocks initially showed a hovering state, but in the end, due to the loosening of credit, the buying trend resumed, and prices rose across the board. Foreign stocks were excited and buying was strong. Hong Kong and Shanghai Hotels rose even more. On Friday, due to the rise in the price of gold, morale was boosted, and the market momentum of Hong Kong stocks suddenly flourished. Foreign stocks rose together. At the weekend, Hong Kong stocks were initially favorable and then tired. As a result, each fell by about half a percent. Foreign stocks continued to rise. Jardine Matheson called out 13,500 yuan, Ewo almost broke the 6,000 yuan mark, and Asia also rose by more than 10%.

Raw Yarn: In the past week, initially due to the sluggishness of gold and stocks, the Shanghai raw yarn market was flooded with inventory. The actual sales of major customers such as Guangdong and Hubei were weak, and bulls were uneasy and closed out in large quantities. Short sellers took advantage of the situation to put pressure on prices. On Tuesday, 20-count special double horses reached a low point of 950,000, and warehouse receipts were as low as 920,000. Then, due to the excessive drop in prices in the past two days, gold rose again, and the current sales of customers turned for the better, causing retail short sellers to make profits and cover their positions, and prices slowly recovered. In addition to special double horses, which fell by 90,000 compared to the previous Saturday, the prices of other yarns fell by 50,000 to 60,000.

Cloth Market: Customers and door shops still have no large purchases, but the market price has fallen to the bottom, so the market situation has not changed much during the week. As a result, the situation was mediocre compared to the previous Saturday.

Cotton Market: The actual purchases of manufacturers are poor, and the transactions between the same industries are still lively. However, because there is a source of foreign cotton from time to time, and manufacturers are increasingly waiting and seeing, the market is difficult to revitalize, and it has fallen by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan compared to the previous Saturday.

Rice and Grain: Rice prices rose little last week due to the abundant supply of goods, and the situation was relatively stable. Edible oil continued downstream, and only stopped falling and turned upward after Thursday. Due to the continued auction of enemy and puppet properties by the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau, the situation for sugar deteriorated. Flour was average, and miscellaneous grains rose and fell mixed.

### Comments from Industry Insiders - The Reason for the Decline of Cotton Yarn and Cloth - Increased Production, but Sales Cannot Keep Up

[Report from Our Newspaper] Recently, the cotton yarn and cloth market has changed from enthusiastic to indifferent. Industry insiders have discussed the reasons for the sluggish market, as follows: (1) At the end of last year, due to the manufacture of military uniforms, a large number of cloth was handled, and speculators generally expected that the market would definitely rise, so they searched for and purchased it. At this time, the amount of goods received was not strong, and the spot goods were thin, and there was not enough to meet the market at one time. The market price of cotton yarn and cloth rose in a straight line, and all cotton yarn and cloth merchants made a lot of profit and were very happy. (2) Unexpectedly, the price was high, and the demand shrank. The markets in all regions formed an upside-down situation. The market price of grey cloth in Qingdao, Jinan, and Yantai was even cheaper than that in Shanghai. Not only could Shanghai goods not go there, but the goods from that place were also shipped to Shanghai. As for Hankou, Sichuan, and other places, the market price was also not good. Therefore, traffickers stopped moving forward. However, Guangzhou's commerce was more prosperous, and cotton yarn and cloth could still make a profit when transported there. However, there was a lack of ships. If a large number of goods arrived in Guangdong, the market would also be affected. (3) Since the opening of the foreign exchange market, the trend has been stable, the import of American cotton has been enthusiastic, and the price is quite cheap. With this sufficient raw material, the factory is working hard to resume production, working day and night, so that materials have increased. The cotton yarn and cloth of state-owned and private enterprises are also opening up as much as possible. The long-term withered market has sufficient chips, and those who hoard and store goods are cautious. The market situation of cotton yarn and cloth is slowing down. (4) At the beginning of this year's spring, the China Textile Construction Corporation opened sales dates for cotton yarn and cloth. Cloth merchants and yarn shops were eager to crowd. More than 400 companies registered for cotton yarn, and more than 1,400 companies registered for cotton cloth. Now it is very different from the past. Recently, the market price of commodities has been rising due to rumors, but cotton yarn and cloth are still calm. After the prosperity and disgrace of the market, we should think about the supply and demand, not just the speculation. The following are the high and low prices of cotton yarn and cloth since March:

### Raincoat Materials - Three Changes

Post-War - Defense Emerges

[Report from Our Newspaper] The manufacture of raincoats began around the first year of the Republic of China and gradually expanded thereafter. The earliest customers were the Qingdao and Hankou groups. At that time, the materials were all British-made double-sided open-water taste and single-sided open-water taste, double-sided yarn and single-sided yarn, ordinary stripes and mercerized stripes, etc. There were only a few colors, such as navy blue, blue-gray, and yellow-gray. In the tenth year of the Republic of China, due to the increase in the urban population, the demand became more and more prosperous. The new colors of imported goods included thin-skinned elephant skin lining, such as blue, red, purple, green, yuan, navy, gray, yellow, cyan, plaid, and polka dots, etc. Women's raincoats became more popular. Ordinary stripes and mercerized stripes were all eliminated. At this time, there were specialized stores that made raincoat materials, including Hui Kang, Yi Kang, Chang Ji, Heng Yuan, Rong Changde, etc. Around the twentieth year of the Republic of China, there was another change. The sales of this group increased day by day. Among the Western goods that arrived were Bao Bielin, and among the Eastern goods that arrived in Shanghai for dumping were yarn surface and thin suede leather paint, etc. The goods from the past, except for the single-sided open-water taste, which was still popular, were gradually eliminated. In the twenty-eighth year of the Republic of China, there was a third change. Due to the outbreak of war between China and foreign countries, the arrival of imported goods disappeared, and the inventory in this port was sold out one after another. All kinds of raincoat materials were mostly out of stock, but the public still needed them, so Chinese people researched and invented rubber yarn raincoat cloth. However, due to raw materials and environmental relations, it soon stopped again. The rain-proof cloth that is widely sold today came into being at this time. Whether it is Chinese or Western raincoats, they all flock to it. It is popular throughout Shanghai and the Beijing-Hangzhou area. The manufacturers of rain-proof cloth that are famous are Yousheng, Da Ming, Da Chang, Da Gong, Shuang Lu, etc. The raincoat manufacturers that are famous are Rong Changde Flying Dragon Brand, Xiang Sheng Shuang Ma Brand, and Shanghai's Elephant Brand. Yongxin Ai Di Kai was also well-known at first, but now it has been reduced in color because Da Chang does not supply cloth. In addition, there are also Meilun Guangming spun silk glass raincoats, which are popular among women for their light weight, low price, and beauty, and their sales are also wide.

### Universities in the Nine Northeastern Provinces Systematically Being Taken Over and Reorganized

[Dahua News Agency, Shenyang] Universities in the nine northeastern provinces are being systematically taken over. Northeastern University has moved back to Shenyang. In addition to the original College of Liberal Arts and College of Science, the Fengtian Industrial University of the puppet Manchukuo period will be merged into the College of Engineering, and the private Fengtian Business College will be renamed the College of Law and Commerce. The newly established Changchun University, in addition to establishing its own College of Liberal Arts and College of Science, will also merge the Xinjing College of Law and Politics of the puppet Manchukuo era into the new College of Law and Commerce, the Xinjing Industrial University into the College of Engineering, the Xinjing Livestock and Veterinary University into the College of Agriculture, and the Xinjing Medical University into the College of Medicine. Binjiang University, in addition to its own College of Liberal Arts and College of Science, will also merge the Harbin College of the puppet Manchukuo era into the College of Commerce, the Harbin Agricultural University into the College of Agriculture, the Harbin Industrial University into the College of Engineering, and the Harbin Medical University into the College of Medicine. Other universities, such as the Shidao University and Shizhe College of the puppet Manchukuo era, will be merged and reorganized into the National Northeast Normal College. The Xinjing Shidao University will be reorganized into the National Northeast Women's Normal College, and the Xing'an Medical College will be reorganized into the National Xing'an Medical College. As for the Jiamusi Medical College, the Bei'an Reclamation Medical College, and the Changjing Reclamation Hospital, because they were all established by the Japanese, they have now been closed. The Beiman College, established by the Russians, is now divided into two departments: industry and commerce. The Shengjing Medical University, established by the church, has a high reputation and is allowed to be established as a private college. In addition, the Continental Scientific Institute, established by the enemy and puppet regime, is large in scale and perfectly equipped, and has now been taken over by the Academia Sinica and the Northeast Education Guidance Committee.

### Private Schools Collecting Fees for a Second Time

The Federation of Primary and Secondary Schools Issues a Statement

[Our Newspaper] Mr. Jiang Jizhou, the person in charge of the Federation of Private Primary and Secondary Schools in this city, made the following statement to our newspaper reporter regarding the second fee collection by private schools:

Fee Standards

The fee amounts for private primary and secondary schools in this city for this semester were determined in January of this year, with reference to the treatment of teachers in city schools, using a monthly salary of 16,000 yuan for primary school teachers and 44,000 yuan for secondary school teachers as the standard. At that time, the cost of living index was 520 times that of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), but when the schools began collecting fees, the cost of living index had already risen to more than 1,800 times, and now it has exceeded 2,000 times. Under the threat of extreme poverty, more than 8,000 teachers in the city's schools urgently need relief. The main countermeasures, such as expanding the education budget and determining subsidies for private schools, are what teachers unanimously hope for, and the Provisional Council has also made the same resolution. However, it is feared that this plan will be difficult to implement this semester. As for the Teacher Appreciation Donation, the intention is very good, but the amount of money needed by private schools is too large, and it is a drop in the bucket.

Principles of Continued Collection

Therefore, after repeated discussions, and in a meeting convened by the Director of Education, the following decisions were made: (1) Each school may collect tuition fees once more, and the amount shall not exceed the miscellaneous fees collected by each school last time in principle, but no more than 12,000 yuan for primary schools, no more than 16,000 yuan for junior high schools, and no more than 20,000 yuan for senior high schools. (2) Students from poor families should have their tuition fees reduced or waived, and the number of free places in each school should not be less than 20%. (3) In addition to the necessary expenses of each school, all the tuition fees collected shall be used as teachers' salaries in principle. It is verified that teachers in private schools in this city have never neglected their studies for a single day under any hardship. This noble educational spirit should be appreciated by all parents, who will be happy to provide financial assistance.

### 100 Free Primary Schools Plan

Announced by the Tianjin Relief Branch

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 13th] In order to benefit out-of-school children from poor families, the local relief branch announced a plan for 100 free primary schools, with each school also establishing a milk station to provide milk for impoverished children in need.

Yesterday, they jointly appealed to the Municipal Education Bureau to forward their appeal to the Municipal Government and the Aviation Committee and other agencies to take effective measures and order the factory to evacuate as soon as possible.

### Zhejiang University Once Went on Strike Demanding the School Increase Professors' Salaries

(Our Newspaper, Hangzhou) The salaries of faculty and staff at National Zhejiang University were recently only 20,000 yuan in basic living allowance, plus a coefficient of 70 times that amount. At a time when prices are rising sharply, it is difficult to maintain a livelihood. The entire faculty and staff of the school discussed the issue of requesting improved treatment at Luoyuan in West Lake (the site of the school's normal college) the night before last, and resolved to take steps. It was decided that, in addition to sending a telegram to Principal Zhu at the Zunyi Main Campus, urging the Ministry of Education to quickly improve the treatment of the faculty and staff of Zhejiang University, the school should increase the treatment proportionally to the cost of living index and quickly allocate arrears. On the 11th, a three-day school-wide strike was implemented. Lu Jina, the person in charge of the school in Hangzhou, in order to take into account the students' studies, invited all faculty and staff to a symposium in the school's conference room on Daxue Road, expressing that the salaries owed to the faculty and staff would be temporarily advanced from the repatriation funds, and asked them to take into account the students' studies and immediately resume classes. As for the request to increase treatment and improve living conditions, the school would negotiate with the Ministry of Education and then resolve the matter. The faculty and staff, believing that the various requests had yielded concrete results, resumed classes in the afternoon and awaited the Ministry of Education's response. (Butterfly)

### Qingbai Beats Jewish 6-0; Donghua Beats Italian Overseas Chinese 4-0, Each Wins Right to Mayor's Cup Soccer Final; The Battle Between Yiyuan and Dongyi Almost Ended Unpleasantly

Yesterday, the Mayor's Cup soccer semi-finals were held in Jiaoyuan in the morning and Yiyuan in the afternoon. Both games were opened in cold weather, and the audience was not as crowded as expected. The Qing-Jewish match in the morning was quite sparsely attended. The results of the two games were Qingbai winning Jewish 6-0. Jewish players Fu En and Olivelia did not play, weakening their strength considerably. Donghua defeated Italian Overseas Chinese 4-0. After Chen Mingzhe broke into the empty net in the 15th minute of the second half, the Italian Overseas Chinese believed that Han Longhai had touched the ball with his hand earlier, but the referee ruled the goal valid. The Italian players were angry and implemented a strike-like soccer game, allowing Donghua to score at will. Donghua then scored two more goals.

Defeated Jewish

Qingbai still used the lineup from the match against Donghua yesterday, determined to win. Not only did the Jewish team fail to bring in the star player, but Fu En and Olivelia also failed to appear, making their defeat inevitable. After the start, there was a melee for a long time. Di Ting broke through on the left, and Little Gu scored the first goal. Soon after, Qiu Ting crossed again, and A Kui scored from 25 yards, resulting in another goal. The score was 2-0 at halftime. Although the Jewish team tried to recover in the second half, their strength was not as good as Qingbai's, and the Qingbai defenders did not allow any gaps. In the 10th minute, Qiu Ting hooked the ball from the left side, and it actually went directly into the net. Fei Chunhua made a wonderful cut on the right, and Lazy Niu headed the ball, sending it into the net, making the score 4-0. At this time, Qingbai was completely in control. Little Fei actually scored two goals in the last 10 minutes, and Qingbai won Jewish 6-0.

Defeated Italian Overseas Chinese

Donghua did not have A Dai Youren play yesterday, so Longhai was in the center, and Youliang assisted him. Mingzhe was on the right wing, and the position of Youren was tried by veteran Xin Quan, which was also an ideal change. Donghua took the offensive as soon as the game started, but it was not successful. The Italian Overseas Chinese counterattacked, and the game was in a seesaw situation. At the end of the first half, both sides did not score. The battle became more intense in the second half, and there were many highlights. In the 15th minute, Li Yao crossed from the left, Longhai rushed up and met with McNiti. The goal was empty, and Mingzhe rushed up and pushed the ball into the net. The Italian Overseas Chinese believed that Longhai had used his hand to hit the ball and could not accept the goal. However, referee Chen Jixiang ruled it valid. The Italian players then left the field together. Fortunately, the Standing Committee and Qu Yaokang explained, and they re-entered the field to play. However, the Italian Overseas Chinese actually played a strike-like soccer game and coped casually. Before long, Li Yao scored a goal, and Han Longhai scored twice, ending the game hastily. Donghua won Italian Overseas Chinese 4-0. This spirit of the Italian Overseas Chinese players is really not a good example and is deeply regrettable.

### "Guangzhou's Spring is Warmer than Tokyo's" - An Interview with Japanese War Criminal Tanaka Hisaichi

— Guangzhou, 5th (Airmail) Our Special Correspondent, Liang Feng

A slightly faded blue sedan carried the reporter through the bustling crowds! It crossed the majestic Haizhu Iron Bridge, reached Henan, and gradually departed the noisy city, hurrying towards our destination - the Japanese War Criminal Detention Center.

It was during the Qingming Festival in the late spring of March, but the climate in the South was as sultry as high summer. However, the reporter's mood remained endlessly excited because today, with the enthusiastic assistance of Colonel Li, the head of the Political Department's Anti-Enemy Broadcasting Team, we were led to interview Tanaka Hisaichi, the Japanese Lieutenant General who once commanded the clouds and winds in South China, known as the "King of the South," and who, having been designated a war criminal, was recently detained. He was the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Southern China Expeditionary Army and Governor-General of Hong Kong.

The car drove for ten minutes on the dusty path, and only after completing a registration procedure were we allowed to drive inside.

Japanese War Criminal Detention Center

This war criminal detention center was originally the Swire warehouse and Watson's soda factory before the war. During the war, it was used by the Japanese as barracks for the Japanese military police and a car repair shop. However, now, one side of the road is piled with broken tanks, cars, and trucks, while the other side has dilapidated and bullet-ridden empty factory buildings. A desolate scene makes one realize the cruelty and horror of war. However, when you enter the buildings inside the war criminal detention center, you have a different feeling because it is located on the banks of the Pearl River; the environment is exceptionally beautiful, spacious, and the air is fresh and pleasant. The war criminals leisurely sat under the shade of the trees; those hiding in the rooms, upon seeing the reporters arrive, crowded out to look, cracking their mouths into strange smiles. As we passed by them, they all stood at attention and saluted. Two of them, familiar with Captain Li, ran over to warmly shake hands and chat with him.

Japanese Military Police Predominate

"There are more than 560 war criminals detained here," Major General Yuan Xiqi, the director of the war criminal detention center, told the reporter. "They are all Japanese, among whom more than 400 are Japanese military police. There are also quite a few high-ranking Japanese officers; three are lieutenant generals: one is Tanaka Hisaichi, one is Kondo Shinpachi, commander of the Japanese 130th Division, and the other is Sue Tomochika, commander of the 104th Division, who was only detained on the 2nd of this month. There are also three major generals: one is Hirano Kiichi, one is Shimokawabe Kenji. These two are both brigade commanders and another is Shigetō Norifumi, a military police commander."

Brought Five Attendants

Director Yuan continued, "They are now living in three separate areas: the generals live together, the military police live together, and the war criminals transferred from various places also live together. Their food ration is 25 taels of rice per day, and the supplementary food allowance is 100 yuan. They can move freely within this area. When war criminals enter, their clothing must be registered, and fingerprints are taken. Books can be read after inspection. Tanaka Hisaichi was only transferred here yesterday (the 4th). Director Zhang of the military headquarters has granted him permission to bring five attendants: an adjutant, a doctor, a nurse, a servant, and a cook."

Japanese-Style Bungalow

After Director Yuan finished speaking, he led the reporter to a Japanese-style bungalow. The house had corridors in the front and back, with three rooms connected in the middle. The first room was occupied solely by Tanaka Hisaichi. The interior was simply furnished, with several thick mats spread in the center and a small stove placed in the middle of the mats. A cloth partition in the left corner formed a dressing room. At this time, Tanaka was on the wide corridor in front, sitting in a rattan chair next to a large round table, looking at the trees, facing the leisurely flowing river surface, in a very relaxed state. After Captain Li conveyed the reporter's purpose, Tanaka hurriedly and humbly stood up to express his welcome, and we sat down around the large round table.

Tanaka is a short and wiry figure. His small body was draped in a Japanese military uniform with the insignia removed. His face was thin, his cheekbones slightly protruding, the corners of his eyes drooped a little, and he wore a pair of tortoiseshell glasses on the bridge of his nose. He had a small mustache on his lips, and was a typical old Japanese soldier. No matter how deliberately he tried to assume an attitude of composure and serenity, he could not conceal his depressed and deep emotions. He is now 58 years old, from Kyushu, Japan, a graduate of the military academy and army university, and has served as an instructor and platoon leader in various Japanese military schools and as a division commander. He has been in South China for more than two years. But he told people that he had not participated in any battles, only in the Xijiang battle in the 32nd year of the Republic. After Japan surrendered, he represented the Japanese army in the South China region to sign the surrender, and served as the head of the Japanese prisoner liaison department. This time, he was arrested as a war criminal on the grounds of directing the killing of downed American airmen and the murder of innocent Chinese civilians.

Extravagant Talk of His Mission

After Director Yuan briefly inquired about Tanaka's life, Tanaka, without waiting for the reporter to ask questions, told Captain Li that he wanted to say a few words to the reporter. Captain Li then voluntarily helped us translate.

"My mission here is to repatriate more than 100,000 Japanese prisoners of war. Now that they can all be transported back to their country before the 15th of this month, my mission will be considered complete." He seemed to not yet know that he had been designated as a war criminal, and spoke at length about his "mission."

"The Japanese prisoners of war in the concentration camps have received the utmost courtesy from your country, for which they are infinitely grateful. They will return with an excellent impression, and they will undoubtedly work hard for future friendly relations between China and Japan. I am thinking of using my status to prepare to write a letter or an article, on behalf of the Japanese people, to thank your country for its generosity and courtesy."

Wants to Read the Three Principles of the People

"Now I feel as if a heavy burden has been lifted, and my mind is as clear as a 'newly washed mirror,' exceptionally serene. I am repenting of everything in the past, which need not be said further. If this old and decrepit body of mine has the opportunity to return to my country, I will do my best to work for future friendly relations between China and Japan. Now, as a war criminal, I am waiting every day for China to recover soon!"

His set of clever words, praise, and prayers were the kind of conversation the reporter expected. When the reporter asked about his life and hobbies, he said that his state of mind was very good, and the place he was staying was as comfortable as a villa. It was just that he had a stomach ailment and wished to exercise and plant more when the weather was sunny. His only hobby was reading. He loved literature, and he also wanted to read the Three Principles of the People. He said it was a pity that his Chinese was not very good, which he considered his greatest regret. He also asked Director Yuan to give him more religious books to read. These words were clearly intended to show that he was a peaceful person, and that his current repentance could erase his past crimes. As for his saying that he wanted to read the Three Principles of the People, this was becoming increasingly skillful.

Admits Past Mistakes

When the reporter asked about his feelings on the Chinese battlefield over the past two years, he only said, "Although your country has suffered greatly from this long period of warfare, I believe that Tokyo and Osaka were even more miserable during the war! However, as the saying goes, 'no discord, no concord.' In the past, I only heard about China, but I didn't understand it. But now I have a thorough understanding of China. We admit all the mistakes of the past, and I now sympathize with your country very much. Since the September 18th Incident, you have been receiving anti-Japanese education, while the Japanese have been receiving education in aggression, but now all of that is in the past. I only hope that the friendship between China and Japan will be re-established, and I even hope that China can pull Japan up, because Japanese culture is entirely derived from China!"

The Pain of a Broken Family

After he spoke this specious theory, the reporter further asked about his family situation.

"I have two sons: the elder one has already died in battle. Now I only have a young son who is thirteen years old. Last February, I received a letter from them, but later my home in Tokyo was destroyed by Allied planes, so I have no way of knowing how they are now." He said with what seemed like endless emotion.

"The environment here is so peaceful. When you see the leisurely river water and the coming and going of ships every day, what are your feelings?" the reporter asked curiously.

"Green Willows, Not Red Flowers"

"When I see the red sun setting every day, with the setting sun reflecting on the Pearl River, I am very happy. So every day when the tide is high, I sometimes can't help but feel some emotions and want to write a few poems, but I haven't started writing them yet." He hung a bitter smile on his face, and then said again, "I admire Lao Tzu's doctrine, the so-called 'green willows, not red flowers,' my state of mind and fate are like 'flowing water and floating clouds,' I can only let nature take its course."

At that time, he lowered his head, his eyes fixed on a copy of "Japanese Drama Theory" by Niizeki Ryozou lying in front of him. After a while, he raised his head again, looking at the distant river surface, seeming to be lost in thought. Finally, the reporter asked about his feelings after receiving the news of Japan's surrender. He said, "It is really difficult to express in words; the complex thoughts at that time cannot be conveyed in words." After a slight pause, he sighed softly and said, "However, after the ceasefire, very few of our officers and soldiers deserted, and they were able to strictly observe discipline. They have all returned now. However, whether they will be able to see their families when they return, whether they will have food to eat, I am afraid it is still hard to say!"

Seeing the "Tiger of South China"

Captain Li then led the reporter to the second room, where the two lieutenant generals mentioned earlier lived. At that time, the two were playing Go. Captain Li said that the Japanese army has what is called "one dragon, two tigers." The so-called "dragon" is in North China, one tiger is Yamashita Tomoyuki, the "Tiger of Malaya," and the other tiger is Kondo Shinpachi, the "Tiger of South China" who is currently playing Go. They are famous for being good at fighting.

Passing through the third room, there were the living quarters for the three Japanese major generals. Shimokawabe Kenji, who had a pair of "Hitomoto" mustaches, was there engaging in drawing as a pastime. When he discovered the reporter passing by, he laughed loudly and said, "Do you think my two big mustaches look like a typical Japanese warlord?" In reality, he was probably forcing a smile.

About ten minutes later, our car unknowingly crossed the majestic Haizhu Iron Bridge again. We all looked down at the river water under the bridge, gently caressing the bridge piers. Captain Li immediately recalled what happened yesterday. He said that yesterday, when he was escorting Tanaka Hisaichi to the war criminal detention center, he was also on this bridge. Tanaka was moved and said, "Guangzhou's spring is warmer than Tokyo's!"

Production and Construction Special Issue

### Where are China's Technical Talents Going?

— Yang Mou

Facing the ruins left to us by this war, everyone will feel a serious sense of responsibility. No matter how much hardship and suffering we have endured in the flames of the War of Resistance, what is coming now is definitely not enjoyment and comfort, but we should use redoubled perseverance to endure and overcome all difficulties, and rebuild our country on the ruins.

Our country is now like a body covered in wounds, yearning for the rise of all the people. The responsibility that history bestows on every Chinese descendant is heavy, and the opportunity that history bestows on every Chinese descendant to develop their talents is also unparalleled.

Let's take a look at the newspapers:

Railroads lack sleepers, rails, and locomotives; shipping lacks ships; aviation lacks airplanes; and there is a widespread shortage of fuel. Factories, like hungry beasts, are supposed to be working hard to process and move forward, but instead, they are collapsing. Labor strikes are frequent, the number of unemployed is soaring, materials are scarce, and prices are skyrocketing...

So many difficult destinies have befallen our country.

According to reports, in order to repair the southern section of the Jinpu Railway, the authorities have decided to dismantle the Wuhu Railway near Nanjing. As soon as this news spread, food prices in Nanjing rose in a straight line. How heavy does such news of robbing Peter to pay Paul make your heart feel? And at the National Highway Conference, the universal complaint was the lack of materials and the lack of funding. Six months have passed since the victory, but after closely observing all the situations that are not on track, one truly feels like weeping but having no tears. The terrifying giant hand of war has already been driven away by us, but the giant hand of post-war economic panic has already reached in.

This is an extremely difficult situation! This is an extremely difficult situation! Only by overcoming this difficult situation can we reach the light. If we fail to overcome it, we will forever sink into the abyss of darkness. Of course, we can also use external forces, but remember, what "external forces" hope for us is definitely not simply the prosperity of China; they also have their own vested interests. The more we use external forces, the heavier the burden we ourselves bear.

Where are China's technical talents going?

Of course, we cannot deny that many technical talents have persevered through hardship and made immortal contributions to the War of Resistance in the rear. However, many, many more, driven by the necessities of life and constrained by various circumstances, have expressed discouragement towards China's construction and turned to the speculative business world. This is not an accidental phenomenon; it is a widespread phenomenon. Many, many trained technical talents have sacrificed what they have learned and are rushing to speculative paths. Of course, in our country, which is poor in everything, being a technical talent is indeed a very difficult job. Of course, the treatment that the country gives to technical talents is far from enough to support a family. Of course, the country has never had clear methods for the appointment and promotion of technical talents, and everything is always a mess. Of course, the country has no guarantee for the positions of technical talents. - Even if all the reasons are true and sufficient, they cannot be used as an excuse to avoid being a technical talent.

Because, because the country is calling you, the country needs you!

The fate of technical talents themselves is inherently difficult. They have to create from scratch, and they have to grow from thorny ground. No hardship can threaten them; their history is entirely a history of creativity and struggle. Now that the country is calling, what reason is there to refuse?

What our country needs now is only "repairing bridges and paving roads." We only hope to repair the destroyed roads and restart the factories that have been shut down, but no one can deny that there are many, many more arduous and greater tasks.

Chinese technical talents? Where are you going? Stand up straight and embark on the difficult path? Or continue to evade?

What history has bestowed is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. We only have the right to accept, not the right to refuse! Moreover, this is not just a right, but also an obligation. As the country restores its strong and majestic appearance from broken ruins, should we, as citizens, still be concerned about the gains and losses of individual interests?

In the flames of war, we have spent eight years of the worst destiny. Now, new life is growing. Listen to the call of the country! Chinese technical talents, I will repeat once more, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!

Zhan Tianyou and Fan Xudong have pioneered the way for us. By reviewing their history, you can know how heavy the burden that every Chinese technical talent bears is.

### Rich Assets of the Northeast

— Xian

The Northeast covers an area of ​​approximately 500,000 square miles, accounting for one-seventh of the country. The population is 43 million, accounting for one-tenth of the country's population. However, the assets it possesses are equal to the sum of all other regions. A comparison of the assets of the Northeast (pre-war) with the mainland is as follows: Northeast Mainland Number of factories 3,900 3,850 Railway length 7,590 miles 7,319 miles Steel production (annual) 450,000 tons 50,000 tons Coal (annual) 15,000,000 tons 25,000,000 tons

As for the undeveloped resources of the Northeast (oil, gold, manganese, tungsten, iron, coal, etc.), it is estimated to be approximately 15,000,000,000 tons. (US New York Times Overseas Weekly)

### Introduction to Business Management

— Xu Baiyi

V. Business Cycle

Regardless of the type of business, in addition to striving for a sound organization, one must also take into account the environment, because no business can exist apart from the environment.

In fact, there are two ways to deal with the relationship between business and the environment: one is to adapt to the environment, and the other is to create the environment. In terms of the ease or difficulty of implementation, adapting to the environment is certainly not easy, but creating the environment is even more difficult.

In terms of the environment that should be considered, the most important is the business cycle. This can be illustrated with charts. Every manufacturer should have accurate statistics on the total sales, total production, and total profits for each year, and then draw them into statistical charts, so that they can be seen at a glance.

In the statistical table, you can see the upward or downward trend. The trend from good to bad is gradually moving towards recession, and the change from bad to good is a turning point. If a manager uses the chart, he can see the trend of business. During the period of decline, he should try to save the situation, and don't wait until the last step before trying to find a solution, which will be more laborious. When the situation is improving day by day, pay attention to the possible changes at all times, and proceed with a certain step. If you are blindly aggressive, then a situation of being too big to fail will occur. The number of employees will increase, and the equipment will also increase, but as a result, sales will be stagnant, which will make capital turnover difficult. At that time, you will have to sell the goods cheaply or painfully lay off employees or reduce salaries, so that the business cannot be operated smoothly.

The United States experienced an unprecedented recession in 1920. The reasons for the recession are as follows:

1. At that time, banks over-loaned and suddenly contracted, so industry and commerce could not use bank overdrafts, so they could not develop forward and could only be conservative. Some industrial and commercial enterprises had to sell goods cheaply in order to repay bank loans, and because of cheap sales, they had to reduce profits, or even lose money.

2. Transportation agencies were temporarily disrupted due to the war, so goods could not be smoothly delivered to various places, and there was a surplus phenomenon after production.

3. The rise in the cost of living made the general income unable to keep up with the general prices. They could only stop buying, and after the retail stores' business was dull, the producers' goods could not be sold smoothly.

4. General hoarding in the market, hoping to obtain a good price, so raw materials and manufactured products were hoarded. Once the recession started, they were thrown out one after another, which was unfavorable to general industry and commerce.

When one of the above situations exists, you should try to seek a remedy to save the future of industry and commerce, and never wait until you temporarily find a solution, you will feel that it is too late in fact. In terms of China's situation, during the war, many industrial and commercial enterprises hoarded goods in large quantities and greatly increased their capital. After the victory, they will encounter unprecedented difficulties.

In order to handle the business smoothly, we must train ourselves to see the possible changes in the business situation in advance. We can use the recession era in the United States in 1920 to explain. A person who understands the business cycle can foresee the future crisis as early as 1919. Because before 1919, many industrial and commercial enterprises were in mass production, and because they needed working capital, they all overdrafted from banks, which resulted in the banks' lending amount having to be limited, so the amount was reduced and the interest rate was increased. A discerning manager can see this early and quickly balance his production and sales.
