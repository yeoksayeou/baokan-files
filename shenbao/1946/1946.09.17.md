Chen Cheng, Du Yuming

[Report from our Beiping office, 16th] Chen Cheng and Du Yuming flew to Shenyang from Beiping at 2:00 PM today. It is reported that Chen's visit to the north was to discuss with Li Zongren and others matters such as military reorganization, defense deployment, and is also said to be related to the restoration of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway traffic. Last night, Chen invited Li Zongren, Sun Lianzhong, Chen Jicheng, Wang Hongshao (Chief of Staff of the Provisional Headquarters), Song Yuntang, and Li Wen, Chief of Intelligence of the Commander-in-Chief's Office, to a military meeting, which lasted until after 1:00 AM. After 9:00 AM this morning, more than 30 leading figures from the party, government, and military of Beiping and Tianjin, including Li Zongren, Sun Lianzhong, Chen Jicheng, Xiong Bin, Zhang Boying, Mou Tingfang, and Hu Bohan, visited Chen at the Diplomatic Building. Du Yuming also accompanied them, bringing many others. In the spacious living room, they conducted a broad and informal review of various issues in North China. In addition, Chen had separate talks with Feng Qinzai, Chairman of Chahar Province, Zheng Jiemin, member of the Executive Headquarters, and Xu Kangliang, Commander of the Beiping Air Force District. Chen took a trip to the Summer Palace yesterday amidst his busy schedule and also visited Hu Shi and Fu Sinian. It is reported that Chen flew from Gu to Zheng on the 8th and inspected the areas around Kaifeng, Lanfeng, and Xinxiang. He only flew to Beiping yesterday with Du Yuming and Gao Guizi.

[Report from our Beiping office, 16th] Du Yuming accompanied Chen Cheng to Shenyang by plane today. Before his departure, he told our reporter that there would not be large-scale military conflicts in the Northeast recently, but if the Communist army attacked, the National army would resolutely counterattack at any time. This trip to Gu was to report the situation in the Northeast to the Chairman. When the reporter asked what instructions the Chairman had for the Northeast, Du replied that the Chairman instructed the Northeast to pay attention to restoring order and stabilizing people's livelihood. Du's face was much fuller than when he was recuperating in Beiping. He left Gu and flew to Zhengzhou on the 14th and arrived in Beiping yesterday on the same plane as Chen Cheng.

[Report from our Beiping office, 16th] If the Communist army does not lift the siege of Datong, will the National army attack Zhangjiakou? Chief of Staff Chen Cheng answered this question very cleverly. He said: "You can study and research it. If the Communist army does not lift the siege, is it better for the government forces to clear the Tongpu Road or attack Zhangjiakou?" The reporter pressed: "Didn't the Chief of Staff once say that Datong and Zhangjiakou are on the same battlefield?" Chen replied: "I said it, but it's a common practice in military strategy to make the real seem unreal and the unreal seem real." When asked about his mission to the Northeast, he cautiously said that he had not yet decided to go. Three hours later, he and General Du Yuming flew to Shenyang. Today, reporters from this newspaper and Ta Kung Pao only had a three-minute conversation with General Chen. It was when he was walking and talking as he got out of the building and into the car. Chen looked rosy, and his stomach ailment seemed to have healed, but his hair was even whiter than silver.

[Report from our Shenyang office, 16th] Chief of Staff Chen Cheng, accompanied by Chief Du Yuming, arrived at Beiling Airport at 4:30 PM on the 16th. Director Xiong and others went to welcome him. Those who came with Chief of Staff Chen included Xu Langxuan, Chief of the First Division of the Third Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, and Gao Dechang, Chief of the Third Section of the same division. Chen told our reporter: "This is my first time in the Northeast. After arriving in Shenyang, I saw that many places in Shenyang were destroyed, but Shenyang is still our Shenyang. Everyone should work hard to build this land. This trip is to see the situation in the Northeast. I haven't decided where to go from here yet." Chen looked energetic and very happy. Chief Du flew to Gu on the 12th and returned on the 16th. According to what he told the reporter: "This time, I went to see the Chairman to report on the recovery of Chengde and the suffering of the people. The Chairman is very concerned about the Northeast, especially hoping to restore order and stabilize people's livelihood." He accompanied Chief of Staff Chen to Zhengzhou on the 14th for inspection.

[Agence France-Presse, Beiping, 16th] According to sources from the Communist side, the Northeast government forces divided into three routes yesterday and began to attack Harbin. The battle is currently taking place near Taolaizhao on the north bank of the Songhua River. Du Yuming, Commander of the Northeast Security, has returned to his defense post after seeking instructions from Chairman Chiang in Lushan. Du will directly command the military operations to attack Harbin.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 15th] According to reports: the 33rd Regiment of the 11th Brigade of the Communist army and the 3rd Regiment of the Independent Division, attached with two mountain guns and rapid-fire guns each, launched a fierce attack on the National army stationed at Xin Kai Ling, ten kilometers southeast of Dashiqiao, at 5:00 PM on the 13th. As of 8:00 AM on the 14th, the battle was still ongoing. Based on the overall situation in recent days, it seems that the Communist army will launch a large-scale offensive in the north and south of Liaoning Province.

### Communist Forces in Jining Completely Eliminated; National Army Vanguard Reaches Sumu; Datong Garrison Launches Attack to Recover Strongholds

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 16th] Starting on the morning of the 16th, the Datong National army launched attacks in multiple directions. As of 11:00 AM, they had recovered eight strongholds, including the Police Academy west of the city, Wulidian, Majunying, Zhujiazhuang, and the airport south of the city, Shuiquanwan, Beiyue Temple, and Zhoujiadian. On the east side of the city, the National army had crossed the Yu River and were advancing towards Qijiadian, Caifulou, and Shaling.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 16th] More than 600 Communist troops in the Qilicun, Beiyue Temple, and Zhoujiadian areas south of Datong launched another attack on Nanguan and Wayao Lin around 10:00 PM on the 14th. After fierce fighting, they were repelled in the afternoon and are currently confronting the National army at a distance of 100 meters. On the same day, a unit of the Communist army, fifty kilometers south of Wulidian west of the city, infiltrated under the cover of mountain guns, but were suppressed by artillery fire from the city wall and fled back after suffering losses.

[Central News Agency, Gui Sui, 15th] The National army rescuing Datong continued to advance after recovering Jining. The vanguard has reached Sumu (one station away from Jining). There are currently no traces of the Communist army within thirty miles around Jining.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 16th] The people in the two counties of Hequ and Pianguan in northwestern Shanxi suffered unspeakable hardships under the occupation of the Communist army. Wei Zhuwuying, fearing the people of Hequ County, led the security team to recover Pianguan City on the 12th, dividing his troops to capture Guanhekou in the north and Louziying in the south. On the 13th, they continued to capture Hequ County, and are now advancing towards the Xunzheng area. The people of the two counties are overjoyed to see the light of day again.

[Report from our Beiping office, 16th] Yesterday's air force reconnaissance report stated that there were no traces of the Communist army within fifty li around Jining. The Communist army in Jining adopted a centrifugal strategy, retreating in all directions. One branch retreating towards the northeast was bombed by the air force en route, suffering half casualties. It is reported that the Communist army suffered more than 20,000 casualties in the Jining campaign, most of whom were killed after arriving at the periphery to reinforce Jining. The coordination between the National army's land and air forces was extremely thorough.

[Report from our Gui Sui office, 15th] The National army cavalry yesterday pursued and attacked the defeated Communist forces of E Yousan and Liu Chunfang, which had fled from Jining. At Honghaizi, forty li east of the city, they annihilated most of the 358th Brigade, killing 400, capturing 200 alive, and seizing 900 rifles, 20 light and heavy machine guns, and several mountain guns. The Communist army was surrounded by the cavalry. Many had blood coming from their mouths and noses, and they kowtowed to beg for mercy. Also, merchants from Beiping to Sui said that they saw the National army of the 11th War Area arrive in Xiahuayuan when they passed through, and they were advancing westward towards Zhangyuan.

[Central News Agency, Gui Sui, 16th] The eastern section of the Ping Sui Railway is being actively repaired. In addition to the fact that passenger trains have already resumed service from Gui Sui to Fusheng Zhuang, because the Communist army was defeated in both the Zhuozishan and Jining campaigns and did not have time to damage the tracks, repairs are relatively easy. It is estimated that the railway will be open to traffic in about five more days. However, the water towers and bridges that were originally damaged are difficult to repair due to the huge engineering work involved. Only temporary pontoon bridges are being built, and water tankers are carried with the trains to supply water along the way.

### National Army in Eastern Hebei Recovers Pinggu

[Report from our Beiping office, 16th] A general who came to Beiping from Tianjin this morning said that the National army has recovered Pinggu, the last county town in eastern Hebei occupied by the Communist army. The National army is currently conducting cautious mopping-up operations in the eastern Hebei plains covered by the green gauze curtains.

[Report from our Tianjin office, 16th] In the battles around Baoding, the Communist army is driving innocent civilians as the vanguard. For days, the Communist army has been attacking the National army at night, all driving civilians to form the vanguard, each holding hand grenades to charge and kill. After inspecting the corpses outside the trenches on the 15th and discovering the above situation, the National army has decided to use infiltration tactics to disintegrate the Communist army from behind in order to reduce the death rate in the war.

### National Army Going North Points Directly at Huai'an and Huaibei; Communist Forces in Northern Jiangsu Show Signs of Wavering; Moving Towards Huai'an and Bao'ying to Save the Critical Situation

[Report from our Taixian office, 16th] In the northern battlefront of northern Jiangsu, due to the National army pointing directly at Huai'an and Huaibei, the Communist army has shown signs of wavering. The Communist forces in the areas of Dongtai, Xinghua, and Yancheng are moving towards the area between Huai'an and Bao'ying in an attempt to save the critical situation. The Communist army in Shaobo is stepping up its defenses in view of the National army's northward advance. Also, a certain elite unit of the National army, after lifting the siege of Rugao, has now arrived in the vicinity of Hai'an and established contact with the National army originally stationed in the town. The Communist forces near Huangqiao have been moving towards Qutang and Baimi for days, their purpose being to strengthen the forces on the Qutang-Hai'an line in order to prevent the National army from advancing west.

[Report from our Xinpu office, 15th] The National army in northern Jiangsu has made rapid progress since recovering Suqian. The vanguard forces have now arrived at places such as Dingji and Xinji, more than twenty li southwest of Shuyang County. The Communist army's Fourth Regiment, entrenched in the territory of Shuyang County, seeing the tense situation, has experienced a mutiny in one unit. The Communist army has imposed martial law in its controlled areas starting from the 10th, prohibiting people from passing through, and conscripting young men from house to house, establishing a reserve regiment in each district in preparation for civil war.

[Another Dispatch] The Lianhai Line, the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, added automatic express trains on the 15th of this month, running four times a day in each direction.

[United Press, this city, 16th] According to a senior military officer of the National army in northern Jiangsu: except for a section of about fifty li along the Longhai Railway east of Xuzhou, the remaining Communist forces in northern Jiangsu and northeastern Anhui Province have almost been completely surrounded by the National army. It is rumored that in the Battle of Sixian, the 8th Division of the Communist Eighth Route Army was virtually annihilated, so those currently in contact with the National army are only the 2nd and 7th Divisions and the 9th Column of the New Fourth Army. The 8th Division is an elite force of the Communist army, and this spring it captured eight counties from the National army. Although the Communist army still occupies a section of fifty li of the Longhai Railway as a retreat, the National army officer said: "That section of land is flooded, which will make the transportation of the Communist army's troops and supplies extremely difficult, so its importance has been reduced. And since the recovery of Lingbi, Wuhu, and Sixian, the National army has broken into the western part of this rectangular encirclement, which is conducive to reducing the Communist forces."

National Army Recovers Many Strongholds

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 16th] Huaiyin is the main stronghold of the Communist army, and they often harass the National army. The National army there was forced to counterattack, and at 10:00 AM on the 15th, they recovered Chenjiaji (13 kilometers southwest of Huaiyin), Dabao (3 kilometers north of Chenjiaji), and Wangjia Taoyuan (9 kilometers southwest of Huaiyin). They then continued to counterattack Xiaoyuezhen (3 kilometers southeast of Chenjiaji), Matouzhen (7 kilometers southwest of Huaiyin), and Yangzhuangzhen (5 kilometers west of Huaiyin). The Communist army resisted stubbornly and counterattacked the National army at Matouzhen six times, but was finally repelled. By 4:00 PM, all of the above strongholds had been completely recovered by the National army. In this battle, about a thousand Communist soldiers were captured.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 16th] (1) The National army that recovered Siyang crossed the Grand Canal on the 14th and recovered Zhongxingji. The Communist army fled towards Shuyang. (2) The 9th Column of the Communist army, which had intruded into the Southern Xinjie (about 15 kilometers south of Siyang), was defeated by the National army on the 14th, and the area was recovered. The remaining Communist troops fled west towards Huaiyin.

### Bumper Autumn Harvest, Grain Prices Fall Universally; Economic Situation Bound to Change; Xu Kan Talks to Our Reporter

[Report from our Nanjing office, 16th] Minister Xu of the Ministry of Food met with our reporter at 5:00 PM on the 16th and made the following statement: "This year's autumn harvest has been bountiful in most parts of the country, and grain prices have fallen universally. However, because (1) the damage suffered by rural areas during the long eight-year war of resistance was extremely great, and has not yet returned to its original state in the short term; (2) in the disaster-stricken areas last year, due to the severe lack of manpower, animal power, fertilizer, and seeds, cultivation was not widespread; (3) in some areas with particularly abundant grain production, grain is currently being blockaded or destroyed, and transportation is also being destroyed or obstructed, making it difficult for the flow of grain to return to a state of equilibrium between surplus and deficiency; (4) before the war, the average amount of grain imported overseas each year was about 1.6 million tons, even in years of good harvest, it was around 1 million tons. Based on the above four points, with regard to the future grain situation, we sincerely hope that domestic transportation can be restored quickly so that areas with surplus or deficiency can be adjusted accordingly. We also hope that rice, wheat, and flour from abroad can be transported in as scheduled to enrich the people's food supply. In the coming months, it will be a season of falling grain prices, and grain prices in various places will continue to fall. We sincerely hope that wages and general prices can fall equally, then the economic situation will be greatly improved."

### Ambassador Marshall Leaves Gu to Return to Nanjing; Wu and Zhang Visit the Ambassador to Exchange Views; Zhou Enlai Arrives in Shanghai, Return Date to Nanjing Undetermined

[Report from our Nanjing office, 16th] Special Envoy Marshall and his wife will leave Gu on the 17th to return to Nanjing. The political activities in the capital will be determined after Ambassador Marshall comes down the mountain. At 10:30 AM on the 16th, Wang Bingnan of the Communist delegation visited Ambassador Stuart. Wang told him that the current war situation is serious and that there is an urgent need to convene a military three-person group meeting to discuss the necessity of a truce as soon as possible. He also said: "If we proceed through the political path through an informal five-person group meeting, it will not be easy to obtain the most effective way to resolve the current critical situation." Ambassador Stuart believed that the military problem is serious, but if we do not start from the political path to achieve the goal of a truce, then the so-called "truce" is still not a long-term solution. The Ambassador still believes that convening an informal five-person group meeting is the appropriate method at present. Wang left at 12:00. At 11:00 AM, Pi Zonggan, a counselor from the Nationalist government, also visited the Ambassador. Pi told reporters that this visit was half public and half private, because Pi brought his paperwork with him. At 11:20 AM, Pi drove away himself. At 4:30 PM, Zhang Lisheng visited Ambassador Stuart, and at 5:00 PM, Wu Tiecheng also arrived, and Pi Zonggan was also present during the meeting with the Ambassador. They left successively at 6:45 PM. It is reported that the content of the conversation was that Ambassador Stuart first told about his conversation with Wang Bingnan, and then they exchanged opinions. The Ambassador seemed eager to find an appropriate way to promote this peace negotiation.

[Central News Agency, Guling, 16th] Chairman Chiang and his wife and Special Envoy Marshall and his wife revisited the Five Old Peaks at 5:00 PM on the afternoon of the 16th and had a picnic there.

In the evening, Wang Bingnan, spokesman for the Communist Party delegation, said that Zhou's stay in Shanghai was indefinite, and he would only return when the military three-person group meeting had a definite date to convene, which is also sufficient to show the Communist Party's stubborn attitude. Also, Zhou's trip will use the "masses'" order to suspend publication as a matter to negotiate with various parties.

### Communist Army Uses Negotiations as an Excuse to Seek a Chance to Breathe

[Central News Agency, New York, 16th] The New York Times, according to what the American reporter stationed in Nanjing said, the Communist Party, in view of the recent military victories of the National army, wants to use Marshall to achieve a truce agreement, and said that there are signs that China has obtained a temporary peace. However, the newspaper expressed deep fear that this may be a Communist trick to gain a chance to breathe, thereby restoring its political war. Yan'an is good at political warfare, and propaganda and obstruction are its most important weapons. Yan'an, in addition to using guerrilla tactics, is not prepared to meet the National army on the battlefield. After the National army achieved a surprising victory in the Northeast last time, Yan'an showed a clear tendency to negotiate, which seems to happen again. But even if any concrete results can be produced, or it is only a tactical concession. Past experience tells us that this is just a Communist trick. The newspaper said: "The advancement of national policy has not launched a full-scale offensive against Yan'an, its purpose is only to 'force the Communist Party to withdraw from the many occupied lands it seized after the Japanese army surrendered, so as to end the economic paralysis caused by this occupation.'"

The Navy and Air Force can implement this in the current year, and it is planned to start with the Nanjing area first. However, Zhou Zhiliu advocates that it should be implemented first in the front-line areas. The Army is expected to implement this next year.

It is said that Director He Fengqi considered this matter to be of great importance, and for the sake of prudence, he would wait for instructions from Minister Wang before making a decision. It is heard that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers that people from all over are extremely concerned about this matter, and a formal statement may be issued within days.

### Traitors Zhou Fohai, Ding Mocun, and Others; Five Major Traitors Escorted to Nanjing Yesterday; Each Person Looked Discouraged, With Regret of "Thinking of Those Years"

[Report from our Nanjing office, 16th] The five major traitors, including Zhou Fohai and Ding Mocun, who are considered to have "special characteristics" by all parties, were flown from Chongqing and escorted to Nanjing at 4:45 PM on the 16th. Because the news was confidential, very few people knew about it in advance. Our reporter waited at the airport for two hours before seeing China National Aviation Corporation passenger plane No. 38 descending. The personnel responsible for the escort first deployed guards on the field. After the cabin door was opened, two small buses and two large trucks specially prepared by the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics drove up. Ding Mocun first stood at the cabin door, looking gloomy, wearing a gray gabardine long gown, white silk trousers, gray cotton black shoes, with a sallow complexion. Then Zhou Fohai also appeared. He was taller than Ding Mocun. According to observers on the field, he was much thinner than in the era of the puppet government, and his demeanor was also greatly discouraged, seeming to imply "I have also seen your end." Zhou was wearing a gray cloth long gown, white trousers, light red short socks, and black shoes. When getting off the plane, Ding was in front, and Zhou was second. Zhou entered the car box at a rapid pace. Next was Luo Junqiang, wearing a blue-gray gauze short gown and trousers, holding a raincoat. The three traitors rode in the same car. Then there were Ma, Yang (names unknown), and a maid riding in another car. There were also several men and women following, their facial expressions were very nervous, presumably they were their family members and followers. It is learned that they talked from time to time in the plane, their mood was discouraged, especially Zhou seemed to be unable to overcome the feelings of today and past, the luxury of when he invested in "Wang's regime" in the past and being a prisoner in Nanjing again. After getting off the plane, they were taken directly to the detention center at No. 19 Ninghai Road. Our reporter went to explore their life in the thunderstorm in the evening, but did not get to enter for a visit, but saw that the interior was a Western-style residence, with bright electric lights and open glass windows. The light and air were much better than the residences of the petty bourgeoisie. According to inquiries, Zhou and Luo lived in the same room, with two beds and a table in the room. Ding, Ma, Yang and their adjutant lived in one room, and the nurse and maid lived in one room. No one has visited after entering the prison. The guarding police officers all smiled and told that Zhou and others were very silent and did not say much, but their uneasy demeanor showed the regret of "thinking of those years" and "a single wrong step." It is also heard that Zhou and others will soon be transferred to the Capital High Court for trial.

Seven suspected bandits, including Wang Aju, were arrested and taken to the city for investigation.

[Our newspaper, Wuxi correspondence] Since the authorities sent Yang Yanbin as the commissioner for pacification of the lake bandits on Taihu's Pingtai Mountain and engaged in pacification work, Yang immediately sent his former subordinate Tang Guiye to the lake to make contact. Because they all wished to surrender, Yang decided to visit the bandit stronghold on Pingtai Mountain to meet with the bandit leader and discuss the procedures for their incorporation. At 6:00 AM on the 13th, Yang, together with Dai Junying, Chief of Staff of the City Defense Command, accompanied Tang Guiye and more than ten guards, departed from the city. At 2:00 PM, they arrived at Wutangmen and left the guards there to wait. Dai, Yang, and two others took a small gunboat and sailed to Pingtai Mountain. At the time, the person in charge of the bandit group, Hui Bingnan, was not on the mountain, as he had gone to meet at the invitation of Duo Hongde, Deputy Commander of the Taihu Suppression Zone. Zhang Kuan and a staff officer of the bandit group, Li, welcomed them and went up the mountain. They negotiated the procedures for the incorporation and reached a satisfactory result. Zhang and others stated that they had the consent of the leader, Hui Bingnan, and were willing to wait for orders to gather and accept the incorporation. It was agreed that the incorporation would take place at Xukou, near Wusimudu. After Yang and others returned to Wuxi, they reported to Chief of Staff Mao, who confirmed the date and ordered them to comply. The bandit group stated that they would guarantee navigational safety from that day forward, so that ships could resume sailing. That night, Yang and others stayed on the mountain and returned to the city the next morning. They had already reported the situation to Chief of Staff Mao.

### Minister Xie Instructs Prosecutors and Judges in Jiangsu, Stating the Judicial System Should Immediately Implement Chairman's New, Fast, and Practical Principles

[Our newspaper, Suzhou, 16th] Minister of Justice Xie, at 10:00 AM on the 16th, attended the joint weekly memorial service of the High Court and District Court, and addressed the assembled three hundred prosecutors and judges. He said: Reconstruction work, especially the judiciary, is the most important area, because the punishment of traitors and the resolution of civil and criminal disputes are all related to the national principles and social justice. The units below the Jiangsu High Court have achieved considerable results in the past year, but they are not yet perfect and require continued efforts from everyone. He also hoped that they would strive to implement the three words "New," "Fast," and "Practical" as demonstrated in the Chairman's speech, so that changing customs and turning weakness into strength would not be difficult to achieve. As for his explanation: "New" means adapting to the times, constantly striving for self-improvement, innovating daily, and evolving with the times. "Fast" means taking the psychology of the parties involved in litigation as your own, empathizing with others, and handling cases quickly. "Practical" means taking responsibility for judging cases, being down-to-earth, and handling cases impartially. He hoped that everyone would eliminate long-standing malpractices and strive to act diligently in all three areas. Xie continued to encourage his colleagues to take on responsibilities and endure hardships, and to bring glory to the entire judicial system. The weekly meeting ended at 12:00 PM. He then went to the Lion Grove for lunch and visited famous gardens such as Humble Administrator's Garden. He took a special train, the Xishan, back to Shanghai and then Hangzhou at 4:30 PM in the afternoon.

### Declaration of the Second National Congress of the Youth League (Continued from the Third Edition on the 14th)

(II) Here, we must also express our frank and sincere opinions on the current party issues in the country.

We believe that the ideal of communism and the Principle of People's Livelihood in the Three Principles of the People, which we believe in, differ only in philosophical foundation and implementation methods. However, the goal of transforming this economically deformed society into an economically equal and common society is the same. However, it is universally recognized by all Chinese and foreign people that Marxism, which originated in Western societies where capitalism has become deeply rooted after the Industrial Revolution, cannot be overly applied to China, which is lagging behind in industrial development. As for the discrepancy between the words and deeds of the Chinese Communist Party, it is even more obvious. The Communist Party used to call for resistance against Japan, but in reality, it used the opportunity of resistance to develop its power; it shouted for unity, but in reality, it attempted to divide the territory and undermine the unity of our country; today, it shouts for democracy, but in reality, it practices class dictatorship in the liberated areas it has opened up. From the advancement in the south and the invasion of the Northeast to the attack on Datong, it has never stopped its ambition to seize territory and attack cities, and its reckless actions that harm the country and the people. We really do not understand what their intentions are. What we especially and absolutely oppose is the Chinese Communist Party teaching people not to love their country and teaching people to diminish humanity. It is clear that the Communist Party disregards the interests of the country, does not hesitate to undermine our country's international status, and eliminates our nation's self-esteem. The inherent morality of the Chinese nation lies in loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, and peace. The reason why China was able to resist the aggression of Japan and obtain the final victory was not due to the superiority of science or organization in a few people, but due to the potential of the various inherent moral national spirits left by our ancestors. The Chinese Communist Party does not hesitate to destroy it ruthlessly. No matter what country or nation, it is especially necessary for its citizens to have the spirit of independence and freedom in order to establish itself in today's world. The Chinese Communist Party does not hesitate to ruthlessly destroy the most valuable cultural heritage of the country and the nation. Not only are we youths of the Three Principles of the People firmly opposed to it, but even the youths of all levels of society in the country, even those who have already joined the Chinese Communist Party, may not be able to bear it.

What we have always expected from the Chinese Communist Party is that they will abide by their promises made in the early days of the War of Resistance to support Chairman Chiang and thoroughly realize the Three Principles of the People, promote nationalization, integrate their armed forces into the country's military, and become a legitimate political party in order to promote the implementation of constitutional government. If they can win the sympathy of the people for their socialist policies and urge the government to implement them, then we, the youth of the Three Principles of the People, who originally regard the implementation of the Principle of People's Livelihood as our great duty, do not want to oppose them. Based on our conscience and our reason, we ask the many youths of the Chinese Communist Party to consider deeply, not to be intoxicated by a few ambitious people, and even more not to be coerced by dark violence and mislead the country and themselves. Only in this way can they be considered youths of the Republic of China and be worthy of being descendants of the Yellow Emperor.

In addition, we would also like to state here our opinions on other parties other than the Chinese Communist Party. We believe that in accordance with the great road of the Three Principles of the People and the grand plan of the National Father's revolution for our country, when the time comes for constitutional government, any party, as long as it does not violate the Three Principles of the People and does not plot to harm the Republic of China, can obtain legitimate existence and protection. The Three Principles of the People state that the country is owned by the people and politics is shared by the people. In the political thought of this century, this glorious and immortal proposition will inevitably be protected by all enlightened people. There is absolutely no reason for a fair and just political party to oppose the fundamental proposition of the Three Principles of the People. The policies advocated by the various parties now, although there are some differences, have not been able to escape the scope of the Three Principles of the People. The Chinese Nationalist Party has a glorious history of holding the Three Principles of the People revolution to save the country for fifty years, and today it has made great contributions to the Republic of China. At a time when the Chinese Nationalist Party is leading the people of the country to resist Japanese imperialism and is about to realize constitutional government, people from all parties have a patriotic conscience. They will inevitably cherish the past hard work of the Nationalist Party and accept the sincerity of the Nationalist Party to cooperate sincerely with all parties in order to achieve the goal of peaceful nation-building. If the interests of the party are placed above the interests of the country, and the morality of the political party is placed below the strength of the political party, it is not the demeanor that a politician should have. Especially for political parties in a democratic government, they must have the spirit of independence and autonomy and the magnanimity of being open and aboveboard. They must not be considered the outer circle of the Communist Party and speak for the Communist Party in vain. If their content and spirit are manipulated by the Communist Party and cannot be autonomous, and their actions and speeches are dominated by the Communist Party and they lose their independent purpose, then it does not conform to the spirit of today's democratic politics. We, the youth of the Three Principles of the People, not only feel sorry for them, but also feel disappointed in them.

(III) Based on the above-mentioned domestic enthusiasm and the various domestic political parties, we want to state our belief in the Three Principles of the People and our views on the current state affairs.

We deeply believe that the Three Principles of the People is not only the great road to save China, but also the truth to transform the lives of all mankind. The Three Principles of the People start from humanitarianism and focus on the survival of all mankind. It explores all the spirits of freedom, equality, and fraternity, and is guided by scientific thought. The Three Principles of the People is a combination of nationalism, democracy, and the Principle of People's Livelihood. We, the followers of the Three Principles of the People, naturally oppose fascism and imperialism. We cannot agree with the doctrine of class dictatorship that originates from materialism and ignores political freedom. We believe that to save today's chaotic China, we can only adhere to the Three Principles of the People and strive to implement the Three Principles of the People. Similarly, to save today's chaotic world, we can only seek a reasonable solution to the three major problems of human economy, politics, and nation based on the principles of the Three Principles of the People. First, internationally, we advocate faithfully abiding by the United Nations Charter, uniting all countries in the world, and solving all the urgent problems that need to be solved in a permanent way. All outdated ideas that attempt to use strong military force to dominate the world, as well as those that oppose racial equality, the freedom of the people, and economic interdependence, should not be allowed to exist. China, in its current chaotic situation, should promote the consistent spirit of justice and reason of our Chinese nation, fulfill our obligations as a member of the United Nations, to promote the cooperation of friendly countries, to implement our common war goals, to prevent the revival of strong politics, that is, to permanently eliminate the recurrence of war. The Three Principles of the People is the strength we rely on, and it is the unity of 450 million people. We must resolutely strive to realize the truth.

Secondly, domestically, we believe that today's China has entered a new era of constitutional government. It is the eve of the completion of the country by the people of the country, and it is also the beginning of difficult creation. The Peaceful Nation-Building Outline, etc., jointly decided by the government to convene the Political Consultative Conference of various political parties for the sake of peaceful nation-building, must be sincerely implemented throughout the country in order to achieve the goal of peaceful unification and democracy desired by the whole country.

However, what we want to point out painfully is that it has been a full year since the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, but why has the suffering of our compatriots deepened instead, the worries of the country have increased instead, the glory of victory has become increasingly dim, and the martyrs who sacrificed in the War of Resistance Against Japan have not been comforted? The creation of this humiliating phenomenon is really because the unity of our country has been threatened, the nation-building plan has not been realized, and also because the Three Principles of the People have not been implemented. Therefore, we want to awaken all compatriots in the country to truly recognize: (1) the necessity of supporting unity, (2) the necessity of implementing nation-building, and even more, to urge the government to fulfill its responsibility to implement the Three Principles of the People.

First: We must uphold national unity, which is an essential element of nation-building. It is the guarantee of social stability and the freedom of the people, and it is also a prerequisite for the implementation of democratic nation-building. We advocated the three major goals of peace, unity, and stability at the time of the end of the War of Resistance, and we have worked hard to use peaceful negotiation methods to make the Chinese Communist Party abandon its attempts to divide the country by armed secession and achieve true national unity. The government's consistent policy is precisely the urgent prayer of our compatriots and the unanimous support of our youth across the country; however, in the past year, despite the continuous negotiations, the Communist Party has always insisted on its concept of self-owned armed forces and feudal secession, constantly attacking the National Army and expanding its territory, and must destroy the unity of the country's military orders and political orders completely, creating the phenomenon of "a country within a country" and "an army outside the National Army," and even the traffic has been cut off section by section, the economy has been divided everywhere, and the restoration and relief work cannot be carried out. If this continues, not only will the people not be able to live, but the country will not be a country. In order to maintain the results of victory and safeguard the survival of the country, all our youth should not hesitate to sacrifice freedom, sacrifice life, sacrifice everything, to ensure national unity. It is determined that the urgency of saving the country today. For acts that undermine unity, our youth across the country must unite the will and strength of the entire nation, exert public opinion, and impose sanctions.

Second: We must implement the national construction strategy. Resistance and nation-building were originally national policies that went hand in hand. Immediately after the victory of the War of Resistance, nation-building should begin immediately. In the past year, it has been delayed and wasted. It must not be delayed any longer. We must do our best, overcome all difficulties, and speed up the progress of construction work. (The following text turns to the third edition)

Editorial

### Molotov's Astonishing Speech

Just as the vigorous debate in international circles sparked by American Henry Wallace's speech was beginning to subside, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, at the Paris Peace Conference's Committee on Italian Political and Territorial Questions, delivered a lengthy speech, lasting over sixty minutes. While ostensibly focused on the Trieste issue, the speech's scope was broad, and its underlying meaning demanded careful consideration. Regarding the veto issue, Molotov stated that rejecting or eliminating the veto would only aid those attempting to establish an Anglo-American bloc. Ignoring the Soviet Union in the pursuit of peace would be dangerous. The United Nations, if seeking to safeguard peace without Soviet participation, or even in opposition to the Soviet Union, was bound to fail. Any attempt aimed at eliminating the veto should be regarded as a prelude to a new war and rejected. He also asserted that 19th-century democratic principles were no longer suited to the 20th century, citing Greece and Bulgaria as examples of two different forms of democracy. While elections in Greece may have been marred by fraud and foreign interference, the Soviet Union had exerted no pressure on Bulgaria's referendum. Molotov's speech thus bordered on a veiled challenge. As Molotov's first speech since returning to Paris from Moscow, its significance was undoubtedly profound.

Regarding the Trieste issue, Molotov advocated rejecting the drafts proposed by Britain, the United States, or France, and fully adopting the Soviet plan, which outlined the following key points: (1) The Free Territory of Trieste should be designated as a neutral and demilitarized zone; (2) All foreign troops should withdraw from the Free Territory of Trieste within thirty days after the entry into force of the treaty of peace with Italy; (3) The Free Territory of Trieste should be economically integrated with Yugoslavia; (4) The government of the Free Territory should be responsible to the People's Assembly of the territory; (5) All Italian citizens residing in the territory, with the exception of those who supported the Italian Fascist regime, held official positions in the Fascist Party, served in the Italian police, were government officials who came to the territory from Italy after 1921, or were war criminals, should be granted citizenship in the territory; (6) An Allied Council composed of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France should be formed to organize the interim government of the Free Territory upon the treaty's entry into force, and should solicit the opinions of local democratic groups and parties; (7) The special responsibility of the interim government should be to convene elections for the People's Assembly within three months, forming the formal government of the Free Territory. On the surface, this plan appeared fair and just, but it concealed the following problems: (1) The plan did not specify a time limit for the existence of the Free Territory, unlike the drafts proposed by Britain, the United States, and France, which stipulated a period of ten years; (2) The establishment and existence of the Free Territory would be completely detached from the control of the United Nations; (3) The acquisition of citizenship by Italian citizens in the territory was subject to certain restrictions, effectively disenfranchising tens of thousands of Italians. As a result, Yugoslavs would gain control in the territory, and since this arrangement was not time-limited and the People's Assembly would be the highest decision-making body, the People's Assembly established under the Soviet plan could very well pass legislation annexing the Free Territory of Trieste to Yugoslavia. Thus, upon closer examination, the plan appeared to greatly benefit Yugoslavia. From the perspective of an objective observer, resolving the delicate and complex Trieste issue through this plan would not be as straightforward as simply annexing the territory to Yugoslavia.

We cannot deny that Molotov's speech was filled with vigor, presenting an interesting contrast to Wallace's weak and powerless remarks. In summary, the key point of Molotov's speech was to

intimidate generally weak-willed individuals, forcing them to unconditionally accept all of the Soviet Union's policies. As the Soviet Foreign Minister, Molotov repeatedly mentioned Britain, France, and the Anglo-American bloc in his speech, as if those capitalist countries were indeed establishing anti-Soviet states. When it came to the democratic system, Molotov candidly stated that only the Soviet system was a thoroughly modern democracy that could be implemented in other countries, while the British concept of democracy was outdated. All of this, if uttered by German or Italian propaganda ministers before the downfall of the Nazis and Fascists, would not have been much different!

Molotov brought up the Munich Agreement, which he abhorred, a matter that everyone should certainly remember. However, people might also recall the signing of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact on the eve of the outbreak of World War II in Europe. If the Munich Agreement unleashed a rabid Nazi dog, wouldn't the Moscow Pact signed by Molotov and Ribbentrop be akin to instigating that rabid dog to bite people? Let's forget about this unpleasant matter. Sincere cooperation and joint efforts to create world peace would be the best course of action.

Molotov's speech bluntly pointed out that the maintenance of world peace requires accepting the Soviet viewpoint, which is "Soviet Peace" (Pax Sovietica). In other words, all policies that differ from the Soviet viewpoint should be abandoned, and only the Soviet viewpoint is correct. This is truly a "world domination" centered on the Soviet Union. If the peace won at the cost of countless lives were to be built on the foundation of such a Pax Sovietica, then the heroic souls on the Pacific desert islands, in the North African deserts, on the beaches of Normandy, and on the entire Chinese battlefield would surely weep. This is an era that requires decisions! Humanity is also facing the eve of a new historical stage!

### Resolution Demanding the Recovery of Hong Kong

The Shanghai Municipal Council passed a resolution yesterday, requesting the government to negotiate the recovery of Hong Kong, Macau, and other territories ceded or leased under unequal treaties. This resolution not only represents the views of the four million people of Shanghai, but also the unanimous desire of our entire nation of four hundred million people!

The unequal treaties previously signed between China and various countries began with the Treaty of Nanking after the Opium War, and the cession of Hong Kong was a product of the Treaty of Nanking, along with the opening of five treaty ports. Therefore, the recovery of ceded and leased territories should begin with Hong Kong.

Britain should return Hong Kong and Kowloon to China. This is an obligation that cannot be delayed, both legally and practically. During the war, the leaders of the three major powers, China, Britain, and the United States, met in Cairo to discuss long-term plans for the Far East, and in principle unanimously agreed to return Hong Kong and Kowloon to China. US senators criticized Britain for its reluctance to easily give up Hong Kong. Even British authorities have stated that once the time is ripe, they will negotiate with China to discuss the return of Hong Kong. Stephen, the new British Ambassador to China, also solemnly stated when he departed from Britain to assume his new post: "Britain has no ambition in China other than commerce; it earnestly hopes that China will become a strong, stable, and unified country. The British government will do its utmost to assist China within the greatest possible scope to ensure that China becomes a strong and unified country." Everyone believed that with the unfolding of a new chapter in Sino-British relations, the stains on the diplomatic history of the two countries could be completely erased.

The British rule of Hong Kong and the lease of Kowloon to Britain are both the result of Britain's past aggression against China. Now that Britain regards China as an ally, and during the war, the two countries fought shoulder to shoulder against aggression, their friendship has been strengthened through the crucible of blood. Therefore, at this moment, not only for China's sake, but especially for Britain's sake, it is most timely to eliminate the vestiges of past British imperialism and to bridge the gap between the peoples of China and Britain.

Since the Labour Party came to power in Britain, it has adopted enlightened policies both internally and externally. Prime Minister Attlee has allowed India to become independent and announced the withdrawal of British troops from Egypt, earning worldwide acclaim. Recently, US Secretary of Commerce Wallace delivered a speech criticizing Britain for adopting imperialist policies in the Near East, which aroused deep indignation among the British people. This shows that Britain today no longer admits to maintaining an imperialist style. Accordingly, Britain's expression of following its past imperialist path in the Far East makes it even more necessary to return Hong Kong and Kowloon to China.

However, Hong Kong and Kowloon have been under British rule for a century, and negotiations with our country on the return issue will take some time technically. But we must not allow the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to keep delaying the matter. Some people in Britain may still hope to postpone it, but our people have the right to urge the government to start negotiations for recovery as soon as possible. Hong Kong does occupy a very important position in Far Eastern trade. Our demand for the recovery of Hong Kong and Kowloon is to maintain the integrity of our country's territorial sovereignty, and there is no other purpose. Moreover, we can also advocate that after Hong Kong is recovered, it should still be used as a free port for international trade, making it a trade center in the Far East and Southeast Asia. This is beneficial to both China and Britain, and to the world. We support this resolution of the Shanghai Municipal Council and demand that the government attach importance to this resolution representing public opinion.

### Transformation of Modern American Thought

Professor Fei, in a speech at Tongji University the other day, raised two important issues: first, world peace; and second, educational reform. From Professor Fei's perspective, we can see the transformation of modern American thought. Because Professor Fei himself admits that what he said is not only his personal opinion, but the opinion of the majority of modern Americans.

Regarding world peace, Professor Fei believes that in order to avoid war, it is necessary to establish a world police system. The police represent a kind of power, and the law cannot be enforced without power behind it. He acknowledged that this construction work is very difficult, but inevitable. Someone asked him if he believed in "power politics," and he said it depended on how it was interpreted. Just as Shanghai needs to maintain public order, it has set up a police force, but the police cannot be regarded as power politics.

Recently, after reading many speeches by American political authorities, scholars, and journalists, and observing many military preparations and demonstrations in the United States, we feel that behind these speeches and actions, there is indeed a new view of international relations that is latent among most Americans. Few people can say that Americans today deliberately want war and are unwilling to have peace, but their thinking is completely different from what it was after World War I. After the last war, they believed that peace could be achieved by peaceful means. After this war, while they still adopt peaceful means on the one hand, they actively prepare military force on the other hand. They clearly want to use military force to compel peace. This is a drastic change in the thinking of the average American.

If the world powers can, in the aftermath of this war, work together with one heart and mind, and build a world police system, the world will not be difficult to achieve peace. However, suspicion and fear arise between them, especially the increasingly acute relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. Since the United States and the Soviet Union cannot cooperate, and in order to demand world peace, everyone believes that the world police force is necessary. As a result, both countries intend to expand their own military strength to independently build the world police system. Even if their ultimate goal is peace, their current behavior seems to be tainted with the color of hegemony. The stronger the color, the deeper the suspicion, and the more difficult it is to cooperate. This is the crux of all the difficulties in the current international situation!

Regarding educational reform, Professor Fei gave us a surprising message. He said that many American educators advocate that students who study natural sciences and engineering should also take courses in social sciences, philosophy, and literature in the future. He also pointed out that several famous schools have extended the length of students' studies in order to complete the work of this educational ideal, such as the most famous Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which has been changed from four years to five years.

This reform movement originated from a new idea. Some American intellectuals, especially the experts who participated in the successful research of the atomic bomb, believe that the research on the relationship between "things and things" has reached an amazing progress, while the research on the relationship between "people and people" remains the same. But unless the latter research can catch up with the former research, scientific progress may destroy mankind itself! He pointed out that there are two aspects in the world of learning, one is Confucius, and the other is Einstein. Confucius' learning is about "people and people," and Einstein's learning is about "things and things." In today's terms, Confucius' philosophy may have many aspects that are not suitable for modern times, but his basic spirit is the most urgent need at present.

Standing in the position of the Chinese people, we feel that Professor Fei and the general American educators' new understanding is an unprecedented innovation for the American education system, and it provides us with a high-minded foresight for the Chinese education system. Chinese scientific research, in an era when professors can hardly maintain a minimum standard of living, is of course out of the question, and there is absolutely no danger of knowing too much. However, in the past ten years or so, the government authorities have developed a prejudice, valuing students who study science and engineering, and despising students who study literature, philosophy, and social sciences. For example, in each overseas study examination, the number of the latter is only one or two, and nine out of ten send the former. This prejudice and biased policy is unreasonable in principle. In the future, Chinese education, because of the urgent needs of the times, must not abandon scientific research, or even be in a reactionary and backward state. However, balanced development, without bias or discrimination, is at least the most sound way to cultivate young people. Our government authorities plan how to create a large number of "technical talents," and rarely plan how to create a large number of true and complete "people"! Our educators also advocate "scientific education" all day long, and rarely advocate "spiritual education" that can promote scientific application and scientific use! Professor Fei's remarks can also be regarded as a mountain stone for our future education.

The two issues of world peace and educational reform are interrelated. If the world is to achieve peace, human beings must help each other; and if human beings are to help each other, the majority of people in the world must thoroughly understand the relationship between people and people and understand each other. We hope that the United States will strive for educational reform in the process of transforming the two ideas, and avoid the starting point for aggression and domination; and on the Soviet side, we especially hope that the same transformation of educational ideas will also occur.

### Turkish Fleet Enters the Aegean Sea; Relations Improve Between Egypt and Turkey After Egyptian King's Visit; Rumor of a Military Alliance Between the US, Britain, and Turkey

[Agence France-Presse, Istanbul, 15th] It has been officially announced that the Turkish fleet is scheduled to sail from Smyrna to the Aegean Sea tomorrow for naval exercises. It is unknown whether the British and American fleets, which are also conducting exercises in the Aegean Sea at the same time, will meet. According to Turkish officials, the three fleets may not sail in single file through the Dardanelles Strait, as such a move would be too blatant a political action against the Soviet Union.

[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 15th] Egyptian government sources recently stated that after the recent visit of Egyptian King Farouk to Turkey, it is expected that relations between the two countries will have new developments in the shortest possible time. Although King Farouk's visit was informal in nature, Egyptian Prime Minister Nuqrashi Pasha issued a public statement to the press, strongly stating that King Farouk's visit to Turkey will have a satisfactory impact on relations between the two countries. In addition, King Farouk's inspection tour in the Red Sea area also visited Yanbu, which will also improve relations between Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, Britain is very interested in the possibility of improved relations between Egypt and Turkey. In addition, the dispute between Turkey and Syria over the issue of the Alexandretta region may also be resolved through Egyptian mediation.

[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 16th] The London correspondent of the Egyptian newspaper "Al-Misri" reports that if the negotiations between the Soviet Union and Turkey on revising the status of the Turkish Dardanelles Strait fail, Britain may propose that Britain, the United States, Greece, and Turkey conclude a military alliance. As for Egypt, it does not need to openly participate in such an alliance, because according to the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, Egypt follows Britain's lead. According to the four-nation alliance plan, the land and air forces will be under the command of the United States, the navy will be under the command of Britain, and the headquarters will be located in Ankara, with supply stations in Beirut. This Turkish plan has not yet been confirmed.

### US and British Representatives Firmly Advocate the Establishment of a Free State in Trieste; Should Be Separated from Direct Relations with Italy and Yugoslavia; It is Feared That the Peace Conference Will Be Difficult to Conclude Before the UN General Assembly

[Our Report] London, 16th Broadcast: The Committee on Italian Political and Territorial Questions held a meeting in Paris today to discuss the Trieste issue. British and American representatives reiterated their determination that Trieste should be separated from Italy and Yugoslavia, and also from the political conspiracies of any country.

[United Press, Paris, 16th] US Democratic Senator Connally today demanded that the Peace Conference establish a truly Free State of Trieste, not dependent on Yugoslavia or Italy. Connally further cited the principles agreed upon by the Council of Foreign Ministers regarding Trieste, stating that for the sake of peace, these agreements should be respected. "We must make Trieste a symbol of world peace and security." Earlier, Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Kardelj delivered a speech in the Italian Political Committee for an hour, claiming that Western powers were attempting to "draw a great iron curtain in the Mediterranean region." The Slavic bloc launched a movement to allow Yugoslavia to have control over the Free Territory of Trieste. The opposition of the United States and Britain to the Slavic demands is only to protect their rights in the Mediterranean. Their motives are neither concerned with the people of Trieste nor concerned with the people of Italy. According to Kardelj, he supports the Yugoslav proposal to have Trieste's customs and foreign affairs attached to Yugoslavia, while the Trieste government will be jointly established by the Four Powers Committee.

[United Press, Paris, 15th] The Paris Peace Conference has now entered its eighth week, but less than one-third of the work has been completed. The biggest disputes at present are two points: one is the Italian issue, and the other is the border dispute between Greece and Albania. The situation is tense and is about to reach the brink. Therefore, it seems highly unlikely that the work of the Paris Peace Conference can be concluded before the UN General Assembly convenes on October 23. These two issues are not only difficult for the Peace Conference itself, but also pose a crisis in the relationship between the Soviet Union and Western countries. The fate of the Free Port of Trieste is the biggest obstacle to the Peace Conference, and this issue has caused repeated twists and turns in the Four Powers Foreign Ministers Conference this spring. After the Four Powers finally agreed to designate the port as a free port, a small committee was formed to plan the detailed plan for the future establishment of the government of Trieste. However, as soon as this subcommittee met, its handling was tricky due to differences of opinion between the Soviet Union and the United States, Britain, and France. The same situation also occurred in the Paris Peace Conference. In short, the United States, Britain, France, and their countries all agree that Trieste should be international in nature, and its administrator should be appointed by the United Nations. Also, Trieste should be equally detached from direct relations with Italy and Yugoslavia. The administrator has broad powers in the free territory of the port. However, the Soviet plan proposed by Molotov wants a people's assembly to be elected by all the people of the port, and the administrative power of the port should be largely granted to this people's assembly. As for the power of the administrator, it should be strictly limited and not be responsible to the Security Council, but to the Four Powers. As for the issue of the Albanian-Greek border, there are also differences of opinion between the Eastern and Western blocs. The previous Four Powers Foreign Ministers Conference decided that representatives from Albania and Greece should present their views at the Peace Conference. At present, this dispute is being handled by the Peace Conference's Bulgarian Territorial Committee. Although Albania was formerly an enemy country, it demanded that the entire region of Western Thrace be assigned to Albania so as to obtain an outlet to the Aegean Sea. It has now formally proposed an amendment to the boundary, but Greece only requests a slight modification along the current boundary. The country did not formally propose a boundary amendment until last Friday.

### International Guard Army Issue: Soviet Union Delays Submitting Draft

[Central News Agency, New York, 16th] Local newspapers report that the Soviet Union has delayed submitting a draft on the principles of the basic issue of organizing an international guard army, thereby delaying the work of the United Nations Military Staff Committee, because the drafts of the other four powers have already been submitted. The Military Staff Committee has been holding secret meetings since March 26 this year, and little is known about its activities. What is known is that the committee has carefully considered the draft of its rules of procedure and procedure. Recently, it has been submitted to the Security Council for research so that it can be submitted to the Security Council. The current chairman of the committee is General He Yingqin, the representative of our country.

The people of the country have shown "great patience" with the Communist Party, always hoping that they will stop their treasonous and harmful activities.

### Newspaper Report from the New York Scripps-Howard Group: Calls for Wallace to Step Down; Truman's Approval of Speech Revealed

[Report from our newspaper] London Broadcast from Paris, 16th: The British Foreign Office spokesperson stated today that regarding the Wallace speech issue, the British government has made no diplomatic representations to Washington. This matter will be addressed by the Americans themselves in response to Wallace, it is said.

[Report from our newspaper] Broadcast from San Francisco, 16th: Today, the New York Scripps-Howard newspapers published an editorial stating that Wallace has caused too much trouble for Truman and his cabinet. He should no longer use his position in the cabinet to conduct "harmful activities." He should resign from the position of Secretary of Commerce; otherwise, he should be forced to take this step. The newspaper's Washington correspondent, Childs, described the process of President Truman's approval of Wallace's speech, stating that Truman never had the full text of the speech in hand. When Wallace went to the White House, he hastily read out several sections of the speech, which were not anti-British, but supported American foreign policy. Truman said, "We all agree on this point; I certainly agree." Later, after the State Department received the initial draft of the speech, Deputy Secretary of State Clayton tried to persuade Truman to cancel the speech. However, the initial draft was already being transmitted by radio, so President Truman and his advisors believed that canceling the speech would have even more adverse effects.

### US Drafts New Military Program Based on Atomic Bombs and Other Weapons (Arctic Ocean as the First Line of Defense for the Americas)

[United Press Washington, 15th] The Department of the Army revealed today that the American military authorities have abolished the military program of the Second World War and replaced it with a new military program. This new program, based on atomic bombs, radio-controlled missiles, and electronic inventions, has been drafted by the General Staff and has begun to be taught at the Army War College in Washington and the Command and General Staff School in Fort Leavenworth. The revisions to the military program include the following: (1) Expanded use of airborne infantry and paratroopers. (2) Intensified cooperation between ground forces and airborne forces. (3) Replacing the triangular divisions used in World War II with divisions composed of three combat units. (4) Using rockets and missiles for long-range bombardment. (5) Expanding the use of atomic bombs in radio-controlled missiles. (6) Taking the Arctic Ocean as the first line of defense for the American continent, with the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans as flanking defenses. (7) Intensified cooperation between the Army, civilians, and scientists. (8) Close cooperation between intelligence units and the Army, civilians, and scientists. (9) Organizing a strong air force with long-range bombing capabilities, training aviation detachments and air reserves. (10) Establishing a chemical warfare branch. (11) Developing radio-controlled missiles.

US Troop Numbers Sharply Declining [Report from our newspaper] Broadcast from Washington, 16th: A year ago, the total number of US troops was 12.1 million; a little over a year after Japan's surrender, the number of US troops has been reduced to 2.3 million, about one-sixth of the wartime peak strength. By the end of June next year, the number of US troops will be reduced again to 1,615,200, but this number only represents the "core" of the US Army, Navy, and Air Force, which can be rapidly expanded, making it more powerful than before Pearl Harbor. At that time, the US military could muster 450,000 troops.

Nimitz Discusses Troop Reductions [United Press, Philadelphia, USA, 16th] Chief of Naval Operations Nimitz declared here today that the US Navy currently has 500,000 personnel, one-sixth of the peak number during the war, which is large enough. He advocated an annual review in order to gradually reduce the number. All US Navy personnel who wish to leave have been allowed to do so, except for 3,000 naval personnel who remain in hospitals to care for wounded soldiers. Just as one cannot consider soldiers to be useless roots. As of today, science has yet to invent something that can replace soldiers.

### Hungarian Opposition Leader Advocates Forming a Fourth Power: An Alliance of Small European Nations with France to Participate in UN Activities

[Reuters, Budapest, 15th] The leader of Hungary's newly formed opposition Liberal Party, Szurdiuk, advocates that smaller European nations form an alliance with France to create a "fourth power." Szurdiuk stated in parliament that current world affairs are directed by the three major powers. Britain is too far or too close to the continent, the United States is in the Americas, and the Soviet Union itself is equivalent to a continent. Hungary should not become an appendage of any of the aforementioned three powers. France is the most culturally advanced power on the European continent. Although France is still busy dealing with its internal affairs, I believe that France will soon regain its position in major political events. Smaller European nations must rally around France to form a fourth power and participate in the work of the United Nations. Szurdiuk's speeches show that his Liberal Party is a left-wing democratic and Catholic party.

### 150,000 Overseas Chinese in Singapore Killed: British Witness Describes Japanese Atrocities

[Remodeling Society, Tokyo, 16th] The International Tribunal convened at 9:30 am today. Two defendants, Matsui, who had not been present for a long time, were also seen to be thin. Except for Okawa, all other 26 defendants were present. The prosecutor first finished presenting the situation of Japanese troops using prisoners on the Siam-Burma Railway, which had not been completed last week. Then, the Japanese army's massacre of Overseas Chinese after the fall of Singapore was tried, and the prosecutor submitted the "Investigation Report on the Handling of Overseas Chinese" as evidence.

[United Press, Tokyo, 16th] When the Liaodong International Tribunal opened today, it read out the documents of British witness Colonel White regarding Japanese crimes, which stated that more than 150,000 Chinese soldiers and civilians were killed by the Japanese army in Singapore. These people were all executed by the Japanese military police, and those suspected of being spies were especially mistreated. In a small guardhouse, as many as 57 men and women were detained, sitting with their knees bent for countless hours, and were not released for months. One European was tortured for 55 hours, another was beaten 144 times, and Japanese soldiers poured water into the mouths and noses of those arrested. The various atrocities were endless.

### Yoshida Cabinet's Position Becomes More Stable

Liberal and Progressive Parties to Merge

[Our Tokyo Correspondent, 16th] When the Yoshida Cabinet was formed, the people recognized it as a constitutional cabinet, that is, the purpose of the Yoshida Cabinet was to amend the constitution and submit it for passage at this session of the Provisional Diet. After the Diet session ended, it would collapse. However, the session of this Diet has been specially extended, and there is talk of further extensions, and Yoshida himself seems confident that he can maintain his cabinet until the Japanese peace conference. Generally speaking, such confidence on Yoshida's part is not impossible to realize. Because foreign trade is about to open up, the food shortage has gradually eased, and the Socialist Party's offensive against the government is not as fierce as imagined. In the negotiations of this National Railway labor strike, the Socialist Party's attitude was quite moderate and did not take unified action with the Communist Party. In the statement, it only hoped for a satisfactory solution, fearing that this strike would develop into a general political strike. The Communist Party originally wanted to transform this National Railway labor strike into a nationwide political strike, and then overthrow the Yoshida Cabinet, but this plan ultimately failed. The National Railway labor strike suddenly reached a compromise one night and canceled the decision to strike, which of course cannot be attributed entirely without the support of foreign aid forces. The resolution of the National Railway labor strike can be said to be a tonic for the Yoshida Cabinet, which is why the Liberal Party supported Yoshida as president. The Liberal and Progressive parties acknowledge that Yoshida will remain Prime Minister when the Japanese peace conference is held, and Progressive Party President Hiranuma will serve as the plenipotentiary representative to the peace conference. Therefore, the merger of the Liberal and Progressive parties can be achieved. Recently, rumors of a merger between the Liberal and Progressive parties have been growing, and it is recognized that it is possible to achieve this by next spring. Currently, the Liberal and Progressive parties have a total of 250 seats in the Diet, just over half, but Yoshida is still worried about his weakness and is trying to win over minority parties. Yoshida's recent reception of the Shinseikai also shows Yoshida's attempt to win over various parties.

### Great Raven in the Tower of London, Half a Century Old, New Elegy for the Deceased

[Agence France-Presse, London, 15th] There is a pair of great ravens in the Tower of London, the oldest ravens in the country.

The Tower of London administrators will match him with a 12-month-old raven "Kora" to prevent him from dying of grief. Kora will be transported to London from the depths of the Brigan Mountains.

### Bulgaria Announces Republic: Ex-King Prepares to Flee to Egypt

At the same time, Bulgaria's deposed Empress Joanna will take the deposed young King Simeon II and deposed Princess Marie-Louise through Istanbul, Turkey, to exile in Egypt with the deposed King of Italy.

### Youth Corps Second National Congress Declaration: Text Continued from Page Two

We believe that the biggest obstacle to national construction at present is the inertia of the general public after the war, and also due to the sabotage and obstruction of the Communist Party. We want to revive the economy and build society, while the Communist Party destroys transportation and breaches dikes. We want to prosper the countryside and restore industry; while the Communist Party wants to destroy the countryside and destroy industry. We want to coordinate agricultural and industrial production to improve people's lives; while the Communist Party separates agriculture from industry and isolates cities from villages. As for the overall construction: if transportation cannot be restored, materials cannot circulate, the economy is divided, and society is in chaos, of course, endless difficulties will be added; but the pain of our people's livelihood cannot be relieved without intensifying national construction, and the survival and development of the country cannot be guaranteed without intensifying national construction. Therefore, our national youth must recognize their goals, take responsibility, endure hardship, eliminate the inertia of complacency and fear of difficulty, work together, break through any obstacles and difficulties, and intensify our work of national construction to comfort the spirits of the martyrs of the Anti-Japanese War. Regarding the implementation of the Three Principles of the People, it is the unshirkable responsibility of the government. We believe that the implementation of nationalism has already achieved considerable success, and what urgently needs to be done now is the thorough implementation of democracy and people's livelihood. Regarding democracy, we believe that it is necessary to establish the rule of law, guarantee freedom, rectify political morality, eliminate corruption, improve administrative efficiency, effectively implement local self-government, establish people's representative organs at all levels, improve grassroots political organizations, and support the real power of the people, so that democratic constitutionalism has a solid foundation. Regarding people's livelihood, we believe that the government should be determined to earnestly implement the policy of equalizing land ownership and controlling capital. Regarding the former, it is necessary to effectively implement the 25% rent reduction, implement land laws and regulations, equalize land distribution, ensure that tillers have their land, and advocate the establishment of cooperative farms and collective farms to increase agricultural production and improve farmers' lives. Regarding the latter, it is necessary to strengthen financial management, suppress high-interest exploitation, guide commercial capital towards industrial production, promote labor-management coordination, protect the interests of workers, support agricultural and industrial organizations, establish a social insurance system, and effectively promote cooperative undertakings such as production, transportation, and consumption. Only in this way can our work of revolutionary national construction not be empty talk, and can we gain the trust of compatriots throughout the country. (We are confident that we are enthusiastic, brave, and pure Chinese revolutionary youth.) We have revolutionary beliefs and are by no means pessimistic about the future of China and the world. We believe that the Three Principles of the People is a doctrine that follows the principles of heaven, responds to human feelings, conforms to the trend of the world, and meets the needs of the people. As long as we work hard to implement it, there is no reason why it will not succeed. We all have a service-oriented, creative, correct, and noble outlook on life. We care about Chinese politics and the future of the country and nation, and are willing to sacrifice, struggle, and contribute everything to complete the great cause of revolutionary national construction. We are willing to maintain the loyalty and purity of youth for a long time and eliminate the secular idea of ​​getting promoted and making a fortune. We Youth Corps members pledge to abide by the Corps charter, serve the people, and sacrifice for the revolution. We are willing to be an unsung hero of revolutionary national construction. We absolutely abide by national laws and regulations and strictly abide by the disciplines of our country. We pledge to be believers in the Three Principles of the People and, under the leadership of our Corps Leader, do our best to build the country, and strive to be fighters for the national revolution. What we urgently request from the government today is to give the young men and women of our country ample opportunities for further education and employment, to give them ample opportunities to participate in grassroots national construction work, to cultivate the spirit of independent creation of young men and women, to strengthen all kinds of science and education related to national construction in national schools, and to be responsible for educating and supporting young compatriots in the border areas and overseas, so that all young people in the country learn modern knowledge and skills and concentrate under the banner of the Three Principles of the People to create a new China owned by the people, governed by the people, and enjoyed by the people.

(4) Our Corps has been established for eight years. Our Corps members have been constantly admonishing and earnestly expecting us to be revolutionary cadres and to make us the driving force of national construction. However, reviewing the past, the organization is not strict enough, and the work is not solid enough. For any aspect of the Corps, we need to make further efforts. We deeply miss every comrade who struggled and sacrificed his life against the enemy puppets during the Anti-Japanese War. In order to carry forward their glorious history, we should be more vigorous, self-improving, and unremitting to improve our Youth Corps.

We feel that in order to adapt to the needs of the times and strengthen the revolutionary forces, to eliminate the obstacles to revolutionary national construction, and to achieve the task of revolutionary national construction, our Corps must enrich the interior and strengthen the organization, such as the establishment of the democratic centralism system, grassroots organizational cadres, the implementation of policies, the recruitment of outstanding talents, etc., all of which are related to the future success or failure of the Corps. Detailed methods have now been determined and must be strictly implemented. This conference of ours has even more important decisions for the entire party: (1) Clearly stipulate the direction of the Corps' work in the future, so that the efforts of our Corps members in the future can be more practical and progressive; (2) Under the same doctrine and the same leader, the Party and the Corps share the common task of national revolution, but the cadres of the Party and the Corps are clearly divided, so that each specializes in its duties and does its best, so that the cadres have specific responsibilities and the work has specialized contributions, so that our Corps becomes a sound and strong revolutionary group of Three Principles of the People youth, and fulfills its important responsibilities to the times.

Finally, we would like to emphasize a few points: (1) The direction of the Corps members' efforts in the future is to tend towards active construction, and to shift from empty political activities to grassroots social service work. We must recognize that the root cause of our cultural and economic backwardness is the poison of the thousands of years of the wrong idea of ​​the literati and officials who get something for nothing, which leads to the separation of knowledge and production, and the separation of knowledge and occupation. In the future, we must be determined to establish professional positions, enter farms, factories, mines, enter the border areas, and participate in actual production work, in order to correct the general atmosphere of idleness and lay the foundation for national construction. (2) We are all Chinese youth. We must be independent and self-reliant in spirit and never lose self-confidence. We must not unknowingly become slaves to others. Of course, we must learn from others as much as possible in science and technology; but we must especially remember that we learn from others to enrich ourselves, not to lose ourselves. (3) We respect academic freedom and freedom of thought. Regarding the study of communism and the belief in communism, we stand on the position of academic freedom of thought and do not oppose it; however, the Communist Party's behavior of undermining national unity, disrupting social order, and destroying national morality not only destroys the future of our country, but also harms our youth as slaves. We truly patriotic youth must never tolerate it. (4) We firmly believe that we can only do something after we have not done something. We do not become officials, we despise politicians, we must work hard in various construction works, and are willing to contribute our mind and energy to social services and to production undertakings. We believe that transforming society is the fundamental way to transform politics, and building society is the fundamental way to build the country. If the country abandons various undertakings in society and does not harmonize, then clarifying politics and building the country will never have hope. (5) We must develop the ability to make correct judgments, distinguish right from wrong, and distinguish good from bad. We must oppose any dark forces that use our youth, deceive our youth, lure our youth, and make our youth embark on harming the country, harming the nation, and disrupting social morality, and we must thoroughly eliminate them. Every one of us youth has an independent and autonomous personality and has a sacred obligation to the country and nation. We must never allow others to use us to harm our country, harm our nation, disrupt our unity, disrupt our revolution, and thus ruin the future of our youth. I want to awaken the youth of the whole country, raise vigilance, and be wary of people who come to use our youth and harm our youth. (6) We must follow the Corps Leader's instructions in "China's Destiny" and the decisions of the First National Congress, earnestly call on the youth of the whole country to participate in the five major constructions, and the Corps members should take the lead in advocating and serving as a demonstration. We must pay more attention to scientific research, and it is necessary to implement social services, and cultivate our youth and train our youth from practical work. Otherwise, they will not be youth of the Three Principles of the People. Our Youth Corps must not tolerate such backward youth and recognize them as Corps members and comrades.

What we have said above is our common understanding, which is the call we have made on behalf of the youth of the country. Extraordinary times require extraordinary undertakings and extraordinary efforts. Our generation must not relax our mission to the times. Everything can be given to others, only the obligations and responsibilities to the country and the nation cannot be given to others. Everything can be compromised, only those who harm the interests of the country and the nation cannot be compromised. Comrades! Compatriots! The wind and rain are dark, but the rooster crows incessantly. We must unite as one, overcome difficulties, destroy the obstacles to the revolution, and save our country. We must take responsibility, hold high the torch of the Three Principles of the People, and strive forward, so that the new China of the Three Principles of the People and the new world of universal love and great harmony will be realized before us as soon as possible. (End)

### City Council Commemorative Week: Speaker Pan's Earnest Words, Hoping Councilors Demonstrate True Democratic Spirit and Conduct Reasonable Scrutiny of the Municipal Government Budget

[Our Newspaper] Speaker Pan stated in his address during the Commemorative Week: "Since the City Council began, it feels as if we have already walked halfway. The past week's agenda has been filled with reports and inquiries. In addition, we have held two subcommittee reviews and one full council review, but we have not yet reached the stage of discussion and resolution. Whether the mission can be completed still depends on our efforts this week. Currently, the outside world is very concerned about this council because its mission is extremely important. How the spirit of democracy is manifested in Shanghai, and thus in China, depends entirely on this council. The Shanghai Evening Post has criticized, saying: If you want to know the spirit of popular opinion bodies under the Kuomintang government, you only need to look at the current Shanghai City Council. Therefore, today, with the utmost sincerity, I hope that everyone will demonstrate the best performance and achievements in implementing a democratic political system. We must use a truth-seeking attitude to distinguish right from wrong, so that people understand that we are indeed sincere and genuine representatives of the people. Secondly, some people often think that the council and the government are in opposing positions, but this view is not a true understanding of democracy. For example, the British government itself is formed by the parliament, so of course there is no mutual opposition. Although China is still in a transitional period, and the municipal government has not yet reached the stage of being democratically elected, if we regard the entire Shanghai as a large company, the citizens are the shareholders, the municipal government is the management, and the council is like the board of directors, it is definitely not a mutually hostile relationship. The Shanghai Evening Post also said: Whether Shanghai continues to develop into a world-renowned metropolis or regresses into a second-rate, unimportant city in the future, the responsibility lies entirely with this council. Therefore, we must especially value our role as an institution that provides direction and decides policies. I hope to encourage everyone to work together to complete this important task. I hope that the budget review can be completed no later than the fourth subcommittee meeting. Regarding the municipal government's work plan, my personal thought is that the work plan is actually an explanation of the budget. It is really ridiculous that everyone is now separating them. Fortunately, almost three months have passed in the second half of the year. If this review cannot achieve the ideal result, we must proceed cautiously in the next year. If we want the municipal government to do things, we must give it money. Without money, how can things be done? Although we should, of course, still save where we can. Reviewing the budget and final accounts is really the focus of this council's mission. If we can perform well in this regard, we will lay the cornerstone of democratic politics. Therefore, we should conduct a reasonable review of this budget. As long as the municipal government is truly doing things, we should give it money, whether it is through increased taxes or issuing public bonds. This is my personal opinion."

### Armed Agencies Cannot Be Driven Away; They Erect Machine Guns to Resist: Dai Jimin Reports on the Numerous Difficulties in Housing Allocation

After a ten-minute break following Commemorative Week, Dai Jimin, Secretary-General of the Housing Allocation Committee, reported on the committee's work as follows:

The Housing Allocation Committee was only established on April 20 of this year. Previously, there were approximately 8,000 Japanese-owned houses in the Hongkou district. After the Japanese residents were successively repatriated in February and March, the remaining houses were occupied by powerful individuals. The Japanese Property Management Office, together with the municipal government and relevant agencies, organized a cleanup team to investigate. The results were found to be very bad. The Executive Yuan believed that it was necessary to establish a specialized agency to handle the matter, so preparations began on April 18, and the Housing Allocation Committee was established on April 20. The mayor serves concurrently as the chairman, and the committee is divided into general affairs, investigation, execution, and allocation groups. Existing personnel from relevant agencies were transferred to perform the work.

After its establishment, the initial plan was to first clarify the supply and demand situation, such as the number of houses available for allocation and the number needed by various agencies, and then allocate them fairly. However, in fact, the investigation work took a lot of time, and it was not completed by the end of July, so the method was changed: investigation and allocation were carried out simultaneously.

The allocation standard is based on the order in which applications are submitted, which are then submitted to the general assembly for review and approval. In fact, there are fewer than 200 truly vacant houses; the rest have already been occupied. For those agencies or private individuals who have moved in without authorization, the Allocation Committee allows them to fill out reports for review. Those who meet the regulations are issued permits, and those who do not meet the regulations are attempted to be evicted. However, eviction is very difficult. Some armed agencies simply cannot be driven away and even erect machine guns to resist. Later, they had no choice but to negotiate with their supervising agencies. In addition, for houses that originally had owners, the China Trust Bureau (中信局) uniformly leases them, so that the owners receive reasonable rent.

Of the more than 8,000 houses, some are municipal properties and are not included in the allocation. Only over 5,000 houses are available for allocation, while the number of applications from various parties requires more than 10,000 houses. Currently, permits have been issued for 2,439 houses, allocated to the Army 987 houses, the Air Force 136 houses, the Navy 79 houses, and others 1,237 houses. Among them, 1,524 houses were occupied first and then issued permits.

### Municipal Government's Budget Expenditures for the Second Half of the Year

[Our Newspaper] The municipal government's budget expenditures for the second half of the 35th year (1946): The administrative part accounts for 14.4% of the total budget expenditures, totaling 13.2 billion. The operational part accounts for 85.6% of the total budget, totaling 71 billion.

The regular expenses of the administrative part, including salaries and office expenses for the municipal government and various bureaus, total 1.2 billion, plus living allowances, totaling 9.5 billion. As for the regular expenses of the operational part, they are the salaries of personnel handling various businesses, such as teachers and staff in various schools, workers in various district public works offices and factories, various health centers, various relief homes, and various police substations, totaling 4.7 billion, plus living allowances of 36.3 billion, totaling 41 billion.

The temporary expenses of the administrative part are the purchase and repair expenses of the municipal government and various bureaus, such as printing, furniture, gasoline consumption, house and vehicle repairs, advertising, training, etc., totaling 3.7 billion. The temporary expenses of the operational part are the materials and tools needed to conduct various businesses, such as adding class equipment to municipal schools and subsidizing private schools, maintaining roads, building new roads, adding street lights, opening civilian hospitals, running cleaning stations, subsidizing free hospital beds in municipal hospitals, police winter uniforms, printing costs, etc., totaling 30 billion.

### Councilors' Representatives Gathered Yesterday to Discuss Participating in the Takeover and Investigation Team

[Our Newspaper] The five representatives of the City Council who will participate in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Takeover Work Investigation Team received appointment letters yesterday, inviting them to participate in the work of the first group of the team (i.e., the investigation related to the Shanghai-Hangzhou area). They were also invited to attend the team's routine meeting at the Jiangsu Supervisory Office at 10:00 AM tomorrow (the 18th). The council representatives were convened by Zhao Junhao yesterday to discuss preliminary measures for participating in the investigation work.

### Housing Allocation Subject to Criticism; Illegal Seizures Should Be Sanctioned; Demanding the Executive Yuan to Come Up With a Solution; Councilors' Interrogations Stirred Up Emotions

Councilors' interrogations regarding the Housing Allocation Committee were very heated. Eleven speakers, including Lu Huimin, Qu Yue, and Lu Yinchu, raised several points in their inquiries:

(1) The report's content is too vague, and the figures are not detailed enough. What is the total number of houses seized from the enemy that the Housing Allocation Committee received, and where are they located? A detailed disclosure is required.

(2) There are many unfair situations in the already allocated houses. Some individuals have been allocated two or three houses and are selling them for gold bars, while many public education agencies cannot be allocated any houses at all. What are the standards that the Allocation Committee is using? The names of the agencies and individuals that have been allocated houses must be made public.

(3) Illegal seizures are not only a disregard for the law, but also a national disgrace. This phenomenon must be corrected. The Allocation Committee should publish the names of those seizing agencies in detail in the newspaper and use the power of public opinion to sanction them.

(4) The government must issue a law that must be enforced. The Housing Allocation Measures are stipulated by the Executive Yuan. The Executive Yuan is the highest executive agency. If the laws and regulations it sets cannot be enforced, who else can enforce them? In fact, the original measures do have inappropriate aspects and should be revised or new measures should be formulated.

Chen Peide specifically raised the issue of Xie Jinyuan's widow's residence. He said that the government had long issued a clear order that the families of martyrs should have houses to live in. Why hasn't she been allocated one yet?

Zhang Zhihan believes that relying solely on the power of public opinion is not enough to stop the trend of seizures. He advocates that the council organize an agency with the support of all citizens to strengthen the work of housing allocation.

Wang Jian'e raised specific facts, saying that the district office needs a place to work, and there are three houses in the district: one is occupied by Zha Liangjian, one is used by the Security Department's Detective Team, and one is used by the Military Police. When he asked the Allocation Committee, the reply was that they were already occupied, so don't think about them anymore. He wants to ask: What exactly does "allocation" mean?

### Continuing Budget Review: The Ninth Group Held Its Fourth Meeting Yesterday; Heads of Various Bureaus Attended and Reported Separately

The City Council held review meetings simultaneously in ten groups yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. The ninth group was the most important because it continued to review the municipal government's new budget for the second half of the year. The ninth group held its fourth meeting yesterday, and various bureaus continued to report on their financial revenues and expenditures and budgets. In addition to oral reports, written materials were submitted to the council for reference. Attendees included the municipal government's accountant, heads of various bureaus, and accounting directors, totaling more than ten people. The meeting was presided over by Xu Yongzuo, the convener of the group. Councilors raised questions about any unclear or insufficiently detailed points in the reports of various bureaus, and the responsible bureaus supplemented their explanations.

Public Utilities

First, Zhao Huijue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, reported on the bureau's total budget for the second half of the year, totaling 4.3 billion yuan, of which regular administrative management expenses accounted for 16% of the total budget, operating expenses accounted for 62%, and subsidies for operating expenses accounted for 11%. Then, the affiliated agencies reported on the operating revenue and expenditure budget for the second half of the year for the Public Bus Preparatory Office. The revenue was 3.6 billion yuan, equal to the expenditure. Expansion expenses were 2.2 billion yuan, part of which was a loan and part of which was subsidized by the municipal government. The Pudong Water Company's operating revenue was 5.85 million yuan, the water supply station 3.93 million yuan, and the ship water supply 3.28 million yuan. On the expenditure side: personnel and vehicle expenses were approximately 8 million yuan, start-up costs were 2 million yuan, chemical testing fees were 2 million yuan, and miscellaneous expenses were 2 million yuan. The Municipal Ferry Management Office's operating revenue was 1 billion yuan, offsetting the expenses, and the expenditure on improved assets after increased construction was 300 million yuan. The Wusong Coal Gas Plant's operating revenue was 740 million yuan, offsetting the expenses, and the expansion expenses were 1.3 billion yuan, which is expected to be completed within one year.

Police

Next, Yu Shuping, Deputy Director of the Police Bureau, reported. Yu said that the police bureau's budget was compiled based on the bureau's regular operations, as the bureau's work should be to consolidate public security, prohibit opium, manage traffic, rectify customs, organize the city appearance, and strengthen fire protection. The staffing was determined based on the importance of various tasks. According to the staffing, the total number of people was 20,000, and the current number was 13,000, a ratio of 1 to 300 to the citizens. Yu then analyzed the various fee categories and needs of the new budget and cited examples comparing them with the police expenses of the former concessions. "In the past, police expenses in the concessions accounted for 50% of the annual expenditure, and fire protection fees were an additional 4%, for a total of 54%, while according to the current new budget, it only accounts for 22% of the annual expenditure," he said.

Social Affairs

Li Jianhua, Deputy Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, reported that the bureau's budget for the second half of the year should be its minimum limit, such as the winter relief fund of only 35 million yuan, and the three public memorial ceremonies of only 3 million yuan. Other items include 30 million yuan for purchasing, repairing, and printing expenses, 14 million yuan for business and guidance operating expenses, 900,000 yuan for agricultural and forestry expansion guidance expenses, 1 million yuan for company and factory investigation guidance expenses, 1 million yuan for other investigation guidance expenses, 5 million yuan for small loan loss expenses, and 15 million yuan for relief business subsidy expenses.

Health

Zhang Wei, Director of the Health Bureau, reported that the funding for the second half of the year only increased by one time compared to the first half of the year. The plan is to achieve 70% technology and 30% administration. The total budget for the Health Bureau in the second half of the year is 13.6 billion yuan, of which administrative expenses account for 3.4%, and business management expenses account for 95.6%, including medical and equipment expenses accounting for 34.9%, environmental health accounting for 46.8%, health care expenses accounting for 12.7%, and epidemic prevention expenses accounting for 5.6%.

Education

Li Ximou, Deputy Director of the Education Bureau, reported that the total budget for the second half of the year is 16.2 billion yuan, 1.3 billion yuan for adding classes and starting expenses, more than 550 million yuan for supplementary equipment for municipal schools and institutions, 300 million yuan for board expenses for normal school students, 1 billion yuan for subsidies to private schools and institutions, and only 25 million yuan for administrative affairs. At the same time, the Civil Affairs Office also submitted a written report.

After the reports were completed, the councilors briefly expressed their opinions and adjourned the meeting, and decided to hold another closed-door review meeting tonight, and the heads of various bureaus were still invited to attend.

### Regarding Public Utilities and Public Works

The fifth review committee had about 80 proposals related to public utilities and public works, so at the third review meeting yesterday, it was passed to merge all the proposals into 20 major cases. Two cases were discussed yesterday:

Unify Transportation Routes, Improve Traffic

(1) Regarding unifying tram and bus routes, increasing vehicles, improving traffic, and training staff, it is proposed that the Public Utilities Bureau be instructed to urge the relevant companies to implement it conscientiously. It was discussed by merging eight cases. After the review, four points were initially resolved: (1) Public utilities should be operated by private companies in principle. (2) The China Merchant Electricity Company should be quickly restored and protected. (3) Public buses should also be handled according to the first principle. (4) The methods discussed in the relevant proposals should be compiled by the secretary and sent to the Public Utilities Bureau for reference.

Restricting Electricity Use, Discontinuing Electric Heating

(2) Regarding the proposal to request the municipal government to restrict electricity consumption, it was reviewed by merging seven cases. As a result, the following was initially resolved: (1) To restrict electricity consumption for heating, it is proposed that the power company not be allowed to provide electric heating again this winter. The French Power Company will resume connecting electricity next month, which should be canceled. According to Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, if electric heating is stopped, 20,000 kilowatts can be saved, so the city's electricity will no longer need to be worried about. (2) Restricting electricity use should be based on the electricity consumption record of February of this year. For newly installed electricity users, it should be based on the electricity consumption record of August. Those who violate the regulations three times should be severely punished. Detailed measures will be formulated by the Public Utilities Bureau. (3) Military electricity should be charged to show restriction. It is proposed that the municipal government submit a request to the Ministry of National Defense to issue an order to the military to pay for the lamp oil fees for electricity use.

### Soldiers Who Seize Houses Will Be Severely Punished According to Military Law; They Must All Evacuate Before the End of the Month

When the Songhu Garrison Headquarters held a week of fasting yesterday morning, Commander Xuan made an important report on the matter of soldiers seizing houses, stating that he had just received a telegram from Chairman Chiang, ordering that soldiers who illegally seize houses must immediately evacuate voluntarily. If it is verified, they will be severely punished according to military law. Xuan also stated that those who seize houses must evacuate before the end of the month, and those who fail to do so will be dealt with according to military law. Xuan will also convene a meeting of army, navy, and air force generals in the coming days.

### Organizing an Observation Group to Investigate Foreign Education; Li Ximou Submitted a Proposal to Use the Education Bureau's Stipulated Subsidy for Private Schools to Supplement Free Quotas

The sixth review committee reviewed proposals related to education and culture, with Zhou Feicheng as chairman. First, similar proposals were merged and divided into more than twenty categories, such as increasing municipal primary schools, subsidizing private primary and secondary schools, increasing public schools, vocational schools, normal schools, and increasing teacher salaries.

Regarding the education budget, the municipal government stipulates that it accounts for 19.7% of the total budget. All members of this group believe that it should be increased, otherwise, educational construction cannot be started. Increasing it to 30% is the most ideal, and it should at least account for 25%.

There were 19 proposals related to increasing municipal primary schools, and two review committee members were assigned to sort them out. Due to time constraints, they were not reviewed.

Yesterday's main review work was related to the issue of tuition fees for private schools. Recently, councilors have strongly criticized the unrestricted tuition fees of private schools, so the committee members were very cautious when reviewing this case. Finally, the following review opinion was passed: "The tuition fees for private primary and secondary schools should be requested by the municipal government to be stipulated according to the price situation at that time, and detailed standards for use and distribution should be established and strictly supervised. Those who deliberately violate them should be punished."

Several private school principals who attended this group's review gave explanations on the tuition fees of private schools. They all believe that if they want to strengthen the teaching staff and develop education, the current tuition fees cannot be said to be too high. Li Ximou, Deputy Director of the Education Bureau, was also present and proposed that in addition to strictly stipulating a 20% free quota, the private school subsidy stipulated by the Education Bureau should be used to supplement the number of free places. The committee members also decided to report the situation of tuition fees in private schools at the general meeting and detail the difficulties.

As for the teacher respect fee, it has been decided to propose that it should not be collected at all levels of primary and secondary schools starting from the next semester. Regarding the case where teachers in various schools who have worked for ten years should be given one year of rest, with salaries and benefits paid as usual, it is proposed that the municipal government should implement it conscientiously.

The Education Bureau submitted a proposal to send an education observation group to investigate education abroad to serve as a reference for the restoration of the city's education. After review, the following method was decided: The Education Bureau should hire those who have contributed to the city's education and culture and those who have served in the city's education sector for more than ten years and have achieved outstanding results to form a foreign observation group.

Finally, it was decided to make a resolution on the Education Bureau's work report, and Huang Shijin, Chen Baotai, and Wang Liben were responsible for drafting it.

### Reviewing Finance and Land Administration: Preliminary Resolutions on Important Cases

The third group reviewed finance and land administration proposals and held its third meeting yesterday. Excerpts of the preliminary resolutions are recorded as follows: (1) The case of not increasing rents was sent to the municipal government for consideration. (2) The practice of cracking down on second landlords' extra demands and malpractices should be strictly prohibited by the municipal government, and the municipal government should formulate measures for conscientious implementation. (3) The construction of affordable housing was sent to the municipal government for consideration. (4) The housing lease dispute case will be jointly discussed with the tenth group's Legislative Committee. (5) The case of investigating and clarifying wasteland and public property in the urban area for utilization was not passed and should be resubmitted with a real estate management method for approval. (6) The original tenant of a house has the right of first refusal to lease, but the landlord may refuse to renew the lease if there is a violation of the regulations (the method will be announced after being passed by the general meeting). (7) Stopping the collection of defense corps uniform fees and exempting the book industry from business tax have been sent to the municipal government to be handled by the Finance Bureau. (8) Returning civilian land occupied by the enemy and puppets should be handled quickly and conscientiously by the municipal government. (9) Dividing shared land to avoid disputes should be handled by the Land Administration Bureau.

### The Housing Lease Management Committee Has Numerous Malpractices in Arbitration; The Tenth Group's Review of Regulations Sparked FierCE Debate; Three Principles Were Decided: Arbitration Should Adopt a Collegial System

The tenth review committee was responsible for reviewing legislative proposals. The Housing Lease Management Committee regulations were discussed yesterday. The committee members present were Tao Baichuan, Ma Junshuo, Chen Cunren, Jiang Pingfan, Zhu Yakui, Yan Esheng, Zhu Fojiu, Wu Zhengxiao, Li Wenjie, Fan CaiKui, and Yu Chuanding. Zhu Ping, Director of the Land Administration Bureau, and Wu Zunyi, Chief Secretary of the Housing Lease Management Committee, were also present, ready to provide explanations at any time for reference during the review. Wu Zhengxiao, Zhu Yakui, and Yu Chuanding were the first to speak, pointing out that the internal structure of the Housing Lease Management Committee was too unsound, and there were numerous malpractices in arbitrating disputes. Moreover, after mediation by the committee, disputes not only could not be resolved, but also led to litigation. However, the courts did not pay attention to such civil lawsuits and often dragged on for six months or a year. In addition, the decisions of the Housing Lease Management Committee could not be enforced and were often overturned by the courts. Therefore, the committee has no credibility and is in name only. The parties involved in the dispute have great doubts about the fairness of the committee's decisions, so the committee should strengthen its organization to make itself sound. Senator Ma Junshuo continued to say: The Housing Lease Management Committee was established according to Article 23 of the Wartime Lease Regulations, but Article 24 of the regulations stated that the regulations would expire six months after the war. The committee has lost its legal basis, so the revision of the Housing Lease Management Regulations and the handling of dispute methods should be discussed carefully. Furthermore, the committee's rulings on housing disputes conflict with the courts. If the existence of this institution is still needed in the city, the legal aspect must be considered first, and it is recommended that the central government complete the legislative process in the future. Senator Ma also said that the committee's past mediation was too hasty, and it was done solely by the section chief or commissioner, resulting in many malpractices. If arbitration is still needed in the future, a collegial system must be adopted. Yan Esheng raised the question of whether the committee needs to continue to exist because it is a matter for administrative agencies. Therefore, Senator Tao Baichuan asked the third group, and learned that the third group's review opinion was that housing disputes can first be mediated by the district office, and if mediation fails, then the lease management committee will arbitrate. Senator Yan believed that since the third group had already decided this way, this case could be temporarily retained and decided after a joint review with the third group. Senator Ma believed that this was purely a legal basis issue, and the tenth group could not give up. Senator Zhu Fojiu said that the City Council has the right of initiative. If necessary, it can create a separate special law, and then, with the chairman's approval or through the legislative process, it can be applied with priority. Therefore, the first decision is whether it needs to exist. Senator Ma said that the nature of the city's separate laws belongs to orders, and orders must not conflict with central laws. Therefore, whether the committee continues to exist must first be determined by whether it has a legal basis and whether its rules and regulations conflict with the law. Senators Ma and Zhu quoted extensively and debated for a long time. Later, Director Zhu Ping stood up and stated that there are still many housing disputes in the city, and the committee is still needed in fact. If there is no problem with the abolition, the regulations can be discussed. Because it was late, three principles were set first, and other issues will be decided after a joint review and discussion with the third group. The three principles are (1) The mediation of the district office can be decided by the parties to the dispute themselves. (2) Arbitration shall adopt a five-person collegial system: one person from the municipal government, the court, and the police bureau, and two impartial local persons. The local impartial persons shall be proposed by the Mountain Council with a considerable number, and the chairman shall draw lots to decide two persons temporarily. (3) The revised draft shall be drafted by the Housing Lease Management Committee itself.

### Regarding Police Security

The Second Review Committee. Yesterday afternoon, they reviewed proposals related to police security, dividing them into four major categories: 1. Volunteer police, self-defense forces, and security corps issues. 2. Firefighting work issues. 3. Issues related to improving police efficiency. 4. Matters that the police bureau should establish and implement. During the review of each proposal, Mr. Jiang Huaisu expressed the most opinions.

At the beginning of the city's victory, there was an original organization of security corps, but it was later abolished because the central government issued a clear order to abolish security corps in various places. All committee members believed that there was no need to restore it. As for the volunteer police, they were established in accordance with central laws and regulations to supplement the inadequacy of the police, which was definitely needed and should be strengthened. With winter defense approaching, the security work in the suburban security areas of the city is particularly important. To supplement the lack of police force, self-defense forces should be organized. This is a major focus of civil affairs work and has a legal basis. The committee members concluded that the security corps need not be restored, the volunteer police should be retained, and self-defense forces should be organized separately.

Firefighting work is related to the safety of citizens and should be strictly inspected. The ethics of firefighters is even more important and cannot be ignored. However, there is no firefighting item in this year's municipal budget. After a joint review by the committees, it was believed that the municipal government should be requested to stipulate a firefighting budget, strengthen firefighting equipment, and improve the work efficiency of firefighters.

Regarding the proposal to improve police efficiency, the review committee members believed that it is necessary to thoroughly eliminate the legacy of the former patrol rooms and establish a new police model. The police serve the people and should be polite to the common people. To improve the quality of police officers, it is stipulated that they must be junior high school graduates, and the treatment of police officers should be increased, with the lowest grade paid by appointment.

As for the matters that the police bureau should establish and reform, the most important and urgent matters are divided into three categories: investigating and banning private prostitutes and opium. Strengthening traffic control and eliminating pickpockets and petty thieves. All were approved in principle and the municipal government was requested to handle them separately.

### Celebrating the Supreme Leader's Sixtieth Birthday; Mobilizing the Public to Prepare an Organization

The Seventh Review Committee. Yesterday, the review of proposals on social relief and labor was held, with a total of eleven people attending. Chairman Tang Shichang decided on the review method, and summarized all the proposals into fourteen categories. The conveners will prepare preliminary review opinions and submit them to the next review meeting for final decision. The proposal to prepare for the Chairman's Sixtieth Birthday celebration was also reviewed and passed. Because Speaker Pan and 39 others believe that since the Chairman launched the Northern Expedition, he has been working diligently day and night. This year coincides with the Chairman's sixtieth birthday, so they specially proposed to the Municipal Council to mobilize public groups to organize a preparatory committee to celebrate the Supreme Leader's sixtieth birthday and establish a permanent memorial to show respect for virtue and reward merit.

The fourteen categories of proposals are listed below: 1. Suppressing and stabilizing prices and rationing issues (4 items). 2. Labor-management issues (3 items). 3. Social welfare issues (1 item). 4. Relief issues (7 items). 5. Labor compulsory service (1 item). 6. Promoting the New Life Movement (3 items). 7. Farmers' welfare issues (2 items). 8. Cooperative enterprises (2 items). 9. Unemployment issues (3 items). 10. Women and children relief issues (4 items and 1 temporary motion). 11. Compensation for war losses and relief issues (1 item). 12. Labor welfare (9 items). 13. Implementation issues of the resolutions of the Provisional Council (2 items). 14. Petition from workers in the hotel industry (1 item).

### A Solemn Appeal at the Council Meeting; Requesting the Recovery of Hong Kong, Kowloon, and Macau; The Owner of Hardoon Garden Has Agreed to Turn it into a Park

The last item on the agenda of the general meeting was to discuss several temporary motions.

Zhou Feicheng and more than 20 others jointly proposed that the municipal government contact the owner to lease Hardoon Garden and open it as a park for citizens to relax. The discussion concluded that because the Public Works Bureau had already contacted this matter and the owner had also expressed his consent, it was decided to hand it over to the Fifth Review Subcommittee for discussion.

The mayor submitted a proposal to extend daylight saving time to the end of October to save electricity, but the councilors strongly opposed it. The reason is that the time is near the Frost's Descent, and if daylight saving time is extended again, electricity may not be saved, but there will be many inconveniences for daily life and work. Feng Youzhen specifically mentioned the impact of daylight saving time on the morning newspaper publication time of the news industry. Finally, it was decided that this case would not be approved, and how to save electricity would be handed over to the Fifth Subcommittee for review.

The review of the municipal government's policy report was resolved to be jointly responsible by the conveners of each group.

The finale is often the most exciting. Wang Xianqing shouted out the call to "recover Hong Kong" in a solemn tone. He said: "Today there is a piece of news in the newspaper saying that the Hong Kong government spokesman does not recognize Kowloon City as Chinese territory. From Kowloon to Hong Kong, the phenomenon of Shanghai funds fleeing to Hong Kong is very serious. Recently, the Hong Kong dollar has risen, which has also stimulated the Shanghai market. Moreover, Hong Kong is a base for smuggling and tax evasion of foreign goods, which is an alarming economic loophole. Hong Kong residents are all Chinese citizens, and we should petition the national government to quickly negotiate and recover Hong Kong."

Councilors enthusiastically responded to his proposal and further mentioned another "tumor," Macau, and other places occupied such as Xinjiang, Mongolia, and Tibet, all of which should be recovered. Finally, the speaker summarized the opinions and decided to petition the national government to actively negotiate the recovery of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Macau, and other lands ceded or leased by unequal treaties, in order to benefit the integrity of the territory.

### Preliminary Completion of the Review of Health Work

The Eighth Review Committee yesterday reviewed about 40 proposals related to the Health Bureau. More than 20 committee members attended, chaired by Pang Jingzhou. Because there were too many proposals and the content was mostly the same, in order to save time and facilitate review and discussion, they were first classified into three major categories: (1) related to hospitals, doctors, and public health; (2) related to fecal matter issues; (3) related to garbage removal and other issues. After all the proposals were read out by Councilor Pang, they were categorized according to their content. Therefore, the 40 proposals were cleared in less than an hour, and Councilors Fan Shouyuan, Chen Cunren, and Cen Zhiliang were publicly elected to be responsible for organizing and modifying the proposals (proposals with similar content were merged and the proposal title was changed), and compiling methods to facilitate discussion at the general meeting. The group's review work has now been initially completed.

### Suggesting the Central Government Adopt a Cash Guarantee System

The Fourth Review Committee held its second meeting yesterday at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The committee members Wang Xianqing, He Chengfu, Hong Fumei, Zhou Lianze, Huang Zhenshi, Yao Baozhen and others attended. The meeting was still chaired by Wang Xianqing. Two proposals were reviewed: The first proposal suggested that the central government abolish the current employee guarantee method and adopt the "Special Cash Guarantee System" that has been effectively tested by the Guangdong Provincial Bank, ordering government financial institutions to implement it as soon as possible in order to eliminate corruption cases and establish a sound guarantee system.

Wang Xianqing reported on the advantages of the cash guarantee system: (1) mutual supervision; (2) increasing savings; (3) due to the payment of the guarantee deposit, it has the effect of recovering legal currency; (4) it can also solve the difficulty of not being able to find a guarantor with a better reputation. Subsequently, other committee members expressed their opinions. The final review opinion was to submit it to the general meeting for approval. However, regarding the detailed methods and clauses of the system, it was proposed that Zhou Lianze conduct further research. The second proposal was the eight proposals submitted by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce in an official letter. The review opinion was to submit it to the general meeting for approval and recommend it to the Central Bank.

### Tian Tiefu Obtained by the High Procuratorate

[Our Newspaper] Tian Tiefu, the commander of the 34th Division of the Pseudo First Front Army, was recently arrested in Shanghai by the Songhu Garrison Command. Yesterday, he was transferred to the High Procuratorate for investigation.

### Solving Electricity Shortage; Planning to Purchase a Generator Ship

Shanghai Electric Power Company is currently consulting with relevant authorities to plan to order a generator ship from the United States to alleviate the current electricity shortage.

### Horse Racing Issue; Opinions Are Still; Three Three Two Two

[Our Newspaper] The horse racing proposal sparked a heated discussion again yesterday at the meeting of the Third Group Review Committee on Finance and Land Administration. Councilor Chen Cunren, who is familiar with the history of the racecourse, put forward three opinions: (1) Horse racing exists in any international metropolis and cannot be regarded as a kind of gambling, but it cannot be run in the most crowded area, and should be held in the suburbs; (2) Collecting taxes or ordering relocation according to the Land Law is costly, but the property rights of the racecourse are worth studying, so it is hoped that a problem research committee can be organized to study the racecourse clauses in detail and then make a decision; (3) The "Problem Research Committee" should use the method of the Greater Shanghai Bond Raising Research Committee as a reference and provide a separate recovery method for discussion by the next review committee. Later, Wang Jian'e raised a fundamental question. He said: "The Mayor's submission said that 'regarding horse racing, we must first ask whether it is purely horse racing or involves selling lottery tickets? If lottery tickets are sold, we can ask the municipal government to submit it to the Judicial Yuan to ask whether it is gambling according to Article 266 of the Criminal Law. If it conflicts with central laws and regulations, this case does not need to be discussed at all. ' "However, the opinions of the councilors were still mixed, and the more they discussed, the less clear they became. The scope was too large, and the result was still a decision to discuss it at the next review meeting.

### Hangzhou's Major Theft Case Solved; Fang Zhengyuan is the Manager of the Pawnshop; The Victims are All Senior Officials and Celebrities

[Our Newspaper] Since last winter, no less than 20 "night theft" cases have occurred continuously in Hangzhou, but the targets of the thieves are all senior officials in the military and political circles, as well as lawyers and celebrities in the banking and business circles. For example, Shangguan Yunxiang, Deputy Commander of the Third War Zone Command, Xuan Tiewu's Hangzhou residence, Commander of the Songhu Garrison, Jin Runquan, President of the Bank of China, Chen Yanru, Councilor of the Third War Zone Command, Hu Xiwu, Director of the Investigation Office of the Zhejiang Provincial Security Command, lawyers Ye Wei, Zhao Jianxin, and others, all lost gold, silver, jewelry, coral, agate, gold watches, and diamond rings. Among them, Shangguan Yunxiang's residence was stolen of more than 4 million yuan in cash, and Commander Xuan's residence was stolen of sable coats, gray coats, fox coats, and coral Buddha hand jade bracelets. In addition, the Commercial Press, Shulianji Fan Shop, Baja Leather Shoe Store, Yanling Printing Factory, Hengsheng Paint Store, and Pan Wenbin, nephew of Division Commander Pan Guogang, Zhang Huchen, Technical Officer of the Public Works Bureau, Wang Sudan, etc., were all victims.

According to the confession, the main culprit Fang Zhengyuan, the general manager of Shanghai Jifeng Pawnshop, was apprehended. According to Fang's confession, a part of the stolen goods was in his house at 314 Fuxing Middle Road in Shanghai. Therefore, the Hangzhou Police Bureau ordered Detective Ye Jianzhong to come to Shanghai with Fang under escort yesterday morning with official documents. Together with the police of the Taishan Branch, they secretly went to Fang's residence, arrested Fang's wife, Qiu (from Hubei, 36 years old), and his son, Guobin (19 years old), and seized a large suitcase of stolen goods such as "silver-clad gold" ornaments. It was then learned that another major criminal in the case was hiding at 52 Huangpi Road, so they went again and arrested Xiong Chuan and Zhang Xingwu (both from Hubei). The suspects and stolen goods were detained in the police station, awaiting escort back to Hangzhou for investigation.

### US Military Tribunal Tries German War Criminals; No Infringement on Chinese Sovereignty; Prosecutor Sternly Refutes Defense Lawyer's Argument; Intense Dispute Over Whether to be Restricted by the German Surrender Instrument

[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, when the US military tribunal tried the German "Ehard Special Service Bureau" war criminals, defense lawyer Yang Linzhi launched a fierce attack in court, saying that the trial was illegal. Lawyer Yang said: Before the Judicial Yuan officially expresses its consent, even if there is an agreement between the US and Chinese governments, it cannot take effect. Therefore, the US military has no right to try these 23 German expatriates at all. He also claimed that, to his knowledge, the Judicial Yuan had never formally expressed its consent on this matter. Yang also cited the words of former US President Roosevelt, saying that the principle of trying war criminals should be that war criminals should be tried by the free government of the place where they committed the crime. Yang said: Germans had lost their consular jurisdiction in 1924 and had since been subject to Chinese law. However, Yang said that he did not object to the US military trying Japanese war criminals.

Lawyer Jiang Yiping, who defended defendant Baron Pugaman, also joined Yang's protest. After reciting the US military's regulations on the trial of war criminals one by one, he said that the defendant had not committed any of the items in these regulations.

German and Japanese are One and Indivisible

At this point, the chief prosecutor of the military tribunal, Major O'Connor, refuted, saying that the German expatriates protected by Chinese law refer to ordinary merchants and civilians, not those who come to China as enemies of China. He said that the defendants were all war criminals arrested in the war zone, which is different from ordinary criminals. O'Connor also said: The US military is stationed in China, having fulfilled its due obligations, and should also enjoy certain privileges. In response to Yang's claim that the US military came to China purely to defeat the Japanese army, O'Connor retorted that Germany and Japan were one and indivisible. The decision to try the defendants was originally to maintain world peace, that is, to ensure that there would be no third world war.

In response to Yang's claim that the trial of war criminals was an infringement of Chinese sovereignty and had aroused resentment among the Chinese people, O'Connor retorted that if the United States and China were to switch places, the United States would be very willing for Chinese military tribunals to try war criminals in the United States. The establishment of this US military tribunal was with the full consent of the Chinese government, and no protest from the Chinese government has been heard since the trial of Japanese war criminals. He said: If the Chinese army is also invited to the United States by the US government, as the Chinese government is doing to the US military now, if the Chinese troops stationed in the United States want to try war criminals, not only will it not arouse resentment from the American people, but it will definitely arouse the support of the American people.

Four Suspects Arrested in Peiping

O'Connor denied the claim of the defendant's defense lawyer that the US military was dissatisfied with the Chinese military tribunal, but said that he himself had heard that the Chinese military tribunal lacked talents, and suggested that Lawyer Yang, who is eloquent and eloquent, might as well show his talents in the Chinese military tribunal.

In response to Yang's claim that the defendants were overseas Chinese living in China and should be protected by Chinese law, O'Connor retorted that they were all enemies of the United States and China and could not be compared with ordinary overseas Chinese. Moreover, it was the puppet government presided over by Wang Jingwei who recognized them as official overseas Chinese.

Another defense attorney argued for the release of the defendants because they were not under the jurisdiction of the German Commander-in-Chief and therefore should not be restricted by the German instrument of surrender. The dispute was fierce, and it was not concluded until the adjournment. The hearing is scheduled to continue at 8:00 a.m. on Tuesday.

At the opening of the court yesterday, O'Connor announced that four more suspects in the case had been arrested in Beiping. They are currently detained in Chinese military institutions and will be transferred to justice soon.

### Teenager Falls Victim to Scam When Buying Radio

[Our Newspaper] Liang Shixun, a 24-year-old from Guangdong, does coal business. On the 5th of this month, he opened a room at No. 322 Yuandong Hotel on Tibet Road and met two Westerners. The two Westerners used the sale of radios as a reason to lure him in. Liang was fooled. At 11:00 p.m. on the 15th, he went to the room opened by the Westerners at No. 512 of the hotel, paid 500,000 in cash, and agreed to pay the remaining 100,000 on the 16th to take delivery of the goods. At 10:00 a.m. yesterday, Liang sent the remaining 100,000 yuan to the Westerners because the appointment had expired. After one of the Westerners received the money, he falsely claimed that he would go to Hongkou to pick up the goods together. When they arrived at the entrance of a lane on Wuchang Road, the Westerner asked him to wait a moment. After more than an hour, he did not see him return. Liang knew he had been deceived and rushed back to report the situation to the Laozha Branch, requesting investigation. The police bureau learned that the two Westerners were indeed unemployed vagrants who lived by fraud. They are now being strictly arrested and brought to justice.

### Severe Sentence in the Case of Chopping Husband and Dismembering Body: Zhan Zhou Still Sentenced to Death · The Defendant's Only Defense Was Lack of Premeditation · High Court Opened Trial Yesterday Afternoon and Concluded in One Hearing ·

[Report from Our Newspaper] The sensational Jiangyuan Lane blood case in Shanghai during the enemy-puppet period – Zhan Zhou chopped her husband Zhan Yunying, and afterwards dismembered the body into sixteen pieces, packed them into a box, and attempted to destroy the evidence. The crime was discovered by the second landlord, Wang Xieyang, who reported it to the police. The female criminal Zhan Zhou was sentenced to death by the puppet court at the time. (Photo of Zhan Zhou taken by China Press during the hearing) The defendant refused to accept the sentence and was appealing to the puppet supreme court. Victory came, and the judgment was declared invalid, so the Municipal High Procuratorate re-investigated and prosecuted. Yesterday at 2:30 PM, the trial opened at the High Court on North Zhejiang Road, and it was concluded in one hearing. The defendant was immediately sentenced to death again.

(Before the Trial) Zhan Zhou submitted a petition to the High Court, requesting the revocation of the original judgment of the pseudo-first instance and a reduced sentence in accordance with Articles 273, 249, and 57 of the Criminal Law. The appeal was drafted by pro bono defense lawyers Chen Xia and Shi Baixiu, and the main points, facts, and reasons for the appeal are as follows.

(Main Points): The occurrence of this case was out of righteous indignation. It was a temporary motive in a state of confusion, without deep thought or premeditation. The original trial mistakenly regarded the purchase of a kitchen knife as definite proof of premeditation. The dismemberment was a cruel act. The severe sentence of death is difficult to accept.

(Facts): After marrying Zhan Yunying, although he was violent and quarrelsome, she could still endure it. Since the fall of Shanghai, he became addicted to gambling and neglected his proper business. He also opened an escort agency, colluding with the enemy and puppets day and night, enticing respectable men and women, and harming public morals. He refused to care for the family's livelihood, returning home once or twice a month, always after midnight (with enemy-puppet passes), and sweeping away pledges whenever he left. Any slight persuasion would result in violent beatings. In October of the 33rd year [of the Republic], feeling that life was meaningless, she swallowed Lysol and attempted suicide to end her life. Fortunately, she was discovered by a female tenant living on the terrace and rushed to Hongren Hospital on Xinzha Road for emergency treatment and survived. Ten days later, she was discharged from the hospital. Although her husband knew this, he did not show any compassion and abandoned her as before, making life even more difficult. She invited neighbors to gather and help fund her efforts, selling stewed pork and other items on the street to make ends meet. So, she bought a kitchen knife, cutting board, and bamboo basket, intending to start a business. However, her husband found out when he returned home at night and stole the working capital, causing her plans to fail. She then earned a living by embroidering and sewing for others. On the morning of March 20 of the 34th year [of the Republic], her husband returned at 3 AM. They argued and fought for about two hours, then fell asleep from exhaustion. She awoke from a nightmare at dawn. After urinating in a daze, she saw a kitchen knife nearby. Suddenly, she felt that her husband was harming the country and the people, so she acted on impulse and cut off his head. Realizing the enormity of her crime, she dismembered the body and packed it into a box, intending to carry it out and discard it. However, she sat blankly on the bed, unsure of what to do. The second landlord, Wang Xieyang, saw blood flowing downstairs, discovered the crime, and reported it to the police. This is the fact of the case.

(Reasons): The appellant’s husband opened an escort agency and colluded with the enemy and puppets, harming the country and the people. It was a temporary act of righteous indignation and intolerable provocation that led to the murder of her husband. Although the law is unforgiving, the circumstances are pitiable. According to Article 284, Section 1, Item 1 of the old Criminal Law, premeditation is required to constitute the crime of murder. Therefore, the act of killing must be based on the result of deep deliberation, and there must be a definite plan before implementation. If the intent to kill is decided on the spur of the moment, even if there is a long-standing feud, it is only a distant cause of the intent to kill and cannot be equated with intentional homicide. Therefore, it is inappropriate to impose the penalty for murder (see Precedent No. 2097, Shang Zi, 21st Year). This case was indeed a temporary decision, without any premeditation. The original judgment was based solely on conjecture to create a case of premeditated murder, which is not in accordance with legal principles. Furthermore, the dismemberment was to destroy evidence and cannot be compared to cruel acts such as heart-ripping or abdominal incision. Therefore, it only constitutes the crime under Article 249, Section 1, and Article 273 of the Criminal Law. The motive and purpose of the crime were decided on the spur of the moment, without deep deliberation or premeditation. The repeated provocations suffered by the appellant were intolerable for a weak woman, causing her to react impulsively. There was no other deliberate intention. Her difficult living conditions and lack of education are all in accordance with the provisions of Article 57 of the Criminal Law for mitigation. She humbly requests that she be granted leniency and a lighter sentence, which would be a great act of kindness.

(Zhou) is currently detained in the Women's Prison of the Shanghai Prison in Tilanqiao. Before the court session yesterday, she was specially brought to the High Court on North Zhejiang Road, wearing a blue cloth short shirt and trousers prisoner's uniform, with a white number [226] embroidered on her chest, and gray cloth closed-toe shoes on her bare feet. Her original long hair had been cut to ear length. She was short and had a pale face. At that time, the courtroom was crowded with spectators, mostly housewives. At 2:30 PM, Judge Zhang Qinglan, along with Judges Wang Kequan and Zhu Chengzan, Prosecutor Jiang Gongliang, and clerks, arrived and took their seats. They immediately ordered the bailiffs to bring up Zhan Zhou. They first asked her age, native place, and address. She replied: 31 years old, Danyang native, residing at No. 85, Lane 432, Xinchang Road, Jiangyuan Lane. After the prosecutor read out the indictment, the questioning began. Judge: Did you kill your husband at 3 AM on the night of March 20, 34th year? Answer: It was at dawn. I suddenly woke up and got up to urinate. I saw a knife in the drawer of a small cabinet next to the toilet, and I took the knife and killed him. Judge: Was your husband asleep or awake at this time? Answer: Awake. Judge: Was he sleeping facing in, facing out, on his back, or on his stomach? Answer: I don't remember clearly. Judge: Where was the first cut? Answer: I don't know. I was confused at this time and didn't know anything. Judge: Did your husband shout when you killed him? Answer: Sir, I don't know if he shouted or not. I was confused. Judge: Why did you kill your husband? Answer: It wasn't premeditated. It was a matter of the moment. He was usually bad-tempered. He ate, whored, gambled, and often ran the escort agency. If I asked him for living expenses, he would beat me. We were married for nine years without any affection.

(In Court) Judge: Then you could have divorced? Answer: I don't understand the law. My husband helped others say that he wouldn't give me living expenses and would let me have affairs, so he wouldn't have to pay me alimony when we divorced. Judge: Why did you chop him into sixteen pieces? Answer: After I killed him, it seemed like someone was telling me in my ear to chop him up, chop him up. Judge: Have you read "Ling Kong Shu"? Answer: No. Judge: Who else is in your family? Answer: No one. Judge: No one on your mother's side? Answer: No one on my mother's side, and no relatives on Zhan's side either. The judge then asked: Do you have a relationship with Little Ningbo? Answer: No, not at all. Judge: Why did you admit it before? Answer: I was forced to confess by torture at the police station. I had no choice and couldn't make my own decisions. Judge: You previously confessed that Little Ningbo gave you money to buy the kitchen knife? Answer: No. Judge: Did Little Ningbo tell you to kill him? Answer: He never said that. Judge: How could you, alone, kill Zhan Yunying, such a tall man? Answer: My soul wasn't in my body. I was possessed. When I killed him, I didn't treat him like a person, but like killing something else. Judge: Was the light on when you killed him? Answer: No. Judge: Did you have an affair with He Damazi, who lived in the front building? Answer: No affair, just some money. The judge immediately asked: Why are you now reversing all your previous confessions? Answer: I've always said this. Judge: Did He Damazi help you when you killed him? Answer: No. Judge: Then why did he run away afterwards? Answer: Someone from the countryside asked him to bring pancakes back, so he went back to the countryside.

(The Questioning) ended here. The presiding judge asked Zhou: Answer: Please, sir, I didn't do it intentionally. I was really confused for a moment, possessed. Please, sir, grant me a chance to live. Then the debate began, first with the prosecutor's argument, followed by the defense lawyer's response. (The reasons are detailed in the appeal). The presiding judge announced the end of the debate and waited for the court to deliberate before announcing the verdict on the spot. It was 3:05 PM. The defendant was temporarily taken away. The spectators discussed the matter animatedly, and the atmosphere was very tense. At 3:12 PM, the judges returned to the court and brought up the defendant. The presiding judge stood up and read the main text of the judgment: Zhan Zhou is sentenced to death for murder, deprived of public rights for life, and the kitchen knife is confiscated. The defendant wanted to argue more after hearing the verdict, repeatedly saying "not intentional." The court waved to stop her and told her that if she did not accept the verdict, she could apply for review to the Supreme Court in Nanjing within ten days after receiving the verdict. The defendant was then taken away by the bailiffs and detained.

It is noted that American lawyer Courtenay and several Japanese lawyers were retained on behalf of the defendant at this trial.

### Shen Ke Sues United Press for Libel · Foreign Journalists Oppose Our Acceptance · Telegrams Sent to U.S. Secretary of State and Wu Dingchang · Requesting Revocation Through Appropriate Legal Procedures

[City News] The Foreign Correspondents' Club of China yesterday telegraphed U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes and Wu Dingchang, Director of the Bureau of Civil Affairs of the Chinese National Government, to strongly protest the Chinese court's acceptance of the case of Shen Ke, a national of a former enemy state currently being tried for war crimes, against Maitland, manager of the United Press China bureau, for defamation. The telegram to Byrnes was signed by twenty-five British and American correspondents, requesting the U.S. government to advise the Chinese government to oppose the acceptance of this case. The telegram to Director Wu Dingchang urged him to [fully consider the significant implications of the case], because foreign journalists believe that this case seriously damages freedom of the press and threatens their safety and personal freedom, and requested [revocation based on appropriate Chinese legal procedures]. Both telegrams pointed out that Shen Ke accused Maitland of defaming him in his news reports by stating that he was a Nazi spy, but in fact, these reports were based on official announcements from the U.S. military authorities. The foreign correspondents pointed out that Shen Ke has been deemed a [despicable] Nazi, and the Chinese government has decided to deport him. Legal authorities say that in this situation, he should have been deprived of his public rights long ago.

### Four Traitors Convicted · Heaviest Sentence Four Years · Sun Zuji's Case Concluded · Verdict Announced on the 23rd

[Report from Our Newspaper] The High Court yesterday sentenced the four suspected traitors: Zhang Yifeng was sentenced to four years imprisonment, Chou Shuxian to three years, Xu Shengyang to two years and six months, and Qi Huichang to one year and six months. All property will be confiscated, except for what is deemed necessary for the living expenses of their families.

On the same day, the cases of Sun Zuji, the former mayor of the puppet Hangzhou government, and Liu Zhenqun, the former specialist of the secretariat of the puppet Central Political Committee, were concluded. The verdicts will be announced on the 23rd.

### Xue Gengxin · Deeply Sinful

Xue Gengxin, the former inspector-general of the Municipal French Concession Police, colluded with the enemy and puppets during the occupation and arrested our underground comrades. After the victory, he fled to North China and was captured by the authorities and escorted to Shanghai. The High Procuratorate investigated and prosecuted him. Xue is currently 36 years old and a native of Shanghai. The indictment states that the defendant was formerly a translator in the Malong Squad of the French Concession Police and was promoted to inspector-general after the war of resistance. He colluded with Sheng You to transport opium and used the [Malong Squad] to help the enemy arrest our underground comrades. On August 1, 32nd year [of the Republic], the puppet government took back the Shanghai concessions, and the defendant served as inspector-general and chief of the economic section of the puppet Third Police Bureau, then rose to become chief of the Meilan District Branch Bureau, deputy chief of the Huangpu Branch Bureau, and deputy director of the Special High Department of the puppet Police General Bureau. He also used the name of the Japanese Goto, director of the Special High Department, to forcibly purchase materials from various manufacturers at low prices and sell them on the black market for profit. According to reports from Qi Zaiyu and others, secret workers of the Military Intelligence Bureau in Shanghai, in the 29th year [of the Republic], the Shanghai West Special Operations organization lacked henchmen in the French Concession, so they won over the defendant and paid him a stipend. He also fought with Police Inspector Li to establish the Criminal Eighth Station to assist the enemy and puppets in arresting our underground comrades. The case was adjourned for further hearing.

Zhao Riliang, a translator for the Special High Department of the puppet police bureau, was originally sentenced to eight years. The defendant appealed, and the case was remanded for retrial. The court opened the retrial yesterday afternoon for further investigation. The case of Chen Jiu, the former chief secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Baojia Preparatory Committee, was investigated yesterday, and Cheng Zhiliang and others were called as witnesses for questioning. The case of Zhang Yunfang, chairman of the Shanghai Hardware Industry Association, was continued for further hearing because the defendant himself did not appear.

### Trucks Soliciting Passengers · Rickshaws Severely Affected · Police Bureau Orders All Branches to Crack Down

[Report from Our Newspaper] Due to the lack of public transportation in the city and the high prices of rickshaws, large trucks carrying passengers have emerged, stopping at fixed locations and soliciting business, especially in the Hongkou and Zhabei areas. The fares are very cheap, with the highest fare being only 500 yuan. After the trend of trucks carrying passengers became popular, it not only hindered traffic but also violated the Public Works Bureau's automobile management regulations. The rickshaw business has also been severely affected. Now, in order to maintain their livelihood, they have submitted a petition to the Police Bureau yesterday, requesting a crackdown. It is said that the Police Bureau has ordered all branches to implement it starting today.

### Bathhouse Labor Dispute Rages · Dozens of Businesses Vandalized

[Report from Our Newspaper] Although the bathhouse labor-management dispute was mediated by the authorities, the veteran workers did not accept it. After the vandalism that occurred at the Xinquan Pool on Fuxing Middle Road the night before last, dozens of bathhouses, both large and small, were vandalized yesterday afternoon throughout the city. In the central district, such as Grand View Garden, Anle Pool, and Paradise, there were also incidents in the Nanshi and Zhabei areas. The veteran workers rushed into the bathhouses in batches, posted slogans, and forced the new employees to stop working. Those who resisted were beaten, and glass windows, tables, and chairs were destroyed, resulting in heavy losses. It is said that in several locations, the district police arrested several perpetrators and took them to the bureau for interrogation.

### · Visiting Engineering Facilities in the Second District · Two Major Scenic Spots Restored to Their Former Glory · Longhua Pagoda and City God Temple Have a New Look · Two Hundred Stalls Will Rent Space at Small World to Operate

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] At 2:00 PM yesterday, the reporter followed Wu Wenhua, director of the Second District Engineering Management Office of the Municipal Public Works Bureau, Specialist Qian Weifan, Engineer Xu Dexian, and others to visit the engineering facilities in the Second District. In order to achieve division of labor, cooperation, and greater efficiency, the Public Works Bureau divided the engineering facilities into six districts. The so-called Second District includes most of the area east of the former French Concession's Zhengzhong South Road, the entire old walled city of Nanshi, along Xujiahui Road to Caohejing, Minhang, and other places, and also manages the entire Pudong area. We boarded a large truck from the Public Works Bureau and departed from the YMCA in Baxianqiao, to Longhua, then to Nanshi, visited the City God Temple, and then returned to our original route.

Remembering Jinji Road: Greatest Contribution

The characteristic of the Second District of the Public Works Bureau is that it possesses two historical scenic spots – Longhua Pagoda and the City God Temple. Both of these major sites were broken and incomplete during the eight years of war, with a desolate appearance! In the past year, with the full cooperation of the citizens and the authorities, most of them have been restored. The clay Bodhisattvas in the temples are painted brightly, and from the top of the Longhua Pagoda, you can overlook the iron birds rising and falling in the airport. These were all automatically raised funds by the local leaders to repair them. It is believed that more pious men and women will come to the temple next spring to burn incense. The greatest contribution of the Second District of the Public Works Bureau here is the widening of Jinji Road – the only avenue from the city center to Longhua – by one meter on each side. In the future, the crowded conditions on this road during the incense season will definitely be greatly improved.

Lotus Pond – Removing Silt

After visiting Longhua Pagoda, we turned to the City God Temple. The City God Temple is a commercial and recreational center, constantly handling a large number of tourists throughout the years. The destruction it suffered during the long war was even more severe, with many buildings collapsing and burning. The reconstruction of the City God Temple after the recovery was initiated by local people. After the Public Works Bureau agreed, a reorganization committee was organized, and all expenses were jointly funded by the citizens and the government. Now, it is all completed. The largest project was the removal of silt from the Lotus Pond of the City God Temple. People who have visited the City God Temple know that the Lotus Pond under the Nine-Bend Bridge has always been used by old Buddhist ladies as a release pond. It was originally a stagnant pool, and it is unknown how many years had passed. Tourists continuously threw garbage into the river, so it had long been foul-smelling.

Catching Turtles – Open Secret

The Public Works Bureau believed that this pool of sewage not only detracted from the view but also directly affected the health of countless people. Therefore, in May of this year, it thoroughly replaced this pool of ten thousand gallons of sewage! The fire brigade was responsible for the pumping project. It is said that when the water was drained, in addition to a small number of fish, there were countless turtles of all sizes left on the silt. The people who sold turtles inevitably took the opportunity to catch them. In fact, the people who caught the turtles must also be the people who sold the turtles. It is unknown what those who specialize in releasing animals to cultivate virtue think of this open secret?

Small World – Splendid

In addition, the Small World near the City God Temple was instantly turned into a rubble field by a wildfire during the war. Now, under the auspices of Huang Jinrong, Zong Cailiang, and others, a new Small World has been built, which is taller and more solid than the old one, and includes cinemas, cafes, open-air dance halls, storytelling houses, and other entertainment venues. According to Mr. Zong: The vacant second floor has been decided to be rented to vendors from the Zhubaoshan Road area, accommodating a total of two hundred stalls, all equipped with glass counters. The contract has now been signed, and the lessee, Datong Company, will receive a net income of 3 million yuan per month, which will be shared equally by the two hundred vendors. After the installation is completed, it will be open for business soon. Once the vendors are revived there, Small World will become the commercial and entertainment center of Nanshi, which is beyond doubt.

After this visit, the reporter deeply felt that Longhua Temple and the City God Temple, the two major scenic spots in the city, have indeed been restored. However, it is not enough to rely solely on the restoration of these two places. Moreover, what China needs after the revival is not just restoration, but creation!

### Appendectomy Without Anesthesia · Forced to Stand at Attention for Ten Consecutive Days · Allied Prisoners of War Suffered Torture · Japanese War Criminal Kawashima Sentenced to Hanging · Matsuda Sentenced to Seven Years of Labor ·

[Report from Our Newspaper] Kawashima, a medical officer at the Shenyang Forward Military Prisoner-of-War Camp, was sentenced to hanging by the U.S. Military Tribunal in this city for his confirmed atrocities against Allied prisoners of war. Matsuda, the director of the camp, was sentenced to seven years of labor for beating American prisoners of war and for failing to prevent the deaths of three American prisoners of war who were sentenced to death for attempting to escape during his tenure. Many Allied soldiers, heroes of the Battle of Bataan, were unfortunately captured due to the disparity in numbers and were detained in this concentration camp. When Prosecutor Major Fowler read out the depositions, he mentioned the testimony of General Wainwright, a hero of Bataan, who denied the rumors of any communication with Matsuda. Another witness was American medic Humberstone, who stated that according to Matsuda's orders, Japanese soldiers gave prisoners of war with severe pneumonia only three centimeters of thiamine powder per day, and even this small amount was withheld when the prisoners' temperature dropped slightly. American Sergeant Cole was suffering from appendicitis when he was arrested, and Kawashima deliberately delayed his treatment. Only when his appendix ruptured did he allow him to enter the hospital for surgery. In 1944, Kawashima refused to isolate patients with mumps from their companions, resulting in the infection of one-third of the prisoners of war. Sergeant Cole's testimony was particularly tragic. He wrote that he was sent to the hospital for surgery three days after suffering from appendicitis. At that time, the anesthetic had been used up, so he had to undergo the English surgery while fully conscious. Occasionally, when he groaned or cried out in pain, Kawashima would hit him on the head and shout, "No noise!" After the surgery was completed, Kawashima ordered him to get up from the operating table and walk to the bed himself. Kawashima had two nicknames in the concentration camp, one was "Butcher" and the other was "No Noise".

Sergeant Reynerson testified that one day, when the prisoners of war returned to the camp after labor, Kawashima ordered the sick to step forward. About eight or nine people responded, most of whom suffered from frostbite, with their toes frozen to a purplish-black color. Kawashima ordered them to take off their shoes and socks and stand on the ice. At that time, the weather was already twenty-one degrees below zero. Kawashima severely reprimanded them, saying that there was no such thing as "frostbite" in the world, and then allowed them to leave.

Another American sergeant, Lai, testified that he had witnessed Matsuda's assistant, Miki, beat four prisoners of war with a wooden stick three feet long and half an inch thick. He said that Miki severely beat these four people on the head below the ears, and they often fell to the ground after being hit. He continued to beat them until they could not move, and said that this was one way to educate the American army. He said that the American army was like beasts and should be treated like beasts. Miki claimed to be 30 years old and a graduate of the Economics Department of Tokyo Imperial University. He admitted to insulting about ten to fifteen American soldiers. He has now been sentenced to twenty years of hard labor.

Miki mentioned the execution of the three American prisoners who attempted to escape: The execution was carried out on July 13, 1943. They were first blindfolded, then their arms were stretched out on a wooden cross, and they were ordered to sit down with their legs crossed. From seven or eight meters away, the Japanese gunmen knelt down and aimed at them, one shooting the head and one shooting the chest, firing one shot at a time for fun.

Another American lieutenant proved that he had witnessed a Japanese officer grinding the face of an American sailor with the heel of his leather shoe. Another American prisoner of war was ordered to stand at attention for ten consecutive days, during which he was only allowed to sleep for ten hours.

It is noted that American lawyer Courtenay and several Japanese lawyers were retained on behalf of the defendant at this trial.

### Siming Hospital Shanghai Planning Second Phase of Improvements

[Report from Our Newspaper] Siming Hospital Shanghai hosted the press yesterday to discuss the hospital's charitable work.

After four years of hard work, it has taken shape, but due to financial constraints, it has not been able to expand on a large scale according to the planned plan. The hospital is now making a second phase of improvement plans and hopes that all academic circles will support it.

### Ministry of Education Issues Nationwide Order Promoting National Education and Limiting Fees

[Our Nanjing News] In order to popularize national education, after the Ministry of Education promulgated the Second Five-Year Implementation Plan this year, it is urgently necessary to conduct a thorough investigation of whether various provinces and cities have increased the number of central national schools and Bao national schools in accordance with the plan and to seek promotion. The Ministry of Education is promoting the popularization of national education on the one hand, and taking care of poor students on the other hand. Moreover, national education is compulsory education and should not be charged. Therefore, a special order is issued nationwide to limit fees, so that families in difficult circumstances can easily enroll. All of these must be observed from the field and promoted and improved. Tang Deyuan, a member of the National Education Guidance Committee, has been sent to inspect the current status of the implementation of national education in the recovery of education in the provinces and cities of North China. Tang has already set off on an inspection tour. The extent to which national education has progressed in the cities of Beijing and Shanghai and other provinces and cities will also be followed up with the dispatch of personnel for inspection. Furthermore, since the provinces and cities have greatly increased the number of Bao national schools in accordance with the Five-Year Implementation Plan for National Education, a large number of teachers are needed. The Ministry of Education has taken this into account in the Educational Administrative Plan for the thirty-sixth year, and has given flexibility to provinces and cities that cultivate teachers for the promotion of national education. For example, in cases where teachers are urgently needed, short-term teacher training can be carried out according to the actual situation, and even a one-year simple teacher training program is not impossible. For the current emergency, the method of using substitute teachers can be adopted, and the standards can be raised and training increased at an appropriate time. Because national education originally had a stage of four years of primary school and two years of senior primary school, simple teachers can teach those with four years of education in Bao schools, it is said.

### National Taiwan University to Open on October 1st

### Students from Six Major Universities Request Distribution from the Ministry of Education; Minister Zhu Refuses

[Our Nanjing News, 16th] More than 30 representatives of returning students from six universities, including Chongqing University, went to the Ministry of Education at 10:30 a.m. on the 16th to petition. They were first received by Chief Secretary Huo Huan, but the talks yielded no results. Around 12:00 p.m., Minister Zhu came out to meet them and said that the distribution they requested had not been explicitly approved by the ministry and was not in accordance with the regulations, so it was difficult to do. He also rebuked the students for not making noise in the office and then left in a hurry. The students, unable to obtain results, waited on empty stomachs, firmly requesting an opportunity to speak. At about 4:00 p.m., Vice Minister Hang came out and explained four points to the students: (1) The students' petition in Chongqing was to ask for assistance in returning home, which the Ministry of Education has done. (2) Students from National Lin University and National Middle School have no schools to attend, while the students' situation is different. (3) Director He Shijun went to Shanghai to negotiate with the top ten universities for transfer exams and has achieved satisfactory results, and everyone can be accommodated as much as possible, so the students should not be afraid of taking the exams. (4) Director Zhou Hongjing will discuss the transfer exam methods for the Nanjing area with the presidents of various universities on the 22nd. The distribution is really difficult to do. After Hang finished speaking, he also left. The students continued to have earnest talks with Zhai Hezhou and others, but there were still no results. They did not leave the ministry until 5:00 p.m. According to them, the purpose of today's petition was to hear opinions, because they had no opportunity to speak until the end.

### Hao Gengsheng's Report on Inspection of the Northeast: Students' Meals Lack Oil, Only Boiled Salted Soybeans as Accompaniment; Teachers Have Not Received Salaries, Voluntarily Teaching for Four Months

[Our Nanjing News] Hao Gengsheng, an inspector appointed by the Ministry of Education, submitted a report to the Ministry of Education on the inspection of education in the Northeast. A brief account was published in this newspaper yesterday. His inspection reports on Northeast China University, Changchun University, and Jilin University have also been submitted to the Ministry. A more detailed account is now published below:

Sale of Enemy and Puppet Property Reaches 500 Million

(1) Preparatory Office of the Private Northeast China University: The school will set up five colleges of Liberal Arts, Law, Science, Engineering, and Agriculture. The Colleges of Liberal Arts and Law will use the former Xingya Hall, which has spacious buildings. The Colleges of Science and Engineering will use the old site of the former Fengtian Industrial University in Tiexi (the Japanese spent 1.5 million yen to build the school), with buildings covering an area of more than 13,000 square meters. Among them, the main equipment has been transported away, and there is still a part of the remaining equipment that can be used. The College of Agriculture is located on Siping Street, which was originally a Japanese farm with a large scale. Regarding the funds, the proceeds from the sale of enemy and puppet property reached 500 million [currency unit unclear] in currency. The school's application for record filing is being actively processed. An official document has already been submitted to the ministry. At the same time, Du Yuming, the chairman of the school's board of directors, has sent a special letter to the minister explaining everything.

Palace-Style Construction with Heating Equipment

(2) Changchun University, which is about to be established: The school plans to set up five colleges of Liberal Arts, Law, Science, Engineering, and Agriculture. The College of Agriculture was originally the site of the Jian Country University of the puppet Manchukuo. The Jian Country University was directly under the puppet Manchukuo State Council, and the students were mostly civil servants undergoing training. The buildings are mostly palace-style, and the auditorium can accommodate at least 3,000 people. The floor is damaged, the seats are empty, and the heating equipment is still intact. Not far from the school is a Jian Country Martyrs' Shrine, which is entirely palace-style and beautifully constructed. Although some of the buildings have bullet marks, the building itself is generally undamaged. The scale of this temple is grand and can be used by Changchun University, but it is still under consideration and has not yet been determined. The Colleges of Liberal Arts and Law are located in the former puppet Ministry of Education. The equipment is incomplete, and the buildings are not greatly damaged. They can be used after repairing the doors and windows. The College of Engineering will use the former Xinjing Industrial University, which has not been much damaged and is currently occupied by the military. The College of Medicine was originally the Xinjing Medical University, with all of its equipment intact. The spirit of the students and nurses is excellent. In the past, almost all of the professors were Japanese. Currently, Guo Songgen from Taiwan is working hard to maintain the school. He has been temporarily appointed as acting president by Special Envoy Zang to maintain the school's affairs. Adjustments will be made after the preparatory personnel of Changchun University arrive. There are currently 186 students. The class situation at the college is very good. To prevent cholera, students have given lectures and administered injections on the streets, and their service spirit is excellent. Among the students in Changchun who plan to enter Changchun University, 800 to 900 are from Shenyang, and nearly 1,000 are from Harbin and other places. The students and school buildings of the school do not seem to be a problem. The key is to have someone in charge to prepare for the opening of school as soon as possible. Gengsheng urged Director Huang in Beiping to go there on a fixed date, and it is said that he set off for Changchun on August 10th.

Sturdy Glass Windows Burned into Wavy Shapes

(3) Chinese Academy of Sciences: During the puppet Manchukuo period, the academy was the center for the Japanese to develop the rich resources of the Northeast and promote the expansion of its industrial national defense technology research. Although the scale of the scientific research institution is not very large, it includes many departments. After August 15th, some of the equipment was looted unsuccessfully and destroyed by burning. Although the library had fire prevention equipment, gasoline flames turned the books on the bookshelves to ashes, and the sturdy glass windows were burned into wavy shapes, which shows the intensity of the burning. The academy is now taken over by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. According to the academic research system, it seems that the Central Research Institute should continue to run it.

Local People Disappointed that Jilin University Will Not Be Restored

(4) Jilin University Tutorial Classes are located at the old site of the former Jilin University. Jilin University was completed before September 18th. Its predecessor was the Higher Normal School in the 25th year of the Republic of China. In the 27th year, the Japanese changed it to the Shidao Higher School, and in the 31st year, it was changed to the Shidao University. At that time, there were more than 1,700 students. After August 15th, troops were stationed there, and students and faculty members spontaneously organized to protect the school, so the damage to the school property was limited, and the loss was minimal (troops had been stationed there seven times in the past). There are currently 25 faculty members (14 staff members) and 353 students, including 59 female students. There are 25 faculty residences, which can accommodate 40 families. There are more than 30,000 books. The chemical instruments were damaged, but fortunately the total loss is less than 25%. Currently, remedial classes are being offered. The funds are raised by the faculty and students of the school from all parties. After Gengsheng and Special Envoy Zang inspected the school, the Special Envoy's Office agreed to allocate a subsidy of 450,000 [currency unit unclear] per month. The students of the school live a hard life, and their meals lack oil, so they only cook salted soybeans as a side dish. Since August 15th, the teachers have not received their salaries and have been voluntarily teaching for nearly four months. The school buildings are suitable for use as a normal school. Local people in Jilin are very enthusiastic about restoring the original Jilin University. Chairman Liang once gathered local people and explained to Gengsheng the reasons for restoring Jilin University as follows: (1) The provincial government has long paid attention to this matter and resolved at the provincial government committee meeting to restore Jilin University as soon as possible. (2) Restoring Jilin University is restoring an old school, not establishing a new one. (3) Changchun University is located too far west, not as suitable as Yongji. (4) Yongji has beautiful mountains and rivers and a higher cultural level, so it is hoped that there will be a university. (5) If limited to the regulations of the government school name, using the place name instead of the province name, then Yongji is the location of Jilin City and can still be called Jilin University. (6) Zhang Zuoxiang once used his own strength to run a university, but today the central government is not restoring it, which really disappoints the local people. When Gengsheng left Shenyang and Beiping, Chairman Han of Heilongjiang Province, Chairman Wu of Hejiang Province, and the heads of the education and finance departments of the two provinces also repeatedly requested to forward the request to restore Jilin University in a timely manner.

30,000 Artifacts Looted One After Another

(5) Museum: Originally Tang Yulin's residence, it was converted into a museum by the Japanese after September 18th. Currently, the Special Envoy's Office of the headquarters is also located here. However, most of the upper floor is occupied by the military's Special Envoy's Office and has not yet been read out. There are five ancient relic storage rooms inside. There were originally 37,803 ancient relics, which were looted one after another. For example, the Buddha statues in the Rehe Imperial Palace that could not be taken away were destroyed. What remains are only inscriptions and stone carvings. The Northeast Cultural Relics Preservation Committee is now preparing to be established to sort out the lost relics. It is planned to appoint Mr. Jin Yuzhan as the director to be responsible for the work.

Former Stable Wen Su Ge Has Many Ming Dynasty Archives

(6) (Thirteen) Library: The library is located in the old palace, formerly known as Wen Su Ge. It stores the Complete Library of the Four Branches of Literature, including 9,071 volumes of the Zibu, 12,265 volumes of the Jibu, 9,408 volumes of the History Department, 5,509 volumes of the Classics Department, and 5,020 volumes of the Palace Edition of the Illustrated Compendium of Books. In addition, there are 127 volumes of the Palace Edition of the General Catalogue of the Complete Library of the Four Branches of Literature and 72 volumes of the Textual Research of the Complete Library of the Four Branches of Literature. In addition to the 41,273 volumes of the Complete Library of the Four Branches of Literature, there are 150,000 other books. The library contains many archives from the Ming Dynasty, and there is also an extremely valuable book by the Japanese Shimayo, which is also stored in the library. Shimayo originally wanted to sell it, and we are willing to keep it for use. This issue has not yet been resolved. The Wen Su Ge library has solid construction and is fireproof. The bookshelves are all made of steel, and the doors and windows are covered with iron sheets to ensure safety.

Feng Yong University Temporarily Not Planning to Restore

(7) In addition, according to President Feng himself, Shenyang Private Feng Yong University is not planning to restore this year because the school's property cannot be recovered and the source of funds has been cut off. Due to factual difficulties, I was unable to visit the above-mentioned schools in Harbin, but the general situation can be known from the process of Mayor Yang's filing of the Harbin Maintaining Education Ministry's Directly-Managed University. All adjustments to the schools above the junior college level in the Northeast region, except for the schools in the unrecovered areas, are generally in line with the methods indicated by the Ministry.

They felt that the training period was too short and that they should maintain contact with each other in their future work to jointly seek improvements. To foster camaraderie among the graduating trainees, they suggested to Section Chief Chen that a alumni association be organized and a directory published. Section Chief Chen immediately agreed to plan this after the training of all public administration personnel in the city is completed. It is reported that the second and third training sessions will begin simultaneously on the 18th.

Instructions for Completing the Household Re-Verification Form

The Second Section of the Shanghai Municipal Government's Department of Civil Affairs has recently compiled "Instructions for Completing the Household Re-Verification Form Before Registration Transcription," as follows:

Re-verifying household registrations before transcribing them into the registry is of utmost importance. Because this is the first time setting up a household registry, the obligor is not required to fill out another household registration application. The household survey form will serve as the application. Since the household survey was conducted in this city in February, there have been many discrepancies between the household information recorded on the household survey form and the actual household situation. Therefore, the original household survey form cannot be rashly used as the basis for transcription. A household re-verification must be carried out before transcription.

Secondly, existing household survey forms contain many errors because (1) the personnel handling the initial household survey were unfamiliar with the form-filling methods, and (2) the laws and regulations have changed repeatedly, leaving the form-fillers at a loss. If transcription is based on these errors, the errors will be compounded. Correcting errors after household registration is cumbersome, so a detailed re-verification must be carried out before transcription to avoid registration errors.

Now that the transcription work is about to begin, we must clearly recognize the following points before re-verifying household registrations: (1) There must be absolutely no errors in any of the household registration fields. Therefore, the household survey form must be accurately recorded before transcription. (2) After household registration begins, household administration in this city will be brought onto the right track, and there should no longer be any inaccurate household registration information. (3) To ensure the accuracy of household registration, it must start with the household. Every household and every individual must be accurately recorded. One Jia, one Bao, and even the entire city will be accurate. Therefore, every citizen and every re-verification staff member must recognize this point, cherish household administration in this city, and not be careless or sloppy with household re-verification.

To ensure accurate re-verification, the form-filling methods for each field of the household survey form are explained in detail below for reference by the citizens of this city and all levels of public administration personnel. Furthermore, these instructions are a unified regulation for past form-filling methods. In the future, all application forms and registration books shall be filled out in accordance with these instructions.

1.  Relationship to Head of Household The "Relationship to Head of Household" explains the identity relationship of each member within the household. The identity relationship of each member within a common household is centered on the head of household. Therefore, how each member is related is based on the head of household as the referent. When surveying a household, it is easy to make mistakes if someone other than the head of household answers the surveyor. For example, if the head of household is the "father," and the "second son" answers during the survey, the "eldest daughter-in-law" may mistakenly answer as "sister-in-law." Therefore, when citizens answer surveyors or fill out application forms themselves, they should use the tone of the head of household so that the relationship of each person is not mistaken. Survey personnel should pay more attention to this type of error during surveys. The identity relationship of each member within a common business household can be filled out according to each person's position within the business organization, such as "accountant" or "shopkeeper" in a store, or "teacher" or "student" in a school.

2.  Name "Name" is a person's identifying mark in society. A person's rights and obligations are based on their name. Therefore, the name entered should be the name commonly used in society. Pseudonyms, assumed names, or a woman's customary use of "So-and-so Shi" should not be used. The "Regulations on Restrictions on the Use of Names" promulgated by the National Government on July 17, 1941, contain the following provisions regarding names, which demonstrate that filling out the name when registering a household must be done with caution.

(Article 1) A citizen of the Republic of China shall have only one given name. The name registered in the household registry is the given name. A person using a courtesy name or pseudonym shall indicate their given name. (Article 2) The acquisition, establishment, transfer, or alteration of property rights shall be done using the given name or by indicating the given name. (Article 3) If shared property is used under a trade name or other name, the given names of the co-owners shall be indicated. If the total number of co-owners exceeds twenty, only the given names of the representatives may be indicated. (Article 6) In response to a lawful investigation by a public official, the given name shall be reported. Failure to use the given name shall be punishable by detention or a fine of one hundred yuan or less.

3.  Gender Indicate male or female. (To be continued)

### Stock Exchange's First Day of Trading Sees Over 4 Million Shares Traded - Bull Market Shows High Prices but Lackluster Momentum - Collective Accounting at 5 PM Yields Good Results

[Our Report] The Stock Exchange officially opened trading on various listed stocks at 10:00 AM yesterday. After a bull market opening, trading was generally stable. The atmosphere was also quite relaxed. After two hours of trading, prices of all stocks trended downwards.

At 9:50 AM, Chairman of the Board Du Yong, General Manager Wang Zhixin, Assistant Managers Yang Yinbo and Gu Shanchang, Chief Secretary Hua Wenyu, Manager Chen Xubi, and Deputy Manager Zhang Jisan entered the trading floor in succession. At exactly 10:00 AM, Du himself rang the opening bell. As the bell rang, each trading counter began its bull market. Five minutes later, the bull markets for each stock opened. The bell rang again, and official trading began. The shouts of brokers buying and selling immediately followed.

Yesterday's market in general was relatively stable. Due to psychological factors, blue-chip stocks ("two big, three small") and a few unpopular mid-sized stocks saw high prices in the bull market opening. After opening prices were established, bullish investors took profits, gradually being pressured by sellers. However, financial backers intermittently provided some support, so although the process was lackluster, there were many fluctuations. Throughout the market, only the unpopular small stocks Huafeng Enamel and Liann Department Store stood out. The former was boosted by scattered speculative funds, and the latter deliberately pushed up its price near noon, ending at a high price. However, trading in these two stocks was not widespread. As a result, compared to the previous closing, Yong'an Textile and Meiya (probably a stock abbreviation) fell slightly, while Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing each fell half a percent. Among unpopular stocks, besides Huafeng and Lian'an being the most prominent, the former rose slightly, while the latter opened low but rose by over 20%, ending at the highest price, resulting in a sharp increase of 40% compared to last Saturday. The rest fell slightly. Mid-sized stocks saw a rebound of half a percent.

Yesterday's price limits for each stock were calculated separately based on the bull market opening prices of each stock. In the future, the price limits for each stock will be calculated separately based on the previous day's closing price.

Yesterday, the total number of shares traded was 4,347,400. The stock with the highest trading volume was Yong'an Textile Factory, reaching 1.2 million shares. Jingfu also had nearly 500,000 shares. The trading volume of Xinguang, Qinxing, and Yong'an Company stocks also exceeded 300,000 shares each. China Textile and China Silk Industry had lower volumes, both under 10,000 shares.

At 5:00 PM, all brokers gathered at the market to collectively close their accounts. By 6:39 PM, all accounts were balanced. The Stock Exchange authorities were satisfied. The Stock Exchange also posted several announcements in the stock market yesterday. The important ones are summarized below:

Announcement No. 14: When delivering shares, each broker must attach the following documents to each share certificate: 1. A securities delivery voucher must be attached to the front of the share certificate. 2. The following must be attached to the back of the share certificate:

(1) Share transfer application form. (2) Share trading record form. (3) Share sale contract (red or blue is acceptable). All of the above must be stamped with the broker's official seal.

Announcement No. 15: Regarding securities settlement matters, please pay attention to the following points, listed separately: 1. For the convenience of settlement, each broker should submit bank drafts that can be exchanged, and must stamp the back of the draft with the broker's name and number seal. 2. To ensure smooth settlement for each broker, it is more convenient for even-numbered firms to open accounts with the Bank of China, and odd-numbered firms to open accounts with the Trust Department of the Bank of Communications. 3. Due to exchange time constraints, collections are from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM. 4. Securities received are limited to 11:30 AM to 2:00 PM. 5. Securities issued are limited to 9:30 AM to 11:30 AM the next morning. 6. Payment for goods issued is limited to 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM.

### Gold and Banknotes Show Slight Decline - Used Pianos Unaffected

Yesterday, smelting red gold was very ordinary. It opened in the morning at 2.155 million, which was quickly surrounded by sellers. The Central Bank had some control, gradually declining to below 2.14 million. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated four or five bars at a price of 2.14 million. Afterwards, it was more peaceful, hovering between 2.13 million and 2.14 million. At noon, it struggled at 2.14 million. The afternoon was slightly more stable, with no major changes. The result was a decline of 23,000 compared to last Saturday. Gold jewelry was at 22,700. Silver bullion was flat. Silver coins rose slightly. Black market interest rates have retreated to within 1.5 jiao.

Foreign currencies were quiet and slightly weak. The US dollar started selling at 3,400 yuan in the morning, gradually trending downward. It once fell as low as 3,350 yuan near noon. At noon, it hovered around 3,360 yuan. The afternoon was slightly better, but lacked special changes. The result was a drop of 20 yuan compared to last Saturday. Hong Kong dollars were unstable. Hong Kong telegraphic transfers were as high as 144.5 yuan, with the exchange rate just over 692 yuan, showing a slight weakness, with a result of 5 yuan lower than last Saturday. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 690 yuan to 700 yuan. The Indian exchange rate was 835 yuan to 840 yuan. The British exchange rate was selling at 11,150 yuan. The number of transactions increased slightly. The US exchange rate still stood at the listed price.

### Off-Exchange Trading - Government Bonds Gradually Decline - Foreign Stocks Lack Confidence

Government bonds yesterday still saw many short sales, slightly declining. Series C bonds opened in the morning at 2,350 yuan, which was quickly competed for by sellers, gradually trending downward. In the middle, it once broke the 2,000 yuan mark, seeing a low price of 1,990 yuan. There was some short covering at the low price, and the volume of transactions was relatively active. After several firms actively traded, it closed above 2,100 yuan, resulting in a decline of 200 yuan compared to last Saturday. Series A and B fell slightly by 250 yuan. Series D fell by 100 yuan. Series E also fell by 150 yuan. The volume of transactions reached over 6 million yuan in face value.

Foreign stocks saw some short positions cut due to the lack of news about the opening of trading. The overall trend was unfavorable. Except for steel, which rose slightly, the rest fell from the opening price. As a result, compared to the previous closing, steel rose slightly, Yibier (probably stock abbreviation) fell slightly, Asian fell by 10%, and the rest fell by about half a percent.

### Tea Market Transactions Decrease Slightly

For red and green tea varieties, Tianjin brokers' efforts to move goods remain stagnant. Foreign firms' transactions were also not as active as last week. Because ships sailing overseas on the 23rd have been loaded with a considerable amount of goods from each exporting firm, and are awaiting shipment, buying sentiment has been reduced. The sale of Taiwan fine red tea and native firm textile products has been discussed between buyers and sellers several times, but a satisfactory solution has not yet been reached.

### 8,000 Tons of Indian Cotton Arrive

[Our Report] The Niels Maersk, managed by the Great Britain Company, arrived from Bombay yesterday, carrying 8,000 tons of cotton, about 29,000-plus bales, as well as residual drums of glycerol. It is currently docked at buoys 17 and 18, unloading groceries. It will unload the cotton when it berths alongside the pier. In addition, two President Lines vessels of the United States Lines arrived in Shanghai yesterday: the Weirton and the Marine Carp, both carrying over 9,000 tons of goods from the United States.

### Mexican Gold Price - Equivalent to 1.25 Million

The recent market price of Mexican gold is US$1,200 per kilogram. One kilogram equals 2.204 pounds, which is equal to 2 Chinese market catties. Calculated at the current exchange rate of 3,350 yuan, the cost per ten taels is only worth 1,256,250 yuan in legal tender. If the exchange rate had not increased, each ten taels would still be less than one million yuan.

### Central Bank Convenes National Business Conference

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] The Central Bank, in order to review its business, has scheduled a national business conference to be held in Nanjing in October. Managers from all branches will come to Nanjing. If they can arrive at the beginning of the month, the conference may be held on Double Ten Day (October 10th).

### Tax Administration Sends Personnel to Inspect Dock Goods - Double Fines for Tax Evasion

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] The Tax Administration recently formulated a method for inspecting goods, tasking local tax authorities with sending personnel to inspect goods at the docks. If any goods with tax evasion are found, the fine will be doubled. The inspection will focus on verification and will not adopt search methods to prevent abuses. In addition, the Tax Administration's tax revenue has improved daily in the past month, especially the consolidated tax.

### Rayon Rises Frantically - More Than 200,000 Yuan Higher Than Last Saturday

Rayon stocks are dwindling daily. Fangjian (probably a company abbreviation) has indicated that distribution will be suspended. Furthermore, due to repeated rumors that rayon to be shipped to Shanghai has completely disappeared, people are panicking, causing the black market price to rise wildly yesterday. No. 120 Tiantong Youguang opened at 2.78 million yuan, with transactions at 800,000 yuan. Afterwards, it rose to close at 870,000 yuan. In the afternoon, because there were many inquiries from manufacturers and actual users, holders were hoarding and raising prices, pushing it up to close at 960,000 yuan, which is more than 200,000 yuan higher than last Saturday. Assorted brands also rose by more than 200,000 yuan. Factory silk of high uniformity and fiber count saw no transactions because the market price did not match the international price. The opening price of the actual demand was high, priced at 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. Yesterday, Qingfeng Silk sold goods worth 75%, priced at 2.7 million yuan. Silk fabrics were strong and beautiful. Huajin crepe followed raw materials up by 100 yuan. Hangzhou goods were active and also rose by 100 yuan.

### Central Bank Posts Daily Exchange Rates for Inward and Outward Trade

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 16th] Regarding the issue of industrial and commercial remittances, the Economic Committee of the Northeast Headquarters decided to handle it in accordance with the "Implementation Measures for Industrial and Commercial Remittances in the Nine Northeastern Provinces" promulgated in mid-September. The exchange rate between the nine northeastern provinces and the interior will be determined by the Central Bank posting daily rates. The exchange rate from the Northeast to Tianjin and Beiping is 1 to 11.5 yuan. The exchange rate from Tianjin and Beiping to the Northeast is 1 to 22.5 yuan. Except for remittances from military and government agencies, which are remitted by the Central Bank at the posted exchange rate, ordinary remittances are temporarily handled by the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank, and the Central Trust Bureau. In the past, public servants' family support remittances handled by the Central Bank will also be handled as ordinary remittances from now on. The difference between the old and new exchange rates will be subsidized by the Headquarters to prevent public servants from suffering losses due to exchange rate fluctuations. Furthermore, the ordinary exchange rate originally changes at any time depending on various factors such as market capital supply and demand, trade exports, and price levels. However, in order to stabilize the financial situation, the Central Bank will strive to keep the exchange rate stable and avoid many changes.

### Rice Market Supply Still Flooding - Japonica and Indica Both Soft

Yesterday morning was rainy. Although the rice market was bullish, it was unable to rise due to the flooding of supply. The situation was firm in the morning and weak in the afternoon, and the result was still flat. Medium-grade indica rice felt quite soft, as was new japonica. White rice transactions were scarce and remained downstream. Mid-grade white rice and new Yinyuan rice suffered from a lack of buyers. High-quality goods saw some inquiries. The future situation is temporarily difficult to improve. White rice in bulk in the Xihe area began to try using Douzi (a measuring tool) yesterday. The supply and demand of flour are balanced. The supply from Minyong and Qingdao to the Animal Husbandry Bureau is scarce, and prices are raised. The market also had little fluctuation. Bran prices were fluctuating. The oil market, due to the arrival of some goods in Qingdao, and factory supplies of soybean oil and rapeseed oil for the Grain United, store interest turned sluggish, and oil prices fell across the board by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Medium-grade soybeans in Shantou saw slight inquiries, and high prices moved slightly. Medium-grade products remained dull. Raw peanuts in Nanyang saw inquiries again, and high-quality goods weakened and turned strong, seeing an increase of 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Medium-grade products in Benjie and the market were still mediocre. High-quality goods were stable, and medium-to-low quality goods weakened first. Yellow hemp rebounded slightly by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan.

### Double Horse Price Unchanged - 2,300 Bales of Yarn Distributed - Yarn Firms Get a Share - Market Is Flat and Lackluster - Piece Goods Sales Are Not Strong - Foundation Is Still Solid

[Our Report] The Silk Factory Joint Distribution Committee convened a regular meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday, selling a standard quota of 20-count cotton yarn. Fangjian received 1,814 bales, and private companies received 491.5 bales. The selling price was based on 1.3 million yuan per bale of 400-pound 20-count Double Horse yarn. Private factories were fully allocated according to their application amounts. In addition to the factories directly producing the textiles, Fangjian will also allocate to yarn firms according to their applications.

The yarn market was calm and uneventful yesterday. Because the Minyue gang had no ships and the route was blocked, large Double Horse yarn saw few inquiries. The market had a dismal outlook. Small and medium-sized yarns were purchased by the Changjiang gang. The supply and demand was balanced and the market was unchanged. The market gradually declined near noon. The initial price of 42-count Blue Phoenix was 2.3 million yuan, which later became 2.24 million yuan. The initial price of old Double Horse yarn was 1.5 million yuan, which later fell by 50,000 yuan. The new Singles initially fell from around 1.4 million to 1.35 million yuan.

The slump in business in the Southern gang is partly due to the lack of control over visa exports. Therefore, they all detour to Jiangxi for transport, which, although time-consuming, is still profitable. However, the inability to transport grain along that line smoothly has affected their revenue.

The cloth market remains old. Blue V-shaped cloth is 62,000 yuan. 3A Rainbow Ball is 62,500 yuan. Unbranded Rainbow Ball is priced at 55,500 yuan. The Dragon Head has not opened. Although the price is 27,500 yuan, there are no goods. Four Gentlemen Serge is priced as high as 65,500 yuan, because Fangjian has not distributed it several times. In short, yesterday the entire market was flat. Sales have not been brisk. Inventory is also lacking. The foundation is still solid.

### Hong Kong's Ban on Cloth Exports Can Stabilize Yarn Prices - Official of Fangjian Says

An official in charge of the business division of China Textile Construction Company recently expressed the following opinions on the Hong Kong authorities' formal order to ban the export of cotton cloth from the 15th of this month: (1) Hong Kong's adoption of this strict measure was implemented at the request of Premier Song Ziwen. (2) Smuggling in South China is extremely rampant, and the smuggling and tax evasion will be eliminated immediately. (3) Smuggled cotton yarn in South China is woven into cloth in Hong Kong and then transported to the South Sea Islands. However, the current exchange rate in the South Sea has not been determined, so it cannot be allowed to leak out at will. The official finally stated that Hong Kong's ban on cotton cloth exports would be sufficient to maintain stable yarn prices.

### Silk Prices

Silk is made from waste silk cocoons. It is used to weave silk tweed and other products. Recently, silk tweed sales have been good, so silk is also traded quite a bit. The price of No. 240 silk is 2 million yuan per picul. The price of No. 260 silk is 2.56 million yuan per picul.

### United States Faces Difficulties in Reducing Tariff Barriers - Many Countries Still Advocate Protectionist Policies

[United Press, Washington, 15th] The high tariff policies adopted by countries such as India, Brazil, Mexico, Chile, and Australia have made the US plan to reduce pre-war trade barriers more complicated. Several countries attempting to industrialize have made it clear that while they support the US study of this issue, they feel that high tariffs are essential to protect their new industries. The US Department of Commerce has suggested that countries reduce tax rates simultaneously. US government trade experts admit that their mission seems more difficult than it initially appeared.

### Autumn Cocoon Loan of 15 Billion Officially Released Today - Farmers Bank and Borrowing Cocoon Merchants to Sign Loan Contracts Today

The company will also meet with Farmers Bank and cocoon factory company officials this afternoon to jointly review the qualifications of borrowers.

Among them, 4,200 piculs of funds will be loaned to manufacturers who obtained loans in the spring cocoon loan. The remaining 800 piculs of funds will be loaned to newly opened silk factories. The principle is 3.5 piculs for old-style silk reeling machines and 4.5 piculs for new-style silk reeling machines. As for manufacturers who violated the spring cocoon loan and manufacturers who did not start reeling silk after purchasing spring cocoons, their autumn cocoon loan rights will be revoked.

### American Stalls - Move to Small World - Opening on October 1

The American goods stalls on Hankou Road and Dahua Road were ordered by the Municipal Government to prohibit setting up stalls on the 1st of this month. At that time, the stallholders once gathered to petition the Municipal Government and other agencies, but were not approved. Now it is reported that the stallholders, in order to plan for their livelihoods, gathered more than 200 stalls and managed to rent the entire second floor of Small World on Fuyou Road in the Nanshi area, as a centralized business place, named World United Shopping Mall, and are actively renovating. It is scheduled to open on October 1.

### Shanghai Cement Factory Dismissals Cause Uproar Due to Pressure from Foreign Goods

Elephant brand cement produced by Shanghai Cement Company was sold throughout the area before the war. Later, due to the retreat of the National Army to the west, it had to stop work. The factory was utilized by the enemy and puppets. In addition, the machine was only damaged but not repaired in the last eight years, and it was unusable. The factory owner, Mr. Liu Guanghong, set out to repair a part and continue operations. Unexpectedly, it was hit by foreign goods, resulting in a collapse. The Longhua factory announced the dismissal of 234 workers the day before yesterday afternoon due to sluggish business, accounting for about three-quarters of the total. This caused strong opposition from the labor side. Yesterday morning, the Cement Industry Union and several workers went to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition, demanding that the factory revoke the order.

### Anhui Tea Specialty Tax - Provincial Government Issues Order for Exemption - Those Who Have Paid Will Be Fully Refunded

In the past, Anhui tea manufacturers faced difficulties in the collection of specialty taxes in counties such as Xiuning, Shexian, Qimen, and Yugui, and the obstruction of the transport of raw tea. They requested the Anhui Provincial Government to order the suspension of collection. Now, the Provincial Government has issued an instruction stating that the special product tax should be collected from the producers at the place of production in accordance with the regulations. Tea manufacturers and traders do not pay the tax. The Tunxi Farmers Bank has also received a similar letter from the Anhui Provincial Government, instructing the county governments to immediately release the detained tea leaves. The money paid by the companies should be refunded in full.

### US Price Limits Make Exports Difficult to Be Brisk

According to the opinions provided by US businesses, Shanghai tea prices are approximately US$6 to US$12 per pound when converted to US dollars. There is no guarantee that it can be sold in the US market for the time being. Therefore, the hope of restoring the pre-war annual sales of 6 million pounds to the United States is difficult to achieve in the short term.

### Head of US Agricultural Mission Hutchinson Says China Should Develop Small-Scale Industries

[US Information Service, Guangzhou, 16th] Dr. Hutchinson, the US director of the Sino-US Agricultural Mission, and Dr. Shen, the Chinese director, jointly hosted a press conference yesterday. At that time, Dr. Hutchinson said: The Sino-US Agricultural Mission believes that the development of small-scale industries throughout China will enable farmers to use their spare time to engage in production. The conference was held here at the US Information Service and was similar in nature to a farewell to the people of Guangdong. The mission will depart from Guangzhou by plane this month via Shanghai to Taiwan. Dr. Hutchinson said: The mission believes that China's most valuable resource is its vast manpower, but it needs to be encouraged. He said: No country with agriculture as its foundation has a high standard of living. Therefore, China should move towards industrialization while improving agricultural methods. China's main shortcomings at present are transportation and irrigation.

### Flour Urgently Needs Transshipment: Chamber of Commerce Appeals Again for Lifting of the Ban

[Our Newspaper Report] The Municipal Chamber of Commerce recently addressed the Executive Yuan again regarding the lifting of the flour transshipment ban. The original petition stated in brief: “We recently received a telegram from the Jinjiang County Chamber of Commerce of Fujian Province, stating: Jinjiang is experiencing a grain shortage, and relies on Shanghai flour for supply. Due to crop failures last year, coupled with the ban on Shanghai flour transport, the grain shortage is particularly severe. As the time between harvests approaches, aid is urgently needed. We specifically request permission to allocate 100,000 bags of flour to be shipped to Jinjiang for emergency relief, etc.” Upon investigation, the matter of lifting the flour transshipment ban has been repeatedly requested by chambers of commerce from various regions. This reflects a real need that cannot be delayed. We have previously submitted a telegram on record. Given the current situation, it is appropriate to forward this to your esteemed Yuan. We implore you to consider the famine and grant special permission.”

### Actual Sales Drive Caustic Soda Prices Upward Constantly

With the arrival of autumn, major dyeing and printing factories in Shanghai are operating around the clock, resulting in a huge consumption of caustic soda. According to market estimates, there are currently over forty small and medium-sized dyeing and printing factories in the city, all of which need to purchase caustic soda. Yarn factories are also in urgent need, with each factory purchasing an average of fifty drums. Including the yarn factories, a total of two to three thousand drums of spot goods need to be supplied at once. Furthermore, merchants from Tianjin, Chongqing, Wuhan, and Jiangxi are all scouring Shanghai for supplies. In the past two weeks, the price has risen by 250,000 yuan per drum. It is reported that most raw material merchants have had their orders for caustic soda from the United States rejected, and foreign firms are unwilling to sell spot goods.

### Record of the Recovery of Chengde

— Central News Agency dispatch from Chaoyang, 9th

Rehe fell to the enemy in the year following the September 18th Incident, held captive for thirteen years. The people longed day and night for the motherland to liberate them. When the Japanese devils surrendered with a thunderclap, men, women, old and young were overjoyed. Last year, during the Mid-Autumn Festival, unfamiliar Eighth Route Army troops arrived. They were mistaken for National Revolutionary Army, and welcomed with joy. After a period of time, they received the "blessings" of this fake National Revolutionary Army, which only brought struggle, and extortionate levies, and the people became lost. During this time of unclear authenticity, the Communist army invaded and occupied Chengde, Chifeng, and various counties in northern Rehe. The National Revolutionary Army recovering the northern frontier was blocked east of Pingquan, and south of Gushan (70 li south of Chifeng). In May, they were forced to retreat from Gushan to Yebaishou, and from then on, the northwest of Rehe was plunged into deep water and scorching fire.

Counterattack Begins, Rapid Advance　Thereafter, the people of Chifeng and Chengde counties, unable to bear the harassment of the Communist army, repeatedly sent representatives to meet with General Shi Jue, the military commander of the National Revolutionary Army, and Liu Duoquan, chairman of the provincial government, requesting a speedy advance to relieve them from their plight. The authorities were always constrained by the ceasefire agreement, and unable to advance. This not only went against the wishes of the people, but also caused misunderstandings among middle and lower-ranking officers and soldiers. Especially after the retreat from Gushan, the officers and soldiers of the 13th Army suffered illegal attacks from the Communist army day and night, and were almost consumed by anger. This time, in order to thwart the Communist army's conspiracy to attack the National Revolutionary Army and open up eastern Hebei, the 13th Army issued an order to advance to meet the enemy. The soldiers rubbed their fists and showed smiles, no longer complaining about their superiors.

The counterattack began on August 27th. The 13th Army was responsible for the northern route, heading straight for Chifeng from Yebaishou. The plan was to recover the territory by September 5th, but the mission was completed on August 29th. The 100 kilometers of rugged mountain roads took only two and a half days. On the same day, the northern route also recovered Gubei, and the next day crossed the Heishui River, reaching Nailin, within the borders of Chifeng. The speed of the advance was sufficient to prove the strength of the National Revolutionary Army. At the same time, Chairman Liu Dongkui personally braved danger, leading the civilian workers to repair the roads along with the army. The residents nearby braved the hail of bullets to carry water to the front lines, entirely out of their own volition. This showed the spirit of cooperation between the military, government, officials and people everywhere, and their hatred for the Communist army.

Beautiful Outline Completely Deformed

In mid-June, this reporter wrote an article titled "Chengde Weekly," introducing the beautiful outline of Chengde. Now, this beautiful city is deformed. The Communist army destroyed and plundered while retreating, leaving the city without electricity, the houses damaged, and the wealth gone. The airport, the smallest in scale and the only one with an asphalt runway in all of Rehe, was also damaged beyond repair. Everywhere exposed traces of the Communist army's thieving acts. However, when asked, the merchants and civilians who had been swept clean said, "Although our belongings are gone, spiritually, it's like a shackle has been lifted." Yes, they feel relieved to have received the army of the motherland.

Although most of the shops in the market have reopened, business is still sluggish for the following reasons: (1) Nineteen out of ten old shops were struggled against and liquidated. For months, the prosperous Nanyingzi Street trade was monopolized by the Communist Party's agency cooperatives. Before the retreat, official and private goods were swept away and plundered westward. (2) The Communist army used the "Legal Tender" extensively, issuing border currency in excess. During the retreat, they plundered the Legal Tender that civilians had saved, and fled with it fully loaded. After the recovery, no one accepted the border currency, and Legal Tender and circulating notes were difficult to use as chips. (3) The Pingquan-Gubei and Jinzhou-Gubei roads are not open, and daily necessities are not easily transported from Beiping or Jinzhou in the short term. This year, Rehe is expected to have a good harvest, and food is not a problem in itself, but Chengde is currently experiencing a shortage. White rice and flour are nowhere to be seen. This is all a temporary phenomenon. After Shi Jue took office as the Chengde Garrison Commander, he calmed the military and civilians while rushing to repair the destroyed buildings. The order of the market is recovering extremely quickly.

Rushing to Repair Day and Night to Provide Support

The highway and railway from Pingquan to Chengde were thoroughly destroyed. The roadbed could not be seen, and not a single sleeper was left. A few steel rails could be seen intermittently, lying crookedly on the distant slopes. Not a single iron bridge was intact. In addition to slogans slandering the head of state, the bridge piers also had white slogans such as "Build a Democratic Country" and "Build a New Rehe." This "build" slogan was painted on the destroyed bridge piers, which could be called a great farce. Wan Guobin, director of the Jinzhou Railway Bureau, and Li Xian, brigadier general and commander of the engineer corps of the Northeast Security Command, have followed the army westward, supervising the staff to rush to repair day and night. The Lingyuan-Pingquan section is expected to be completed within days. If it can be repaired to Chengde, then once the Jinzhou-Chengde Railway is open, Chengde can undoubtedly be declared prosperous. Chairman Liu Duoquan followed the army west on August 27th. After Chengde was captured, he returned to Chaoyang once, instructing the various departments and offices of the provincial government to prepare to return to Chengde. Without even warming his seat, he and Commissioner Li Shoulien led the Chengde, Luanping, and other county magistrates westward in haste. He arrived in Pingquan yesterday, and is heading to Chengde today. Various departments of the provincial government have also transferred a number of personnel to Chengde to take over the relevant business. A provincial government office has been established in Chengde, and it is expected that all personnel can be fully repatriated within a month. According to Chairman Liu's words to the reporter, all preparations are in place, waiting only for the availability of transportation. Chief Education Officer Liu said that "after the schools in Chengde are restored, the greatest difficulty is finding teachers, especially for middle schools." It is said that Chairman Liu is also determined to do his best to improve this. The reporter hereby sends a message to scholars in Beiping and Tianjin to consider this.

Opinions on Selling Sugar at Controlled Prices

This city is selling sugar at controlled prices again, which is truly a blessing for the citizens. Although there have been several sales before, the order was very chaotic. In the end, it was still the young and strong who benefited. Moreover, although the authorities stipulated that each person was limited to three catties, in reality, southern goods merchants used the excuse of general sales and limited each person to one or two catties. There were very few who sold according to the regulations of the authorities. This time, it is stipulated that each person is limited to two catties with their ID card, and the time is extended, with sales also in the morning, so the order is gradually improving. However, using ID cards is still not fair, because ID cards are only issued to people over the age of thirteen, so children under the age of thirteen do not have the fortune to enjoy it. In fact, children need more sugar than adults, especially babies. Therefore, I hope that next time, sales can be further improved, with each household using a household registration card to receive the sugar at once. This would greatly simplify the time and procedures. I hope the relevant authorities will pay attention. (Zhou Li)

Arbitrary Price Increases for Highway Bus Tickets

Editor: There are buses that go directly from Jianbi to Zhenjiang, departing every day in the morning and afternoon. A few days ago, they departed on time, with each ticket costing 800 yuan, and each bus carrying 30 people, selling tickets for 24,000 yuan. Yesterday afternoon, the bus from Zhenjiang to Jianbi, charged 2,000 yuan per person, with 22 passengers, totaling 44,000 yuan. They also did not sell tickets. I went to ask them why they did not sell tickets according to regulations? The staff replied in a nasty voice, "Those who want to ride can ride, what regulations?" I believe Zhenjiang is the capital of Jiangsu Province. Isn't the establishment of the highway for the convenience of the people? (Zhu Youming)

Please Restore Routes 1 and 9 Buses

Editor: I am a resident near Zhaofeng Park. In the past, there were Routes 1 and 9 buses from Zhaofeng Park that could go directly to the Bund, and there were also trolleybuses that could reach Jing'an Temple, which was very convenient for residents. Since the January 28th Incident, the buses have stopped running, relying only on trolleybuses, and the congestion is indescribable. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, public cars have been temporarily replaced in the public bureaus in various places, but only this place is still lacking. Why is the authorities favoring one over the other? The Zhaofeng Park area is a residential area, and residents travel back and forth to the central district several times a day. Moreover, there are passengers from the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway West Station, students from St. John's and Great China Universities, and visitors to Zhaofeng Park. The number of passengers is unparalleled. When Routes 1 and 9 buses were running in the past, it was also very crowded. Now, only three or four trolleybuses run between them. How can they be enough? As a result, visitors to Zhaofeng Park are becoming increasingly deserted. The misery of squeezing onto the bus is like escaping from a disaster. Now, temporary public cars are run every Sunday when the park holds concerts. It seems that the establishment of this car is only for the convenience of listening to music! If the cars could run according to the old Route 1, then the passengers at the trolleybus stops at Jing'an Temple, Seymour Road, Carter Road, and Chengdu Road would definitely not be so crowded. I hope the authorities will think twice. (Xu Bing)

Many Door Numbers Are Confused and Unclear

Editor: The door numbers of the shops and households along the lanes north of Zhongzheng Road are all made of tinplate, painted with white background and black characters. After years of disrepair, they have become unrecognizable. In many places, each household has two door numbers with different numbers. There are even those who deliberately remove the door numbers. I don't know what the purpose is. The door number is one of the addresses, which should not be ignored. I hope the relevant authorities will start to improve this immediately. (Zhang Qiu)

Unclean Lanes Hinder Hygiene

Editor: I am a student and live in Xicheng Lane, Ximen Road, Madang Road. The lane was originally very clean, but recently the entrance and bottom of the lane are extremely dirty. The reason is this: The street sweepers in the lane, citing that their salaries cannot be maintained, have gathered their fellow villagers and relatives to set up steamed bun stalls, etc., at the entrance of the lane, causing oil and water to splash everywhere and obstructing traffic. There was originally a wooden house at the bottom of the lane for the street sweepers to live in. Recently, they claimed that it was not easy to find a house, so their accomplices have been using the area next to the wooden house as a place to live, and storing a large amount of straw, raising chickens and ducks, and unlicensed fierce dogs (events of biting young children often occur). As a result, the stench is overwhelming, and cooking is done there, which is very easy to cause a fire. I hope the relevant authorities will take action to maintain local hygiene. (Cai Zhiping)

### Heavenly Soldiers and Generals Flying All Over the Sky: Paratrooper Drill in the Capital

— Nanjing, 6th, Yang Yanbing

At the reception for reporters hosted by Chief of General Staff Chen of the Ministry of National Defense, the reporter received a report from another colleague that the Paratrooper General Team would hold its first grand exercise in Nanjing the next day. This valuable clue excited the reporters too much. Quietly thinking about tomorrow's wonderful festival, and at the same time, guessing whether they would let us look at the "heavenly soldiers and generals" descending to occupy the land from the air? The mind was concentrated and the spirit soared, and the whole night was spent in turmoil.

Early in the morning of the 5th, the reporter woke up in the roar of engines, and looked at his watch, it was already 7:20. Hurried, hurried, he rushed to complete the entire grooming and housekeeping in three minutes. He took a car and desperately went to the gathering place at Xinjiekou. At this time, there were not many people on the street. News vendors shouted along the street. When the car passed Zhongzheng Road, I saw the cars of colleagues driving towards Zhonghua Gate one by one. The car drove faster after leaving Zhonghua Gate. The reporter was in the closest car and was the first to arrive at the review location of the Paratrooper General Team, and couldn't help but be extremely excited!

At this time, I could see rows and rows of paratroopers neatly arranged on the large parade ground. The reporter followed the signpost and went to the inspection ground. The receptionists greeted with smiles and gave out today's program. On the signature book, I discovered that Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi, General Jiansheng was also here. Minister Bai has been busy with military affairs, and I have not seen him for a long time. Being able to see his demeanor again today is another gain from participating in the grand ceremony.

At 8:00 AM sharp, Minister Bai led Lieutenant General Ma Chongliu, Lieutenant General Xu Tingyao, and more than 30 inspection officers and entourage forward to the inspection ground. At this time, Commander Ma of the Paratrooper General Team had rushed from the defense area in Suzhou to accompany the inspection. Minister Bai nodded frequently as he walked to each row, appearing very happy. Afterwards, he visited the internal affairs, parachute folding practice, asked many questions, and gave instructions. When visiting the weapons, General Ma Chongliu explained the latest American rifle to Minister Bai. Minister Bai picked up the gun and made an anchoring motion, and smiled at the reporter: "I joined the army at the age of twenty, and have always been accustomed to using a rifle. Today, I picked up this American rifle, and it is completely different from the rifle I used thirty years ago. Scientific progress is truly overwhelming."

### The Growth of Seedlings, a Sign of National Rebirth

Immediately, he visited basic parachuting. The reporter thought that the growth of this seedling of national defense is a sign of the rebirth of the Republic of China. He excitedly asked Minister Bai about the future goals of paratrooper construction, and he told the reporter: "The Chinese paratroopers were established in 1943. In the past two years, the war exploits of attacking Hengyang, Danzhu, and Guilin were truly too great. We must make these batches of seedlings grow well. We are prepared to expand into many divisions and many armies to take on future national defense missions."... At 10:15, he visited battlefield psychological testing. A heated and wonderful scene unfolded on a field of several hundred meters. Dozens of soldiers practiced crossing the battlefield in a crossfire of landmines, artillery shells, and bombs. At this time, the firepower was dense, the sounds were continuous, and landmines and bombs exploded at the same time. The fireworks of red and green flares enveloped the Chen terrain. Dimly, I saw soldiers crawling forward on the field, as if facing a great enemy. Minister Bai asked the reporters several times, "Is the action good?" His words seemed to contain unlimited joy. Immediately, he visited. The combat exercises were also extremely impressive. Minister Bai said to the reporters during the proceedings: "Are there any reporters from the New China Daily today? We would be very welcome if they came to see us." This aroused a burst of smiles from the reporters.

At 11:30, the visit was over, and after a brief refreshment in the reception room, he took a car and returned to the city.

### Air Force Parachuting, the Program Is Special and Wonderful

At 1:30 PM, at Ming Palace Airport, he visited Air Force parachuting. This was the most brilliant and unprecedented program in the capital. The emotions of the paratrooper soldiers were hotter than the scorching autumn sun. They were about to present the beautiful postures of combat in the skies over Guangdong, Luoding, Xijiang, and Hengyang to the millions of citizens and senior military officers in the capital. At this time, there were people everywhere inside and outside the Air Force Transportation Station. Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force, Lieutenant General Zhou Zhirou arrived the earliest. Minister Bai also came with his wife and two sons. Lieutenant General Ma Chongtian, Lieutenant General Xu Ting??, Lieutenant General Zhang Zhen, Police Chief Han Wenhuan, and a special car from the Ministry of National Defense loaded ten officials came. In addition, there were dozens of female relatives. Three large Model 47 aircraft faced the reviewing stand. The 36 soldiers participating in the parachuting were assigned to three special aircraft, No. 302, No. 297, and No. 296, with twelve people on each aircraft. When they were disembarking to board the plane, the reporter group seized the opportunity and requested to visit the plane. As a result, the nine reporters were divided into three groups, with three people on each aircraft. I walked into the aircraft door with joy and curiosity. After a while, the engine made a loud noise, and the aircraft slowly rose. It circled in the air first, and the commanding instructors Chen Zhonggui, Huang Kai, Wang Keqiu, and Yang Derun led the singing of "Paratrooper Song." Most of them had fought in Kaiping, Guangdong, and had risked their lives in the flames of war. Today they deserved to be proud. Looking down from the window again, the fields and streams were scattered like stars. The Yangtze River was like a belt, and Qingliang Mountain and Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum gradually passed by.

### A Lily Drifting in the Air

After only about five minutes, we reached an altitude of one thousand feet. A series of rapid bells rang from the tail of the aircraft, indicating that this was the signal to start parachuting. Then a rubber man for measuring wind direction was pushed out of the aircraft door to test the wind direction. The people in the cabin quickly looked at the posture of the landing. The first person to perform on Aircraft No. 302, which the reporter was riding, was Instructor Bird Qifa, a captain. He made a ready-to-jump posture in front of the aircraft door. The two instructors next to him checked him. The aircraft made a large circle and had already reached above the Ming Palace. Captain Bird immediately jumped out of the aircraft door, and the two assistants were busy collecting the buckles. Everyone crowded to the aircraft door to watch. A beautiful lily was drifting in the air, slowly falling, and looked even more vivid, white, and beautiful in the sunlight. When the aircraft circled back and forth around the city and returned to the Ming Palace, the audience applauded continuously. After that, they jumped in groups of two and three. Each student opened the parachute three seconds after jumping out of the aircraft door. The diameter of the parachute was six feet. Lilies appeared in the clear sky, one after another. I couldn't help but salute the commanding instructor. When the fifth time they returned to the sky above the aircraft hangar, all twelve people had jumped. The driver, seeing that the mission was completed, headed towards the Ming Palace Airport to land. At this time, it was exactly 2:00 PM. The last time, twelve people landed simultaneously from two aircraft. The beautiful umbrellas were pure white, yellow, red, and green, slowly descending. What poetic works of art they were!

Finally, Minister Bai delivered a speech expressing his thoughts on the review: "These are the seedlings of our paratroopers. We must make them grow strong. Paratroopers are the newest type of scientific soldiers. We must build them up and coordinate with our national defense."

### Black Sea Situation

— Our newspaper's Beijing-based reporter, Ding Weidong

Recently, the Black Sea situation has been very dangerous. The Soviet Union has formally proposed a demand for joint Soviet-Turkish defense of the Dardanelles Strait. They view it as a matter for the Black Sea nations, and do not want Britain, the United States, and France to participate in the negotiations. Britain, the United States, and Turkey, on the other hand, believe that this is an international issue, and any amendment to the Montreux Convention should be conducted through an international conference, and cannot be decided by the unilateral will of the Soviet Union. As of now, more than a million Red Army troops have gathered on the borders of the two countries, and a war of nerves is already underway! There is a chorus of resistance in the Turkish parliament. The United States has bluntly warned the Soviet Union that controlling the straits and controlling Asia could lead to war. The clouds of war seem to be looming again over the war-torn skies of Europe.

The political system of a country may change, the governing figures may change, but the historical background and geographical situation of a country will not change. Whether it is Tsarist Russia or the Soviet Union, the fact proves that the national aspirations of Russia will not change. Therefore, to understand the essence of the strait issue, it is better to seek it in Russian history than in grand diplomatic rhetoric.

### "Constantinople World Hegemony"

The rise of modern Russia defeated two strong enemies in total. Under Peter the Great, he defeated Sweden, which dominated Northern Europe at that time, and obtained ports on the Baltic Sea. The "window" to the north was opened. In the south, Peter the Great's successor, Empress Catherine, repeatedly defeated Turkey, expanded its territory, and made Russia a Black Sea nation. Throughout the 19th century, Russia was committed to a southward policy, with the ultimate goal of obtaining Constantinople and controlling the Black Sea straits. In 1805, Napoleon of France dominated Europe, and defeated Russia on the plains of Poland, but in order to defend against Britain, he turned around and courted Russia, and the two sides signed the Treaty of Tilsit. The effect of this treaty was to divide the European continent into the spheres of influence of France and Russia. Western and Central Europe belonged to France, while Eastern and Northern Europe belonged to Russia. Everything went smoothly during the negotiations, but when the Russian Tsar mentioned Constantinople, Napoleon suddenly interrupted him and said heavily, "Constantinople? This is an issue of world hegemony!" The two sides negotiated repeatedly, but never reached an agreement. This unresolved issue eventually became the seed of the breakdown of French-Russian relations in 1812. From the Congress of Vienna to World War I, Balkan wars occurred frequently. In addition to ethnic hatred, the desire of Tsarist Russia to weaken Turkey and control the straits was an important reason.

### The Straits Story: Endless Vicissitudes

At the beginning of World War I, in order to win over Russia and tie up German forces to prevent their concentration on the Western Front, Britain and France had agreed that after the war, Constantinople and the Black Sea Straits would be given to Imperial Russia as spoils of victory. St. Petersburg was overjoyed upon receiving this promise. In 1916, the Russian army suffered defeats on the Eastern Front, causing morale to waver. At the same time, due to Turkey's entry into the war, Russia was unable to receive supplies from Britain and France via the Black Sea route, putting it in a very difficult situation. At that time, the French ambassador to Russia (a historian and writer) saw lines of new Imperial Russian recruits in Petersburg during the snowy winter. These pitiful replacements were poorly clothed, some even barefoot. Due to a lack of rifles, some were even unarmed, struggling through the snow on their way to the front. The ambassador asked himself: How could Russia, in this critical situation, still have the confidence to continue fighting? His conclusion was, "The beautiful prospect of Constantinople is what guides them forward!"

Britain still holds the view that Turkey's attitude was quite hesitant during the First World War, and that its alliance with Germany was due to a chance occurrence. On the eve of the war, Turkey had ordered warships from the British Admiralty, but once the ships were completed, the European war situation had already developed, and Britain kept the warships for its own use, causing displeasure in Turkey. When the war broke out, two German warships escaped the search of the British Navy, entered the Black Sea Straits, and docked in Constantinople. This series of events became the spiritual capital for Germany to win over Turkey. Later, during the war, under Churchill's advocacy, Britain launched the so-called "Dardanelles Adventure," which resulted in heavy casualties and a disappointing retreat. However, historians later argued that if this operation had succeeded, Turkey would have certainly surrendered, which would have accelerated the defeat of the Central European powers and ended the European war two years earlier! After the end of the European war, Turkey and Greece went to war. The Greek invading forces retreated from the Turkish interior all the way to the straits. The Turkish army pursued them northward and could have crossed the narrow strait to recover its old territory in Europe, but the British Navy blockaded the straits at that time, waiting in battle array. Churchill wrote vividly in his memoirs: "The Admiralty had absolute confidence that it could prevent the Turkish army from entering Europe purely through naval power." After the Treaty of Lausanne was established, Turkey obtained an opportunity for self-reliance, but the straits became an undefended area, leading to the relocation of the capital of the new Turkey. The historical lesson of this World War is enough to prove that the Black Sea Straits are the lifeline of Turkey's national defense. If the straits fall into the hands of another country, Turkey's independence will exist in name only!

### Britain and the US Advocate Joint Control

In this war, Turkey responded to the crisis with vigilance and autonomy, ultimately avoiding being drawn into the vortex of war. Although it did not participate in the war, the entire country remained in a state of mobilization from June 1940 onwards. The American Lend-Lease Act was also applied to Turkey. According to the British-Turkish Mutual Assistance Agreement, if Turkey were attacked, British air force from bases in Africa could reach Turkish airspace within five minutes. Turkish air force bases were completely transformed by British and American experts to facilitate the stationing of the air forces of both countries at any time. In fact, although Turkey did not participate in the war, it shielded the Middle East and indirectly contributed significantly to the Allied nations. During this war, Turkey's relationship with Germany and the Soviet Union was quite delicate, and two incidents occurred that were never fully resolved. The first was the attempted assassination of the German ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, in the Turkish capital. Berlin said it was done by Soviet personnel with the aim of causing a Turkish-German war and facilitating the entry of the Red Army into Turkish territory. Moscow said it was done by German special agents with the aim of creating a pretext for German aggression. Turkey's attitude was one of silence, and the case was never solved. The second was Germany's publication of a batch of documents and maps related to the Soviet Union's territorial demands on Turkey, which caused a great uproar. Germany insisted that the materials came from the Soviet Union and were very reliable; while Moscow strongly condemned the Nazis for undermining Soviet-Turkish relations. Throughout the war, Turkey was cautious, fearing imminent disaster, and fundamentally distrusted both Germany and the Soviet Union. As soon as the war ended, the Soviet autonomous republics immediately demanded territory from Turkey, causing the Turkish authorities to maintain a large army and dare not demobilize!

At the Potsdam Conference, the Soviet Union formally proposed the demand for joint defense of the Dardanelles Straits. It based this on the principle of "international equality." Here, the so-called international referred to the three great powers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and not to other countries. At the conference table, Stalin pointed to Churchill and said, "The Suez Canal is a vital waterway for your survival, and you have occupied and defended it." Then he pointed to Truman and said, "The Panama Canal is a vital waterway for your survival, and you have occupied and defended it; therefore, according to the principle of international equality, the Soviet Union has the right to demand the defense of the Black Sea Straits." Britain and the United States unanimously opposed this demand and advocated international control. Churchill said at the time: "If the straits become a Soviet naval base, only Russian ships will come out, and no British ships will go in!"

### The Northern Bear Is Obsessed with the Ocean

In addition to fulfilling historical desires, the British and Americans have a new observation regarding the Soviet Union's obsession with controlling the straits, which is that the Soviet Union has developed a very deep interest in the ocean. By the Yalta Conference, Byrnes had already sensed this. Subsequent developments confirmed this. In the East, the Soviet Union had already acquired the Lushun naval base—the Gibraltar of the Yellow Sea. In the West, the Soviet Union supported Yugoslavia in acquiring ports on the Adriatic Sea. The port of Trieste is an important Central European seaport, and the shipbuilding facilities and skilled workers there could be utilized. Regarding Italy, it demanded one-third of the fleet and naval bases in North Africa. It was expected that it would demand a large portion of warships, merchant ships, and fishing boats from Japan as reparations. Joint control of the Black Sea Straits would allow the Soviet Union to become a Mediterranean power, developing its influence in Africa and the Near East. The Northern Bear also wanted to control the ocean, which, of course, conflicted with the interests of Britain and the United States, who regarded the ocean as their lifeline. In addition to other important political and military reasons, this is one of the motivations for Britain and the United States' firm support for Turkey.

### Crimes of Japanese War Criminals - From Our News Data Room - The Poisonous Executioner: Konoe Fumimaro

When the name of Konoe Fumimaro, the chief culprit of the invasion of China, is mentioned, all Chinese people gnash their teeth with hatred. Although he is dead, how can we allow such a vicious executioner to "die and be done with"?

Konoe's latent power in Japan was considerable: He was born in 1891 and raised under the care of Prince Saionji. He had attended the Paris Peace Conference with Saionji and had long inherited Saionji's mantle, joining the ranks of Japanese "elder statesmen." He organized organizations such as the Toyo Society and the Nanyo Society, secretly preparing to launch a war of aggression against China. After Hayashi Senjūrō stepped down, Konoe rose to form a cabinet and launched the "North China Incident" upon taking office, mobilizing three divisions and over a hundred aircraft to attack Peiping and Tianjin. On the one hand, he flaunted the so-called "Konoe Three Principles" and the "policy of non-expansion," causing incalculable losses to the Chinese army and people. However, his conspiracy was finally exposed under the guidance of our wise supreme leader in the War of Resistance. Following this, there was the so-called "Konoe Statement," which put forward the slogans of the "Greater East Asia New Order" and "long-term warfare," all of which were thoroughly refuted by our authorities, forcing him to announce the collapse of his cabinet.

In June 1940, seeing Germany's military successes in Europe, Konoe took office again to form a cabinet, completing the proud masterpiece of the "Japan-Germany-Italy Military Alliance." After the outbreak of the Soviet-German War, Matsuoka Yōsuke was dismissed, and the Konoe cabinet was reorganized, even more recklessly pursuing militarism, and the arrogance of the warlords was unparalleled. After Hiranuma Kiichirō was assassinated, Konoe's third cabinet collapsed again.

In summary, from his rise to his fall, he formed a cabinet three times. His first cabinet led to the Sino-Japanese War; his second cabinet colluded with Germany and Italy, leading to international isolation; after his third cabinet failed, Tōjō Hideki came to power, leading to the Pacific War.

Please see the following excerpt from Konoe's conversation with Wang Jingwei: "The Japanese government has repeatedly declared in its statements this year that it will thoroughly eliminate the anti-Japanese National Government by force, and at the same time is willing to work hand in hand with enlightened Chinese people to move toward the construction of the East Asian New Order. Japan, Manchukuo, and China will jointly realize good neighborly friendship, joint anti-communism, and economic cooperation." The Chinese people suffered greatly under Wang Jingwei's tyranny, much of which was Konoe's "achievement."

After the victory, Konoe suddenly appeared in a pro-British and pro-American posture, frequently courting the Allied forces, and promoted constitutional amendments, hoping to emerge again to form a cabinet. He even fantasized about coming to China to "apologize." But this could not cover up his heinous crimes. On December 6th of last year, Konoe was "at the top of the list" of war criminals to be arrested by MacArthur. Finally, on the morning of the 16th of that month, he committed suicide by taking poison, leaving behind a will that continued to make excuses, claiming: "In due time, there will be public opinion on right and wrong!" He can be said to have been unrepentant until his death.

### Old Fascist: Hiranuma Kiichirō

Konoe's second cabinet collapsed because he could do nothing about the war expenses in China, the international atmosphere was bad, and the fascist military was dissatisfied. The one who succeeded him, shouldering the heavy responsibility of "creating a new order and maintaining permanent peace in East Asia," was Baron Hiranuma Kiichirō, who served as prime minister for only seven months.

Hiranuma was born in 1867 and graduated from the Law Faculty of Tokyo Imperial University. He served in the Ministry of Justice. In 1911, he was appreciated by Justice Minister Matsuda Masahisa and appointed Vice Minister of Justice. In 1912, he served as Prosecutor General of the Supreme Court for as long as eight years. In 1921, he was promoted to President of the Supreme Court. In 1923, when the Yamamoto cabinet was established, he served as Justice Minister, establishing an unshakable power in the judicial field. In 1924, he was appointed Privy Councilor, and in April of the following year, he was appointed Vice President of the Privy Council. In 1933, he served as President of the Privy Council.

Hiranuma was the leader of Japanese fascists. He founded the Shūyōdan (Cultivation Group), serving as its director, and in 1924, he founded the Kokuhonsha (National Foundation Society), serving as its president, advocating "Imperial Household Centralism" and publishing "Kokuhon" and "Kokuhon Shimbun." Its members included bureaucrats, military officials, nobles, and people from all walks of life. Suzuki Kisaburō, Tōgō Heihachirō, Gotō Shinpei, Araki Sadao, Koiso Kuniaki, Matsui Iwane, Kikuchi Takeo, and zaibatsu Ikeda Seihin, and bureaucrat scholar Yamakawa Kenjirō were all members of the society. He also collaborated with Araki Sadao, vigorously attacking the Seiyūkai, and tried several times to form a cabinet, but failed due to opposition.

In 1939, Hiranuma finally fulfilled his lifelong wish at the high age of 73, but within two months of taking office, he was heavily criticized from all sides. The cabinet became an appendage of the military, with no power to interfere in foreign policy, and everything was controlled by Army Minister Itagaki and Education Minister Araki. In August of the same year, he resigned. In 1940, he briefly served as Minister of the Interior, and later as Deputy Prime Minister. In 1945, he was reappointed President of the Privy Council.

On December 2nd of last year, Hiranuma was among the 59 war criminals ordered to be arrested by MacArthur. This 80-year-old fascist "meritorious official" was finally thrown into prison, awaiting trial by the International Tribunal.

### Violent Black Dragon: Hashimoto Kingorō

Hashimoto Kingorō was originally a standard Japanese rōnin, but in the militaristic Japanese fascist government, he actually became a remarkable figure.

Hashimoto was the leader of the "Japan Youth Party" and the head of the "Black Dragon Society." He absurdly styled himself as a superior Nazi, once saying that "National Socialism and Fascism are like the stars and moon in the evening sky, which can only be adorned more clearly in the morning light of Great Japan." The famous writer John Gunther called him "the founder of the one-party idea, an extremely violent young military officer." Because of the support of his "Black Dragon Society" behind the scenes, he often lived in robbery, assassination, and espionage, creating his terrifying reputation.

When he served as an adjutant at the Turkish embassy in 1927, he was already obsessed with studying German and Italian Nazi politics. In 1936, due to the rise of his Youth Party, he formed a fascist government combining civil and military bureaucrats, and issued a declaration of the "Leaping Great Japan National System Outline" (also known as the Hashimoto Kingorō Declaration), shouting the slogans of "Emperor First" and "National Control and Management."

In 1937, he rejoined the army, commanding a fleet of warships to invade China, creating the horrific Nanjing Massacre, and directing the bombardment of the American gunboat "Panay" and the British gunboat "Ladybird." He authored numerous works, publishing articles in the "Taiyō Dai-Nippon" magazine and other publications, and giving public speeches. The book "The Inevitability of Reform," which has now been submitted to the International Tribunal as evidence, is his "masterpiece," revealing his immense joy when he drowned our soldiers in the Yangtze River, and his desire to drive out British and American forces in China to realize Japan's monopolistic plans. He also often used conspiracies to overthrow civil and military officials whom he considered to be "lacking in ambition." In 1940, he was also the founder of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association.

This lawless warlord has been tried in the Tokyo International Tribunal, and everyone hopes that this "Old Black Dragon" will be given the most severe punishment!

### Isolated City in Northern Jiangsu: Hai'an

— Zhenjiang, 7th Dispatch, Wang Hanou

When the reporter and local merchants walked out of the earthen city of Hai'an, they saw large numbers of Communist leaflets and slogans scattered on the ground. Everyone was filled with fearful apprehension. According to one or two people with ulterior motives, they also saw militiamen secretly reconnoitering in the distant woods. Whether this was true or false, the fact that there was Communist activity as soon as one left the earthen city was indeed true. Moreover, before this, Hai'an had shown signs of being surrounded; at night, the sound of hand grenades and machine guns became a regularly performed rhythm. But the garrison and residents did not pay excessive attention to it, only calmly dealing with it with the word "calm," which is the only good way to deal with the Communist military strategy, and the only good way to adapt to the current environment. Because after the National Army opened the Tongyang Line, it needed some reorganization and deployment in preparation for the next phase of operations, and it did not extend northward. Each town along the highway did not have "satellite" strongholds. As soon as the Communist military launched a "counterattack," they immediately approached the city, and there was no better way than to resolutely defend it with deep trenches and high ramparts.

Neat fortifications

When the reporter was in the town, the bunkers and fortifications in the earthen city were built neatly. The 65th Division was stationed in the town, and everyone inside seemed to be engineers, able to work as plasterers. The brothers carried bricks and mixed mortar themselves to build bunkers. They lived in civilian homes, and each outpost had a short protective wall built in front of it. Obstacles were piled up on every street and alley, preparing for all street battles. These bricks and stones for building fortifications were dug up from road bricks in the back streets and alleys, wooden door panels were temporarily requisitioned from residents, and a small number of tile and wood craftsmen also participated in the work.

Grain storage and death defending

When Hai'an District Chief Wang Jingyi convened a meeting of citizens, he announced that the entire town's residents would collectively store 12,000 dan of grain in preparation for a month-long siege. Each guild would supervise each merchant, and each baojia chief would supervise each household, trying to search for and store grain until the quota of 12,000 shi was filled and the food supply was sufficient. When the reporter was in the town, the residents all received temporary passes, and went out of the city every day to buy rice and grass from nearby villages. The lowest price of new rice was once as low as 34,000 yuan, but soon rose again to 45,000 yuan per shi. Grass then rose to 89,000 yuan per dan, equal to the price of large wheat at 130 jin per shi. Many people chopped up old furniture for cooking fuel, which, although painful, was said to be more cost-effective than "buying at expensive prices."

Roads extend in all directions

The earthen city of Hai'an was built by the puppet army during the period of occupation, and cost a lot of civilian blood and sweat at that time. When the New Fourth Army "liberated" the area, because they felt that the area was "indispensable," this earthen city was not only not demolished, but also processed and repaired, until the Communist military withdrew from the town, it was intact. In addition, there were two moats inside and outside the city, which was fully suitable for the conditions of deep trenches and high ramparts. What "indispensable" relationship did Hai'an have? It is the transportation hub connecting the southeast, northwest, south road to Tong (zhou) Ru (gao), west road to Yang (zhou) Tai (county), east road to Peng (cha) Li (bao) into the sea, north road to Dong (tai) Yan (cheng), directly to Huai (yin) Hai (zhou), and all these lines can be reached by road these days. In short, Hai'an is the center of transportation. With it, one can control the overall situation. Without it, a large section of the highway line would be forced to be completely abandoned.

Democratic lawsuit

Han Guojun, the former governor of Jiangsu Province who was comparable to Wu Peifu during the War of Resistance, was born in the town. When the local area fell in 1930, Han took refuge in a northeast village. He was kidnapped by enemy troops sent to the village to force him to take a puppet post, but Han resolutely vowed his allegiance and was unyielding in the face of danger, eventually dying for his ideals. Han's style name was Zishi. The New Fourth Army's "Democratic Government" hypocritically renamed the town "Zishi County" to commemorate his labor, but because his daughter, Han Liuqi, was one of the local capitalists, she was also arrested and subjected to a "democratic lawsuit" when the struggle was launched this spring. It was not until the Battle of Northern Jiangsu was about to begin that she was released. Now Ms. Liuqi is also in the town presiding over the Joint Military-Civilian Affairs Office and the Chamber of Commerce, planning to restore local affairs.

Battle of Fengshan

Newspaper telegrams intensely report on Mount Lushan, but there is no Mount Lushan in Hai'an, nor is there a North Mount Lushan. It is probably a mistake for Fengshan in the northeast corner two miles away from the town. Fengshan is one of the three ponds and ten scenic spots in Hai'an. The scenery is beautiful and shaped like a phoenix. Climbing the peak can overlook the entire city. In order to control the war situation, both sides must swear to defend this high ground. Part of the temples on Fengshan were demolished by the Communist army, and the three ponds and ten scenic spots have already shown signs of incompleteness. The Communist military's method of destroying temples is indeed terrible. The Guangfu Temple in Hai'an is one of the 24 forests in Xiahe. The architecture is even more magnificent than the Jing'an Temple in Shanghai, and it was also torn apart by the Communist military. The "religious freedom" declared by the Communist military's "Democratic Government," I don't know where this statement went.

Residents waiting to be fed

Hai'an is currently an important place in the battle for North Jiangsu. The military and civilians are defending the city to the death. Although the offensive of the Communist military's 12 regiments has weakened and the situation has become looser, external transportation has not yet recovered, and all industries are in a state of suffocation. The citizens deal with war and life every day, and prices are surprisingly high. Since the National Army advanced to the present, they have not received any relief supplies. It was previously reported that the Jiangsu-Ningbo branch of the Relief Headquarters had 500 tons of flour shipped in, specifically to relieve the disaster areas of Jiang, Qu, and Hai, but the highway in the Qutang area was cut off, and it is temporarily difficult to transport it in. The general poor people are like "carp in a dried rut," looking forward with longing eyes.

### The Common Disaster and Oppression of the Flood in Haizhou

— Special Dispatch from Haizhou by Our Newspaper, 3rd. Correspondent: Li Shangnong

Haizhou, in the past a remote corner, has become the heart of northern Jiangsu and the gateway to the coast since the opening of sea trade and the construction of the Longhai Railway. It is now a major hub for military, political, cultural, and economic activities in the Huaihai region. It boasts hundreds of miles of fertile fields producing soybeans and wheat in the front, vast salt fields in the rear, and the Tongyun Grand Port, a major hub for goods, attracting attention from both domestic and foreign sources.

Currently, all local military, political, cultural, and financial institutions are located in Xinpu, which is twelve Chinese miles from Haizhou City, resulting in unusually prosperous commerce. Land transportation includes the Longhai Railway, Qinghai Highway, and Huaihai Highway. Water transportation offers direct routes from Lianyungang to Shanghai, Qingdao, Guangdong, Dalian, Xiamen, and other places. The Yunyan River provides inland navigation to Qingjiang. Before the incident, the China National Aviation Corporation had an aviation station in Haizhou, with daily north-south flights landing to carry passengers and transport mail, making transportation quite convenient.

During March and April of spring, the refugees' only hope was that the Communist army would quickly withdraw from the Haizhou territory, allowing people to return home to harvest wheat. By the time the wheat turned yellow in May, refugees from the various counties of Haizhou had spontaneously organized homecoming teams to return home to harvest wheat. Unexpectedly, all the returning teams were driven back by the Communist army's guns and artillery, and the wheat they had planted was harvested and transported away by the Communist army.

The displaced refugees, seeing that the wheat had been reaped by the Communist army and their livelihood destroyed, although they received flour from the Relief Administration and local authorities made efforts to provide relief, it was a mere drop in the bucket. Everyone still suffered from hunger. Many refugees fled from Xinpu to the south of the Yangtze River to find a way out. There are still 44,706 refugees in Xinpu, which is more than one-half fewer than in the spring. These more than 40,000 refugees look forward to returning home every day, because autumn has already arrived, and they will soon need cotton clothes. If they cannot return home, it will be even harder to bear the cold and hunger.

Disrupting Transportation and Blocking Food Supplies

After occupying the county towns of Shu and Gan, the Communist army violated the ceasefire order in January, disrupting transportation and occupying Baitabu on the Longhai Railway, as well as westward locations. They forcibly conscripted young men, killed family members who evaded military service, and repeatedly attacked outposts outside Haizhou, such as Xinba and Zhangwu, as well as Gezhuang near the outskirts of Guanyun County, which was also frequently attacked by the Communist army.

Although the Communist army did not cease attacks on outposts surrounding Hai and Guan counties, the local militia, under the command of General Duan Linmao of the National Army, defended with composure. Each time the Communist army attacked, they suffered heavy blows. The National Army in Haizhou launched a movement to save one meal to provide relief to refugees in Hai and Xin, with the army and civilians loving each other like family, sincerely united to defend the Haizhou base of the Huaihai area. Seeing that Haizhou could not be captured, the Communist army strengthened its blockade policy. Because the grain-producing areas were occupied by them, what we defended was only the county towns of Dongguan and Xinpu, Lianyungang, and other suburban areas, with very little grain production. Since the food and fuel were blockaded by the Communist army, food prices soared, causing public panic about food, and other prices also rose.

Haizhou was blockaded by the Communist army on three sides, north, south, and west. Only the sea off Lianyungang to the east allowed for traffic in and out, with ships traveling to and from Qingdao, transporting cloth and sundries. If it were not for the seaport of Lianyungang, even breathing would have been suffocated.

Originally, there were 700 stores, companies, and salt businesses of various kinds in Xinpu, and commerce was very prosperous. After the city's new outskirts and the Longhai Railway were occupied and blockaded by the Communist army, commerce plummeted, and stores closed one after another. As commerce declined, industry also fell into decline. Other peddlers and small businesses were unable to operate due to the interruption of traffic. There were seven or eight thousand unemployed and idle people in Xinpu. Many unemployed and poor people did not have a single meal a day, and their faces were pale, filling the corners of the new city. Local government officials and school teachers, due to low salaries and high prices, mostly worked on empty stomachs, truly experiencing unspeakable suffering. The only people who lived happily were the uncaptured traitors, profiteers who made a fortune from the national crisis, and a few corrupt officials who profited from victory. The rest of the people lived in misery.

Digging Dikes and Releasing Water to Submerge Autumn Crops

Because the Communist army in the Huaihai area suffered defeats in the northern Jiangsu battles, they disregarded the lives of the people and dug up the dikes of the Shu and Yun canals. The waves surged, and floods flowed horizontally. Except for the mountainous areas, the entire territory of southeast Xuzhou and Haizhou became a swamp. The people's houses and livestock were washed away and drowned in large numbers. The half-ripe beans, sesame seeds, sweet potatoes, and other autumn crops in the fields were all submerged, with a flooded area of more than 300 square miles.

The Communist army in southern Shandong, intending to flood Haizhou City and Xinpu, also dug up the dikes of the Yi River in Linyi County, causing the river water to flow eastward and merge with the waters of the Shu and Yun rivers, overflowing into the Hai and Xin areas. The Wei River north of Xinpu was silted up for years, hindering drainage, resulting in water depths of several feet in the suburbs of Hai and Guan counties. The highway from Haizhou to Xinpu was cut off, and the Yangyu airfield was in danger of being submerged.

The local military and civilians in Xinpu were deeply concerned that the Yangyu airfield and streets would be flooded, so they joined forces on the 23rd and 24th to rush to build the Yanyan River embankment outside the Xinpu West Bridge and blocked several breaches in the airfield embankment. Under the scorching sun, the military and civilians worked hard, sweating like rain, showing no fatigue. Although the flood could not submerge Haizhou, the interruption of the food and fuel supply for hundreds of thousands of people in the Hai, Guan, and Lian areas is the most serious problem at present.

### Reader Q&A on Medicine and Health

(1) Lingering Athlete's Foot

Ping Shun: I started working in a different place in the autumn of the 32nd year [of the Republic, i.e. 1943]. Because the place was humid, in the summer of the following year, my feet (lower legs) felt rough. I fried and ate machine-milled rice bran, and took "Sanyou Industrial Society Athlete's Foot Medicine," which slightly reduced the swelling. In July of last year, the swelling of my legs returned as before. At that time, due to economic reasons, I used a folk remedy of eating several catties of boiled light red beans, but it was not effective. May I ask: (1) What is this exactly? What is the cause of the disease? (2) What is the impact of athlete's foot on the body? (3) Are there any effective medicines and preventive methods?

[Answer by Medical Doctor Yu Xinen] If it is athlete's foot, it will harm the heart. Injecting Vitamin B1: Injection medicine is very effective. In addition, a urine test should be done to see if there is kidney disease.

(2) Eye Pain

Pan Xilai asks: My elder brother suffered from trachoma several years ago, and it occurs every spring and autumn. It starts at five o'clock in the morning and stops at twelve o'clock. It does not cause redness or swelling when it occurs. He has to take painkillers one hour in advance to stop the pain. It recurred this summer as before, and painkillers are also ineffective. (1) If this continues, is there any danger to the eyes? (2) Is eating chives the cause of the disease? (3) Is this disease hereditary? (4) Is there any medicine that can cure it completely?

[Answer by Medical Doctor Yu Xinen] You should go to an ophthalmologist for examination and treatment, and do not randomly take medicine.

(3) Bladder Prolapse

Xu Mingjin asks: I am 33 years old and work as a shop assistant. I suffer from a left bladder prolapse. It is painful when it is severe, but it returns to normal every morning after a good night's sleep. It recurs when I overwork. The pain is more severe after eating. It has been almost a year, and I don't know why. Because I live in a remote rural area, there is no good doctor to seek help from. Please give me a treatment method.

[Answer by Medical Doctor Yu Xinen] What you are suffering from is a small intestine hernia. Surgery is the radical cure. You can temporarily use a T-shaped belt to lift the scrotum, especially when working and walking.

### Visiting the Father of the Three Suffering Sisters in Changshu, Gui Zhongfei

Living in Desperate Straits, Lonely and Helpless, It Is Truly Pitiable

Editor: My father, Gui Hong, alias Zhongfei, is 33 years old this year. He disappeared in the spring of the 30th year of the Republic [1941]. The reason is this: In January of the 26th year [1937], my mother died due to childbirth! In the autumn, because of the Japanese invasion, my father, grandmother, and I, along with my two younger sisters, fled to the countryside. Later, on a small boat, we lived a wandering life, having been to Gaoyou, Rugao, Nantong, Yancheng, and other places. I don't know when, perhaps in the autumn of the 29th year [1940], we arrived in the colorful Shanghai. This is heaven for the rich and hell for the poor. Three months after arriving in Shanghai, unfortunately, the three of us sisters all broke out with rashes. Beset by poverty and illness, and unable to find a job, my father spent every day borrowing money. Fortunately, our sisters' illness slightly improved. In order to reduce the burden on her beloved son, my grandmother returned to her hometown of Changshu, where the cost of living was relatively low. At that time, Changshu was still occupied by the Japanese. My father was afraid of being humiliated by the Japanese, so he stayed in Shanghai. At first, we still corresponded, but finally, one of my letters to my father was returned. I asked people to inquire, but it was in vain. Until now, it is still unknown whether he is alive or dead. Before I knew it, my father had been missing for a full five years! The three of us sisters lived a few years of childish life under the care of our grandmother, but heaven seemed particularly harsh to us. In the autumn of the year before last, it also took my grandmother away. The changes in our lives after my grandmother's death are beyond description. In short, our path to survival is almost over! I hope every day that my father can see the newspaper and return quickly to save his daughters from the depths of misery. At the same time, I also hope that kind people who know the whereabouts of my father will write to "Gui Mei, c/o Doctor Yi Mei, No. 47 Jiaotong Street, Changshu." I am a 16-year-old girl who just graduated from junior high school last year. Due to economic reasons, I did not continue my studies. My Chinese is not very good, so I would like to ask the editor to correct it and publish it as a favor. I respectfully wish you good health. Orphan Gui Mei, Fen and Rong together.

Women and Family

### Family Menu

— De

As the cost of living rises every month, the lives of salaried employees are increasingly strained. Housewives find it a great hassle to manage the diet. If you buy more side dishes, the expenses are too high, and if you buy less, it is not enough to eat. I think housewives of salaried employees in the current environment must be very troubled by the problem of buying side dishes. I will now try to draft a menu for this week, based on a family of four or five people, with daily side dish expenses of around 3,000 yuan, with three dishes and one soup. I hope this can serve as a reference for housewives:

Monday: Stir-fried Pork Liver with Water Bamboo Shoots, Glass Noodle Soup with Dried Shrimp and Fried Tofu, Sautéed Edamame Pods, Braised Pickled Vegetables in Plain Oil

Tuesday: Meat Stewed with Eggs, Stir-fried Beef with Flat Beans, Pickled Vegetable and Dried Shrimp Soup, Stir-fried Tofu with Water Bamboo Shoots

Wednesday: Stir-fried Pork Liver with Preserved Mustard Greens, Braised White Shrimp with Tofu, Stir-fried Flat Beans, Pickled Vegetable and Edamame Soup

Thursday: Stir-fried Pickled Vegetables with Edamame, Stewed Egg Soup, Stir-fried Baiye with Small White Vegetables, Stir-fried Onion with Shredded Beef

Friday: Braised Small Yellow Croaker, Pickled Vegetable and Shredded Pork Soup, Glass Noodle Braised with Pickled Vegetables, Stir-fried Yam, Edamame, and Gluten in Vegetarian Style

Saturday: Dried Shrimp and Mushroom Soup, Braised Diced Pork with Edamame, Stir-fried Lotus Root Threads, Braised Tofu with Chicken Feather Vegetables

Sunday: Fried Gluten Stuffed with Meat, Clear Stewed Crucian Carp Soup, Stir-fried Chicken Feather Vegetables with Edamame, Stir-fried Water Bamboo Shoots

### The Position and Attitude of a Daughter-in-Law

— Li Ying

Our country is a land of etiquette with a splendid history of five thousand years. Ethical concepts have always existed with dignity. Parents love their children, children respect their elders, husbands and wives are harmonious, brothers are respectful and fraternal. Every family is very harmonious. However, often many families, after marrying a daughter-in-law, have estrangement and jealousy, turning the harmonious atmosphere into one full of gloom and resentment, so that the entire family is not happy. Why is this?

Our ancestors lived under a large family system. Even now, the large family system has not been eradicated. In cities, only men and women with newer ideas have broken free from the shackles and established small families. "Large" and "small" are not changes in the system, but rather a shift in the perspective of 20th-century life. In large families, being a daughter-in-law is the most difficult and unrewarding job. She is surrounded by in-laws and sisters-in-law. If her husband has many siblings, she becomes the target of everyone, often the subject of their jokes, the object of cold ridicule. And what about her? She can only endure. She knows that this is an inevitable stage in life, and a natural result of the old system. Apart from gaining a little comfort in front of her husband, or placing all her hopes on her children, she can only get through it by silently accepting her arranged fate. She believes, "Years of being a daughter-in-law, years of being a mother-in-law, and then years of being a great-grandmother." She knows what it is like to be a daughter-in-law, and what it is like to be a mother-in-law. After tasting enough of the daughter-in-law's experience, she treats her daughter-in-law the same way. Instead of saying treatment, it is more like revenge. Generation after generation cycles through, until the increasingly innovative next generation can no longer endure this kind of "endurance," then there is strife and resistance. Those who can be independent break away and form small families, but most who continue to muddle along naturally have an even worse environment.

After organizing a small family, her position is invisibly raised. Now she is not a daughter-in-law but a wife, or even a mother. She is no longer restrained. A wife is equal to her husband. In addition to appropriate service and consideration, she does not need excessive service and submission, and no one deliberately bullies her or makes things difficult for her. Of course, this kind of life is not without small flaws, such as when economic difficulties are felt, when there are guests and she is too busy to manage, when there are too many children to care for, etc. Having family together can at least help her a little, but compared to the benefits, it is ultimately not a big deal.

Now it is time to talk about attitude. In large families that cannot be avoided, elders should use forgiving, loving, and optimistic eyes, holding the spirit of not being foolish, not being hypocritical, and not being an overbearing head of the family. Moreover, children and grandchildren have their own blessings, so there is no need to be jealous or curse. And those who are daughters-in-law should always remember that they are their elders, and should be filial and respectful, understand the psychological abnormalities that exist in the elderly. And being together every day, what's the point of tearing each other apart? With the attitude that both sides take a step back, they will definitely be able to live harmoniously, peacefully, and happily.

Although, to this day, we really don't need to maintain the large family system.

### Three Prohibitions in Child Rearing

— Yunyu

The following are three important things about child rearing that I hope mothers will pay special attention to:

(1) Do not let people kiss your child. Many people often like to kiss children because they love them. This is a very common thing, and most mothers do not pay attention to it. In fact, we know that when kissing, the air exhaled by each other will be inhaled into each other. If the person kissing the child has a disease, it can be easily transmitted. If you want your child to stay healthy, quickly prohibit people from kissing your child!

(2) Do not deceive or scare your child. Children are curious. When they encounter something they have never seen before, they will ask, "What is this?" "Why is it like this?" Mothers should tell their children the reason why. If you don't know, answer frankly that you don't know. You must never deceive them with lies, or even threaten them. If the questions raised by children are often deceived or threatened, then the child's mind will be full of falsehood and fear, and their curiosity will also decrease or even disappear. Think about it: If people have no curiosity, how can all science and technology be improved day by day? I hope all mothers pay extra attention.

(3) Do not let people touch your child's genitals. Many people often like to touch boys' genitals, and most mothers think this is unimportant. If this continues day after day, it can easily cause the child to masturbate when they grow up. Everyone knows the drawbacks of masturbation, so there is no need to elaborate. At the same time, children must also be absolutely prohibited from touching their own genitals.

### The Key to Beauty - Protecting the Skin

— Qing

Often some women, although they have very slender figures, because the foundation on their faces is applied too thickly, do not show any luster of the skin when they smile, completely like a colored plaster statue, unable to express any expression. At this time, if someone sees it at a glance, they will definitely feel very uncomfortable and feel a kind of pity for their skin.

We can be sure that a woman's appearance first focuses on the face, and the beauty or ugliness of the face depends on whether her skin is bright and smooth. Speaking of this, maybe someone will ask a question again, how can a woman's skin maintain its luster and radiance?

To maintain the beauty of the skin, we must first be able to protect the skin, so that it does not suffer damage from external stimulation. Anything that contains a large amount of lead, as well as too little sleep, are the most likely to irritate the skin. Therefore, women who usually like to apply relatively thick foundation that contains a lot of lead often have rough skin and enlarged pores. A woman who suffers from insomnia or stays up late often has rough and dry skin, and that's the reason. Therefore, the first important thing to nourish the skin is to carefully protect the skin.

Secondly, keeping the skin clean is also a way to nourish the skin, so within the possible range, it is best to avoid contact with dirty and dusty places, because unclean things contain a toxin that can absorb the skin's oil and make it dry. If this is not possible, then after you come back from walking, use clean warm water and soap to wash away the dust on your face, which is also a remedy; but after washing away the dust, the original oil on your face also fades away with the soap, so at this time we should use some nutrients to nourish it, such as egg white, glycerin, and the juice of fruits such as apples, oranges, and tomatoes, which are all good raw materials for nourishing the skin. (The above-mentioned ingredients are best used before going to bed, replacing soap to remove dirt. After getting up the next morning, wash with water, and the skin will appear radiant and smooth.) In addition, when the weather is cold in winter, you can apply lipid-based cosmetics (cold cream) to the face to prevent the skin from cracking.

If a woman's facial skin has reached the point of being clean and delicate, then apply a thin layer of foundation to her skin to cover up excessive oil on the face and remedy the sallow complexion, and then apply a small amount of rouge on this thin layer of powder, which can make the skin show a vivid and healthy beauty.

### Using Life to Teach Children

— Translated by Cheng Zhi

(1) The Branch Roads of Life

When I was young, I often argued with my younger brothers, even quarreled, because we were all stubborn and did things our own way.

One day, Father took us to the train station to play. We saw a train speeding towards us from both sides, and at the same time, a freight train was also rushing westward.

"What do you think will happen if two trains travel towards each other on the same track?" Father asked us.

We widened our eyes, thinking a terrible crash was about to happen, but as we watched, the freight train switched onto a branch road, letting the passenger train speed by safely.

"Look, children!" Father explained, "People are like trains, we are all moving in different directions on the same track. If there were no branch road facilities, there would be rifts between people, just like a train crash. Fortunately, we have many such facilities, such as patience, friendship, and tolerance. Therefore, between children, between adults, and even between countries, if they can always remember the branch roads in life, they will be more harmonious."

(2) Every Shot Counts

My father has allowed me to buy my first .22 caliber rifle. For many days, I have been flipping through the mail-order catalogs, and finally decided to choose a fully automatic one that fires fifteen rounds in succession. So I asked our bodyguard, Ping Jun, to agree to my choice, but he looked at the picture of the gun, then smiled and turned to me and said, "If I were you, I wouldn't want this one."

"Why?" I asked, suppressing my disappointment.

He said, "I think a single-shot is better. Every time you see this single-shot gun, you will think, if this shot doesn't hit, there will be no second chance. But, using an automatic is different, you no longer pay attention to the importance of each bullet, and as a result, you can't do the best you can."

Ping Jun's theory is indeed perfect. From then on, whether in career or in social life, I always think of his words, every shot counts.

(3) The Face and the Inside of the Watch

I remember one day when I was eleven years old, I returned home crying, because in the children's program at church, I was only assigned an insignificant backstage role. But my playmates were assigned the lead roles.

Mother quietly took out her watch and placed it in my hand.

"What do you see?" she asked me.

"The gold case face and the hands," I replied.

Then she opened the back of the watch and repeated the question. I now saw very small gears and screws.

"If any part is missing, even the ones you haven't seen yet, this watch is useless."

Her little lesson has made my life happier ever since, because I realize that everyone's work, even without others' admiration, is just as important.

Spring and Autumn

### Rossetti

— Pang Duoer

Dante Gabriel Rossetti was a poet and a painter. He dedicated his life to art, founded the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, and led poets and artists of the late Victorian era, such as William Morris, Burne-Jones, and Swinburne, to engage in independent creation. His paintings are as famous as his poems. However, it is more accurate to say that there is painting in his poems, rather than poetry in his paintings. Because the main point of his paintings is color and atmosphere, not the narrative of actions.

Rossetti's artistic talent stemmed from his lineage. His father was an Italian writer who sought refuge in London because of his revolutionary ideas. His mother was born from the combination of an Italian and an Englishman. Therefore, all four of the Rossetti siblings possessed Italian artistic talents, and all achieved considerable success in art; however, Dante Gabriel, as the eldest, enjoyed the greatest fame.

Rossetti was born in London on May 12, 1828. At that time, his home was a gathering place for Italian fugitives. From a young age, he witnessed the activities of political figures, which instead made him develop a distaste for politics. He even lacked enthusiasm for Italy's independence movement. His love for Italy was solely for its literature and art.

Rossetti entered art school at the age of fourteen and the Antique School of the Royal Academy at eighteen. In addition to painting, he also loved Browning's poetry. At this time, he began to understand medieval culture and society, and translated many Italian medieval poems and Dante's *Vita Nuova*. Published, it became Rossetti's first work, and also the standard English translation of early Italian poetry.

In 1848, Rossetti formally founded the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood with his friends Holman Hunt and Millais, advocating the restoration of the pure and simple style of Italian painters before Raphael. This was a reaction against the craftsmanship that valued skill and adhered to conventions at the time. Their conclusion was: Raphael's painting skills were too perfect, making it impossible for later generations to develop their own paths, thus causing art to decline. Therefore, to reform art, it is necessary to transcend skills and express the soul, and first return to the artistic atmosphere before Raphael, and then create freely in order to achieve results. In their paintings, the themes, colors, structures, and various details are all different from those of their contemporaries, and they do not seek to please the mundane world. The most obvious point is that they disdain the superficial harmony of colors, and only use basic, strong colors. They also expressed this spirit in poetry. Their publication, *The Germ*, contained Rossetti's most famous poem, "The Blessed Damozel".

At this time, Rossetti met a young girl, Elizabeth Siddall. She had a slender figure, blue-gray eyes, full lips, and golden hair, which met the conditions of a medieval beauty, causing Rossetti, who loved ancient beauty, to become infatuated. He used her as a model, painting famous works such as Beatrice. Eventually, Rossetti married her. However, his temperament was so eccentric and his life so irregular that she felt extremely lonely and soon contracted lung disease. One night, when Rossetti returned home, he found his wife dead in bed. In grief, he buried all his manuscripts of poetry from recent years with her to show his repentance. Many years later, he listened to the advice of friends and exhumed the manuscripts from the grave.

In 1854, Rossetti met the famous critic Ruskin. Ruskin greatly supported him, establishing his position in the art world. Subsequently, Morris, Burne-Jones, and others were all influenced by Rossetti and abandoned their studies to paint. Later writers also admired and imitated him. However, after losing his wife, he gradually felt unwell physically and mentally. At that time, Buchanan and others attacked his poems, saying that they focused too much on describing the senses of the five organs and were overly immersed in sensual pleasures. Their ridicule made him feel very embarrassed, but he continued to write until he died of a stroke in 1882 at the age of fifty-four.

His poems are all written in a very casual style and contain the same idea, that is, men love women, symbolizing God's love for humanity, and the loveliness of women symbolizes the beauty of the soul. He believed that "life" is "love," and "life" and "love" are the same thing, because "love" is the driving force of the universe, and without "love" there is no "life."

### Vivisection of the Heart

— Zhang Baihuai

"One evening, I saw you with your head lowered in dejection, wandering on the green field paths. Later, I saw you enlarging your throat and singing fervently. Are you making an expectation, or are you doing some necessary search?"

"No, I'm just following my own high notes."

"Then I would like to feel melancholic for your song. Just like the adorable morning sun facing the lonely building window. But did you notice us walking past you from behind at that time? And she whispered, your eyes must be fascinated by some difficult thoughts."

"Fascinated, yes, but why did you just walk past like that?"

"You were pondering at the time, saying that you were standing on the ruins of time and wanted to use the golden bricks of love to rebuild the desolation you saw. But you hesitated between yesterday and tomorrow, fearing that you would only pick up a prosperous dream. She almost couldn't help but laugh, but we finally didn't disturb you."

"I really don't understand why I fear the paleness of the soul, even the emptiness of thought. In these days, have you also seen me wandering in the loneliness of the depths of my heart?"

"Lonely people have no love, and you, the fire of love has burned your life red."

"Alas, although I say that I understand the meaning of life more than before, I have not yet turned to such a difficult-to-understand and chaotic chapter in the book of emotion. I ask all my friends, but until now, no one has been able to comprehend it. They all say that the wordless sentences are too vague, hidden and difficult. So, I have been doubting for a long time, doubting that it describes an unfortunate child who once used weakness and tears, angrily but powerlessly throwing pain into the forest of languid fate…"

"You are too indulgent towards yourself, but now it is a terrible demand."

"But a poet told me this, he said: When you are unable to continue forward, you stand by the road and see the pedestrians. I think this is the real cruelty."

"This time you have trusted yourself too easily."

"No, no, am I really so ignorant of myself? I walk on a narrow valley path, and what grows beside it is not lush flowers and trees, but thorns and bushes. Walking in the four directions, front and back, are not pedestrians and travelers, but wild beasts and leopards…"

"That's because you no longer have the will to continue climbing the road you dreamed of!"

"I really haven't thought about wavering and retreating, but my passionate heart is so lonely."

"Then have you heard a poet say? His sorrow is also his joy at the same time, perhaps your pain is also your sublimity at the same time."

"Yes, it's better to comfort myself like that. I remember I secretly thought, if someone really wanted to take themselves apart for dissection, and before they started, they declared that the life being dissected had already died, as a review of the final existence, perhaps no one would be willing to be cruel and give him a severe spiritual reproach…"

"But, is this your whole being?"

"Alas, you must be surprised by my poverty. What I think is profound and what I express is superficial, perhaps because I have lost too much and gained too little!"

"I don't want to spend too much time exploring the secrets of your heart. You can be proud of the dirty pearls on your forehead, and not be ashamed that you have not done better for more people. Go, if ridicule and jealousy continue, you will mercilessly throw a cold heart at them with the hatred of truth!"

### Heine's Tragic Life

— Li Xia

Heinrich Heine was a romantic and passionate poet, but his life was one of suffering and misfortune. Between the duality of contradictions, he endured hardships all his life and could not turn over. Material and spiritual, ideal and reality, love and hate, passion and coldness, self-esteem and disappointment, these two-headed snakes of contradiction constantly attacked him.

"My heart, my heart's sorrow.

Although illuminated by the clear May sunshine,

I wander and lean under the linden tree,

Beside that high old city.

My chest is surging like the sea,

There are also hurricanes and tides,

Although it is said that there are beautiful pearls,

But it is a deep seabed."

……Homecoming Memories

The above little poem reflects the poet's inner sorrow. The poet was born in 1797 in the city of Dusseldorf on the Rhine. The city was originally German territory, but at that time it belonged to French rule, so in his "Memorandum" he said:

"I was born at the end of the suspicious eighteenth century, and my childhood was not only French, but also born in a city dominated by the French spirit."

And as Jewish parents raising him, it was exactly two extreme forces. The mother was a diligent and practical woman with a German style. Because she had the mentality of making her son an official, she ordered him to study law. However, the father was a cheerful, hedonistic, and optimistic person with a French style, and did not give any effective facilities to the education of his son. In such an atmosphere, the poet Heine began his contradictory life.

Relying on his mother's will, the poet moved to Hamburg at the age of nineteen to engage in the study of law. For a time, he dreamed of becoming a lawyer or a school professor in the future, and he also spent three months of first love. In particular, the result of this three-month first love had to embark on the tragic of the fate. In fact, the other party admired by the poet did not hold any such feelings. The scars of this painful experience first cast a black shadow on his poems. In the first half of his first collection of poems, "Book of Songs", the tone of painful sorrow for the past nightmare is permeated.

When he left this "cradle of distress," Hamburg, it was in the summer of 1819. Because he received the assistance of his uncle, he entered the University of Bonn to study law. In Bonn, he made many friends in the student union with a high degree of patriotism. He saw the student union disbanded, and he participated in the grand victory memorial festival of Carl Ludwig Sand, so the thought of resistance struggle gradually became extremely in his mind.

In the spring of 1821, he began to live in Berlin. In this prosperous metropolis, he was more deeply affected by both the bright and dark sides. But the problem that he felt particularly painful here was the concept of racial discrimination. As a Jew who was repeatedly subjected to embarrassing contempt, he expressed his anger and aversion in everything. Here, he gradually strengthened his anti-resistance atmosphere, and finally participated in the "Jewish Cultural Science Association", wrote articles, and even carried out his propaganda activities everywhere.

In 1825, he finally passed that annoying graduation exam and got a doctorate. And with the help of his uncle, he went to the North Sea again. The sea is what the poet especially likes. Due to the guidance of the sea, he finally crossed the sea to England. The sea gradually led him to the embrace of nature, promoting the wanderlust of this born wanderer. As a result of his roaming, he wrote masterpieces such as "The North Sea" and "Harz Journey", and published the work "Book of Songs" in 1827, which established his poet's reputation.

But the ideological and political opinions expressed in the collection of poems aroused opposition and attacks from backward forces everywhere. Even some parts were banned from sale by the Prussian government, and the pressure of disillusionment and misfortune gradually increased around him. So the poet arrived in Paris, France in May 1831.

The first impression in Paris was very strong and fresh. The nostalgia for Raf Antiero, Rousseau, Napoleon, and all other great French past was surging in his chest like a tide. It is even more interesting than everything else is the new religious theory of Saint-Simon. This theory enabled him to find a mediation between the democratic views he had always held and the emerging aristocratic artisticism. This theory advocates abolishing the old inequality, and replacing it is the expectation of a new class built by the ability of personality without following the tradition. At the same time, due to the love and cohabitation of Mathilde, a twenty-year-old girl, his passion burned even more, so that he could regard the suffering of the people as his own suffering, and take the people's social progress as his urgent vanguard.

"I am a sword, I am a flame. Please put a sword on my coffin. I am a brave warrior in the human war of freedom."

He was shouting like this, although he was rejected by the Parisians. However, he finally stood up as a savior of his motherland, and stood up as a supporter of the people.

But Heine was ultimately a "art for art's sake" poet. Because he was born with sensitivity, the degree of his love and hatred often had to go beyond the norm. So the poet's later poems replaced the happiness he had previously gained in poetry with ridicule and humor.

After 1842, he had a severe attack of chronic disease, which eroded and numbed the poet's hands, feet, and even eyelids. The later life of the hemiplegic poet became even more bleak. But precisely because of the disease, he had more time to fantasize, and finally wrote a narrative poem. After eight years of long suffering on the sickbed, he finally ended this "defeated" life on the morning of February 17, 1856.

### The Tree and the Eagle

— Chen Ji

A young cypress tree, standing with its broad chest, stood in the boundless vast grassland, shaking its upper body and laughing freely all day long, singing heartily. All he saw was the happy blue sky and the happy white clouds.

One evening, the purple twilight shrouded the grassland, and the sun shed its haggard yellow hair. A piece of darkness swept over the branches of the pomelo tree, and the young singer felt melancholy. At this time, a large eagle flew over, flapped its wings and rested on the branches of the pomelo tree, with fresh red blood still dripping from its chest. It was dark, and the eagle cried sadly in the bleak night wind.

"Hey, is there anything in the world that hurts you?"

"In the world, oh friend, there are too many sorrows for wanderers in the world, and too many conspiracies for cruel people. They are jealous of me flying freely, and secretly, they aim their guns at me…"

"Don't people love freedom and happiness?"

"Oh friend, people want to kill freedom and happiness!…"

The next morning, the pomelo tree looked up to sing to the rising sun, but the sun did not come out, and the sky was full of gray clouds. The eagle fell from the tree like a stone, lying on its back at the foot of the pomelo tree. From then on, the eagle closed its bright eyes and no longer flew high, and the pomelo tree also lowered its head and became mute.

Again in the evening, a fat city merchant came and ordered two people to saw off the young pomelo tree. In its own panicked shouts, the pomelo tree broke its upper body and fell on the grassland. So the workers carried the tree and picked up the eagle and took them to the city to sell them. And the grassland was empty, losing its young singer!

Days went by, seasons changed, and rain and snow constantly washed over the grassland, leaving no wood chips from the tree or bloodstains from the eagle!

Wait for the roots of the pomelo tree to grow branches and stems again, and the era will be newly changed!

### An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of River, an Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng 35

This special agent leader in Beiping seemed quite shrewd, but unfortunately he encountered a troublesome problem at this time, and he was pacing around there, unable to handle it, and he was so distracted. His way of dealing with me was very similar to that of the "pig" deputy captain, offering as much high-quality tobacco, alcohol, and food as possible.

"Based on my humble opinion, your Excellency's tour is probably nothing more than the issue of the deputy captain of the Third Team of the 131st Liaison?" He wanted to get my tone with some tipsiness and cunning. He used the word "Your Excellency" because the identity I fabricated was equal to his.

Who is the deputy captain of the Third Team of the 131st Liaison? You probably still remember the "pig" who was killed by Little Tiger using grappling techniques to pull out his throat. The matter was only twenty-odd hours apart, and that scene was still active in my memory, of course. But I was surprised when he suddenly mentioned it to me.

"What's going on?" I pretended to be a little drunk and as if I knew it all along.

"This matter was allocated by the headquarters. Your Excellency came from the headquarters, don't you understand? …Perhaps you look down on me, because my position is very ordinary, so you are not willing to confide in me." He put on a close and very flattering look.

"The matter happened in your area. I started from Fengtian. The fastest trip would take one or two days. I'm afraid I wouldn't have received the news so quickly!" I was still vague, but I paid close attention to his expression.

"Although it is slow to come from Fengtian, can't you take a plane? Besides, with my humble eyes, I can determine that your Excellency must have come from Tianjin. The headquarters must have telegraphed your Excellency. This is still just a guess. In fact, the small intelligence of our area notified us of your Excellency's arrival early." He said, giving a fake laugh, but he was afraid of being too presumptuous, so the fake laugh stopped halfway and he apologized repeatedly.

"I have heard some rumors about the matter," I said, putting on a serious face, since he insisted that I was a commissioner sent by the headquarters to investigate the case: "I still need your Excellency to explain the whole case from beginning to end, so that I can decide what to do next, because the matter has been reported to the headquarters, it's always a bit troublesome, and it's also your Excellency's responsibility!" I took the opportunity to scare him and at the same time decided to take advantage of the opportunity.

"Regarding the case, I received an order from the marching headquarters of the 106th Division this morning, saying that Kiyono Shiro, a deputy captain of the Third Team of the 131st Liaison, and a driver from the same team, have disappeared at the same time." This guy was indeed scared, and immediately put away his smile. "I immediately ran to the Third Team's garrison to investigate in person. According to the clues reported by several people present in the Third Team, and together with a military intelligence officer from the 131st Liaison, we tracked down the missing vehicle. Then we found two bodies drowned in the water, which were the missing persons themselves."

"Isn't that murder?" I deliberately speculated to see if he wanted to muddle through the matter casually, or if he wanted to get to the bottom of it. "Are there any injuries—such as knife wounds or gunshot wounds?"

"It looks like a murder. The injuries…are…" He rolled his eyes and paused for a moment, "Because the bodies were swollen…"

"Murder must have a mastermind, so who is the mastermind?" I knew he hadn't paid attention to the injuries, so I was eager to know their relationship with me and Little Tiger.

"The difficulty lies in this point. It is said that the deputy captain was ordered to escort two senior officials sent by the headquarters to Beiping to handle important business; one of them is a special agent from Manchuria, a young man only twenty years old."

"Maybe these two are the masterminds?" I deliberately pressed forward.

"In fact, it is probably impossible, because the deputy captain made it very clear in front of his headquarters subordinates and soldiers; he said that they were two distinguished guests, one was a special commissioner from the headquarters, and also his classmate and old friend…"

"So, the bodies of these two distinguished guests…oh, haven't their traces been found?"

### The Life of a Musician

— Jia Hui

One of the most popular songs, "Silver Threads Among the Gold," was written by Hart P. Danks as a love song for his wife, but he sold the rights to the publisher for only fifteen dollars. Later, he and his wife quarreled and separated; he died poor and lonely in a dilapidated shack in Philadelphia. On a wooden table next to his deathbed was a small note that read: "Growing old alone is hard."

Free Talk

### Plain Tea

— Shao Fu

Since the investigative teams have gone to work in various places, there is hardly a place where problems have not been found. We hear about these endless corruption scandals every day, and besides feeling sad, we also feel suffocated. What conclusion will be drawn from this phenomenon is self-evident; it is extremely dangerous!

Some people regard the investigative teams as plain tea teams, as something light and bland, thinking they are merely helping to stir up conversation. Although the investigative teams in various places are working fairly and earnestly, such as Mr. Liu Wendao having the courage to catch tigers, and Mr. Qian Gonglai having the determination to receive tears, they really cannot investigate everything, and there are too many people involved. When the deadline arrives, they are handed over to ×× to continue handling and finishing the matter.

After careful study, the main obstacle to the investigative work in various places so far is "no original inventory list." Without the original inventory list, how can one investigate whether the takeover conforms to the records? However, as far as we know, every enemy-puppet organization, factory, or school at the time had an original inventory list, especially the Japanese. They knew about future compensation issues, and that these transferred materials would be used to offset the compensation, so they would never be sloppy in the slightest. As for the puppet organizations, they were naturally terrified and hoped to be pardoned for their efforts in safekeeping, so they made everything clear. In this situation, if there is no original inventory list, we dare to assert that there must be doubts. Therefore, the investigative team can sell what is turned over, but cannot lightly gloss over it with this reason.

It has been a full year, and we are still wallowing in taking over, handling, and investigating, in a chaotic and dizzying state, which is really disheartening.

Occasional Musings

### Everyone Fears Death, Everyone Dies - Let's Talk About How to Live Long

— Yang Yongzhang

A mouse, even if it doesn't die in the claws of a cat, its lifespan is only three or four years. If you can prove that there is a mouse in the world that has indeed lived for ten years, you will immediately be surrounded by many scientists studying the problem of life. A ten-year-old mouse is undoubtedly considered long-lived; but if the dead person in the small coffin also happens to be ten years old, no one but a madman would say that he is long-lived. This suggests to us that longevity does not only refer to the length of years, because this has a great relationship with the species of the animal. The standards for humans and mice are certainly different, and even among humans, they are not the same. Leaving aside other things, it is said that the lifespan of the yellow race is relatively short. Japanese statistics show that only about 150 out of every thousand people can enjoy a lifespan of seventy years, but there are indeed many long-lived people in countries such as Bulgaria, Finland, and Norway. This has a considerable relationship with geographical conditions (such as climate and temperature); at the same time, they all pay attention to personal hygiene. Physical health preservation can certainly affect lifespan, and psychological changes, personal outlook on life, and lifestyle are all related to lifespan.

In addition to individual conditions, heredity is also important. "Like father, like son." There was a centenarian in Burgen who was 160 years old, and his son was already 103 years old. In a court in a certain place in the United States, in order to resolve a lawsuit, witnesses were summoned. He brought two sons with him, the older one was 102 years old, and the younger one was already 100 years old. His own age is self-evident. In a Vienna nursing home, doctors investigated 700 elderly people who were already eighty years old and learned that the parents of these elderly people were also mostly over seventy years old. Now I tell you that if your father can live to be ninety years old, you may (not necessarily) also be a centenarian in the future.

On the death certificates of patients, doctors write those terrible disease names, but medical scientists are eagerly hoping for the day when medicine can not only treat diseases, but also make further progress in preventing diseases, because diseases often destroy people's lives, making them unable to live long. Although doctors cannot create life, if people are not attacked by diseases, longevity can be obtained without effort.

Bacteriologist Metchmikoff believed that the bacteria in the human large intestine are the main cause of "short life." You may want to find a way to kill all the bacteria in the intestine to ensure longevity, but in fact this is fundamentally impossible. The bacteria in the large intestine are an indispensable medium for digestive function, and there is no way to remove the bacteria, but at least maintaining the health of the stomach and intestines can make people healthy. The reason why vegetarians live longer is because fermentation is less likely to occur in the intestines (meat is more likely than vegetables).

Nutrition can also affect longevity. Do you think a malnourished person will live long?

Some people argue that the weight of the brain is also related to lifespan, the heavier the longer, but this cannot be proven yet.

Longevity, longevity, people all hope for longevity, but in fact, I think too much longevity loses the tension and fun of life. Imagine if everyone could live to be a thousand years old, this world would probably be even worse.

I do not seek longevity, I only hope to strive to create my own fulfilling life in a short period of time.

### Also Talking About Plagiarism

— Wen Zongkong

Literary plagiarism was discovered in ancient times, but it mostly belonged to poets. They occasionally extracted one or two good lines from the poems of their predecessors to make their own works more colorful. The purpose was to steal some fame, and there was no idea of profit. For example, He Xun's poem "Thin clouds emerge at the edge, the first moon crosses the middle." Du Fu changed four words, "Thin clouds rest at the strict edge, the lonely moon turns in the waves," and it became a Du Fu poem. Also, Lin Bu's poem "Bamboo shadows slant across the shallow clear water, osmanthus fragrance floats in the yellow dusk moon." Changed "bamboo" to "sparse" and "osmanthus" to "dark," and it became his plum blossom poem.

But today, the trend of plagiarism is flourishing, and there is a distinction between open and smuggled. The former is like the "Digest" publications published on the market. They have only two purposes: (1) Because readers cannot easily see all the good articles, they implement a wide search and selection, collecting and publishing them to facilitate readers' reading. (2) Because of this, their expenditure on manuscript fees can be saved.

Often, there are some degenerate writers who, under the threat of life, feel that it is difficult for their substandard articles to be accepted and published by editors in general newspapers and magazines, so they have to take risks and use despicable brains. They flip through better articles that have been published elsewhere several years ago, or some humorous translations from obscure magazines, change their appearance, copy them well, and send them to the newspaper office. Such manuscripts are naturally easy to publish, so they can wait quietly for the manuscript fee.

However, the editor who is in the position of a gardener, although he cherishes his own garden very much, it is difficult for him to meticulously identify the complicated seeds sent from various farms with his limited power and time. Therefore, it is not until the arrival of tourists that they will point out that this is an unworthy weed, and that is a flower that has mutated!

In the garden of Free Talk on the tenth of this month, a Mr. Huai Yizi also discovered during a visit that the article "Intelligence and Fool" published on August 1 under the name of "Ling Zhuoyan" was plagiarized from the article "Intelligent People and Fools" by Mr. Danxin on page 124 of the "Tide" series published on June 12, 1944. I think this person is very bold, but what is interesting is that the title of the exposed article happens to be "Intelligence and Fool". Is it that the God of Literature is playing tricks on the literary plagiarist in the dark, saying that he has turned from an intelligent person into a fool?

After reading the exposure of plagiarism published by the "Editorial Office," the plagiarist is miserable enough. Under such circumstances, it seems unkind to us to "not talk about their shortcomings" behind their backs, but considering this precious inch of land, in order to protect the growth of good crops and to take care of the gardener's energy, we, a group of visitors to the garden, have to grit our teeth, release our sharp eyes, and assist the editor to remove the tares that mix fish eyes with pearls, so that we can get a good harvest in the future!

Random Thoughts on Current Affairs

### Who Pays the Bill?

— Fan Zhengbang

Mayor Wu said that buying the racecourse in two years will "take the wool from the sheep," which seems to mean buying the racecourse with the money collected from the racecourse, which is a great deal. In fact, who is the sheep that produces the wool? Isn't it the Chinese people? Isn't the wool that foreigners allow to be given to the city government taken from the Chinese sheep? At the same time, foreigners have taken away even more wool. This statement is accurate only if it comes from foreigners. Mayor Wu's calculation has been beaten by foreign merchants. We, the onlookers, are clear. This is the key to Mayor Wu's political reputation. If I were Mayor Wu's brain trust, I would advise Mayor Wu to follow the resolution of the Senate, which is the best policy. If we add persuasion, it is the worst policy. If we can oppose it, it is the best policy. If we say that we will buy it in two years, who can guarantee it? At the end of last year, 5,000 yuan of legal tender could buy a dan of good white rice, but now we cannot buy a dou of good rice. It is better to gather investment now or jointly operate beneficial businesses with Chinese and foreign parties on this huge base. I think it is better to refuse them outright than to take their money after they have run away and then prohibit them from running away?

Two points: First, who pays the bill? Second, who can guarantee what will happen in two years? Dear Mayor, respect the opinions of the people! The people will support you!

### The Principal's Wishful Thinking

— Changpu

Yesterday, my friend Mr. Zhang came to visit. Because we are both in the education field, the topic was inseparable from our profession, and then we talked about the issue of teachers' advancement and retreat. He told me a scandalous thing that made me have to record it so that readers know that there is such a ridiculous thing in the world.

The thing is like this: On August 25, Mr. Zhang saw an advertisement in the newspaper that a certain elementary school in Pudong planned to hire several male and female teachers. He sent his resume. Two days later, he received a letter asking him to go to a certain elementary school on Daxi Road on the morning of the 29th for an interview and trial teaching. He thought that things must be slightly hopeful, but he did not know that when he went to the school that morning, it turned out to be a simple Weitang elementary school with only sixty or seventy students. The principal also served as the bell ringer, the school worker, the student who carried the organ, and the one who made boiled water, and also did chores. The principal was full of airs and showed an indifferent attitude, which made Mr. Zhang suspicious. Later, he was asked to teach several hours of classes that day, without water to drink, and he was exhausted and his mouth was dry before he was allowed to go back. He was told temporarily that whether he was hired or not, he would definitely receive a reply the next day, but Mr. Zhang waited five or six days after returning home, and there was no news at all. Knowing that he had been fooled, he had spent his own money and taught for him in the hot weather, "losing his wife and losing his army." It turned out that the shrewd principal was afraid that the students would not be able to stay if school started late, so he started classes early; but he did not want the old teachers to be paid from August, so he came up with this method. To put it nicely, it was asking new teachers to try out teaching, but in fact, it was saving himself the expense of salaries for August.

All of this is truly speechless.

### Liu Wendao, Head of the Fujian-Taiwan Investigative Team, Goes to Taiwan to Fight Tigers

— Jun Mo

Liu Wendao, head of the Fujian-Taiwan Takeover Work Investigative Team, arrived in Taiwan and hosted reporters on the 12th, saying, "We have come to Taiwan this time to fight tigers, not to swat flies."

People who have met Liu Wendao can believe that he can fight a few tigers: tall stature, strong build, square head and big ears, although he always seems to have a smiling face, he doesn't talk much, making it difficult to guess what he wants to do.

Military Background

This is a politician with a military background. Half of his life's work has been spent in his hometown of Hubei, and Liu Wendao has a particularly long relationship with Hankou; the other half has been spent abroad—Germany and Italy. After graduating from Baoding Military Academy, he, like many of his classmates, went to Japan, but he always seemed to have little interest in leading troops, so he soon went to France to study law at the University of Paris. When he returned to China, it was just as the Northern Expedition was unfolding; he, a young man in his thirties who had studied military affairs and then turned to the path of law, served as the director of the political department of the Forward Headquarters of the National Revolutionary Army. After the Northern Expeditionary Army occupied Hankou, he took office as the mayor of this city, which is the hub of north and south. At that time, Hankou, which had been occupied by warlords for a long time, was still in a mess, especially because Hankou had special zones and French and Japanese concessions, which made governance even more difficult. Taking transportation as an example, the rickshaws in Hankou could not be pulled into the special zones and concessions, and the rickshaws in the special zones and concessions could not be pulled out. This matter caused a lot of difficulties in transportation. After Liu's many negotiations with the concession authorities, the "military passage" between the two sides was finally successful. But unexpectedly, this small "international negotiation" was precisely the beginning of his long diplomatic career.

Once Envoy to Germany

In the 20th year of the Republic, Liu served as the minister to Germany; later, he was transferred to the minister to Italy. In the years before the war, the relationship between China and Italy was quite good, especially in aviation. There was a lot of cooperation in aircraft and flight training. At that time, most of the foreign instructors at the Central Aviation School at Jianqiao in Hangzhou were Italians. Liu made great contributions to the work in aviation cooperation. However, in the 26th year, when the August 13th Incident broke out, these ungrateful Italian instructors sat in Japanese bombers and bombed the Hangzhou fire station into an empty shell, which Liu could not have foreseen at the beginning!

Quite Humorous

Liu Wendao is quite humorous, but he is not willing to be lenient. When he was the mayor of Hankou, there was a very famous geomancer named Ding Shouyang who had been in Hankou for more than 20 years. He specialized in looking at the feng shui of tombs, and it was said that he was always accurate. A director in the city government admired him so much that he introduced him to the mayor's residence to find a good burial place for the ancestral tomb. This feng shui master boasted in front of Liu Wendao that after looking at this tomb, he would definitely be rich and prosperous for generations to come. Liu remained silent. After he finished speaking, after a long time, he slowly asked, "Since that's the case, why don't you find one for yourself first?" He drove the geomancer, who had been poured a bucket of cold water, out of the gate.

This was naturally just swatting a fly, but Liu is now going to see the feng shui of Taiwan for himself, and he will probably be able to pull a similar cold face and beat a few tigers back!
