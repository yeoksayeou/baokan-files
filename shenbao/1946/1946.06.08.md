### Marshall's Letter to Mao Zedong: Hope for Sincerity from Yan'an; Zhou Enlai and Others Return to Yan'an to Confer on the Overall Situation

[Our Nanjing Office, 7th Dispatch] After the announcement of the fifteen-day ceasefire communique was issued separately by the Chairman of the National Government and the representative of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), people in Nanjing, regarding the CCP's statement, specifically the two phrases, "and negotiations will inevitably involve political issues related to the Northeast and even the whole country, requiring more time," although not without a feeling of procrastination, but those who have a historical understanding of the CCP's consistent style, all believe this to be a political tactic of the CCP. Before going to Yan'an, Zhou Enlai, in order to prevent encountering obstacles in Yan'an, might as well drag a tail so as to shirk responsibility. However, the CCP headquarters in Yan'an, being the CCP's highest decision-making body, should not hold such a view or make such statements if it has a sincere intention for a ceasefire and peace, as this would be playing tricks and losing credibility in the world. Now Zhou Enlai and Lu Dingyi took a special plane by way of Marshall's plane at ten o'clock this morning directly to Yan'an to ask for instructions. Before his departure, Zhou had two meetings with Marshall yesterday to conduct decisive discussions on the Northeast issue and the restoration of transportation. It is said that Marshall had a handwritten letter entrusted to Zhou to be delivered to Mao Zedong. The content is unknown. Many believe that Marshall has placed his most sacred enthusiasm and last hope on Yan'an.

[Our Nanjing Office, 7th Dispatch] It is reported that Zhou Enlai and Lu Dingyi flew to Yan'an at about 5:00 PM today. The CCP headquarters has scheduled an important meeting for the 8th to hear Zhou and Lu's report on the ceasefire negotiations and discuss countermeasures. Based on past actions by the CCP headquarters, a major plan can be decided within a maximum of two days. It is said that Zhou and Lu told people before their departure that they would stay in Yan'an for three or four days, and at the latest, they can be expected to return to Nanjing before the 12th.

[Our Nanjing Office, 7th Dispatch] Premier Song Ziwen visited Marshal Marshall again on the morning of the 7th to discuss the new situation after the issuance of the ceasefire order. Shao Lizi, Secretary-General of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC), and Lei Zhen, Deputy Secretary-General, expressed to visiting reporters: They are sincerely optimistic. Lei also said: The Three-Person Committee will definitely convene within this half-month to discuss detailed measures for implementing the PCC resolutions.

[Our Nanjing Office, 7th Dispatch] The fifteen-day ceasefire order has taken effect today. The focus of general attention has shifted to the PCC small group and the Military Three-Person Committee, which symbolize peace negotiations, and when they will resume their meetings. According to reliable sources, the Military Three-Person Committee will reconvene as soon as Zhou Enlai returns to Nanjing from Yan'an. However, the previous government representative, Xu Yongchang, was originally a temporary appointment. This time, Chen Cheng will personally attend. As for the resumption of the PCC small group, it must wait until the Military Three-Person Committee reaches an initial agreement and resolves the major premise before it can continue to be held.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th Dispatch] PCC representatives Mo Dehui, Li Huang, Zeng Qi, Chen Qitian, Huang Yanpei, Luo Longji, Liang Shuming, and Shen Junru gathered at 3:00 PM on the 7th to exchange information and discuss military and political issues. No concrete conclusions were reached. They decided to continue discussions on the afternoon of the 8th.

[United Press, Nanjing, 7th Dispatch] PCC Secretary-General Lei Zhen said: During the fifteen-day ceasefire in the Northeast, it feels like too short a time to solve all kinds of problems that have accumulated over the years, but if both sides have sincerity, the overall situation can be determined within days. The Comprehensive Group will not continue to meet until the Military Three-Person Committee establishes a preliminary agreement. I am extremely optimistic about Chairman Chiang's ceasefire order in the Northeast. This time, the Communist Party will not withdraw from the negotiations. The Constitution Drafting Committee will also not hold formal meetings until military and political issues are resolved.

[Another Dispatch] Special Envoy Marshall hinted that Zhou Enlai may be carrying an outline of a national permanent cessation of conflict plan. This great plan must be approved by the CCP Politburo before Zhou Enlai, in his capacity as the CCP representative on the Military Three-Person Committee, signs an agreement.

[United Press, Shanghai, 6th Dispatch] Today, the Communist Party openly issued a warning, saying that General Marshall's efforts will ultimately be "ineffective" unless American troops immediately withdraw from China. The fifteen-day ceasefire between the KMT and the CCP is therefore shaken again.

The third group reviewed the budget, with a total of 43 cases, convened by Shen Honglie, Hu Shanheng, and Chen Qingyu. All members of the review committees attended. It is reported that the most meticulous and difficult case to review is the emergency measure for land tax and grain after the reform proposed by the Grain Department, because the case includes institutions, funding, personnel, and other items, and the case relates to the reform and innovation of finance and grain. If the review is easily passed, there may be excessive or insufficient shortcomings, and the most important thing in the case is the change in the mechanism. Regarding the proposals of the first group, a small number of personnel are still engaged in review tonight. The general meeting originally scheduled for tomorrow morning has been changed to the afternoon. The holiday on the 9th is suspended, and the general meeting will continue on the 10th.

The division of powers is handled according to the regulations of the Adjustment Plan issued by the Executive Yuan in February 34. (2) At the local level, the provincial, municipal, and county governments are the competent authorities. All business related to the collection, sorting out, and borrowing of grain from land tax will be assigned to the provincial, municipal, and county governments from the 35th year. (3) The various magisterial land tax grain management offices originally established by the central government will be changed to be subordinate to the provincial government, under the command and supervision of the provincial chairman, and under the command of the ministers of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Food, and will continue to perform their original duties. , County and city-level institutions and storage and transportation institutions at all levels will be transferred accordingly, but the opening period this year is pressing. In order to seize the opportunity and avoid hindering business, the organization, system, and personnel of all levels of institutions will temporarily remain unchanged. All affairs that have not originally established independent institutions in various provinces, cities, and counties shall also be concurrently handled by other agencies, and shall remain the same.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th Dispatch] The Conference on the Implementation of the Revised Financial Revenue and Expenditure System held group review sessions both in the morning and afternoon on the 7th. Except for the second group's taxation, which has been reviewed, the first group's land tax and grain, and the third group's budget have not yet been completed. It is scheduled to continue the meeting for review on the morning of the 8th. If the review can be completed at that time, the general meeting will be held in the afternoon. According to the conference schedule, the closing ceremony was originally scheduled for the afternoon of the 8th, but because there are too many proposals and the review time is extended, the date of the closing ceremony of the general meeting will be postponed. There are a total of 102 proposals, among which the most important are the "Emergency Measures on Land Tax and Food After the Implementation of the Revised Financial Revenue and Expenditure System" proposed by the Food Department and the "Regulations on the Collection, Allocation, and Delivery Procedures of National and Local Shared Taxes after the Revision of the Financial Revenue and Expenditure System" proposed by the Ministry of Finance, the "Actively Organize Local Taxes and Levies and Eliminate Harsh Taxes and Impose to Enrich Autonomous Financial Resources and Relieve People's Hardship" and the "Adjusted Financial Revenue and Expenditure Budget for the Second Half of the 35th Year for Provinces (Cities) and Counties (Cities)", and the review was also the most careful.

### Incident of Mad Massacre of Indigenous People in Dutch East Indies; Thousands of Overseas Chinese Die; East Indies Government Expresses Regret; Our Consul General Flies to Nanjing for Duty Report

[Central News Agency, Batavia, 6th special dispatch] According to a report from a returning British reconnaissance aircraft last night, fires were seen in the area one hundred square miles west of Tangerang. According to estimates by non-official Chinese and Dutch individuals, approximately three to four thousand overseas Chinese have been victimized. The investigation is still ongoing. The Deputy Governor of the Dutch East Indies, Mr. Mook, inspected Tangerang this morning.

[Central News Agency, Batavia, 7th United Press] As Indonesians retreated from areas around Tangerang, fifteen miles from Batavia, another hundred Chinese were killed.

[Reuters, Batavia, 6th dispatch] The Indonesian Republican Government issued a statement today formally expressing regret over the killing of overseas Chinese in the Tangerang area, twenty miles west of Batavia. It stated that since Indonesian security forces retreated from the Tangerang area and Dutch troops moved in, transportation between the government and the area west of Tangerang has been cut off. Incidents have occurred frequently around that area, creating a hostile environment between the Chinese and Indonesian residents. The government has now ordered an investigation, and once the results are obtained, it will take necessary measures. Chiang Chia-tung, the Chinese Consul General in Batavia, visited Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir yesterday and flew to Nanjing today. According to Xu Qinkai (transliteration), a leader of the overseas Chinese in Tangerang, no refugees have escaped from the west bank of the Tangerang River recently. Therefore, the situation of the 20,000 overseas Chinese west of Tangerang is very worrying. It is estimated that about 4,000 refugees have passed through the city of Tangerang, and about 600 overseas Chinese have been killed. (According to Agence France-Presse, the number of overseas Chinese casualties exceeds 3,000). An Allied headquarters spokesman said that aircraft detected burning villages in the northwest of Tangerang, covering an area of approximately 1.6 million square miles. The city of Tangerang was occupied by Dutch troops on May 28th, and part of the west bank was destroyed by fire. The city is still stable today.

Overseas Chinese women and children have become unfortunate victims of atrocities. It is reported that one thousand Chinese in a certain village were surrounded by invading rioters and were forced to desperately resist with knives and any other weapons they could obtain. Over three thousand overseas Chinese have fled to the Dutch military lines in Tangerang for temporary shelter. It is reported that Dutch troops recently occupied the Tangerang area, and it is believed that Indonesians suspect that the overseas Chinese cooperated with the Dutch military. According to local officials, this may be the cause of the current outbreak of violence.

Those that originally belonged to the French side will be returned separately. Our representatives will be designated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Finance. It is estimated that this work will take three months to complete. However, the French representatives have not yet been designated, so the actual work of the liquidation committee has not yet been able to start before the completion of our army's withdrawal.

Mr. Gillen first expressed his great pleasure in being able to return to China at the invitation of President Song. He will assist in solving China's famine to the best of his ability. Regarding the quantity of food allocated, China received the most, with a total of 45,000 tons of rice shipped to China. Malaya was second, with 40,000 tons. He also said that the British people are now also practicing food rationing to help the hungry, with rations even lower than during the war, with each person receiving only one ounce of butter, two ounces of vegetable oil, two ounces of cooking oil, three ounces of cheese, and two and a half mouthfuls of milk per week. Mr. Gillen went on to say that the problem of solving the famine is not only a matter of production but also a matter of transportation. The biggest difficulty China currently faces is this. Another important task for Mr. Gillen is to assist in solving the transportation problem, seeking transportation tools to the greatest extent possible within his scope of authority, eliminating transportation difficulties, and supplying tools for agricultural cultivation. Finally, Mr. Gillen hoped that the Chinese people would strive for production and conserve consumption. He is scheduled to leave here for Hong Kong tomorrow morning (9th) and then return to his country.

### Yunnan Merchants in Shanghai Order a Large Amount of Goods

[This newspaper, Kunming, 5th dispatch] The cloth, general merchandise, and cigarettes ordered by Yunnan merchants in Shanghai are said to have reached more than 200 million yuan in recent days.

### Ministry of Economic Affairs Establishes a Planning Committee to Discuss Plans to Promote Economic Construction

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th dispatch] In order to discuss economic plans and promote economic construction, the Ministry of Economic Affairs recently announced the establishment of its Planning Committee by ministerial order. The main tasks of this new organization are: 1. To discuss economic issues; 2. To review economic laws and regulations; 3. To plan economic undertakings. The committee will have 40 to 50 members, of which 30 to 40 will be appointed by the Minister from experts in the economic field, and 10 will be filled by senior officials from the ministry. The Minister and two Vice Ministers will serve as Chairman and Vice Chairman, respectively. All members are honorary positions, but they will be paid attendance fees and research fees when attending meetings and undertaking research on specific topics.

### Zhang Qun Flies from Chongqing to Chengdu

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 7th dispatch] Zhang Qun, director and acting chairman of the Chongqing Headquarters, met with reporters after returning to Chongqing from Nanjing and stated: He briefly stayed in Shanghai during this departure from Chongqing because he had a close relationship with Shanghai since the Xinhai Revolution. This was his first visit to Shanghai after the Anti-Japanese War. In addition to visiting relatives and friends, he had no other tasks. The personnel matters of the Headquarters have not yet been fully decided. The nature of the work of the Transportation and Economic Committees is still under discussion, so it does not seem necessary to determine personnel matters early. The task of the Headquarters is to supervise and promote the southwest's recommendation. He is ordered to take charge of it. In view of the great responsibility and to achieve the cause of southwestern construction, he will not leave Sichuan for the time being. When asked about the peace negotiations and their possible future, he said: He did not participate in the formal negotiations this time, but he knows that the government's consistent policy is to seek peace. The Double Tenth Agreement and the January 10th ceasefire agreement are ironclad evidence, but the acceptance of sovereignty in the Northeast is unrestricted. The implementation of the military reorganization plan and the restoration of transportation are necessary. The meaning of the Chairman's order to cease fire for fifteen days lies in this. It is hoped that concrete and effective methods can be negotiated and implemented during the ceasefire period. Concessions can be made politically, but the government must maintain the unity of governance.

[Another dispatch] Zhang Qun flew from Chongqing to Chengdu on a special plane at 1:00 PM on the 7th to attend the provincial council meeting to be held in Chengdu on the 10th.

### Wang Chonghui Arrives in Shanghai to Discuss Impressions of the International Situation

[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] Wang Chonghui, Secretary-General of the Supreme National Defense Council, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing on the morning of the 6th, making his first trip in nine years, and took the opportunity to check his health. Reporters paid a visit to his residence yesterday. In addition to his impressions of the current international situation, he also discussed the Northeast issue. Wang believes that, whether from a legal or moral point of view, our country has suffered the most from the long-term war of resistance, and the Northeast is our inherent territory. All industrial equipment, resources, and materials left by the enemy can be regarded as part of the enemy's compensation, and our country has the right to obtain them first. However, since our country fought alongside the Allied forces in this war, the disposal of "war booty" in the Northeast is not only a matter for our country alone. It is reported that Mr. Wang will stay in Shanghai for a few days before returning to Nanjing.

Editorial

### Appealing on Behalf of Millions of Elementary School Students!

The education authorities are now engaged in studying and revising the elementary school curriculum standards. Everyone doesn't seem to realize the importance of this matter, but it is enough to affect the happiness of every family. In the past, parents paid little attention to the education system and school curricula, and did not study them, allowing a few experts to impose regulations wholesale. As a result, looking back at the health of children in our families today, how is it? With even a slightly deeper observation, we can't help but feel disheartened.

The elementary school curriculum standards were announced in July of the 25th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1936] and revised and announced in October of the 31st year [i.e., 1942]. Today, the extremely heavy curriculum given to children in elementary schools across the country has naturally gone through the brains of many experts, but the result is the sacrifice of the health of most children and even the killing of many children's lives. A child of about ten years old has to study more than ten subjects, and there are all kinds of extracurricular activities. How can a fragile child's body support it? How can Chinese children, who are particularly thin and weak, digest it? In the elementary schools of Shanghai, things are even worse. In addition to the curriculum prescribed by the Ministry of Education, they also add English, or even English and French. Some even add things like "Confucian Classics." Some parents even praise and sing the praises of these schools, not knowing that these schools have in reality become prisons that trap children's bodies and minds.

If we had enough time today to compare our elementary school curriculum with the elementary school curricula of other countries, we would certainly rank first in terms of complexity and quantity! The physical condition of other countries' children is better than ours, their nutrition is better than ours, and their family environment is even better than ours, yet the amount of homework they receive is not more than ours. The weakness of most Chinese parents themselves means that our children already suffer a great loss in terms of congenital factors. After birth, the meager income of parents and the high prices make it very difficult for children to obtain standard nutrition. And after the children return home, most of the family environments are such that either the whole family is crowded into a small room, leaving the children no place to prepare their homework, or the children help with household chores after class, substituting for their parents' labor. How can Chinese children, in these unfavorable circumstances, read more books than others? However, the experts don't care, they don't care about the children's own abilities. They only care about adding more hours of teaching to their own specialized subjects, so that the children are forced to swallow homework that they cannot fully accept. As a result, children who are plump and fat at the age of five or six become thin and weak as soon as they enter schools where the curriculum is poorly managed. Not only is their development delayed, but they also become sallow and emaciated, and some even develop serious lung diseases in secret. If you don't believe it, parents, please examine the bodies and homework of your own children. Can these homework be shouldered by the children? If you ask a doctor to examine them, have many children already planted the seeds of some terrible diseases?

Forcing a child of five or six to about ten years old to get better grades than others is a very dangerous old idea. Because of this idea, I don't know how many children's bodies have been harmed. We have the right to demand that the experts not think that only their own specialized subjects are the most important and that the hours should be the most. You add more, I add more, making the curriculum standards an unreasonable "hodgepodge." We hope to merge the types of homework and reduce the amount. Especially in many elementary schools in Shanghai, the fifth and sixth grades have deeper English, which is not suitable for children's physical development and is even more unsuitable for the country's standpoint. Since the curriculum standards do not stipulate this, it should be strictly prohibited immediately. Today, the excessive burden of the elementary school curriculum is not only destroying the bodies of countless elementary school students invisibly, but also affecting their academic performance after entering middle school and university. For the sake of the entire education for the future of national construction, we can no longer remain silent.

Finally, we place our earnest hope on the "experts" who are studying and discussing the revision of the elementary school curriculum standards this time. Do not be "specialized" without being "versatile." Do not hesitate and look around on the old road. Save the innocent and naive elementary school students! They must be liberated from the shackles of the heavy curriculum!

Taicang: The Shanghai-Wuxi Long-Distance Bus Was Robbed

Since the resumption of the Shanghai-Wuxi long-distance bus service, business has been particularly good. On the morning of the 3rd, the first bus from Shaxi to Shanghai departed at 7:00 AM. In the wilderness of Maojia Guanyintang between Shuangfeng and the urban area, five bandits disguised as passengers drew guns and forced the bus to stop.

Bandit Ling Yufu, who was skilled in martial arts, served as the leader of the action group of the Loyal Salvation Army during the War of Resistance. He was involved in more than ten cases of kidnapping, extortion, murder, and arson in the areas of Bachai, Tongli, and Pingwang. Many of those who were torn up after being ransomed were also not a few. This time, the county government arrested him on the order of the province. Shen, the district chief of the Luxu District Office, arrested him and sent him to the county. After the secretary Huang Baoyun personally interrogated him, he directly admitted the crimes of kidnapping, arson, and murder. Because it was learned that the bandit was strong and brave, he had tried to escape several times during the journey to the county, but fortunately the guards were very strict and did not succeed. However, on the morning of the 4th, on the pretext of defecation, four soldiers accompanied him. Ling bandit jumped as usual with two pairs of heavy shackles on his feet. After going out, he suddenly seized the rifle held by the escorting soldier, fired two shots, hitting the military cap of the escorting soldier, and then fled forward. When the soldiers saw the important criminal escape, they fired shots to pursue him. The bullet hit a vital part and he died. Local people were relieved to hear the news.

The Central Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Anhui Provincial Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry, and the county government have successively dispatched locust control specialists to the various townships for inspection and personally supervised the local people to organize locust control teams to carry out the work of eliminating locust nymphs. It is learned that the Bengbu office of the Anhui Relief Branch transported 20 tons of imported flour from Bengbu by car on the morning of the 5th of this month, passing through Mingguang Station and loading it to Zhangbaling Township and other places for distribution to the locust control people as a reward.

Hangzhou: Telegram to Jiangxi to Release Zhejiang-Purchased Rice

Zhejiang Province is suffering from a severe rice shortage. The Provincial Land and Food Department is encouraging grain merchants to purchase from outside the province in order to regulate people's food supply. According to reports from grain stores such as Daxing, rice has been purchased in eastern Jiangxi, but the Shangrao County Government has prohibited its export and obstructed it in many ways. This matter is related to the supply of food to this province, and according to the central government's clear orders, there should be no obstruction. Therefore, the Jiangxi Provincial Land and Food Management Office is telegraphed to instruct the county to allow the rice to be released and to no longer cause difficulties so that materials from the two provinces can circulate and help each other.

Jiaxing: Chairman Shen Orders the County to Collect Military Grain

The collection of military grain in Jiaxing this time has caused a great uproar. Township chiefs have submitted their resignations and sent representatives to the province to petition. As a result, the amount was reduced by 5,000 piculs from 18,000 piculs, with the actual collection being 13,000 piculs. However, the townships still believe that there is no surplus grain to supply during this time of year when the harvest is not yet ripe. After several discussions, there is still no concrete solution. However, Provincial Chairman Shen Honglie telegraphed the county yesterday and the day before yesterday, instructing the county council and the county party department to give good advice and collect the full amount on schedule. After receiving the telegram, County Magistrate Hu believed that both military grain and people's food should be taken into account and allowed representatives of public opinion to state their actual difficulties.

### Burma Rises Up to Fight for Independence; Rangoon Residents Demonstrate, Demanding the Immediate Withdrawal of British Troops; Indian Princes Discuss Constitutional Plans

[Report from this Newspaper] San Francisco, 7th: Burma, following India, has now risen up to fight for independence, demanding the immediate withdrawal of British troops. A large-scale demonstration took place in Rangoon today, with tens of thousands of demonstrators chanting slogans such as "British Troops Get Out of Burma!" and "Long Live Burmese Independence!" The momentum was extremely great. In the British House of Commons, several Conservative Party members submitted a report on the Burmese issue today, stating that assassinations have been occurring daily in Burmese cities recently. So far, 240 people have been killed, and they strongly criticized the government for not taking any action.

Another report: Anti-British demonstrations occurred again in Egypt today. Someone threw a bomb into a movie theater, resulting in the deaths of dozens of British soldiers.

[Reuters, Mumbai, 7th] If the negotiations between the British Cabinet delegation and Indian leaders have a smooth outcome, approximately 600 Indian princes will disappear. The Standing Committee of the Council of Princes convened in Mumbai today to discuss the constitutional plan of the British delegation. If this plan is implemented, there will be major changes in the relationship between the Indian states and their internal institutions. In an independent India, only about ten of these ancient monarchs may continue to exist. Countless small countries, the smallest with an area of only a dozen square miles, will inevitably merge and disappear. The King of Hyderabad will undoubtedly continue to exist. He is known as the richest man in the world. The state's area is equal to the total area of England and Scotland, and its population is twice that of Australia. Its collection of pearls, diamonds, and other treasures is worth approximately 500 million pounds, while his personal expenses are only five pounds per month. He himself is a Muslim, but more than three-quarters of his 18 million people are Hindus. Other states, such as Kashmir, with 40 million people, and Mysore in the south, have hopes of being preserved. The total area of the Indian states accounts for one-third of the total area of India, and their population accounts for one-quarter. Among them, some have responsible governments, while others have a hereditary system of personal rule. The main issue at the Mumbai meeting is whether the princes will be forced to appoint the eighty representatives that each state is entitled to in the Constituent Assembly, or whether the opinions of the people of each state must be solicited. It is heard that Travancore and Cochin have expressed the principle of creating popular elections.

### Argentina and the Soviet Union Establish Diplomatic Relations; The Soviet Union Once Accused Argentina of Having Fascist Characteristics

[United Press, London, 7th] Moscow Radio broadcast that the governments of the Soviet Union and Argentina, based on the great principle that nations of the world should cooperate and understand each other, have established diplomatic relations. This is the first time the two countries have had diplomatic relations since the First World War. When the United Nations held a conference in San Francisco in 1945, the Soviet Union accused the Argentine government of having fascist characteristics. In 1940, Argentina also used the Soviet Union's invasion of Finland as an excuse to request the former League of Nations to expel the Soviet Union from the League, and was granted permission by the League of Nations. However, since Colonel Perón was elected President of Argentina, there was hope of restoring diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. In fact, Perón was also a key figure in the "fascist" regime last year.

[Also, report from the capital of Argentina] Argentine President Perón received reporters for the first time today and announced that Argentina has established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. (Soviet newspapers said that the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Argentina will generate extensive trade).

The Soviet Union demanded that the Security Council order all United Nations members to immediately sever relations with Franco's Spain. Britain and the United States vehemently argued that this move would not only fail to weaken Franco, but would instead strengthen his rule. Any further decisive action would be enough to cause a Spanish civil war.

[US Information Service, New York, 6th] The United Nations Security Council met today to discuss the Franco investigation report of the Council's subcommittee. No decision was made, and it was decided to discuss it again next Thursday. According to the subcommittee's recommendation, the Spanish issue should be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly, which will request members to sever relations with Spain (if the Franco regime continues to exist).

[US Information Service, New York, 6th] In a special radio broadcast on the second anniversary of the US military's landing in northern France, US Army Chief of Staff Marshal Eisenhower asked the American people to build peace with the same effort and sacrifice as they won the victory in the war. Eisenhower declared: "I will never tire of praising the American soldiers. But the struggle that American soldiers began and carried out has not yet been completed. Only when the world has achieved a solid and just peace can our efforts end. The victory won with bloodshed and sacrifice requires our efforts and sacrifice to ensure peace. The American people have taken this goal as their own responsibility, and they have authorized the armed forces through Congress to be responsible for implementing the enemy's surrender conditions. Only in this way can the foundation of peace be laid." He warned the American people: "If our efforts for peace falter, it will be our own fault. We must not fail. We have already gone through a terrible war. A little more effort and sacrifice can reduce the possibility of another war."

### The United States Invented a New War Tool: "New Flash Mirror"

[US Information Service, Washington, 6th] The US Navy has invented a red-infrared communication device for the fleet to transmit signals at night during combat. This equipment uses light waves that are invisible to the naked eye. The Navy Department pointed out that this red-infrared invention, called "New Flash Mirror," enabled the US Marines and soldiers on Okinawa Island to detect the actions of the Japanese army in the dark. The "New Flash Mirror" emits a red infrared beam, illuminating the target object and causing the image of the target object to be reflected in the concave forever mirror.

### The Italian Republican Government Will Be Established Next Week; President Elected on the 26th; It Is Rumored That Umberto Attempted Suicide; The Queen and Her Children Depart for Portugal by Ship

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 6th] The Italian Constituent Assembly has decided to elect a temporary president of the republic on the 24th of this month. It is uncertain whether any of the leaders of the three major parties are willing to take on this role. Prime Minister Gasperi has made it clear that he wishes to continue his political activities. Potential presidential candidates among prominent figures in the political arena include Orlando, Prime Minister during World War I; Bonomi, the first Prime Minister after the war; Sforza, the former Foreign Minister and renowned political writer; and Basia Dati, leader of the Republican Party.

A local radio station recently announced that the establishment of the Italian Republic will be postponed until next week. The reason for this is that the election office has received 36,000 reports that must be carefully studied.

King Umberto II advised Queen Marie-José to leave the country yesterday at midnight. This morning at 5:30 AM, the Queen and several of her children boarded the cruiser "Abruzzi" to go abroad. The ship was originally ordered to sail to Alexandria, but the route was later changed. Although King Farouk of Egypt invited Umberto II's family to Alexandria to live with the deposed King Ahmed Fouad II, Queen Marie-José had already received permission from the Portuguese government to take refuge in Lisbon and thus declined the Egyptian King's invitation. Umberto II will also go to Lisbon.

[Reuters, Rome, 6th] Italian Prime Minister Gasperi told reporters yesterday that Umberto will hand over power and abdicate after the Supreme Court officially announces the election results on Saturday.

[Reuters, Paris, 6th] According to this evening's newspapers, King Umberto of Italy attempted suicide after the people voted against the monarchy. However, this news has not been confirmed by any party.

### Japanese Emperor's Tour: Poor People Cheer, Women Weep; Returned to the Palace by Car Yesterday Afternoon

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 7th] Emperor Hirohito of Japan arrived in Chiba Prefecture today. As he walked through a rubble-strewn area of about 300 yards, thousands of impoverished people affected by the war cheered enthusiastically. Military police carrying rifles closely followed the attendants. The Emperor had no other guards. Several women cried aloud. Hirohito stopped twice to comfort disabled veterans wearing Red Cross insignia. This was the last day of the Emperor's second tour to encourage people to engage in reconstruction work. When he stepped up the mountain to hear responsible officials report on the city's reconstruction work, his attitude seemed calmer than in previous visits. Before returning to the palace, the Emperor personally comforted 400 repatriated Japanese and their families about their living conditions. They are engaged in cultivating a farm that was previously a cavalry training ground, where the Emperor inspected troops every year before the war. At noon, Hirohito returned to the palace in a large black car. The trip covered more than 200 miles, and he met with 200,000 to 300,000 people.

### Reform of the Japanese Police System: American Expert Proposes Three Recommendations

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 6th] American police expert Valentine, dispatched by MacArthur, has been investigating the police system in various parts of Japan for two months. He has now publicly released a report, putting forward three recommendations as follows:

(1) The police should be subject to the administrative jurisdiction of each city, and the administration of each city should be directly responsible to the voters. (2) The recruitment and treatment of police must be improved. (3) Police powers should be limited to police affairs. Matters within judicial authority should not be overstepped. For example, inspecting news and interfering in private life or private affairs were common in the past but must be stopped in the future. In short, the police are the servants of the nation, not the masters of the nation.

### Three Major Japanese Shipping Companies Placed on Blacklist

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 6th] MacArthur Headquarters recently issued a bulletin stating that the Allied Headquarters has officially placed the three major Japanese shipping companies, namely Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK), Osaka Shosen Kaisha (OSK), and Yamashita Kisen, as well as their affiliated companies, on the blacklist. Before and during the war, these three major companies were the backbone of the Japanese merchant fleet. Without these companies, Japan would not have been able to participate in international trade and become one of the powerful nations before the war. Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK) holds 480 million yen, Osaka Shosen Kaisha (OSK) holds 581 million yen, and Yamashita Kisen holds 186 million yen. There are 84 small companies affiliated with these companies.

### Who Actually Received Subsidies? British Home Secretary Says Fascist Leader Received Mussolini Subsidies; Mosley Says "Daily Herald" Received Soviet Subsidies

[Reuters, London, 6th] British Home Secretary Ede announced in the House of Commons today that Sir Oswald Mosley, leader of the British fascist organization "British Union," had received subsidies from Mussolini. A letter from the former Italian ambassador to Britain, Grandi, to Mussolini was found in Mussolini's documents. Mosley issued a statement in response, saying: "According to Lord Snowden's biography, the British government issued a communiqué stating that the Soviet representative in Britain, Kamenev, told the Soviet government that diamonds worth 40,000 pounds had been sold and the money had been handed over to the Daily Herald." The industrial organization "Daily Herald" categorically denied the fascist leader Mosley's claim that the "Daily Herald" had accepted a 40,000-pound subsidy from the Soviet Union 25 years ago. It made the following footnote to Mosley's statement: On September 19, 1921, the Communist International gave 60,000 pounds to Maynard, then one of the directors of this newspaper, to solve the financial difficulties. After being discovered by other directors, they unanimously opposed it. Maynard was therefore removed from office, and the money was returned to the original owner.

### Captured After the Fall of Hong Kong; Former Director of the "Commercial Control": Lin Kanghou Denies Collaborating With the Enemy, Cries Injustice, Transfers Part of the United Chemical Factory

— Messenger Witness Wang Zhisan

[Our Newspaper] The suspected treason case of Lin Kanghou, one of the "Three Old Men" of Shanghai, was first heard in the Special Criminal Court of the High Court in Tilanqiao at 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon. Lin was wearing a dark blue jacket, flannel trousers, a light blue striped shirt, a purple-red and black tie, modern glass, green sunglasses, and a bamboo folding fan, giving him a Western gentleman's demeanor. Lin Kanghou in the defendant's column (Photograph by Chuang)

Lin is a Shanghainese, 70 years old, who has been in the education and finance industries. He once served as the Deputy Minister of Finance. After the fall of Hong Kong, he was arrested along with Li Sihao and others and detained in Hong Kong. He was then escorted back to Shanghai by enemy aircraft until March of the 32nd year. When the puppet government established the "Commercial Control Council" in Shanghai, Lin served as the director and secretary-general of the council. In June of the 33rd year, he served as a member of the Puppet Shanghai Municipal Advisory Committee, handling relief work in Shanghai, and transferred the original alcohol manufacturing machines of the United Chemical Factory, which he co-founded with Wang Zhisan and others, to the Japanese side for 1 million yuan. However, according to Lin, the prosecutor's so-called "defection and collaboration with the enemy" is a complete injustice. Because during his stay in Shanghai, he refused all threats and inducements from the enemy puppets, he was wanted by the puppet government. Among the 83 people on the blacklist published by the puppet government, the first name was Jiang Bocheng, and the third was himself. Therefore, he had no choice but to flee to Hong Kong. When the Pacific War broke out in the 30th year, he was captured after the fall of Hong Kong and detained for 104 days, but he still did not yield. On April 15th of the 31st year, he was escorted back to Shanghai by the Japanese side. Until June, he was still not satisfied with the Japanese puppets and was arrested by the enemy police. In March of the 32nd year, when the puppet Commercial Control Council was established, more than 20 directors and supervisors were appointed, and none of them were forced to serve. Therefore, the defendant did not defect to the enemy but was invited to serve by the puppet government on the grounds that it was "beneficial to industry and commerce." In fact, from May of the 32nd year to June of the 33rd year, during Tang Shoumin's term as "Director Wei," it was the period of implementing material control and distribution. At this time, he was only a nominal director. By July of the 33rd year, after Wen Lanting headed the Commercial Control Council, he invited Lin to be the secretary-general four times, saying that he wanted to reduce the scope of the "Commercial Control" and lay off redundant staff to do his best to preserve the work. By the end of August 10th of last year, more than 10,000 pieces of cotton yarn were still stored. Wen Lanting telegraphed Chairman Jiang specifically to ask for instructions on how to deal with it, and received a reply ordering them to keep it properly. In the end, the Ministry of Economy sent personnel to take over the entire quantity. Therefore, not only did he not carry out the collection and distribution of materials, but he also preserved materials for the country. At this time, the defendant's defense lawyer, Jiang Yiping, presented two pieces of evidence: (1) A handwritten letter from Wen Lanting, proving that the defendant only did administrative work during his tenure as secretary-general of the "Commercial Control Council." (2) The blacklist in the wanted order issued by the Wang puppet regime.

Lin also claimed that during the Anti-Japanese War, the defendant suffered deeply, and his patriotic heart arose spontaneously. Therefore, the defendant was the first to run to Chongqing at the end of the 26th year of the Republic. After serving as secretary-general in July of the 33rd year, he laid off all the Japanese staff in the "Commercial Control Council." In June of the 33rd year, he served as a member of the Shanghai Municipal Government Advisory Committee due to the invitation of the puppet mayor Chen Gongbo, which he could not refuse. The work was only to attend a meeting once a month, where the municipal government reported on the work of the past month. The defendant used to engage in charitable activities, so he also took on relief work. As for the United Chemical Factory, after the defendant came to Shanghai in the 31st year, he served as a director and did his best to help United resist the Japanese side's seizure of its alcohol manufacturing machines until the end of the 32nd year. Later, the factory's machines were leased to the American Chemical Factory, and a Japanese man, Uetani, was hired as a consultant to cover up. As a result, because the Japanese side needed alcohol, it forcibly purchased it for 1 million yuan. This matter has nothing to do with the defendant. Moreover, the defendant's investment in the factory was only 67,500 out of 3.15 million puppet currency, so he was a small shareholder, which is inconsistent with what is stated in the indictment. The court summoned witness Wang Zhisan, a native of Zhenhai, 48 years old, who was a shareholder of United Chemical Factory. After inquiring about the capital and machines of the factory, the hearing was adjourned for another day. Lin's family members attended the hearing yesterday, but Lin did not request to see them.

### Zhou Bangjun Is Much Fatter, Presents Many Counter-Evidence

Zhou Bangjun, a native of Changshu, Jiangsu, 58 years old, lives at 12 Zhonghua Xincun, Xinlan Road. He graduated from an American church school in 1909 and has served as the director of the Central Military Hospital, the director of the Military Medical Office, the chief medical officer of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau, the manager of Zhongxi Pharmacy, and the general manager of the Star Perfume Factory. Since the 29th year of the Republic, he participated in puppet organizations, serving as a member of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association, a member of the Anti-British and American Association, and the deputy director of the Municipal Baojia Preparatory Office. He also provided the trucks of Zhongxi Pharmacy for the use of the enemy army. The case was tried by Judge Cao Jun in the Criminal Court No. 1 at around 10:00 yesterday morning. When the defendant entered the court, he was wearing a blue cloth long gown and black leather shoes, and his voice was slightly hoarse. According to his statement, the puppet Sino-Japanese Cultural Association had 200 to 300 members, all of whom were forced to join from all walks of life. He only attended once because "businessmen have little interest in culture," so he did nothing at all, and only learned from the newspapers that the association had held a calligraphy and painting exhibition. As for being a member of the "Anti-British and American Association," he claimed that he was also forced to be invited. The "General Secretary" Chen Ya'fu invited them to a dinner at the International Hotel, and the association was established on the spot. He did not want to join, but Chen Ya'fu threatened him with the Japanese Secretary Sakata, so he joined, but he did not participate in the "People's Congress" in the racecourse. Zhou供: Bangjun participated in the revolution in the first year of the Republic and has always been a backbone of the Anti-Japanese War. How could he be so mad as to be against Britain and the United States. As for the Shanghai Municipal Baojia Preparatory Committee, he claimed that six bombing incidents occurred in the eastern district of the Public Concession at the end of the lunar year of the 31st year of the Republic, which led to a large blockade by the Japanese army. Residents within the area around Xizang Road, Avenue Edward VII, Beijing Road, and the Bund were not allowed to enter or leave, and some even starved to death. The situation was extremely dangerous, so a "Baojia Committee" was formed in the name of representatives from industry and commerce to negotiate with the Japanese side to lift the blockade, which was beneficial to the people. The actual organization of the Baojia was handled by the puppet police bureau, and he did nothing. Later, the judge asked Zhou about his relationship with Chu Minyi. He claimed: "His sister's Miss is Bangjun's daughter-in-law, but they don't have much contact." As for why Wang Yongkang knew Chu Minyi, it was not through his introduction, but because Chu Minyi built the Tang Monk Pagoda in Nanjing in the 33rd year, Wang Yongkang donated money, so he knew him. The court decided to summon Wang Yongkang next time to confront him in court. As for Zhou's use of Zhongxi Pharmacy's trucks for the factory, he said it was robbery and not voluntary. Finally, Zhou presented several pieces of evidence in his favor: (1) He used 3 million yuan to help the radio station of the Military Affairs Department in Shanghai. (2) He helped the families of anti-Japanese martyrs, and Ms. Lu Huimin, the wife of Du Gang, testified in court. (3) He donated 1,000 sets of military uniforms to the Military Affairs Commission. (4) He helped British man Fercuson. (5) He assisted Tongde Medical College. (6) He rescued Bi Gaokui. The court ordered the summons of witnesses and another hearing. After the adjournment, Zhou Bangjun met with his family. His daughter and nephews all said, "We haven't seen you in September, you've gotten much fatter." Zhou replied with a smile, "It doesn't matter, this is just a storm."

### Gathering Famous Actors and Opera Enthusiasts in One Hall: Charity Performance to Benefit the Northeast for Two Nights, Program Preview

After the restoration of the Northeast, Madame Chiang Kai-shek initiated the Northeast Relief Association in Chongqing. The fundraising matters in Shanghai were entrusted to Du Yuesheng as the team leader, and Qian Xinzhi, Xu Jiqing, Wang Xiaolai, and others as the deputy team leaders. In addition to the 100 million yuan that Team Leader Du had already raised and remitted in advance, it was also decided that from June 11th, famous actors and opera enthusiasts would be invited to perform a charity performance at the Tianchan Stage for three days, and the proceeds would be used for relief expenses.

Opera fans have been rushing to buy tickets and reserve seats.

### Curfew to Be Lifted

[Our Newspaper] Since the implementation of the curfew in this city, it has been quite effective in terms of public security; however, the public feels greatly inconvenienced, and the impact on general night market operators has been particularly significant. Now that daylight saving time has been advanced by one hour, and the summer heat is steaming, staying indoors feels hot and stuffy. According to reliable sources, the authorities have discussed this matter and intend to lift the curfew soon, which should be seen in fact soon.

### Poverty, Ignorance, and Abandoned Homes: The Causes of Rampant Cholera - A Crisis Looms in Lujiazhaing

"After a great war, there will inevitably be a great epidemic!" It seems this saying will come true in Shanghai this year. Ask any elder in Shanghai; when have they ever seen cholera begin to spread before the Dragon Boat Festival? Despite the meteorological observatory's report that this summer will not be too hot, the reality proves otherwise: these past few days have been as hot as midsummer. Coupled with a severe drought, it is the perfect breeding ground for rampant cholera! Abandoned homes, poverty, and ignorance further exacerbate the opportunities for cholera to flourish. Shanghai is not lacking in high-rise buildings, but the war has brought poverty! In Zhabei and Nanshi, countless families are living hellish lives!

I want to cite a specific example. Near the Lujiazhaing vegetable market in Nanshi, there is a large mound of earth. The origin of this mound is easy to surmise: the base of the mound contains orderly foundations, which were, of course, once proper houses before the war. After the Japanese troops entered, a great fire erupted in Nanshi, and these houses became piles of rubble. The nearby residents have been dumping basket after basket of garbage onto this rubble every day, truly building a tower of sand. Now, garbage, excrement, and the original rubble have accumulated to a height of seven or eight feet.

As a result, those impoverished people who cannot afford to live in high-rise buildings have built ten or so shacks along the base of the mound. These shacks must be built close to the mound because the mound itself serves as a wall, saving them the cost of several reed mats. They simply erect a bamboo frame, cover it with reed mats, and top it with some grass, considering themselves to be "living in a hut amidst human dwellings." These shacks are not independent; they are simply small spaces partitioned by reed mats, each space housing a family. The largest family has a horizontal space of eleven feet and a depth of probably less than ten feet, with no windows and no drainage ditches.

And most of these shack dwellers are selling food! They make flatbreads, fried dough sticks, and wontons at their doorways. One family even sells rice. Flies buzz around, and phlegm is spat everywhere. Yet, they seem to be thriving daily!

Across the mound, facing these shacks from afar, is a very tall and large building. On its snow-white walls, large characters, seven or eight feet square, are written: "Nanshi Funeral Home."

Sixteen or seventeen steps south of the mound is the Lujiazhaing vegetable market, which is crowded with customers every day. Every morning, more vegetable scraps and fruit peels are dumped onto the mound; every morning, many housewives buy flatbreads and fried dough sticks from the stalls in these shacks to take home for breakfast.

If cholera spreads to such places, what will happen? It must be understood that this is not the only shantytown in Shanghai!

If we drive them out, where will they go? Nanshi is currently undergoing a major construction boom, but these new houses are only slightly taller than the shacks, with reed mats on the roofs replaced by tiles and a layer of yellow mud plastered on the walls. In the event of a fire, the consequences would be unthinkable, and if cholera were to break out, there would be absolutely no possibility of quarantine!

Most people are unwilling to get vaccinated against cholera, saying, "The Japanese are gone, so why get a shot!" I think this is a time when mandatory injections are necessary! (Pingzhai)

### "King of Metals" Zhang Lianfang - Once Presented Steel to the Enemy Army

Zhang Lianfang, known as the "King of Metals," is from Ningbo, 47 years old, and resides at 116 Siming Village, Foch Road. He established Hengda Xiang Hardware Store in Shanghai. From 1936, he served as the chairman of the Hardware Trade Association. At the end of 1941, under the control of the puppet regime, the so-called United Office of Hardware and Steel was established in Shanghai's hardware industry, and Zhang became the director of the Hardware Group of the office. He collected more than 1,200 tons of steel and hardware from the industry and presented it to the enemy's naval department, and 700 to 800 tons to the army department. Later, during his tenure as the chief of the sixth pao of the second joint bao of the puppet Huangpu District and as the chairman of the Shanghai Special City Hardware Trade Association, he also promoted the donation of iron, which benefited the enemy. During interrogation yesterday, Zhang stubbornly argued: The donation of iron was a matter for all bao chiefs, he was forced to do it, and he never attended any bao chief meetings.

Li Haoju and others

In addition, several other people were interrogated on the same day, including Li Haoju, a native of Guangdong, director of the Shanghai office of the puppet Postal Administration. According to his confession, he was the consul general in Manila before the war, and his nephew was the son-in-law of the traitor Wang Jingwei. He originally did business, but was "persuaded" by the traitor Chen Junhui to join the puppet postal bureau. Also, enemy intelligence agent Ma Le, Zhou Ding, chief of the puppet secret service radio machinery section, Qian Jieyi, councilor of the puppet Jiangsu Provincial Government, and others were also interrogated and scheduled for further questioning.

Also, the case of Li Ze, general manager of the New New Company, was announced today.

Qiu Junlian Released on Bail After Sentencing

Also, the case of Qiu Junlian, suspected of being a traitor, has been concluded after trial. Yesterday, the verdict was announced: Qiu Junlian was sentenced to two and a half years of imprisonment for colluding with enemy countries and plotting to resist his own country, deprived of civil rights for two years, and all property confiscated except for the necessary living expenses for his family. However, Qiu was granted bail due to the relatively minor nature of his crimes. It is said that this is an unprecedented move since the High Court began trying traitors.

### The Problem of Repatriating German Nationals: Criteria for Staying or Leaving Should be Established

The price of rice in this city skyrocketed rapidly after April 15th, once reaching a peak of 63,000 per shi. The central government dispatched a special envoy to Shanghai to investigate thoroughly, and promptly arrested four "rice weevils" suspected of hoarding and profiteering: Wu Rongsheng, manager of San Tai Rice Store; Wang Xunzhi, deputy manager of Changjiang Enterprise Company; Wang Meile, accountant; and Zhuang Hanzhang, business director. After more than ten days of investigation, evidence was obtained confirming that these rice weevils used grain loans to speculate and hoard. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday at 5 p.m., they were transferred to the Military Law Department of the Garrison Headquarters for strict punishment in accordance with the temporary regulations on food management during the illegal emergency period. According to reporters, the crimes of these four rice weevils in endangering people's food supply and the process of their use of grain loans are as follows: (1) After obtaining a grain loan of 60 million yuan on April 15, Changjiang Enterprise Company purchased 1,848 shi and 5 dou of rice in the Songjiang area and transported it to Shanghai, hoarding it in warehouses for a month before selling part of it at a high price. In addition, it was found that a total of 2,017 bags and 150 shi of rice were secretly stored in various warehouses without being registered in accordance with the regulations, and all of them have now been sealed by our military authorities. (2) Wu Rongsheng, manager of San Tai Rice Store, was entrusted by the Grain Administration Office in early May to sell 11,000 bags of rice to stabilize the rice price. However, Wu delayed for several days, and the rice price soared. From May 11th to 22nd, he sold 4,530 bags in 13 days, but only half of them were sold to retail rice stores in accordance with the law, causing the rice price to continue to soar in a straight line. Wu made huge illegal profits from this, and the proceeds from the sales were not immediately remitted to the Grain Department, but were deposited in the Central Trust Bureau for turnover and use. The remaining unsold rice was hoarded in warehouses under the name of "San Tai" to seek profiteering. It is reported that the Military Law Department opened an investigation court yesterday morning to interrogate the four rice weevils, Wu Rongsheng, and will announce the full picture of the case within a few days. In addition, the Grain Loan Audit Committee entrusted the Daming Accounting Firm to audit the accounts of 16 grain loan merchants, and notified the 16 grain loan merchants to submit all relevant accounts for audit immediately.

The city authorities are handling the repatriation of German nationals. It is reported that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has notified each German national to prepare accordingly, and the municipal government will carry out the concentration and transportation in batches back to their country. The first batch will consist of nearly 1,000 people. These Germans are not all government officials and Nazi party members; even those who have never asked about politics and only engaged in business are included in the repatriation list. The government's measures for dealing with German nationals originally had provisions for allowing technicians and other well-behaved individuals to apply for residence in China. Many of them have gone through registration, guarantee, application, and other procedures, but now that they are all being repatriated uniformly, the previous procedures are equivalent to being invalid, and many Germans are suffering from not knowing what to do. Moreover, there are a few who have applied for naturalization, and even those who have been doing business in China for three generations or who were born in China already consider Shanghai as their second hometown. If their businesses are all destroyed and they leave empty-handed, they cannot help but feel sadness. It is reported that several well-known figures in this city who are familiar with the situation of German nationals believe that during the Anti-Japanese War, when resources were transferred inland, some relied on Germans to come forward to cover them up, and even some central government officials and underground workers were rescued from danger by Germans. Now that they are all being repatriated uniformly, it seems to lack fair criteria and loses the grace of a great power. The government should, from the standpoint of a great nation, stipulate criteria for German nationals to stay or leave, and carefully distinguish them one by one. Those who should be repatriated should be repatriated, those who should be allowed to reside should be allowed to reside, and those who should be allowed to naturalize should be allowed to naturalize. And those who should be naturalized should also set another procedure for finding a guarantor to prevent malpractice. If it can be handled in this way, then Germans can be convinced from the heart.

### Strengthening Traffic in This City - Public Buses to Add Routes and Vehicles

[This newspaper's report] Traffic chaos and difficulty walking in the city center. The reporter yesterday made a special visit to the Municipal Public Works Bureau. According to Deputy Director Zhang Rentao, the Public Works Bureau, in view of the insufficient number of existing vehicles, had purchased vehicles from the "Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration," but because the vehicles were not suitable for current needs, it has now changed to purchasing 45 trucks from the Shanghai Materials Supply Bureau. After modification, they will be used as public buses. It is expected that more than a dozen vehicles can be assembled by the end of this month and can be put into use immediately. The routes have not yet been finalized. However, this type of vehicle is only a temporary remedy, and will be sent to the suburbs for secondary use after the traffic is restored in the future.

Deputy Director Zhang continued: The Shanghai Municipal Public Works Bureau Public Bus Preparatory Committee will be established no later than next month.

At that time, the existing routes of British and French businesses will be leased for use.

### Increased Supply Brings Calm; Rice Market Peaceful; Stable Passage Through the Lean Season Expected

[Our Correspondent] The food problem has eased since the authorities began strict investigations. Holders of goods are releasing their stocks, and sources of supply are continuously increasing. Market prices are falling, in stark contrast to the surge last month. However, the general public still hopes that the authorities will severely punish those rice merchants who caused trouble in the past, as a warning to others. It is now learned that the 1,000 tons of imported rice remaining in Shanghai were officially unloaded yesterday morning (the 7th) and temporarily stored in the Ministry of Food's warehouse. Distribution will be handled after the Ministry of Food issues instructions. The remaining 2,200 tons will be shipped to Huludao within days to aid the people of North China. Previous reports of shipment to Beijing were inaccurate. Furthermore, the imported rice ordered by the Ministry of Food has begun to arrive in batches and will continue to arrive in Shanghai. According to Mayor Wu, he is very confident in the food supply in Shanghai and believes that the city can safely pass through this three-month lean season. Rice merchants who violate food control regulations and non-rice merchants engaged in the rice trade will be severely punished.

Additionally, Jiang Han, the manager of the China National Grain Industry Corporation, is still in Shanghai overseeing the purchase of imported rice. The company, currently based in Chongqing, will soon establish a new agency in Shanghai to be responsible for purchasing imported rice and other related business. It is also planning to send key personnel to the United States and then to South America for investigation. It is understood that the locations under consideration for ordering grain include Brazil, Chile, Argentina, and Ecuador. It is said that all import duties on imported rice can be completely waived.

### Japonica and Indica Rice Continue to Fall by Small Amounts of 3,000 to 5,000 Yuan

### Short Selling in Public Bonds

Public bonds were slightly volatile yesterday as the pressure from short sellers increased. The longs also wanted to gain an advantage. The "Tong Bing" bonds opened in the morning with makers deliberately driving up the price, shouting as high as 6,500 yuan, making it very difficult to sell. Soon, the price gradually declined, and the supply surged. Due to the pressure from short sellers, the price gradually fell to 5,700 yuan before stabilizing. At noon, the result was around 5,850 yuan, down 400 yuan from the previous close. After the close, the price was shouted up again to over 6,000 yuan.

### Slight Decline in Gold Prices

Gold yesterday was still influenced by the strength of the US dollar. Although the announcement of the ceasefire led some longs to liquidate their positions, the price fell gradually from 1.835 million to 1.815 million in the morning. However, some locals still held a positive view on gold and foreign exchange despite the peace news and absorbed gold when prices were low. The market soon stabilized slightly, hovering around 1.83 million after 10:00 AM. The Central Bank allocated 136 bars of gold to the industry at a price of 1.83 million. Subsequently, the US dollar performed increasingly well, indirectly boosting the gold market. Before noon, the price had rebounded to over 1.86 million, but it was around 1.855 million at noon. The market softened slightly in the afternoon, and the price was forced to fall slightly under the pressure of the Central Bank's sales. The final result was a decline of 20,000 from the previous close. Jewelry gold was 190,000, silver was 2,200, silver dollars were slightly stable, and the interbank lending market was even tighter, with interest rates around 13%.

### US Dollar Settlement Busy After Foreign Exchange Feels Restraint

Foreign currencies, especially US dollars, were extremely popular, and there was a rush to settle transactions for reserve purposes. The market opened around 2,370 yuan in the morning. After opening, the price briefly declined to below 2,350 yuan due to the downturn in the gold market. As the situation stabilized slightly, a surge of settlement transactions pushed the price up to 2,490 yuan before leveling off slightly. In the afternoon, the price fell slightly due to some foreign merchants offering sales, resulting in an increase of 50 yuan from the previous close. The Hong Kong exchange rate was slightly flat at 430 yuan, as was the rupee at 525, with some sales. The US exchange rate was nominally flat but actually tight, and transactions were not easy.

Stable Cloth Market

Demand for winter goods from buyers in the cloth market remained strong, so the market could maintain stability. The supply of grey fabrics did not loosen significantly, but dyeing factories collected a considerable amount in recent days. However, procurement under the root rate system is not as active as before, and the supply from the China Textile Corporation has increased slightly. Nevertheless, popular goods are still not readily available, so the trend is peaceful, with mixed ups and downs in the market.

### Mixed Fortunes in Yarn Market; Current Cotton Trading Very Good

In yesterday's yarn market, 20-count "Luma" yarn initially rose by 20,000, with 1.26 million units traded. However, as the factory intended to offer sales, the price fell again. Sellers of 20-count small-scale yarn were eager to sell, leading to a decline of about 10,000. At noon, Fangjian opened yarn for sale as usual. The 20-count popular yarn in the market had three brands available: Yunpeng, Yanghe, and Lanfeng. Dealers were less enthusiastic, and fewer purchase orders were placed than in the past.

### Excessive Surge; Longs Liquidate; China Shares Begin to Fall Yesterday; Foreign Shares Turn from Stable to Weak

Yesterday, China shares were extremely active, reaching a boiling point. A certain bank vigorously purchased unpopular small shares, such as Xinya, Zhongfa, and Neiyi Shijie, and dealers deliberately hyped them up, causing the price of Zhongfa Neiyi to approach 300 yuan and the price of Xinya Pharmaceutical to jump by about 30% to 150 yuan compared to the previous day. However, due to the excessive surge, they were soon knocked down by longs in the industry, and the decline was rapid. As a result, popular shares lacked support and also declined. The market was weakest near noon. Compared to the previous Saturday, the yarn market was slightly down. Meiya Jingfu fell by half a percent, while Xinguang Qinxing fell but not by much. Among the unpopular shares, Zhongxing, Xinyong, and Rongfeng retreated, while Guan Cheng, Zhongfang, and Dachina fell slightly. Yuanlao shares remained stable.

Foreign shares were initially stable but then weakened. The longs had no intention of holding for long. Yisha opened in the morning, hovering around 12,800 yuan, but gradually weakened after opening. Yinglian and others also followed suit, with most at low prices near halftime. Compared to the previous close, Yisha, Yinglian, and Zhiyue fell by about 10%, while others fell but not by much.

### Continued Weakness in Coal Prices

Hongji layer allocation price reduction; coke and cooked coal also fell

Transactions in the coal market were scarce, and market sentiment was weak, with a consistent bearish outlook. Only bituminous coal showed some activity. The highest price of coke and cooked coal had reached 500,000 to 600,000 yuan before, but due to the abundance of arrivals and sluggish actual sales, the price quickly fell back to 200,000 yuan and remained stable for quite some time. Now, it is also affected by the decline in white coal and is falling towards the 200,000 yuan mark. Furthermore, the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has approved the application from the coal ball manufacturing industry to reduce the allocation price of Hongji layer, the raw material for making coal balls. The price is lower than before, at 110,000 yuan per 10,000, delivered at the Pudong wharf coal depot.

### MacArthur Orders Japanese Government to Deliver Lumber to China Monthly

The import and export section of the Economic and Scientific Department claimed that 25,000 "stones" of lumber will be shipped to Qinhuangdao and 10,000 "stones" to Shanghai each month. The Japanese "stone" is equivalent to about 10 cubic feet.

### Global Wheat Production and Sales Situation; Demand Reaches 78.4 Million Bushels; Supply Only 48.3 Million

[Reuters, New York, 7th] Regarding the shipment of wheat to protected areas, the government recently took two measures: First, the government will issue a uniform 25% allowance for wheat transported to granaries. Second, the limit price of Chicago wheat will be raised by 15 cents per bushel, plus the government will give a special bonus of 30 cents for wheat exported before May 25, for a total increase of 45 cents. The extent to which this measure will be implemented is not yet known.

Wheat occupies an important position in the world food relief plan. In 1945, half of the calories in the food of European countries were supplied by wheat, while the number for the United States was only a quarter. This shows the importance of wheat, and the shipment and export of grains are easier than those of meat and dairy products. The quantity needed to be imported by various regions in the first half of 1946 is estimated at approximately 73.2 million bushels, and with substitutes of rice, it requires a total of 21 million tons, for a total of 78.4 million bushels.

The wheat exported from surplus-producing countries is approximately 47 million bushels, and according to an estimate made by the US Agricultural Economics Bureau at the end of March, these countries may ship 37.5 million to 43.5 million bushels in the second half of the year. The estimated surplus grain (excluding rice) that can be utilized during this period from wheat-producing countries, namely the United States, Canada, Argentina, and Australia, totals 375-435 million bushels, and from countries producing corn, oats, and barley, namely the United States, Canada, Argentina, Brazil, and other countries, totals 48 million bushels.

Regarding how the United States can achieve the export target of 22.5 million bushels, if the wheat used for feed and seeds from January to June can be reduced to 90 million tons, and the storage volume after July 1 can be reduced to 150 million bushels, then 440 million bushels can be obtained for domestic consumption and export. Domestic demand in the United States is approximately 250 million bushels, leaving less than 200 million bushels for export needs. Approximately 100 million bushels of wheat were shipped in the first three months of this year. Therefore, the problem currently facing the US government seems to be how to transfer wheat used for feed and domestic applications to make up for the additional need of 25 million bushels to achieve the export target of 22.5 million bushels. Even if successful in two months, the gap between the need of 78.4 million bushels and the supply of 48.3 million bushels still cannot be filled.

### Frequent Transactions in Silk Goods; Rayon Has Become Firm and Stable

Yesterday, the market price of rayon showed signs of firmness and stability. The current price of 120-count Tianqiao bright silk was a minimum of 300,000 to 310,000 yuan and a maximum of 310,000 to 330,000 yuan in the morning. In the afternoon, it was still priced at 300,000 yuan, the same as the previous day. There were transactions in miscellaneous brands, with prices around 110,000 to 120,000 yuan. Factory silk with high uniformity was very stable, with asking prices similar to the previous two days. User silk was also quite firm and stable. The price of dried silk warp slightly increased by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan, with 500,000 yuan for five piculs. Transactions in silk goods were frequent, and prices increased. Yesterday morning, the price of Meiya bed sheets was 1.38 million yuan, 80,000 yuan higher than the previous day. The price of Dacheng plaid was 4,880 yuan, and it went beyond 5,000 yuan in the afternoon. Other goods from Shenghang also reported price increases.

Recently, Fenhans have also come to inquire, so the market sentiment has been greatly stimulated, and the asking prices of holders are mostly optimistic. Taiwan black tea and Qimen tea cores have all hit new highs, and other teas have also shown their edge compared to before. As for the foreign-managed tea market, at present, it only relies on the preference of African and Moroccan regions for Zhenmei tea with good quality. Jardine Matheson is still discussing with the owners, while other countries are silent.

### Tianjin Tea Price Limit

[Tianjin News] The Social Affairs Bureau of Tianjin has imposed a price limit on tea prices and has ordered the industry association to set prices and strictly prohibit unauthorized increases. The agreed prices are as follows: Huada Fang, Huaxiao Ye, and black tea, with a maximum price of 16,000 yuan and a minimum price of 1,600 yuan. Longjing Biluo, with a maximum price of 16,000 yuan and a minimum price of 3,300 yuan. Tea powder, with a maximum price of 9,600 yuan and a minimum price of 961 yuan. All prices are per 1,000 catties.

### Both Green and White Sugar Markets are Firm

Yesterday, only Zhongsha white sugar was flat due to a large amount of spot goods, while other sugars were mostly firm. The current price of the association's distribution disk was initially 70,500 yuan in the morning, then slightly decreased to 70,250 to 70,000 yuan. Substandard goods were 68,000 yuan, then 68,750 to 68,500 yuan. Warehouse warrants were 68,000 to 68,500 yuan. In the afternoon, current goods were 70,000 yuan, company goods were 71,000 yuan, and the price of Quan Zhou white sugar was 68,000 yuan. Diaaoqing was 54,500 yuan, and the next grade was 52,000 to 3,000 yuan. Gao Gong powder was asking for 80,000 yuan, and Ti Zhuang Qing was asking for 62,000 yuan. Oil-cotton red was 75,000 yuan, but no transactions were made.

### Soap Factory Sales Increase; Asphalt Prices Rise

As asphalt has become active in soap production, the market situation has gradually improved. The goods stored in this city have also been gradually cleared, totaling approximately 20,000 to 30,000 pieces. The opening price of Neiping oil from Youhang has increased from 46,000 yuan to 52,000 yuan, and the opening price of Shuanglian blue oil containing water has increased from 35,000 yuan to 40,000 yuan. Hangzhou has also been affected. Hanghang has sold Neiping oil for 47,000 yuan and Shuanglian blue oil for 40,000 yuan, both delivered in Hangzhou. Soap factory demand is now in season, and the situation may improve further. However, with prices at this level, Han asphalt is also worthwhile. If the Yangtze River transportation is smooth, Han asphalt can provide assistance, and the supply in Shanghai will not be lacking. Therefore, even if there is a price increase in the market, it will be limited. Dealers' selling prices have increased with the market, with current prices at 65,000 yuan for the current carload, 57,000 to 58,000 yuan for Neiping oil, 55,000 yuan for Duji, 52,000 yuan for Diqian oil, 46,000 to 47,000 yuan for Lan oil, and 44,000 yuan for Macheng oil.

### How to Enter Sipingjie and Changchun into the National Army's Control

— Special Correspondent Han Qingtao, Shenyang Air Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 23rd

The National Army's capture of Sipingjie immediately lifted the stagnation in the Northeast. At the same time, this also marked the prelude to the National Army's entry into Changchun. This high-speed military development laid the groundwork for political negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party.

Starting from Sipingjie, one after another, Gongzhuling, Xi'an, Yitong, Liaoyuan, Fenghua (Zhishu), Guojiadian, and other large and small strongholds were successively abandoned by the Communist army and fell into the embrace of the National Army. This all indicates the inevitable fate of Changchun.

Sipingjie, after two months of occupation, had its outskirts constructed with layers of fortifications. Bunkers and trenches were interconnected, and even rails and steel plates were utilized. The number of stationed troops was also extremely large. The original plan was to defend it to the death, as the Communist army once regarded it as "Stalingrad."

After the National Army's northern route captured Tieling, Kaiyuan, Changtu, and other places, its northward advance fell into a state of stagnation. In addition to encountering many difficulties, it was also reorganizing and waiting for reinforcements to deal with the large force that the Communist army was said to have deployed in the front.

Since the late March, when the National Army advanced in three routes along the north and south of the Middle-East Railway and the Fushun line on the east side, the northern route pointing to Changchun was led by the Sun Corps, dressed in American-style uniforms. Deputy Army Commander Jia led this group of strong men, mostly born in the southeast, to advance. Tieling, Kaiyuan, and Changtu encountered many difficulties and hardships along the way. In addition, there were heartbreaking battles. In the end, they overcame the difficulties and achieved military victories.

The Liao Corps, responsible for the right wing, led by General Zong Xiang, was initially tasked with the arduous mission of receiving the area between Shenyang and Yingkou. As a result, in a difficult environment, they fought all the way to Yingkou by the sea. Now, they have been transferred to the northern route. The Chen Mingren Corps on the left wing is a new force. The cooperation of the three routes achieved this mission.

The various armies pressed toward Sipingjie. On the National Army's side, the order was given on the 14th. The Communist army initially planned to defend Sipingjie with the spirit of the Soviet army defending "Stalingrad." However, after only making contact with a few strongholds outside Sipingjie, their resolve wavered. Although reporters were unable to obtain information from the Communist army's side, it seemed that they realized that the National Army was determined to take it, that the flanking forces were advancing rapidly, and that their own situation was unfavorable. Knowing that the overall situation was lost, they made a hasty retreat.

At dawn on the 19th, the Communist army rushed out its last batch of personnel from the northwest corner of Sipingjie. The National Army entered the city at dawn that day. Thus, the battle of Sipingjie, which was currently crucial to the victory or defeat of the Kuomintang and Communist forces in the Northeast, fortunately did not result in major bloodshed, and the lives and property of the people were not greatly sacrificed, ending the final act.

### City of Beans, Extremely Important Position

Sipingjie is the capital of Liaobei Province and the seat of Sipingjie City. The Middle-East Railway runs through it from north to south. To the east is the Pingmei Railway—Sipingjie to Meihekou, and to the west is the Pingqi Railway—Sipingjie northwest to Qiqihar. These three main railway lines form a large intersection in Sipingjie. Reaching the coast to the south, connecting to the Soviet Union to the north, linking to Korea to the east, and connecting to Mongolia to the west, as a result, this place has been created into a colonization area with convenient transportation and an important strategic position.

The urban area is quite large, with a population of approximately 88,000 people. The establishment of the province and city has created the prosperity of Sipingjie, and commerce and industry are increasingly flourishing. As a result, the population has increased from 60,000 to the aforementioned number.

However, the main reasons for its prosperity are transportation and agricultural products. Sipingjie Province is located in the center of the fertile land of Liaobei. The yields of soybeans, sorghum, and corn are extremely abundant. Sipingjie City is a major distribution center, known as the "Eastern Mountain Granary Area." Also, because of the abundance of soybeans, it has the beautiful name of "City of Beans." In the future, it will also occupy an important position in international agricultural trade.

There are many coal mines and limestone mines near Sipingjie. In terms of industry, there are flour mills, oil presses, etc. Among them, there are more oil presses, so it also has the reputation of "Oil Chemical Industry."

Sipingjie City was originally divided into two districts, "Daoli" and "Dao wai," by the "Middle-East Railway" running vertically through it. The west is Daoli, and the east is Dao wai. Neither district has traces of war, and the stores are all open. The train station is an exception. New wounds and old scars are vividly visible. The overpass crossing the railway has also been destroyed. From the outside, Sipingjie does not have much trauma, but the damage suffered in spirit and material is very serious. Liu Lundong, Chairman of Liaobei Province, and Yang Zhusun, Mayor, arrived in Sipingjie on the 20th and announced that they would immediately start restoration work.

### Changchun's Vanguard, The Strategic Gongzhuling

The various National Army troops actively advanced. On the 21st, the central route first used rapid troops to detour to the area north of Gongzhuling, and the main force rapidly advanced into Gongzhuling. The western route pressed toward Liaoyuan, and troops entered Yitong. Another force entered Xi'an from the southeast. According to investigations, the coal reserves in Xi'an are 500 million tons. The urban area has a large-scale thermal power plant. When the Communist army retreated, it planned to destroy it. Fortunately, there was not enough time, and workers obstructed it, so it is still intact. If it can be used well, the power generation is 120,000 kilowatts, which can solve the power shortage in parts of Shenyang.

Gongzhuling is the vanguard city of Changchun. It is located at the watershed of the Liao River Basin and the Songhua River Basin. To the north, it extends from Huaide to Tongyang, a winding range of ancient hills hundreds of kilometers long. It is strategically defensible in military terms. The puppet Manchukuo established it as a city in 1942. The urban area covers an area of 864 square kilometers, with a population of approximately 50,000 people. In terms of industry, there are oil presses, wineries, rice mills, and brick factories.

### Rushing Forward, Changchun Reappears in Dawn Light

The Middle-East Railway runs vertically through the city center from north to south. To the north and south of the railway, a bridge about 86 meters long crosses the railway, connecting the commercial district and the old city area. The commercial district has many specialty products, while the old city area has many old-style residences. The "Gongzhuling National Agricultural Experiment Station" was quite well-known during the puppet Manchukuo period. After the Communist army lost Gongzhuling, Changchun immediately exposed the Sun Corps on the front. It rushed forward from Sipingjie. It reached Guojiadian on the 20th, Gongzhuling on the 21st, Fanjatun on the 22nd, and detoured to the left wing of Changchun on the 23rd. At this time, the troops of the Liao Corps, in a lightning-like manner, entered Changchun City at noon on the 23rd. The important area of Changchun thus fell into the arms of the National Army and was again under the jurisdiction of the central government.

Fortunately, the rapid military changes between Sipingjie and Changchun did not result in very tragic bloodshed. More startling was that the Communist army blew up the railway bridges north and south of Sipingjie and burned the brick, stone, and wood bridges on the highway. To the south of Changchun, this was not possible due to time constraints.

When will the military actions in the Northeast unfold? When will political negotiations succeed? These are things that everyone cares about, and the people of the Northeast have a particularly personal pain. Fortunately, from various perspectives, the situation in the Northeast has already revealed the dawn of peace, or it may be the time of dawn!

### Twenty-Nine Days in Changchun

— Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi

The Communist army in the Northeast has now been unified and organized. The so-called "Democratic Allied Army" of 300,000 is a mystery and is currently expanding continuously. In Changchun, we only saw the Eighth Route Army speaking Shandong dialect. Everywhere on the streets, we saw typewritten slogans of "Welcome to Join the Army" and "Army Enrollment Office" written on the walls.

According to Zhou Baozhong's announcement in a frank discussion with us on the evening of the 25th, the organization of the "Democratic Allied Army" has three parts: One is the Eighth Route Army, led by Peng Zhen; the second is the "Northeast People's Self-Defense Army," formerly known as the "Northeast Anti-Japanese Allied Army," led by Zhou Baozhong. Zhou claimed to have 150,000 to 200,000 people, an unspecified number; the third is the New Fourth Army and the old Northeast Army. The New Fourth Army has only a thousand people, led by Lin Biao. The Northeast Army is led by Lu Zhengcao, Zhang Xueliang, Wan Yi, and others. Lu Zhengcao announced that the number of Northeast Army troops under their command is now a full 100,000.

### Banquet of the Northeast Bureau

The overall leadership organization is the "Democratic Allied Army General Headquarters," with Lin Biao as the Commander-in-Chief, and Lu Zhengcao, Zhou Baozhong, and Xiao Jingguang as the Deputy Commanders, and Peng Zhen and Luo Ronghuan as the Political Commissars. Zhou is the Commander of the Eastern Manchuria Army, and Lu is the Commander of the Western Manchuria Army. These forces can be said to have appeared in the Northeast completely after Japan's surrender.

As Zhang Xuesi told reporters, he left the pass in September last year, leading no more than 2,000 old Northeast Army soldiers, but now he has 25,000. This will be discussed separately in another section. Not to mention the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army. Zhou Baozhong particularly clarified that the Communist army only goes to places where the Soviet army does not go.

As for the "Northeast People's Self-Defense Army," according to Zhou Baozhong, its predecessor was the Northeast Anti-Japanese Allied Army. "The Anti-Japanese Allied Army was established in 1935." He said: "The Northeast People's Revolutionary Army and local guerrilla forces, after reorganization and unified command, formed eleven armies. Constantly fighting the Japanese army, starting in 1938, the Japanese army constantly 'suppressed' us. In the winter of that year and throughout 1939, the Allied Army suffered heavy losses. Villages related to the Anti-Japanese Allied Army were burned and killed. For example, in Fusong County, Dongman, 5,000 to 6,000 ginseng farmers (each with about ten people) were completely destroyed by the enemy. In the puppet Sanjiang Province and Mudanjiang Province, 800,000 houses were burned down. At this time, the Anti-Japanese Allied Army reached its most difficult period, living almost entirely in the ice and snow, mountains, and dense forests, and having to exchange blood and flesh for a meal. Allied Army generals Yang Jingyu, Zhao Shangzhi, etc., died in battle between 1939 and 1941, while Xie Wendong and Li Huatang surrendered to the enemy."

The Anti-Japanese Allied Army can be said to have completely collapsed in 1941. Zhou Baozhong said that at this time, they could only "hide, carry out covert activities, and decentralized activities."

From then on, from 1941 to 1945, according to Zhou Baozhong, there were still several battles in the forests of Jidong, the Hinggan Mountains in eastern and western northern Manchuria during those five years. Zhou Baozhong used this to prove that the Northeast Anti-Japanese Allied Army still existed. Zhou Baozhong himself is now in Changchun, talking to us. He is the Commander of the Fifth Army of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army. His catchphrase is: "I fought the Japanese devils in the Northeast for fourteen years."

As for the situation after the Soviet Union declared war on Japan, he said in another conversation: "The situation in Manchuria suddenly changed. The Northeast Anti-Japanese Allied Army turned to carry out extensive and active activities, vigorously expanding this patriotic force to respond to the Red Army, and launching a war behind enemy lines, and in the Soviet-occupied areas helped to maintain order, communicate Sino-Soviet friendship, and carry out democratic construction. Currently, the Allied Army in Dongman and Beiman alone has reached 150,000 people."

On the 25th, we were still not free. Zhou Baozhong came to our residence. Naturally, we talked from 8:00 PM, and after eating dinner, we continued to talk until 12:30 AM. We asked him why they wanted to attack Changchun. He replied:

"From February 4th to 9th, the National Army occupied Panshan and Taian. At this time, the CCP Central Committee agreed to the National Army taking over Shenyang, Changchun, and Harbin after the Soviet army withdrew. The Communist army expanded 30 li on both sides of the railway, but the Northeast issue had to be resolved through consultation. The CCP Central Committee notified us that the three-person group might come to the Northeast before March 5th, but they did not come. In March, the Chinese army attacked Fushun, Yingkou, Anshan, and Benxi Lake again. From March 15th to 20th, the CCP Central Committee sent a telegram to each family saying: 'Peace is hopeless.' The National Army advanced north to Kaiyuan again. We were beaten everywhere. Changchun is very close to Jilin. The security team in Changchun was reorganized from the puppet army. They had fought against us in the past. I had been injured five times, all by this group of iron and stone troops. They were reorganized by the government. We were already dissatisfied. The puppet army can enter Changchun, but we, who fought the Japanese devils for fourteen years, are not qualified to enter Changchun? And their garrison is only 40 kilometers away from Jilin. In order to defend ourselves, we must take action. So I expressed my opinion to the Northeast Bureau and decided to attack Changchun."

On May 1st, the CCP Northeast Bureau came to Changchun, and we saw Peng Zhen, the Secretary of the Northeast Bureau, as well as Lu Zhengcao and Zhang Xuesi. According to Kaifeng, who told Shenzhi, Lin Biao is on the front line in Sipingjie.

As soon as the CCP Northeast Bureau arrived in Changchun, their attitude towards us completely changed.

Initially, Liu Juying, the new mayor of Changchun, invited us to eat at the Yamato Hotel on May 2nd. Liu Juying was in the position of the host, but he was silent, only Zhou Baozhong spoke. He told us at the meeting that eight of the nine provinces in the Northeast have democratically elected chairmen. He announced the list as follows:

Liaoning: Zhang Xuesi, Jilin: Zhou Baoping, Andong: Gao Chongmin, Nenjiang: Yu Yifu, Che Xiangchen (Deputy) Heilongjiang: Li Yanlu, Songjiang: Feng Zhongyun, Liaobei: Li Youwen (Deputy) Xing'an: None.

Among them are the elected chairmen or vice chairmen, but I don't know if they are willing to come, or if they are not in the Northeast, so he is unwilling to tell us.

On May 4th, the Northeast Bureau invited us to eat at the Northeast Hotel. The layout of this restaurant is not like the layout of businessmen, but a new layout of political workers. There are in the hallway, and Zhu De and Mao Zedong's portraits in the dining room, with Sun Yat-sen's portrait in the middle.

Peng Zhen is one of the CCP committee members from Yan'an. Lin Biao, Chen Yun, Luo Ronghuan, and Lu Zhengcao are also central committee members and members of the Northeast Bureau. Zhou Baozhong is not a central committee member, but he is also one of the members of the Northeast Bureau.

Peng Zhen is tall, a Shanxi native, with an aura of Yan and Zhao, a rosy complexion, and a strict political stance and gentle tone in his speech. He said:

"Among the nine provinces in the Northeast, eight provinces have provincial assemblies, except for the Mongolian part. Regarding Mongolia, we approve of their implementation of local autonomy, according to the principles of the first National Congress. Just like the United States, there are many dots on the national flag. These many dots are like various ethnic groups, so China can become a harmonious country."

In his reply to inquiries about the Mongolian issue, he said: "There are no communists among the Mongolians."

Regarding the Mongolian autonomy issue, the CCP has not learned the details, but Lu Zhengcao said: The leading figure in the autonomy movement is Boyan Mandu. In the past, during the puppet Manchukuo era, he was the Governor of the puppet Xing'an South Province.

Shenzhi then asked: "Boyan Mandu was an official of the puppet government. He is now engaged in the autonomy movement. Then, according to the CCP's policy, is there anything inconsistent?"

Peng Zhen and Lu Zhengcao replied: "This depends on the meaning of the Mongolian people and has nothing to do with us. We cannot stop the Mongolian people from supporting him."

We also asked:

"How many of the nine provinces in the Northeast are currently under the control of the Communist army?"

At this time, Peng Zhen, Zhou Baozhong, Lu Zhengcao, and Kaifeng, who were present, calculated and prepared to answer this question. At first, everyone was quite straightforward, saying that all areas except those where the National Army is located are under the control of the Communist army. However, Lippmann insisted on asking how many tenths.

"Oh, this is difficult to calculate, we have never counted." Peng Zhen said, "It can be said that south to Yingkou, east to Fushun, west to Shanhaiguan, and north to south of Sipingjie are all National Army areas. In terms of population, our area accounts for 70 percent, and in terms of area, it accounts for 85 percent."

"Okay, excluding Mongolia." Zhou Baozhong added, "The area also accounts for 70 percent, two 70 percents."

However, when asked about the situation north of Qiqihar, they said they were not clear, and the Communist army had not yet gone to take over.

Shenzhi mentioned the issue of industrial construction in the Northeast and asked Peng Zhen what the CCP Northeast Bureau's research results were. He replied:

"The research results believe that if there is no obstacle, it can be fully restored to its original state in three years."

Albena asked: "Do you plan to use American aid?"

"This depends on the goals of the United States," Peng replied.

Shenzhi then asked: "So, what conditions are these three years of recovery based on?"

"Based on political conditions, as long as there is democracy and peace, three years will not be a problem."

Therefore, Shenzhi doubly asked if there were experts studying this issue. Peng Zhen said: "Several secretaries in our place are studying this issue."

"However, there is very little industrial destruction," Peng Zhen continued, "I went to Fushun to see, and only 20-30% was lost. The industrial equipment dismantled and transported by the Soviet Union was limited to military industry."

When we contacted CCP personnel, they were unwilling to provide any theoretical explanation on this issue, only saying that it was a controversial issue. The controversy is limited to theory, but we have never argued, and the facts are undeniable. Several of us have gone to Fushun to see, so Shenzhi said to Peng Zhen

"I have also seen Fushun. For example, the thermal power plant in Fushun is a power component. Naturally, the military industry also needs power, but 90% of the Qi Ro quantity was dismantled. Other losses in the oil refinery, liquefaction plant, and electric boiler are also huge. Even if we come to make theoretical arguments now, it will not help." Peng Zhen was silent. (To be continued)

### Successful Wireless Telephone Call Test Between Lanzhou and Nanjing

— Our Newspaper Lanzhou 25th Air Dispatch Reporter Bingzi

The direct wireless telephone call test between Lanzhou and Nanjing was successful. It has been officially opened this week, and the business hours are scheduled from 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM every day.

The Ministry of Social Affairs allocated 14 million yuan of winter relief grants to Gansu Province, which has now arrived in Lanzhou. The Provincial Department of Social Affairs will use this fund to supplement the relief centers in various counties.

Xining News: Following the completion of the reorganization of the National Army stationed in Qinghai, the Qinghai Provincial Security Team has also completed its reorganization.

### The Cry of the Exiles (1)

Mr. Editor:

We know that your newspaper has always upheld justice and can speak up for the people. Therefore, we timidly wrote an article, hoping that you would publish it in your esteemed newspaper immediately so that we may gain sympathy from society and receive some much-needed assistance. We are truly pitiful and miserable! Respectfully, the Wandering People of Fudan University.

I am from a village in the southeastern corner of northern Jiangsu – Qihai – and can also be considered a member of this large group of exiled youths. I have my own home, my own fields, gray-haired parents, a wife who follows me, and children who play around my knees – everything that is dear and beloved. Yet, yet (I want to use a hundred "yets"), what is it now? My home has been occupied and divided by a group of "democratic" "believers" who "take the property of others as their own"! My village? It has "changed color" and is now under the rule of another "imperial power"! My fields? They have been forcibly seized! My garden? It is desolate! My father? He lives in constant anxiety and holds his breath! My mother? She cries all the time! My wife? She suffers the same fate as me, being imprisoned, coerced, and threatened! My children? They are fostered or working as servants! Everything that is dear and beloved? It is over, destroyed! I have not committed any crimes, I have not been a traitor, but I do not know why I have to suffer such cruel, miserable, barbaric, and despicable... punishment? Did we commit some sin in our previous lives? However, that is "idealistic," and we should now be talking about "materialism," so this answer seems somewhat incorrect. Someone told me: you yourself have not committed any crimes, but your property has. But I also think that my property is based on the rights that the law grants me. This right is not only held by me alone, and I did not obtain it through cunning or deception; it is the reward I deserve for my labor. So this answer is also questionable. Someone else told me: "It's because you are not a believer in the 'New Democracy' 'bible,' otherwise you would never be exiled and lose everything. Not only would you not be exiled or plundered, but you could also share some of 'other people's property as' your 'own property.'" I vaguely understand this answer because I have not studied the history of the Russian Revolution, so I am not clear about this principle. However, I think I am not a red-haired, green-eyed foreigner, so why are some people determined to bring foreign goods to China and make us innocent youths suffer? But why I have to suffer this kind of punishment, I still don't understand.

Although this is my personal experience, there is no need to shout loudly and waste my breath. However, I believe that there is definitely more than one person who has the same experience as me, and there are quite a few of them. If you don't believe me, please take a look at this large group here who want to ask you to appeal to the government authorities and make the following appeal to the reasonable and intelligent compatriots in China:

The War of Resistance has been won, and the enemy has been driven away. Everyone in every corner of China is clear about this, and even the traitors who echoed the enemy cannot deny it. Today, after the victory of the War of Resistance, do we need to kill each other? Do we need to fight this city today and that city tomorrow, causing the people to suffer from eight years of war? Is that not enough? Should we suffer even more cruel massacres? This group of rogue soldiers who are like devils say that "to obtain the truth, we must struggle," and handing over the world to you is "the truth," right? Satisfying your desire to kill is "the truth," right? Now let me first talk about the situation in the southeastern corner of northern Jiangsu – Qihai – and then talk about my request for appeal and appeal:

(1) Warlords occupying territory – During the War of Resistance, China was divided into three parts. Now that victory has been won, the Japanese devils have collapsed, and the accompanying ugly creatures have also scattered. There are still two parts left. One is the so-called "recovered area," and the other is the so-called "liberated area." I am not clear about the situation in the "recovered area" and other "liberated areas." What I know is the situation in the "Southeastern Region" is like this: although the enemy has fled, it seems like it is still on the eve of a great war. Young and strong men have to join the army, starting from the most hardworking militia and gradually rising to the district team, the regiment, and the main force. They only want to confront the central government and govern themselves.

(2) Blocking materials – During the War of Resistance, it was absolutely necessary to block materials in order to reduce the enemy's supplies. But now, the war has ended, and overall victory has been achieved, but our "Southeastern Region" is still in a wartime state no less than when we were fighting the enemy. Without the permission of the local "government," all food, cotton, and other local products are not allowed to be exported. If you resist, you will be fined and confiscated, "taken to the official's office," and there are many tricks. All the big and small merchants are crying out in pain – no, that's not right. It should be said that all the big and small merchants are "rejoicing," celebrating that we have won, "liberated," and "democratized"!

(3) Numbing the youth – It doesn't matter if you are a middle school student, elementary school student, or are currently a student, or were a student in the past. In short, as long as you have some knowledge, or are preparing to have some knowledge, you have the "qualification" and "right" to be forced to read newspapers and books such as "Xinhua Daily," "Jianghai Daobao," and "New Outlook on Life," until your brain is indeed dyed red to the point of turning black. If you are indeed stubborn and unyielding, then you are guaranteed to wear the most fashionable top hat called "reactionary," and then you are in danger. There are militia elders monitoring you at any time, and you are also at risk of being detained and killed at any time.

(4) Forcibly demanding public grain – Paying taxes is the duty of the people, but "relatives and friends should not owe debts." If you owe debts, be prepared to eat hemp rope. Rent has been reduced, reduced by 25%, but you still have to give discounts to show "big discounts." What kind of discounts? It depends, 60% or 70% are available, and 40% or 50% are also available. Therefore, the general middle class and above cannot express their suffering. If you say you are suffering, you are "reactionary" and "look down on the government."

(5) Compelling the use of Communist currency – In our "liberated area," central government currency is not allowed to be used. It is said that this is "reactionary" currency, and the liberated area should use "democratic" currency. What happens if you use it? To be polite, it is confiscated, but not destroyed. Destroying it is still money after all, which is a pity. It is the common people and merchants who are not allowed to use it, but not the militia officials. Why? The reason is that the citizens of our great Republic of China have always been "only allowing officials to set fires, but not allowing the common people to light lamps." Don't forget this! So what kind of currency can be used without breaking the law? There are many types, and the illiterate folks are really confused. There are local currencies from the "Southeastern Region," "Jianghuai Bank notes," "Zhejiang East Bank notes," and "Central China Bank notes." It's a pity that our common people don't have guns and banknote printing machines, otherwise it would be a way to make money!

(6) Arbitrarily assigning donations – You are sitting at home, and militia elders, the "directors" and "comrades" of the Agricultural Resistance Association and the Return Resistance Association often come to your home to extort you. They want money, food, clothes, pants, shoes, mosquito nets, bedsheets, anything is fine, especially when it is the season, you are simply so busy that you have to deal with them. Sometimes it is said to be for comforting "local officials," and sometimes it is said to be for comforting "soldiers at the front." Moreover, the tax office is full of malpractices. Some people collect money without issuing receipts, and some people report less than the actual amount of goods. They offer some cigarettes, and everyone shares the profits, but no one can say it out loud.

(7) Violating public opinion – Since they advocate "democracy," they have to do some "democratic" gestures. When there are criminals, they have to hold public trials and small group discussions at night, which is considered to be soliciting public opinion, but the opinions are still predetermined by the brains of a few ruling classes. Can you object? Of course you can, not objecting is not "democratic," but please be careful afterward, you have been noticed by the authorities. Or before the meeting, the "democratic" "comrades" have already been ambushed, and they all pass the resolutions quickly, probably because they deeply know the psychology that "the masses are blind."

(8) Trampling on human rights – Autocracy is against the times, so democracy is catering to the times. However, the democracy that we, the people, demand, whether it is "new" or "old," is the real one, not the fake one. If there is only the beautiful name of democracy, but the actual practice is even worse than autocracy, then we, the people, simply find this kind of democracy somewhat hateful, frightening, pitiful, and detestable. In the southeastern corner of northern Jiangsu, what we generally hear is the sound of democracy, but what we encounter is the reality of autocracy. The people cannot talk about freedom of belief, residence, speech, and publication, and even the security of life and property is not guaranteed. As long as you do not associate with or appease the believers of democracy, you will be monitored or assassinated everywhere, and your property will be divided and occupied by others at any time. This kind of democracy, which promotes sheep's head but sells dog meat, is extremely disappointing.

In short, in the southeastern corner of northern Jiangsu – Qihai, 99.5% of the people are all eating Coptis chinensis (Chinese goldthread) like a mute, unable to express their suffering. Only the remaining 0.5% of the comrades are singing aloud, loudly playing the triumphal song of their wealth-making methods.

If we talk about the recent situation, it is heartbreaking. Merchants are affected by the blockade of materials, and local products cannot be transported out, foreign goods cannot be transported in, and currency cannot circulate. Now they have to pay business tax and be subject to the control of public stores and cooperatives, unable to trade freely. Farmers, in addition to the militia, also have to pay public grain, not getting any real benefits. The hope and enthusiasm for a day of "getting ahead" and "ascending to heaven" has also cooled down. Workers are subject to the supervision of foremen, and 10% of the wages they earn with their own efforts are taken away as commissions for the foremen. If they don't flatter the foremen, they won't be assigned work. Scholars are the most miserable. They hate their ancestors, wondering why they spent money to let them study, causing them to be dragged around by others, unable to move at all. Because they know a few big words, they are wrongly killed, and no one knows how many.

The above is a very brief report. Now I want to talk about my three opening points:

(1) A request to you, sir – We know that you, sir, are the mouthpiece of the people. We hope that you can help us, this group of exiled youths, to suggest a good way to the government to resettle us and to find ways to rescue us from social figures. We are already a group of homeless and pitiful people! We are already a group of people wandering around without a home! We, more than thirty people, are about to starve to death! Sir, please save us!

(2) An accusation to the government – The officials in the central government: you are high above, do you still know the suffering of the people? Do you still know that large numbers of young people are leaving their villages and fleeing to the cities? I think you must have heard of this. But why have you always remained silent and not had an appropriate way to protect and arrange for us? What are you busy with every day? The suffering of the people is not alleviated, and you are just pretending to be deaf and dumb. Do you feel ashamed in your conscience? We, these more than thirty people, were all gathered unintentionally from various villages and towns who fled to the counties and cities because they could not bear the oppression of "democracy." But now the counties and cities have fallen again and have been occupied by the Communist army, so we have to flee to the south of the Yangtze River. We are already a group of people who cannot return to our hometowns and cannot see our parents! There are houses of various heights, and there are good and bad things to eat, but these all belong to other people, and we cannot "share" them casually. The few coins we carried in our rush to escape are about to run out, and we will starve to death if we don't die of anger! The big officials of the government, please save us! I hope you will truly act like an "official" and "leader," stand up straight, shoulder the responsibility, and don't fail the important task entrusted to you by the country and the earnest expectations of the people!

(3) An appeal to society – Fathers, brothers, sisters, aunts: now you are living a comfortable and leisurely life of peace and prosperity, but have you heard of the life in another world lived by the descendants of the Yellow Emperor who are the same as you, a completely different life? We are about to not have enough food to eat and not have enough clothes to wear! Why? Because we are living a life of escape! Why do we have to escape? Do you know what is called the "Three Capitals Movement"? The so-called three capitals are "capital," "knowledge," and "reputation." These three types of people are the three types of people who are oppressed in the "liberated area." Now the government under the leadership of "New Democracy" has launched an attack on these three types of people! Therefore, these three types of people are fleeing one after another. After all, having a knife placed on your neck is scary! We have fled, but how do we get by? Dear compatriots! Don't think that you are now living in peace and prosperity. I believe that perhaps one day this knife will also be placed on you. Please be vigilant and aware. We hope that you will respond to us and provide relief.

Finally, we have an opinion for all the exiled youths: We are all unfortunate people in the world. We fully expected that after the victory, we would still be living a life of escape that was even worse than when the enemy and puppets were invading. We also never thought that in the 20th century, the barbaric autocratic politics of Qin Shi Huang burning books and burying scholars would reappear in the civilized world! We also never thought that the "anti-enemy people" who taught us to sing the three songs of exile would turn their faces and tell us to go into exile! After thinking about it, we think that such scattered escape will make us suffer for the rest of our lives and never be able to return to our hometowns. We want to "fight back to our hometown"! We must unite and organize ourselves, and then ask the government to protect and resettle us, and ask society to provide us with relief and assistance. Only in this way can we have strength.

Spring and Autumn

### On Social Organization (Part 1)

—傅统先 (Fu Tongxian)

Society is organized by the people, but society is not just a union or sum of the people. Here, the society we are talking about is a broad sense, it refers to any group organized by individuals, such as literary research associations, football teams, youth associations, Red Cross, political parties, governments, etc. What this article wants to explain is that social groups like this are a kind of organized association between individuals, and not a sum of many individuals mechanically pieced together.

The relationship between the individual and society is a question that has not been settled in sociology. Some people argue that society is just an empty name, and only the individual is real. Society has nothing other than the individual. Others argue that only society is real. The individual cannot exist without society. The individual in society is equal to a part of the whole. In fact, both of these statements are partially correct, but neither is completely correct. We argue on the one hand that the individual is a necessary condition for society, and on the other hand that society is a supra-personal entity. We say that the individual is a necessary condition for society, which means that if there were no individuals, then there would be no society. However, simply having many individuals does not constitute a society. Suppose there are many people in the same room, some are reading, some are reading newspapers, some are talking, some are playing ball, and these many individuals who "go their own way" are united together does not equal a group. We say that society is a supra-personal entity, which means that although society is organized and successful by individuals, society is above the individual. It has its own characteristics of existence, and is not equal to the sum of many personalities. For example, water is successfully organized by H2 and O, but the characteristics of water are not equal to the characteristics of H2 and the characteristics of O. Another example is that a house is built by many wooden boards, bricks, tiles, mud, and ash. But we cannot say: "A house is the sum of several wooden boards, tiles, mud, and ash." The reason why a house is a house is because it exceeds its organizational factors and has its own characteristics.

Now we further ask what are the supra-personal characteristics of society? The simple answer is that the reason why society becomes what it is is because there is only one goal, only one organization system, and only one leadership organization among many individuals. In a social organization, there can only be one general goal shared by many individuals. A literary research association can be established because many individuals want to jointly study literature. If in the same place, some people are reciting poetry, some are propagating political views, and some are in love, we cannot say that this is a literary research association. Under the same social organization, the individual has a universal will that surpasses his own will. The universal will is neither a mysterious force nor the sum of many individual wills. The so-called sum of individual wills is to add up the individual wills of Zhang San who wants to study literature, Li Si who wants to propagate political views, Zhao who wants to fall in love with Ms. Qian. The universal will is the will that all individuals have in common. Zhang San wants to study literature, Li Si, Zhao Da, and Qian Er all want to study literature, and this forms the universal will. This universal will is not unique to any one of them, but is common to them. So although it is not separated from the individual, it transcends the individual.

Since society is built on the same goal, then it can only have one organization system. The so-called organization system is a tool for carrying out work to achieve goals. The effectiveness of this tool is that it can use the most flexible and economical way to fully realize the goal. This organization can only belong to one system. If there are two different goals, then there will inevitably be two different administrative organization systems. But under the same goal, if there are two different organization systems at the same time, the result is either destroying this common goal or reducing the effectiveness of achieving this goal.

The leader of society is one or a few prophets and seers. They see this common goal clearly, grasp the power of the masses, and promote the most effective administrative mechanism in order to fully achieve this goal. He is an organizer, a promoter, and at the same time a person who satisfies the needs of the public. The leader is the representative of the masses. He represents the masses to express their wishes; he represents the masses to fight for their goals. Society has only one goal, so it can only have one leader. One leader does not refer to the dictatorship of one person. One leader refers to a small core group of prophets and seers who are integrated and bear the responsibility of leading the masses. If there are two leading organizations, then conflicts are prone to occur between them. As a result, not only do the masses not benefit, but they are at a loss as to what to do, where to go, and even be exploited to the point where their lives are ruined and the people are in dire straits.

### A Brief Review of the Victory Exhibition of the Shanghai Artists Association

— Zhu Chang

After the establishment of the Shanghai Artists Association, it immediately began preparations for its first exhibition in celebration of victory. After a month of preparation, it was held simultaneously from May 31st to June 6th at the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association as the east venue and the China Painting Garden as the west venue. The exhibits included six or seven hundred pieces of calligraphy, traditional Chinese painting, Western painting, seal engraving, and photography, with over two hundred and fifty participating artists. It brought together Chinese and Western art under one roof, creating a magnificent spectacle, an unprecedented event in the Shanghai art world since the Anti-Japanese War. Therefore, visitors flocked to see it in large numbers every day.

There were not many photography exhibits. Lang Jingshan's "Yellow Mountain Clouds and Mist" was still the most outstanding. Ao Sihong's photographs also possessed unique insights. There were few seal engraving exhibits. Tao Shoubo's were vigorous and classic, and Fang Jiekans's were even and profound, naturally standing out among them. There were very few sculptures, with no particularly eye-catching works. This field still needs development. This is probably due to the social environment, making development difficult in the short term. Western paintings were generally divided into oil paintings and watercolors. In oil paintings, Zhang Chongren's large hospital painting was the most striking. With beautiful colors and accurate human figures, it was a rare work in the modern Western painting world. However, the overall composition lacked unity and seemed somewhat scattered, and the emotional aspect felt too bland, lacking a sense of tension. Ran Xi's watercolors were skilled in depicting morning mists and evening glows, with vigorous brushstrokes and a seamless integration of sunlight and water. He was able to express extremely complex objects with extremely simple strokes, making him a masterpiece in watercolor. Western paintings were displayed in the China Painting Garden, where the direction of the easels was originally suitable for Chinese paintings but not very suitable for Western paintings. Therefore, the light entered from the side, either too dazzling to look at or too dark to see anything. The exhibitors should pay attention to lighting and not just focus on saving effort. In terms of painting style, the absence of Ji Weng's participation resulted in a lack of powerful works, which somewhat detracted from the exhibition. Wang Fuchang had more than enough purity but lacked boldness. Ma Gongyu excelled in elegance but lacked unrestrainedness. Only Feng Wenfeng's powerful brushstrokes could be considered outstanding.

Traditional Chinese paintings were the most numerous exhibits and the mainstay of the exhibition. Among them, there were many masterpieces, but it is a pity that they cannot all be listed. Based on what was seen, here is a brief description of the most impressive works. In recent years, the trend of painting fish has been quite popular. Wang Shizi excels in brilliance; Liu Shi excels in beauty; and Wang Yachen excels in [blank space]. Each is able to establish their own style and compete in the realm of fish. There were also several painters of lions and tigers. Since Zhang Shanzi's death, his influence has not been seen. Xiong Songquan, though old, is still vigorous and must be regarded as the leading figure in this field. In terms of flowers and birds, there seemed to be few moving works, and there were also few remarkable figures. However, there were many painters of women, such as Wu Qingxia and Zhou Lianxia, who were both meticulous and glamorous but lacked character. Li Qiujun used little ink but was full of classic charm. Landscapes were the highlight of the traditional Chinese paintings. Zhang Bihan imitated Huang Gongwang, with a close resemblance in spirit and a tranquil atmosphere that reached perfection. Wu Zhenping imitated the ancients, placing alienation within the rules, with a pure and ancient air. He can be compared with Bihan. The works imitating the ancients can be considered the best of the best. Yu Jianwu has traveled all over the world, capturing famous mountains and rivers in his art. During the Anti-Japanese War, he also traveled to famous scenic spots in the southeast and recently returned to Shanghai. He will soon hold a solo exhibition of sketches of famous mountains. This time, he exhibited four works, all meticulously elegant, showing his true self, and his boldness and vigor could not be concealed. Is this not what is meant by "a hundred refined steel transformed into a gentle touch"? Zheng Wuchang's autumn mountain painting incorporated the methods of Shi Tao, Mei Qing, Qu Jushan, and Fei Danxu, using only dry ink and heavy colors, and can be considered a masterpiece. However, his two reed and willow paintings are rather thin, lacking a thick and lush charm, and are far from comparable to the autumn mountain painting. Zan Tianjian's large green and blue painting is brightly colored and eye-catching, created to celebrate victory, timely and in accordance with the occasion, with historical significance. Such a masterpiece may not be easily obtained by He [last name]. Feng Chaoran's ink painting is scattered and lacks spirit. It is said that he is too old and weak to paint. Wu Daiqiu's green and blue painting, although without the usual problem of repetition, is also somewhat empty and sparse. In addition, Wu Zhongxiong, Bei Xintai, Gu Kunbo, and others usually produce extremely exquisite works, but the works exhibited this time did not seem to be carefully chosen, which inevitably disappointed viewers. There were many immature works in the exhibition, and the review process seemed too lenient. It is hoped that this point will be improved in the second exhibition.

### Remaining Spring (Fiction)

— Zhong Qun

"Don't be jealous! I pity him, I don't love him, rest assured!" She leaned tightly against his chest and smiled sweetly.

A happy white-clad figure whispered and laughed in the corridor. Jian Guang could hear it clearly in bed. "Not love, but pity!" He sighed sadly, reached for the electric bell at the head of the bed, and asked the room attendant to move the pot of small red flowers on the tea table out. The room attendant asked strangely:

"It was just bought yesterday, and it has bloomed such a beautiful flower. Why do you want to move it out?" "I don't like the color red, I'm afraid of seeing red!"

The room attendant laughed strangely: "Then where should I move it to?"

"Anywhere, throw it away, give it away, take it yourself, anyway, I don't want it!"

"How about giving it to a female patient next door?" the room attendant asked.

"Okay, I already said anywhere you want."

As the room attendant carried the flowerpot out, the small red flower flickered in front of Jian Guang again. Only then did he see clearly that it was a red rose, small, but very beautiful.

A misty drizzle sprinkled on the glass window, drip-drop...

Xiuzhen was awakened by a slight sound of rain.

She turned over, touched her sweaty chest, and felt a chill all over her body: cold sweat, cold hands, cold feet, cold body, cold bedding.

And her heart also turned cold with worry!

The quiet ward, the quiet sound of rain, the bed sheets were white, the tablecloth on the tea table was white, the curtains on the window were white... everywhere was white, the white of death, with no other colors to break through this deathly white, especially red.

She knew she had had another dream, an empty dream, a vague dream, but so lovely! She wanted to grasp it!

Grasp it! She savored the dream!

In the dream, it was spring! Not a misty spring, but a glorious spring with sunshine.

She stood by the river, the riverbank was full of flowers, the water was green, the flowers were red. In the interplay of red and green, she saw a small white sail, swaying back and forth in the river.

A song came, and someone on the small sail was singing:

"Beautiful aunt!

Your eyes are like pearls,

Your lips are like gems,

Your slender waist,

Like an infinitely soft ribbon,

I ask to forever hold you tightly in my heart!

..."

What a familiar voice! Who is singing?

The song grew closer, the small sail grew closer, and she saw clearly: it was him!

Him! -

Pure white clothes, a pure white square face, young, handsome, like a noble and dignified lily, standing quietly in the center of the small sail, smiling at her.

Her heart pounded, her face burned, and timidly, softly, she called out: "Doctor He!"

Doctor He waved to her.

"What are you doing?" she asked shyly.

"Come here! You are mine, I love you!" Doctor He said softly.

She was so ashamed that her whole body was burning, but a gust of wind passed, and she was already in Doctor He's small sail.

The small sail was very narrow, and he leaned close to her body, like a ball of fire. She felt herself gradually melting, melting, melting so much that she couldn't tell where she was and where he was. …

The small sail drifted away, everywhere there were red flowers, green trees, blue sky, sunshine, … fragrant, passionate, … her and his spring, … she was so happy, she laughed ecstatically, but she woke up!

Woke up, and everything was gone! Only a deathly still ward, only a patch of dead white…

"Grasp it! Grasp it!" Xiuzhen still wanted to savor, still wanted to grasp that dream, but a violent "cough cough cough cough..." turned her face ashen, and cold sweat dripped down...

Lung disease - an ice arrow pierced her fragile heart!

Red flowers, green water, blue sky, sunshine, ... fragrant spring, happy spring, ... disappeared! Erased by a violent bout of coughing!

But she still wanted to struggle! She reached for the electric bell at the head of the bed, she wanted to call the room attendant and order him: "I'm coughing so badly, please go and get Doctor He for me!"

But her hand suddenly retracted. She heard a slight sound of footsteps in the corridor outside, first heavy, rhythmic rubber-soled shoes, then slow, hesitant high-heeled shoes walking on tiptoes. After the two sounds stopped at one spot, a low, quick laugh rang out:

"Darling Darling! Why do you still want to see that guy?"

"Don't be jealous! I pity him, I don't love him, rest assured!"

"Then I must also ask you not to be jealous!"

"What? ..."

"What pretense! Haven't you always been wary of that beautiful female patient? Let me tell you, I'm so afraid her lung disease will get worse day by day, even if it were a celestial maiden descending, I wouldn't dare to get near her! You can set your mind at ease!"

The conversation was not finished, the laughter was not finished. But Xiuzhen couldn't listen anymore!

Pressing her aching chest, cold sweat and cold tears dripped onto the pillow at the same time.

"Spring is theirs! Spring has no part with me!" Sadly, desperately, she sobbed. She didn't want to see that patch of deathly white, she closed her eyes, sobbing so hard that her whole body trembled.

She cried too sadly. Someone gently turned open her door, she didn't know. Someone walked up to her bed, she didn't know. It wasn't until someone softly called "Miss Wang" that she opened her eyes.

Opening her eyes, she was so surprised that she almost cried out. A small, bright red rose appeared before her! An old room attendant smiled at her with a wide mouth.

"What's going on?" She wiped the tears from the corners of her eyes and asked strangely.

"Miss Wang! Why are you sad? Look! Mr. Shen next door sent you such a beautiful pot of flowers!"

"Mr. Shen next door?" Her heart began to beat a little.

"Yes, Mr. Shen has the same disease as you. And like you, he is often sad. Just now, when he asked me to move this pot of flowers out, his face was also full of tears..."

The room attendant chattered on, but Xiuzhen was lost in thought. She suddenly asked: "How old is Mr. Shen? Is he handsome?"

"Mr. Shen is very young, at most twenty-five years old. Very handsome! It's just a pity that he's sick!"

The room attendant went out. Xiuzhen stared at the red flower. She suspected that she was dreaming again and tried her best to open her eyes wide, to open them wide. …

Not a dream! Indeed, there was a bright red flower in her deathly still room!

Gradually, tears flowed from the corners of her eyes again. But these were not tears of despair and pain, but tears of joy and realization.

After taking her medicine and drinking her milk, she tried her best to support herself and took out a piece of letter paper printed with honey-yellow delicate patterns from a drawer in a small table by the bed. She lay on the pillow and wrote these few sentences:

"Mr. Shen:

Thank you for giving me this red rose! It's so beautiful! It brought back the spring I lost and gave me a new life! But I still don't know your name, can you tell me? Wang Xiuzhen."

She folded the letter paper with excited trembling fingers, handed it to the room attendant to send it to the next door, and waited for a reply with excited trembling feelings.

The reply came indeed. It was a light blue Western-style envelope, inside was a light blue letterhead, on which was written:

"Miss Xiuzhen:

You thank me, but I want to thank God! Don't laugh at me, I'm kissing your letterhead. Because those honey-yellow little flowers on your letterhead are exactly what I wanted to find." My spring is back, and my life is back! Now I tell you, my name is Jian Guang, I hope you don't forget...

A year passed

Still a happy spring, the spring of young people.

Fragrant, passionate, everywhere there is light, everywhere there is fragrance, everywhere there is sweet singing and the soaring of wedding marches. …

The beautiful Miss Li Ying and the handsome Doctor He got married!

In the hall of a large hotel. The bride wore a silver dress, and the groom wore a scarlet carnation. Surrounded by flowers, they held hands, smiling proudly, smiling mysteriously, forgetting everything! … But, –

In the same spring, on a lonely wasteland in the suburbs, two new white stone graves were added. In front of one grave was a red rose, and in front of one grave was a honey-yellow canna. Although no one appreciated them, they were blooming quietly.

### Countryside Night Rain

— Cun

Rapid, scattered raindrops

Arbitrarily trample on the roof tiles

A puff of smoke connects to the remaining embers of a dream

On my pillow, therefore, are

Collapsing mountain floods

Surging ocean waves

Magnificent rivers

Rushing streams

A flash of white light from the crack in the floorboards

The footsteps and joyful soliloquy of my wife downstairs

"The water tank is full"

Like the previous two nights

My mother also got up like this

### Someone from Xinjiang –

— Zhang Che

Someone from Xinjiang brought me

Headscarves and dried apricots

Hami melons and raisins

Golden dried apricots

Have the color of stars

Chewing on dried apricots

In the heated warm room

Is like chewing on sunshine

On the hot "Gobi Desert" of Xinjiang

Just like finding

Clear, fragrant spring water

In the desert

We also cut open the Hami melon

The melon reflects

The blue light of people's eyes

Even the yellow-green mottled melon rind

Also has

The smoothness of a water snake's skin

In the green grass by the spring

Sprinkle a handful of raisins on

The unfolded headscarf

Like the starry

Good night in the desert

And when a girl grabs them

Letting the raisins sparkle between her pearly teeth

The headscarf wraps around her pink neck

Her smile being highlighted

Is the bright moon of the desert night

### Brief

— Yang Mou

Hearing news about you from afar, my heart is always filled with a restlessness, a worry. Fragile nerves keep conjuring up ominous premonitions. It seems I hear someone groaning for life, someone laughing wildly and ferociously.

I wish I lived in the enemy's country, filled with combat, filled with vitality, and how could I want to live a quiet life like a monk in the deep mountains? But, those clumsy, despicable sword skills, I'm almost too lazy to parry anymore. I never want these despicable people to be my friends, but these people seem to lack something even as enemies, lacking some of life's treasures – integrity and uprightness.

I love life, I hate life. As you said, "Being human is difficult." I want to add one more meaning: It is easy to be a floating, sinking person; it is very difficult to be a person who controls oneself.

It is far more difficult to walk on a broad road than to walk on a narrow, winding path. I'm not afraid of ridicule, I'm not afraid of loneliness. The road is so long, I fear I will always stop in my tracks. I want to rest tiredly.

Do you want to laugh at me? Scold me? Anyway, as you wish, you probably know these tastes too. Remember, in the past, when someone said, "They want to do that," we immediately replied, "We must do this." Tell me, is it still so firm now? I hope you are still so young and answer loudly: "Yes."

### Double Flying (48)

— Zhao Qingge

Eleven

The day after Mrs. Mo left, Baoling went to the medicinal herb shop. To show that he was a man of ambition, even though Mo Sheng told him that Mrs. Mo had left him a way out, that the house had not been sold, and advised him not to leave home for the time being and to wait until the house was rented out, he insisted on not doing so. He was grateful for Mrs. Mo's thoughtfulness, but this gratitude could not offset his melancholy. He was determined to live independently from now on. He thought that now was the time for him to truly start walking, and no matter how bumpy the road was, he had to take this first step steadily and upright! He was not afraid of falling, and if he fell, he would get up and walk again. In short, he was determined to walk on, fearless of dangers and difficulties, until he was old and dead. He did not intend to rest, nor did he want anyone to help him!

The name of this medicinal herb shop was Huichuntang. The owner, Liao Dafu, was from Sichuan and knew a little about medicine. In his early years, he specialized in purchasing medicinal herbs in the Sichuan-Yunnan area and selling them to various parts of Hubei. Gradually, he earned some money and opened a medicinal herb shop in Jingzhou. His luck wasn't bad, and in a dozen years, he had expanded from one shop to three. The medicinal herbs were complete, and the goods were genuine and authentic, making it one of the leading medicinal herb shops in Jingzhou. Since Liao Dafu went to Sichuan six years ago to purchase medicinal herbs, he happened to find that his first wife had died in his hometown. So he took his six-year-old son and left his hometown, never to return. Because his son needed someone to raise him, he remarried in Jingzhou to the daughter of a butcher. Perhaps because she had seen too much slaughtering, this butcher's daughter took bleeding as commonplace as urinating! Her temperament was inevitably influenced by the executioner, as if cruelty was instinct! She had a face full of horizontal flesh and was as fat as a pig, a pig waiting to be slaughtered! Liao Dafu, on the other hand, was a kind man. On the contrary, perhaps he had been in the business of medicinal herbs for too long, and he took saving people as important as eating his own meals! In addition, he had been influenced by a little medicine, and kindness was his nature! Although he owned a large number of medicinal herbs and also knew a little medicine, he was as thin as a sick man, a sick man who had been with the pharmacy for many years! In fact, he was stronger than anyone! A man in his forties, running a hundred or so miles a day was nothing to him.

After the proprietress married Liao Dafu, she gave birth to a fat boy in the second year. Now he was five years old. Liao Dafu named his eldest son Liao Dong and his second son Liao Liang, meaning that his two sons were the pillars of his family.

Liao Dong was already twelve years old, and fortunately, he had not been slaughtered by his butcher-type stepmother. Although he had inevitably suffered some physical hardship, he had not reached the point of bleeding. There were occasionally a few purple whip marks on his back. Liao Dafu had authentic Yunnan "Baiyao," and applying a bottle of it would relieve pain and reduce swelling. In order to reduce the chances of friction between his wife and son, Liao Dafu sent Liao Dong to school. Now Liao Dong had graduated from elementary school. According to the proprietress, she would not let him continue, because going to school cost money, and he could stay in the shop to keep accounts. Coincidentally, the bookkeeper had left a few days ago, so this would save the expense of hiring a bookkeeper. But Liao Dafu disagreed. Liao Dafu decided to nurture Liao Dong until he graduated from middle school, and then he would let him take over his shop management. It seemed too early to let him keep accounts at the moment. So Liao Dong had to continue studying, and Liao Dafu hired Baoling to be the bookkeeper. Although the proprietress was not happy in her heart, there was nothing she could do.

Please look at these few photographs. The disasters in various regions are so severe that they have reached a critical point.

Millions upon millions of heroic soldiers have sacrificed their lives on the battlefield, and the most beautiful cities in the world have been turned into rubble. Finally, the forces of justice have shattered the delusions of the fascist madmen.

Humanity has once again achieved a victory. However, what follows is an even more terrifying and dreadful enemy—famine and poverty!

China has reached a time of unprecedented hardship. In Hunan, in Guangxi, in Henan... our compatriots are eating grass, bark, and dirt! The old and the weak often take a few steps, fall to the ground, and die. This is not the first time our country has encountered famine, but it is probably the most widespread famine in our history. The disaster areas are so vast, and the number of victims so numerous. Moreover, it is happening after a great war, which will inevitably lead to the spread of terrible plagues!

The relief provided by the United National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) is so meager! When the heads of the UNRRA branch offices in various regions return to Shanghai to report, not one of them is not frazzled and struggling to cope due to the lack of relief supplies. According to the May 27th issue of the American "Time" magazine, UNRRA's Director-General La Guardia was also furious at the slow progress of the China branch's work. Indeed, we are sincerely grateful for the assistance from our friendly nations; however, distant water cannot quench a fire nearby. By the time one meeting after another has been held and one official document after another has been circulated, our suffering compatriots will have already starved to death!

Please look at these few photographs. Please look at these helpless children! This old woman lying on the ground! Thirty million compatriots are living this kind of life, enduring, enduring, waiting for your help!

Don't just wait for foreign relief! Shouldn't we Chinese people ourselves do our part first? Are we just going to watch our own people starve to death?

Some suffering compatriots have traveled thousands of miles, wandering to Shanghai. Shanghai has tall buildings, and Shanghai is crowded with people wanting to eat. However, the Suzhou Creek divides Shanghai into two completely different worlds. Henan is crowded with people, and in Hebei, empty houses are still sealed up. Rice prices are soaring, factories are closing, and Shanghai is not a paradise!

Of course, "born in sorrow, die in ease," sorrow can make us especially aware and work harder. However, looking at the widespread desolation, it seems that we should not remain silent and inactive.
