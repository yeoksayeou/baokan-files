[Central News Agency, City News] The Chairman's visit to Shanghai is now on its fourth day, and the citizens' love, protection, and enthusiastic emotions are increasingly evident. National flags fly throughout the city, and all conversations and news on the streets and in the alleys are about the Chairman's life achievements and the grand occasion of this visit. The Chairman is extremely concerned about Shanghai's commodity prices, especially the recent soaring gold prices. He specifically summoned Councilor Xi Yushu at 10:20 yesterday morning to inquire about opinions on suppressing and stabilizing prices, as a reference for the government to stabilize prices. Mr. Xi gave the Chairman a detailed report on the fluctuations in commodity prices in the city and the previous proposed plans, and he left after about fifteen minutes. The Chairman originally scheduled to summon all officers above the rank of regimental commander in the Shanghai garrison and all officers above the rank of branch director in the municipal police bureau at 11:00 yesterday morning for a lecture. However, this was temporarily canceled because all military and police officers were preparing to attend the welcome rally at 3:00 in the afternoon and had to be responsible for maintaining order at the rally. At 11:10, the Chairman and his wife went for a walk in the suburbs by car and returned to the official residence at 1:05 pm. At 3:00 pm, he attended the welcome rally. Whenever the Chairman and his wife's car passed, cheers resounded through the sky. After the Chairman finished speaking at the rally at 3:25, he returned directly to his official residence.

### Two Hundred Thousand Citizens Burst with Enthusiasm, Welcome Rally Unprecedented, Chairman and Wife Personally Attend and Deliver Earnest Instructions

[Central News Agency, City News] Five million citizens of Shanghai held an unprecedented grand welcome rally at the Racecourse yesterday to welcome Chairman Chiang's first visit to Shanghai after the victory. The weather was clear and sunny, adding to the enthusiastic atmosphere. Yesterday's grand event was unprecedented in Shanghai. The citizens, out of respect and gratitude for the Chairman's great achievements, looked forward to seeing the demeanor of the generation's great man, whom they had not seen for eight years and who was always on their minds. Therefore, all districts of the city were deserted, especially the Nanjing Road area, which was packed with people and traffic was blocked. Cheers and firecrackers blended together, creating an unprecedentedly enthusiastic situation. The rally venue was largely set up the night before, simple, solemn, and beautiful. More than two hundred organizations participated in the rally, divided by their nature into six categories: vocational trade unions, industrial trade unions, trade associations, special associations, freelance professional groups, and party and government agencies, plus students and freely participating civilians, totaling over two hundred thousand people. Around 1:00 pm, the participating organizations began to line up and enter the venue in an orderly manner, each occupying its designated position. With such a large number of participants and such a grand scene, the order was remarkably good, setting a precedent for the city. The Chairman and his wife, accompanied by aides and Mayor Qian, arrived at the venue at 3:00 pm. Millions of citizens were overjoyed to see the demeanor of the Chairman and his wife and were deeply moved by the Chairman's earnest instructions. Therefore, after each segment of the Chairman's speech, they responded with enthusiastic applause and cheers. The rally began at 3:00 pm and ended at approximately 3:25 pm. When the Chairman and his wife left the venue and stepped down from the podium, they seemed reluctant to leave the crowd and hesitated to depart. They continued to wave and nod, and the freely participating civilians and a large number of allies crowded forward. Although the military and police tried their best to maintain order, they could not stop the enthusiasm of the masses who loved and admired their leader. The Chairman and his wife left the venue in this moving scene and returned to their official residence by car. Details are recorded below:

Chairman and Wife Go to the Rally

Around 2:30 pm, Jia'er Road and Hengshan Road were lined with military and police, with strict security. Major General Shen Wanqian, commander of the 23rd Gendarmerie Regiment, personally commanded the operation. Tens of thousands of civilians stood on both sides of the road, all wanting to see the demeanor of the Chairman and his wife. At 2:51 pm, the military and police escort vehicle on Hengshan Road was ready to depart. Soon, the Chairman and his wife's special car, followed by Mayor Qian's car and two guard cars, drove out of the official residence. At that time, tens of thousands of civilians on the side of the road responded with enthusiastic cheers to show their respect and welcome to the supreme leader. Seeing the enthusiastic emotions of the civilians, the Chairman and his wife continuously waved from the car and frequently nodded in acknowledgment. After the car passed Linsen West Road, it turned into Changshu Road. The Boy Scout band standing by the roadside began to play music to pay tribute. The Chairman and his wife's special car then passed through Changshu Road and West Zhongzheng Road, turning into Chenghaiwei Road. The crowds on the side of the road were even more crowded, and the cheers and firecrackers were even more enthusiastic. The band also continued to play music, creating the most enthusiastic symphony. At 3:00 pm, the Chairman and his wife's special car arrived at the Racecourse venue on Huangpi Road. The wife got out of the car first, and then Mayor Qian accompanied the Chairman and his wife into the venue, amidst the melodious music and the resounding firecrackers, and ascended the podium to receive the enthusiastic welcome of two hundred thousand citizens.

Extremely Solemn and Beautiful Arrangement

The rally podium was set up at the Racecourse. Huge national flags of the Kuomintang were hung on both sides of the grandstand, and a large white cloth banner about three or four zhang long was hung above, with the twelve large characters "Shanghai All Circles Welcome Chairman's Visit to Shanghai Rally" written on it, visible from afar. In the center of the podium, the national flag of the Kuomintang and a portrait of the Founding Father were hung high. On the right end of the stone steps below the podium was the civil official seating area. Several hundred people, including the top party and government leaders of the city and celebrities from all walks of life, such as Qian Dajun, He Dekui, Peng Xuepei, Wu Shaopeng, Shen Shihua, Xuan Tiewu, and Zhao Zengjue, stood on the stone steps of the civil official seating area.

In the diplomatic corps were dozens of people, including the ambassadors of the Allied countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, and Chen Guolian, director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In the center of the podium was a brown lectern, with four leather chairs placed behind it. The table was surrounded by potted plants and flowers, and several sound amplifiers were pre-installed. There were three stone steps in front of the table, and the railings on both sides of the middle stone steps were covered with long strips of red, white, and blue cloth. Flowers blossomed under the railings. Stepping down, the press seating area was on the right, and the orchestra seating area was on the left. The entire layout of the venue was solemn and beautiful.

Chairman Frequently Waved

The Racecourse, which was used for horse racing in the past, was vibrated by the cheers of 200,000 people at noon yesterday because all circles in Shanghai were welcoming Chairman Chiang's visit. After 12:00 noon, the organizations and groups participating in the welcome rally lined up and entered the venue one after another. At 2:00 pm, this usually quiet large square was already packed with people. The national flags of the Kuomintang and the horizontal banners with the names of the organizations and institutions prepared by each group fluttered in the breeze under the clear sky and white sun. Tens of millions of civilians outside the venue scrambled to see the demeanor of the Chairman and his wife, blocking the road. Yesterday, all the American and Chinese military police were dispatched, and the reporters inside the venue were very busy. At 2:30 pm, General Wedemeyer, Admiral Cooke, General Chennault, General Brink, and others arrived one after another and waited for the Chairman on the stage with the leaders. At 3:00 pm, the Chairman and his wife, admired by the world, arrived on time, accompanied by Mayor Qian Dajun, and applause thundered immediately. This was an unprecedented scene since the Anti-Japanese War. Chairman Chiang, who had worked hard and made great contributions, immediately waved frequently to the crowd below the stage, who were cheering wildly, and then slowly ascended the stage with his wife, nodding frequently to the crowd. The wife wore a brown sea tiger velvet coat and a red scarf, maintaining a kind smile throughout. The Chairman then delivered a speech to the entire audience lasting 22 minutes. (The original text is in another article.) During the Chairman's speech, the entire audience applauded enthusiastically several times. After the Chairman finished speaking, the applause lasted for several minutes. Finally, the Chairman thanked General Wedemeyer, who was standing on his right, Admiral Cooke, who was on his wife's left, and General Chennault, and expressed his gratitude to the citizens of the city. Then, all the citizens jointly cheered "Long Live Chairman Chiang," "Long Live the Republic of China," and "Long, long live." The ceremony was completed at 3:25 pm. The Chairman and his wife were immediately accompanied by aides out of the Racecourse, and the welcoming civilians dispersed after a long time. Yesterday's grand event in the Racecourse was only seen since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, bringing great excitement to the people of Shanghai. Many Chinese and foreigners who had never seen Chairman Chiang said, "We have finally seen Chairman Chiang and his wife."

###慰勞盟軍游藝會　昨晚假美琪大戲院舉行　主席夫婦兩度親臨觀劇
慰劳盟军游艺会 昨晚假美琪大戏院举行 主席夫妇两度亲临观剧

[This Newspaper News] The Chairman and his wife held a variety show to comfort the Allied forces at the Majestic Theatre last night, with Kunqu Opera and Peking Opera performed by Mei Lanfang, Zhang Eyun, and others. The program was extremely exciting. Before 8:00 pm, the invited guests had arrived one after another. Flying Tiger General Chennault, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Army in China, Lieutenant General Wedemeyer, senior military officers of the Allied nations, and many social celebrities also attended. At 8:40 pm, the Chairman and his wife arrived, and the military band played loudly. Everyone stood at attention. The Chairman took off his hat, smiled, and frequently nodded to the cheering crowd. The wife wore a black veil with gold trim on her hair, a black velvet long cheongsam, a black woolen coat, and black satin leather shoes, and also smiled and nodded to the crowd, going straight to the third row seats in the middle of the upper deck, which were pre-arranged with embroidered soft cushions. Admiral Cooke was on the Chairman's right, and General Wedemeyer was on the wife's left. There was an empty seat between the Chairman and his wife, with a small table in the middle, covered with a white cloth, with two cups of boiled water and a bouquet of fresh flowers on it. The two rows in front of these five seats were not occupied to avoid obstructing the view. After the embroidered curtain opened, the Chairman immediately took out his white-rimmed glasses from his pocket and put them on, watching the play with a smile. During the intermission, he talked and laughed with Admiral Cooke and General Wedemeyer. Mei Lanfang's "Stabbing at the Home" was originally the finale, but due to time constraints, it was switched with the third play, "Battle of Changsha," and performed first. After the Chairman finished watching "Stabbing at the Home," he left with his wife at 11:05 pm. Everyone stood up to see them off. The Chairman instructed those around him to ask everyone to return to their seats. He then left the seat with his wife, Admiral Cooke, and General Wedemeyer. When the play was about to end at 11:40 pm, the Chairman returned with his wife, and the actors were greatly excited. The performance ended at around 12:00 am.

### Full Text of the Chairman's Speech: Restore Inherent Morality, Practice New Life, Safeguard Sovereignty, Maintain Freedom and Independence

Chairman Chiang and his wife attended the full citizen welcome rally yesterday and delivered the following speech amidst the cheers of the crowd: Dear compatriots,

Shanghai is Chiang Kai-shek's hometown. Chiang Kai-shek has been away from his hometown for more than nine years. During these nine years, Shanghai was occupied by the enemy for a full eight years. The men, women, old, and young of Shanghai have suffered the enemy's slaughter and trampling, and have lived a dark and sunless life. Chiang Kai-shek has been thinking of them all the time. Today, after the victory, Chiang Kai-shek has returned to Shanghai and met with all of you compatriots at the Racecourse. I have unlimited feelings in my heart. The compatriots who have come to the meeting today, the older ones are Chiang Kai-shek's fathers and brothers, and the younger ones are Chiang Kai-shek's sons and daughters. Now, when I meet with my fathers, brothers, sons, daughters, sisters-in-law, and sisters, I feel like a family reunion, so I want to offer a few clumsy words from my heart. I hope that all of you compatriots will keep them in mind at all times and work together.

As everyone knows, eight years ago, it would have been impossible to hold a meeting in the Racecourse like we are today. Why can everyone now hold a meeting here freely? Why can I meet with everyone in this place today? This is because the spirit of our compatriots throughout the country in the arduous War of Resistance for eight years has aroused the respect of the Allied nations, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, France, and other friendly nations for our military and civilians, and has won the sympathy of the Allied nations. Therefore, the unequal treaties have been abolished, and all the concessions in various places have been recovered. The status of our Republic of China has also gained independence and freedom. However, everyone must know that although the concessions have been recovered and the unequal treaties have been abolished, how can we maintain national sovereignty in the future, and how can we maintain the freedom and independence we have gained? This task of safeguarding and maintaining is more difficult and more arduous than the work of fighting for freedom and independence in the past eight years. In the future, to guarantee national independence and the freedom of the people, we must all strive to practice it. Chiang Kai-shek personally will certainly set an example to advocate for all of you compatriots.

We must be more determined and work harder than during the War of Resistance. After another eight years, we can truly guarantee the foundation of this independence and freedom. Since Dr. Sun Yat-sen led the National Revolution, the Chinese Kuomintang has fought together with our compatriots throughout the country for more than fifty years. Today, it has achieved its goal of national independence and freedom, and Chiang Kai-shek personally has not failed the expectations of our compatriots. However, in the future, the responsibility of guaranteeing national independence and freedom lies on the shoulders of all of you compatriots. Therefore, what I want to remind my compatriots today is that the responsibility of establishing a country and guaranteeing independence in the future must be borne by everyone together.

But how can we guarantee the sovereign independence and freedom of our country, so that we will never lose it again? How can we be worthy of being a free and independent citizen? Regarding this point, I want to specifically point out today, which is what I said at the beginning, that I want everyone to keep in mind at all times and strive to practice the following words: I believe that the most important thing for building the country and guaranteeing independent freedom in the future is to restore China's inherent morality, promote our new spirit of building the country, and practice our new life, to change the numb and sluggish atmosphere. Every one of our compatriots must be enlightened to propriety, righteousness, integrity and honor, be responsible, and abide by discipline. Now, the reason why our Allied nations, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, France, and other countries can become so powerful is entirely because their general citizens have high morals and can automatically take responsibility and abide by discipline for the country, can be selfless, and can forget their families for the country. If we want to stand on an equal footing with all the Allied nations in independence and freedom, we must be as patriotic as they are, as united as they are, as moral as they are, and as spiritual as they are, and we must be able to endure hardship and work hard even more than they are. Therefore, we must not only learn their scientific and material civilization, but also learn their moral spirit. We must be able to love ourselves in all places and respect ourselves at all times. Only in this way can we be worthy of being their independent, free, and equal allies, and can we stand in the modern national and social forest. Therefore, if we want to improve the country's status and consolidate the foundation of independence now, we must first improve the morality of our citizens. If we have a foundation for building the country in spirit, and then catch up with and supplement it with modern scientific intelligence, then our work of building the country can progress by leaps and bounds, and our Republic of China can always ensure freedom and independence in the world.

Compatriots, there are many things I want to say to you today, but the main ones are only the last four sentences, which are "be enlightened to propriety, righteousness, integrity and honor, be responsible, and abide by discipline." These four sentences are the basic conditions for us to be a modern citizen. I hope that all the Shanghai compatriots can put them into practice and be a model for the compatriots throughout the country, and work together to complete our mission of building the country.

Counting accompanying staff, the total exceeds four hundred people.

Each meal is reportedly worth one thousand two hundred yuan. During the conference, special buses will provide scheduled transportation for attendees.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 14th] The agenda for the Demobilization and Reorganization Conference has reportedly been drafted. On the first morning, an opening ceremony will be held, with attendees respectfully listening to the Chairman's instructions. The Chairman may also lead all attendees in a visit to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. In the afternoon, Commander-in-Chief He and various departments of the headquarters will deliver reports.

All participating generals are expected to return to their defense areas before the 20th.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 14th] Generals, who have fought hard for eight years without removing their armor, have been summoned to Nanjing to attend the conference, immediately filling the city with a bright atmosphere. Today, reporters met several senior generals, who all expressed their sincere hope for the smooth completion of the demobilization and reorganization work in a frank and cheerful tone. China has clearly entered a new era that is extremely exciting, as can be seen from the light smiles on the faces of the generals attending the conference and the firm and resolute spirit revealed in their conversations. They are all happy to meet with news reporters, but when reporters asked about their thoughts on "news from the defense areas," they all replied in unison, "National affairs should be subject to the government's orders," and "How to complete the demobilization and reorganization should also be subject to the government's orders." Nanjing reporters generally believe that this is a symbol of progress.

[Our Hankou Correspondent, 14th] The Demobilization and Reorganization Conference is about to open in Nanjing. Military leaders who have come to Hankou in recent days include Liang Huasheng, Deputy Commander of the Northeast Security Command; Qu Shounian, Deputy Commander of the Sixth Pacification Zone; and Liu Jiming, Commander of the 75th Army.

### A Colorful Record of Welcoming the Chairman

Since the arrival of the American troops in Shanghai, the American flag had been hanging on the clock of the Racecourse. Yesterday, for the first time, it was replaced with a brand-new flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth Republic of China, hoisted high, fully expressing the warm welcome of our city's residents to Chairman Chiang!

Before the meeting, a certain organization released a red hydrogen balloon with the national flag and slogan hanging below it. It slowly rose in the venue, symbolizing the gradual improvement of the motherland's status and the people's livelihood.

When Chairman Chiang delivered his speech, he earnestly told the citizens to "understand propriety, know shame, be responsible, and observe discipline." This echoed the neon sign "Propriety, Justice, Integrity, Shame" on the roof of the Cathay Hotel. Mayor Qian and Deputy Commander Li smiled at each other upon seeing this.

Chairman Chiang was radiant, his voice was loud, and his gaze was sharp. A friend exclaimed, "Not even a trace of his sixty years can be found on the Chairman!"

A worker from a certain yarn factory said to others upon leaving the venue, "I stood for three hours and gloriously saw the Chairman's two waving white gloves." He was very pleased and overjoyed!

A child standing next to the reporter said, looking at the Chairman's constantly waving hand and frequently bowing head, "Chairman Chiang is so amiable and so cute. He is smiling at me!"

The grandstand of the Racecourse will forever be a historic landmark. Although Chairman Chiang has left, the people still linger at the platform, considering it an honor to step onto the platform and stay for a moment on the spot where the Chairman stood.

### First Session of the UN General Assembly Concludes; Security Council Rejects Investigation of the East Indies Case; Yesterday's Discussion of Syria and Lebanon's Request for Troop Withdrawal

[Our Dispatch] London, 14th (Broadcast) The United Nations will conclude its first General Assembly tonight, with a speech by British Prime Minister Attlee. The Assembly convened on January 10 and has lasted five weeks. Prime Minister Attlee also delivered a speech at the opening.

[Our Dispatch] London, 14th (Broadcast) The Security Council will convene a meeting at 11:00 AM tomorrow (7:00 PM Shanghai time) to discuss another dispute between United Nations members. Syria and Lebanon are expected to strongly demand the simultaneous and complete withdrawal of British and French troops from the Levant (i.e., the Syria-Lebanon region). The Security Council has so far dealt with four disputes between nations. It first discussed the Iranian issue, then encountered the Greek and Indonesian issues, and tomorrow it will discuss the appeals from Lebanon and Syria.

[Our Dispatch] London, 14th (Broadcast) Today, the Speaker of the Syrian Parliament, Al-Khouri, and the Chief Representative of Lebanon, Frangieh, were officially permitted to attend the Security Council meeting. A fierce debate ensued for ninety minutes, centering on whether the complaints filed by the two countries should be regarded as a "dispute" or a "situation," but no decision was made. After the Security Council adjourned today, there was also a heated debate in the lounge. It is reported that Egypt, as a member of the Arab League, fully supported the complaints of Lebanon and Syria and tried to prevent Britain and France from using their veto power to prevent the Security Council from handling the case.

(Reuters, London, 14th) The United Nations General Assembly is working overtime to complete everything within the week.

[United Press, London, 13th] The explosive East Indies issue was extinguished today when the United Nations Security Council rejected a proposal by the Soviet Union and Ukraine to send a five-nation investigating team to the East Indies.

[Reuters, London, 14th] Only eleven hours after resolving the Indonesian dispute and postponing consideration of Albania's application to join the United Nations, the Security Council met this morning to hear Syria and Lebanon demand that British and French troops withdraw from the Levant simultaneously.

[Reuters, London, 14th] US Representative Stettinius yesterday suggested in the Security Council that the case of Albania's application to join the United Nations be postponed for discussion in order to study it. Soviet Representative Vyshinsky opposed the US suggestion, arguing that Albania had contributed during the war and that the matter was not difficult. Bevin also advocated giving the Security Council sufficient time for consideration. As a result, with the approval of eight council members, the US representative's suggestion was passed.

### General Assembly Passes World Food Shortage Relief Plan; One Billion People Face Famine, Awaiting Urgent Aid

[Our Dispatch] London, 14th (Broadcast) The United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution tonight to strengthen the five powers' efforts to alleviate the world food shortage, requesting the United Nations to pay attention to future food shortages and tighten belts to cope with the difficulties.

[Another Telegram] Bevin said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly yesterday on the world food situation that countries that need to import food need a total of 17 million tons of wheat flour in the first half of this year, but only 12 million tons have been supplied. This is not the final figure, and the actual situation cannot be determined until several weeks later. It is expected that the shortfall will be more than 5 million tons. The lack of rice will cause one billion people to face famine within two months.

[Another Telegram] Food ministers and experts from all over the world will meet in London next month to mobilize international resources to cope with the world food crisis in 1946-47.

### A Step Further in Reforming the World; Colonialism Should Be Eradicated; Mandated Territories Transferred to United Nations Agencies

[United Press, London, 13th] The United Nations has taken another step forward on the long road of reforming the world, hoping that colonialism will no longer exist anywhere. Countless people know that the term colonialism is the root cause of war and suffering. A representative of a certain country at the United Nations General Assembly said that colonialism, in its historical sense, is a struggle for power and oppression of undefended people, and its eradication is the ultimate goal of the territorial independence stipulated in the United Nations Charter. There have been two major developments in this movement: apart from the Union of South Africa, all mandated countries have announced their willingness to transfer the mandated territories to United Nations agencies. As suggested by the United States and seconded by China, the United Nations Charter has stipulated that the welfare of the residents of all colonies and territories of various countries should be taken into account. Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand, and Belgium announced today that they will immediately start preparations so that trusteeship can be implemented when the United Nations General Assembly convenes in September. The mandated territories that have been announced for transfer to trusteeship include British Tanganyika, Togoland, and Cameroon (Jordan has been granted independence), French Togoland and Cameroon, Belgian Ruanda-Urundi, Australian New Guinea and Nauru, and New Zealand's Samoa. However, the Union of South Africa stated that German Southwest Africa should be incorporated into the Union of South Africa. After New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser protested, South Africa agreed to reconsider.

The above funds were allocated from the $500 million Equalization Credit loan to China approved by Congress in 1942. China had allocated $150 million from the loan by last September, leaving $15 million.

### Members of the Far Eastern Advisory Commission Return to Washington; Meeting Scheduled for Next Wednesday

[United Press, Washington, 13th] Several members of Congress and diplomats today called for Argentina to be removed from the United Nations. Others believe that such a request may be slightly inconvenient for the United States, as the United States led other countries at the San Francisco Conference to advocate allowing Argentina to join the United Nations. The Soviet Union was the most vocal opponent at the time.

### The Brain Trust of Roosevelt's New Deal: Secretary Ickes Resigns; Pauley Affair Cited as Reason for Departure

[United Press, Washington, 13th] The White House announced today that President Truman has accepted the resignation of Secretary of the Interior Ickes, effective February 15th. Before a new Interior Secretary is appointed, his duties will temporarily be assumed by Under Secretary Chapman. With Ickes' departure, only two cabinet members remain from the Roosevelt administration: Secretary of Commerce Wallace and Secretary of the Navy Forrestal, the latter of whom has also announced his intention to leave the cabinet this year. In his letter to the President, Ickes stated, "Regarding the question of truth or falsehood between Pauley and myself, since Your Excellency was not present during the investigation, and the record-keepers did not have time to read it carefully, Your Excellency, even in your position as President of the United States, cannot make a judgment on this matter. The various forces that previously ruined Fall have a constant effect on any Secretary of the Interior. The Republican Party, long before its great defeat in 1932, disintegrated during Fall's time because it was powerless to resist such political pressure."

Reportedly, Mr. Ickes is 71 years old and has served as Secretary of the Interior for 13 years, also concurrently serving as Public Works Administrator for several years. During the depression, Mr. Ickes used a construction plan worth four billion dollars to provide relief to unemployed workers, building hundreds of water gates across the country, generating a large amount of hydroelectric power to supply vast areas domestically, and laying the foundation for land reclamation projects. All factions of the Roosevelt administration considered Mr. Ickes to be the brain trust of Roosevelt's New Deal, and whenever the New Deal was attacked, Mr. Ickes was always at the forefront.

[Reuters, New York, 14th] Most major American newspapers stated in today's editorials that Ickes' resignation as Interior Secretary would have a negative impact on President Truman's government.

### MacArthur's Headquarters Orders Japanese Government to Transfer Valuables; Dissolves Steel Control Association, Forms New Committee

[United Press, Tokyo, 14th] MacArthur's Headquarters today ordered the Japanese government to hand over precious metals (coins and gold and silver bars) that have not yet been surrendered by the Japanese or other Axis governments, royalty, nationalist or terrorist societies, political organizations, Shinto religions, and other organizations and individuals, to the U.S. Eighth Army, to be stored in the vaults of the Bank of Japan in Tokyo and Osaka. Previously, according to reports from the Bank of Japan, some branches of the bank still held un-surrendered gold and silver, so headquarters issued this order.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 14th] The Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers announced today that the Japanese government's proposal to dissolve the Steel Control Association and form a new "Steel Committee" has been approved by the Supreme Commander. The announcement stated that Japanese industrial leaders and government authorities had told Allied officials that they believed it was necessary to psychologically eliminate the "blemishes" of the "wartime industry" in Japanese industry, and that the only way to achieve this goal was to dissolve the Steel Control Association.

### A Sketch of Post-War Japanese Life: Drunken Women Wander, Nouveau Riche Splurge

[United Press, Tokyo, 14th] According to the Kyodo News Agency, six months after the end of the war, all entertainment venues in Japan are thriving, with geishas topping the income tax list. Geishas faced very difficult lives during the war due to bombing and government bans. Entertainment districts in Tokyo, such as Shinbashi, Hakusan, Asakusa, and Yoshiwara, all suffered heavy losses in air raids, but post-war repair work and the construction of temporary housing have been carried out rapidly in Tokyo and other cities to meet the needs of pleasure-seekers. According to the Asahi Shimbun, a survey in early January showed that many Japanese people, especially the tycoons of newly emerging companies, had made fortunes during the war and were therefore squandering money like water, spending as much as 5,000 yen in one night. They are giving up on themselves and spending lavishly to avoid the upcoming property valuation and wartime profit tax. For example, the cost of a meal, accompanied by whiskey and geisha songs and shamisen playing, is 5,000 yen per person. In December, Tokyo's entertainment tax revenue totaled 3 million yen, an increase of 1 million yen compared to the previous month.

### Local Dispatches

Suzhou

Preventing Epidemics: The county government believes that the rivers in Suzhou have not been dredged for a long time, resulting in the accumulation of filth everywhere. Since the beginning of last winter, there has been little rain and snow, and the river water has dried up. Tributary rivers and larger rivers are all shallow and bottomed out, and foul air is overflowing. With the warm weather in spring, there is a deep fear of an epidemic breaking out, causing no small harm. The County Construction Department has specifically formulated a plan to dredge the rivers in the city and suburbs, within the scope of the county's financial resources and manpower, and has obtained approval to implement it selectively. Yesterday, it sent personnel to various rivers in the city and suburbs to conduct investigations, so as to start construction on schedule.

### Davis Transferred: U.S. Consul General to Shanghai

[United Press, Washington, 13th] The State Department announced that President Truman has appointed Davis, the Minister to Denmark, as the Consul General to Shanghai. The current Consul General to Shanghai, George C. Q. Poe, will be transferred to Singapore as Consul General. Davis has served in the U.S. Consulate in China. President Truman recently wrote to Davis, saying that the transfer to Shanghai would allow him to do more for the country, so Davis has resigned as Minister to Denmark and taken up the position of Consul General to Shanghai. Davis's re-transfer to Shanghai as U.S. Consul General is due to the importance of Shanghai, which cannot be handled by anyone other than a capable person in the diplomatic world. Davis has served in the diplomatic world since 1917, and was the Consul General to Shanghai in 1935 and 1936.

### Labor-Capital and Government Tripartite Negotiations: The Rise and Fall of American Labor Strikes; The World is Concerned About the Final Scene of a Satisfactory Resolution

— Special Correspondent in England for This Newspaper, Zhu Jiasu, New York

I remember when I was still in England, I often chatted with foreigners in the parlors of hotels. Opening London newspapers, besides parliamentary debates, there were news of strikes everywhere. Everyone sighed and said that now that the World War was over, it was time to settle accounts, mainly between workers and capitalists. The government was also changing the capitalists' minds. The British Labour Party was thinking of "nationalizing" some large enterprises every day, so they argued fiercely. Although there was no large-scale fighting like in our country, the situation was very serious; this was an economic civil war.

Contagious Economic Civil War

Arriving in the United States, strikes were even more spectacular. The United States is a standard democratic country, and also the ultimate capitalist country that has developed to the stage of monopolistic enterprises. Labor unions are not as fragmented as in industrially backward countries. Workers have the freedom to strike, and as long as they do not violate order, no one has the right to interfere. Therefore, once labor and capital split, it is difficult to quell the situation by any other means unless both sides make concessions. Thus, American labor strikes, once they erupt, are not easily resolved. So practically speaking, even during the war, strikes never completely ceased. Now that the war is over, although the country is waiting for industrial recovery and production, and overseas are eagerly awaiting the United States' large-scale industrial reconstruction and relief, social contradictions are even more exposed. The wage income of the vast working class, although thicker than that of workers in any other country, cannot but rise up for their own interests and fight with the capitalists in order to maintain wartime living standards. At this time, the capitalists, although making a lot of money, are unwilling to relax, so labor strikes suddenly arise. Furthermore, due to the generality and contagiousness of labor strikes, they become turbulent and widespread, like a prairie fire. What else is this but a civil war?

The Labor Strike Surge Climbs to a Dangerous Peak

If we take the General Motors incident as a benchmark, this current major strike has a history of two months. General Motors is an American automobile monopoly giant, producing about 51% of the national output. Products such as Chevrolet and Buick are familiar to us Chinese. However, due to labor-capital disputes that have never been resolved since September last year, strikes began in November and have not been resolved to this day. Following this, the electrical equipment manufacturing industry, including the General Electric (GE) and Westinghouse (Westing House) companies that we are familiar with, also went on strike. Later, the meatpacking industry and telephone and telegraph also successively joined the vortex, causing problems for citizens to eat meat, and the United States and overseas telecommunications were cut off, turning it into a world-famous city, but for the fact that news agency telecommunications maintained it, it was simply turned into a desert island. And yesterday, the steel industry strike made the situation particularly worse. The number of strikers suddenly increased by 750,000 from about 900,000 (there are other minor industries that make up this number), jumping to a record of 1.6 million. Moreover, steel manufacturing is a major industry in the United States and also the economic lifeline. The suspension of steel production will also affect other industries, making it necessary to link with no work. Therefore, the impact is particularly profound. The American labor strike has once again climbed to a dangerous peak. No one can predict what the future holds. Now, based on the "New York Times" material of January 20, the reporter has compiled a brief table of American labor strikes.

Seeking Compromise, But Still Unresolved

This brief table only provides a concept, of course the process in this is not simple. For example, meat industry workers demanded an increase of one dime and seven and a half cents per hour, originally retreated from two dimes and five cents. The limit of the telegraph industry's capital side is the number proposed by the government labor department, which has been recognized by the capital side, but the labor side does not agree. Especially like the automobile industry and steel industry, later, the government temporarily set up a fact-finding committee to draft the numbers, but the capital side did not allow it, so it formed a stalemate. Let's take the steel industry as a special example: Although the strike was still the matter of zero o'clock on the morning of the 21st of last month, the dispute had been going on for a long time. From September 11 last year, the workers put forward a request for a salary increase of two dimes and five cents per hour, which the capital side refused, and said that if the government did not approve a steel price increase of seven yuan per ton, wages could not be increased. On November 28, the workers voted to strike in a ratio of five to one. On December 11, the strategic committee of the union announced that it would start on January 14. At this time, President Truman was very anxious. Without waiting for legislative procedures, he sent a fact-finding committee to investigate in order to solve the problem, and said that the government would rather approve a price increase of four yuan in order to avoid labor strikes. It was already a compromise, a bit of "drinking poison to quench thirst." However, an agreement was still difficult to obtain. Fortunately, the workers were willing to make concessions. They first agreed to postpone the strike for a week, and then accepted the figures of the fact-finding committee. But the capital side was stubborn and unyielding. After President Truman himself drafted a number of one dime and eight and a half cents, the labor side agreed, but the capital side still did not buy it. Only a small company with 5,000 workers finally agreed. However, the vast majority of workers could no longer bear it, so the full-scale strike broke out like a flood.

In this way, a large-scale national important industry strike affects areas up to three-fifths. Opening the map, only seventeen or eight states such as Iowa, Missouri, Florida, New Mexico, and Oregon do not have the shadow of workers' picket lines. In addition, labor strikes are surging everywhere, and people are noisy, and flags are all over the streets. From the government to the common people, they are all stunned by this embarrassing situation and have a feeling of not knowing what to do.

Basic Industries Adrift: Naturally, the United States urgently needs to restore production after the war. At the critical juncture of rapid transition from wartime economic needs to peacetime economy, it suddenly encountered such a nationwide labor strike surge, which is a great misfortune no matter what. Especially these steel, electrical appliances, and automobiles are the lifeline of American industry. Taking the steel industry as an example, it is distributed in 25 states across the country, employing 958,000 workers during the war, and the estimated value of finished products is 660 million. The highest output is 88 million tons, and the peacetime output is 56 million tons, accounting for two-fifths of the world's output. It is the most basic industry. General Motors and the electrical appliance industry are even more necessities for civilian daily use. Therefore, due to the strike, the new cars of 1946 cannot be produced, and the long-awaited electric refrigerators and radios, electric stoves, electric fans, and even light bulbs are all adrift. Of course, it is a loss for American foreign trade and bad news for overseas consumers. "So the strike is longer than going down, Truman is jumping but the facts are not so simple. The workers said that the cost of living has already increased by one-third, and the wartime processing and other subsidies are being cancelled, which is not enough for living. Furthermore, according to statistics from several agencies such as the US Federal Dynamic Construction Bureau, if all American workers increase their salaries by 10% to 25%, it is possible according to the current capitalists' making money, and it will not affect prices. Why don't the workers want to increase their money? In fact, the level of American workers is better, and the standard of living is already quite high. They themselves are not all "without food for the night," and they have long known the truth about the capitalists' wealth over the years, so they put forward a salary increase, which is also a great opportunity. The workers here demand that it is based on the capital side's ability to pay, not asking for a price from the sky. At the same time, they also stated that the capital side must not admit to the salary increase on the one hand and increase the price of goods on the other hand, using the old trick of "wool coming from sheep," resulting in rising prices, which is equivalent to not adding. This is their cleverness.

President's Mediation Still Ineffective: However, looking at it today, it is the capital that has arrived in the United States. I saw the huge advertisements of General Motors, saying that the company can only afford to pay, hoping that the workers will resume work quickly, otherwise they will suffer losses. It is not surprising. Later, President Truman's "Fact-Finding Committee" wanted to conduct on-site investigations to see if the company could pay the workers' demands as a basis for mediation. At this time, if the capital side was frank, it would not be happy to make the books public. However, they did not do so. On the one hand, they refused, and on the other hand, they published newspapers to ridicule the investigation. Of course, this is only President's personal administrative measure, and has not yet been passed by Congress, and has no legal effect. So President failed once. The fact-finding on the steel industry is the same result. The compromise plan drawn up was ignored by the capital side, even President's final direct number was still the same. It is said that they are afraid that the price of steel will rise and affect the general economic disorders, leading to inflation, and hindering foreign exports. The reasons are also very grand. However, there is only one conclusion: whether the capital side can really do its best to pay new wages, or must "grant" according to a certain profit standard, only the capitalists themselves know.

Telegraph Strike Normal Receiving and Sending: Labor strikes are deadlocked. Of course, it is not cheap for capitalists to make less money. However, in the past, their wallets were full, so the personal impact is the least. Of course, the workers are not all poor, but the loss of wages is a practical problem. The most affected are still the general consumers. According to statistics, due to the telegraph labor strike, New York's business has been greatly discounted, which is one example. Today, New York's subways, elevated trains, and buses and trams are all threatened by strikes, which will make New York a dead city, and everything will stop. In the meantime, the workers' position is exposed to contradictions. Are you dealing with capitalists? Or are you dealing with innocent civilians? The capitalist newspapers are all blaming the workers, and the workers' situation is indeed difficult, because it is not enough to awaken the capital side, but the direct impact only makes the third party a vast consumer group suffer. In this way, American workers have brains after all. For example, meat industry workers, they are planning to open three factories to maintain the minimum needs of the citizens, and military hospitals will still operate as usual. Although the telegraph workers are on strike, they still send and receive emergency events. American workers are worthy of admiration in these places.

Good Impression of Labor Measures

The current problem is what to do if the strike continues for a long time? Bernard once said bluntly about the strike problem: "If the labor and capital sides hold on for a long time, the workers will be the first to go hungry." Now the facts are clear. The workers are retreating step by step, but the capital side is unable to move an inch. The reason has been said above, because the impact is the deepest, it is not them, so they can wait leisurely, waiting for the workers to go hungry, and the government will jump like crazy, and there will be the best conditions to come out, and then it will naturally and effortlessly solve the problem. At this time, panic is only a loss, which is really unwise. Probably the capitalists' mood is like this. They hope that the workers will always have a day of begging for mercy, and at the same time, the congressmen will be forced to make laws to force the workers to resume work, and then the opportunity will come.

However, these two trends, in general opinion, may still not work, at least the timing is too immature. First, the workers this time have a lot of strike capital. Even if it is consumed for a long time, European and American societies have life insurance, and the workers have the backbone of the workers, and I am afraid that they will not go far and come out of this. Secondly, looking at the American union organization, its power is indeed great, especially during the strike period, united and fighting together, and the leaders of the union are also capable. The matter of this time, the negotiations are appropriate, and the measures are appropriate, and it does not give people a bad impression, and it can be predicted that their purpose can be sympathized with after all.

The Last Act is Starred by the Government: As for the attitude of the US government, it is most difficult to be unbiased, and the president and Congress bear the weight of the country, and they must be farsighted and responsive, on the one hand, to take into account the interests of labor and capital, especially important, and should pay attention to the overall economic consequences. The suggestions such as Congress enacting a ban on strike laws have been attacked by public opinion and will not be adopted. At most, it will review the past labor laws and strengthen the effectiveness of group agreements. This is a general requirement, or it may be possible. But obviously, this cannot be anything but gentle. Now there is also some torsion between Truman and Congress. The president has made many suggestions, and Congress has always been procrastinating. Truman mentioned this point in his speech at the beginning of the year. This handling of the labor strikes, such as the fact-finding system, etc., I don't know when Congress can pass it, making Truman even more troubled. Because he won the victory in the war in his hands, he is most uneasy about losing the glory in dealing with the labor strikes. He is not worried that the workers will riot, because this will not happen in the United States, but he is anxious all the time, the black shadow of inflation affecting the entire domestic and foreign economy may already be swaying in front of him, so President Roosevelt's anti-inflation case has passed, but now it is appearing around Truman. This is related to the fate of the United States after the war, and of course, it is closely related to the prestige and future of President. It is worth paying attention to how Truman deals with the capitalists. (January 2nd)

The patriotic enthusiasm of the five million citizens of Shanghai and the utmost sincerity in supporting Chairman Chiang were fully expressed in the welcome meeting held at the racecourse yesterday afternoon! The meeting was scheduled for 3 o'clock, and at lunchtime, the streets were empty as people wanted to catch a glimpse of Chairman's demeanor. Before 2 o'clock, 200,000 to 300,000 people had already entered the racecourse, and outside was still a sea of people. On the roads, in the carriages, on the roofs, and around the racecourse, there was not a single missing spot where tens of thousands of heads were not moving.

The cheers when the Chairman entered and left the arena, the thousands of people on the left side of the Chairman breaking through the fence during the speech, and the many students and workers in the back who always wanted to squeeze to the front, all revealed the countless ordinary people's admiration of Chairman's innocent and sincere spirit. It is as Mr. Yan Hui, an elder, said, the citizens of Shanghai today are like orphans seeing their parents again.

Chairman's speech to the citizens yesterday was like a conversation in the family. He tasted the familiarity of hundreds of thousands of people; he did not regard them as mere citizens, but as elders, uncles, brothers, sisters, and children, and the masses seemed to have the same feeling for Chairman. When the reporter left the arena after the meeting, he personally met an old man of 78 years old, who was almost pushed down in the crowd crowded in front and behind. Fortunately, he dodged to the side of the wall, and then panted and said to people, "What a danger! I finally saw him from afar! Chairman is energetic and still as strong as he was back then. China has hope!" Ah! What is this cry? The ordinary people simply regard Chairman as symbolizing the Republic of China! Yes, some children are not wrong, with Chairman in, China has won independence and freedom today; with

Chairman in, the Chinese people can continue to work hard to maintain China's independence and freedom. The Chinese people will never forget Chairman as long as they enjoy the happiness of independence and freedom for one day.

However, mere love and support are far from being enough for us citizens to have exhausted the battle of heaven. The country belongs to everyone, to the people; we all have a share, and we all have a responsibility. Chairman said that because of the success of countless revolutionary martyrs, because of the victory of countless soldiers and people in the War of Resistance, we were able to abolish the unequal treaties, and we were able to hold such a large meeting at the racecourse. Chairman said those words, we believe that he has endless joy, and also contains unlimited emotion. After listening, we recalled the "ten-mile foreign market" and the declaration that "Chinese and dogs are not allowed in," and we could not help but swallow a few tears in excitement! People have feelings and reason. In addition to emotional excitement, after listening to Chairman's loud call for "After winning independence and freedom, we must always preserve independence and freedom," can we still be indifferent, without using our reason to think about how we can not fail to live up to Chairman's earnest and heavy expectations?

There is an old saying in China, "It is difficult to start a business, and it is not easy to keep it." Revolution is starting a business, and construction is keeping it. The War of Resistance is starting a business; nation-building is keeping it. Abolishing unequal treaties and winning back independence and freedom is starting a business; forever preserving independence and freedom so that it will not fall into an unequal position again is keeping it. Chairman said yesterday that it is difficult to strive for independence and freedom, and it is even more difficult to preserve independence and freedom. The words are earnest and the feelings are immense. All human beings in the world are born equal; any country is originally independent and free. What's more, China, the descendants of Yan and Huang, has been civilized earlier, but why did it decline to the Qing Dynasty and become a semi-colony? Self-cutting people and cutting, self-harming people harm, has been the case since ancient times, and is even more violent today. The loss of China's former independence and freedom was caused by the Chinese people themselves! Today's independence and freedom in China is also obtained by the Chinese people's 50 years of bloody revolution and war of resistance! Yesterday's meeting at the racecourse symbolized that China has freed itself from the shackles of the semi-colony. This is not without a price, but at the cost of a huge price. As we set foot on an inch of land at the racecourse, we remember the gift of the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese Kuomintang since the Xingzhonghui Tongmenghui, and we must resolve to always protect the integrity of China's national territorial sovereignty! We will not take the current independence and freedom as the end, nor will we intend to harm or infringe on the independence and freedom of other countries, but we must, as instructed by Chairman, always preserve China's independence and freedom and prevent it from being lost again.

Chairman's speech yesterday was short, but the words were very important. He told us the history and achievements of the revolution, and he pointed out the only way to preserve independence and freedom. He said that as long as everyone can "understand etiquette, know shame, take responsibility, and abide by discipline," China's independence and freedom can be permanently preserved, and there is no need to worry about losing it again. Perhaps some people think that this is still old talk, and there is nothing wonderful, but they do not know that cloth, silk, millet, and soybeans are what people need to wear and eat every day. It is a pity that some frivolous young people, who do not understand things, do not read much, only know how to be new and strange, chasing the wind and catching shadows, and when they hear the golden words of etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and discipline, they may turn their heads and ignore them. What is the difference between this and the great talk about "non-filial piety" in the eighth and ninth years of the Republic of China, mistakenly thinking that this is the new trend? We heard that recently, a small number of students blindly echoed, asking not to read the Three Principles of the People, not to read Chairman's instructions, thinking that this is called freedom. We really don't understand: the Chinese people have unanimously recognized the Three Principles of the People as the highest standard for nation-building, so why should we encourage young people not to study it? The Chinese people have unanimously recognized that we must engage in peaceful nation-building under Chairman's leadership, so why do we despise Chairman's good words? It is clear that China was saved by the call of the Three Principles of the People, and it is clear that China's 50 years of revolution and War of Resistance have been successful due to the successive leadership of the National Father and Chairman. We really value it so much that we cannot bear to discard it like a shoe! Etiquette is a regular attitude; righteousness is proper behavior; integrity is pure distinction; shame is a real awareness. We ask ourselves: if we want to preserve independence and freedom forever, can we be irregular, improper, impure, or unrealistic? Can we find it from the opposite side of these words? As for the revolution and nation-building, it is difficult and great, which is well known. If we push and shirk each other, evade responsibility, are a mess of sand, and despise discipline, then how can we expect a mob to succeed? Everyone is talking about democracy today, and everyone is talking about freedom. Who does not love democracy and freedom? However, the spirit of democracy lies in self-responsibility to society. If you only know how to speak eloquently and do not consider the actual situation at all, then democracy will be used to build a house on the road, can you still do one thing well? The essence of freedom lies in the fact that everyone has their own rights. If only I am allowed to be free, and I do not consider the rights of others at all, then the law will be gone, the fences will be broken, and society will be a mess. Stability is still unattainable, let alone heaven?

Independence! Freedom! It's not easy to win in 50 years! How much blood, how many heads, how many lives and property were sacrificed for this independence and freedom! Under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Chiang, we resisted the war for eight years, and the light was seen again. The flower of independence and the fruit of freedom are fragrant and sweet, and passed down endlessly. We wish Chairman health, and we especially hope that the people of the country will work hard!

### Foreigners Must Also Comply: Household Census Starting Tomorrow, Four Forms Per Household Must Be Filled Accurately, Losses from the War Must Be Noted for Compensation Claims

The city will begin a comprehensive household census tomorrow. This reporter has learned the following special characteristics of this household census from the Civil Affairs authorities:

Principal and Subsidiary Households Must Both Fill Out Forms

(1) This census does not distinguish between principal and subsidiary households. Each household must accurately fill out four copies of the household form. Foreign households must also comply. (2) Names, ancestral home, age, occupation, etc., must be absolutely accurate and must not be falsely reported, so as to obtain legal protection. Age should be calculated based on actual age. In addition to filling in the name of the original city or county for the ancestral home, the current place of residence can also be filled in. (3) The level of education should be clearly stated, divided into different levels such as university, middle school, and primary school. (4) If there are servants, the servant's seal should also be affixed. Those without seals should add a fingerprint. (5) If a person has two or more residences, it should be noted which place is resided in more often and which less. (6) If there were any losses during the war, the amount of the loss can be noted in the last item of the household survey form as a basis for claiming compensation.

Answer All Questions, Do Not Be Arrogant

It is also learned that during the household census period, the Gu District Office will issue symbol badges to those carrying out the household census to facilitate identification and prevent exploitation by criminals. At the same time, citizens of this city should be absolutely kind to those carrying out the household census, answering all questions and not being arrogant or intentionally making false reports or making false reports on behalf of others. Otherwise, punishment will be imposed in accordance with the detailed rules for the implementation of the household census.

### The Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Sends a Telex Reply to Shipping Organizations

Clarifying the Actual Situation of British Vessels Transporting Goods

The Relief and Rehabilitation Administration of the Executive Yuan has sent the following telegram to various shipping organizations: To the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the China Merchant Mariners Association, the China Marine Engineers Association, the China Navigation Officers Association, the Chinese Seamen's Union, the China Pilots Association, and the China Institute of Navigation: Your telegram concerning your concern for shipping rights has been received with admiration. According to the Administration, the amount of relief and rehabilitation materials to be transported this year will be twice the total amount of pre-war international trade imports of our country. However, the ships currently navigating inland rivers have not yet reached one-third of the pre-war level. If special measures are not taken, the inland provinces, such as Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Guangxi, etc., will be unable to alleviate their post-war suffering due to the stagnation of materials. Therefore, with the approval of the Executive Yuan, British company ships are being chartered to transport relief materials. The contract stipulates a term of six months, and if notice of cancellation is given after five months, the contract will expire. The Administration's materials are transported by British ships at an 80% calculated price, and the Administration issues a certificate, and the freight is paid by the British government as a gesture of the British government assisting our country's relief and rehabilitation efforts. The masts bear the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's emblem to indicate that it is not ordinary commercial shipping, and the stern bears the British flag to indicate that the British government and people are also assisting our country's relief and rehabilitation efforts. This is the reason for the British side's request to fly the flag. The Administration has also taken into account the damage to our country's inland river navigation rights and the concern that the British side may use this as an excuse in the future. The British government was solemnly informed beforehand that this cooperative measure would not affect inland river navigation rights and should not be taken as an example, and the British side also expressed its consent. It is hoped that your associations will understand that our country's navigation rights are not being harmed, and will think of the disaster-stricken people in the interior waiting for rescue, and will be able to dispel misunderstandings and be happy to see it succeed. The Administration's concern for both shipping sovereignty and the hardships of relief efforts will also surely be understood. As for ships operated by Chinese people, the Administration is willing to charter them as much as possible. If the Administration abandons domestically available charters and employs foreign ships, it will fail our country's shipping industry, which the Administration will absolutely not do. This is reassuring. Special telegram in reply, hoping for your consideration. Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, Pu Mi Chou Yuan Seal.

### The Ministry of Social Affairs Explains: Qualifications of Candidates for People's Organizations

Regarding the issue of the qualifications of candidates for people's organizations in this city, all parties are well aware: The Ministry of Social Affairs has decided on the above-mentioned candidate qualifications: "The people's organizations belong to private law social personnel and are not public office candidates as defined in Article 15 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. Therefore, those who have served in people's organizations under the enemy's organization, if there is no behavior specified in Article 2, Paragraphs 8 and 10 of the Regulations for Handling Traitor Cases, will not be restricted by the preceding article when participating in the reorganized people's organization." This has been communicated by the city's Social Affairs Bureau to various organizations for their information.

### China Merchants Steam Navigation Company: Receives New Ships

The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company received the Liberty ship "Hai Zhong" and the Victory ship "Hai Chuan" yesterday. It is reported that the second Liberty ship has been renamed "Hai Xiao" and is scheduled to be received today. The new ships will set sail in succession. "Hai E" is scheduled to sail to the Nanyang Line next Thursday, loading commercial goods and sailing directly to Guangzhou. "Hai Xiang" is planned to sail to the Taiwan Line, but the departure date has not yet been determined. Seven Victory ships have already been received. It is reported that "Hai Dian," "Hai Qian," "Hai Gui," "Hai Ji," etc. will also be received in sequence.

American Ship Arrives in Shanghai. The American President Lines' ship "President Grant" arrived in Shanghai at noon yesterday and is temporarily docked at the Mobil Wharf.

### Commander-in-Chief Qian of the Shanghai-Woosung Garrison Command Speaks on the Jiang Gongmei Case

Qian, Commander-in-Chief of the Shanghai-Woosung Garrison Command, made the following statement yesterday regarding the trial of the Jiang Gongmei case: "The case of Jiang Gongmei, the former captain of the Shanghai Military Police, who was involved in corruption and wrongdoing, has been investigated by this command. Later, at the request of the Military Police Headquarters, it was handed back to that department for handling. Subsequently, an order was received from Chairman Chiang to be strictly handled by this command in accordance with the law. The Military Police Headquarters complied and sent Jiang Gongmei to Shanghai. In order to ensure fairness, this command requested the Army Headquarters to send personnel to organize a military court. The Army Headquarters appointed Senior Staff Officer Li Shenzhi as the presiding judge, and the First Inspection Group of Military Discipline, which was inspecting Shanghai, also appointed military judge Xu Haijing as a judge. However, the main trial authority for this case should undoubtedly belong to this command, according to Chairman Chiang's telegram order. The presiding judge Li Shenzhi made a statement in the newspaper on the tenth before the trial was concluded, and the opinions of the members attending the deliberation were not yet unanimous, so the judgment was hastily made, which is inappropriate. Before this case was submitted for approval, it was illegally announced in the newspaper that Jiang Gongmei was innocent, which is even more illegal. Now that Chairman Chiang has arrived in Shanghai, this command will submit the entire file for review and then proceed in accordance with the instructions.

### Post-War Reconstruction Transportation Actively Promoted: Passenger and Freight Transport on All Lines Increases

Recently, various transportation agencies are actively promoting the completion of post-war reconstruction transportation. The Highway Administration and the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration have jointly established post-war reconstruction transportation stations in Chongqing, Kunming, Guiyang, Tongguan, and other places. Currently, about 500 people depart from Chongqing every day. The Highway Administration has also organized railway and highway joint transportation to facilitate people returning to their hometowns. Purchase tickets are issued for the line from Chongqing, Baoji, Xi'an, Yuncheng, Luoyang, Xuzhou to Nanjing, which can be purchased with priority. It costs about 70,000 yuan per person to reach Nanjing. Business offices have been set up at the Lianglukou Social Service Center and Qingnian Road, and passengers' luggage is transported across the river on behalf of customers. However, there are not enough vehicles. It is planned to allocate vehicles from the Lend-Lease Act in India, but this has not been implemented because the British side needs to extract 60% of the transit fee. As for water transportation, the military and civilian transportation in January for the Chongqing-Taiwan, Yichang-Hankou, and Hankou-Nanjing sections totaled 15,674 people and 261,720 tons of goods, which exceeded the budget. In terms of air transportation, the total amount of transportation in the Beijing-Shanghai-Tianjin area last month was 38,649 people, and the total amount of goods, luggage, and mail was 42,973,727 kilograms, or 6,261,7120 tons. It is estimated that the amount of transportation this month will be higher than last month.

### Import and Export Commodities to be Inspected Regularly

### Ten Years of Injustice Suddenly Cleared: Yang Wendao Released from Prison Yesterday, Prisoners in Prison Warmly Welcome Him

[Our newspaper] At 11:40 yesterday morning, when all Shanghai citizens were lining up to go to the racecourse to await the Chairman's address, Yang Wendao was finally safely released from prison, and saw for the first time the new Shanghai with national flags flying all over the city.

Defeating the Japanese Bandits and Seeing the Light Again

Yesterday morning, Yang Zihan rushed to the High Court on North Zhejiang Road. As soon as the bailiff in charge of the investigation and bail stepped out of the court, he immediately greeted him and took a car to the residence of Yu Zhijing, a Cantonese gentleman who provided bail, to verify that everything was correct. At around 11 o'clock, Tang Huaiqun, Yang's defense lawyer, was already waiting for Liu Yugui, the presiding judge of the Tilanqiao Prison, to issue the release warrant. Liu happily walked with Tang to the temporary office of the High Court on Airoc Road to sign the warrant. Lawyer Tang then returned to the prison. At that time, more than a hundred prisoners in the "work injury room" were holding a warm farewell for Yang Wendao. Seeing that the release warrant had arrived, they cheered and shouted "Long live the Republic of China!" Some judges and clerks also congratulated Yang. When Yang and others stepped onto the car, a large team of Yizhong workers was marching forward outside the prison. Seeing this scene, Yang and his son were filled with emotion and could not help but shed tears. Yang repeatedly told reporters that if it were not for the Chairman's wise leadership, which finally defeated the Japanese bandits, he would have been unjustly sunk to the bottom of the sea, and would not have had the opportunity to see the light again today.

Family Reunion, Scheduled Broadcasting

At noon, Yang and others went to Room 209 of the Yangzi Hotel, which had been prepared in advance, to rest, have a haircut and shower, and change into brand new navy blue suits. At that time, news reporters and Yang's old friends came one after another. When Yang's 15-year-old son, Handa, met Yang, Yang could hardly recognize him. His heart was filled with sadness, and he was speechless with tears in his eyes. In the afternoon, Yang went to Hongmiao to burn incense, and then returned to his home on Annam Road to meet his wife. The family, who had been separated for ten years, finally reunited.

Ge Zhaoji, the host of the local seamen's radio station, was also Yang Wendao's defense lawyer ten years ago and is particularly concerned about this case. It is reported that he will collect materials in the coming days and create a special "Yang Wendao Case Special Program" on the radio station, telling the story of the case in a story-like style. Yang Wendao himself will also broadcast on the radio station to thank all sectors of society.

### Coal Supply in This City Is No Longer a Problem

According to the fuel management authorities, the fuel supply situation in this city has been very good recently, and the seriousness of the situation that formed during the war has gradually been resolved. The Fuel Committee regularly charters ten coal transportation ships to travel between Shanghai and Qinhuangdao to transport coal to Shanghai. According to the announcement, the amount of coal shipped to Shanghai last month reached more than 90,000 tons, and it is hoped that there will be a slight increase this month. It is also planned that from March, in addition to the existing consumption, there will be 100,000 tons of stock for preparation. Judging from the current number of sources, the fuel coal needed for all transportation, public utilities, and state-owned enterprises is sufficient to meet their needs.

### Film and Theater Industry Declaration: Please Reduce Entertainment Tax

The contents are as follows: The Peace and National Reconstruction Program resolved by the recent Political Consultative Conference has a clear provision that "the drama and film tax will be reduced separately," which refers to the current 30% in Chongqing, but this city has increased it to 50% at the time of the clear provision to reduce it. In addition to requesting the repeal of the newly added 20%, it is also appealed that the old 30% is still too high, and the resolution should be followed to further reduce it, so as to improve cultural standards and popularize social education.

### Frenzied Speculation: Gold at 1,610,000, US Dollars at 2,220

Yesterday, due to the suspension of gold sales by the Chongqing Central Bank and pending instructions from the Ministry of Finance, public sentiment was further agitated. Speculators believed that the authorities' policies were undergoing fundamental changes. Idle funds flocked to gold, and the securities firms used almost all of their available capital, disregarding the threat of high unofficial interest rates of over 20%, and made a desperate gamble. Midday trading was remarkably brisk, reaching a new high price of 1,610,000, before gradually declining. The opening price in the morning jumped wildly to 1,590,000 amidst chaos. Later, pressured by profit-taking from the bulls, it lingered around 1,540,000 for a long time. Then, a major player suddenly made a vigorous short-covering of US dollars, causing the US dollar exchange rate to skyrocket from 2,150 yuan to 2,220 yuan (this price probably did not occur outside the securities building), which greatly stimulated the gold price, causing it to surge again to around 1,610,000. Banks sold off at high prices, and money changers also released large quantities of US dollars. The industry suspended overnight transactions. At noon, the floating long positions were unable to withstand the pressure, and the price broke through the 1,500,000 level, falling to 1,450,000 before stabilizing slightly. The noon closing price was 1,500,500, an increase of 110,000 from the previous close. In the afternoon, most firms suspended trading, but there were still underground transactions for overnight delivery, ranging from a low of 1,470,000 to 1,530,500. Finally, it still hovered outside the 1,500,000 level. There were rumors that the Chongqing listed price had been changed to 125,000, causing slight anxiety. Gold ornaments were listed at 160,000, silver at 1,600, and silver dollars at 900 yuan. Unofficial interest rates ranged from 15% to 22%.

Foreign currency US dollars initially rose to over 2,000 yuan. Buyers came in droves. The gold market skyrocketed, and the arbitrage spread widened to over 730 yuan. The arbitrage activity of the yarn and cloth firms remained strong. The price gradually increased. Later, large players squeezed the shorts, causing the price to soar to 2,220 yuan. Money changers seized the opportunity to sell off aggressively. In the afternoon, the price struggled around 2,080 yuan. As a result, it rose sharply by 160 yuan from the previous close. Hong Kong dollar continued to be strong, but it was difficult for the new currency to stand firm at the 100 yuan level. As a result, the old currency increased by 30 yuan again, and the new currency increased by 4 yuan.

### Securities Not Favored, All Down Yesterday

The government bond market was relatively dull yesterday. Speculative activity focused elsewhere. The market was initially firm but later weakened, obviously influenced by the inconvenience in the Chinese stock market. Supply exceeded demand. Type C bonds fell from 2,100 yuan to 1,800 yuan, fluctuating around 1,850 yuan at noon. As a result, Type A and B bonds each fell by 70 yuan, Type C by 90 yuan, Type D by 100 yuan, and Type E by 60 yuan.

Chinese stocks were slightly inconvenient due to external interference. Credit was extremely tight. Speculation inclined toward gold, and many people sold stocks to buy gold. Yong Yarn fell from around 2,650 yuan, Meiya from 2,080 yuan, and Jingfu from 145 yuan. The noon closing prices were all low. As a result, compared to the previous closing prices, Yong Yarn fell by 330 yuan, Meiya by 430 yuan, and the three small popular stocks, including Jingfu, fell by 3 to 9 yuan. Unpopular stocks also fell by about 5%. After the close, floating long positions were forced to sell due to tight credit. Bidding prices were further reduced.

Foreign stocks were initially brisk due to the boost from the gold market. Yisha reached 6,500 yuan, Jardine Matheson 16,500 yuan, Yeguang 3,000 yuan, British American Tobacco 8,900 yuan, Yip Beer 2,300 yuan, and Asia 1,800 yuan before supply appeared. However, as securities firms were squeezed by tight credit, selling pressure gradually increased near noon. At the same time, the gold market also declined. The noon closing prices were all low, showing a slight decline compared to the previous close.

### Cotton Yarn Soars, Cloth Follows

Yesterday, the yarn market suddenly soared. At the opening in the morning, prices rose in unison. 20-count Blue Phoenix was bid up to a new high price of 1,000,000. 42-count Blue Phoenix once reached 2,020,000, but then retreated by 60,000-70,000 due to fewer buyers. 20-count was at 940,000, and 42-count was at 1,940,000. Other brands such as Shuang Ma and Jincheng also broke through the 1,000,000 level. Overall, the price of fine yarn increased by over 200,000 for the day, and the price of coarse yarn increased by about 50,000 to 100,000.

Yesterday, the spot cotton trade became even more active, and the market continued to rise sharply. The Silk Spinning Construction Company purchased a large amount of fine velvet cotton raw materials. The Meimian Midelin brand alone accounted for as many as 800-900 pieces, all of which were raw materials for 42-count and 32-count fine velvet. In addition, there was also considerable demand for domestic cotton raw materials. Therefore, the prices of all types of cotton increased uniformly by another 2,000-3,000 yuan.

As the gold market rose in a straight line, the cloth market also shone brightly. Only small-scale traders decorated the market throughout the day. The increase was not as intense as in the yarn market. A few dyeing and weaving factories sold off futures for the next month to suppress prices. The average price in each market increased by about 2,000-3,000 yuan compared to the previous day.

### Large Quantity of American Cotton Arrives in Shanghai

The Jsaar M. Singer, an American President Lines ship, arrived in Shanghai yesterday, carrying over 34,850 pieces of cotton from the United States, and was docked at the Yangjiadu Wharf for unloading.

### Food Prices Rise Across the Board

The rice market continued to rise sharply due to the continuous increase in gold prices, which stimulated public sentiment. Both japonica and indica rice increased by over 1,000 yuan. Soybeans also increased by over 1,000 yuan. The oil market saw another surge of 3,000-4,000 yuan. Soybean cakes also followed, increasing by 200-300 yuan. Flour continued to increase by 300-400 yuan. Wheat bran increased by 100 yuan. However, raw peanuts remained stable. Cottonseed cakes were in high demand as fuel, and the price increased by 500-600 yuan.

### Factory Managed Products all Rise in Price, Artificial Silk Trade Sparse

The artificial silk market yesterday saw 120-count Tianqiao spot goods traded at 2,150,000 yuan in the morning. Warehouse receipts followed, traded at 1,380,000 yuan. Credit was extremely tight, and prices declined in the afternoon. Spot goods were quoted at 2,100,000 yuan, but there were no transactions. Warehouse receipts were at 1,080,000 yuan, with slight transactions. Factory managed products all rose by about 10%. High-grade five-tan goods were traded at 2,450,000 yuan. Silk goods Meiya quilt covers were 100,000 yuan higher per hundred than the previous day. Hongkang Dacheng Gebei crepe prices were stable, increasing by over 100 yuan per yard. Minsheng brocade was traded at 15,000 yuan per piece.

### Asphalt Prices Soar

After the red opening for asphalt, quotations from various producing areas all trended upwards. Prices in the Lanjin area had already increased to 36,000 yuan. A Hangzhou firm offered to sell Kaipujiang sharp goods for 41,000 yuan three days ago, and it was reported that the price had increased again to 43,000 yuan yesterday. Jiaxing Benche was still only 48,000 yuan the day before yesterday, but had already opened at 50,000 yuan yesterday. All were for delivery in Jiaxing Xiashi. However, freight rates were 20-30% higher than in January, so costs were even higher. Current merchants sell Benche asphalt for 58,000 yuan, Neiping for 54,000 yuan, Daganlan oil for 47,000-48,000 yuan, and Mixinchuan accounts for 1,500,000.

### Tea Prices Advance All the Way

The varieties of red and green tea have seen continuous actual sales recently. Suzhou firms are showing a tendency to accept all offers. Tianjin firms also plan to make a comeback in the coming days. However, market inventories remain thin. Therefore, holders of goods all believe that they are rare and valuable. As a result, the trend has been unusually sharp in recent days. Jasmine Ding Shuangxun has already broken through the 350,000 yuan level per dan. Top-grade Huihong Qing has also reached a new high price. Other varieties have not looked back. As for chrysanthemum, Guang firms are paying even closer attention.

### Seized Cloth Already Being Disposed Of

Cotton cloth manufacturers still have over 2 million bolts of cotton cloth that were forcibly purchased by the enemy and puppets, which were transferred by the puppet merchants' association to the enemy and puppet property disposal bureau. The three trade associations of the dyeing and weaving industry, the yarn industry, and the cotton cloth industry have repeatedly applied to various responsible agencies for the return of these goods. It is said that a written request was also submitted to Chairman Chiang during his recent visit to Shanghai. However, according to information revealed by relevant parties yesterday, the Ministry of Military Administration urgently needs to requisition 1.6 million bolts of cotton cloth. The Enemy Property Bureau will coordinate with the customs to take delivery of 600,000 bolts and plans to allocate 1 million bolts from the cloth shipped from the United States. It is said that the 600,000 bolts are the seized goods transferred by the puppet merchants' association. However, their types are all patterned goods, which may not be suitable for the Ministry of Military Administration. According to news from the above-mentioned three trade associations, President Song had previously indicated that he could resolve this matter in accordance with the law. Members are requesting the associations to seek effective relief from higher-level agencies and judicial authorities within the scope of the law as soon as possible. They hope that the government will handle this matter seriously. If the Ministry of Military Administration needs cloth, it can settle the price with the original owners and should not combine it with enemy property for requisition, causing misunderstandings among merchants and the public.

### Higher Education Statistics: Considerable Progress During the War of Resistance, Number of Universities and Colleges Reached 140

[Our Newspaper's Special Dispatch from Chongqing] During the War of Resistance, the Ministry of Education moved inland, and inland education developed considerably under the guidance of the Ministry of Education, in response to the needs of the times. Regarding the higher education sector, the overall situation of public and private universities and colleges in the country is as follows:

Pre-War Situation

According to the Ministry of Education's survey statistics for the academic year of 1936, there were 42 national, provincial, and private universities, 36 independent colleges, and 30 vocational schools, totaling 108 institutions, with 11,850 faculty and staff.

### Tung Wah's Subsidiary Team Fails in Match Against British Navy, Losing 2-1 After Initially Leading

Tung Wah organized a friendly match with the British Navy yesterday for the purpose of training its troops and giving its new players an opportunity to play. Therefore, Dai Linjing, Sun Jinshun, and others were present as spectators and did not participate in the match. The weather was very good yesterday, so the stadium was very lively even though it was a friendly match. Unfortunately, Tung Wah was unable to use its best lineup, which disappointed many fans who like to see the team win.

After the match started, the British team was new and their coordination was not yet skilled. Tung Wah worked hard, and Han Longhai opened the scoring, ending the first half at 1-0. In the second half, the British team's stamina was formidable. Tung Wah's defense was in trouble, and Lin Wenhu committed a major mistake by committing a handball. McClowden scored on the penalty, tying the game at 1-1. The British team took advantage of the momentum, and Towns achieved success, taking the lead at 2-1. Although Tung Wah had many attacks afterwards, they were unable to break through the opponent's net. Tung Wah lost to the British Navy 2-1 at the end of the match.

### Tonight's Basketball League Matches

There will be three basketball league matches tonight. In the first division, China South will face the Shantou team. In past meetings between the two teams, each has won. Their strategies are similar, so it is impossible to make a prediction before the match. It will depend on the situation at the time. In the women's division, Xuehong and Qinglian are both new and young players. The winner of today's match will avoid last place. Both teams are very young and their strength is about the same, so it will be a close match. In the second division, the Red team will face the V team. The former has just defeated Siling and is carrying its momentum. It is feared that the V team will not be able to escape defeat. The schedule for today is as follows:

Xuehong vs. Qinglian (Women's) 5:30 PM

Red Team vs. V Team (Second Division) 6:15 PM

China South vs. Shantou Team (First Division) 7:15 PM

Spring and Autumn

### Rambling Thoughts on Great Works and the Lives of Writers

— Ren Jun

"Why hasn't China produced any great works yet?" As far as I know, this question was seriously raised and discussed long before the War of Resistance.

Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, it has been repeatedly mentioned in the rear areas. Now that the War of Resistance has finally been won, this question may soon be raised again and hotly debated.

Indeed, if we acknowledge that literary works are a reflection of objective reality, then China should have, and very likely could have, produced great works long ago.

However, it seems that none have ever been produced. The fact that this question is still being raised and may continue to be discussed is the best counter-evidence. What is the reason for this?

Naturally, there may be many reasons, such as the relatively short history of China's new literary movement, writers' experiences being too narrow, and the general lack of necessary skills in expression, and even the frequent constraints imposed by certain objective conditions... etc. But the real-life environment of the writers is obviously also closely related.

How so?

We know that writing articles (engaging in literary creation), although certainly not as difficult as moving mountains and filling seas, cannot be considered as easy as sipping tea and drinking wine. Even if you have extraordinary talent, rich experience, and excellent subject matter... if you don't have relatively ample time to conceive and edit, if you don't have a relatively quiet environment (even a small, cramped room will do), if you don't have relatively full energy to allow you to constantly revise and polish... then not only will great works absolutely not be produced, but even things that are not "great," or even "small," will likely be stillborn.

But what is the living environment of the average Chinese writer like? Everyone is complaining about poverty, and many are ill! Writers and poverty are simply like a pair of passionate newlyweds, truly inseparable! In fact, the number of "professional writers" who can completely support themselves by writing is simply one or two out of ten (and their poor and miserable circumstances are beyond the imagination of outsiders!). The rest are all "amateur writers," who are painfully forced to spend most of their best time and energy in offices, classrooms, or even factories and shops to ensure that themselves and their wives and children barely escape starvation and freezing. Only then can they rack their brains, steal moments of leisure, or, after dealing with routine matters, or when utterly exhausted, force themselves to pick up their pens and write... It was like this before the war, and it's even more so after the war! Now that the War of Resistance has been won, it's hard to say what the future holds, but at least at present, there hasn't been the slightest improvement. Moreover, generally speaking, things are inevitably even worse! This is an ironclad fact that is visible to all and heard by all! There is absolutely no fabrication or rumor-mongering!

In this situation, honestly, as long as they don't become another Ye Zi, Wang Luyan, Xie Liuyi, Xiao Hong, second, third, fourth... it would already be an exceptionally rare "miracle," and it could even be said to be "lucky," so how can we talk about "great works"!

Therefore, to this day, the question, "Why hasn't China produced any great works yet?" is certainly worth raising and discussing. But before raising it, what should be mentioned even more urgently is: "How can we make it possible for Chinese writers to have a living environment in which they can produce great works?"

Moreover, I dare to assert that only after solving this fundamental problem first can we talk about other things and think about other things. Otherwise, no matter how passionately you discuss and study, great works will still be extremely far away from us! Extremely far away! Even farther than the sun is from the Earth!

You sincerely hope that your horse will run fast and well, but you are unwilling to feed it enough grass! Isn't that a little too much? Isn't it?

### The Water of the Wall River

— Ling Xing

Three out-of-towners who had traveled to Tianjin had three different impressions of the water of the Wall River when they returned. One said: The water of the Wall River is dark, black, and foul-smelling, making people cover their noses as they pass by. Another said: The water of the Wall River is like a pool of mud, and only mud masons have a good feeling about it. The third said: The water of the Wall River is incomparably clear, and the fish swimming inside can be counted. I have a common impression of these three people: they did not recognize the Wall River.

As for myself, after traveling to and from Tianjin more than twenty times over ten years, I finally fully recognized the Wall River.

The first time, I strolled across that yellow dirt road from Nankai Girls' High School, and I saw a bend of stream water. Someone told me: This is the Wall River. From that day on, I fell in love with it, I fell in love with the willows on the muddy banks, I fell in love with the clear river water, the fish in the river, and the yachts floating on the water, and even the setting sun slowly climbing over from a distance. When the setting sun climbed over, the river water rippled with reddish-golden waves, and many, many kinds of bright colors shimmered there. Therefore, every evening after dinner, I was accustomed to strolling along the Wall River at dusk. If I had one or two friends, I would rent a yacht, float to Balitai, and bring back the scales of the setting sun on the river surface. But at that time, I was still a child. Only later did I feel pity for the memories. After the war, that place was a long stretch of rubble, with guard posts for enemy soldiers, no longer a place for sightseeing. To seek dreams there, it would be better to seek them in dreams.

However, there was an opportunity to see another side of the Wall River's water. Because the war had made the concessions in Tianjin even more prosperous, it felt like this: if you were to go to Tianjin, you must go to the concessions in Tianjin. The British concession had two most famous roads. One was called London Road, which is now renamed Meiling Road. It seems that the three characters "Meiling Road" are more beautiful than "London Road." There was also Wall River Road. Later, other roads were renamed several times, and some were renamed so difficult to remember. Wall River Road was only changed to Wall River Road, and there were no more changes. The first time, it was in summer, I passed through Yaohua Bridge, and I saw the Wall River water here, just as mentioned above: so dark that it was like ink, and a strong stench rose to the bridge surface. But on the embankment, there were chrysanthemums, locust trees, and a path paved with pebbles, a pile of earth, and a small pavilion. Later, I found that even at night, people still brought palm-leaf fans and enjoyed the cool breeze by the river. Because Xuan and I had strolled along this river, I had no aversion to this dark, black river water. It often brought me back general, beautiful memories and thoughts of unrequited love.

As for the yellow mud-like Wall River water, one had to have a considerable opportunity to see it. One had to take a ship leaving Tianjin at the confluence with the Hai River, and someone pointed to the surging yellow water and said: "Look, that is also the Wall River!" One must have such a person to point it out, otherwise one would not recognize it, because it has completely changed, no longer so gentle, without chrysanthemums, willows, earth mounds, and thatched pavilions. The river water is surging, and it can no longer set off the secluded charm of the setting sun, not to mention that this is on a ship, and the general sorrow of parting often disturbs the poet so that he no longer has poetic ideas, and the traveler's sorrow is all entrusted to the distant journey.

A person skilled in embellishing words will surely decorate the water of the Wall River beautifully and lovably. Because this is a changeable river, only because it is small is it lovable, only because it is changeable can one choose according to one's preferences. If there is a beautiful and gentle memory, the Wall River will be personified and never forgotten.

It is unreliable to boast about the Wall River with words, but do not look at it with worldly eyes. A Tianjin friend boasted to me about their Wall River, saying: "The Wall River is good, the road next to it is so wide and so flat, there is nothing else like it!" Right, he is so right, but can you not have a feeling of laughing and crying? His Wall River is the asphalt road beside that pool of stinking water, and if we are talking about the water of the Wall River here, there is no water in his river.

### Flying Together (14)

— Zhao Qingge

(4)

In this day and age, one can't take things too seriously, just live one day at a time. Enjoy the wine today if you have it, smoke the cigarette today if you have it!

Master Weng is indeed like that. From a good perspective, he is very optimistic. From a bad perspective, he is not as ambitious as Master Mo. Although Master Mo is still compromising and prolonging his life, he is ultimately unwilling in his heart. A person who has complaints is a person who has ambition. Master Weng never complains. He is very content with his fate, so he has fewer worries.

While they were talking animatedly, Madam Weng the Second came in. As soon as she entered the door, she shouted:

"What are you two brothers talking about? You're drinking and chatting, really enjoying yourselves!" After saying that, she snatched the pipe from Master Weng's hand and scolded him harshly: "Smoke fiend!"

Master Mo smiled, stood up, and offered Madam Weng the Second a seat.

"I'm happy today, so I specially invited my old brother to drink celebratory wine. How about it? Why don't you have a drink too?"

"No! No! I can't drink," Madam Weng the Second said coyly, plopping down next to Master Weng.

"Brother, in a few months, I will also invite you to drink celebratory wine!"

"Is that so? Your wife is already--" Master Mo said halfway, then felt embarrassed, so he stopped quickly.

"Don't listen to this smoke fiend's words, Brother!" Madam Weng the Second pinched Master Weng quietly, both angry and shy.

"Ouch!" Master Weng couldn't help but shout. Still smiling, he said: "Brother is not an outsider, what's there to be shy about! Maybe if she gives birth to a son tomorrow, we'll have to become relatives! Brother, they're doing a 'marriage pact from the womb,' do you approve?"

Social Service

### Reader's Letter Appeals to Society to Pay Attention: Is This the Life of an Apprentice?

Hope the Authorities Thoroughly Investigate the Actual Situation and Find Ways to Improve It

Dear Editor: Your newspaper is the mouthpiece of the people, especially for the oppressed. I am deeply admiring. I was originally an apprentice in a shop, living a life like a slave. In addition to doing all the chores, I also had to cook and take care of the boss's young child, and even wash clothes. A little carelessness would lead to harsh scolding. The day before yesterday, I accidentally broke a bowl while washing dishes, and he happened to see it. Not only was I beaten and scolded, but I had to pay for it, and even my apprenticeship was suspended. Therefore, I had no choice but to pack up my bedding, thinking that if I went home, I would be blamed and looked down upon by my uncle and aunt (because I am an orphan), and mocked by the neighbors. The more I thought about it, the more bitter I felt, and tears fell like rain. But the heartless boss was not sympathetic. I think there is no apprentice in the world who is more miserable than me! Apprentices have no right to speak, let alone read books and newspapers. Because I like to read books the most, I am often beaten, just like Qin Shihuang's burning of books and burying of scholars. You think that the existence of this apprenticeship system only increases all kinds of inequalities in society, so what democracy and equality can the country talk about? I believe that there are many apprentices in society who are oppressed, and they are looking forward to liberation. I hope the government will thoroughly investigate the living conditions of apprentices. Should it exist and be improved? Today, I boldly address the most tragic appeal to people from all walks of life, and earnestly request the government authorities to lend a helping hand to improve the lives of us apprentices.
