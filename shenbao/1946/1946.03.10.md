### Northeast New Situation Undergoing Transformation: Shenyang City Fires Everywhere; Rumors of All Soviet Troops Being Transferred

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th (Urgent)] Chongqing News: The news regarding the withdrawal of a portion of Soviet troops from Shenyang, starting from the 7th, has been confirmed, but the official authorities have not yet received formal notification. According to well-informed sources here: The sudden withdrawal of Soviet troops from Shenyang on the 1st is extremely noteworthy given the Communist forces eyeing Shenyang from the outskirts. Since the authority of military mediation has not yet reached the Northeast, and the Communist forces that have transferred to the Northeast from the Jehol and Chahar provinces have clearly obtained some kind of support, they are awaiting a new opportunity. If so, then the future new situation in the Northeast will be unveiled in a hurried and chaotic manner, which is highly probable. Whether Marshall, Zhang Zhizhong, and Zhou Enlai can immediately go to the Northeast will depend on Moscow's attitude. The new situation in the Northeast is gradually transforming.

[Central News Agency Shenyang Dispatch, 9th (Urgent)] Soviet troops in the Shenyang urban area have been entirely transferred elsewhere, and our troops are currently taking over the defense. There are several fires in the urban area, and Communist forces are very active in the suburbs. Our troops are doing their best to control the city's defenses.

[United Press Beiping Dispatch, 9th] According to estimates from American reporters returning here from Shenyang, the Soviet troops in Shenyang number about six or seven thousand, commanded by Stankevich. There are at least ten thousand Nationalist troops stationed in the west of Shenyang, not far from the city, and another twenty thousand Nationalist troops. Several tens of thousands of Nationalist troops are being blocked at Xinmin and Dahushan. After Japan's surrender, the Communist army once controlled Shenyang. Recent news indicates that tens of thousands of Communist troops are still entrenched seven to ten miles from the city.

[Our Changchun Dispatch, 8th] Shenyang Dispatch, 8th (Urgent): Since yesterday, the Soviet troops here have been frequently mobilizing. Tanks, artillery, and other heavy weapons have appeared in groups in the station area. There were also fourteen heavy artillery pieces and more than thirty artillery vehicles, many teams of officers and soldiers, and large amounts of military supplies busy loading onto trains. The station was placed under martial law yesterday afternoon, and the entry and exit of pedestrians were prohibited. This has not been lifted as of this evening. General observations suggest that the Soviet troops appear to be withdrawing, but our official authorities have never received notification. Soviet troops have left the Shenyang suburbs and Tiexi district, and our troops have automatically taken over the defense. According to previous reports, the Soviet side had boasted of holding a large-scale military exercise. Whether this movement is an exercise, a withdrawal, or some other action, no one dares to say for sure. Currently, Communist troops are stationed all around Shenyang. If the Soviet troops are indeed withdrawing, then they may take advantage of the situation and enter, which is also unknown.

[Our Changchun Dispatch, 8th] After the news of the northward movement of Soviet troops in Shenyang was released, no Soviet train has been seen arriving here as of 9:00 PM this afternoon (Chongqing time). However, the Changchun Station has restricted the entry of general passengers since the 7th, but passenger trains to Shenyang continue to sell tickets as usual. Furthermore, according to information, Soviet troops in Harbin also appear to be moving, with activity occurring in both the north and south, but Changchun remains stable as before.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 8th] A report sent from Changchun for official reference states: There are various signs that the Soviet army is beginning to withdraw or preparing to withdraw. However, this statement has not yet been formally confirmed.

### US Protests to Soviets Again Over Soviet Actions in Northeast; Marshall Summoned Back to US Next Week for Consultation

[Reuters Washington Dispatch, 9th] Secretary of State Byrnes stated yesterday that the US government's second protest to the Soviet government this week regarding Soviet actions in Manchuria cannot currently be announced. The US government sent a note to the Soviet government on February 9, and the reply has just been received, so the third protest has been blocked. He does not yet know if the protest has been sent.

[US Information Service Washington Dispatch, 8th] Secretary of State Byrnes announced at a press conference today that the United States has received the Soviet Union's reply to the US note of February 9 regarding the disposition of Northeast industry. Byrnes clarified that this reply is not in response to the note he sent to the Soviet Union this week, but rather to an earlier message. [Another Dispatch] President Truman stated at a press conference today that he has asked General Marshall, the US President's Special Envoy to China, to return to Washington as soon as possible for consultation. The President said that Marshall will still return to China as a Special Envoy afterwards.

[United Press Chongqing Dispatch, 9th] The various sectors of the capital city expect that Special Envoy Marshall will depart around the 15th of this month after the closing of the Second Plenary Session and return to his country to report on his duties. The main reason President Truman recalled Special Envoy Marshall is to discuss the situation in the Northeast. According to people close to the Three-Man Committee: Committee members Marshall, Zhang Zhizhong, and Zhou Enlai are very eager to personally inspect the Northeast, but this is unlikely to happen at the moment.

[United Press this City Dispatch, 9th] United Press correspondent Minter states: At the end of the war, there were 1.6 million Japanese soldiers and civilians in the Northeast. The Soviet Union's lack of cooperation with the American plan to send these Japanese people back to their country has become another new cause of friction between the US and the Soviet Union. Given the importance of this work, US Special Envoy to China General Marshall will likely raise this issue with senior officials in Washington when he returns to the United States next week, as the completion of the repatriation work is extremely related to the American demobilization in the China theater.

### Special Committee of the International Military Tribunal Will Come to China

To Collect Evidence of Japanese War of Aggression Against China

[Central News Agency Tokyo Dispatch, 9th] The Stars and Stripes newspaper quoted US Prosecutor Keenan as saying that a special committee of the International Military Tribunal will depart for China at the end of this week to bring back evidence related to Japan's war of aggression against China and to arrange for witnesses to testify in court. Keenan also said that this committee will discuss with the Chinese government Japan's violation of treaties, undermining of legal obligations, and unauthorized invasion of China, resulting in the massacre of hundreds of thousands of Chinese people. This committee will also investigate the entire event of the Japanese army's fighting in the northeastern provinces of China, as well as the attack on the British and American gunboats on the Yangtze River in 1937. After arriving in Shanghai, this committee will stay for a while to participate in the trial of the Japanese who killed three American aviators, and will assist in the early return of Itagaki, the Japanese army commander responsible for the Nanjing Massacre, to Japan. This committee will include Xiang Zherong, the chief prosecutor of the Shanghai High Court.

### Wedemeyer Will Not Leave China For the Time Being; Declared at a Reception for Reporters Yesterday

[Our Report] General Wedemeyer, Commander of the US China Theater, held a reception for reporters at the Construction Building yesterday morning at 11:30, and spoke for one hour and forty-five minutes.

Inconvenient to Express Opinions on the Northeast Problem

Regarding the Sino-Soviet problem in the Northeast, General Wedemeyer said that this is within the scope of Marshal Marshall's mission, and he is not in a position to express any opinions. He has not heard of the dispatch of a mediation execution team to the Northeast. But he knows for sure that Marshal Marshall is not going, and is scheduled to leave for the United States on the 12th of this month. Whether his mission will be taken over by General Wedemeyer during his absence has not yet been specified. A reporter asked his opinion on reports that the Soviet side does not recognize the passports of American reporters to the Northeast. General Wedemeyer said that he had not heard of it, but he personally treats reporters from any country equally, and hopes that others will also have this attitude. One American reporter stated that he had shown the certificates issued by the US China Theater when he went to Changchun and Shenyang, and they were recognized by the Soviet side, and the process was quite satisfactory. But another American reporter said that the situation was exactly the opposite when he was in Dalian. General Wedemeyer also said that a newspaper reported that Japanese residents widely rumored that the US and the Soviet Union had already started a war, which is an absurd rumor, and modern newspapers must not make such incorrect reports.

Repatriation of Japanese Proceeding Smoothly

The repatriation of Japanese people is currently proceeding very smoothly. The US military headquarters in the China theater has repatriated 642,000 Japanese people. The three locations of Sanmen, Shantou, and Xiamen have now all been repatriated. The Japanese in Taiwan, Hainan Island, Guangdong, and Vietnam can all be repatriated next month. General MacArthur has made thorough preparations to transport the repatriated Japanese to various locations. Currently, China can repatriate an average of about 400,000 people per month. In addition, before February 14, 6,000 Koreans from North China have been repatriated, and 5,100 people from Central China will be repatriated before March 4. There are still 56,000 Korean refugees remaining in China, who are not subject to repatriation and will be decided by the Chinese and Korean authorities themselves. As for Hong Kong, Commander Fitzwilliam is responsible. Regarding the repatriation of Japanese troops in the Northeast, General Wedemeyer has telegraphed the US government to clearly state the scope and authority of his work in China.

Definite Date for Headquarters Closure Undetermined

The US military headquarters in the China theater may be closed in the early summer of this year, but the definite date depends on the work situation. The mission of the US military headquarters is to assist China in repatriating Japanese residents and prisoners of war, and at the same time transport Chinese troops to the Northeast, but if the Communist ceasefire agreement is formally implemented, then troop transport can be stopped. The US military can demobilize after the Japanese have been repatriated to a considerable extent. As for whether every American soldier can return home after the disbandment, General Wedemeyer solemnly replied that Marshal Marshall is the US President's Special Envoy, who came to China to be responsible for assisting China in resolving economic, military, and political matters. In order to assist him in carrying out his work, if we need to continue to stay here, then we should complete the task before returning home.

General Wedemeyer continued to report that some US government officials will come to Shanghai this Wednesday to handle surplus US military supplies.

General Wedemeyer affirmed that news of his return home this month is absolutely unreliable, and he does not plan to go to the Nine Eastern Provinces in the near future.

### Foreign Minister Wang Shijie

There is a Saying That He Will Resign Before the Closing of the Session

[United Press Chongqing Dispatch, 9th] The Kuomintang Gazette reported today that Foreign Minister Wang Shijie intends to resign before the closing of the Second Plenary Session. The Yishibao reported that Premier Song Ziwen of the Executive Yuan will go to Canada and the United States after the closing of the Second Plenary Session.

### US Military Advisory Group to China Established with Approval from Both China and the US; Group Headquarters Located in Nanjing, Personnel Arriving in Succession

[Central News Agency this City Dispatch] General Wedemeyer announced yesterday that the US Military Advisory Group to China has been established with the approval of both China and the US. The group headquarters is in Nanjing, and the internal personnel are as follows:

Group Commander General McClure (Major General, former Commander of the US Operations Headquarters in China), Chief of Staff General Brink (Brigadier General, Staff Officer of the US Theater Command, held important positions in various battlefields during the war), Air Force Training Director General McCaddon (Brigadier General, former Director of the US Air Force in Chongqing, recently returned to China from the US), Army Training Director Colonel McClure (succeeded General Middleton as Commander of the Training Group in China, arrived in Shanghai from Chongqing on the 5th of this month, and went to Nanjing yesterday), Personnel Group Colonel Potter, Intelligence Group Colonel Maxey, Strategy Group Colonel Guthrie, Transportation Group Colonel Calles.

The above personnel are all temporary in nature. The number of people in the group will not exceed 750. The mission is to help China train its troops. It is entirely advisory in nature, and is not employed by China, nor does it assist the Chinese army in combat. Apart from a portion who are members of the US Regular Army, the rest are volunteers. The personnel of the group have been arriving in Nanjing in succession to start work.

[Central News Agency this City Dispatch] General Brink, Chief of Staff of the US Military Advisory Group to China, who is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Nanjing on the 15th of this month, told reporters yesterday afternoon that General McClure, the group commander, has been carrying out preparatory work in Nanjing for two weeks.

### Party and Government Reform Plan Expected to be Established; Plenary Session Continues Discussion on Transportation; Many Questions Raised at the Meeting Regarding Management

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] Chongqing News: After the opening of the Second Plenary Session, the party and government reform movement advocated by some Central Committee members has gained widespread sympathy. It is heard that the majority of Central Committee members advocate that although the Kuomintang will be an ordinary political party in the future, the revolutionary mission entrusted to the Kuomintang by history, the nation, and the state cannot be shirked. Therefore, in order for the Kuomintang to promote party virtue, enhance party reputation, and enrich the party's revolutionary spirit, it must first restore the spirit of the 1911 Revolution. The party fees paid by party members should be used entirely for party-run cultural undertakings and all social welfare undertakings beneficial to workers, farmers, and ordinary people. Party staff should be purely voluntary in order to create a noble party style of "party members vow to support the party with blood and sweat." It is heard that this proposal was put forward by some young Central Committee members and received enthusiastic support from the majority of old comrades of the party. After a concrete plan is established, it is expected to be passed.

[Central News Agency Chongqing Dispatch, 9th] The Second Plenary Session held its eleventh meeting at 9:00 AM today, with 206 Central Committee members in attendance. Chaired by Bai Chongxi, the session continued to discuss transportation issues. Chen Xihou, Dai Kuisheng, Li Zhongxiang, Wang Ruoxi, Zhou Yibin, Pan Gongdian, Miao Peicheng, Wei Yongcheng, and others spoke, raising many questions about transportation management, believing that the recent workers' strikes were caused by poor management. Also, Liu Zhongyang and China Aviation...

[Central News Agency Chongqing Dispatch, 9th] The Second Plenary Session held its twelfth general meeting this afternoon, with 279 Central Executive and Supervisory Committee members in attendance. Zou Lu chaired the meeting. He Yingqin and 37 other committee members temporarily moved to include Guizhou province in the distribution of post-war relief supplies. The chairman decided to submit the case to the Relief and Rehabilitation Review Committee for joint review. Next was the review of the food report, followed by a local political report by Huang Shaohong. The meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM. Furthermore, all members of the plenary session are scheduled to hold a memorial service for Committee members Li Liejun, Ye Chucang, and Li Menggeng at the Youth Hall in the morning of the 10th, and hold the thirteenth general meeting in the afternoon.

### Methods for Handling Pre-War Public Bonds; Minister of Finance Yu Answers Committee Member Pan Gongzhan's Questions

[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 9th] After the Third Finance and Financial Report of the Second Plenary Session, Committee Member Pan Gongzhan submitted a written inquiry stating: The Shanghai Securities Speculation Market uses public bonds as speculation targets, deliberately spreading rumors that the government will use Sun Yat-sen banknotes to pay the principal and interest of pre-war public bonds in order to raise prices and profit from it. The Ministry of Finance has never expressed an opinion on this. A month ago, the Ministry of Finance telegraphed Shanghai, stating that all wartime public bonds would be repaid with principal and interest, but that pre-war public bonds would be handled separately. As a result, the rumors became even worse, and speculation and price increases became more intense. What are the Ministry of Finance's plans and methods for this? Please decide and announce them quickly to prevent rumors, etc. The Ministry of Finance Minister Yu responded to this with a written reply on the morning of the 8th. The details are as follows: Upon investigation, the Shanghai Securities Market has been suspended for a long time since the occupation. Recently, both the Shanghai Securities Market and the gold and foreign exchange markets have been black markets with many rumors. The part about Sun Yat-sen banknotes being used to pay the principal and interest of pre-war public bonds is entirely a rumor. I have repeatedly made statements that our Ministry does not recognize the plan to issue Sun Yat-sen currency. As for the inquiry about all wartime public bonds being repaid with principal and interest, and pre-war public bonds being handled separately, the facts are not as such. According to the regulations of our Ministry, all bonds issued since 1941 will continue to be paid with principal and interest as usual in the recovered areas. Bonds issued before 1941 will be handled separately because bonds issued after 1941 were issued in the rear area, and the bond certificates did not flow into the occupied areas, so there was no loss due to the war. If the bondholders have taken them back to the recovered areas, they should be allowed to pay locally for the convenience of repayment. As for the bond certificates issued before 1941, most of them have flowed into the occupied areas. After the occupation of Shanghai and other places, most of the local banks and bondholders did not take them out, and were lost by the enemy and puppets. If there are losses due to the war, they must be investigated and registered before repayment can be restored. Our Ministry will compile and review the reports from various banks, and formulate handling methods, which will be announced soon. The above methods are administrative procedures that should be in place, and are not a denial of repayment for wartime public bonds.

### Gu Weijun Flies to Chongqing

[Central News Agency Chongqing Dispatch, 9th] Ambassador to the UK Gu Weijun flew to Chongqing at 5:00 PM today. It is said that the purpose of his return to the country is to attend the Second Plenary Session and report to the central government on the proceedings of the United Nations General Assembly, and he is expected to stay in the country for a month. Ambassador Gu will be hosted by Premier Song tonight, and is scheduled to attend the plenary session. Also, Li De, the manager of the London branch of the Bank of China, returned to Chongqing from London on the same flight.

### Tragic Scenes of Yongnian and Dongming Being Besieged

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] People from Beiping say that while the Changchun Military Mediation Office believes that the ceasefire work is generally satisfactory, in the two counties of Yongnian and Dongming in Hebei, which have been besieged for two months, more than 10,000 people have starved to death within the conflict zone. In the above-mentioned two counties, the trapped starving people have now eaten all the dead horses, wild dogs, and rats. If the siege is not lifted within ten days, there will be unspeakable scenes of cannibalism. It is heard that the population of the above-mentioned two counties is less than 80,000 in total due to the five disasters of Communist bandits, floods, droughts, and locusts over the years.

### Chongqing Gold and US Dollar Prices

[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 9th] Factory gold bar opened at 158,000, highest 158,500, lowest 157,000, closed at 157,000. Cast gold bar opened at 155,000 in the morning, closed at 154,000. US dollar opened at 2115 in the morning, highest 2113, lowest 2070, closed at 2080.

### Entering the Northeast Gate

— Special Correspondent Han Qingtao from Goubangzi Reports

From Shanghai and Hong Kong, after traversing the vast South China Sea, East China Sea, Yellow Sea, and Bohai Sea, teams equipped with countless new-style equipment, batch after batch, landed at Qinhuangdao. With orderly steps and imposing presence, they then boarded trains, one after another, heading towards the Northeast. The people felt a sense of glory and peace.

Following a National Army unit heading north, as a reporter, when we arrived at "The First Pass Under Heaven," the red glow of the setting sun had already dyed half the sky. The Great Wall, majestic, stood atop the mountain peaks, its watchtowers like fortresses, stretching towards the northwest, the distant ones shrouded in misty haze, their posture magnificent, their aura boundless.

Leaving Shanhaiguan, we stepped through the Northeast's gate. The ice-covered river surface had already begun to melt. The bare willow branches had already revealed signs of spring. In small courtyards with low walls, the elderly leaned on their canes, smiling and watching the National Army trains from the south. Many women also temporarily stopped their work, and the children, even more so, ran to the railway tracks, their eyes wide with wonder. Many of the people on and off the trains had tears of sorrow that had not yet been washed away!

The scenes from fourteen years ago re-entered my sight. Vague memories became thicker and clearer again. Before me were countless rows of gray flat-roofed houses built with limestone for the sake of economy and warmth, stacks of sorghum stalks used as fuel, earthen cellars for storing winter vegetables, the ridges and manure piles stretching across the land, the large horse-drawn carts galloping on the highways, and the whip in the hands of the young drivers, cracking out with a sharp, crisp sound, the red tassels on the whips flashing in the light of the setting sun.

The train sped across the vast Guandong Plain. On the Beining Railway between Shanhaiguan and Shenyang, the laying of double tracks allowed trains to travel back and forth without obstruction. Along the way, I saw countless destroyed railway new-style houses and railway equipment. A knife-like, sharp pain pierced my heart. The scenery before my eyes darkened with the coming of night!

Station after station, we continued to move forward. The cries of "Huagai pears," "tofu skin," and "salted chicken eggs" from the platforms drifted out from the dim light. As we passed Jinzhou in the middle of the night, the lights of Jinzhou shone very brightly. From the outlines of buildings of all sizes, I could sense the vastness of the Jinzhou urban area. In terms of construction, Jinzhou had indeed made great progress.

Because the water tower at the Daling River had a malfunction, the train engine could not take on water and had to wait for another locomotive to tow it. The cold wind blowing from the Daling River, stinging the skin, threatened the National Army coming from the south, who were all shouting, "The Northeast is really cold!" But there was not the slightest bit of timidity.

As dawn broke, another locomotive arrived, and the train was towed to "Goubangzi." Goubangzi is a market town belonging to Beizhen County, with a Beining branch line connecting the two tentacles of the southern end of Liaoning Province. It is also a connecting point between the middle section of the Beining Railway and the "South Manchuria Railway." The sea and land passenger and freight transportation of Yingkou also has a close relationship with this connecting point.

Currently, the National Army's actions have naturally turned this place into a crucial hub. In order to see the local scenery, I, as a reporter, did not go directly to Huanggu屯, the western suburb of Shenyang where the National Army's vanguard was located, but stayed in Goubangzi. The meaning of "Goubangzi" roughly translates to "along the river ditch," so there is no need for any further archaeological introduction.

Goubangzi is a small market town. There is a fair every third, sixth, and ninth day of the lunar month. People from the surrounding areas come to buy and sell, but goods are very scarce. Based on the exchange rate of thirteen national currency yuan to one puppet Manchurian yuan or Northeast circulation券, prices are of course quite high. One dou of rice costs 350 yuan, one dou of sorghum rice costs 130 yuan, one jin of medium-quality white flour costs 15 yuan, one jin of pork costs 25 yuan, one jin of beef costs 23 yuan, and one sheet of 1.5-foot square window paper costs 1.3 yuan. Cloth has become scarce recently because of transportation and order problems.

Goubangzi has a population of about 20,000. The streets are deserted. There are no large stores, and the small shops don't have much business because they lack goods. Most of the restaurants and hotels cater to military personnel. The military pays the set price, so they are quite popular, and the general population also has a good impression of the military.

I, as a reporter, made a pilgrimage to Beizhen County seat. The county seat is 50 li from Goubangzi. The roads and bridges have been in disrepair for the past year or two, with many bumps and collapses, which is quite disappointing. But when I saw the sincerity and politeness of the men and women in the urban and rural areas, as well as their warmth and straightforwardness, I couldn't help but feel happy and at ease.

This is a city with a population of nearly 30,000. Many of the shops are preparing to regroup because the puppet Manchurian rule, the implementation of rationing methods, and the poverty of recent years have meant they have been living off their savings, waiting for the light. Now they are starting to find ways to procure goods despite the difficulties in transportation in order to restore normal business.

In front of the Confucian Temple is an open-air market for daily necessities and sundries. People from the countryside come here to buy essential items, so many people gather here every day. The general prices are about the same as in Goubangzi. Huagai pears and frozen sour pears are the main products of Beizhen County. The number of pears transported north from Goubangzi by train and large carts is considerable.

The entire county has a population of about 300,000, more than 90% of whom are farmers who rely on agricultural products to sustain their lives. In terms of education, development was restricted during the puppet Manchurian period. In general, children who had completed four years of junior primary school and two years of senior primary school found it very difficult to enter "National Higher" school because this four-year "National Higher education," which is similar to our junior high school, had only a small quota of 150 students and only one location. Those who hoped to provide their children with advanced studies had to pay many bribes to achieve their goal, which resulted in a gradual decline in culture.

The current county magistrate is Yu Xifan. He said that the county government's finances are extremely difficult because the provincial government only allows five tax categories and does not allow any apportionment to local areas. At the same time, it is very difficult to collect the five specified tax items, which has hindered the implementation of all government orders. Regarding education, this year the entire county will temporarily maintain one provincial-level coeducational junior high school and 128 primary schools, so that 10,000 to 20,000 students can attend school.

This place, standing at the foot of Yiwulü Mountain, is the site of ancient Youzhou and also an ancient battlefield. The Tang poem "The cry startles the concubine's dream, unable to reach Liaoxi" refers to this area. Within the 400-li area of Yiwulü Mountain, there are no fewer than 400 temples of various sizes. Within the territory of Beizhen County alone, there are more than 100. In the spring, when pear blossoms are in full bloom, the scenery is exceptionally beautiful. Many people come here to hike and see the sights. When everything is settled in the future, it can be made into a scenic area. I, as a reporter, interviewed many gentlemen and elders at the foot of Yiwulü Mountain. To sum up, their conversations all said in unison: "The hopes of the past fourteen years have been realized like a dream. The homeland has been recovered, and the sun and moon shine again. The National Army, which we haven't seen for fourteen years, has advanced too quickly. At first, we may have been a little suspicious and unfamiliar, but when we saw their actions, we immediately knew that the saviors had arrived. How could we not be moved to tears, and how could we not express our heartfelt welcome?"

Two white-bearded elders told me, the reporter, "When we first saw the National Army, we dropped our canes and repeatedly grabbed the hands of these respectable and lovable armed brothers." The National Army, which stepped through the gate of the Northeast, is indeed welcomed by these people who have returned to the embrace of the motherland, especially after Japan's surrender, they have suffered two disturbances while waiting for the arrival of the National Army, which has further increased their love and protection of the National Army.

### President Song's Political Report (Continued)

Fourth, due to various factors such as the lack of raw materials, obstructed transportation, and enemy sabotage, economic production capacity has become increasingly weak. Since the economic causes mentioned above are numerous and complex, and although the war of resistance has ended, most of the complex pathogens still exist, the shortage of materials remains the same, and there is a global shortage of food. Government expenditures still greatly exceed income because the reduction of the army is in its initial stages. Transportation has not only not recovered, but more sections have been destroyed. Due to the lack of raw materials, coal production and transportation have encountered obstacles, and production capacity is still weak. Therefore, in terms of treatment, it is obvious that it must be carried out from multiple aspects, and both treating the root cause and addressing the symptoms are necessary to overcome it. During the treatment period, if the people understand the root of the disease, they will surely be able to endure it to the extreme, and they will be able to obtain thorough results.

Aiming to Balance Income and Expenditure, While Reducing Military Strength and Increasing Taxes

I will briefly explain the government's response strategy. First, it is to seek a balance between income and expenditure. The largest government expenditure is military spending. During the war of resistance, in order to win victory, we absolutely could not reduce the army. Therefore, we spared no effort to supply military expenses. But after the end of the war, military spending should be actively reduced. Fortunately, our armed comrades have fully understood this. This time, at the military reorganization conference held in Nanjing, the number of divisions was reduced from 253 to 90, which can reduce the national burden. But please note, comrades, that although the downsizing policy has been decided, it will still take effort in the future to fully implement it. At the same time, a sum of demobilization funds is needed, so it will take a considerable period of time to reduce the burden on the national treasury.

At the same time, all expenses that are not urgently needed for economic recovery must also be economized as much as possible within a reasonable scope, because without economic stability, large-scale political and economic construction is absolutely impossible. This is about strict and reasonable economizing on the expenditure side, and on the revenue side, we must try our best to increase it in order to have the hope of balancing income and expenditure.

### French Ships in North Vietnam Violate Agreement; We Demand Compensation for Losses

Both Sides Agreed to Start Troop Transfers on the 16th and Form a Committee to Go to Haiphong to Investigate

[Reuters Chongqing 9th] The Headquarters of the Chinese First Army in Hanoi issued a statement regarding the French ships carrying troops to Haiphong, intending to land there, which caused a conflict, and demanded compensation for the losses suffered after the bombardment. It stated: On March 5, five French ships entered Haiphong port, and the French troops on board attempted to land. The Chinese garrison, not having received orders regarding this matter, did not allow the French troops to land. The French ships then bombarded the garrison, constituting a violation of the treaty. The Chinese garrison then returned fire, after which an agreement was reached allowing French troops to land on the 7th. Both sides have now agreed to start troop transfers on March 16. It further stated: The Chinese troops suffered losses during the French bombardment.

[United Press Saigon 8th] It is reported here today that French troops have landed in northern Vietnam, and no further incidents have occurred. Today, they entered the Tokyo occupation zone. According to the French command, both Tokyo and Hanoi are quite calm. The commander of the Chinese troops in Vietnam, Lu Han, has agreed with the French on how to continue the French troop landings and has ordered the Chinese troops on the front lines not to open fire without authorization. According to reliable sources, Chinese and French representatives have departed for Haiphong to investigate, and an agreement has been reached to form a joint committee composed of representatives from China, France, and the Annam Independent Government to order their respective troops to cease conflict in all war zones.

### New York Newspaper Reports: Soviet Union Demands Territory from Turkey; Byrnes Unable to Confirm

[Reuters New York 9th] The New York Times carried a dispatch from Washington, quoting an authority yesterday, that the Soviet Union has demanded that Turkey cede the Kars and Ardahan districts in northeastern Turkey to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has also informed the United States and Britain of this intention. It is reported that the first formal request was delivered to the Turkish ambassador to the Soviet Union in June of last year and was later brought up for discussion at the Potsdam Tripartite Conference. At that time, the British side questioned Molotov: What is the Soviet Union's policy towards Turkey? Molotov replied: Turkey requested to sign an alliance treaty with the Soviet Union a few weeks ago, but the Soviet Union cannot sign such a treaty until the Kars and Ardahan districts are "returned." According to the above, the above two lands were ceded to Turkey by the Soviet Union in a separate peace with Turkey during the First World War.

[Reuters Washington 9th] Secretary of State Byrnes stated yesterday that the Soviet Union informed Turkey that if the two governments intend to sign any alliance treaty, it should be conditional on first discussing the issue of the Turkish provinces of Kars and Ardahan and the Dardanelles Strait. Byrnes was unable to confirm the claim that the Soviet Union had demanded that Turkey cede the two provinces.

### Anglo-Egyptian Treaty Negotiations to Begin at the End of the Month

[This newspaper] London 9th broadcast: Egyptian Prime Minister Sidky today instructed the Egyptian ambassador to the UK to inform the British government, stating that Egypt is willing to negotiate with the British to revise the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936. The Egyptian ambassador to the UK will leave Cairo today to go to London. This negotiation can begin at the end of this month.

### American Writer Angell Advocates for a Western Bloc

[United Press New York 8th] Writer Angell, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1933, wrote in this month's Mercury magazine: We should organize a Western democratic bloc to supplement the United Nations organization. We should try to make the United Nations organization effective, but at the same time, we must recognize that the United Nations organization is not a perfect organization. As it is only a preliminary model for cooperation between countries, it is not sufficient to guarantee that countries will cooperate. He also said: In today's world, countries have no defense other than cooperation. History has given us another opportunity to organize a Western bloc. If we refuse to do so, it is tantamount to abandoning our most powerful guarantee and stepping into the dark age shrouded by the shadow of the atomic bomb.

### Gliding Bomb Can Track Enemy Ships with Radar; Used by the US at the End of the War

[United Press New York 9th] The Bell Telephone Company's laboratory announced today that at the end of the Pacific War, the US Navy used a secret new weapon called "Bat." It is a gliding bomb, 12 feet long and 10 feet wide with its wings. The front end is equipped with radar, and the bomb weighs about half a ton. It is carried by a mother plane to the air and dropped. It can automatically search for enemy warships and merchant ships from several miles away by reflecting radar waves. If the enemy ship evades, the "Bat" can follow relentlessly and will eventually hit its target. The "Bat" emits sound waves during flight, using the sound wave response to guide the flight, hence the gliding bomb is named "Bat." The US Navy began using the "Bat" in combat last year, severely striking Japanese ships and achieving great success.

### Weekly Forum A Review of China's Diplomatic Relations with the Holy See

— Ye Qiuyuan

The establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the Vatican during the War of Resistance was a major achievement in China's diplomacy. The Vatican, with an area of only 108.7 acres, is the smallest independent country in the world. Its importance in international relations lies in the fact that it is the residence of the Roman Pope, who is the spiritual leader of Catholics scattered all over the world. The Pope and the Holy See are an institution that transcends the mundane world. It does not directly participate in international politics; however, the more than 400 million Catholics around the world pay close attention to the Pope's words and deeds, as well as the measures taken by the Holy See, and the impact is far from insignificant. The dispatch of envoys by various countries to the Holy See has various reasons. Some European and Latin American countries have almost their entire populations as Catholics, so their governments need to maintain close contact with the Holy See, and therefore send envoys to the Holy See. The Holy See also needs to maintain close contact with the governments of these countries due to the large number of Catholics in these countries, and therefore sends envoys. In addition, since the decline of the Roman Empire, throughout the long Middle Ages and into modern times, the Roman Pope was the sole supreme authority in Europe; most European countries sent envoys to the Holy See to show respect for the Pope and the Holy See. Some countries, such as France and Spain, even considered the envoys stationed at the Holy See to be the most important positions for their diplomats. The result of the "Religious Reformation" was that the Nordic countries broke away from their historical relationship with the Roman Pope, but soon, although they failed to return to Rome in terms of religious belief, because Catholics still existed in the country, and at the same time, in order to utilize the position of the Vatican, they also sent envoys to the Holy See one after another. For example, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands both sent ministers, and pre-war Germany sent an ambassador to the Holy See. The United States, in view of the importance of the position of the Holy See, President Roosevelt sent Myron C. Taylor with the rank of ambassador as his special envoy to the Holy See. For these reasons, although the Vatican is a small place, envoys from various countries gather there. This is indeed a meaningful event in modern international relations.

As for the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the Holy See, it was put on hold until after the outbreak of the War of Resistance, especially after the attack on Pearl Harbor. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Japan sent Ken Harada, a counselor at its embassy in France, as its first minister to the Holy See, and later promoted him to ambassador. At that time, envoys from various countries gathered in the Vatican, and Germany, Italy, and Japan all had envoys stationed there. The United Kingdom, the United States, and Latin American countries on the United Nations side also had envoys stationed at the Holy See. In order to seize the diplomatic initiative and at the same time counter Japan's measures, the National Political Council passed a resolution in February of the 31st year of the Republic of China, requesting the government to establish diplomatic relations with the Holy See and transferred it to the government for implementation. Based on this resolution, the government conducted negotiations with the Holy See to establish diplomatic relations. Initially, Xie Shoukang, our chargé d'affaires in Switzerland, conducted the negotiations. Later, the negotiations moved to Washington, D.C., where our side was represented by Song Ziwen, the then Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Hu Shize, who conducted negotiations with Archbishop Cicognani, the Papal Delegate to the United States, and reached an agreement. Our country would send a minister to the Holy See, and the Holy See would continue to carry out its mission with the original Papal Delegate to China. In May of the same year, the government announced that Xie Shoukang would be our first minister to the Holy See; after receiving the order, Xie immediately traveled from Switzerland to his post in a special car prepared by the Holy See. At that time, China had already declared war on Germany and Italy, so after Xie took office, he lived in a residence specially prepared by the Holy See and could not step out of the Vatican, because once he left the Vatican in front of St. Peter's Basilica, he would be in Italian territory. Since we had declared war on Italy, Xie's actions were not free. Xie lived in seclusion in the Vatican for more than two years, until Germany and Italy collapsed. Only then did he find a site in Rome and formally establish our legation to the Holy See. Xie had lived in Europe for many years, was fluent in French, and had a deep understanding of Western European literature and art. The Holy See and the Vatican are the holy land of Western art and literature. From the Roman era to the Renaissance and into modern times, all artistic and literary treasures are concentrated in the Vatican. Xie, who was well-versed in Western European culture, was extremely competent and happy to serve as our country's first minister to the Holy See. As a result, Xie enjoyed a high reputation in the diplomatic corps of the Holy See.

Since Pope Pius XII appointed Bishop Thomas Tien Ken-sin, Vicar Apostolic of the Qingdao Vicariate Apostolic, as the first cardinal of our country, some people, including some Catholics, believe that the Pope is extremely concerned about our country's religious affairs, and the Chinese government is willing to establish friendly relations with the Holy See. Therefore, they have paid close attention to our country's diplomatic relations with the Holy See; some advocate upgrading our country's envoy stationed at the Holy See to an ambassador, while others advocate requiring the Holy See to send a formal minister or ambassador to China, believing that since our country has sent a minister to the Holy See, and the Holy See has not yet sent a minister or ambassador to China, it is a one-way street and close to an unfriendly act. The former Chongqing China Catholic Cultural Promotion Association sent representatives to Rome to participate in the Cardinal Consistory Ceremony to celebrate Tien's elevation to Cardinal. After arriving in Rome, the representatives telegraphed Bishop Yu Bin, the Papal Delegate of the Nanjing Vicariate Apostolic, saying that the Holy See was considering sending an ambassador to China, and the person to be selected would be announced soon. Regardless of what measures the Holy See will take on this issue, it would not be entirely useless for us to review our country's diplomatic relations with the Holy See at this time.

According to the investigation, the Holy See has four types of envoys stationed abroad: (1) Legates a latere are special envoys who represent the Pope on certain specific occasions; (2) Nuncios represent the Pope to foreign governments and handle affairs between the Holy See and the host country; (3) Internuncios are envoys with lower positions than ambassadors, representing the Holy See to promote relations with the host country; (4) Apostolic Delegates represent the Pope to oversee religious affairs in the host country. Our country's Apostolic Delegate began in August of the 11th year of the Republic of China. On August 9th of that year, the Papal Delegation to China was officially established in Peiping. The first Papal Delegate to China was Archbishop Celso Costantini; Costantini came to China in the summer of the 11th year of the Republic of China and was relieved of his position in the winter of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, and the current Papal Delegate Archbishop Antonio Riberi succeeded him until now. In the past 23 years, in addition to supervising the affairs of the Church in China, the Papal Delegate to China has accepted the preferential treatment given by the late Chairman Lin and the current Chairman Chiang in his capacity as Pope's representative; he has also participated in the funeral of the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen with the same status as the diplomatic corps in China as the Pope's representative. Even the current Papal Delegate Archbishop Riberi, who went to Chongqing in October of last year, was also treated generously by Chairman Chiang and the women of the nation, as well as our Minister of Foreign Affairs. Our country's dispatch of a minister to the Holy See is only a matter of the past two or three years, while the Holy See's dispatch of a representative to our country has been more than 23 years, so it cannot be said that the relationship between our country and the Holy See is just a one-way street, with only coming and no going.

The current question is: Since our country has sent a minister to the Holy See, why doesn't the Holy See send a minister or ambassador, but still continues to carry out its mission with the Papal Delegate? According to known information, when representatives from our country and the Holy See were negotiating the dispatch of envoys in Washington, D.C., there was such an agreement that our country would send a minister to the Holy See, while the Holy See would continue to carry out its mission with its original Papal Delegate to China. The reason why the Holy See has not sent a new envoy is largely based on this agreement. Whether the Holy See will send an ambassador or minister to China in the future is up to the Holy See to weigh, and we need not speculate on it here. However, there are several points worth noting here: (1) The late President Roosevelt sent a special envoy with the rank of ambassador to the Holy See, while the Holy See's representative to the United States was still the Papal Delegate; (2) The United Kingdom sent a minister to the Holy See, while the Holy See's envoy to the United Kingdom was also the Papal Delegate; (3) The Holy See's ambassadors are mostly stationed in Catholic countries such as France, Belgium, Poland, Hungary, and various Latin American countries. According to international practice, the Holy See's ambassador, regardless of seniority, should be the leader of the diplomatic corps in the host country. This is not a problem in Catholic countries, but in non-Catholic countries, due to the constraints of international relations, it is often inconvenient; (4) The dispatch of the Holy See's ministers is only two out of the Holy See's 59 envoys abroad, one in Lithuania and one in the Netherlands, which is actually a less important position.

Based on the above points, it can be seen that the Holy See has to be cautious about the dispatch of envoys to China. Although China has 4 million Catholics, it is not a Catholic country after all. The dispatch of an ambassador, even if it is not absolutely unthinkable for the Holy See, it is doubtful whether this move is wise for the benefit of the host country; moreover, since there are examples to follow in the United Kingdom and the United States, the "Papal Delegate" can accomplish the mission, and there is no need to change it. If it is said that a minister can be dispatched, there is no need to do so, because the position of the Holy See's minister can only represent the Holy See's Secretary of State and cannot represent the head of state, the Pope. Its position is not as important as the "Papal Delegate," who can represent the Pope. Considering the above, we really don't need to have our own strong opinions. This is the most reasonable and most appropriate measure for the Holy See. Why wait for more words? Mr. Wang Liangchou and other experienced diplomats in our country have praised the Holy See's diplomacy as being highly sophisticated. We can believe that whatever measures the Holy See takes, it will be carefully considered and well-planned, and there will be a great purpose behind it.

The Holy See's dispatch of an envoy to China is one thing, and our country's dispatch of an envoy to the Holy See is another. The Holy See's emphasis on China's position and China's religious affairs can be seen in the recent promotion of Bishop Thomas Tien Ken-sin to cardinal; but how will we show our friendship towards the Holy See? Considering the importance of the Holy See's position in international relations, and in view of the fact that the late President Roosevelt sent a special envoy with the rank of ambassador to the Holy See, our country should upgrade our minister stationed at the Holy See to an ambassador. According to international practice, the minister represents the foreign minister of his country, while the ambassador represents the head of state. It can be seen that our current minister stationed at the Holy See cannot represent the head of state, but can only represent the foreign minister, which is not enough to show solemnity. For the sake of today, our minister to the Holy See should be quickly upgraded to an ambassador. There is no need to make the Holy See's dispatch of an ambassador as a quid pro quo (Quid Pro Quo). The diplomatic initiative lies in the term.

### 100,000 Smokers Should Turn Back Sooner Rather Than Later - Total Registered is Still Less Than 1,000 Since Registration Began - Deadline for Signing Self-Reform is Approaching

[Reported by this Newspaper] According to news from the Municipal Police Bureau: Since the implementation of the measures to eliminate opium addiction in this city, it has been stipulated that smokers must register with their respective police stations before the end of March of this year and sign a pledge to reform themselves; and they must completely quit opium before the end of June of this year. As of the current investigation, the total number registered is still less than 1,000, while it is estimated that there are more than 100,000 smokers in the city. This shows that most smokers are adopting a wait-and-see attitude, and some mistakenly believe that there is no difference between registering before or after the deadline. In fact, once the deadline for registration at the end of March has passed, those who apply for self-reform again, or those who are found to have not registered, will still be punished according to the law. Smokers should pay special attention to this point. Furthermore, in order to take into account the cost and location of opium addiction treatment for smokers, the Municipal Health Bureau is currently submitting a request to the Municipal Government to approve measures for free opium addiction treatment in public and private hospitals in Shanghai, so that smokers who are unable to afford it can also find ways to quit opium.

### Authorities Confer and Discuss - To Save the Industrial and Commercial Crisis

Recently, prices of goods have been soaring in this city, and workers in various industries are often forced to demand salary adjustments due to livelihood problems, resulting in work slowdowns and strikes. In view of this, the municipal authorities convened an emergency meeting yesterday afternoon, organized by Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau, with representatives from industrial trade unions across the city, as well as representatives from the Social Affairs and Economic Affairs departments stationed in Shanghai. After two hours of discussion, two important matters were decided: (1) Actively restore the resumption of work in existing factories to meet the goal of increasing production and suppressing prices, and to rescue unemployed workers. (2) For the repatriation of unemployed workers, priority should be given to technical personnel returning to Shanghai from the southwest hinterland, generally in a ratio of six to four with local workers.

### Water Level Slightly Rising in the Upper Reaches of the Yangtze River - Two Steamers Will Sail to Hankou and Yichang the Day After Tomorrow

[Reported by this Newspaper] Since last winter, the water level in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River has declined sharply, making navigation extremely difficult. The water levels in the Shanghai-Hankou and Yichang-Chongqing sections are even more depleted. According to news at the beginning of the month, repatriation transportation in the Chongqing-Yichang section is about to be suspended. According to the shipping industry, the water level has risen slightly recently in the Xunyang-Hankou section of the Shanghai-Hankou line. It is now entering the spring flood season, and it is unlikely to decrease significantly afterward. As for the Yangtze River steamers on the Shanghai-Hankou line, no formal transport ships have sailed upstream for three weeks. Transportation relies solely on various small steamers, iron barges, and motorized sailing ships. It is now learned that the Jianghua and Jiang'an steamers of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company have successively arrived in Shanghai. The Jiang'an is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Hankou next Tuesday. The Minzu steamer of the Minsheng Company is also scheduled to sail directly to Yichang on the same day.

Geng Xin and others representing Huacheng served as the presidium. The association charter was passed, and important proposals such as tax rates were discussed. What distinguishes this association from the pre-war era is that foreign-owned cigarette factories such as Yizhong and Citibank participated as members this time, so it is hoped that tax issues can be handled uniformly in the future. Finally, Pan Bonian, Dai Gengxin, Ding Panquan, and others were elected as directors and supervisors.

### False Adjutant Cheng Zhaohai - Repeatedly Extorted and Blackmailed - First Trial at the High Court Yesterday

[Reported by this Newspaper] Cheng Zhaohai, a Shanghai native, served as a lieutenant adjutant in the 26th Brigade of the Thirteenth-First Division of the puppet army in July of the 30th year of the Republic (1941), and later rose to the rank of captain of the special service team. He participated in extortion on several occasions. In September of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), he served as an inspector of the puppet police station. In the spring of the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), he collected 200,000 puppet currency from local villagers in Minhang under the pretext of repairing bridges. After the victory, he was reported and arrested by the Shanghai County Government and transferred to the Shanghai High Procuratorate for investigation and prosecution according to the law. Cai Jin, a judge of the High Court, held a court hearing yesterday morning to interrogate the defendant. The defendant admitted to serving in a puppet position, but denied having kidnapped, extorted, or defrauded anyone. The court ordered that he be remanded for another hearing at a later date.

On the same day, Wang Yongqing, the leader of the special service team in the puppet Fahua Town, and Hui Youyuan, who manufactured military supplies for the enemy, were also tried. After investigation and questioning, they were all ordered to be remanded for another hearing.

### Tea Industry Appeals to the Government - Urging the Determination of Tea Loan Measures

Important for Relieving Tea Farmers and Foreign Trade Relations

Representatives from four organizations, namely the Shanghai Tea Merchants Association, the Shanghai Tea Export Association, the Shanghai Store and Tea Association, and the Southeast Tea Region Factory Association, including Du Yong, Zhu Hua, and Shou Jingwei, entertained the press at the Xinghualou Restaurant on Fourth Horse Road yesterday afternoon. Shou Jingwei, former general manager of the China Tea Company, gave a speech, stating that tea is a major export product of China. Now that the tea season is approaching, he hoped that the government would expedite the tea loan program to purchase tea from various regions in order to maintain tea farmers and benefit foreign sales. Subsequently, Zhu Huiqing, Zhu Hua, Wu Juenong, Tang Jisan, and Sun Xiaocun reported on the tea production in Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Fujian provinces, the plight of tea farmers and tea merchants, and the details of tea exports. They unanimously hoped that the government would quickly implement a tea loan program, requiring 100 billion yuan nationwide, to be loaned out before the Qingming Festival in order to save this year's tea production crisis. The associations have jointly telegraphed Chairman Chiang and the Second Plenary Session, requesting that the responsible authorities be ordered to allocate special funds for tea loans, designate banks, and follow the already approved silk factory loan measures, whereby tea merchants first pay 30% as preparation and apply for a 100% loan from the designated banks.

### General Post Office - Shanghai Office Closed

### U.S. Assistant Secretary of the Army - Royal to Arrive in Shanghai

### Municipal Chamber of Commerce Submits Petition to the Government - Requesting Temporary Suspension of Road Demolition

To Prevent Residents from Being Disoriented and Homeless

The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, based on a joint letter from Zhou Caigui and other representatives of merchants and residents living on boundary roads in the city, requesting that the government authorities temporarily suspend the matter of demolishing houses to make way for roads, has specially submitted a letter to the Municipal Government, stating that according to the residents, the notice No. 26 issued by the Shanghai Municipal Land Administration and Public Works Bureau on February 19, stating that "all houses obstructing boundary roads must be completely demolished before March 15," is no different from a bolt from the blue. The residents have endured hardships during the War of Resistance. If the demolition of houses on boundary roads is implemented, where will the hundreds of households find shelter in the midst of the city's housing shortage? Therefore, they are submitting a special document requesting that the government authorities quickly withdraw their order to relieve the hardship. It is the responsibility of the Chamber. Although post-war construction requires a hundred things to be done, it seems that making people avoid being disoriented and homeless should be the first priority. At a time when the housing problem is causing serious panic, the demolition and immediate relocation would leave thousands of people homeless and wandering the streets. This kind of tragic phenomenon, for the suffering people after the war, is truly difficult to remain silent about. It is reasonable to submit a letter stating the situation, hoping that the government will consider the people's livelihood and hardship, which has reached its extreme. The demolition and road construction of the Land Administration and Public Works Bureau should be temporarily suspended so that the residents of that road will not be disoriented and homeless.

Engineering Benefit Fee

[Reported by this Newspaper] Recently, due to the widening of Zhongzheng Road, Zhejiang Road, and other roads in the city, shops along the roads have been charged an "engineering benefit fee." In order to understand the truth, the reporter visited a senior official of the Municipal Public Works Bureau, who explained as follows: Widening roads can make the city prosper and increase the value of real estate. Shops on both sides benefit the most, so it is reasonable to pay a corresponding fee. Twenty years ago, cities such as Guangzhou, Taishan, Wuzhou, and Nanning in China also adopted this method when expanding roads. Therefore, citizens should recognize their own interests and pay according to the regulations for the benefit of both public and private sectors.

### Repatriation of Japanese Nationals Expected to Be Completed by the End of June

### Sayings About the Rejection of Northern Air Mail Are Not True - The Authorities Have Now Explained the Truth

Recently, due to China National Aviation Corporation's reduction of the quantity of mail and newspapers transported to the north, rumors of "rejection" and "prohibition of transport" have arisen. However, according to the responsible authorities, there are currently one thousand several hundred people from various departments applying to go north to take over work. In addition to ordering the Ship Allocation Committee to find ways to dispatch ships to Qingdao and Tianjin for transportation, the quantity of mail and newspapers transported to the north by air is too large, accounting for one-fifth of the total air transportation volume. Therefore, for the sake of weighing priorities, the China National Aviation Corporation was instructed to temporarily reduce the number by half in order to free up capacity for passengers. This is actually a temporary measure. Once concrete measures have been formulated, the restrictions will be lifted and mail and newspapers will be transported to the north as much as possible.

### The Case of Robbery and Kidnapping at the Haijing Factory Solved - Extremely Valuable Stolen Goods - All Recovered in Hefei Road and Other Places - More Than Ten People Arrested and the Investigation Continues

[Reported by this Newspaper] After the victory, the Japanese-owned Haijing Paper Mill at No. 101, Lane 770, Huashan Road, Shanghai West, was sealed by the authorities, and a large number of paper, machinery, and other assets in the factory were sealed. Unexpectedly, at 1:30 AM on the 7th, several men in military uniforms and plain clothes, leading more than ten laborers, rushed to the factory in several cargo trucks.

The temperature yesterday ranged from a high of 45.9 degrees to a low of 39.6 degrees.

Yesterday, smelted gold continued to trend from stable to brisk. It opened at 1.68 million in the morning, and after the opening, it was initially very calm. Silver shops made slight replenishments, and people were anxious and absorbed it. Before long, it returned to around 1.78 million. At this time, it was close to the time for the Bank of China to announce the exchange rate, so buyers temporarily watched, and it struggled greatly below 1.75 million for a long time. When fellow merchants obtained 468 bars at a price of 1.7 million, spot sales once again became strong, and the price once rose to 1.8 million before noon, then slightly declined, struggling around 1.75 million. As a result, the closing price continued to rise by 80,000 compared with the previous day. Silver shop jewelry was 190,000, tael silver was 1,600, and silver dollars still hovered at the original price.

Yong Yarn once fell to 3300 yuan, Meiya below 2450 yuan, and Jingfu around 155 yuan. Later, due to the stagnation of the gold market due to the distribution, speculative funds had no way out and gradually returned to the market, gradually improving.

Ever since the securities gang buyers invaded the yarn market, these two brands have been used as a tool. The price of Double Horse warehouse receipts has exceeded the spot price, which shows that the speculative atmosphere is heavy. Other 20-count brands also rose by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. Although people are supportive, sales have not been smooth. The Textile Construction Company opened sales of woolen fabrics, cotton blankets, and other items totaling 25 kinds yesterday. It is reported that cotton yarn will be sold as usual next Monday.

Yesterday, New York cotton telegrams reported that US cotton futures and spot goods were priced at around 12 to 23 pounds. In the local cotton market, except for Textile Construction and private cotton mills that remained on the sidelines and took a wait-and-see attitude, cotton merchants were not lonely with each other due to the strong yarn prices. Prices rose by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan compared with the previous day.

### Tinplate Has Softened

Moreover, there is talk of overseas orders arriving soon, so prices are stagnant and are softening daily.

Yesterday, the police station sent personnel to closely monitor the rice market, so transactions became idle, and prices were similar to those of the previous day. Very few transactions were made. Afterwards, the reporter was informed by Xing Zhigang, managing director of the Soybean and Rice Industry Association, that the future of the rice market is expected to decline, and that the food for the people in this city is expected to be worry-free. A person in charge of the Grain Administration Office also told the reporter that Yang Xizhi, the special commissioner of the office, is expected to return to Shanghai today or tomorrow after flying to Chongqing to ask for instructions on the grain policy of this city. By then, the plan for purchasing rice loans will be earnestly implemented. The sources, procurement, transportation, supply, and adjustment of rice and grain all have a careful and complete plan. If implemented step by step, they can always be promoted to their full advantage. It is also reported that the United Nations will have 20,000 tons of rice shipped in batches.

Yang Xizhi, the special commissioner of the Shanghai Grain Administration, went to Chongqing to meet with Minister Xu to ask for instructions on the 200 million yuan rice merchant loan. It is reported that after verification, all bean and rice firms can obtain this loan, but the amount of the loan will be determined according to the ability of their original capital to purchase rice and grain. That is, if a certain rice firm can have 1 million yuan of working capital to purchase rice and grain, it can borrow 1 million yuan from the office. There are two purposes for this regulation: (1) to ensure that all rice merchant funds are used to purchase rice and grain, and (2) to prevent these funds from flowing into other industries. If this method is implemented, the city's rice merchants can use at least 400 million yuan of funds to purchase a total of 200,000 stones of rice at one time. It is also learned that the four state-owned banks of China, China, Communications, and Agriculture have allowed the issuance of this loan, and the interest rate is 3%.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Tea Market The varieties of red and green tea have recently become narrower, buyers are not smooth, and they are trying to suppress prices in every possible way. However, those who hold the goods are reluctant to sell them lightly due to the high cost, so supply and demand are scarce, and the market is still stable.

Timber Yesterday, the timber market was trending steadily. Because the price of gold rose, people were excited, but the weather was rainy, and sales were not good, so transactions were quite scarce.

Industrial Raw Materials Caustic soda rose slightly, but few transactions were made. It is heard that deliveries next month are about 30-40% lower than the market price. It is heard that Bunem will distribute goods next week, but the number of sites is not large, and the market price is rising.

Daily Necessities Yesterday, there were few transactions at the beginning. Later, because various counterparts on this street added some items, the market was still not prosperous. As a result, except for Arrow Knife, the rest of the soap returned to small. Western candles were stable, and the Beautiful brand of matches was favored, and the market was slightly firm. Phoenix also stood on the original market.

### Construction of New North Station Requires 300 Million, Railway Authorities Plan to Request Instructions

[Our newspaper] It is reported that a new and large railway station will soon appear in this city to meet the needs of this city as a national commercial center. The existing North Railway Station in this city was completed in the 31st year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty. The top two floors of the North Station Building were destroyed by artillery fire during the January 28th Incident. With the current congestion of passengers on the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways every day, the station is really not enough to cope. The two railway authorities are now preparing a plan to build a new North Railway Station in this city. If the project is completed, it will cost 300 million yuan. The planned new North Station covers an area of ​​about 520 feet long and about 60 feet wide, between the current North Station and the current North Station Building, and is a six-story building. The ground floor of the new building has ticket windows, station master's office, luggage room, waiting rooms for passengers of all levels, telegraph management room, new-style wine row room, etc.; and there are special rooms for rent for business operations and public bus companies, etc. The remaining floors will be the writing rooms of the two railway administrations. The current North Station Building facing the boundary road will be converted into a station hotel. It is reported that the project will soon be submitted to the Ministry of Communications for approval to start construction.

Film and Theater "Model Teacher" Performance Special Issue

### "Model Teacher" Performance Preface

— Luo Xuelian

Drama is the most powerful weapon for propaganda and education. In the eight years of arduous Anti-Japanese War, the dramatic movement developed vigorously and made the most rapid progress: dramatists have made indelible contributions to inspiring people, encouraging popular sentiment, and awakening the national people to dedicate themselves to the Anti-Japanese War.

The China Electric Drama Troupe was established in 1938. Initially, it was an organization in Lai Yu of the Central Film Studio. Later, as the work expanded, it became a formal group under the Central Film Studio. Over the years, it has successively performed dozens of plays such as "Peach and Plum Spring Breeze", "Earth Returns to Spring", "Punishment", "Song of Righteousness", "Golden Jade Mansion", "Mountain City Story", "Model Teacher", and "Rhapsody of a Little Man". I dare not boast about the merits and demerits of the achievements, but I have never dared to slacken my diligence and dedication in advancing with the Anti-Japanese War and growing with the audience. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has victoriously ended and the work of national construction is urgently needed to be accelerated, the China Electric colleagues detoured through Hunan and Hubei and rushed to Shanghai, hoping to report to the compatriots in the recovered areas and call on the whole country to move forward towards the road of national construction. "Model Teacher" is a masterpiece by Mr. Yuan Jun. It has been performed in Chongqing for a long time. It has been deeply loved and highly praised by the audience for its profound description and grand significance. President Jiang personally watched the play on his 58th birthday and also gave awards. China Electric chose it as the first performance program to meet the people in Shanghai. The lineup of actors is mostly the same. After being re-rehearsed, it is hoped that there will be more progress. I hope that people from all walks of life will give advice, and I especially hope that all parties will help the troupe's future work, which will be extremely honored and eagerly anticipated.

### Era

— Tie Mei

"Model Teacher" writes about three generations of teachers: Fang Yida, Fang's son-in-law Lin Tong, and Lin's son-in-law Guan Shenghong. Lin Tong and Guan Shenghong both have lifelong partners who understand and can help them - Fang Errou and Lin Xiaorou.

The actors who play these characters in the play are Yue Lu (Fang), Geng Zhen (Lin). Zhang Yan (Guan), Bai Yang (Erer) and Sally (Xiaorou).

For them, what I especially want to point out here are the two characters Lin Tong and Fang Errou. On the stage, they both experienced twenty years of time, which means that the author wrote about their young age (the May Fourth Movement) and their old age (after the Anti-Japanese War), so the actors were required to play young people and have to play old people.

On the Chongqing stage, everyone knows that Bai Yang and Geng Zhen are accustomed to playing young people. But when Geng Zhen played "Shi Dakai", it was no longer a young role. Bai Yang in "Golden Jade Mansion" played a mother in her forties and fifties. They expanded the scope of their performance. I think a good actor should have this ability.

Stereotyped acting is not a training. Actors who rely on a set of housekeeping skills limit themselves. Now, how are Geng Zhen and Bai Yang's acting skills? It is not convenient to make a hasty judgment. Let's talk about it after the official premiere; however, this is undoubtedly a road that should be taken.

Similarly, in his personal experience, Zhang Yan has more opportunities to play old people, but now he is a young and strong lad.

The three generations of education circles who are steadfast have appeared on the stage. We also hope that there will be such a family in the actors. This requires actors to develop themselves in many aspects on the stage (adapt to many roles), never leave their jobs, perform from the age of twenty to sixty or seventy, young people can play old people, and old people can play young people.

### The Story of "Model Teacher"

In 1919, during the May Fourth Movement, Fang Yikui, an old professor at a university in the western suburbs of Beiping, held a tea party at home to introduce the newly hired lecturer Lin Tong, but it clearly aroused the jealousy of those such as gilded professors Lou Guodong and Shi Yunjia. Only the old Professor Fang and his daughter Fang Errou understood and respected him. Only in this bit of warmth did Lin Tong feel at ease to accept the letter of appointment and work.

A year later, Lin Tong had already won the universal love of the students at the school. On the eve of the May Fourth Movement, he led the students to prepare to march and demonstrate to the traitors Cao Zhang and Lu You. Old Professor Fang Yikui himself was unable to participate due to illness, but he strongly supported them. Fang Errou also resolutely rejected the marriage proposal of Zheng Chuxiong, a classmate who was hot for five minutes and ended badly, and followed Lin Tong into the tide of the great era.

The May Fourth Movement broke out vigorously, but Lin Tong and his colleague, the art teacher Liu Fuwan, were unfortunately arrested and detained for more than fifty days. Fang Errou's anxiety revealed her love for Lin Tong, which made Fang Yikui feel a little comforted in his anxiety and critical illness. Finally, with the support of the national strike, market strike, and school strike, Lin Tong and others were finally released. In the warm cheers of countless students, he took Errou's hand and said: "Errou, I will never leave you again."

Time flies, Lin Tong taught at the university for 20 years. After the outbreak of the sacred Anti-Japanese War, he also moved to Changsha with the school. His student Zheng Chuxiong became the dean of the Faculty of Arts. He himself also had a daughter Xiaorou and a son Xiaotong. His family life was happy and beautiful, but the country was in turmoil, and this kind of happiness was destroyed. A bomb blew up their family property, and most of the school buildings were also bombed. The school had to agree to the students' request and move to Kunming on foot. Lin Tong led the students on a rugged long journey again. He was always with the students.

Later, in a small inn on the way to Kunming, it was drizzling. Lin Tong's son Xiaotong fell ill. Lin Tong was busy greeting the students and Rou to their residence, food, and encouraging the students' emotions. He had no time to take care of him. Student Guan Shenghong and others wanted to ask him to stay for another day to treat Xiaotong's illness, but he refused. Suddenly, Lou Guoliang, who had changed his career and became the boss of a transportation company, also unexpectedly met in this small town. Although he met an old friend in his hometown, today's Professor Lou was purely a market salesman full of alcohol. Under the low and dark eaves, Xiaotong finally died muttering. In unparalleled grief, Errou said with tears in her eyes: "Let's leave early tomorrow morning!"

Five years passed again. The Anti-Japanese War entered the most difficult stage. Many professors, like Zheng Chuxiong, could not stand the poverty and changed their careers to do business. Only Lin Tong, although so poor that he did not have money to treat Errou's illness, buy medicine, boil water, or buy charcoal, still remained poor and self-sufficient and taught tirelessly. Lin Tong destroyed his family to relieve the country's difficulties, his son died and his wife was sick. After teaching for half his life, what reward did he get? Zheng Chuxiong said: "There is no reward for teaching!"

There is a reward, this reward comes from the vast number of students. Under his influence, his daughter Xiaorou and his student, who is also his new son-in-law Guan Shenghong, swore to him that they would teach for a lifetime. At the same time, countless of his students automatically opened a "Celebration of Professor Lin Tong's 25th Anniversary of Service at the School" to express their admiration for him. In the cheers, Lin Tong and Errou accepted the "Model Teacher" banner with tears in their eyes.

### "Model Teacher" China Electric Troupe will perform at the Lyceum Theater starting on the 12th of this month Lin Tong (played by Geng Zhen) Fang Errou (played by Bai Yang)

### Words and Deeds of a Model Teacher

We cannot, like grass covering insects, turn our heads and seek another path as soon as we encounter difficulties. The cause of education, like any cause, can only discover its meaning by resolutely overcoming difficulties and weathering tribulations.

--Fang Yikui

It's a rather tragic thing when national affairs must be questioned by students... But, having reached this point, have the esteemed gentlemen in our government uttered a single word of questioning? Do these traitors have even a shred of restraint? If our students don't shout, who will? If our students don't ask, who will?

--Fang Yikui

You are happy because you give; because you give people knowledge and happiness.

--Lin Tong

For every additional person who makes a fortune off the nation's troubles, the nation loses one more unit of vitality. For every additional person who steadfastly holds their post, the nation gains one more unit of strength.

--Lin Tong

It's easy to do something brave on the spur of the moment, but it's truly difficult to persistently and painstakingly adhere to an ideal.

--Lin Tong

I can't imagine that someone who is a professor, someone responsible for educating other people's children, would also play the tricks of a politician!

--Lin Tong

### Ode to a Model Teacher

--Fang Yikui

You are someone who sows seeds on the land of the motherland.

You are a wise man of humanity,

Because you give,

Therefore, you are happy;

For the citizens of the infant era,

You have cultivated countless flowers of wisdom.

Lin Tong

In the dense forests of desolate Yan,

Our wise men,

Have already discovered that you will be

A towering, magnificent tree,

Giving you sunshine,

Giving you the nourishment of love.

Facing the storms of the era,

You finally stand up strong,

Like a lighthouse in the raging waves.

With the brilliance of your wisdom,

Illuminating the paths of the children,

Brightening the memories of the descendants.

Fang Errou

Like a clear flowing spring,

Like dewdrops on glistening flower buds,

Nourishing the unseen

Roots of wisdom,

For the sun-loved

Plump fruit,

Like the spring sun nurturing all things,

You rejoice in the tender shoots

With a green vitality.

Fang Xiaorou

Just like your mother,

You are in the garden of wisdom

A fragrant flower.

From the dark nights of wind and rain,

To greet the morning sun of dawn.

When the sun shines,

You will be a pair of vigorous wings,

Soaring in the clear sky of the motherland,

Carrying the words of the wise,

Singing praises to the spring of the motherland.

Guan Shenghong

With the strength of steel,

With the might of a lion,

Crossing countless rivers and mountains,

Bearing the wind and frost of the motherland on your shoulders,

From your loud and clear name,

We have already heard the

Voice of the future era.

### A Glimpse of Criticism of Performances in Chongqing

Among the several programs performed successively during this foggy season, we believe that "Model Teacher" is indeed the most complete and wonderful play. At a time when Chongqing's theater movement is intentionally or unintentionally leaning towards amusement and gimmicks, being able to see such a regular and conscientious performance is not only commendable but also prompts us to express our infinite respect to the group from "China Electricity"!

--Collective Criticism, Chongqing Xinshu Bao

"Model Teacher" wrote about a topic that is difficult to be liked, but the author was able to handle it into a refined and popular masterpiece. In terms of artistic achievement, we should give it a high evaluation... The play further demonstrates the author's energetic spirit and passionate enthusiasm, and is more skillful in technique.

--Mr. Langqin, Shixing Chao Wenyi

"Model Teacher" truthfully depicts a great personality that is not easy to depict truthfully, and also vividly depicts a realistic lesson that is not easy to depict vividly... Due to the proper allocation of actors, harmonious cooperation, and dedicated performances, it must also be due to the director's precise handling and concise depiction of emotions, making this "high-level intellectual play" easily accepted by the general public. --(Mr. Keni, Chongqing Xinmin Bao)

The play flashes with a high Te-mpo, a freely rotating rhythm, and a complex and compact compilation, like a gurgling stream, passing through rock forests, making the sound of metal and stone. --(Mr. Shu, Chongqing Xinmin Wanbao)

### Anecdotes

In "Model Teacher," there are many hairstyles. Shen Yang's head is bald, Liu Housheng's is covered with luxuriant grass, Bai Yang's is evenly divided, and Si Huzi's crown is tilted up toward the sky.

There are five child actors in "Model Teacher," causing great trouble for the stage crew. It is said that five nannies, male and female, have now been found to take charge separately.

Li Enjie, the set designer for "Model Teacher," has a toothache. Due to overwork and tension, the ailment suddenly broke out, confining him to bed for three days, crying and suffering endlessly, hence his name "Innocence."

Some say that Bai Yang has successfully become a thousand-faced person among actors. This time, she started playing a maiden of the May Fourth era and continued to play an old woman during the War of Resistance, truly "playing each role like the real thing."

Geng Zhen also started playing a young man and continued to play an old man during the War of Resistance, but Shen Yang started playing the old man and continued to play his son, going back in time instead.

A well-wisher wrote a couplet for "Model Teacher," saying: Geng Zhen, the model teacher of the ages; Bai Yang, the eternal example of virtue.
