### Hopeful Progress for Peace and Unity: Zhang, Zhou, and Marshall Arrive in Beiping Yesterday; Three Figures to Fly to Chahar and Suiyuan This Morning for Inspection

[United Press, Beiping, 28th] U.S. Special Envoy Marshall, General Zhang Zhizhong, and General Zhou Enlai flew from Chongqing this morning aboard a C-54 transport plane, braving the snow towards Beiping, arriving here at 2:40 PM. The crowd at the West District Airport welcoming them included Chinese and American military leaders, civil officials, and diplomatic personnel. The American consulate staff in China, and Commissioner Robinson of the Beiping Executive Headquarters were also present to welcome them. After exchanging greetings with the welcoming party, Marshall, Zhang, and Zhou drove into the city of Beiping to the Union Medical College, the location of the Executive Headquarters, where they immediately held a meeting with the three Beiping Commissioners Zheng Jiemin, Ye Jianying, and Robinson. These "Three Giants" of China are expected to fly to Zhangjiakou, Chahar, Jining, and Suiyuan tomorrow morning, to conduct a mobile inspection of areas where the Executive Headquarters has successfully stopped the conflict between the Nationalists and Communists. They are scheduled to return to Beiping tomorrow afternoon. During his stay in Beiping, Marshall will reside at the American Embassy. When Marshall's plane arrived in Beiping, the morning haze had cleared, and the three landed in the bright spring sunshine. Also accompanying them was Lieutenant General Gillem, Marshall's assistant who recently arrived in China. General Wedemeyer will also arrive in Beiping from Shanghai tomorrow. It is said that Gillem and Wedemeyer's arrival in Beiping has nothing to do with the Executive Headquarters and is "purely coincidental."

Cocktail Party Held

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 28th] The three commissioners of the Mediation Executive Headquarters held a cocktail party at the Beijing Hotel on the evening of the 28th to welcome Marshall, Zhou, and Zhang. Xiong Shihui, Sun Lianzhong, and important officials from the Allied nations of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union were all invited to attend. Those who attended spoke with the three figures one after another, and the atmosphere was very harmonious. Communist Party representatives from various regions especially enjoyed their conversations with Zhou Enlai.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 27th] Government sources in the Executive Headquarters hinted that after completing his inspection of North China and the Han-Yue region, Marshall's second inspection area may be the Northeast. The Communist spokesman stated that Marshall's trip to the Northeast is unlikely before further agreement is reached between the government and the Communists on the Northeast issue.

[United States Information Service, Beiping, 28th] The three-man military group arrived in Beiping this afternoon. Special Envoy Marshall then hosted reporters at the Mediation Executive Headquarters, stating: "The individuals who are working to prevent civil war and strive for peace and unity in China have now made hopeful progress in completing their work. Our current task is more important and difficult than the task of stopping the war. Our task is to unify the Chinese army and implement demobilization in accordance with the agreement established by the three-man military group in Chongqing. Many people believe that such problems cannot be resolved peacefully. It would be surprising to learn that there were no difficulties in reaching an agreement. However, an agreement has now been reached, and the task of the Mediation Executive Headquarters is to supervise its implementation. The harmony among the Nationalist, Communist, and American personnel working together in the Mediation Executive Headquarters is unprecedented in world history." Zhou Enlai and Zhang Zhizhong praised the outstanding service of the American personnel in the Mediation Executive Headquarters and expressed their gratitude. Both likened the Chinese civil war to a quarrel between siblings in a family and advocated putting aside the question of right and wrong and first uniting China. Zhou said: "Let us complete the work of unity! Now is not the time to quibble and decide who is right and wrong."

### Improving Judicial Work; Three Key Points to Be Emphasized in the Future

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] In order to adapt to the needs of national reconstruction after the war, the Ministry of Judicial Administration is actively promoting judicial reform. It is reported that future plans will focus on three points: (1) The improvement of prisons to make them modern; (2) The cultivation of judicial talent and the improvement of their quality; (3) The reform of the judicial system. Regarding the reform of the judicial system, the ministry has obtained approval from the Executive Yuan to hire Dr. Pound, a world authority on jurisprudence and a legal reform expert, as a consultant. Once the National Government returns to the capital, Pound will depart from the United States for China.

### Smooth Postal Service Restoration in Recovered Areas; Unimpeded Mail Delivery to Communist Areas; Significant Monthly Losses for All Bureaus Nationwide

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] This reporter recently visited Mr. Gu Chunfan, Deputy Director-General of the Postal Administration, to inquire about the current status of the postal service in the recovered areas and the Communist-occupied areas. According to him, the postal service restoration in the recovered areas has been completed smoothly, except for the Communist-occupied areas. During the enemy-puppet period, postal workers in these areas were ordered to remain on duty and lived in extremely difficult conditions. In the six months before the victory, the salary of each postal worker was worth less than two dou of rice, resulting in widespread dereliction of duty among postal workers and the bad habit of letter carriers demanding tips. After the restoration, salaries were slightly increased, and this undesirable phenomenon has been completely eradicated through active rectification. As for mail currently sent to Communist-occupied areas, there are no obstacles, but the quantity of mail sent from Communist areas is extremely small. All post offices in Communist areas are still under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Communications, but the Communists have established a Bureau of Communications that "cooperates" with local post offices. In some areas, Communist stamps with images of Mao Zedong are even being used, which is an illegal act that infringes upon the postal service. The postal service restoration in the Northeast is currently underway, but the situation is still uncertain, and mail exchange is still difficult. Mr. Gu also stated that postal revenue cannot be compared with that before the war. According to recent statistics, the total monthly loss for all post offices nationwide averages between 1.3 billion and 1.4 billion yuan. The monthly loss for the Jiangsu postal district alone is as high as 200 million yuan. The Shanghai postal district, which was the most profitable before the war, is now only able to maintain a balance between income and expenditure. After the victory of the War of Resistance, all work can be restored, and the postal service is no exception. Improvements are anticipated, but they will depend on the recovery of transportation and general commodity prices; otherwise, the future of the postal service will be fraught with difficulties.

### Postal and Telegraph Inspection to Cease Today

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] Sources have revealed that our government has recently issued an order to cease postal and telegraph inspection from March 1st.

### Signing Ceremony for Military Reorganization Plan Observed

Our Newspaper Chongqing Air Mail

On the evening of January 24th, the reporter received a notice from the Press Office of the Central Propaganda Department stating that at 4:00 PM the following day, an important document—a new achievement, a new agreement of the Three-Man Military Group meeting—would be signed at the Yao Mansion on Zhongsi Road, and that reporters were required to attend the ceremony. All colleagues were greatly encouraged by this news!

The next day (January 25th), the sky was somewhat overcast in the morning, but after noon, the sun burst forth, plating the earth with a layer of gold, generally symbolizing happy events.

Inside the auditorium, a yellow carpet with light red flowers was laid. In the center was a desk, simply furnished with a sheet of glass and writing materials. Mercury lamps stood on either side of the desk, and behind it was a screen with purple-red curtains, leading to the inner lounge. At each end of the hall were large square tables covered with white tablecloths, on which were placed black lacquered boxes containing "Happiness Brand" cigarettes. In addition, there were chairs along the walls, but still a third of the people were standing.

At 4:50 PM, Marshal Marshall and his entourage arrived, passed through the hall, and went to the lounge behind. At 4:58 PM, the original texts of the three plans were brought out by Minister Zhang Zhizhong's translator and placed on the desk. These were three volumes bound in blue silk. The reporters immediately became tense, stood up together, and formed a semicircle around the desk. The mercury lamps lit up, eclipsing several wall lamps with soft light. In the whirring sound of the cameras, Marshal Marshall came out first. Minister Zhang and Mr. Zhou Enlai also stepped into the hall. At this time, the reporters standing in the back impolitely stood on chairs. As soon as Minister Zhang came out, he walked straight to the desk, sat down, and began to sign, moving each of the three original copies to the right after writing on them. Mr. Zhou Enlai signed second, quickly moving them to the left again. At this time, Marshal Marshall was discussing the signing method with Minister Zhang's translator. As a result, he took out his Parker 51 from his pocket and signed each of the three volumes horizontally. Subsequently, Minister Zhang delivered a speech on behalf of the government, guaranteeing the implementation of this plan. He especially praised Marshal Marshall, saying that the Chinese people had several names to call Marshal Marshall. The first was: "The midwife of China's peaceful nation-building." When Marshal Marshall heard the word "midwife," the corners of his smiling mouth involuntarily widened. The second name: "The matchmaker between the Communist Party and the government." The translator was stumped by "matchmaker" and turned to ask Li Weiguo, the Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department. Li Weiguo thought for a moment and said, "Use 'Go-between.'" The reporters burst into laughter, but the foreign friends, including Marshal Marshall, did not understand. The third name was: "The envoy of peace sent to China by the American people and government." "Any one of these three names is worthy of General Marshall. General Marshall is the greatest friend of China!" Mr. Zhou Enlai also represented the Communist Party in assuring the government, the Chinese people, and friendly nations that this plan would definitely be implemented. He said: "I believe that this document can clarify the past situation of armed conflict and replace it with unity, solidarity, peace, and nation-building." He particularly emphasized that the implementation of this plan had no exceptions in any region or among any armed forces nationwide. He also attributed credit to Marshal Marshall and thanked Minister Zhang, who had worked together for twenty years. Finally, he hoped that through the efforts of the reporters and newspapers, the people of the whole country would urge the implementation of this plan.

Marshal Marshall spoke last, his words were brief but heartfelt. After he finished, servants served tea and snacks, and the three gentlemen each finished a glass of champagne, giving the photographers a good shot. At this time, the reporters surrounded Minister Zhang and Mr. Zhou Enlai. The reporter first took out his business card and asked Marshal Marshall to sign it. Wu Jun, a reporter from the Nanjing Central Daily News, also took the lead in asking Zhang and Zhou to sign, and the three were indeed busy for a while. The reporters also repeatedly toasted, wishing each other good luck and celebrating peace. At 4:55 PM, Marshal Marshall said goodbye, and Minister Zhang and Mr. Zhou both escorted him to his car. A two-star general's car took away this distinguished guest, and this precious press conference was declared adjourned. (Sent on the 24th)

### Engineers' Society Commemorates Zhang Xinfu

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 28th] The Chinese Institute of Engineers, the Chinese Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, and the Tianfu Coal Mining Company held a memorial service for Mr. Zhang Xinfu on the 27th. More than 200 people attended, including members of the Institute of Engineers such as Weng Wenhao, Chen Lifu, Zhang Jia'ao, and Shen Yi, senior figures in the mining and metallurgical industry such as Wu Renzhi, Zeng Zhen of the Chongqing Alumni Association of Peking University, as well as people from the industrial sector and representatives from various academic groups. Weng Wenhao presided over the ceremony and read three eulogies. Cao Chengke then reported on Zhang's biography, Liu Mengxi reported on the circumstances of his martyrdom, and Zhang Jia'ao delivered a supplementary speech.

### Our Authorities in Changchun Host Foreign Reporters

Tea Party Scheduled for Today

[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 27th] Today is the third day since the foreign reporters arrived in Changchun. They said: "For the past two days, we have been confined to a small room, and although we are bored, there is nothing we can do. Today, we moved about on the streets, and although we could not see the whole city, we felt a little more comfortable." They had requested an audience with Marshal Malinovsky, but were unable to meet him due to his busy schedule. In the afternoon, they visited Dong Yanping, the head of the military delegation, and Zhao Junmai, the mayor of Changchun. It is said that the military delegation will hold a tea party on March 1st to entertain them. It is not yet decided whether they will go to Harbin.

### Negotiations on the Withdrawal of Soviet Troops from the Northeast are Underway in Moscow; We Will Send a Large Army to Strengthen the Takeover

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] Chongqing News: It is learned that our government has decided to send an army of 300,000 to the Northeast to strengthen the takeover work. There are currently about 60,000 National Army troops in the Northeast. 200,000 troops will continue to be transferred from various regions. 100,000 National Army troops from Shanghai, Qingdao and other places are awaiting transportation to the north.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 27th] The number of Soviet troops in the Northeast has recently increased rather than decreased. An official source who recently returned from Changchun told a reporter that it is difficult to buy cigarettes in Changchun because a large number of Soviet officers have come east from Europe, and the cigarettes in Changchun have almost been entirely distributed to the Soviet officers. Officials have indicated that negotiations on demanding the Soviet Union's withdrawal of troops are underway in Moscow, but it is still difficult to predict whether they will succeed. This is because our side hopes that the Soviet Union will first fulfill its treaty obligations to withdraw troops before discussing issues outside the treaty. The Soviet side, however, intends to first determine its economic interests in the Northeast before discussing the withdrawal of troops, and its demands for economic interests seem quite insistent. It is said that when Chiang Ching-kuo visited the Soviet Union last time, the Soviet authorities said to him that the Soviet Union's interpretation and handling of war booty in the Northeast was the same as that implemented in Eastern European countries, and it was not unique to Northeast China. Therefore, the entanglement of economic issues may not be easily resolved. On the other hand, the Soviet Union seems to regard "time" as its useful friend, because if the Soviet side is given another two or three months, they can calmly digest their war booty in the Northeast and support forces that are more pro-Soviet than the Nationalist government. For this reason, the situation in the Northeast is like malaria, with alternating chills and fever. The takeover work in the Northeast is currently at a standstill. Chairman Gao Xibing of Andong has not yet taken office. Chairman Wu Huanzhang of Xing'an and Mayor Shen Yi of Dalian turned back halfway. Chairman Wu Hantao of Hejiang and Chairman Han Junjie of Heilongjiang are still staying in their Harbin residences, sleeping in their clothes every night, so they are covered in lice. The takeover personnel in Changchun and Harbin are currently deeply troubled by the dilemma of advancing or retreating. Although the Changchun Railway Council has been established, the real power belongs to the Soviet side. It is said that three-quarters of the Soviet staff are Red Army officers who have changed professions. The takeover of factories and mines in the Northeast has also been suspended since Zhang Xinfu's sacrifice. However, it is said that our side will not concede any factories and mines south of the former Chinese Eastern Railway (from Manzhouli to Suifenhe), while Soviet capital and technology can be discussed and accommodated in the northeastern region of the Chinese Eastern Railway. In general, people judge that General Bai Chongxi's visit to Beiping is not for the purpose of inspecting the army, but for reviewing the military situation in the north with Xiong Shihui, Li Zongren, and Du Yuming. This shows the central authorities' concern and emphasis on the north.

[Reuters, London, 28th] Minister of State Baker stated in the House of Commons yesterday, in response to a question from Conservative MP Savory: "The Chinese and Soviet governments are negotiating the date of the withdrawal of Soviet troops stationed in Manchuria. For this reason, I am unable to make any announcement at this time."

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 27th, United Press] It appears that the Soviet troops in the Northeast intend to stay for a long time. 30,000 to 40,000 new Soviet troops have arrived at Port Arthur. This is reinforcement, not troop rotation, to support the existing Soviet troops, and they are now being assigned to various garrisons in the Northeast, including Dalian and Harbin.

### Editorial: The Change of Jurisdiction of Sakhalin Island and the Kuril Islands

On the 20th of this year, the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union issued an order incorporating South Sakhalin Island and the Kuril Islands into the Soviet Union's territory. At the same time, transportation, banks, enterprises, public utilities, and transportation equipment in the area were nationalized. Thus, what was once regarded as an obstacle to the Soviet Union's access to the Pacific Ocean has been completely eliminated, and the Kuril and Sakhalin Islands have officially changed their jurisdiction to the Soviet Union, becoming part of the Soviet Far East. On the 26th of the same month, US Secretary of State Byrnes made some remarks on this matter at a press conference in Washington, D.C., stating: "The United States accepts the obligations of the agreement and has agreed to support the transfer of this territory to the Soviet Union. When treaties are concluded in the future, he will insist that the United States should fulfill its promise and include clauses in the treaty incorporating the aforementioned territory into the Soviet Union's territory." Thus, the Soviet Union's annexation of Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands is not only an accomplished fact, but also has the support of the US government. At a time when the gloom in Northeast China awaits clearing and international disputes await resolution, the Soviet Union's annexation of the Kuril and Sakhalin Islands may not have attracted much attention from the world. However, this annexation not only allows Soviet power to penetrate deep into the Pacific Ocean, but also creates a new situation in the entire Pacific region. Our country, located on the west coast of the Pacific, should pay close attention to this new situation in the Pacific. Regarding the Soviet Union's annexation of the Kuril and Sakhalin Islands, we cannot remain silent.

First, the Soviet Union's annexation of the Kuril and Sakhalin Islands was originally based on the Yalta Agreement. Even though the Yalta Agreement involved the participation of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, it cannot be regarded as having general international binding force. Furthermore, it was a secret agreement, and the agreement concerning the transfer of land is, in its nature, close to a private transaction, with no legal basis. Regarding the disposition of Japanese-owned land, unless acquired through aggression, it should be transferred only with the unanimous approval and support of the countries that fought against Japan, especially the major countries that fought against Japan. Our country has fought against Japan for the longest time and has made the greatest sacrifices. It should have the right to inquire about how to dispose of Japanese land. China did not participate in the Yalta Conference, and the agreement reached at Yalta has no binding force on China. Therefore, we should reserve the right to make demands regarding the Soviet Union's annexation of the Kuril and Sakhalin Islands based on the Yalta Agreement. In today's prevailing "power politics," we must raise the legal significance of this issue so that the spirit of the rule of law can be seen in international actions and international order can be maintained.

Second, Sakhalin Island was under Chinese jurisdiction during the Ming Dynasty. At the beginning of the Ming Dynasty, Emperor Yongle managed the border areas, and his power extended to the area around the mouth of the Heilongjiang River in present-day eastern Siberia. He also established garrisons. Sakhalin Island and the area around the mouth of the Heilongjiang River are separated by a strait, and in winter, it freezes over. Ming troops managed this area, and there are historical records to prove it. The fact that this island has a Chinese name shows that it was under Chinese jurisdiction. In the early Qing Dynasty, the Treaty of Nerchinsk ceded the area around the Outer Khingan Mountains to Russia. Thus, China's relationship with Sakhalin was severed. From a historical point of view, China cannot remain silent about the change of jurisdiction of Sakhalin Island.

However, what prevails today is the era of "power politics." What our country is concerned about is that the Soviet Union's annexation of the Kuril and Sakhalin Islands has caused a new disturbance in the balance of power in the Pacific Ocean and created a new situation in the Pacific. What is this new situation? It is that the Soviet Union now occupies a dominant position in the North Pacific. Since Peter the Great's efforts to develop Russia, its consistent desire has been to go to sea, to have an ocean. In Europe, this desire has been blocked, and in Asia and the Far East, it has also been blocked occasionally. Now that the Kuril and Sakhalin Islands have changed their jurisdiction to the Soviet Union, it occupies a controlling position in the Pacific, especially the North Pacific. The Kuril Islands face the Aleutian Islands of North America; the Aleutian Islands were once occupied by Japanese troops. Tsar Peter the Great's dream has been realized under Chairman Stalin, who opposes Tsarism. Having achieved their long-cherished wish, the emotions of the Soviet people are not difficult to imagine.

The leakage of atomic energy secrets in Canada, the lingering gloom in Northeast China, and the balance of power in the North Pacific have changed. After the lessons of Pearl Harbor, humanity should have a new awakening. We hope that the Pacific Ocean can be peaceful for a long time!

### Sino-French New Treaty Signed Yesterday: France Returns Concessions and Renounces Privileges in China; Chinese Troops in Vietnam to Withdraw by the End of This Month

[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 28th] The Sino-French Treaty on the Renunciation by France of Extraterritorial Rights in China and Related Privileges, and the Sino-French Agreement on Vietnam were signed at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 4:00 PM on the 28th. Wang Shijie, Minister of Foreign Affairs, represented China, and M. Meyrier, the French Ambassador to China, represented France. Those present included Gan Naiguang, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs; Qin Dechun, Vice Chief of the Military Operations Department; Wang Huacheng, Wu Nanru, and Li Jun, Directors of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and secretaries and military attachés from the French Embassy. After the ceremony, Minister Wang and the French Ambassador shared champagne, congratulating each other. Several important outstanding issues between China and France have thus been resolved. It is generally believed that the traditional friendship between the two countries will be further strengthened in the future. The main points of the signed documents are as follows: (A) The Sino-French Treaty on the Renunciation by France of Extraterritorial Rights in China and Related Privileges is generally similar in content to the Sino-American and Sino-British New Treaties. It stipulates: (1) France formally renounces consular jurisdiction in China and the rights granted by the former Boxer Protocol, and agrees to return the Legation Quarter in Beijing, the Amoy International Settlement, and the French Concessions in Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangzhou to the Chinese government. (2) France renounces all rights regarding special courts in the treaty ports in China, the Amoy International Settlement, and the French Concession in Shanghai; employing foreign pilots in various ports within Chinese territory; French warships entering Chinese territorial waters; French ships engaging in coastal trade and inland navigation within Chinese territorial waters; and requesting the appointment of French citizens in Chinese postal agencies. (B) The Sino-French Agreement on Sino-Vietnamese Relations stipulates: (1) Regarding the treatment of overseas Chinese, Chinese people in Vietnam shall continue to enjoy all the rights they have historically enjoyed in Vietnam, and the taxes they pay shall not be heavier than those paid by the Vietnamese people. Regarding legal procedures and judicial matters, they shall enjoy the same treatment as French people. (2) Regarding international transit, the French government agrees to provide all necessary facilities for the transit of Chinese goods in Haiphong port. Chinese goods transported from the Sino-Vietnamese border to Haiphong via the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway shall be exempt from customs duties and shall be free to transit. Chinese goods passing through the Vietnamese railway shall be exempt from all transit taxes. (3) Regarding the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, the 1903 Yunnan-Vietnam Railway Agreement shall be repealed from the date of signing of this agreement. The section of the railway within Chinese territory, that is, the section from Kunming to Hekou, shall be completely transferred to the Chinese government, and the Chinese government shall redeem it. The amount to be paid shall be advanced by the French government to compensate for the material losses suffered by the Chinese government and people due to the suspension of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and the blockade of Haiphong port due to Japanese interference in 1940. France shall request payment of this advance from Japan. Regarding the improvement of railway transportation between China and Vietnam, the French side declares that it will submit a concrete plan in the near future. (C) Regarding the exchange of notes on Chinese troops stationed in Vietnam, France declares that it is prepared to assume full responsibility for managing Japanese prisoners of war in northern Vietnam, maintaining local order, and protecting overseas Chinese. Therefore, the Chinese government has decided to complete the transfer of defense by the Chinese troops before March 31 of this year and withdraw immediately.

### Foreign Minister Wang Issues Statement: Hopes Vietnamese Disputes Can Be Resolved Fairly

[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 28th] After the signing of various agreements between China and France today, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie issued the following statement: Northern Vietnam is within the Chinese war zone. Therefore, at the request of the Allied Supreme Command, the Chinese government sent troops to Vietnam to accept the surrender of Japan. Now that the disarmament of Japanese troops has been completed, and the French authorities are prepared to send troops to the area, the Chinese government is deeply concerned about the internal disputes in Vietnam. However, it is undeniable that the Chinese people sympathize with the Vietnamese national movement. The Chinese government sincerely hopes that the disputes among the relevant parties in Vietnam can be resolved fairly. What we especially hope is that all parties can avoid bloodshed and reach a resolution. If such a fair and peaceful resolution is achieved, it will not only greatly benefit the Vietnamese people, but also have a very positive impact on the resolution of similar incidents in other parts of the world.

[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 28th] After the signing of the Sino-French New Treaty on the 28th, reporters interviewed French Ambassador M. Meyrier, who made the following remarks: The treaty we just signed should be regarded as an epoch-making standard in the history of Sino-French diplomacy. These treaties have cleared up some past realities and difficulties, and have designed other agreements yet to be signed, and are themselves the seeds of new agreements. I deeply hope that in the near future, I can negotiate with the Chinese government these agreements that respect sovereignty and conform to the principles of modern international law, so as to promote close cooperation between the two countries in various fields such as culture and science. The spirit of mutual assistance shown by both sides during this negotiation is the best guarantee of the sincere cooperation between the Chinese and French people that we expect in the post-war reconstruction process. The future achievements of Asia also bring us a bright omen. On the solid foundation of Sino-French friendship, I am confident that a cornerstone of a new building has been laid today.

### Territory Not Yet Fully Recovered: Eastern Mongolian Autonomy Not Discussed; Representatives' Trip to Chongqing Called Off

[Beiping, This Newspaper, 27th] The Eastern Mongolian representatives' trip to Chongqing is likely to be called off. Although they still hope to go to Chongqing, Mani Badara and others have stated that the issue of Eastern Mongolian autonomy can only be considered after the country has fully recovered the Northeast. At present, the territory has not been recovered, so there is no point in talking about autonomy. When Vice Chief of Staff Bai was in Beiping, the relevant authorities convened a meeting to discuss the Eastern Mongolian issue and made a decision.

[Tianjin, United Press, 28th] It is heard that after meeting with General Xiong Shihui, Mani Badara has cancelled his plan to go to Chongqing. He now intends to fly to Changchun and then return to Hailar. It has also been announced by the Central Government that the name "Inner Mongolia" will no longer be used, but a more appropriate alternative name has not yet been given.

### Allocation of National Ships: Establishment of Nanjing Branch

[Nanjing, This Newspaper, 28th] In order to adapt to the reconstruction and transportation plan, the National Ship Allocation Association has recently decided to establish a Nanjing branch. It has designated the building opposite Wharf No. 4 on the Xiaguan Jiangbian as the address of the association. It will start operating tomorrow. The business of the branch will be hosted by Hong Ruitao stationed in Beijing.

### Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia Sign Mutual Assistance Treaty

### US Proposes Joint Declaration to Overthrow Franco Government: To be replaced by a Provisional Government of Democrats

Spain has increased troops to defend the French-Spanish border

[This Newspaper News] London, 28th Broadcasting: According to well-informed sources, the Franco government may soon be abolished. The issue of establishing a provisional government by Democrats may be submitted to the United Nations Security Council for discussion.

[Washington, United Press, 28th] According to reliable diplomatic sources, the United States has proposed a joint declaration to encourage the Spanish people to overthrow the Franco regime. The United Kingdom and France have agreed in principle. It is expected that the original text of the declaration will be slightly revised and issued simultaneously in Washington, London, and Paris.

[Washington, United Press, 27th] The State Department announced today that the United States has notified the United Kingdom and France of certain proposals regarding the Spanish issue, but the contents of the note will not be released for the time being. According to diplomatic sources, the United States is likely proposing that the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France declare their disapproval of Franco and express their dissatisfaction with the continued existence of the Franco government.

Commercial News

### Outside Traders Take Advantage of Low Prices, Yarn Market Sentiment Stabilizes, Raw Cotton Transactions Remain Sluggish

Yesterday, the yarn market showed signs of recovery, mainly because the continuous decline in prices had been significant. Outside traders, who had been observing for several days, took advantage of the low prices to absorb supplies, causing prices to rebound by 40,000 to 70,000. The sixteen-count Guangming yarn, which has a "rubber ball" characteristic, initially fell to 830,000 but then rebounded to 890,000. Market sentiment at the close stabilized, and the trend was flat. The Textile Construction Company continued to sell various counts of cotton yarn at reduced prices yesterday to meet the needs of the factories. It is reported that cotton cloth will be sold at reduced prices today.

Yesterday, the spot cotton market continued to be weak, and transactions decreased significantly. The yarn and cloth market was weak, and the price cuts by manufacturers were very deep, making negotiations difficult. The Textile Construction Company was also watching and had not made any purchases. In addition, only Shenxin No. 6 Mill, a private yarn factory, had a slight demand for two to three hundred bales of sixteen-count raw material "fire engine flower," with prices down by one to two thousand compared to the previous day.

### Gold Prices Continue to Fall Slightly

There were people trying to cover short positions by buying at lower prices, with the price reaching 1,420,000 yuan, and even reaching 1,450,000 yuan at its highest. Later, due to rumors that the exchange rate for the US dollar would be 1,000 to one, and reports that the authorities would soon list gold, sentiment softened, and bulls sold off. The price fell to as low as 1,370,000 yuan at one point. Around 11:00 AM, northern traders entered the market to cover, and the price rebounded to 1,400,000 yuan. In the afternoon, the market continued to soften, with few buyers at 1,380,000 yuan.

Foreign currencies were weaker than in the previous session due to the continued decline in gold prices and softening sentiment, with buyers watching. The US dollar fell to around 2,000 yuan, and Hong Kong dollar old bills were 370 yuan, with new bills down 3 yuan.

### Northern Traders Absorb Consolidated Bonds

Trading in consolidated bonds has gradually started to pick up quietly, with northern traders showing strong interest. All bonds are rising, with Type C rising to 1,700 yuan, up 200 yuan from the previous session. Types A and B rose by 100 yuan, Type D followed up by 150 yuan, and Type E rose by 80 yuan.

### Idle Funds Seek Opportunities, Stock Market Shows Activity Again

Shanghai stocks have fallen for many days, but yesterday saw a sudden rebound. Many retail investors closed out positions, and with gold and cash trending sluggishly, some idle funds flowed back into the stock market. Trading in the unofficial market was quite active. With demand exceeding supply, all stocks were strong. Wing On Textile Mill rose to 2,500 yuan, finally closing at 2,450 yuan. Mei Feng even reached the 2,000 yuan mark. Jingfu had few transactions, but the trend was firm. New Kwong rose by more than 20%, and Kun Hing rose by 10 yuan, continuing to rise in the afternoon.

Foreign stocks were strong due to strong buying from those with idle funds. Jardine Textile Mill rose by 100 yuan, Wheelock Marden rose by 1,500 yuan, and British American Tobacco rose by 300 yuan. Paper and shipping stocks each rose by 50 yuan, and most others were firm.

### Woolen Cloth Spring Sales Begin, Local Businesses are in Good Spirits

Yesterday, sales of woolen cloth on this street were lively, as spring sales continued to gain momentum. There was a surge in selection and purchase of men's and women's clothing in Western and Chinese styles. Generally, business owners, seeing that the outlet is widening day by day, have had an increase in appetite. For example, Xin Da Xiang, Xie Da Xiang, Kuan Da Xiang, Li Yu Xiang, and the four major companies all have strong appetites. Clothing traders in Szechuan Road, Avenue Joffre, Daxin Street, and Jing'an Temple Road all made considerable purchases. The standard prices at the public tea party were high because salt inventories were lacking, and the Central Textile Company's offerings were mostly thick fabrics and lacked thin fabrics. The prices were not very cheap compared to the market price, and they were not widely available. In addition, the crazy rise in yellow and white goods and various other environmental factors have caused the prices of all kinds of men's and women's colored, lustrous, coarse, and fine woolens to rise across the board.

### Silk Continues to Decline

Artificial silk has fallen by 500,000 yuan in four days. At the 120-day Tianqiao spot market, the opening price was 1,900,000 yuan, and the closing price was 1,750,000 yuan. In the afternoon, it traded at 1,770,000 yuan. Semi-gloss increased by 100,000 yuan, and matte was even more expensive, with transactions at over 2,300,000 yuan. Factory silk prices were weak, and trading was very familiar. Five-dan head silk from Jiangjing was bid at 1,500,000 yuan, but the counteroffer of 1,400,000 yuan did not result in a transaction. Silk fabrics were slightly softer, with Mei Ya bedspreads down 10,000 yuan from the previous day, Da Cheng lattice crepe down 100 yuan, and Minsheng brocade down 1,000 yuan.

### Rice Prices Rise Again

The rice market was slightly active yesterday due to the rainy weather, and prices rose by 1,000 yuan. Flour from Qingdao and Ningbo had good demand, and prices rose by 100 to 200 yuan. Soybeans also rose by 300 to 500 yuan, and the oil market followed, rising by nearly 1,000 yuan. Soybean cakes rose slightly by 100 yuan, while bran was flat and weak, down nearly 100 yuan. Raw peanuts remained stable, with the various grains showing signs of hovering at noon.

### Tea Market Transactions Sluggish

The volume of red and green tea transactions has not yet increased. Buyers, seeing that prices in the city have been declining in recent days, are trying to suppress prices, but sellers are waiting for better prices as inventories dwindle. Therefore, although negotiations are still taking place, they are difficult to reach an agreement, and only sporadic transactions are occurring, making the market firm and quiet. Prices are stable and unchanged. Yesterday, West Lake Longjing was sold at 2,400,000 yuan, Zhuji black tea at 72,000 yuan, and Huangshan Jasmine at 140,000 yuan.

### Summary of Business Conditions

Yesterday, the cloth market was quiet all day, and the Rong traders remained in a wait-and-see attitude. In the afternoon, there was a slight improvement.

The sugar market has been firm for a long time. Medium sugar is flat and sluggish due to the need for local taxes for cotton white exports. The market is stable. Taiwanese white sugar is still firm. Qingchi inventory is not large, and it is quite active due to northern traders. The market is quite firm.

Sales of cotton textiles are sluggish and transactions are quiet. The industry is speculating about the exchange rate and prices have fallen again. However, the price of Sanju men's socks was too low yesterday, and retail investors rushed to buy them, so the market has slightly recovered.

Daily necessities are sluggish due to continuous rainy days. Beautiful matches are in short supply and prices are lively. The rest are turning weak.

The cigarette market opened with weak sentiment. Except for Old Knife, China Merchants Da Mei Li, which were slightly firm, the rest were consistently downstream.

Western medicine continued to fall yesterday. Local households are selling a lot, but household medicines are still at the original price due to strong sales.

There are too few Kolapay goods for stationery, and the market is generally out of stock. Transactions are lonely due to the end of the month. Generally, the psychology is to wait and see.

China Standard Weaving Factory produces standard brand handkerchiefs. It has a long history. Due to environmental influences during the war, it temporarily stopped working. After the victory, it greatly expanded and carefully reorganized, and now it has resumed production.

Spring and Autumn

### Reunion

—

On a winter night, we walked into a tavern and chose a seat by the window facing the street. The weather was very cold, as if it were about to snow. The street lamps emitted a faint light. This street was usually quite prosperous, but today it seemed unusually desolate. The few pedestrians who were there also hurried past with their heads shrunk.

So many years of separation had made us both quiet. How big the world is 　is hard to believe. Just yesterday, we ran into each other on the street. It was so sudden. He had just come from the mountain city. He told me that he couldn't believe that I had been staying in this bustling city for so long.

We seemed to have a lot to say. Six years apart, the changes of these long years 裘 were really too great, but we didn't seem to know where to start. Time was too short, after all. He said that he would be leaving here tomorrow. We could only sit face to face, looking at each other, letting the sake be poured into our stomachs cup by cup.

Suddenly remembering something, he asked me,

"Are you married?"

"No," I said with a bitter smile.

"Then, at least a little romance?"

I still shook my head at him. He seemed very disappointed. It was as if he was saying, how have I been spending these days?

I asked him in return: "What about you?"

Hearing my question, a layer of 　 brilliant light swept across his face. His tone seemed to be 　cheerful as well. He looked very satisfied 　.

"I can't be like you. I'm already married, and soon we'll be having a baby!" Saying that, he took out a photo from his pocket and said:

"Here, I'll give it to you! Look, my wife is pretty good, right? Two big eyes. We've known each other for three years. She's still in college."

"A happy man," I toasted him, and he quickly took it and drank it all in one gulp.

His temperament was still so cheerful. He laughed heartily after drinking a lot of wine, and told me in a low voice.

"Even here, although it was only a few days, I had a little romance. That woman was really cute, but later she heard that I was married and ignored me."

"Aren't you afraid your wife will be sad when she finds out?"

"Oh, that's nothing. We are very good. This is just acting on the stage. After so many years, everything has changed, but this old temper has not changed."

His words made us both laugh—I said to him:

"You haven't changed at all, you're still the same."

"You too."

This seemed to be our final mutual discovery. It was already very late. There were only a few people left in the tavern. We slipped onto the street. A gust of cold wind blew head-on, freezing people so that they shivered. We almost said at the same time:

"It's really cold."

### Mr. Tang Shouqing of Yushan's Figure Paintings

— Wen Zhaotong

When it comes to Chinese figure painting, it seems that one immediately thinks of the "Cao clothing emerging from the water, Wu ribbons dancing in the wind" style of the ancient masters, with their brilliant styles. However, this style can only be understood from historical legends.

If we want to take a look at the works of the late Tang dynasty, such as Zhang Xuan's paintings of noble sons, Zhou 　's paintings of beautiful women, or Li Gonglin's white depictions of the Song dynasty, it is not easy to do so. Therefore, if one wants to explore the style of Chinese figure painting, perhaps one can only study the works of the masters of the Ming and Qing dynasties.

Examining the paintings of the Song and Yuan dynasties and earlier, figure paintings were mostly dominated by Taoist and Buddhist themes. It was not until the Ming dynasty that we could see three trends: Taoist and Buddhist, historical customs, and portraiture. However, as for the Taoist and Buddhist category, Xu Qin said in his "Ming Dynasty Painting Records": "Modern masters can neither specialize in this field, but falsely claim that they disdain it. Confucian temples and Buddhist monasteries are full of vulgar paintings, and there is nothing worth seeing." This is precisely pointing out its fate. Historical customs, on the other hand, were very developed, and Qiu Shizhou was a representative writer. He was not only beautiful, charming, meticulous, and exquisite, but also used ancient methods in many ways, with originality. The Southern Chen and Northern Cui of the late Ming dynasty were also great masters. Chen Hongshou's style tended towards strangeness and antiquity, while Cui Zizhong pursued lofty elegance, establishing a solid foundation for the style of the Ren brothers of the Qing dynasty. As for portraiture, Zeng Bochen of Minzhong was the representative at that time. Although it was still popular in the Qing dynasty, it lacked the unique artistic charm of China.

During the three hundred years of the Qing dynasty, the development of figure painting was really only in the category of historical customs. Within this category, we can further divide it into two major sections, namely, customs and stories, and ladies. The former was still centered on the style of Qiu Ying and Chen Cui. The Qiu school was most popular during the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods, and later developed into independent paintings of ladies. The works of Gai Qixiang and Fei Xiaolou during the Daoguang and Xianfeng periods were pure, elegant, and detached from the world, and can be truly regarded as excellent. The latter reached its peak in the late Qing dynasty.

Mr. Tang Shouqing of Wu Yu is a loyal writer who loves the art of figure painting. He spent more than 20 years of his efforts, just in the style of modern figure painting center under hard work, often to Qiu, Gai, Fei, the scale of the home to find clues, hard thinking, imitation, carefully set ink, carefully color, in these many precious time, accumulated these works, on the style, not only beautiful, but also elegant, not only meticulous, but also rigorous, is an artistic worshiper, we to his first exhibition in the youth association, should be given another look.

### At the End of the Year of Yimao, I Traveled with Friends on the French Riviera for Five Days, Sending My Sentiments to Shi Zhaoji in Paris

— Jin Wensi

Kunming Pond has changed and the bamboo forest is joyful, the gatherings and dispersions are hasty, almost like orchids; the waves on the beach are vast and powerful, the palm trees fall in the sunset, the sea and mountains are cold. I cherish Liu Yi's ambition on the distant bed, and I beg to place the common people under Xie An's care; the victory or defeat of the remaining chess game is the responsibility of both, I look forward to working hard and urging you to add to your meal.

### Rhyming in Response to Envoy Jin Wensi

— Shi Zhao

How can five days of lingering be all joy? I know that you regret the parting as the year comes to an end; the rivers and mountains are still beautiful in the smoke and clouds, the vast sea is turbulent and the wind and snow are cold. I still have a letter to comfort me, and I still pity the lonely traveler in Chang'an; when will I meet you again? Don't laugh at people's talk about eating a free meal.

### Double Flying (17)

— Zhao Qingge

(6)

Old Mr. Weng not only predicted what happened to Mr. Mo, but also predicted what happened to himself. In the same winter that Mrs. Mo gave birth to Lihua, Mrs. Weng II also gave birth to a daughter. Moreover, his daughter and Mr. Mo's daughter, as expected, became good friends, just like their mothers. Because of this, his daughter's name was also given to her by Mr. Mo, called Liyun.

Mr. Mo blushed with shame, and he slapped the table hard, wanting to say something, but swallowed it back.

"Besides, boys should study, that's right; what's the use of girls studying? Anyway, you don't have good intentions, you just want to find a way to bully me." Mrs. Mo said, and also slapped the table hard.

The children felt very uneasy and also ridiculous because of their parents' quarrel! At the same time, it could not reduce the children's closeness to Mr. Mo, and they naturally needed to be with Mr. Mo often, because their desire for knowledge could not be satisfied by Mrs. Mo.

Mr. Mo was proud of this, and he was happy for this pride! He had never had this kind of experience in his life. Because he had never had anything in his life that was worth being proud of.

"Shaohua, I'm really happy! You don't ignore me because of your mother."

After Mr. Mo quarreled with Mrs. Mo, Mrs. Mo forcibly pulled Lihua away from Mr. Mo, but in the blink of an eye, Lihua quietly returned to Mr. Mo's side. Therefore, Mr. Mo said to 　hua with relief.

Lihua smiled and leaned against Mr. Mo, without saying anything.

Mr. Mo hugged Lihua tightly. A wave of victorious joy made him forget the unhappiness just now, and even forget the worries of the past years. He told Lihua a story about a dream. He told the story of the strange dream he had seven years ago, the night before Lihua was born, in a vivid and colorful way.

Lihua listened quietly, like listening to an interesting myth. She didn't understand what this myth had to do with her, and she never thought that this myth faintly foretold her life.

Finally, Mr. Mo made a conclusion on Old Mr. Weng's explanation. He fondly stroked Lihua's head and said:

"What your Uncle Weng said was completely accurate. You and I, father and daughter, are indeed destined! You really like Daddy. You smiled the first time you saw Daddy! You are really the apple of Daddy's eye!"

Lihua smiled again. This time, she burst out laughing! Because of her laughter, Mr. Mo recalled the memory of seven years ago—she laughed the same way as when she had just landed on the ground, she laughed like the clear singing of the oriole in the dream!

### Responding to Readers

(Question) Where to Study Russian? I am a university student who is about to graduate. After graduation, I plan to go to work in the Northeast or Xinjiang, so Russian seems to be very necessary for me. My school does not offer Russian classes. I don't know if there is any place in the city that specializes in teaching Russian? Please reply so that I can learn abroad. Sincerely, Le Jingzong

(Answer) Minzhi Middle School has a Russian language specialization class, which you can attend. The school address is at the intersection of Chongqing South Road and Pushi Road.

It is best to have a training class for agricultural technicians for those who are interested in learning. I don't know where there is a training class now. Please tell me as a thank you. Respectfully, Fuhua

(Answer) St. John's University and Nantong College in this city have departments of agriculture, but there are no training classes for technicians. If you are interested in agriculture, you can first purchase agricultural books, study on your own, and then ask experts for guidance.

(Question) When Will My Son, Who Suffered Disaster, Be Released? My son, Wu Songtao, engaged in underground work during the war. On April 7 of the year, he was captured by enemy military police detectives and sent to the Zhenjiang military police branch, detained for ten days, and sent to the Nanjing military police headquarters. He was sentenced in June of the second year, and there was a sentence letter, but it has been seven years since then. It has been half a year since the victory, but there is still no news. I don't know if he has sacrificed for the country. The truth is unknown. Please give me guidance and tell me where to appeal? To be released, I beg for a reply. 　Gratefully, Wu Jiaju, parent of the afflicted.

(Answer) This case should be entrusted to a lawyer or a public organization should be asked to come forward to the Nanjing District Court, Military Police Department, to find out the truth and ask for release.

(Question) Can an Abortion Be Performed After Two Months of Pregnancy? If a pregnant woman has been pregnant for two months, will using medicine to abort the fetus affect future fertility and lifelong fertility? Zhang Renqi, Zhenjiang
