### National Assembly's Sixth Meeting: Pan Gongzhan, Zhang Zhiben, and Others Vigorously Criticize the Constitution Draft

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] The National Assembly held its sixth meeting on December 2nd, continuing the broad exchange of views on the constitution draft. The meeting commenced at 10:25 AM with the ringing of a bell. Deputy Secretary-General Lei reported that 1,615 delegates had registered, with 1,179 in attendance, meeting the legal quorum. Chairman Bai Chongxi then led the customary ceremony. After the reporting officer praised the minutes of the previous meeting, Chairman Bai announced the start of the constitution draft discussion, requesting delegates to maintain order in the meeting venue and speak in turn. Yang Youjiong and 13 other delegates then expressed their opinions, which are recorded as follows:

Yang Youjiong, a delegate from Hunan, argued that direct democracy should include provisions for all four powers. Chapter Twelve, "Elections," in the constitution draft should be expanded to "Direct Democracy I," adding the three powers of recall, initiative, and referendum.

He Xinghan, a delegate from Hunan, advocated for the deletion of the first and second clauses of Article 26 regarding the Legislative and Supervisory Committee members being National Assembly delegates. Instead, he proposed adding vocational elections in addition to regional elections to clearly delineate the division of political and governing powers.

Yang Yifeng, a vocational representative from Henan, argued for establishing the capital in Beijing, citing four reasons: "(1) From a national defense perspective, our national defense will inevitably be in the north for decades to come. Distant attacks are less effective than close defense, and being close to the border allows for constant vigilance. (2) The Father of the Nation's teachings do not explicitly state that the capital should be in Nanjing. The initial desire for Yuan Shikai to go to Nanjing was a strategic move. (3) The distinct northern climate is beneficial to the physical and mental development of the people. (4) Whether to move the capital or not should not be a calculation of mere relocation costs. The construction of Nanjing and the desolation of Beijing must be taken into account."

Pan Gongzhan, a specially selected delegate, questioned five aspects of the constitution draft amendment: "(1) Regarding the nation's territory, can it be altered with just a few legislators raising their hands? (2) The people's political power needs protection and strength to safeguard civil rights and control the government. If this constitution draft is adopted, will we have any political power to exercise in our lifetimes? (3) Will directly administered municipalities have National Assembly delegates? Why isn't this stipulated in the constitution? (4) The powers of the central and local governments are enumerated. In case of disputes, Article 113 states that the Legislative Yuan will resolve them. Is the Legislative Yuan a central or local organ? Is it more reasonable to have one side enumerate and the other summarize? (5) The status of directly administered municipalities is decided by the Legislative Yuan. Is there a desire to establish directly administered municipalities, or is there an intention to obliterate them?"

Wang Yin, a delegate from Chahar, argued that political and governing powers should be clearly delineated to avoid friction between governing organs and reduce administrative effectiveness.

Chen Guyuan, a specially selected delegate, raised five technical contradictions in the constitution draft amendment: "(1) The date for constitutional implementation is stipulated to be determined by law, but according to Article 146, laws must be passed by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated by the President to be established. Without a President, who will announce the date for constitutional implementation? (2) Should the power to discipline civil servants under Article 85 and Article 103 belong to the judiciary or the Supervisory Yuan? The constitution should clearly define this. (3) The wording of Article 1 is cumbersome and unintelligible. 'Government of the people, by the people, for the people' is democracy. It is too repetitive. Why not simply state 'A democratic republic based on the Three Principles of the People'? (4) Regarding the powers of the Legislative Yuan, the Political Consultative Conference resolution only stated that it is 'equivalent' to the 'parliament' of general democratic countries, not that it 'is.' The constitution draft amendment exceeds this, obliterating the Five-Power Constitution and the division of powers. This is inappropriate."

Jian Boqun, a women's representative, stated: "(1) The National Assembly should have the opportunity to assist the President. (2) The Legislative Yuan has too much power. (3) The provisions in the Chapter on Basic National Policies are too general, hasty, and vague and should be clearly listed in separate chapters." She argued that the constitution should be rigid and all-encompassing.

Xiao Zheng, a specially selected delegate, stated that the constitutions of various countries in the 18th and 19th centuries focused on political aspects, while this century has begun to focus on economic aspects. The constitution draft amendment is insufficient to protect the people's livelihood. The national economic system should be supplemented and listed as a separate chapter. The land system should refer to the "May 5th" constitution draft and be stipulated in detail.

Ma Xuchang, a representative of the liberal professions, argued for more proactive provisions on the writ of habeas corpus. Zhou Fuchang, a representative from Kang District, stated that the central government organ is called the "National Assembly," and the provincial government organs should change "Provincial People's Representative Assembly" to "Provincial People's Assembly" to maintain consistency.

Yu Wangde, a specially selected delegate, stated that when the President of the Executive Yuan exercises his powers, he is constantly hampered by the Legislative Yuan, which runs contrary to the principle of "capable government."

By this point, it was 12:00 noon. Chairman Bai, responding to the request of the assembly, reported that the meeting would continue at 3:00 PM in the afternoon and then adjourned the meeting.

### Afternoon Session Continues: Delegates Speak Enthusiastically

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] The National Assembly's sixth general assembly continued at 3:30 PM on the 2nd, with 1,107 delegates in attendance. Delegates continued to freely express their opinions. Yan Guofu, Sun Yichang, Liu Hengjing, Zou Bingwen, Lou Tongseng, He Shi, Chen Changheng, Chen Zifeng, Xie Chengping, Wen Shiyuan, and others successively delivered speeches. A 15-minute break was taken from 4:55 PM to 5:10 PM. The general assembly adjourned at 6:00 PM. The important opinions of the delegates are recorded below:

Yan Guofu: "(1) We should study the constitution draft submitted by the National Government to make it more progressive. (2) Regarding central and local autonomy, the central government includes the five Yuans, and local autonomy includes provinces, counties, and Mongolian-Tibetan areas. (3) The people have four powers, but the National Assembly delegates do not. The National Assembly should have provisions for exercising the four powers. (4) The President's term of office should be changed to four years, with the possibility of reelection."

Sun Yichang: Chapter Three of the constitution draft, "National Assembly Delegates," should add vocational groups and women's groups to participate in the election.

Liu Hengjing: A good constitution should ensure that it can realize good ideals on the one hand and adapt to reality on the other. I believe that political power should be able to control governing power, and constitutional government should be politics for all the people. The constitution draft should be amended in the following two aspects: "(1) The National Assembly should have the power to elect legislators and supervisors. (2) The rights of farmers, workers, and women should be specially protected."

Zou Bingwen: "(1) We should explore the principle of balance for ordinary farmers. (2) Constitutional implementation is not what we advocate, but after the meeting, a transitional measure should still be adopted."

He Shi: The basic spirit is democracy, and the composition should be strengthened. A system of checks and balances should be established between governing power and political power. In Chapter Three, the National Assembly has no political power other than electing the President, so the people cannot control the government.

Lou Tongseng: "(1) The National Government has made great contributions to leading the Northern Expedition and persevering in the War of Resistance, so the status of the National Government should be added to the constitution. The most fundamental aspect of the ideal of a world commonwealth lies in economic stability, which then provides the strength to realize the ideal of an omnipotent government. (2) The Executive Yuan being responsible to the Legislative Yuan can cause a crisis for the Executive Yuan at any time, leading to a crisis of political instability."

Chen Changheng: Constitutional drafting should be based on the four virtues of "impartiality," "righteousness," "sincerity," and "clarity" to create a good constitution. My opinions are as follows: Article One should be changed to "The Republic of China is a republic based on the Three Principles of the People." Article Two, "The sovereignty of the Republic of China belongs to the entire people," should be changed to "The entire nation." Chapter Three, "National Assembly Delegates," should add vocational representatives and women's representatives. Chapter Four, "Functions and Powers of the National Assembly," should add the power to recall legislators and supervisors. Chapters Eight and Nine should add a chapter on the central government. Chapter Seven, "Judicial Yuan," should add a vice president. Chapter Nine, "Supervisory Committee," has too many members. Chapter Eleven, "Provincial and County Systems," should add a Mongolian-Tibetan system. Chapter Fourteen, "Basic National Policies," should be divided into chapters.

Fang Qingru: The Chapter on Elections places restrictions on the age of electors and those being elected. I wonder if the provincial governor and mayor are also subject to these provisions.

Qian Changzuo: The Chapter on Basic National Policies, Economics, Education, and Diplomacy should be separated.

Guo Heng: The National Government completed the Northern Expedition and the War of Resistance and is a capable government, which should be stipulated in the constitution.

Li Jiangqiu: The capital should be established in Beijing.

Xie Chengping: Establish a vocational representative election system. Even conservative Britain and Japan have vocational representatives. Legislators are connected to all aspects of society. If elections are held by province, there should be at least one person, which can solve the people's livelihood needs and lay the foundation for strengthening economic democracy. Secondly, the Chapter on Basic National Policies should strengthen national education to realize the ideals of government of the people, by the people, for the people and achieve the ideals of the Premier.

Yi Tuyuan: Article One, "Government of the people, by the people, for the people," should be abolished and changed to "The Republic of China is a democratic republic based on the Three Principles of the People." Article Seven should confirm the establishment of the capital in Beijing. Articles Eleven to Fifteen, regarding provisions for autonomy, should state that "it shall not be restricted by law." Article 24, which confirms that in certain circumstances, it can "be protected by the constitution," is contradictory. We believe that relative freedom should be adopted. Articles Eleven to Fifteen should remain the same. Article 24 should add the phrase "in situations that endanger national security" as a restriction. Article 149, "The interpretation of the constitution shall be made by the Judicial Yuan," should be interpreted by a special agency. We advocate that a certain number of people be established within the National Assembly, with the addition of one or three legislators, to specialize in interpreting the constitution. Article 147, the listed attached items should be cancelled.

### Chiang Kai-shek: Outstanding Leader Guiding China Towards Democracy, Washington Post Comments on Our National Assembly

[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st] The Washington Post commented today that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is truly the most outstanding Chinese political leader of the present era and can make the National Assembly the beginning of China's genuine democratic development. Only by establishing genuine democracy can the immense potential of the Chinese people be fully realized, and then China can step onto the path of democracy. The newspaper hopes that the National Assembly can carefully examine the constitution draft so that it can become a genuine and feasible democratic constitution to the extent that conditions permit. It believes that the current progress of the National Assembly is of great significance and gratifying.

### President Sun Fo Talks to Reporters: Peace Talks Can Resume at Any Time; Argues That It Is Advisable Not to Move the Capital

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] When President Sun Fo answered questions at a reception for Chinese and foreign journalists at the Central Propaganda Department on the 2nd, he said that peace talks can resume at any time. From the government's perspective, the door to negotiations has not been closed. Regarding rumors that the government will be reorganized during the National Assembly meeting, he had not heard of them. As for whether the Communists will participate in the reorganized government, his view is that if they are willing to participate, there is no problem. A reporter asked his opinion on whether the capital should be in Nanjing or Beijing. Sun Fo believes that since the capital has already been established in Nanjing, it would be advisable not to move the capital unless there is a particularly serious reason, as the relocation of the capital is not an easy matter. During the War of Resistance, we chose Chongqing as the capital out of necessity. Now that we have returned to Nanjing, unless there is an unavoidable accident, I believe that it should not be changed casually. As for whether the location of the capital should be explicitly stipulated in the constitution, Sun Fo's view is that if the issue of establishing the capital has not been disputed, it is acceptable for the constitution not to explicitly stipulate it. Now that a problem has occurred, if it is not explicitly stipulated in the constitution, people's hearts will easily be shaken, and it will be enough to affect work. Therefore, he advocates that the constitution should have provisions for the capital.

### National Assembly Delegates Have No Term of Office

In addition to answering the above questions, President Sun Fo also answered questions about the National Assembly and the constitution draft. The important points are as follows:

Question: A small number of delegates in the National Assembly are brewing the issue of constitutional implementation. I hope the President can explain this movement.

Answer: This question should be raised to those who are brewing this movement, as I have not participated in this issue.

### Youth Party Establishment Anniversary: Special Reception for Chinese and Foreign Journalists to Explain the Party's History and Political Views

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] The 2nd was the 23rd anniversary of the establishment of the Chinese Youth Party. The party held a press conference at the lounge of the National Assembly Hall at 1:30 PM in the afternoon to report on the party's history and political views. More than 200 Chinese and foreign journalists attended. The party's Secretary-General Chen Qitian presided over the meeting. In addition to the report, he also answered questions from reporters. The meeting ended at about 2:00 PM. In the evening, the Youth Party held a dinner party at Kangle Garden, which was attended by more than 100 people, which was a grand event. The main points of Chen Qitian's speech are as follows: Today is the 23rd anniversary of the establishment of our party. The National Assembly delegates of our party take this opportunity to welcome you and briefly report our party's propositions: A. The Youth Party was established on December 2, 1923, and has been fighting for democratic politics for 23 years. B. The Youth Party has three fundamentals: (1) Nationalism, (2) Democratic Politics, (3) Social Legislation. C. Objectives: To create a modern national state with full welfare for all the people internally and to promote a peaceful world of equality and cooperation externally. D. Characteristics: (1) Neutrality, (2) Constructiveness.

Question: Will the term of office of National Assembly delegates be extended until the date of constitutional implementation begins?

Answer: According to the National Assembly Organizational Law, the task of this National Assembly is only to formulate a constitution and determine the date of constitutional implementation. The term of office of the delegates will end when the task is completed, and the delegates have no term of office.

### Explanation of the Two Powers of the National Assembly

Question: Today, some people in the general assembly believe that the powers of the National Assembly in the constitution draft are too small, while the powers of the Legislative Yuan are too large. The President is an authority on this issue and is expected to provide an explanation.

Answer: This is a question of interpretation, which cannot be explained in a few words. According to the constitution draft, the National Assembly has two powers, namely, to elect and recall the President and Vice President, to initiate constitutional amendments, and to re-decide on amendments to the constitution proposed by the Legislative Yuan. Generally, people believe that the powers of the National Assembly are too small, or because the "May 5th" constitution draft stipulates that in addition to electing and recalling the President and Vice President, the National Assembly may also appoint and dismiss the presidents and vice presidents of the Legislative Yuan and Supervisory Yuan, as well as legislators and supervisors. At that time, other parties opposed this provision at the Political Consultative Conference. In my view, the four powers exercised by the people are direct civil rights, and the National Assembly is composed of representatives elected by the people. Therefore, what it exercises is only indirect civil rights. According to progressive theory, the President, President of the Legislative Yuan, and President of the Supervisory Yuan should be directly elected by the people, which can be called direct civil rights. China's situation is complex. The election and recall of the President of the Legislative Yuan and the President of the Supervisory Yuan, if all elected by the National Assembly composed of three or four thousand people, may not work. Therefore, there are such alternative methods: the people elect National Assembly delegates, and the National Assembly delegates replace the people in electing or recalling the President and Vice President, while other civil servants are elected by other methods. If all important officials are elected by the National Assembly, not to mention the time involved, it will create a phenomenon of the National Assembly monopolizing national civil rights, which is not in line with the most progressive system of modern times.

Question: Is it true that the proposed amendment to the constitution draft at this National Assembly violates the spirit of the Five-Power Constitution?

Answer: This statement is not entirely accurate. The reason why such a misunderstanding has occurred is because they have not thoroughly studied the constitution draft and have not been able to distinguish the meaning of political power and governing power. Governing power is the power entrusted by the people to handle matters. The Five Yuans are entrusted by the people to handle affairs and should be governing power. However, those who exercise governing power may also exercise political power. For example, civil servants can not only exercise governing power. During elections, civil servants can also vote as citizens, and their right to vote is not deprived because they are civil servants. For example, there are many National Assembly delegates who are also civil servants and can exercise both political power and governing power at the same time. It is completely incomprehensible to say that after exercising governing power, one cannot exercise political power. The general public has a wrong understanding because of unclear concepts.

### Provisions on Treaties for Territorial Changes

Question: According to Article Four of the constitution draft, the territory of the Republic of China shall not be changed without law. The general public has expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that territory can be changed according to law. What explanation does the President have for this?

Answer: Changes in territory are usually stipulated by treaties. For example, Taiwan was originally occupied by Japan. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the country was restored, and Taiwan rejoined our territory. However, the "legalization" of this matter still requires the formal signing of a peace treaty, and the peace treaty must be approved by the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process before it can be established. Therefore, the constitution draft has the provision that "it shall not be changed without law."

Question: Will the constitution draft be greatly modified when it is reviewed by the National Assembly?

Answer: This is not yet known and will be known after the review.

Question: According to the National Assembly Organizational Law, the session of the National Assembly is set for ten to twenty days, which may be extended if necessary. Should the extension of the session be announced by the National Government, or can the National Assembly itself announce the extension, and can it be extended indefinitely?

Answer: The extension of the National Assembly session belongs to the National Assembly itself. It seems unlikely that it will be extended indefinitely.

Question: How many days will the National Assembly be in recess?

Answer: The constitution draft review committee has been established in groups and can start the review work. During the review process, the general assembly will be suspended for about ten days. The date of the recess has not been decided.

Question: What is the President's view on the fact that the Youth Party did not attend the supplementary swearing-in ceremony at the National Assembly the other day?

Answer: I did not hear the explanation made by the Youth Party on this (reporter's note: the Youth Party held a press conference at the same place before the press conference of the Central Propaganda Department).

### A Sketch of the Sixth National Assembly

— Our Reporters: Pu Dejie, Zhang Ming

The sixth session of the National Assembly was the most peaceful session since it began. Before noon, Chairman Bai Chongxi repeatedly reminded the representatives to speak at the podium and to maintain order. Lei Zhen arranged the order of speakers to his left, while Hong Lanyou sat quietly to his right, resting. The first presidium was invited twice, but no one went up.

Despite the peaceful atmosphere, there was no shortage of brilliant speeches. The speeches of Yang Yifeng, Pan Gongzhan, Chen Guyuan, and Zhang Zhiben were all listened to attentively by the audience and received much applause. Besides those speakers, most of the representatives did not listen, but were either chatting or reading newspapers. When Di Ying and Zhang Mojun were discussing matters, Zhang took out his recent work, which Di praised greatly. Ma Xingye proofread his Central Daily News, reading Xu Zhaochang's article "Nanjing in the Ming Dynasty" from the "Mountain and Sea" section, word by word, from beginning to end. Hu Shi once strode out slowly and then slowly strode back. Everyone was writing freely.

Yang Yifeng, a representative from Henan, began his speech by saying, "There are two proposals regarding the location of the capital: one is Nanjing, and the other is Beiping. I advocate for Beiping to be the capital!" His concise and straightforward statement immediately earned him thunderous applause. He then listed four reasons, each of which was met with a round of applause. The reporters in the press area also cheered, "Go to Beiping!" The wave of support for making Beiping the capital flowed through everyone's heart.

Pan Gongzhan, a specially-invited representative, spoke first, raising five questions about the draft constitution amendment, two of which concerned special municipalities. He said, "I come from Shanghai, and I want to ask on behalf of the citizens of Shanghai, is there still a need for special municipalities in the administrative system? If so, will special municipalities elect representatives to the National Assembly? And how can the status of special municipalities be determined by the Legislative Yuan? These should all be clearly stipulated in the constitution." This immediately sparked enthusiastic applause, and the photographers from various Shanghai newspapers all rushed forward.

Chen Guyuan, a specially-invited representative, began by saying, "I dare not say the word 'constitutional rule' because I am afraid it will cause 'division'. However, there are contradictory points in the draft constitutional amendment, and there are many other technical problems. The wording, sentence arrangement, and all aspects are lacking." He then gave examples, one by one. Each example received a round of applause, echoing Yang Yifeng's earlier speech, proving his worth as a legislator.

Zhang Zhiben, a specially-invited representative, is an old legal scholar. As soon as he stepped onto the podium, he received a warm welcome. He said, "The constitution we are about to create must have three conditions: progress, perfection, and rationality. The current draft constitutional amendment, in a nutshell, is a makeshift. But this is a matter of a hundred years, and it must not be treated as a makeshift..." (thunderous applause). He also said, "We must not use 'the people's level is not high enough' as an excuse to deprive the people of their political power. In the world, only the government's level is not high enough, not the people's. Great undertakings are all accomplished by the power of the people. For example, the government is the driver of a car, and the people are the passengers. Only the driver has the issue of level—whether they can drive or not. There is no issue of level for the passengers, saying whether they know how to sit or not." The applause was thunderous. Time was up, but the old man's words were not finished. According to the rules, he apologized and wanted to step down, but the audience said, "Keep talking, keep talking!" Di Ying took the agenda and stood up, waving it, "Please continue to finish!" Chairman Bai immediately agreed to extend the time. Only after the old man finished speaking did he step down amidst applause.

Li Zhengle, a representative from the Sui District, with graying temples, spoke with passion, shaking his head and gesticulating. Expressing his views on the Mongolian banner system, he said, "Speaking of the Sui District alone, we not only do not discriminate against our Mongolian compatriots, but we have also tried our best to treat them favorably. The number of provincial councilors is proportionally higher for Mongolians than for Han Chinese, and the burden of paying taxes and grain is less for Mongolians than for Han Chinese. I advocate that the administrative system should not have a dual track." The Mongolian representatives did not react. The Eighth Review Committee of the Constitutional Draft, which specializes in reviewing the Mongolian and Tibetan local systems, has already been established, and they have already achieved victory.

The morning session continued without a break. At exactly twelve o'clock, the representatives said, "Time is up." Chairman Bai then announced that the discussion would be suspended and the session would continue in the afternoon. Deputy Secretary-General Lei announced that the Youth Party would hold a press reception tea party in celebration of its founding anniversary, moving from the Overseas Chinese Reception Center to the representatives' lounge of the National Assembly Hall at 1:30 PM. The press reception of the Central Propaganda Department will be held at 2:00 PM in the lounge on the second floor of the Assembly Hall. The reporters, who were worried about being in two places at once, breathed a sigh of relief and smiled.

When the labor union representatives requested that the National Assembly add a clause for professional groups, they also made this request for women's groups, and thunderous applause erupted from the women's representatives' seats. At the same time, it spread to the entire venue. This was the most brilliant speech of the afternoon session.

Liu Hengjing, the female chairperson of the presidium, stepped up to speak today with an extremely composed demeanor, giving all the representatives a considerable sense of respect. She spoke after Representative Sun, and so, while fighting for rights, she also made a special mention of the rights of farmers and workers. This response was the best. (December 2nd)

### National Army Advances to Vicinity of Dalian; Communist Army Begins Dismantling Factory Machinery; Rumor Has It That Zhu De Has Gone to the Soviet Union on an Important Mission

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 2nd] Sources from relevant authorities report: After entering Wafangdian, the National Army on the Liaodong Peninsula proceeded to enter Putudian on the 29th. This location is less than 100 li from Dalian.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 2nd] A dispatch from Beiping states: The Chinese Communist Party is dismantling twelve large and small ordnance factories and heavy industrial facilities in Dalian and transporting them to the Shandong Peninsula. Ninety percent of the materials to be shipped have already been dispatched.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 2nd] According to a gentleman who escaped from Dalian to Shenyang yesterday: The Communist army in Dalian is now concentrated at around 150,000 men, mostly from Shandong. Those from the Northeast are being sent to Shandong Province. In addition to the machinery previously dismantled by the Soviets, the Communist army is now also beginning to dismantle factory machinery and concentrate grain and forage. However, the army lacks guns and ammunition. The Communist army is now taking direct action on propaganda and organization, with many slogans such as "The New Chinese Father of the Nation, Marshal Stalin" posted on the streets.

[United Press, Beiping, 2nd] Northeast Communist Army Commander Lin Biao today accepted the US proposal to establish a US inspection team at his headquarters in Harbin. However, due to too many attached conditions, sources close to certain knowledgeable quarters claim that the Executive Headquarters has expressed dissatisfaction. One of the most stringent conditions is that US personnel are not allowed to use their own wireless equipment. The US representatives to the Executive Headquarters suggested establishing an inspection team in Harbin after the executive groups of the Headquarters withdrew from the Communist-controlled areas of Qiqihar, Lafa, and Shuangcheng in the Northeast. The withdrawal of the groups was due to Lin Biao's claim that he could not guarantee their safety.

[United Press, Nanjing, 2nd] According to unconfirmed reports from the government today, Communist Army Commander-in-Chief Zhu De went to Moscow on November 20 on an important military mission. It is unknown when he will return. The Chinese Communists are purchasing large quantities of goods in the "Liberated Areas" in preparation for exchanging them for Soviet military equipment.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 2nd] It is said that Ye Jianying flew to Harbin to discuss the establishment of liaison personnel in Harbin, according to people from the Communist Party in the Executive Headquarters. Local people believe that this is a false statement, and that Ye's departure must have been entrusted with an important mission. It is rumored here that Mao Zedong is in Harbin, and it is speculated that Ye's trip is related to Marshal Ma's arrival in Beiping. In addition, his assistant Huang Hua secretly returned to Yan'an on the 27th, and returned on the same day. He publicly declared to reporters in Beiping that women and children had been evacuated from Yan'an and that they were actively preparing for war.

### Communist Army Plans to Flee to Southern Jiangsu; Communist Political Commissar of Northern Jiangsu Returns from Northeast; Orders Troops to Adopt Guerrilla and Flanking Tactics

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 2nd] According to reliable sources: Jin Zhanen, the Communist political commissar of northern Jiangsu, recently returned from the Northeast and immediately ordered his troops to adopt guerrilla and flanking tactics to avoid frontal battles with the National Army. If the National Army launches a full-scale counterattack in northern Jiangsu, they plan to abandon northern Jiangsu as much as possible and flee to southern Jiangsu in order to seize opportunities and threaten the capital.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 2nd] The highway from Huaiyin to Siyang was destroyed by the Communist army in late November, making it impassable. It is now being actively repaired by the National Army and civilians, and traffic has resumed as normal.

[Our Taixian Dispatch, 1st] This reporter followed Commander Li into Caoyan early this morning. All the highway bridges north of Dingxi were destroyed by the Communist army. This reporter walked with the commander to the area. Along the way, people returning to their hometowns were coming and going in an endless stream. The residents did their best to assist in transportation when the National Army entered, and welcomed the arrival of the National Army with extremely excited expressions.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 2nd] Military news: As of the 30th of last month, the Communist army on the outskirts of Lianghuai and within the borders of Suxuisi has switched to a defensive posture due to repeated setbacks in their offensives. After the National Army reopened the Xuhuai Highway, the situation completely changed. It is reported that the Communist army in northern Jiangsu, Zhang Aiping's unit and Li Yu's unit, suffered losses of more than five divisions and more than two thousand officers and soldiers were captured. It is impossible to replenish them in a short time. It is expected that the war situation in northern Jiangsu will have a decisive development within the next week. The recovered areas of northern Jiangsu are exempt from corvée, military service, and taxes, which has become a reality. The field grain divisions and field grain sections of Lianghuai, Su, Si, Xu, Gao, Bao, Xing, and Dong counties have not yet been established. It is also reported that during this transition period, the county governments are able to respect the central government's intentions and have not arbitrarily levied grain taxes or apportioned tasks. However, the general public hopes that the central government will issue an early decree exempting taxes and postponing the conscription of strongmen, so that they can return to their hometowns with peace of mind to make a living.

### The Northeast Is the Most Prosperous in the World; Abundant Agricultural Products, Many Mineral Deposits, Convenient Transportation; Sun Yueqi Reported to Reporters Yesterday

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] Sun Yueqi, Deputy Chairman of the Resources Committee, attended a press conference of the Central Propaganda Department at about 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd, reporting on the transportation and mineral resources in the Northeast. Minister Peng first gave a brief introduction, saying that Sun was the "Coal King" of China and had traveled all over the Northeast in recent years, and was extremely familiar with the transportation and mineral resources of the area. Then, Sun pointed to the large map and gave a general introduction to the Northeast, saying that the Northeast is the most prosperous area in China, and its prosperity is unparalleled anywhere in the world. The Northeast is not only rich in agricultural products on the ground, but also has many mineral deposits underground, and what is even more rare is that there are many good harbors, which are extremely convenient for import and export. Sun then described the territory and river transportation of the Northeast. When talking about the construction of railways, he solemnly pointed out that the occurrence of the September 18 Incident was mainly due to the success of our railway policy in the Northeast. On the eve of the Northeast Incident, the railways we built not only connected the three northeastern provinces, but also surrounded the Chinese Eastern and South Manchurian Railways. Moreover, our Huludao Port was more convenient than the Russian and Japanese ports of Vladivostok, which led to the Japanese invasion. At present, there are six major railway hubs in the Northeast, namely Jinzhou, Shenyang, Sipingjie, Changchun, Harbin, and Jiamusi. In terms of industry, before September 18, our country used three agricultural products to establish three industries, namely oil mills for squeezing soybeans, flour mills for grinding wheat, and distilleries for refining sorghum. There are two main minerals in the Northeast, namely coal and iron. The former had an annual output of 25.5 million tons before the victory. There are eight major mining areas, including Beipiao, Fuxin, Fushun, and Benxihu. The main iron mines are Anshan, Muxi Lake, and Tonghua, all located in the south. In terms of electricity, there are four major power plants in total. One plant is hydroelectric, and the other two are thermal power. The total power generation capacity is 2 million kilowatts, and the total length of power lines reaches 12,000 kilometers.

### Communist Party Covets the Great Northwest; Publishes Article Addressed to All Party Members; Conspires to Destroy the Entire Social Economy

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 2nd] In order to launch a full-scale treason, partition the border areas, and covet the Great Northwest, the Northwest Bureau of the Communist Party recently published an article addressed to all members of the Communist Party. A summary of its contents is as follows: (1) In order to defeat the government army and establish a communist New China, we must defend the border areas and liberate the Great Northwest. (2) The Northwest occupies one-third of the country's area and is an area of mutual assistance between the three democratic countries of China, [missing characters]. Therefore, our army must first depart from the northern Qian, control Jianlin, and another unit must advance towards Yimeng to echo each other; (3) The northern line has already conquered important strongholds on the periphery in the first phase, and is currently carrying out the second phase, eliminating Fu Zuoyi's troops, eliminating obstacles in the northwest, and preparing to launch the third phase; (4) In order to develop the Great Northwest plan and control the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia and Jin-Sui border areas, we must quickly change the overall strategy and resolutely take the initiative to attack. The consolidation and expansion of the two border areas include Inner Mongolia, Suiyuan, Baotou, Ningxia, Lanzhou, so as to develop into a central base for the two liberated area regimes; (5) To accomplish the above tasks, we can only cooperate with the main force to launch large-scale wars, harass everywhere, destroy all transportation lines and transportation, and destroy the entire social and economic organization. First, we must create poverty for all the people, and then use their dissatisfaction with the status quo to instigate them, lure them, and make them use us. Only in this way can we develop, survive, and be happy.

Commentary

### On the Political System in the Constitutional Draft

— Chen Ruxuan

Regarding the National Assembly in the Constitutional Draft, I have already written an article with my opinions. Now, I will further express my views on the central and local political systems stipulated in the Constitutional Draft:

(1) The Executive Yuan is responsible to the Legislative Yuan: The Constitutional Draft of May 5th stipulates that the President appoints and dismisses the President and Ministers of the Executive Yuan. Each is responsible to the President; and the President is elected and dismissed by the National Assembly, and is responsible to the National Assembly. However, the National Assembly only meets once every three years; the time is too long, and the supervision of the administration is inevitably lax. It is feared that the President's control over personnel and administrative power will turn into autocracy. Therefore, the amendment places administrative responsibility on the President of the Executive Yuan. The appointment of the President of the Executive Yuan is nominated by the President and approved by the Legislative Yuan. The Executive Yuan shall be responsible to the Legislative Yuan, and the following provisions shall be made for the manner of its responsibility: 1. The Executive Yuan is responsible for submitting policy reports to the Legislative Yuan, and the Legislative Yuan members have the right to question the Executive Yuan and its ministries and committees. 2. If the Legislative Yuan does not agree with the important policies of the Executive Yuan, it may resolve to request the Executive Yuan to change them. The Executive Yuan may, with the approval of the President, request the Legislative Yuan to reconsider the resolution of the Legislative Yuan. If two-thirds of the Legislative Yuan members present maintain the original resolution during the reconsideration, the President of the Executive Yuan shall accept or resign. 3. If the Executive Yuan considers the laws passed by the Legislative Yuan to be difficult to implement, it may, with the approval of the President, request the Legislative Yuan to reconsider. If two-thirds of the Legislative Yuan members present maintain the original plan during the reconsideration, the President of the Executive Yuan shall execute it or resign. This provision is roughly the same in effect as Article 70 of the May 5th Constitutional Draft, which states that "the President may submit the resolutions passed by the Legislative Yuan to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration before promulgation? If the Legislative Yuan maintains the original plan by two-thirds of the members present, the President shall promulgate and implement it." However, the amendment does not say "the President shall implement it immediately," but says "the President of the Executive Yuan shall implement it (or accept it) or resign." The intention is to avoid a head-on conflict between the President and the Legislative Yuan on the one hand, and to ensure the implementation of the resolutions of the Legislative Yuan on the other. The method is also appropriate. However, Article 70 of the May 5th Constitutional Draft states that "the President shall promulgate the resolutions passed by the Legislative Yuan within thirty days." This is to prevent the abuses of the US President, who uses the method of non-promulgation (that is, what is called Pocketveto) to resist the Congress; therefore, the time for promulgating the resolutions is specially restricted. If it is not promulgated after the deadline, it is a violation of the Constitution, and the act of violating the Constitution can be impeached. The execution or acceptance of the resolutions of the Legislative Yuan has been fully guaranteed, and whether the administrative side is willing or not, or whether to resign or not, is no longer a matter of importance. This arrangement also seems to be acceptable. As for the "right of inquiry" of the Legislative Yuan to the Executive Yuan stipulated in the amendment, since the Legislative Yuan no longer has the right to vote on confidence to overthrow the cabinet; the so-called "inquiry" is only to ask the Executive Yuan to explain and state its meaning; it is not comparable to the "right of questioning" (Interpellation) possessed by the parliamentary system congress. The "right of questioning" can overthrow the cabinet, and the effect of "inquiry" is at most equal to Questioning. Therefore, the powers of the President to submit reconsideration, the Legislative Yuan's right to approve the President's appointment of the President of the Executive Yuan, the Executive Yuan's report to the Legislative Yuan, and the Legislative Yuan's inquiry to the Executive Yuan, which are listed in the amendment, are mostly the practices of presidential countries. To fulfill their functions, they can only improve the relationship between the legislative and executive branches. It is impossible to create a responsible government in the cabinet system. Therefore, it is my opinion that Article 58 of the amendment, "The Executive Yuan shall be responsible to the Legislative Yuan in accordance with the following provisions," can in fact be deleted; and the following three items of that article can be combined into one item, which seems more logical.

(2) The division of power between the central and local governments: The Constitutional Draft of May 5th takes the county as the unit of local self-government. The county magistrate is elected by the people, and the people directly exercise the four powers (namely, election, recall, initiative, and referendum), while the province is nothing more than an administrative region of the central government. The provincial government is an agency for implementing central government laws and supervising local self-government. The governor is appointed and dismissed by the central government. The organization and powers of the provincial government and the provincial council shall be determined by law. As for the division of power between the central and local governments, it does not adopt the item-by-item enumeration method, but only makes a unilateral regulation in principle: "All matters that are suitable for local conditions shall be classified as local self-government matters"; and "local self-government matters shall be determined by law." In other words, the power of local self-government is not listed in the Constitution; but is received from the laws and regulations of the central government, which is a purely unitary system. Most countries in England and France are like this. The draft amendment is completely the opposite; it divides local self-government into two levels: province and county. The governor and county magistrate are elected by the people; both have elected councils. The most noteworthy point is the strict division of power between the central and provincial governments. Some are legislated by the central government and executed by the central government: such as foreign affairs, national defense, monetary system, etc., a total of thirteen items; some are legislated by the central government and can be executed by the provinces: such as agriculture, forestry, industry, mining, commerce, education system, etc., a total of seventeen items; some are legislated and executed by the provinces or executed by the counties, such as provincial and municipal finance, police, transportation, etc., a total of ten items, all listed in detail. As for the self-government laws of each province, they are not promulgated by the central government; but are formulated by the provincial people's congresses convened by each province. Within the scope of not conflicting with the national constitution, the central government shall not interfere. Moreover, because the powers of the province and the central government are listed in the national constitution, the provincial power and the central power are parallel; within the scope of their delineated powers, the central government and the province cannot infringe upon each other. If the provincial power needs to be adjusted, there is no other way except to amend the national constitution. It cannot be handled or changed by the laws of the Legislative Yuan. This method of decentralization is only found in federal countries. The power of the state and the power of the central government are listed in the national constitution; it is the iron rule of decentralization in the federal system. The difference between the federal and unitary systems lies not in the size of the self-government power, but in the source of the self-government power. In a unitary country, the power of the locality is received from the central government; and the power of the central government is received from the constitution. In a federal country, the power of the central government is received from the constitution, and the power of the locality is also received from the constitution. The self-government power received from the central government can be changed by the central government by law; the self-government power received from the constitution has the same status as the central power, and cannot be changed by the central government. For example, the US Federal Constitution lists the powers of the central government, and all powers not listed are attributed to the states; the scope is wider. Another example is the Canadian Provincial Constitution, which lists the powers of each province, and all powers not listed are attributed to the central government, so the scope of provincial self-government is narrower. Although these two methods of decentralization are different; because the self-government powers of the federal states are received from the constitution, they are all standard federal systems. Most federal countries such as Switzerland, Germany, and Austria are similar. Therefore, the chapter on "The Powers of the Central and Local Governments" in the amendment adopts the federal decentralization system. (Moreover, the method of listing the powers of the central and local governments in that chapter is exactly the same as Chapter 5 of the Constitution promulgated during the Cao Kun era in 1923, and that constitution also adopted federalism). Moreover, the chapter on "Provincial and County System" in the amendment stipulates that the provincial self-government law shall be formulated by the provincial people's congresses convened by each province. In addition to having an elected governor and council, all organizations can be freely created, as long as they "do not conflict with the Constitution." Therefore, as long as it does not conflict with the Constitution, the "self-government law" and the organizational law of the provincial government of each province are not subject to interference by the central government. This special status is only available to the state constitution or provincial constitution of a federal country (such as the state constitution of each state in the United States and the provincial constitution of each province in Canada, which cannot be amended by the Congress); as for a unitary country, the local self-government laws and regulations are all passed and promulgated by the Congress. The scope of self-government can be expanded as much as possible, but the source of power is from the central government, and the central government always maintains its supervisory position over the locality; this is the major difference between the provincial self-government law and the provincial constitution. The so-called "provincial self-government law" in the amendment is completely created by the locality; the central government cannot interfere. Its independent nature is the same as the state constitution of a federal country; it is better to call it "provincial constitution" instead of "provincial self-government law" to be more accurate.

In short, the provincial system and provincial power stipulated in the amendment (that is, Chapters 10 and 11) fully express federalism. If this is implemented, China should become a federal state; therefore, Article 1 of the original plan should be changed to "The Republic of China is a Federal Republic"; and the "Provincial Self-Government Law" in Chapter 10 should also be changed to Provincial Constitution to be more clear and avoid ambiguity. I must solemnly state here that federalism is by no means separatism. Every federal country in the world has a strong central government that controls the major powers of the country's diplomacy, military administration, national defense, monetary system, and tariffs. These major powers, which are related to the whole country, are never allowed to be interfered with by the locality. From this point of view, it is not impossible to say that the federation is a unified and centralized system. In the past, some people in our country advocated "provincial self-government," advocating the independence of each province, using the theory of plural sovereignty and the equality of provinces and countries as a shield, and using the name of provincial self-government to carry out the reality of feudal separatism; these are all sinners of federalism. I hope readers will analyze them and do not mislabel them. The above discussion is because Lan Yin sees that Chapters 10 and 11 in the amendment are obviously an unstated federal system, so he does not hesitate to point it out repeatedly to show its difference from the Constitutional Draft of May 5th. As for which is better, the federal system or the unitary system, and which is more suitable for our country, I am too shallow and dare not make a judgment rashly. I hope those who know will think deeply and choose carefully.

Other less important criticisms and technical issues regarding the provisions are not yet fully covered due to the length of the article. In short, the constitution is a great law for the whole country to abide by for a hundred years. The wording should be concise, and the reasoning should be clear. There should be no ambiguity, so that people can hardly tell the difference. It should be as orderly as a chessboard and as bright as the sun, so that those who enforce the law can follow the main road, which is as flat as a whetstone and as straight as an arrow, so that the spirit of the great law can be permanently maintained. Although there are many advantages, there are still many shortcomings that are not clear. I would like to present one or two of them for the reference of the wise and to correct them.

It has been approved by the provincial government meeting and can be officially established in January next year.

[Our Newspaper Hangzhou, 2nd] Five or six factories in southern Zhejiang, which were founded during the Anti-Japanese War, have been decided to be sold by the provincial government through open bidding. The valuation is currently being discussed and can be determined within a week.

### Zhejiang Province Organizes Mobile Troops to Patrol and Eliminate Bandits and Patients at Any Time; Hangzhou City Divides Winter Defense into Eleven Alert Zones

[Our Newspaper Hangzhou] The Zhejiang Provincial Security Command, in view of the rampant bandits in various places and the unrest among the people, is organizing mobile troops to prevent the spread of banditry, in order to dispatch them at any time, or patrol in the bandit areas, and assist the local troops in suppressing them.

[Our Newspaper Hangzhou] The 7th Regiment of the Military Police in this city has transferred 500 new recruits to strengthen the winter defense work. As for the winter defense work, a detailed plan is now being drafted to divide the city into eleven alert zones.

### Review Achievements After the End of Conscription

Order to Various Counties from Southern Jiangsu Garrison District

[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang] The Southern Jiangsu Garrison District Command, in order to understand the conscription achievements of various counties, districts, townships, and baojia, stipulates that after the end of this conscription, each county should immediately review the conscription situation of each district, township, and baojia in the county, and report the merits and demerits and whether they can be handled in accordance with the law for rewards and punishments.

### Traitor Zhang Fengsheng Sentenced to Two Years; Prosecutor Files an Appeal

[Our Newspaper Suzhou, 2nd] Zhang Fengsheng, a native of Zhejiang, who once served as a counselor in the puppet army Li Changjiang's department, chairman of the puppet Taidian County Cooperative, and chairman of the puppet flour and wheat control committee, etc., was sentenced to two years of imprisonment by the criminal court of the Suzhou High Court. The prosecutor in charge of the case, Jiang Yaozu, believes that the traitor relied on the enemy's power to oppress workers, control materials, and manipulate flour and wheat during his tenure in various puppet positions, and even donated copper coins stored in the factory to the enemy. The traces of treason are very obvious. Not only is the investigation clear, but also the witnesses Jia Ayin and Wang Genbao have testified repeatedly. The crimes of affecting the Anti-Japanese War are very serious. The original sentence of the lowest punishment is inappropriate. Moreover, the fact that he served as a puppet counselor and donated copper coins were not discussed, which is even more inappropriate. Therefore, he filed an appeal in accordance with the law on the 2nd, requesting the Supreme Court to review the sentence.

Unexpectedly, Qian Guonian, the current town chief of the town, ignored the law and falsely reported to the local police station that he was capturing bandits. For a time, the police station believed it to be true and fired warning shots, causing great chaos. Deputy Captain Yu opened the door to investigate and was searched all over. A copy of the wanted order for Lu Qiying issued by the Third District Commissioner's Office of Jiangsu was found on the spot and torn up by the town chief.

[Our Newspaper East China] The Xiangxiang troops of the East China Garrison have been stationed in East China for more than a year. Now, in order to coordinate the feelings between the military and the people, strengthen military-civilian cooperation, promote the military reputation, and increase combat power, the troops at all levels have launched the Love-the-People Association.

### Suzhou Cloth Factories Firmly Request Yarn Allocation; Unite Four Counties of Yu, Xi, Wu, and Cheng to Act Together

[Our Newspaper Suzhou, 2nd] The Raw Material Cotton Yarn of the Cloth Industry Association in this county is purchased on the black market, which is 40% more expensive than the allocation price in Shanghai. The production cost is too high, and it cannot be sold like Shanghai goods. Therefore, in the past two months, 10 factories have closed down. The existing 42 factories are also in danger. The public is anxious and cannot live a day. Representatives were sent to Shanghai to contact the textile company to seek treatment and request yarn allocation according to the precedent, but they returned without success. On the 2nd, an emergency meeting of all members was convened, and it was generally believed that if this continues, the cloth industry has no other way to go except for collective bankruptcy. The way to save it is to quickly obtain the right to allocate raw materials. After the decision, on the one hand, a petition was submitted to the relevant agencies such as the Suzhou Provisional Council, and on the other hand, the cloth industries in the four counties of Yu, Xi, Wu, and Cheng jointly submitted a petition to the ministries and institutes of the National Government, pouring out the current crisis and requesting approval to allocate cotton yarn equally in accordance with the Shanghai precedent.

### Chongming People Request Re-affiliation

[Our Newspaper Chongming] Before the war, this county was under the jurisdiction of the Fourth District Commissioner's Office, but there is no direct ferry between Chongming and Nantong, and all traffic must pass through Shanghai, which is very inconvenient. Not only is it time-consuming and costly, but also the implementation of government orders is often separated. Moreover, the customs, customs, language, and habits of Chongming are very similar to those of Jiangnan, which is very different from Nantong. Economically, it can be regarded as a link in Shanghai, and has nothing to do with Nantong. The gentry Lu Jiajun and others made a special trip to the province to request that Chongming be re-affiliated to the Third District Commissioner's Office. The people of the county also submitted petitions, asking to accept public opinion and quickly re-affiliate to facilitate rehabilitation and construction. The provincial government is now considering this issue.

### Tax Valuation Too High; Suixi Merchants Strike

[Our Newspaper Suxian] The Suxian Tax Collection Office recently sent an investigator Hu to Suixi Town to investigate the capital of various businesses as a tax standard.

Even renting a house or borrowing a house was included in the capital, and the estimated value was increased by hundreds or thousands of times. Without any accommodation, it caused dissatisfaction among the merchants and all the merchants went on strike and appealed to all sectors.

### In the Rural Areas of Eastern Sea – Observations from the Comforting and Recovering Areas

— By Our Correspondent, Li Shangnong

Since the National Army recovered several important strongholds in Northern Jiangsu, such as Suqian, Siyang, and Huaiyin, the Communist troops entrenched in the southwestern rural areas of the East China Sea county were shaken and panicked, showing signs of collapse. Consequently, the returning home defense corps of the East China Sea County, led by Regiment Commander Ni Aitang, began a homecoming counterattack against the Communist troops within the county. They successively recovered Pingming, Chendun, Zhuowang, Ponan, Shangfang, Jidang, Xinggou, Baisha, Xiafang, Nanliu, and other villages.

To comfort the recovered area residents, understand the general situation, promote party and government work, and implement relief efforts, the East China Sea County Magistrate Zhou Tian, the County Party Secretary, the Chief Secretary of the Youth League East China Sea Branch Dong Lifu, and the former head of the homecoming defense corps, Ni Aitang, gathered at the East China Sea County Government at 9:00 AM on November 21st and departed for the recovered area. This reporter also participated in the trip.

We traveled over twenty li of dry land by rickshaw out of the city to the bank of the Qiangwei River. A sailboat was prepared in advance, and the wind was favorable, allowing the boat to move like a horse. Boards were laid on the deck, and as we looked around, the harvested autumn crops had already died due to the Communist troops diverting the canal water, leaving only the dry yellow branches on the top swaying in the wind. The water in the fields had not completely receded. In some places, the water in the fields was connected to the river, making them indistinguishable. In the distance, sparse villages were scattered amidst the water.

As the boat moved alongside the reeds, countless water birds were startled by the sound of the oars and flew into the sky. Along the riverbanks, fishermen had set up many fish traps and crab weirs. In the grass, there were still lingering autumn insects chirping, like the final gasps of dying refugees!

At 3:00 PM, we arrived at Xinba. The party and government leaders immediately summoned the district chiefs and all the residents to give speeches, conveying the government's utmost concern for the compatriots in the recovered area. The next morning, we set off again by boat from Xinba. The weather was clear, and the autumn scenery was pleasant. We passed through Zhuowang Lake, where the residents, having been informed in advance, gathered on the riverbank to welcome us, supporting the old and leading the young. The inspection team immediately ordered the boat to dock and disembarked one by one to exchange greetings with the local residents. County Magistrate Zhou also delivered a message of comfort.

The welcoming residents spontaneously offered baskets of eggs and teapots of tea to the comforting team. The leaders politely declined and set off again. At 4:00 PM, we arrived at Shangfang. The village had been occupied by the Communist troops four times, each time driven out by our forces. The houses and bunkers in the village were destroyed by artillery fire and demolished by the Communist troops, leaving rubble everywhere and a desolate scene.

That evening, the comforting team traveled to the Yishui Wang Village for the night. At dawn on the third day, we again boarded the boat and arrived at Pingming Township. After disembarking and gathering the residents to comfort them, we inspected the nearby villages. The local residents, having been ravaged by the Communist troops, were in dire straits, with most homes empty, barely clothed, and underfed. The people's faces showed signs of suffering. Seeing the government officials arrive to offer comfort, they tearfully grabbed their clothes and recounted the various atrocities of the Communist troops, expressing their hatred and resentment with tears in their eyes. The people who had not yet returned home and were still wandering outside unanimously begged the county magistrate to issue them firearms, vowing to fight the Communist troops to the death, return to their hometowns, and rebuild their fields.

In the afternoon, we planned to continue to Chewang and other villages, but the land was flooded, making it difficult to move around. Therefore, we turned the boat around and returned.

### India's Political Center Moves to London; Anglo-Indian Conference Begins Today; Aiming to Eliminate Friction Between India's Two Major Political Parties

[Our Dispatch] Paris, 2nd (Radio from London): Governor-General Wavell of India and leaders of various Indian political parties, having taken a special plane from India via Basra, Cairo, and Malta to England, are expected to arrive here today.

Another dispatch states that the plane carrying the Governor-General and others was forced to land in Malta due to minor mechanical issues.

[Our Dispatch] London, 2nd (Radio): The British Cabinet convened this morning to discuss the detailed agenda for the Anglo-Indian talks. The Anglo-Indian talks will begin here tomorrow, with both sides exchanging views.

[Reuters, Cairo, 1st] Governor-General Wavell of India, along with Indian leaders, arrived here today by special plane and stayed overnight before continuing to London tomorrow. Nehru said upon disembarking that there were no disputes between Hindus and Muslims in India, and that the problems were mostly related to political views. When asked whether the London conference could eliminate the friction between the Congress Party and the Muslim League, Nehru replied that one could not be pessimistic or optimistic in politics, but could only do one's best. Jinnah, the leader of the Muslim League, said that before going to London, Prime Minister Attlee had assured him that he would re-examine the entire Indian situation, and that he would continue to fight for the ninety million Muslims in India and would never accept a constitution that would subjugate Muslims.

[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 1st Dispatch] The Indian police and the group of Nehru, Jinnah, Qari Khan, and Singh flew to London this morning. After their departure, India's political center temporarily shifted to the British capital. The main talks between Indian leaders and British ministers will begin on the 3rd. According to dispatches from London, Indian leaders will be treated as plenipotentiaries, and the meeting will be held at 10 Downing Street. British Prime Minister Attlee finally persuaded the Indian party leaders to visit London with perseverance. The Congress Party leaders initially rejected the invitation but later accepted it. Jinnah, the chairman of the Muslim League, initially accepted but then hesitated before finally agreeing to participate in the London talks. After Jinnah accepted the invitation, he heard that Attlee had given Nehru certain guarantees and therefore put forward a condition for his visit to London. Jinnah telegraphed Attlee, saying that unless they could discuss the entire situation, there would be no point in him going to London. Attlee replied that Jinnah's refusal to travel was due to a misunderstanding of his telegram to Nehru, which did not detract from the full consideration of all views. Defense Minister Singh, the representative of the Sikh community, said before leaving India that the Sikh community would resist any attempt to partition India. Home Minister Patel, who rejected the British invitation, gave a speech yesterday, saying that the biggest problem facing India was how to reject social problems. The Muslim League was inclined towards a divided India, even at the cost of bloodshed, while other parties opposed partition under any circumstances and would not be contaminated by the Muslim League's strategy. Patel's rejection of the invitation reflected the Congress Party's disapproval of the London conference. Informed sources doubt whether Nehru will act on behalf of the Congress Party without consulting Patel and Congress Party Chairman Kriplani, but if the British and Indian leaders can jointly promote an agreement on the procedures for convening a constitutional conference before the parliamentary session, and enable the Muslim League to participate in the conference, it will make a great contribution to India's constitutional drafting.

### British Strategy in the Near East; Attempts to Consolidate Power; Soviet Union Believes Spears' Plan is Bound to Fail

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 1st] Regarding the visit of former British Minister to Syria and Lebanon Spears to the Near East, the Soviet journal "New Times" commented with an article titled "General Spears' Visit is Bound to Fail," stating that Spears' visit to the Near East aimed to organize a military alliance with Arab countries to ensure British dominance in the Near East. Spears has a considerable reputation in the Near East, and everyone knows that he is a British imperialist agent in Arab countries. He has repeatedly given speeches, always emphasizing the friendship between Britain and Arab countries and their common interests, but the Arab people and newspapers have unanimously opposed his proposed plan. The article stated that Spears' plan attempted to gain the cooperation of Arab countries, but the presence of British troops in Arab countries was the real danger, so Arab countries should make British troops withdraw as soon as possible. This shows that the British government's situation is very difficult. The British Foreign Office representative declared on the 15th of last month that General Spears' trip to the Near East was purely a private trip and that he had not been given any official mission. In short, Spears' trip is bound to fail, but we must note that this is not the first, nor the last, attempt.

### Universal Disarmament Proposal Temporarily Shelved; Veto Power Re-Discussed; United Nations General Assembly Political Committee Meets for Three Hours; Countries Still Fail to Reach Agreement

[United Press, Lake Success, 1st] At today's meeting of the Political and Security Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, US Representative Connally called on the five permanent members of the United Nations to limit the use of the veto power, stating, "No" country can independently embark on the path to peace, but must move forward together. No country can independently dominate the world, history has shattered this dream. " The committee discussed the issue of limiting the use of the veto power for three hours, but no agreement was reached. Finally, a vote of thirty-three to eight passed to transfer the case to a small committee to try to draft a resolution. This is the third time that countries have failed to reach an agreement on the issue of veto power.

### British Restriction Plan Contains Seven Key Points

[United Press, Lake Success, 1st] Britain today proposed a plan in the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly to restrict the exercise of the veto power, but advocated that the five permanent members of the Security Council should still retain this privilege to prevent future problems related to the safety of each country from being overwhelmed by the majority vote of other countries, resulting in an irreparable situation. The Soviet Union immediately put forward a counter-proposal, opposing changing the veto power in any way. The committee was so busy discussing this issue that it had to temporarily shelve the issue of universal disarmament in the world.

The British proposal includes the following seven recommendations: (1) The five permanent members with veto power may consult with each other before voting in order to reach consensus. (2) If the five permanent members cannot reach consensus, the minority of them should consider that they are acting in the interests of the entire United Nations, so they must exercise the veto power only when it has a significant impact on the overall interests of the United Nations. (3) The five permanent members should not exercise the veto power simply because a certain proposal does not fully meet their wishes. (4) The five permanent members may propose rules of procedure in the Security Council, but this must be proposed only after all methods have been tried and failed, and must be proposed using proper methods. (5) The five permanent members may propose to add rules of procedure to the Security Council, such as forming a conciliation committee before the final discussion and vote. (6) In order to define the definition of "dispute," first agree on several methods to facilitate the proceedings. (7) Abstaining from voting by a permanent member shall not be considered an exercise of the veto power. Not attending the meeting and therefore not participating in the vote by a permanent member shall also not be considered an exercise of the veto power.

After British representative Shawcross made the above suggestions, he also asked the Soviet Union to make some concessions and jointly agree on a practical solution for the public interest. Shawcross also said, "We must have a new concept and a new solution for major interests. The abuse of the veto power is not the disease itself, but only a symptom. The disease is the lack of trust, suspicion, and hostility, which casts a dark shadow on the relationship between great powers." Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky then proposed that the General Assembly pass a resolution stating, "This meeting now trusts that the Security Council will be able to fully consider its past experience in the future and achieve a situation where various resolutions can be agreed upon."

### Montgomery Arrives in Athens on Tour; Will Convene Meeting of British Generals; Greek Prime Minister Explains Mission to the United States

### Liverpool to Install World's Largest Radar

British Channel in Full View

[Associated Press, Liverpool, 1st] The Port of Liverpool will install the world's largest radar equipment, with a screen larger than ten feet square, making it the most modern radar equipment area in the British Isles. The Mersey Docks and Harbour Board plans to use radar to observe the movements of various ships in the English Channel. This radar installation will cost 30,000 pounds, approximately US$120,000, and will be installed on a tower on Gladstone Dock. According to Hurd, the marine surveyor of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, the Port Authority hopes to speed up the handling of various ships and save time and money for shipping companies. In case of fog, the position of each ship and its nearby obstacles can be accurately reported to the pilots. By using radar equipment on the shore, we can instruct the pilots the ship's location and its relationship to other ships, and use the reflector to find buoys blown away by the wind. In addition, radar can be used to enable salvage ships to rescue ships in distress in any weather. Recently, a salvage ship used radar to discover a floating mine in a thick fog where objects could not be seen beyond 100 yards and destroyed it. This mine had drifted 14 miles out of the harbor channel.

### The Horrifying Berlin Sex Fiend Raped and Murdered 45 Women One After Another

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 1st] Allied police authorities have recently discovered an unprecedentedly sadistic demon in German criminal files. This demon, named Rock, murdered 45 women and four married couples in Berlin between February 1914 and March 1943. Rock started killing as early as the age of sixteen. His mother was a laundry woman in a hospital who lived in the town of Köpenick on the outskirts of Berlin. Every day, she sent her son to return the cleaned clothes to customers. Whenever Rock encountered single women, he attacked them with any weapon at hand, including axes, knives, hammers, sticks, and ropes. When encountering the person who was about to suffer, this monster raped them completely, sometimes dismembering the corpse and leaving it in a pool of blood. Rock also attacked single women he met in parks or forests, killing them and burying their bodies. On one occasion, a woman was walking in a park with her young child when she met this sex fiend. The mother was killed and the child was abandoned. Rock was arrested on March 10, 1943, and secretly taken to Vienna, because Berlin was then being bombed by Allied aircraft. German doctors performed various experiments on the prisoner, such as castration. From the photos, the prisoner had an ape-like face, hideous and terrifying, which could indeed frighten women. The human demon died in Vienna on April 8, 1944.

### Disturbances Have Subsided, Order Restored; Municipal Party Headquarters Convenes Meeting of Various Groups; Six Aftermath Measures Approved; Investigate and Release the Innocent, Publicly Try the Rioters

[Reported by This Newspaper] The disturbance in this city caused by the vendor problem has returned to normal yesterday after Mayor Wu's broadcast the night before, sincerely explaining the situation. Starting in the morning, the shops reopened one after another, only the shops near the Huangpu and Laozha police stations, fearing accidents, opened later. The notice of emergency measures implemented by the Songhu Garrison Command was posted all over the streets after 8:00, which made people feel more at ease. However, the Nanshi Shiliupu and Fuyou Road vegetable markets were once attempted to be disrupted by unscrupulous elements, but were eventually dispersed by the police in time.

Director Fang of the Municipal Party Headquarters specially invited representatives of various people's organizations in the city to hold a meeting at 2:00 p.m. yesterday in the conference room of the Party Headquarters to discuss the aftermath measures for the disturbance caused by the vendor problem. Xiang Changquan of the Municipal Council, Feng Youzhen of the Journalists Association, Jiang Zhaowu of the Chamber of Commerce, Shui Xiangyun of the Trade Union, Zhou Feicheng of the Education Association, and representatives of the Youth League Branch, Local Association, Women's Association, Student Federation and other groups, as well as more than 30 news reporters attended. Director Fang first reported that the disturbance caused by the vendor problem has been suppressed by the military and police authorities with all their strength, and social order in the city has now returned to normal. However, Shanghai is the most important metropolis in the country, and public security must be reliably guaranteed. It is regrettable that this unfortunate incident occurred during the National Assembly in Beijing. Now that the situation has subsided, it is urgent to discuss appropriate measures for the aftermath. It is hoped that representatives of various groups will express their opinions as much as possible and discuss together. After the speech, Xiang Changquan, Secretary-General of the Municipal Council, reported on the Council's handling of the vendors' petition, and Xie Renzhao, Secretary-General of the Municipal Party Headquarters, reported on the resolutions of the Municipal Party Headquarters' temporary executive meeting on handling the incident. After the report, representatives of various groups expressed their opinions one after another, as follows:

### Journalists Association Protests

Feng Youzhen, the representative of the Journalists Association, said that after this unfortunate incident occurred, several newspaper reporters were beaten by police officers while performing their duties. On behalf of the Journalists Association, I hereby protest to the police station. This incident was quickly suppressed by the Municipal Government and the military and police authorities, which is commendable. However, some unresolved issues that have arisen as a result must be resolved urgently. For example: (1) The vendor problem, it is hoped that the Municipal Government will find a reasonable solution as soon as possible; (2) It is hoped that the military and police authorities will take effective measures to maintain public security. For the rioters who took advantage of the vendor petition opportunity to disrupt public security and were arrested by the police station, it is hoped that the government will conduct a public trial; (3) For some innocent shops that were destroyed by the rioters, especially the Gaoshengda Paper Store, which suffered the most damage, people from all walks of life should show human sympathy and donate condolence money to help them.

### Responsibility Must Be Investigated

Wang Zhaohu, the representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, said that many of the shops damaged by the rioters were members of the Chamber of Commerce. Today, one or two shops have appealed to the Chamber of Commerce for compensation for losses. The government should allocate relief funds to compensate them for their losses. As for whether the shops will accept the donations from all walks of life, it is not known, but it is out of the development of human sympathy, and the damaged shops can also obtain spiritual comfort. However, the aftermath of this incident must be dealt with in both the root and the branch. Compensation and assistance are only temporary solutions. The responsibility for causing this unfortunate incident must also be investigated. The Huangpu Branch Bureau's improper handling of the matter at the beginning cannot be completely excused. The business community is operating as usual today, showing its support for the government's maintenance of social order with its actions. However, it is also sincerely hoped that similar incidents will not happen again in the future.

### Wang Xianqing Describes Being Beaten

Wang Hao of the Frontline Daily News put forward two points: (1) The military and police responsible for law enforcement should strictly abide by the law; (2) Request the government to provide effective protection for journalists to interview and publish news. After Wang's speech, Councilor Wang Xianqing arrived at the meeting. Director Fang immediately asked Wang to report on the process of being beaten after going to the Huangpu Branch Bureau on the 30th of last month on behalf of the Municipal Council to investigate the truth of the matter. Wang made a detailed report, proving that the police officers' actions at the time were indeed improper, and believed that the branch bureau should be responsible for the expansion of the situation. Later, Secretary Xie reported that the expansion of the situation was indeed due to someone taking the opportunity to incite the masses and disrupt public security, attempting to create a tragedy and a situation of terror. For example, the slogans shouted by the masses at the time included "The Kuomintang is creating the second May Thirtieth Massacre," which fully proves that it was not done by vendors or their families, but an organized and planned illegal act of violence with political motives. After Xie's report, Sun Dongcheng of Xinye Daily, Shui Xiangyun of the General Trade Union, Zhou Lianze of the Municipal Party Headquarters, and Zhou Feicheng of the Education Association expressed their opinions one after another. They all agreed that police discipline must be improved to prevent arbitrary beatings of the people. At the same time, the government's various policies should be carefully considered in advance for the impact they may cause, and implemented solemnly to avoid problems.

### Director Fang Speaks His Views

After the representatives finished their speeches, Director Fang expressed his views, the main points being: (1) In banning vendors, the government did not do its best in publicity work in advance, and the Party Headquarters and party members did not do their best to assist in the publicity; (2) Arresting vendors and detaining them for many days, their families petitioning for their release was an inevitable result. The authorities should have planned in advance and sought appropriate solutions to avoid being used for rumors and incitement; (3) When the Huangpu Branch Bureau released the vendors, it should have released them in public when the masses were surrounding them, and announced it publicly to the masses. Then the vendors' families would have dispersed, and the ambitious rioters would have had no opportunity to take advantage of it; (4) When the masses surrounded and clamored, the police only fired blank shots to suppress them, which was indeed the greatest patience and is commendable. As for the expansion of the situation, it is obvious that the rioters took the opportunity to create a bloody tragedy and a situation of terror, in order to achieve their conspiracy to undermine public security and disrupt social order. Now that the incident has been resolved quickly and no bloody tragedy has occurred, it proves that the government and the military and police authorities are capable of maintaining public security, and the rioters' plan has completely failed. However, the public security problem in this city in the future still deserves the close attention, vigilance, and preparedness of all citizens and the municipal government and military and police agencies.

### Drafted into Motions

Director Fang then summarized the opinions of the representatives and drafted six resolutions: (1) The government should immediately select appropriate, open places that do not hinder traffic and temporarily allow vendors to operate to maintain their livelihoods. Vendors should also pay attention to tidiness during business hours to maintain the appearance of the city. (2) The innocent victims among those detained this time should be released after investigation as soon as possible. The rioters who used the name of vendors to disrupt public security should be publicly tried separately as soon as possible. Those with solid evidence should be severely punished according to law to show the government's determination to eliminate violence and maintain public order. (3) The police station should return the vendors' belongings that it has collected as soon as possible. (4) The Party Headquarters, the government, and various groups in the city should extend the greatest sympathy to the shops destroyed by the rioters, especially the Gaoshengda Paper Store, which has meager capital, and donate condolence money. Innocent citizens who were injured by the rioters should also be comforted and relieved separately. (The condolence money will be collected by the Shanghai Central Daily.) (5) The Huangpu Branch Bureau should thoroughly investigate the incident. (6) As it is winter, the government and military and police agencies should pay close attention to winter defense to maintain public security. All were unanimously passed. The resolutions were sent to the Municipal Government for reference last night by the Municipal Party Headquarters.

### More Than 30 Suspects Arrested

[Reported by This Newspaper] In addition to those who were arrested as suspected rioters in the past two days who have been released after investigation and found to be irrelevant, there are also Yu Fusheng (21 years old, Shaodian native), Sun Jingyang (16 years old, Fenghua native), Zhang Zhengshan (28 years old, Yangzhou native), Jiang Baohong (19 years old, Wuxi native), Shen Hanying (27 years old, Suzhou native), Ma Muyi (31 years old, Yangzhou native), Shi Dalang (37 years old, Chongming native), Wu Decai (23 years old, Jiangbei native), Wang Delin (24 years old, Jiangbei native), Dong Caizheng (45 years old, Ningbo native), Zhang Mingqi (23 years old, Jiangbei native), Wang Guoyou (25 years old, Zhejiang native), Gu Hongren (28 years old, Jiangbei native), Zheng Rong (34 years old, Guangdong native), Ding Futang (27 years old, Suzhou native), Zhou Jinhai (20 years old, Shaoxing native) and 16 others, and a total of about 20 people arrested by the Laozha Branch Bureau were transferred to the Criminal Division of the General Bureau for investigation yesterday.

### Small Disturbances in Nanshi

[Reported by This Newspaper] After the police station's notice yesterday morning, the shops in Shanghai resumed business as usual. However, there were still some unscrupulous people who gathered at Jiucang Street and Dajing Road in the city at about 10:00 yesterday morning, attempting to cause trouble again. They shouted along the way, ordering the shops to close. They then went to the Jiumudi vegetable market to intimidate the vegetable vendors to stop selling vegetables. The situation was quite chaotic at the time. The vegetable vendors fled, and many shops closed automatically, resulting in some broken glass windows. After receiving the report, the local Yiyi Branch Bureau Xiangxue Road Police Station sent police to suppress them and arrested suspects Jia Songlin, Han Changlin, Zhang Gouzi, Chen Benshan and others. One of them was holding a wooden stick. At the same time, six food stalls were overturned by a small group of people near Shiliupu Dama Road, and Zhang Zigen, Chen Konglang, Shan Jinmao, and Zhou Xianju were arrested on the spot. It was also learned that the Tangjiawan vegetable market was once disturbed at 10:00 yesterday morning. After the police rushed to the scene, the rioters dispersed and fled. Also, a congee stall in front of the Brothers Store in Laoximen was destroyed.

### Director Fang of the Municipal Party Headquarters Visits Two Places Yesterday to Express Condolences

Fang, the director of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, visited Director Du of the Huangpu Branch Bureau yesterday morning to inquire about the incident. At that time, the bureau was sorting out the vendors' goods and preparing to return them. Fang and Secretary Xie and Director Chen went to the affected businesses at 10:30 a.m. and first went to Gaoshengda Paper Store on Jinling East Road. The owner, Gao Chengxi, was not there at the time, and the manager, Lu Xuecheng, received them. Fang and others then went to the Daxin Company to express their condolences.

### Police Attitude Should Be Improved; Spirit of Patience is Commendable; Mayor Wu Expresses His Thoughts Yesterday; Hopes that Industry and Commerce Circles Will Work Together to Prevent Disturbances

[Reported by This Newspaper] Regarding the disturbance, Mayor Wu expressed his thoughts yesterday, believing that the police's attitude towards citizens must be improved, and expressed his commendation for the military and police's spirit of patience in this incident. The main points are: (1) Regarding the problem of banning vendors, the authorities are extremely cautious. The disturbance caused by this incident was purely an attempt by conspiratorial rioters to create a tragedy. Those responsible for public security have put in painstaking efforts to handle it. The conspirators' actions on Saturday night in the downtown area of ​​the central district, such as destroying shops and disrupting traffic, were completely aimed at expanding the situation, forcing strikes and market closures, in order to achieve their goal of inciting and creating a policy of terror. I ordered the military and police at the time to absolutely not allow them to open fire, so in the absence of any other options, only blank wooden shells were fired. I express my commendation for the military and police's spirit of patience. (2) The purpose of the Municipal Government's banning of vendors in the Huangpu and Laozha districts is to maintain traffic in the downtown area. This measure is not wrong, and the vendors were given a period of five months to relocate their businesses and find other livelihoods, fully demonstrating that the government has taken into account the vendors' livelihoods. The rumors that the detained vendors died of starvation and freezing are not true. However, some junior staff members in the police station who served during the Concession period and were retained after screening may inevitably spread old habits. The attitude towards citizens will be improved in the future. I will put forward a warning at the municipal meeting that all government officials and staff in all bureaus should maintain the spirit that civil servants are public servants of the citizens and should serve the citizens. Finally, it was said that the disturbance had come to an end by the afternoon before yesterday. Yesterday morning, the police stations sent police to persuade the shops to resume business as usual. At around 9:00, the city's order was completely restored to normal. However, the conspirators who caused the trouble still exist. Whether in the industrial, commercial, or academic circles, they all need to have a clear understanding and work together with the government to prevent disturbances in order to achieve the goal of stabilizing social order.

### Continued Notes on Those Wounded by Gunfire in Previous Days' Disturbances

[Reported by This Newspaper] Among those injured by stray bullets in the vendor incident in the previous days, there are three more: (1) Jia Shoukai, 24 years old, a leatherworker, living at 28 Dangchun Lane, Jiumudi. He was shot in the right arm by a stray bullet at the Zhengjiamu Bridge and Jinling Road intersection at 11 a.m. before and went to the Municipal Second Hospital at the Santai Pier in Nanshi. The hospital did not report it to the Huangpu Branch Bureau until yesterday morning. (2) Tong Hailin Haicheng, 14 years old, from Chaozhou, living at 127 Baoxing Lane, Zhejiang South Road, was gazing idly on Molin Street at about 12 p.m. when he was shot in the right thigh by a stray bullet. (3) Du Zhoumin, from Hebei, 22 years old, living at 90 Nanyang Bridge, was wandering on Jinling Road at 1 p.m. the day before yesterday when he was also shot in the crotch. He was later sent to the Isolation Hospital for treatment.

### Small Survey of the Great Storm: Estimated Losses Exceed 500 Million; 197 Pieces of Glass of Various Sizes Destroyed

[Our Dispatch] The other day, rioters took advantage of the vendor incident to create disturbances and destroy shops. Yesterday, our reporter visited 27 affected shops (including department stores, theaters, hotels, inns, dance halls, pharmacies, and fruit stores) to investigate the extent of the damage. A total of 197 pieces of glass of various sizes were destroyed, totaling 230 million yuan. Adding in the scattered losses of goods, the 200 million yuan worth of inventory burned at Gao Sheng, and the uninvestigated damaged shops, the direct losses caused by this unfortunate incident are over 500 million legal tender. As for various indirect losses, including the business losses suffered by shops throughout the city, that number is too large to estimate.

A large fresh fruit store on Henan South Road, which had just opened on December 1st and had barely made a few easy sales, was suddenly flooded with customers who didn't pay, grabbing oranges, apples, and pears and stuffing them into bags. Suddenly, a shout of "Fight!" erupted, the pot for roasting chestnuts was smashed, the scale was flattened, and the neon lights, mirror frames, and eight glass windows were all broken. The shop assistants rushed to put up the wooden door panels, but despite their quick efforts, one of the panels went missing. At this time, the Lao Wanxin restaurant, which hadn't closed yet diagonally across the street, also became a target of the rioters. The pot for frying dumplings was thrown into the middle of the road, and white chicken, roast duck, and marinated goods were all discarded. The losses for both businesses are estimated to be around 2 million yuan.

The Bo'ai Pharmacy on Huanghe Road also had its grand opening on the first. Around 3 PM, while many ladies were purchasing cosmetics and tonics, hundreds of rioters suddenly swarmed in, smashing four glass windows, eight neon lights, and many liquid medicines in the display cases. Many of the flower baskets displayed at the entrance became weapons for the rioters, and the total loss amounted to 20 million yuan.

Other shops were mostly destroyed by various types of glass: showcase glass, door glass, signboard glass, and small window glass. These glasses included British, German, and American products. The largest glass cost more than 8 million yuan per piece, and the smallest cost more than 10,000 yuan.

### A List of Losses: Detailed Account

Now, our reporter will record the details of these losses below: —

Yong'an Company provided the most precise estimate of the damage. Six pieces of glass of various sizes were broken at Yong'an New Building, with a total value of 27.28 million yuan.

### Inciters of the Disturbance: Bad Elements to be Dealt with According to Martial Law; Director Xuan Talks About Aftermath Issues

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday morning around 9 AM, Police Chief Xuan Tiewu patrolled in plain clothes to inspect the city's security situation and listened to reports from various police stations. Xuan first went to the Huangpu Precinct, the location of the incident, and then went to the Taishan, Xincheng, and Lao Zha Precincts, expressing satisfaction with the security measures in each district. Around 10 AM, our reporter met Director Guan at the Lao Zha Precinct, who replied to inquiries, saying: "The suspected criminals arrested during this disturbance are currently under strict investigation. All bad elements who incite the disturbance and engage in arson and chaos, once verified, will be dealt with according to martial law. If it is clearly verified that they were innocently implicated, they will be released on bail. As for those injured by gunfire in the incident who are indeed poor and helpless, they have been sent to public hospitals for treatment, and their medical expenses will be borne by the municipal government until they recover. However, those bad elements who took the opportunity to cause trouble and create chaos, even their deaths would not be regrettable." Director Xuan ended by stating that the city's security, with its strong military and police forces, can be absolutely relied upon. He sincerely hopes that citizens will live and work in peace, and not disturb each other.

### Three Points of View from Vendors; More Than Ten Representatives Go to the City Council to Present Their Case

[Our Dispatch] More than ten vendor representatives, including Bao Guizhi and Liu Huashan, went to the City Council yesterday morning and afternoon in separate groups to verbally present their opinions on the aftermath. Summarized below: (1) They will abide by the city government's regulations and find public or private open spaces in the Huangpu and Lao Zha districts to conduct business in a centralized manner. (2) Before suitable locations are found, they request the city government to consider the vendors' livelihoods and inform the police department to temporarily suspend enforcement. (3) They request the police department to return the confiscated stalls and goods. Secretary-General Xiang replied that the first and third points were considered reasonable and would be forwarded to the city government and police department for adoption. However, the point about postponing enforcement would need to be discussed with the city government before a response could be given. Furthermore, because the representatives only made verbal presentations temporarily, fearing that they might not represent the opinions of all vendors, they were instructed to consult with the vendors and then submit a written statement to the council for referral to the city government for handling.

### Glass Prices Soar

Most of the broken glass has not yet been replaced. Because glass prices are extremely high, they have been soaring in the past couple of days. Glass that cost more than 1 million yuan a piece before has risen to more than 4 million yuan yesterday. It is said that prices will rise further tomorrow, and even more the day after.

Most shop owners have reported to the police station, awaiting the authorities' disposition. However, the glass windows of Xinxin Company were insured, but the insurance company said that they are not responsible for compensating for damage caused by rioters. The two sides are still in negotiations.

This storm has passed, but how much more vigilant should we be in preventing it in the future!

### Foreigners Incur Few Losses

[Our Dispatch] In the major disturbances caused by the detention of street vendors the other day, except for a few foreign-owned cars having their windows smashed by stones and a US Information Service jeep being destroyed, there have been no serious losses for foreigners. Our reporter visited the consulates of the United Kingdom and the United States in Shanghai and was told by their spokesmen that no expatriates had come to complain of losses. As for the American military, they ordered soldiers not to leave their barracks on the day of the incident, so they were also safe.

### City Government and Police Department Send Representatives to Console Injured Reporters; Errant Police Officers to be Severely Punished

[Our Dispatch] Since this disturbance occurred, Mayor Wu and Director Xuan have deeply apologized and expressed regret for the shock and unease suffered by citizens and the disturbance to the local area. In addition to Mayor Wu summoning Gao Chengxi, the owner of Gao Sheng Jianzhi Stationery Store, for condolences yesterday morning, he also sent Ouyang Zunquan, the Chief of General Affairs of the City Government, as his representative at 6 PM, and Director Xuan sent Fang Zhichao, the Chief of Administrative Affairs of the Police Department, as his representative to various newspaper offices to express condolences to the beaten reporters. Today, they will continue to express condolences to the city councilors who were beaten and insulted during the mediation, and then express condolences to the stores of the various affected companies.

Yesterday, the two representatives from the City Government and Police Department first went to the Wenhui News to express condolences to reporter Li Houcheng, who was injured in the face by a police officer that day. Li happened to be out, so Director Fang and others left their cards and passed on their words. They then went to the Lao Zha Precinct to investigate the damaged stores for reference. Afterwards, they went to the Ta Kung Pao to express condolences to reporter Chen Tianci, and then to the Zhengyan News to express condolences to the newspaper's photographers Zhang Huchen and reporters Wang Yanlang and Yang Shiji. Because this newspaper's reporters suffered the most beatings, Fang and others specially asked Wang and Zhang to describe the situation in detail, which Director Fang personally recorded. Fang also said that Mayor Wu and Director Xuan were very angry when they heard that the reporters had been beaten, believing that newspaper reporters uphold justice for the people, and their duties are noble, but the police officers dared to despise them, which was absurd. The two police officers who beat the reporters at the time, numbers 4726 and 4144, will be severely punished. As for the duty officer who participated in the insult, their name will also be investigated, and Li, the section chief of the Huangpu Precinct, who was present and turned a blind eye, will be thoroughly investigated and dealt with one by one.

Director Ouyang and others then went to the United Evening News to express condolences to reporter Yao Fangzao, and finally to the Freedom Forum News to express condolences to reporter Wu Dong, all expressing apologies on behalf of Mayor Wu and Director Xuan.

### Year-End Approaching, Labor Disputes Increase; Workers Demand Year-End Bonuses; Disputes Awaiting Resolution; Zhao Banfu Says No Legal Basis

[Our Dispatch] As the year-end approaches, labor disputes in the city's industrial sector are increasing daily. As far as the reporter knows, the following cases have been submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation:

(1) China Tobacco Factory: The workers initially demanded a year-end bonus of 2 million yuan, which was rejected by the management, leading to a strike. Later, the Social Affairs Bureau gave the workers 24 hours to resume work before discussing the year-end bonus. The workers have now resumed work in compliance with the order, but their morale is low. The matter is scheduled for mediation at the Social Affairs Bureau tomorrow. The factory is adamant about not accepting the demand, but hopes to find a reasonable solution under the auspices of the bureau.

(2) Sullivan Confectionery and Biscuit Factory: Workers also demanded improved treatment, with the following specific requests: (1) An additional 150,000 yuan per person per month for living expenses.

(4) Payment of five days of pre-war accumulated working days. (5) Double pay for work on public holidays. (6) The factory should provide one meal per day. This matter was submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation on the 29th of last month, and has not yet been resolved.

(3) Huayi Wool Textile and Dyeing Factory: Workers demanded higher wages and improved welfare, with the following specific conditions: (1) Wages: The current highest wage is 100,000 yuan per month, with the average being around 50,000 yuan; they now demand that it be raised to a maximum of 200,000 yuan, with the average being around 150,000 yuan. (2) Wages should be paid for weekly holidays and national commemorative days. (3) In the event of a power outage, wage payments should be implemented in accordance with the methods promulgated by the Labor-Management Assessment Committee. (4) The treatment of female workers during maternity leave should be handled in accordance with the Factory Law. (5) If a worker is injured on the job, the factory should be responsible for medical expenses, and wages should also be paid. (6) Workers and workers' representatives should not be dismissed without cause. (7) The daily working hours are stipulated to be ten hours, and overtime should be compensated proportionally. This dispute occurred on October 18th. Yesterday, representatives from both labor and management negotiated at the Social Affairs Bureau, but no agreement was reached on the issue of raising wages.

(4) American Texaco Petroleum Company: Employees jointly requested the factory to improve treatment, and the content of the conditions was quite broad. The main points are as follows: (1) Due to the rising cost of living, it is requested that the base salary of employees be increased by 50% uniformly. (2) The base salary of employees below 100 yuan should be calculated according to the workers' cost of living index; those above 100 yuan should be paid according to the staff's cost of living index. (3) Double salary will be paid for one month during the Lunar New Year this year. (4) Daily working hours are limited to eight hours, and overtime should be paid double. (5) Employees, regardless of Chinese or foreign nationality, should be treated equally according to their grade in order to demonstrate impartiality.

(9) The company should build employee dormitories. (10) Kerosene should be distributed once a month uniformly. (11) Any worker who has served for three months should be considered a permanent employee. This matter was submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation on October 23rd. Texaco Company has sent a written reply to the bureau regarding the various conditions of the labor side; it agreed to handle the salary improvement request after investigating the cost of living; it agreed to handle the improvement of employee welfare as appropriate; as for the request to pay retirement pension and old-age pension, it said that it needed to discuss it with the company's directors before it could reply. Some points are vaguely worded and not affirmative, and the resolution is still pending.

(5) Racecourse: The workers yesterday bitterly complained to the Social Affairs Bureau about the Westerners' arrogant and bad attitude. Their specific demands are as follows: (1) Wages should be calculated according to the cost of living index and paid in three grades: Grade A is 55 yuan, Grade B is 51 yuan, and Grade C is 45 yuan. (2) The new treatment standard should be implemented from October. (3) Workers and workers' representatives shall not be dismissed on false pretenses. (4) Workers should have retirement pay. Those who have served for three years should receive six months' retirement pay; those who have served for five years, ten months; those who have served for ten years, one year; if the dismissal is proposed by the management, the retirement pay should be doubled. (5) If a worker is sick, the medical expenses should be borne by the management, and wages should not be deducted during the sick leave period. When a worker is sick, he/she may borrow three months' salary from the management. (6) The cost of workers' welfare facilities should be borne equally by both labor and management. (7) When the management hires new people, they should first hire unemployed workers from the labor union. (8) Employees should be paid double salary at the end of the year. This matter is still under the mediation of the Social Affairs Bureau, and the resolution is pending.

(6) Dagong Dyeing and Weaving Factory previously cancelled the repair department and laid off 31 workers, causing a labor-management conflict. After mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau, each laid-off worker was paid one month's severance pay and one and a half months' travel expenses, which was resolved.

(7) It is heard that the workers of the Central Printing Factory demanded the payment of year-end bonuses, but they have not yet submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation.

Director Zhao Banfu of the Social Affairs Bureau emphasized that the bureau is making the workers thoroughly understand that there is no legal basis for year-end bonuses, and that it is entirely a matter of pleading. If the factory has profits, can it be forced to uniformly issue a fixed amount of year-end bonuses? Furthermore, interfering with the factory's right to employ people is even more inappropriate. The Social Affairs Bureau's handling of this matter will be based on the principle of "labor and management co-existence," without oppressing the labor side, but also without forcing the factory to close down. The Social Affairs Bureau's policy for mediating labor disputes over the past year has been to promote labor-management cooperation, which is the only way out for China's industry.

Also, a reporter met a union official yesterday, who said: The "Machinist Research Society" organized by machinists in the city's machinery industry has decided to demand the payment of six months' year-end bonuses. The workers' attitude towards year-end bonuses is that they want more if the management earns more, and less if the management earns less, and they have no intention of forcing the factory to collapse.

### A Hundred-Year-Old Store Passed Down Through Four Generations: Gao Sheng's Paper Shop Presents a Grim Sight; Doors Nailed Shut with Wooden Boards: Temporarily Closed; Mayor Visits the Owner and Donates One Million

[Our Special Report] Gao Sheng Jianzhi Printing Shop, passed down through four generations and founded ninety-nine years ago, has unfortunately and innocently suffered repeated looting by rioters. All the equipment for making money was burned or destroyed, and even the clothes and bedding were looted. The total loss is more than 200 million. The second time rioters ran rampant the other day, even though the small shop owner kowtowed hundreds of times and pleaded bitterly, he not only failed to receive any sympathy from the rioters, but they even wanted to throw him into the fire to burn him. Fortunately, the shop assistants managed to pull him away and hide him, thus avoiding disaster.

Everywhere are Glass Shards. Yesterday afternoon, our reporter stepped on the paper scraps and went to the second floor of Gao Sheng's shop. In a small room, all the glass windows were riddled with holes. There, we met their business director, Lv Xuecheng. The old owner, Gao Chengxi, was out on business. The landlady, with red eyes and disheveled hair, sat on the edge of the bed, wiping away tears. At this time, the small shop owner Gao Pengyun (see picture) also came to tell the reporter the detailed story. Gao Pengyun is a fifth-year student at Tongde Medical College and is also an intern at Renji Hospital. He is the fourth-generation owner of Gao Sheng's shop and the one who kowtowed and pleaded with the rioters.

According to the victim's report, the details are as follows: At 11 AM on the 30th of last month, Lv Xuecheng and others saw a group of hooligan-like men in their twenties shouting at the entrance of the store: "To expand the matter, we must first cut off traffic." So, this group of people went to the nearby Zhonghua Alley and moved a few large stones onto the tram tracks. After a tram driver negotiated with them for a long time, they let him pass, but the following trams were not allowed to pass, and the order became more and more chaotic. The police drove a jeep to interfere, but were pelted with stones, and the situation escalated immediately. Gao Sheng, seeing the tense situation, put up all the door panels after 3 PM. Around 6 PM, just as they were preparing to eat dinner, they heard someone shouting below: "You poured boiling water on my head, that's outrageous! Hit, hit, hit!" Then, many people followed suit and shouted "Hit, hit, hit," thus causing a catastrophe. The reporter asked, "Did you actually pour water?" But the shop owner and shop assistants firmly denied it, saying that only the water pipe on the eaves was damaged, and the accumulated rainwater kept dripping down, and after the glass windows were broken by stones, the broken glass shards fell down and injured people's heads.

Get Out Quickly and Set Fire Immediately. After Gao Dasheng's door panel was broken through, Lv Xuecheng saw a person in uniform leading the way in. At first, he thought it was someone sent by the authorities to suppress the situation, but when he heard him ask aggressively what kind of person he was, and after being told that he was a worker in the shop, this person posing as a soldier said: "Get out quickly, and set fire immediately." The people who came with him even said they wanted to throw "Longjiao" (i.e., Lv Xuecheng) out of the window. Fortunately, someone nearby jokingly let him go. The landlady firmly refused to leave, and finally retreated. At this time, the boss was drinking at someone's house.

Groups of rioters threw the shop's account books, stationery, and lead type out into the street and burned them in piles. The machines and printing rooms were destroyed, and even the workers' quilts were looted. It stopped at 11 PM that night. Workers guarded the shop that night, and the police station sent four police officers to patrol at night, and finally only one person was left to guard. The remaining door panels were still propped up haphazardly.

The day before yesterday morning, Gao Sheng spent 110,000 yuan on labor costs (excluding bamboo fences and no compensation) to build the fence. Unfortunately, at 3:30 PM, a gust of wind brought rioters driving a truck to the scene. The truck was full of young people, and the leader wore a leather-collared short coat. As soon as the truck stopped, he directed them to dismantle the fence, shouting: "They actually built a fence, tear it down, burn, burn, burn!"

Small Boss Kneels and Almost Gets Burned Alive. At this time, all the people in the shop were hiding in the attic on the second floor. A large group of rioters rushed straight up and set all the books and account books on fire. The small shop owner, seeing them rush to the second floor, in order to protect the property on the second floor, repeatedly kowtowed to them, begging them not to destroy the second floor, and that they could destroy the storefront. At first, some people spared him and temporarily stopped. By the evening, there were more and more people, and the small shop owner kowtowed outside the door again, but no matter what, he could not move the hearts of the rioters. Instead, they said that he had been a military officer and wanted to throw him into the fire to burn him. The shop assistants became anxious and hurriedly pulled him away, telling him not to beg anymore, thus avoiding disaster. As a result, all eight printing presses were destroyed, the paper cutter was moved to the road to cut iron bars, and 4,000 pounds of lead type flew all over the street. People who took advantage of the fire to loot filled their bags with things they liked and left the scene. The heavy things were smashed and thrown around. One chartered car and one bicycle also became remnants of the fire. The bedding rolls were loaded into three tricycles and taken away. When the police came to interfere, the firefighters came to put out the fire several times, but were prevented from doing so.

Regarding the aftermath, the boss was so anxious that he had no way out. He could only clean up and prepare to nail up the wooden boards on the door and temporarily close the business. On one hand, he asked the Paper Industry Association to appeal to the City Chamber of Commerce. Mayor Wu summoned Gao Chengxi at 10 AM yesterday, expressing his deep apologies that the municipal authorities had failed to provide adequate protection, because the order was chaotic at the time and the police officers could not arbitrarily suppress it. He hoped that he would understand the situation, and the losses suffered would definitely be compensated in the future. He also donated 1 million in his personal name to provide comfort. Director Fang also went to express his condolences, saying: He was ordered by the Chairman to return and express condolences to all sectors of society, and will hold a fundraising event to compensate the shop for its losses.

As the reporter was about to leave, he heard the last few heartfelt words of the small shop owner, "We who run paper shops rely entirely on the sale of year-end account books. Our winter account books are all made in the summer. Now all the finished products have been burned, and even if we want to make them, it's too late!"

### The Abbot of Jing'an Temple Fights to Attend Court Hearings: De Wu and Mi Jia's Suspected Treason Case Heard Again Yesterday Afternoon; Five Teachers' Testimonies Divided into Two Factions

[Our Newspaper] The case of Jing'an Temple Abbot De Wu and Supervising Monk Mi Jia, suspected of being traitors, was heard again yesterday afternoon in the High Court.  Five witnesses were summoned: Li Haoran, Gu Longche, Xu Honghan, Yao Shaoxiu, and Chen Zhixin, all former teachers at Jing'an Elementary School.  The two defendants were also brought in for questioning.  Many monks from Jing'an Temple attended the hearing. The first two witnesses' testimonies were favorable to the defendants, while the latter three were unfavorable. The testimonies were completely contradictory. The hearing lasted from 3:00 PM to 5:30 PM, after which presiding judge Yang Dingyu announced a postponement for further questioning. The defendants were returned to custody.

Li Haoran stated that he began teaching at Jing'an Elementary School in August of the 32nd year of the Republic [1943] and resigned in May of the 34th year of the Republic [1945]. The school was not run by Jing'an Temple but by a board of directors. The land for the school was donated by Jing'an Temple. Mi Jia served as a standing director, and De Wu was a director. Tong Peng Japanese Language School was founded in the 31st year of the Republic [1942] and closed in April or May of the 34th year of the Republic [1945]. At the time, someone "with great power" wanted to take over Jing'an Elementary School. After much negotiation, it was agreed to lend classrooms to open a Japanese language night school. He did not know if the school was run by the enemy's Asia Development Board (興亞院). However, the wooden sign indicated that it was sponsored by the Japanese Higashi Honganji Temple (東本願寺). De Wu and Mi Jia did not teach classes. The principal was a Japanese man named Kinoshita Man'asen, but he did not come often. The school was separated from Jing'an Temple by a wall, with a small door that could be used for passage, but it was not often open. As for other matters, such as memorial services held by Jing'an Temple, because he was a Catholic, he did not usually concern himself with them, so he did not know the details.

Gu Longzhang stated that he taught at Jing'an Elementary School from August of the 32nd year of the Republic [1943] to August of the 34th year of the Republic [1945]. The school was originally attached to the temple, but later the temple donated land to build its own school building. Both De Wu and Mi Jia were directors. The recruitment advertisements, diplomas, and wooden signs for Tong Peng Japanese Language School claimed that it was run by Higashi Honganji Temple. Mi Jia and De Wu were not directors of the Japanese language school. When asked about the two defendants' interactions with Japanese people and the Jing'an Temple's hosting of ceremonies, Gu replied that he did not know.

Xu Honghan stated that he served as the director of administrative affairs and a teacher at Jing'an Elementary School for a total of seventeen years, resigning at the end of July last year. Mi Jia and De Wu only used Japanese influence to become directors of Jing'an Elementary School after the Pacific War, in November of the 32nd year of the Republic [1943]. Tong Peng Japanese Language School was jointly run by Higashi Honganji Temple and Jing'an Temple. In April of the 31st year of the Republic [1942], they forcibly borrowed elementary school classrooms, with a Japanese monk serving as principal. Water and electricity were used from Jing'an Elementary School, but the expenses were paid by Jing'an Temple. Mi Jia and De Wu often inspected the school and gave speeches at the beginning and end of the school year. The teachers were all Japanese. The recruitment advertisements stated that the school was registered with the Japanese Embassy, and so on. After speaking, he presented to the court the 8th session recruitment advertisement for the Japanese language night school brought by the accuser, Xie Xiqing. The advertisement was about five feet tall and consisted of two boards. On the back of one of them was a notice stating "Japanese Meiji Day - Holiday for One Day."

Yao Shaoxiu stated that from February of the 22nd year of the Republic [1933] to the end of July of the 34th year of the Republic [1945], he served as the head of general affairs and a teacher at Jing'an Elementary School. Before the War of Resistance, there was no board of directors. After the Pacific War, Mi Jia and De Wu relied on enemy puppet forces and insisted on joining the board of directors, becoming directors in November of the 32nd year of the Republic [1943]. Before entering Jing'an Temple, Mi Jia presided over Xizhu Temple (西竺寺) in Hongkou and had close ties with Higashi Honganji Temple, using this influence to enter Jing'an Temple and establish the Japanese language school. In April of the 31st year of the Republic [1942], De Wu and Mi Jia, along with Japanese monks from Higashi Honganji Temple, personnel from the Asia Development Board's military police unit, and Japanese police chief Sugisaki from the puppet Jing'an Temple police station, as well as chief of the Baojia (保甲) system Sakiya, forcibly occupied Jing'an Elementary School. After this, although nominally it was called a joint operation between the temples, it was actually managed by De Wu and Mi Jia. Principal Zhifeng was just a puppet, only coming once at the time of the founding in June of the 31st year of the Republic [1942]. At the opening ceremony, Zhifeng spoke first, followed by Mi Jia and De Wu. Mi Jia gave a detailed account of the meaning of the founding, saying that he wanted to integrate the ideas of China, Japan, and Manchuria and promote cultural exchange. De Wu said: Shanghai can be so stable today entirely thanks to the Japanese. If you learn Japanese well, you can be introduced to work in Japanese agencies. In addition, Jing'an Temple held Buddhist lectures, and Chen Binhe was invited to speak. I can vouch for my words, and if I am falsely accusing them, I can be prosecuted. He also presented two pieces of evidence.

Chen Zhixin stated that he taught at Jing'an Elementary School and served as the director of student affairs for a period of time from the start of the war in the 26th year of the Republic [1937] until February of the 32nd year of the Republic [1943]. On a certain day in April of the 31st year of the Republic [1942], Mi Jia came with Japanese people to forcibly occupy the school. Although the principal on the graduation diplomas of the Japanese language night school was Zhifeng, Mi Jia was actually in charge, and De Wu was just a puppet. The small door between Jing'an Temple and Jing'an Elementary School was only opened after the establishment of the Tong Peng Japanese Language School. Mi Jia not only lectured at Tong Peng, but also came to Jing'an Elementary School to lecture, talking about how "the Greater East Asia War" was something or other. He was really angry and couldn't take it anymore. He spoke with great agitation.

Defendants' Statements

After the five witnesses were questioned, Judge Yang ordered De Wu and Mi Jia to be brought in. De Wu, dressed in a gray cloth monk's robe and looking thin, responded to the two Japanese language school recruitment signs presented by the accuser, saying: If they want to sue me, they can write it themselves. There is absolutely no such thing as providing all the funds for Tong Peng. The small door between Jing'an Temple and Jing'an Elementary School was already open before the Tong Peng Japanese Language School was established. Mi Jia, dressed in a black monk's robe, argued: I never participated in Tong Peng in any capacity. The recruitment advertisements mentioned by the accuser could be written on paper and are not sufficient evidence. Jing'an Temple only subsidized the elementary school's expenses and did not subsidize the Japanese language school's expenses. "If you want to condemn someone, you can always find a charge." The law must focus on facts. Xu, Yao, and Chen are giving false testimonies because of a grudge. Please also consider the opinions of the first two witnesses. One of the accusers, Buddhist monk Yang Xi, said during the enemy puppet period that we were Chongqing elements, and as a result, we were all detained by the enemy military police. After the victory, they said we were traitors. Recently, I heard that Liu Gen and others wanted to forcibly enter Jing'an Temple, so the accusation is false, and it's just a fight over property.

Request for Bail

The defendants' defense lawyer refuted the evidence presented by the three witnesses who were unfavorable to the defendants, saying that it was clearly false testimony. Furthermore, because the management of Jing'an Temple is currently in disarray and there is no one to preside over it, he requested that the court still grant bail. Mi Jia also said: I have absolutely no intention of escaping. The court ordered a written application to be submitted and stated that it would be decided by the collegial panel of the court. The defendants were still remanded in custody. By the time the court adjourned, all the lights were on in the city.

### Puppet Secret Agent Robs U.S. Dollars: District Court Tries Enemy Puppet Unresolved Case

[Our Newspaper] The District Court yesterday tried a case of a puppet secret agent robbing U.S. dollars and making threats before the victory. In the autumn of the 34th year of the Republic [1945], two Jewish men, Hadmon and Spiro, secretly bought and sold U.S. dollars. At that time, the Japanese army strictly controlled U.S. dollars and legal tender. Therefore, two puppet secret agents surnamed Chen and Fan entrusted a coal briquette shop owner named Wu Qixian to falsely tell the Jewish men that they wanted to buy 200 U.S. dollars, and said that they would lead them to get the money. They lured them to the intersection of Huoshan Road and Dasuwan Road, where Chen and Fan stepped forward and confiscated the U.S. dollars. They then went to Spiro's house to search and seized more than 280 U.S. dollars and more than 800,000 puppet Central Reserve Bank notes (偽中儲券). Afterwards, Ha and Si reported the matter to the puppet court. However, the puppet court delayed the trial. It was not until yesterday that the District Court held its first hearing. Because so much time had passed, it was necessary to collect more evidence, and the court ordered a postponement for further trial on December 11.

### Li Ze Case to be Retried Tomorrow: Accusers Publish Open Letter and Submit Another Complaint

[Our Newspaper] Li Ze, the general manager of Xinxin Company (新新公司), was accused of treason by employees of the company, including Shu Yueqiao, after the victory. The High Court of this city concluded the trial and sentenced him to three years of imprisonment. The defendant disagreed with the verdict and his wife, Li Liu Zhaoxing, filed a petition with the Supreme Court in Nanjing, requesting a retrial. The court ruled that the original verdict was inappropriate and remanded the case for a new trial. The High Court of this city has now scheduled a retrial for tomorrow afternoon.

The Supreme Court's reasons for remanding the case for a new trial were: (1) Regarding the hiring of Japanese nationals Ito Masamitsu and Kinoshita Yutaka as consultants, the original verdict did not explain whether the defendant had contacted the enemy army, whether the consultants were entrusted to handle matters, what the facts and content were, and whether he admitted to colluding with the enemy with intentions detrimental to the country, which was an oversight. (2) The original verdict did not implement the investigation procedures in accordance with the law, did not read the verdict to the defendant, did not inform him of the main points, and did not ask him for his opinions, thus depriving the defendant of the opportunity to defend himself. (3) The original verdict did not explain the basis for citing the wartime economic regulations promulgated by the puppet Nanjing government, the provisional regulations of the puppet General Chamber of Commerce, and the China-Japan Joint Declaration. The defendant was unaware of these matters beforehand and could not use them as a basis for defense.

Furthermore, the accusers in the Li Ze case, Shu Yueqiao, Han Wucheng, Ye Qiubin, Xu Kekang, and others, considering that Li Ze would be retried by the Second Criminal Division of the High Court tomorrow, specifically invited the press to the Xinxin Company Colleagues' Association at 16 Fengji Lane at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, and published an open letter to the National Assembly representatives and the Municipal Council, listing Li Ze's crimes and emphasizing that he had contributed more than 20,000 catties of iron to support the enemy, requesting that they uphold justice. The letter was sent out last night. It is also understood that Shu Yueqiao, Han Wucheng, and others have asked lawyer Sha Qianli to draft a complaint, which will be personally presented to Judge Yang Ding at the opening of the trial as evidence.

### Meeting of the Directors and Supervisors of the Association of Comrades Who Suffered in the War to Count Ballots This Afternoon

The second general meeting of members of the Association of Comrades Who Suffered in the War in this city was held at the Jindu Grand Theater the day before yesterday. The situation was enthusiastic. It was originally planned to elect directors and supervisors on the spot, but due to time constraints, the ballots could not be counted. It is now scheduled to count the ballots at 11:00 AM today at the association's headquarters at 557 Hedde Road. In addition to appointing member representatives to supervise the ballots, count the ballots, and write the ballots, all members are free to participate. Furthermore, the association's presentation of commemorative medals for martyrs who died for their country, on behalf of all sectors of Shanghai to commemorate the July 7th Incident, has also begun. The families of all martyred heroes can go directly to the association to receive them as a memorial.

### Public Education Personnel Have Not Lost Hope: Military Blankets May Be Distributed Soon

The Municipal Council's second joint meeting made several resolutions to improve the operations of the distribution office. This reporter specifically visited the person in charge of the office. According to him: He is very grateful for the instructions from the Municipal Council and stated: (1) 1,500 sets of uniforms have already been made and distributed. The remaining 300 or so sets can be completed and distributed this week. There is no such thing as not making them. Regarding the Municipal Government's General Affairs Department entrusting a business to produce 3,000 sets of Melton wool uniforms from the U.S., the goods have not arrived due to a strike by dockworkers in the U.S., or this is a misunderstanding. (2) Military blankets will be allocated by the office for distribution as soon as the Supply Bureau decides on the method. (3) It is hoped that domestic goods manufacturers will supply as many affordable daily necessities as possible for distribution. (4) Procedures will be simplified, and it will be possible to pay for goods and receive them immediately. Also, the next items to be distributed may be military blankets.

### Two Japanese War Criminals Transferred to Military Court

[Our Newspaper] The military court of the First Pacification District yesterday took into custody two war criminals transferred from the War Criminals Management Office, Tanaka Kanichi and Tachibana Tsurugoro, both former members of the Xiang-E District military police.

### The O'Hara Bureau Case Continues: The Secretary of the German Consulate's Testimony is Evasive

[Our Newspaper] The O'Hara Bureau spy case has now reached the stage of investigating activities in Guangzhou. Yesterday, the witness who testified was Brillisson, the former secretary of the German Consulate in Guangzhou. This person's words were evasive, and he repeatedly avoided answering questions directly, causing prosecutor Major Duval to become agitated and repeatedly question him sternly. Later, the court warned Brillisson that he must be responsible for his testimony, and the atmosphere in the courtroom eased. Lawyer Yang Linzhi was still not in court yesterday. According to French lawyer Prime, the Japanese witness Nakagawa, who was detained a few days ago, was released that afternoon, so he continued to serve as defense counsel the next day. As for lawyer Yang, he may not appear in court again for other reasons.

Furthermore, after the Guangzhou witnesses in this case have been questioned, there are still more than a dozen witnesses from Beijing to testify, so the entire case will take at least three more weeks to conclude.

### The Cold Shelter on Tongzhou Road Will Begin Accepting People on the 7th

[Our Newspaper] The Tongzhou Road cold shelter, sponsored by the city's Winter Relief Committee, held its first administrative meeting on the 1st. Due to the cold weather, it has been decided to start accepting people on December 7th (according to central regulations, it should start on December 16th). All supplies, food, and clothing have been actively prepared. The repair work and water, electricity, stoves, bathrooms, and toilet projects in the shelter are all being overseen by personnel from the Public Works Bureau. According to the Social Affairs Bureau: Before the cold shelter is established, the bureau's Caohjing refugee and orphan shelter will do its best to accommodate people to meet urgent needs.

### China Merchants Electric Company Leases Machines to Generate its Own Electricity

The China Merchants Electric Company's generators were completely dismantled and destroyed by the enemy during the war. Since the victory, the company's power supply has been entirely dependent on the Shanghai Electric Power Company, which has resulted in a heavy burden on the power company. The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities has repeatedly urged the China Merchants Company to generate its own electricity to alleviate the power shortage. It is now learned that the company has leased a 1,440-kilowatt power generation equipment from the Shanghai Cement Company and signed a lease agreement on November 9th. It is understood that the Bureau of Public Utilities has ordered the China Merchants Company to complete the installation by mid-December and restore its own power generation.

### 60 Million Yuan Loan: Gold Factory as Collateral: Debtor Denies Investigation by District Prosecutor's Office

[Our Newspaper] On November 29th, the Changning District Police Station of this city accepted a complaint from citizen Chen Ziju. According to his report, his friend Sun Pingjiang borrowed 10 million Legal Tender (法幣) from him on September 2nd, with a term of half a month, and issued a check from the Central Trust of China Bank (中匯銀行) dated September 17th.

On September 16th, Sun went to Chen's father's place with a 10 million Central Trust of China Bank check under his own name and exchanged it for the Juxingcheng Bank check. However, all the checks were returned when due, and after several unsuccessful negotiations with Sun, he refused to settle the matter for a month. On the 29th of last month, Sun even denied that he had issued a mortgage agreement or borrowed money. The police station, considering that Sun Pingjiang had paid Chen Ziju 6 million Legal Tender in interest, indicating that a debt relationship did exist between Chen and Sun, transferred the entire case to the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday for investigation according to law.

### Material Supply Bureau Guards Search Crew Members of the Hai Xiang Ship

China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (招商局) Files Serious Protest

[Our Newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ship "Hai Xiang" was previously leased by the Material Supply Bureau. It sailed from Shanghai to Okinawa on the 8th of last month. After arriving on the island on the 10th at noon, it sailed to Okishiro Bay and other places, and returned to Shanghai on the morning of the 30th of last month. It transported vehicles and machinery from Okinawa and docked at the Qiujiang Wharf for unloading.

### Zhenru Machinery Factory Embezzlement Case: Deputy Factory Director Suspected and Arrested: UNRRA Expresses Willingness to Cooperate with Our Authorities to Investigate

[Our Newspaper] The Zhenru Machinery Factory of UNRRA (United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) recently had an embezzlement case where UNRRA housing materials worth 20 million Legal Tender were stolen and sold. Five Chinese employees of the factory have been arrested. Later, it was discovered that the factory's deputy director, Hubert R. Heath, an American, was also a suspect. The police station arrested him last Saturday and transferred him to the District Court for interrogation. According to Article 32, Section 3 of the UNRRA document, "The participating governments agree to exempt UNRRA staff from judicial proceedings in their territories for negligence occurring in the exercise of their official duties. However, for acts outside the scope of their official duties, and when not exercising their official duties, they shall not be exempt from their individual legal responsibilities." Since Heath, as a UNRRA employee in China, has violated the law, our courts naturally have the right to try him.

UNRRA authorities here have interrogated Heath and found his statements unsatisfactory. They have expressed their willingness to cooperate with the Chinese authorities to investigate this embezzlement case.

### Reader Consultation

Medical and Health

(1) Hearing Loss in Both Ears

Hang Fangyu first asked whether I was generally healthy, but after suffering from malignant malaria in April of this year, I have suffered from anemia, neurasthenia, and other symptoms. In July, I came to Hangzhou from my hometown. The journey was arduous, and I was extremely exhausted. I had blood in my stool, and my urination was painful. I discovered that I had leucorrhea (I have never been involved with prostitutes). I took two bottles of "Uleron" pills and was cured. However, in the past week, I have had difficulty hearing, and I seem to have hearing loss. I ask (1) Is it possible that my wife's leucorrhea could have been transmitted to her husband and turned into leucorrhea? What medicine should I take to eradicate it? (2) What is the cause of the hearing difficulty?

(Answer from Dr. Zhang Zhongming) (1) Leucorrhea is caused by physical weakness or local inflammation. It may be infected with gonorrhea diplococcus. You should take Sulfadizine pills or inject Penicillin. (2) The hearing difficulty may be caused by taking an excessive amount of Uleron pills.

Treatment by Chinese medicine was ineffective. He is now recuperating at home. I would like to ask the following three questions: (1) Is this condition dangerous? What is the name of the disease? (2) How should this condition be treated to be effective? (3) If left untreated, will it cause adverse consequences? Is it necessary to take supplements?

(Answer from Dr. Zhang Zhongming) (1) The disease is called spinal tuberculosis. If it is not cured early, there is a risk of becoming disabled or developing tuberculous meningitis. (2) A plaster cast should be applied or he should lie on a hard bed. (3) At the same time, attention should be paid to nutrition and more supplements should be taken.

### Fourth Period Yarn Allocation: First Phase Started Yesterday; Standards Revised for Allocation to National and Private Factories; Adjusted Conversion Ratios and Negotiated Prices

[Our report] The joint distribution of cotton yarn to the Restoring Party by national and private yarn factories for the first phase of the fourth period began yesterday. However, there have been slight changes in the details of yarn allocation compared to the past: (1) The calculation of the conversion ratio of each count of yarn to 20-count yarn. Because the previously set calculation table was not very accurate, a new, more precise statistical table has been formulated. (2) The allocation of yarn to national and private factories is now based on the actual number of spindles opened by each factory. Based on the 709,316 spindles opened by the China Textile Construction Corporation and the 1,011,809 spindles opened by private factories, the China Textile Construction Corporation should be allocated slightly more than two-fifths of the total yarn, and private factories should be allocated slightly less than one-fifth. (3) According to the original negotiated price, 42-count single-strand yarn was quoted at 2.77 million yuan per piece, and 42-count double-strand yarn was quoted at 2.79 million yuan per piece, a difference of 20,000 yuan, which was obviously inappropriate. The new price for 42-count double-strand yarn has been set at 3.46 million yuan per piece based on production costs and submitted to the Textile Control Commission for approval before implementation.

Yesterday, the total amount of cotton yarn jointly distributed by national and private yarn factories was 5,181 pieces, equivalent to 6,160.26 pieces of 20-count yarn. This included 30 pieces of 6-count yarn, 684 pieces of 10-count yarn, 415 pieces of 16-count yarn, 2,940 pieces of 20-count yarn, 270 pieces of 32-count yarn, 150 pieces of 32-count double-strand yarn, 130 pieces of 40-count TK yarn, 119 pieces of 40-count yarn, 436 pieces of 42-count double-strand yarn, and 7 pieces of 60-count yarn.

The China Textile Construction Corporation was allocated an estimated 1,507 pieces of the above total amount of cotton yarn. The counts and prices of cotton yarn are as follows: 20-count Caiqiu, Shuiyue, and Riguang tube yarn, 200 pieces of each, totaling 600 pieces, at 1.75 million yuan per piece. 32-count Longmen Dabao, 200 pieces, at 2.32 million yuan per piece. 32-count double-strand Xiantao tube yarn, 150 pieces, at 2.61 million yuan per piece. 40-count Baoguang Caobao, 100 pieces, at 2.77 million yuan per piece. 40-count TK Caiqiu tube yarn, 50 pieces, at 4.12 million yuan per piece. 42-count double-strand Lima tube thread, 170 pieces, at 2.79 million yuan per piece. 42-count double-strand Baoguang Caobao, 130 pieces, at 2.79 million yuan per piece. 42-count double-strand Lanfeng Dabao, 100 pieces, at 2.79 million yuan per piece. 60-count Riguang tube yarn, 7 pieces, at 5.15 million yuan per piece. The prices of the above 42-count double-strand yarn are yet to be adjusted.

As for the 1,500 pieces of cotton yarn sold to yarn retailers, the China Textile Construction Corporation was allocated 618 pieces, and private factories were allocated 882 pieces.

### Despite Heavy Pressure from the Central Bank, the Gold Market Continues to Rise; US Dollar Weakens After Initial Strength

Yesterday, the Central Bank continued to tighten controls. After a high opening, trading turned volatile. Opening at 2.733 million, there was a rush to buy, and the price gradually rose, soon reaching over 2.76 million. After a period of hovering, buyers gained the upper hand, and the price rose again to over 2.77 million before pressure pushed it down slightly. After 10:00 am, the Central Bank allocated 40 bars at a price of 2.75 million, and the pressure continued, with repeated sales, leading to a change in the situation. At noon, the price fell back to 2.715 million. In the afternoon, the supply of sources became sluggish again, and sentiment reversed. Next-day delivery rose again to around 2.755 million, an increase of 31,000 compared to last Saturday. Gold ornaments were listed at 990,000. Silver bullion and silver dollars remained flat. Shadow interest rates remained flat. Interest rates ranged from 1.2 to 1.5 jiao.

Foreign currencies weakened after initial strength. The US dollar opened at 4,920 yuan to 4,970 yuan, and at one point approached 5,000 yuan. Later, due to the decline in the gold market, it was also affected, and at noon it fell to below 4,900 yuan. Although it rose in the afternoon, the increase was not significant, hovering around 4,900 yuan. As a result, it fell slightly compared to last Saturday. The Hong Kong exchange rate rose to over 970 yuan due to the drop in Shen Dian and the tying up of Western merchants. The Indian exchange rate was 1,180 yuan, and the British exchange rate was 15,800 yuan. The official exchange rate for the US dollar remained unchanged, and there was still no counterpart trading.

### Bond Market Stagnant

The bond market was even more stagnant yesterday. Only a few hundred thousand of the popular Unified Bing bonds were traded. There were no transactions in miscellaneous bonds. Therefore, the asking price was only slightly different from last Saturday. The Unified Bing bonds opened at 1,360 yuan, with the lowest price at 1,350 yuan, and then rose back to 1,390 yuan. Finally, it struggled between 1,380 yuan and 1,290 yuan, resulting in a decrease of 30 yuan compared to last Saturday.

### Premier Song to Personally Preside Over Today's Textile Control Meeting

[Our report] Premier Song's visit to Shanghai this time has brought great attention to the production, sales, and distribution of cotton yarn in the city, as well as the procurement of national and American cotton. It has been decided that Mr. Song will personally preside over the 14th regular meeting of the Textile Control Commission at the Bank of China Building at 11:00 am today. It is expected that important instructions will be given regarding the policy on cotton yarn in the city.

### Over-the-Counter Prices for Cotton Yarn Remain High; Cloth Merchants Continue to Actively Sell at Special Prices

Yesterday, the yarn market was initially depressed but then rebounded. There was strong demand for 20-count yarn from buyers, and there was also a large supply for sale. However, due to the high prices of fine yarn and double-strand thread, buyers were reluctant to purchase. Over-the-counter prices were quoted at 5.25 million for 42-count Lanfeng, 3.25 million for 32-count Lanfeng, 3.15 million for Yinyue, 2.65 million for 20-count Te Shuangma, and 2.4 million for Da Feiting, which is 20,000 to 30,000 higher than last week.

The offloading of cotton cloth to various areas along the Yangtze River continued to be active. Merchants from Tianjin and Hankou also absorbed some supply. The market was slightly bullish due to the Lunar New Year season. High-end shirting was quoted at 162,000 yuan, and Longtou fine cloth was quoted at 99,000 yuan. Biji and Zhigong were slightly higher.

### Release of Seized Goods; Increased Transactions in Woolen Fabrics

Although the woolen fabric market showed a slight improvement compared to the previous day, with increased transactions in the early morning, it was difficult for standard prices to improve. This was because of the abundant supply of goods and the influence of interest rates on seized goods. Both buyers and sellers adopted a cautious approach. High-quality all-wool woolen fabrics, overcoat wool, suit wool, Harris Tweed, and Homburg were generally released by those who deal in seized goods, due to seasonal factors, interest rates, and fixed delivery dates.

### White Coal Continues to Rise

The coal market saw sustained sales of white coal lump, and prices continued to rise. Due to the depletion of inventory of white coal dust, Hongji dust has risen to 320,000 yuan per ton, and there are still few sellers. The market for bituminous coal was relatively weak because industry players heard that the Fuel Control Commission had sent a letter to the association to investigate the coal stocks of various industry players, but the market price remained flat.

### Rice Market Firm; Cooking Oil Prices Plummet

The rice market saw a total of over 9,000 shi of rice arriving from the north and south. Early rice and Bo rice were relatively scarce, while Su Tong粳 and Bei粳 were more abundant. Xian rice was still scarce, and the market was relatively stable. High-quality Bei粳 rose slightly by 300 to 500 yuan, Nan粳 rose by 1,000 yuan, Su Tong粳 was similar, and Xian rice remained firm due to scarcity. Bai阴元 remained flat and fair, with little price fluctuation. The cooking oil market saw a surge of supplies from various sources, with crude oil falling sharply by 8,000 to 9,000 yuan, soybean oil falling by 6,000 to 7,000 yuan, and sesame oil also falling by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. There was a strong selling sentiment as supply exceeded demand. Yellow beans remained flat, broad beans hovered in a state of weakness, green beans remained stable, red beans were similar, red sorghum was in demand from distilleries and showed a bullish trend, string beans were being purchased in Shantou, and prices rose by over 2,000 yuan. Sesame from Guangzhou continued to be transacted, and prices remained firm. Raw peanuts from Southeast Asia remained unchanged, corn was similar, soybean cake was quiet in Minhua, and Shantou and Xiamen were active but not strong, with fluctuating prices, but the changes were minimal. The supply of wheat was scarce, and prices rose by 300 to 500 yuan. Flour sales were average, but arrivals were not abundant. Wheat bran digestion was sluggish, falling by 200 to 300 yuan, and the outlook remained bearish.

### Initial Weakness Followed by Rise in Chinese Stocks; Yong Yarn Breaks 500 Yuan Barrier

Chinese stocks initially declined yesterday due to the unsettling impact of the city's disorder on public sentiment, but many parties seized the opportunity to rise and continuously increase their positions, leading to a rebound. Short sellers faced resistance at higher levels, and ultimately the market became uncertain. Chang Kai stocks initially declined, but there was buying interest in stock No. 232 after the opening, leading to a sudden improvement in sentiment. Stocks No. 67, 36, 177, and 30 were also bought, triggering an upward trend. The supply of shares dried up, and buying sentiment became increasingly enthusiastic, leading to higher prices. At high prices, stocks No. 176 and 199 were sold at higher levels, and merchants from Guangzhou also supplied shares. As a result, the 500 yuan barrier for Yong yarn was initially met with some resistance, but ultimately stock Nos. 8 and 9 advanced, and after stock No. 199 was sold and then repurchased, the 500 yuan barrier was finally broken, and high prices appeared. Subsequently, stock No. 151 frequently exerted pressure, but struggled repeatedly at the 500 yuan level. There was active over-the-counter supply, and stock No. 151 continued to sell, while stock No. 92 of Yong yarn also sold, and stocks No. 38 and 82 sold to Xinnuo. Near noon, there were some profit-taking and a slight decline in sentiment. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yong yarn, Meiya, and Huafeng rose slightly, while Xinnuo, Jingfu, and Qinxing declined slightly, Xinguang remained flat, and Rongfeng, a less popular stock, rose slightly, Datong Match remained flat, and the rest declined slightly. For the next-day delivery, Yong yarn and Huafeng rose slightly, and the rest declined slightly. In the afternoon, the market turned bearish, and there was a constant stream of over-the-counter supply. Stocks No. 2, 8, 9, 176, and 157 were sold. At lower prices, merchants from Guangzhou and others supported and rebounded. After the close, asking prices stabilized slightly. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Yong yarn, Xinguang, Qinxing, and Huafeng declined slightly, Meiya, Xinnuo, and Jingfu each fell by about half a percent, Datong Match, a less popular stock, remained flat, China Silk declined significantly by slightly less than ten percent, and the rest declined slightly. For the next-day delivery, Yong yarn, Qinxing, and Huafeng declined slightly, and Meiya, Xinnuo, and Xinguang each fell by about half a percent. Over-the-counter stocks remained relatively stable.

### China Farmers Bank Convenes Meeting for 1947 Tea Loans; Formulating National Tea Loan Plan for Next Year

In order to support the export industry and balance international receipts and payments, the China Farmers Bank has organized various tea loans this year, but only in three regions: Tunxi, Pinglu, and Wenzhou. Fujian, Yunnan, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Sichuan provinces are also tea-producing regions. In order to encourage exports, the bank has decided to expand tea loans next year and implement them nationwide. A meeting for 1947 tea loans was convened in Shanghai yesterday (the 1st). In addition to reviewing this year's tea loan business, the meeting also discussed the plan for universally implementing tea loans next year. The important topics of discussion included: (1) Estimating the production volume in each region for 1947; (2) Coordinating the loan amounts for purchasing raw tea in each region for 1947; (3) Coordinating agricultural production loans for 1947; (4) Export issues. Other proposals included purchasing procedures, warehousing, transportation, and other matters. After this meeting, a concrete plan for tea loans for next year will be formulated based on each topic and submitted for approval before implementation. The plan for next year will provide loans for all aspects of the tea industry, including production, purchasing, transportation, and export. The loans will be divided into: (1) Production loans, which will be lent to tea farmers for production; (2) Purchasing and tea-making loans, which will be lent to tea manufacturers for purchasing and making refined finished products; (3) Transportation and sales loans, which will be lent to tea merchants for transportation and sales, divided into export documentary bills and loan collateral; (4) Export documentary bills, which will be lent to tea merchants for transporting tea from export ports to foreign countries. These loans will be used for rapid circulation. The biggest difficulty in tea exports is the high cost, and high-interest loans are a major reason. The current cost of Qimen black tea is about 500,000 yuan per dan, and the burden of black market interest accounts for almost a quarter of the cost. The same is true in Pinglu and Tunxi. In order to open up foreign markets, reducing costs is the biggest key. According to an authority in the tea industry, reducing costs is only one aspect. Other factors, such as personnel management and unnecessary waste, are also factors that increase costs. It is hoped that industry players will conduct a thorough review themselves and work together to survive and save the crisis under the painstaking assistance of the government and the Farmers Bank.

### Start of Mortgage for Stored Tea

In order to promote national policy and alleviate the difficulties of tea merchants, the China Farmers Bank began to mortgage over 20,000 boxes of Shanghai tea in its tea loan portfolio yesterday, stipulating a uniform 30% discount on cost and 3% interest.

In addition, the issue of purchasing has already been submitted to the Ministry of Finance and Economics for review by the tea merchants in a joint name.

### International Bank for Reconstruction and Development Maintains Independence; No Single Country Can Determine Policy; Also Avoids Conflicting with Any Country's Policy

[United Press International, Washington, 1st] International Bank for Reconstruction and Development President McCloy, in response to a question at a press conference about the US halting a $90 million line of credit to Czechoslovakia, said that the bank would strive to avoid allowing any one country to determine its policies, and at the same time must avoid conflicting with the policies of any one country. This move by the United States was due to the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia's demand that US lending policies not restrict borrowing countries. According to the Bank President, the Bank may issue at least two types of securities to fund proposed loans. Seven countries have already notified the Bank of their intention to apply for credit. One type of security will be short-term, low-interest bonds, and the other will be long-term, high-interest bonds. McCloy said that most of the bonds would be sold in the United States, but if investors in other countries obtain permission from their governments, they may also subscribe to the International Bank's public bonds. The American business newspaper "The Wall Street Journal" said that investors will receive the International Bank's first notice of bond issuance at the end of November.

### Increased Exchange Rates in South China to Prevent Capital Flight

The internal exchange rates of national banks were revised by the small group of the Four Banks Joint Treasury on the 30th. There have been increases and decreases in North and South China. The exchange rate for Guangzhou in South China has increased from 15 yuan to 28 yuan. Shantou and Shaozhou have increased from 25 yuan to 45 yuan. The rest of South China has increased from 30 yuan to 50 yuan, an increase of more than 90%. North China, on the other hand, has been reduced. Lianyungang has been reduced from 25 yuan to 20 yuan, and Qingdao has been reduced from 12 yuan to 10 yuan. The provinces and cities of Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Hebei remain the same. It is reported that the increase in exchange rates in South China is due to the large amount of capital fleeing from Guangzhou and other places. This measure is a means of preventing capital flight.

### Government to Establish Regulatory Commission to Develop National Silk Industry; Representatives of Silk Reeling Industry Petition in Nanjing

Faced with difficulties in both export sales and raw materials, China's silk industry is facing a complete shutdown. The current solution is to obtain 10 million pounds of Japanese dried cocoons through barter, which will last until the spring cocoon market next year. If raw materials cannot be obtained, silk reeling factories in various places will inevitably close, which will affect the silk weaving factories, the rural economy, the lives of workers, and even part of the financial industry. Therefore, the Silk Reeling Industry Association decided at the board of directors meeting on the 28th to send Chu Fucheng, Leng [blank], Shen Juru, Wang Huanan, Zhou Yuanxun, and others to Nanjing to petition the President of the Executive Yuan and the heads of various ministries, requesting two points: (1) The cost of autumn cocoons (including a profit of 500,000 yuan) is 6.4 million yuan per dan, while the market price of raw silk is only 60% of the cost. Although the China Trust Bureau has raised the purchase price of each grade by 400,000 yuan per dan, it is still far from enough. Therefore, it is hoped that the government will determine the purchase price based on the production cost of raw silk and that the China Trust Bureau will be responsible for continuing to purchase; (2) The industry has contacted our Ambassador to the United States, Gu Weijun, regarding the shipment of Japanese cocoons to China, asking him to directly negotiate with the authorities in Washington, but there has been no response. It is hoped that the government will actively negotiate with MacArthur to prevent the silk industry from falling into a desperate situation.

According to the China Silk Corporation, its General Manager Ge Jingzhong has just come to Shanghai from Nanjing and said that the government will establish a National Silk Industry Regulatory Commission in 1947 to supervise the improvement and management of the entire silk industry nationwide, so as to plan development under unified control.

### Slight Decrease in Raw Sugar and White Sugar

Yesterday, in the sugar market, only Zhongsha white sugar was relatively soft, while the rest were stable. The association's current spot price for Zhongsha white sugar was 133,500 yuan, a decrease of 1,000 yuan. Raw sugar was 115,000 yuan.

A total of several hundred lots were traded.

### Scarce and Valuable Chen Qimen Tea

The stock of high-end Qimen tea, in the foreign tea market, has long been scarce. Furthermore, since the British merchant's foreign action last week, the stock has almost been exhausted. Still, yesterday the market saw many buyer accounts, but few transactions were made. The price trend is feared to be the highest. The export capacity of other teas is narrow, and the prices are suppressed severely, while there are still those who want to sell them, so the process remains depressed. The market for the colorless new large grade tea desired by the Americas is still calm, due to low prices offered. Tea merchants are in constant contact via telephone to request price increases, the result of which should come in a few days.

### Four Banks Joint Treasury Approves Provincial Banks to Handle Production Loans; Can Apply for Re-mortgage; But Surplus Funds Should Also Be Deposited in National Banks

[Our report from Nanjing, 2nd] Provincial banks have recently complained that they do not have sufficient capital to handle loans for local production enterprises, so they asked national banks to provide interbank lending. It is now known that this proposal has been approved by the Four Banks Joint Treasury. Provincial banks, when handling loans for agricultural, forestry, industrial, mining, water conservancy, and other production enterprises related to local economic construction, may apply to national banks for re-mortgages and discounts if their own capital is insufficient. When necessary, the cases for which the provincial banks intend to apply to the national banks for re-mortgages and re-discounts should be submitted to the Four Banks Joint Treasury for approval before handling. However, provincial banks should deposit their surplus funds in local national banks. In places where there are no national banks, they should deposit them in other national banks and not in commercial banks.

### Ministry of Education Provides Key Points for Compiling National Education Funding

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] The Ministry of Education considers national education to be the foundation of nation-building. However, in recent years, the funding for primary schools in various regions has been stretched. Especially after the changes in the fiscal revenue and expenditure system, many provinces have reduced their national education funding due to various difficulties. Therefore, the Ministry of Education has issued a general order to the education departments of various provinces, providing two key points that should be noted when compiling national education funding: (1) The national education funding should be included in the provincial education budget. In addition to subsidizing national schools in various counties (cities) to improve their facilities, special subsidies should be provided to primary schools with funding shortages and excellent performance. (2) The budget for education funding in each county (city) should not be lower than the percentage of the budget in the 26th year of the Republic. In addition, if possible, efforts should be made to raise sufficient funds to implement the universal education plan in stages.

### Shanghai's Social Education Work in the Past Year

[Our Dispatch] Wang Ruchang, Director of the Social Education Department of the Municipal Education Bureau, reported on the social education work in Shanghai in the past year at the Municipal Government Memorial Week at 9:00 a.m. yesterday (2nd), stating that 170,000 illiterate people can be eliminated this year, and more than ten vocational supplementary schools will be added. He reported separately on the bureau's acceptance and reorganization work, mass school education, various social education facilities, and future development plans as follows:

Acceptance and Reorganization Work

After the restoration of Shanghai, the Wenlang Mass Education Center was slightly repaired and could be used. The museum, library, stadium, and botanical garden in the city center district were difficult to restore, either because the troops had not been withdrawn or because the cultural relics had been lost. In January of this year, two exhibition rooms were opened on North Sichuan Road to establish a museum. The swimming pool was opened during the summer vacation of this year. The stadium has also been restored.

Mass School Education

The Municipal Education Bureau regards eliminating illiteracy as the central work of social education. The population of Shanghai is 3.5 million, and there are at least more than one million illiterate people. A plan for universally promoting mass education was formulated, aiming to eliminate it within five years. The methods adopted are as follows: 108 mass schools were established, graduating once every four months, urging municipal private primary and secondary schools and social education institutions to concurrently run mass schools. A total of 1,000 classes have been opened, with 50,000 students, and 650 classes have graduated, with 30,000 students. In August, 800 mass education literacy classes were established, with 40,000 students. About 30,000 people are expected to graduate by the end of the term. In this year, 170,000 illiterate people can be eliminated. In addition, six municipal vocational supplementary schools and three general supplementary schools have been established. Recently, one school has been added to Yimiao, which has already enrolled students and started classes. One school in Hongkou is still in preparation. As for private supplementary schools, factories and companies are encouraged to establish them on their own. Twenty-three have been established. However, the general private supplementary schools in this city often enroll students without going through the filing procedures, and should be banned. As of the end of November, 44 schools have applied to the bureau for filing, 4 correspondence schools, 5 schools for the deaf and blind, and 3 mass schools. Staff are still being sent to investigate. Those with good results will be subsidized, and those that do not meet the requirements will be ordered to close.

Various Social Education Facilities

In addition to restoring the Wenlang Mass Education Center, two branch libraries have been established in Gaoqiao and Dachang, and the Yangjing branch library is being prepared for establishment. The regular work of each library includes reading newspapers and magazines, health activities, household affairs guidance, and popular lectures. In rural areas, agricultural demonstration and handicraft improvement are held. In addition to the main library on Fuzhou Road, the library has one branch library and twelve circulation stations. The museum is on North Sichuan Road. The science museum is located at 601 Jiaozhou Road, with physics and chemistry departments for the use of public and private middle school students. The gymnasium is on Shaanxi Road, with a fitness room for free activities for the public. The stadium has also been renovated recently. The educational experimental areas are one in Tangqiao, Pudong, and one in Zhenru, West Shanghai. The experimental mass schools have children's, women's, adult, and supplementary classes, with attached nurseries, clinics, and household affairs rooms. The electrified education team has two 16mm projectors, and regularly travels to various schools in rural areas to screen educational films.

Future Development Plan

Next year's plan will actively continue to carry out the work of eliminating illiteracy and relieving out-of-school people, and plans to add 190 municipal primary schools, 40 vocational supplementary schools, 17 general supplementary schools, and 2,000 mass education literacy classes, and it is estimated that 300,000 illiterate people will be eliminated.

Youyou is now a different team and is in very good condition. It tied Qingbai 1-1. After narrowly winning Youyou in the first game, Hequn has been defeated in every game since then. Youyou should be able to take revenge this week.

In the first round between Donghua and Longjie, the former defeated the latter 2-1.

### Black and White Team of Twenty-Eight Left Shanghai for Xiamen Yesterday by Air

The Philippine overseas Chinese Black and White Men's and Women's Basketball Team came to Shanghai last month to learn from various strong teams. However, due to the cold weather, many players were not used to it, resulting in injuries. Therefore, the team's performance in Shanghai was affected and did not reach its full potential. Now that the schedule has been completed, they are returning south in batches. Yesterday (2nd), due to ticket reasons, the first batch of 20 people, led by Secretary Huang Rongjie, took a China Airlines flight to Xiamen. According to a telegram from the local area, they have arrived safely at their destination and have begun to contact the opposing team and will hold charity games to raise funds to benefit the disaster victims. However, Xiao Huatuo, a member of the team staying in Shanghai, has not yet recovered from his arm injury and urgently needs to rest. Cai Jindian and Wu Yuwu of the women's team both need to take a boat from Shanghai to the Philippines early due to holiday reasons. Therefore, the rumor that Xiao and Cai are "joining Qingbai to play in Hong Kong" is not true. The remaining team members in Shanghai are also scheduled to take a flight to Xiamen on Friday (6th) this week, accompanied by team leader Cai Lianfa, to join forces. After the competition, they will return to the Philippines.

### Standards for Fines in Household Registration Increased; Handling in Accordance with New Regulations Promulgated by the National Government

The municipal government, regarding the "Regulations for Increasing the Standards of Fines," has already been promulgated and implemented by the National Government. According to Article 3 of these regulations: "Fines to be imposed according to law shall be increased up to three hundred times the original amount." Whether household registration fines can be imposed by analogy to these regulations, or whether they still need to be handled in accordance with the "Wartime Regulations for Increasing the Standards of Fines," was clarified by telegram from the Ministry of Interior, which stated: "The 'Regulations for Increasing the Standards of Fines' were promulgated and implemented by the National Government on October 14, 1946. According to the principle that later laws take precedence over earlier laws, the 'Wartime Regulations for Increasing the Standards of Fines' are no longer applicable after the promulgation of these regulations. Chapter 7 of the current Household Registration Law, concerning penalties, does not contain the provisions referred to in the provisos of Articles 1 and 3 of the former regulations. Therefore, household registration fines can each be increased up to one hundred times according to the provisions of the first sections of Articles 1, 3, and 2 of the same regulations. This is in addition to notifying various provincial and municipal governments to comply and instructing subordinates to take note."

Changes to Baojia Heads in Various Districts

Ong Ziyu, head of the third bao of the twenty-third district (Wusong), resigned. The vacancy was filled by Wang Baoli, the deputy bao head, as approved by the municipal government, which also instructed that a qualified person be promptly re-elected to fill the vacancy of the deputy bao head and reported for appointment. Wang Jisheng was selected by the jia heads' meeting of the thirty-fourth bao of the third district (Yimiao) to fill the vacancy of deputy bao head. Furthermore, Cai Guoliang was selected as bao head and Zhang Yuankun as deputy bao head by the jia heads of the twentieth bao of the twelfth district (Jiangning), and they have been respectively appointed by the municipal government.

The thirteenth bao of the fourth district (Penglai), due to the addition of straw huts in the twenty-sixth jia, plans to add a jia and has selected Xu Juru as jia head. The ninth bao of the twenty-third district (Wusong), due to the increase in boat households, has added a jia and appointed Bai Rufu as jia head. Both of these have been approved by the municipal government for record.

### Brief News from Various Districts

The tenth district office, upon order, is handling the registration and investigation of property losses suffered by the people of this city during the Anti-Japanese War. In recent days, people going to the district office to register have been extremely enthusiastic.

The bao clerks of the tenth district have completed the household registration transcription. They are now concentrated in the district office, copying and compiling statistical slips.

The mediation committee of the sixteenth district (Hongkou) has elected Zhou Chengen, Xu Tingdong, Zhang Huansheng, Guo Wenqi, Ye Shiguan, Zhu Shenfu, Zhao Mengjing, Dai Xixiong, and Zhu Weiru as members during the first district people's representative assembly.

### Building Nanchang as a Model City

— Fourth Dispatch from Liu Zao, our Nanchang Reporter

The war destroyed Nanchang, but a new Nanchang is being rebuilt after the war. To rebuild Nanchang, the central government has designated it as a model city. Urban planning expert Mr. Fitch from the Executive Yuan, Section Chief Shen Erming from the Ministry of Interior, and Director Ha Xiongwen from the Construction Department of the Ministry of Interior have successively come to Nanchang to conduct on-site inspections. Mayor Ying Xin convened a forum with people from all walks of life while Director Ha and others were surveying the province. There was a detailed discussion on how to construct Nanchang as a model city. Regarding the overall construction plan, Mr. Fitch advocated adding a residential area to the original first and second industrial zones, and also adding an industrial zone to the residential area south of the city to reach a compromise. The original plan for the sewer system was for it to flow from the East and West Lakes into Qinglan Lake, and then into the Gan River. However, Mr. Fitch suggested that it flow from the north of the city into the Gan River, and that the area around Qinglan Lake be designated as a scenic area. The old airfield would be designated as an administrative area, and the existing Jieshi Park would be expanded into a Central Park. The areas around the East and West Lakes would all be designated as parks.

How to build a new Nanchang? This article will introduce the construction plan as a reference for those concerned about municipal construction.

Current Status of the City; Original Construction Plan

Post-war Nanchang is a crippled city. Of the original 45,214 tall shops and residences, 35,205 were destroyed by the fires of war. The total loss accounts for 75% of the original buildings. The war destroyed Nanchang, so a new Nanchang should be built after the war.

Nanchang's existing urban area is on the east bank of the Gan River. The reconstruction of the streets has already formed a model of excellent new urban construction. There are four lakes in the center of the urban area. The city center is around the shores of the lakes and the banks of the Gan River, so Nanchang's urban area is a basin.

The city's external transportation includes countless sailboats and steamers on the Gan River by waterway, and the Nanxun, Zhegan, and Ganxiang railways and several highways by land. The Nanxun railway and highway extending northward start from Niuhang on the west bank of the Gan River. The Zhegan and Xianggan roads extending eastward and westward start from the east bank of the Gan River. The traffic on the east and west banks is connected by the Zhongzheng Bridge, which connects the entire traffic artery of Jiangxi and completes a flexible transportation network.

Nanchang's municipal construction plan has long had a detailed plan. The formulation of this plan is based on the inevitable increase in Nanchang's population in the future, and the inevitable trend of industrial development. However, according to Mr. Fitch's survey, he believes that if the industry cannot be developed reasonably, the population will not increase rapidly and significantly. Although Nanchang is the administrative center and the location of the provincial capital, this cannot be a reason for a substantial increase in population. Regarding the zoning of businesses, Mr. Fitch advocated a slight correction to the original plan. According to the existing zoning plan, there are three industrial zones: the first zone is on the west bank of the Gan River, the second zone is on the peninsula in the Gan River north of the city, and the third zone is on the east bank of the Gan River, part of the urban area north of the city. There are also three residential zones, one commercial zone, one administrative zone, and one cultural zone. The improvement of water, highway, railway, and air transportation systems has not been taken into account in this original plan.

Design Principles; Reconstruction of the Urban Area

The construction plan for the new urban area is based on two principles: (1) the reconstruction of the destroyed urban area, and (2) the future development of the Nanchang metropolitan area. These two stages must be coordinated with each other. The design of an important group center without a clear understanding of the organization of the attached areas is impossible. The distribution, location, quantity, etc. of each area depend on the conditions of its commercial center.

Furthermore, in the case of Nanchang, it is impossible to have an accurate estimate of the future population. The design should be based on the principle of distribution, that is, dividing the entire metropolitan area into several mutually useful zones, with the existing urban area as the autonomous center. Each zone must have a branch office, a branch post office, a branch police station, and an elementary school. If possible, a middle school should also be established. In the center of the existing urban area, land should be reserved for the construction of a municipal university. This institution should not be located within any zone. Applying this distribution principle can start the construction of the existing Nanchang urban area center without the need to reserve a large open area as necessary for the construction of district offices and schools. If developed according to the concentric principle, this is an unavoidable fact, which not only incurs unnecessary land costs but also impairs the scenery. The urban area reconstruction plan should naturally start with the four lakes in the urban area, and incorporate the lake area into a park. The existing Jieshi Park should be expanded into a Central Park. However, the prerequisite is to find suitable land to exchange for the private property occupied by the park. The old airfield in the east of the city is no longer in use, and some people advocate using this site for exchange.

Wide roads should be built around the Central Park, surrounding the park, and suitable connections should be made with other traffic lines. The most important of these is the connection line along the road around the park to the north corner and the Zhongzheng Bridge across the Gan River.

Two rows of houses can be built along the road around the park and the Central Park. The beautiful and magnificent environment of these houses, which can overlook all the scenery in the park, can be imagined. The original ring road will be the future commercial area. There is a wide market in the center of the area. The section of the ring road along the Gan River has been extended to the north and south, and it is expected to become a riverside avenue in the future.

Because the distribution principle is adopted for the design, the intention to set up a cultural zone has been abandoned. However, within the scope of the old airfield, land should be reserved for the construction of a municipal university. The south of the university site within the airfield is the planned administrative area. According to the Chinese customs of official residences, which are usually facing south, the main road of the administrative area is planned to be built along the southern boundary of the airfield. A part of the official residences can be directly reached from this main road, and others can be reached through parallel paths and courtyards.

South of the administrative area, a central railway station is planned to be set up, and a bus station is set up nearby. The square in front of the railway station and bus station is connected by the main traffic road in the urban area. In order for the railway station to have a suitable marshalling yard, the track opening south should be moved eastward. After the track is moved, there will be the following two advantages: the future expansion of the urban area group will not be restricted or obstructed by the track. In this way, it will be more convenient to find a site for the bridge connecting the north and south railways in the future.

Special attention should be paid to the method of reconstruction of the urban area's sewer system. The lowest section of the urban area is the center of the city. Most of the city's drainage water must flow to the central urban area, and then be discharged into the river by a pumping station. The outlet should preferably be at the downstream end of the urban area. The detailed design should be carefully studied by sanitation engineering experts before implementation. Mr. Fitch suggested building an underground reservoir that can have a buffer capacity under normal conditions. The reservoir has an overflow outlet. In the event of heavy rain, the increased volume of water can be discharged into the lake through the overflow, so that the drainage water, which is diluted to a considerable extent, will not pollute the lake water.

The current location of the water and electricity plant cannot meet the needs of the people with the future increase in population. Because there is no open land near the plant for future expansion, a large-scale model water and electricity plant should be rebuilt in a selected location in the planned industrial zone, and attention should be paid to the water intake and supply of the power plant.

The focus of Nanchang's future development is the designation and construction of industrial and residential zones. The currently selected industrial zone is planned to be located in the north of the urban area. In addition, a secondary industrial zone will be set up near the road to the south to engage in the construction of light industry. The first and second industrial zones are located on the east and west banks of the Gan River, respectively, which is extremely convenient for water transportation.

The first industrial zone is located on the west bank of the Gan River. The terrain is very high, and there are shallows on the bank that are completely exposed when the water level is low. However, the area is quite far from the main stream. The remedy is to build a dredged shallow river and build a canal port extending into the area to facilitate water transportation. The maintenance of this canal requires frequent dredging. If the design is excellent, the cost will not be huge.

To the west of the first industrial zone, it is planned to set up a railway line, station, and depot, so as to obtain contact with various industries.

The second industrial zone is located on the east bank of the Gan River. In contrast to the first zone, the terrain of the area is extremely low. When the water level is high, it falls below the horizontal line, and a levee should be used for protection. Therefore, the area also needs to build a river channel extending into the river channel through the embankment. Because the terrain is too low, the river channel must have a sluice to adjust the water level, so as to prevent the water level from being submerged when the water level is high.

The size of the river port and factory is the same as that of the first zone, and everything is aimed at a medium scale, and appropriate development should be made in light of the actual situation. The location of the size of the river entering the river must also be determined after water conservancy experiments. In this area, preparations must be made to build the foundation of a larger-scale water and electricity plant in the future, so as to avoid the water and electricity being polluted by the waste water discharged by the factory.

The residential area will be attached to the industrial area in the future, so as to shorten the distance between the factory and the employees' residence. The disadvantage of the original zoning plan is that the distance is too far. According to Mr. Fitch's new plan, the first residential area should be in the west bank of the Gan River. Set up a zone for the employees of the West Bank Industrial Zone. The area is separated from the industrial zone and the Nanjiu and Nanwan highways by the aforementioned lawn. According to Mr. Fitch's opinion, this lawn is not used as a park, so it will not cause any loss, and the original value of the land can be maintained.

The second residential area is planned to be set up in the south of the second industrial zone for the residence of employees in the area.

The third residential area is planned to be set up in the north of the city, and is not connected to any industrial area. The original residential area in the north of the city will only be expanded. The area is suitable for residents with higher incomes.

The fourth residential area is planned to be set up on the northeast and east sides of the administrative area and the municipal university, and is bounded by the railway station to the south. The south side is the newly built railway station warehouse. This area is planned to be used by residents who originally lived in the new central park.

In the south of the city center and the fourth residential area, it is planned to set up two more residences, one of which can be used as the residence of the third industry in the east of the railway line.

Finally, the southeastern area of Nanchang is occupied by the new airfield. According to the decision of the Montreux Conference in 1946, there should be a considerable open space around the airfield, and no houses should be built, and no obstacles such as power lines should be erected. Therefore, the use of the land should be farmland.

Construction Plan; How to Implement in the Future

The implementation of this new construction plan must also be divided into two parts, one is the reconstruction of the destroyed area, and the other is the expansion of the collective urban area. The implementation of the second plan—the expansion of the urban area—is not difficult. Within the scope to be expanded, except for buildings related to agriculture, all others will not be built.

Regarding the construction of the three industrial zones, Mr. Fitch advocated building the second zone first—the east bank of the Gan River—building the river channel sluice extending into the embankment, as well as the southern side port. The reason for his suggestion is that the establishment of factories is determined by a suitable foundation. If it is allowed to develop on its own, the factory foundation selected by the factory may not be within the area. If it is planned to build an industrial zone, it can provide more convenience, and it will definitely become an industrial center after a considerable period of time. The correlation between industries and mutual solicitation is well known.

There are many difficulties in the implementation of the reconstruction plan in the destroyed area. It will not be successful unless decisive measures are taken. Mr. Fitch believes that the redistribution of land is the only effective method for reconstruction according to the plan, that is, the development of the land in the destroyed area. If the land cannot be redistributed, cooperation among all industries is necessary. Otherwise, it will not only cause endless negotiations, but as a result, nine-tenths of the plan will not be implemented. At most, only a compromise solution can be obtained. The implementation of this plan does not require the municipal government to allocate new land for compensation. If the old airfield is public, the compensation can be used. The old airfield is public property, and it is divided into suitable small pieces to compensate the owners of the land requisitioned by the Central Park, and the land in the park can also be divided into small pieces for the same purpose.

The second problem in the new construction is the construction of houses. A distinction should be made between permanent and temporary houses. The lifespan of temporary houses is far longer than the estimated warranty period. This is a recognized fact. The demolition of this building is extremely difficult, let alone in today's severe housing shortage. Mr. Fitch suggested that the construction of temporary houses be absolutely prohibited, on the foundation of the proposed permanent houses and on the foundation within the scope of the Central Park. The implementation of the park plan must not demolish houses that can still be used after the deadline. He believes that temporary houses are only allowed to be built on the foundation of the planned railway station field and the administrative area. When deciding to implement any conditions of this plan, the owners or residents will have no sufficient reason to oppose the demolition of the slower plan. The construction of permanent houses is of course based on the principle of not violating the new urban area construction plan, and the architectural design must be approved by the municipal authorities.

According to engineering calculations, Mr. Fitch estimated that the plan to build Nanchang as a model city will take 20 years to complete. However, with the current financial resources and manpower in Nanchang, it is not enough to bear the implementation of this great project. The municipal authorities are now determined to start with the greatest efforts from the near and small. Mayor Tang Xin hopes to use his own sweat and blood to promote its success. We also hope that the central government and people from all walks of life will assist and move towards the expected goal.

### A Trip to Hai'an

— Dispatch from Ling Songchou, our Taixian Reporter, Hai'an, November 15

Before Dongtai was recovered, the reporter took some time to visit Hai'an. Originally, the original destination of this trip to the east was Hai'an; later, because the war on the front line progressed rapidly, the reporter went straight to Anfeng without stopping in Hai'an.

When you arrive in Hai'an Town, the most noticeable thing is the earthen city wall on the periphery. It follows the undulations of the terrain and surrounds the entire Hai'an. At the foot of the city, trenches are dug, and outside the trenches, caltrops are spread all over the place. The atmosphere is quite solemn. The Great King Temple east of the city is said to be one of the best monasteries in northern Jiangsu. However, the power of the Buddha could not stop the power of the fire. During this siege by the Communist army, all the buildings in the temple were destroyed. The two stone lions outside the mountain gate stood opposite the setting sun, adding infinite emotion to people. According to the Buddhist scriptures: "All conditioned phenomena are like dreams, illusions, bubbles, and shadows." This should also be "liberation", right?

During the nineteen-day siege by the Communist army, Hai'an suffered immeasurable losses in terms of materials; and in terms of spirit, the people of Hai'an, all those who have experienced this storm, I think they should never forget it in their lives. The gun smoke and bullets lasted for nineteen days. The terror of the war gave the people of Hai'an too much! During the three days the reporter was in Hai'an, he could feel it almost anytime, anywhere.

Someone said to me:

"I saw with my own eyes a shell flying over, and with a crash, half of a roof was lifted off!"

Someone said to me:

"One evening, I went to the street for something, and suddenly, with a bang, a shell landed less than twenty steps in front of my right. Oh my God, it was really dangerous! If I had come out earlier that day, or ran faster, I might have been buried in the dirt long ago!"

Someone else said to me:

"Hey! At that time, we just passed out in a daze. In fact, it's hard to say who was a human and who was a ghost at that time. Because there were too many opportunities to die! Today, we are really 'people'!"

Terror is terror, but it's just a memory. The reality in front of us is that under the protection of the National Army, the front line is getting farther and farther away every day; and the market in Hai'an is becoming more and more prosperous every day.

There are many vendors on the street, selling Flag oranges and glass belts, almost all American goods. The business is very good, and it feels much more active than the business in ordinary shops! In the markets of general recovered areas, many develop in such a distorted way!

Many red and green war reports are scattered on both sides of the street, such as "The National Army recovered Fuan at × o'clock this morning" or "Our army entered Tuofeng at × o'clock this morning" and so on. From this one thing, it reflects how excited and concerned the people are about the National Army's advance!

What creates a wartime flavor together with these war reports is the pillbox on the street. A pillbox is placed in the center of a bustling street, and at first glance, it seems that the road has been cut off. However, people who are used to running in northern Jiangsu know the inside story. Walk up to it, turn a corner, and you'll find "the willow trees are dark, the flowers are bright, and there is another village." There are also some pillboxes in Hai'an that are connected to the houses on both sides, with a door in the middle for pedestrians to enter and exit. The appearance and internal structure are simply a city gate. I never expected that the war barrier of the 16th century would still be useful today.

In recent decades, Hai'an has produced two calligraphers. One is Han Guojun, and the other is Tan Zuyun. Han Guojun's style name was Zishi. He once served as the governor of Jiangsu Province and made many contributions to the Yongli in northern Jiangsu. His calligraphy followed the style of the Northern Wei stele, which was vigorous and spectacular. It is said that he died in depression during the enemy puppet occupation. This spring, the newspaper reported that the National Government issued an order to commend him and held a public memorial service to honor his loyalty. Tan Zuyun's style name was Dezhong. He was also known as the Old Man of Hailing. He was the father-in-law of Han, and his calligraphy followed the Northern Wei style. He wrote the Book of Calligraphy very skillfully, and was as famous as President Tan Yanxi in Changsha. For a time, he was known as the Two Tans of the North and South. It is now heard that he is still alive and well. Because of these two calligraphers, the style of calligraphy is particularly strong in Hai'an. The Spring Festival couplets in general stores imitate the styles of the two of them, either Han's vigorousness or Tan's elegance. Of course, whether they look alike or not is another question. However, in a small way, it is enough to see that the spread of literary style, even if it is one or two people, is enough to change the atmosphere, without waiting for publicity and promotion to take effect.

Han is very admired in Hai'an. People call him Han Er Taiye (Second Master Han). Now his daughter, Ms. Liu Xian, is the chairman of the town chamber of commerce. With Han's literary talent, he can naturally benefit future generations. Han's residence is in Dongmen, which is quite elegant. The headquarters of the 65th Division stationed in the town is located inside. The reporter went in for a while to visit the commander of the division, General Li Zhen.

The reporter suspected that the room General Li was living in was Han's bedroom, because there was a portrait of Han on the wall.

The house is Chinese-style, and the room is full of banners presented to the division commander by various organizations and the national body. They are inscribed with "Southeast Barrier" and "Shield of the Nation." There is a small garden next to the house, with some pavilions and the like in the garden.

When the reporter went, the commander was reviewing documents. After a while, he got up to greet him. We then began a five-minute conversation.

The commander is from eastern Guangdong and is about 50 years old. He doesn't speak all Cantonese, so it's still understandable.

The reporter first asked the commander about the experience of being heavily besieged by the Communist army for nineteen days.

The commander said:

"The details are not clear for the time being. In short, the Communist army used more than 20 regiments of troops, while we only had one brigade, and external aid was completely cut off; fortunately, the people worked together to give us a lot of help."

Then the commander told the reporter a little about the brief history of the 65th Division:

"This division was established in Guangdong. Most of the soldiers are from Guangdong and Guangxi, and there are very few northerners. At first, they were responsible for defense along the coast, and then they fought in the Hunan and Jiangxi areas. This spring and summer, they were transferred from Zhejiang to Suzhou, and then from Jingjiang to northern Jiangsu."

The reporter also asked about the situation in northern Jiangsu, and asked him to express some opinions. He said very politely:

"We are purely an executive unit. Everything depends on the instructions of our superiors. There is no way to talk about opinions."

At this time, the reporter asked the commander to allow him to take a photo, and he agreed, but he said with a smile:

"It's best not to publish it in the newspaper, because the task of soldiers is to work! We don't pay attention to appearances." The commander is a typical Chinese soldier, speaking so calmly, and smiling so calmly!

The portrait of Han Guojun on the wall was smiling, as if congratulating his hometown for having such a general sitting here.

### Idle Talk About the Guilin Market

— Airmail Report from November 18th, Our Guilin Correspondent Liang Xiaozhong

From outside the gate, looking at a household in constant turmoil, one always feels a bit of mystery and interest. Similarly, standing at an unfamiliar angle, sketching an outline of Guilin's "abacus family" also feels unfathomable.

Guilin has been a county since the Qin Dynasty. Throughout the vicissitudes of thousands of years, it has always been a capital city with a strong political atmosphere. The rise of merchants was, at most, a matter within a small circle, unable to have much impact. However, business is always business. Today, the common people know how to make money, and officials also admire the lofty spirit of Tao Zhu, making grand gestures. Before long, one can't help but feel a sense of "exactions from both above and below."

One of the Four Major Cities - A Different World Within

Those who compete for profit are in the market, and those who compete for fame also come to the market. Thinking of Yue Wu Mu's saying, "Civil officials do not love money," from the pursuit of profit, and then thinking of the massive bureaucratic capital groups in Guangxi today, such as certain trading companies, transportation firms, foreign goods stores, and hotels, one can't help but respect merchants. That being said, the principle of "market prosperity and commerce" is inseparable from this city. Today, Guilin is gradually returning to a superficial prosperity. Who can fail to appreciate the contributions of merchants and those who are both officials and merchants!

Guilin is one of the four major cities in Guangxi. Its trade and commerce are far less prosperous than Wuzhou, Liuzhou, and Nanning, and even less so than Guixian (a small city that suddenly rose to prominence due to its strategic transportation location). However, it borders Hunan to the north and relies on the Li River, with convenient highways to the north and south. The arteries connecting Hunan, Guangxi, and Guizhou are expected to open up, and air transport to Beijing and Shanghai provides same-day delivery. Therefore, it may not be without a different world within. Although the market is bleak compared to the bustling commerce of two years ago, it is still not comparable. However, its vitality is like spring grass after a fire. Given an opportunity, it is always the world of the bosses. Guilin itself has no special products; it is merely a hub for transshipment. Among the goods active in the market, there are not many visible ones. What there are should include "American equipment" in department stores and tung oil and sugar that come and go in a hurry.

Two Major Livelihoods for Brokers - Tung Oil and Sugar

The two major livelihoods for brokers are tung oil and sugar. The former's players keep their eyes on Guangzhou and Hong Kong, while the latter's customers listen to Hunan and Hankou. Goods are shipped out from Guilin in different directions, and then money flows back from both routes. Many people have made a fortune this way. The source of tung oil mostly comes from Hunan (even though Guangxi has been advocating planting tung trees for more than ten years, it still shouts for planting trees every year, but no trees are seen). With good luck, a single transaction can yield a profit of two or three percent. The trend has been good lately, with prices increasing tenfold. In one week, the price rose by 20,000 yuan (from 90,000 to 110,000), and it still looks strong. Oil brokers are smiling from ear to ear. Sugar is mainly produced in the Dahe area and is transported via automobile or up the Li River to Guilin, where it is transshipped to Hengyang and distributed to the Yuehan northern section area. The market is constantly advancing. Hunan customers have a strong appetite, taking in every batch. Top-quality refined sugar has hit the 170,000 mark. Slab sugar has also exceeded 80,000. These two items are the most precious in the entire market. In addition, Hunan paper is transported south, also seeing profitable routes. However, Jiangxi paper floods the market, resulting in poor sales. Many players are also involved in gasoline and kerosene, but unfortunately, the good times do not last long. Prices rise and fall too quickly. White gasoline plunged 20,000 yuan and is currently hovering around 160,000. As for other miscellaneous goods transactions, the scale is small and not worth mentioning.

Firewood, Rice, Oil, Salt, and Other Items - Constant Ups and Downs

Speaking of the seven necessities of life, firewood, rice, oil, and salt, the past six months have been a turbulent period that has shaken people's hearts. Among them, the rice market has been the most frightening. Guilin is only known for its chili peppers and is otherwise devoid of resources. Its rice supply mostly relies on counties in northern Guilin and Hunan rice coming south. Last year's unprecedented disasters led to no harvest in Hunan and northern Guilin, causing immense panic in Guilin. Rice merchants shouted for prices of 10,000 yuan per dan. It was not until this harvest that prices gradually declined, falling below 20,000. As long as the supply is even slightly disrupted, prices are immediately bid up. Those who manipulate and hoard include both merchants and officials, which is another lamentable situation. Currently, due to the lack of rain in May and the threat of early pests in the next crop, a famine-like situation is developing again, and prices have already returned to around 30,000, with a tendency to rise further. People are fearful and live in constant anxiety. As for firewood and cooking oil, they are also as precious as Guilin jade liquor. Cooking oil costs 115,000 per dan, and firewood costs 4,000 yuan for two bundles. The salt market is sluggish, with few people inquiring. Snow salt can be traded for 30,000.

Relying on Shanghai's Guidance - Foreign Goods are Popular

With goods in this state, what is the market like? Guilin's stores, relying on the Shanghai breeze, are now without "America" nothing is complete, with "America" everything is perfect. Anything labeled "USA," even if it's sweet potatoes or turnips, is probably not worried about being unsold. A glass raincoat costs 70,000 yuan, and people scramble for it. A glass handbag costs 45,000, and people scramble for it. Even the Women's friend (menstrual belt) from America is extremely profitable. Foreign goods are popular, and cloth and yarn are also spirited. American mercerized cotton yarn costs 7,000 yuan per foot, not to mention that Hunan white homespun is also selling firmly. Hunan yarn is priced at 35,000. Large quantities of cloth and yarn flood in from Shanghai and Guangzhou, yet demand still exceeds supply. 20-count Nanma yarn is near a peak of 3 million. At its most popular, indigo cloth was traded for 160,000. The cloth and yarn market is bustling. On the surface, it seems that people's purchasing power is extremely strong, but in the end, it's just that people are replacing their worn-out clothes from the past three or four years. Once the peak season passes, it will probably be desolate and bleak.

The gold market, which causes waves and mischief, rose from 80,000 to 270,000 after the foreign exchange adjustment. Since then, it has remained dormant and sluggish. Guilin has nearly 30 gold shops, and most of the power is in the hands of "Jiangxi old timers." Whether things go well or poorly, it's all up to them. Currently, the shops are deserted. Daily transactions total only ten or eight taels. Bosses lie on the counter, napping the days away. However, one qian of ornamental gold can still earn 3,000 yuan.

30 to 50 Million Yuan Worth of Goods - Suffering from Indigestion

Overall, Guilin's market is lively in its desolation, and desolate in its liveliness. Apart from the official world, no one seems to have found a good way to make a fortune. 30 to 50 million yuan worth of goods are suffering from indigestion. Occasionally, when goods are sold off at a discount, the profit, after deducting taxes and commissions, is somewhat moist. When encountering a bad month, shops have to close immediately. Few merchants here receive benefits from banks, unless they have sufficient connections and a solid foundation, which is another matter. The past month has been the peak season. Merchants come and go in a hurry, buying and selling. Stores offer preferential treatment to customers, drumming up business, which does add some liveliness. However, after 10 PM, all the houses are already closed, and the streets are deserted, leaving only dim lamps, quietly illuminating the desolate roads and the disaster victims wandering the streets. Who says merchants can truly lead Guilin out of the sorrow of severe winter?

### The Misfortune of Ning Tea

— Nanchang Report on the 19th, Our Correspondent Liu Zao

Wu Ning, located in the northwestern corner of Jiangxi, has a mountainous terrain and lacks rice paddies. It is a large tea garden in Jiangxi, and the primary economic source for the people in the mountainous area. Before the war, the highest annual production of black tea was 10,000 chests, which were transported to Shanghai and resold to tea firms in England, America, Germany, and the Soviet Union.

The products of the Wu Ning tea area are collectively known as "Ning Tea" in Shanghai. Over the past eight years, it has suffered miserably from enemy devastation. Tea trees were cut down and used as firewood, leaving behind a desolate scene. Tea farmers were also hampered by obstructed tea sales due to difficulties of living. They had no choice but to leave large plots of land barren and change occupations. This year's output has plummeted, less than one-tenth of pre-war levels. There are currently 850 chests of new tea being transported to Shanghai. Until today, they are still stored in warehouses, and no one is interested. If this year's tea sales suffer another blow, the future of Ning Tea will inevitably collapse.

Those familiar with the tea industry generally say that the lives of tea farmers are even more difficult than those of rice farmers in the plains. They suffer from economic pressure and exploitation by tea merchants. Their year-round hard work barely provides enough to eat. Currently, the purchase price of the Wu Ning Tea Cooperative is 300 yuan per catty for black tea and 400 yuan per catty for green tea. After the Tea Cooperative purchases the tea, processing and manufacturing costs add up to nearly 2,000 yuan per catty. Based on the current tea market situation in Shanghai, the cost of one dan of black tea is 200,000 yuan, and the highest selling price can only reach 250,000 yuan. The 850,000 chests of Ning Tea stored in Shanghai have not attracted any interest so far due to excessive costs and low market prices. However, Ning Tea's misfortune is due to high costs on one hand and the dumping of Wenzhou tea and Taiwan tea on the other.

Women and Family

### Between Husband and Wife

— Du Yun

In our country's old etiquette, the union of husband and wife was often due to the orders of parents and the words of matchmakers. Although there were inevitably so-called mismatched couples, there were also many who could work together harmoniously and grow old together. Nowadays, the union of husband and wife is often due to free love. Among them, many can maintain happiness, but it seems to have become commonplace for them to easily turn against each other and separate. From this perspective, the way husband and wife get along is truly not easy. The former can maintain their relationship for a long time, to some extent, due to moral concepts; the latter's quick separation and reunion is really due to selfishness. The relationship between husband and wife is the foundation of human relations and should be treated with respect. To maintain the affection between husband and wife, the following points should be noted:

1.  Consideration means mutual consideration. The wife should be considerate of the husband, knowing that the husband works outside, whether mentally or physically, it is still labor. After finishing work and returning home, he is naturally exhausted. The wife should give him a chance to rest and restore his tired spirit, so that the family becomes the husband's paradise. It is absolutely unacceptable for the wife to seem to increase her burden as soon as the husband enters the door, being impatient to serve him, or nagging and complaining about trivial matters. This makes the husband see the family as hell, and his love for his wife gradually cools down. The husband should also be considerate of the wife, knowing that women are weaker than men. If there are things that can reduce the wife's burden in housework, he should try his best to make them happen. So-called meticulous consideration can naturally maintain happiness. Furthermore, understanding means mutual understanding. There is no such thing as arguing over face between husband and wife. They should understand each other. The husband should explain to the wife when disagreements arise due to her lack of knowledge or physical strength. He should help her operate within his ability to give her a rest. This makes him a good husband in the wife's mind. The wife should be considerate of the husband's external social life and interactions with friends, knowing how to consider the husband's position, especially regarding household expenses, spending according to income, and not making all sorts of unreasonable demands on the husband. In this way, they can get along for a long time.

2.  Loyalty - Some husbands think that their wives are ignorant women and do not let their wives know anything about what is happening outside. They even keep the amount of their salary secret, which is disloyal to their wives. As a result, the wife does not know how much the husband earns and cannot estimate expenses. This alone leads to suspicion in other areas. A gap forms between the wife and the husband. The longer the gap lasts, the colder the love becomes, and the result is naturally painful. If the wife does not tell the husband the truth and acts suspiciously, it will naturally cause the husband to be unhappy. In short, a person should act with integrity, especially between husband and wife. If they get along in this way for a long time, seeing each other's character, their love will become deeper and more affectionate, and they can look forward to growing old together.

### Marriage Quotes

What is terrible is: neither being able to live with a woman, nor being able to live without a woman. - Byron

I have made a lifelong bond with her (or him); I have chosen. From now on, my goal is no longer to seek someone who makes me happy, but to make the person I have chosen happy. - Maurois

The problem of mankind lies in reconciling mystery and science, and marriage is the same. - Alain

Without the cooperation of the two sexes, there will be no true civilization. But without mutual acceptance of differences and mutual respect for different natures between the two sexes, there will be no true cooperation between the two sexes. - Maurois

### Nutritious Food

— Yun Hui

The north wind rises again, and the climate gradually turns cold. This is the most suitable time for tonics. Therefore, all kinds of tonics rise with the wind, especially in the current market full of American goods, vitamin pills, liver extract, Paleto, and various tonic injections, etc., in various ways. Although some of them have considerable effects, there are also many that are over-hyped.

There is a saying in our country: "Medicinal tonics are not as good as food tonics," which is very reasonable. The West also has the saying "Buy tonics, you can go to the vegetable market to find them." In the past, there was no specific medicine for pernicious anemia. Later, a doctor accidentally discovered that fresh liver could cure patients with this disease. After much research, the main components of the liver were extracted and made into liver extract for oral administration or injection. Nowadays, general pharmaceutical factories purchase beef and pork livers from vegetable markets. Therefore, the liver, which was originally a food for the common people, immediately became an aristocratic tonic.

From this, it can be seen that for all nutritional diseases, the required nutrients can be obtained from certain foods to nourish the body. Medicines are only in an auxiliary position. Therefore, if we want to take tonics, we should eat more nutritious foods at every meal.

The following table lists several nutritious foods for housewives' reference.

Common Knowledge

### The Quality of Soap

— Nei Jin

Soap can be said to be one of the most indispensable household daily necessities; however, due to the poor quality of soap, general households often suffer great losses invisibly, paying high prices but getting no good results, so this is worth paying attention to. Now, I will write down the simplest and most effective method of identifying the quality of soap for everyone to test.

First, dissolve a small piece of soap in pure alcohol, or heat it to dissolve it. In this way, impurities such as sand, starch, and small stones contained in the soap will not dissolve and will completely settle at the bottom; if it is a good pure soap, it must be able to dissolve completely without any precipitation.

Second, ordinary soaps all contain unsaponified fat, which is not very suitable, because it is not easy to make the washed items clean. The freshly cut surface of the soap can be applied to a sheet of transparent cellophane, slightly heated, and if transparent small spots are seen under sunlight, it is unsaponified fat.

Third, inferior soaps all contain free alkali, which not only does not make the washed items clean, but also easily makes the skin of the washer's hands feel dry and painful. Take a small amount of soap, dissolve it (add alcohol or heat), and then drip a few drops of liquid mercuric chloride (i.e., HgC12). If a yellowish-brown precipitate occurs, it proves that it contains alkali. It can also be placed in dry (or ventilated) air, and if white needle-like crystals occur, it is because there is too much free alkali.

Fourth, soap containing too much fat is also not good. Place a small piece of soap in dilute sulfuric acid (3 c.c.), heat it, and wait for it to cool. If too much fat is seen to condense on the top, it is also not suitable to use as it is too wasteful when washing.

### A Child's Heart

— Han Ying

After reading Miss Feng's "Stepmother's Heart" in this column on November 19, I couldn't help but be touched by my own life experience.

My mother passed away when I was just four years old. After more than a year, I had a "new mom." Because I heard people say that "new moms" hit people, I didn't dare to approach her, but out of curiosity, I quietly leaned against the head of the bed and watched her comb her hair from afar. The new mom ignored me. After tidying up her hair, she went out of the room. This was the scene on the second day after the stepmother entered the house. At that time, the impression of this "new mom" was: maybe she won't hit me, but I also don't feel that she loves me. Later, I often heard her arguing with my father, so I felt that the new mom was scary.

I remember it was during the New Year when my four siblings and I went to my uncle's house. Because I had my cousins as companions, my uncle liked to tease us, and my aunt took care of our food and clothing at all times. We really felt happy. After playing for a few days, someone from home came to pick us up. What did the children know? We wanted to play happily wherever it was fun, so we hurriedly hid and encouraged my aunt to send the person back. After picking us up two or three times, we sadly went home. The strange thing was: after going back, Mom not only didn't ask us how we played at my uncle's house, whether it was fun or not, etc. When we went to greet her, she immediately darkened her face and turned away. It was like this for several days in a row, and we were also baffled. After being reminded by people at home: Mom is angry. What can we do to make Mom happy? It is said that we have to apologize to her (that is, apologize, she instructed the old maid who took care of me, telling us to do this). As a result, we were taken to her and kowtowed to her before she recovered. Since then, whenever the etiquette was not perfect, she would use this set of silent education, until we kowtowed and admitted our mistakes. Later, we liked to go to my aunt's house even more. Once we went, we never wanted to come back. Every time we had to go home, my aunt would coax and persuade us. I even blamed my aunt for asking us to go back when we were having fun. At that time, seeing my cousin acting spoiled in front of my aunt, I was amazed at his boldness and hoped that I also had a mom who would allow me to act spoiled, but once I got home, I had no courage at all. As for my father, I felt that he loved us, but apart from buying books and toys for me, he was always taciturn and solemn. Even if I had any opinions, I didn't dare to express them to him. Moreover, he was away from home for two years out of every three years. Apart from looking at my stepmother's face, all my activities were with the old servant. My stepmother sometimes also had a good face, that is, when guests came, especially in front of our uncle and aunt: "Uncle and Aunt, I have always been afraid of people saying that I can't treat the children of the former wife well. I have never hit these children, not even once. You ask them, see if I have ever hit them?" Indeed, she had never hit us, but we felt it was even more terrible than being hit. We grew up conscientiously under this kind of education. Naturally, the treatment of us and her young younger brother was completely different, and I don't need to say more.

I have always thought: "A stepmother's heart is like a three-inch nail, how long it is, how deep it is hammered." Whenever I heard that someone remarried, I secretly worried about his former wife and children. After reading this article, I felt that I was overthinking. I think this should be an educational problem. Women of our previous generation received very little education. Because there was a traditional old practice of stepmothers abusing the children of former wives, children inevitably feared stepmothers a little, but they still wanted to be close to "mother," just not daring to. In this state, an unreasonable stepmother would think that the children were not close to her. Just like going to uncle's house to play and not wanting to go home, that was also a natural thing. In the stepmother's heart, she would suspect that her aunt was instigating and alienating. In addition, because she had her own children, she couldn't help but favor her own flesh and blood, so she became more and more estranged from the children of the former wife, even truly opposed, creating several unfortunate events. As far as I can remember, I had no negative feelings about my stepmother in my childhood, and I really treated my stepmother as my own mother. As long as I pleased my mother, I would be willing to kowtow and apologize. My stepmother would be happy in her heart. When she was idle, she often teased me about whether she loved me or not. She said "I don't love you," and I would immediately cry. She said again "I love you," and I would immediately laugh through my tears. To her, she might be tricking this silly child to make her happy, but in my careful eyes, I thought it was really the case.

Seeing the child, Ming, written by Miss Feng, in that hesitant situation, reminded me of the scene when I saw my stepmother, exactly the same. It was that I wanted to be close to my new mom, but I was also afraid. If the stepmother understood this psychology of the child, she would immediately seize it, and I believe you would find him more lovely than your own biological child. Because he has a bit of inferiority complex, fearing that you won't love him, so he is most willing to accept your lessons.

I am already around thirty years old. Nowadays, more and more women are educated. Children of the next generation who have stepmothers may all be like Miss Feng's "Ming," which is truly a fortunate thing.

Spring and Autumn

### The Problem of Reproducing Works of Art

— Shi Chongpeng

The achievements of Chinese art predate those of any other country in the world. The stone carvings of the Wu Liang Shrine, the Yungang Grottoes, the Dunhuang murals, and the sculptures of the Sui and Tang dynasties, as well as the paintings of the Song and Yuan dynasties, are magnificent and exquisite, unparalleled in the world. However, for more than a thousand years, Chinese art has made no progress in technique. Not only has there been no progress, but even the ancient methods have disappeared, posing a danger of extinction and loss. As a result, the masterpieces of the past cannot be preserved, and the artistic works of the future cannot be produced. The Chinese nation, which has always been known for its art, is constantly regressing and will become a nation of low-ability people with no strengths.

There are, of course, many reasons for the decline of art and culture, but the government's failure to promote it and the people's lack of tools for studying art are the biggest problems. If any work of art is to progress, it must first study and understand the existing works of art, and then come up with new ideas and strive for excellence. For example, in painting, apart from the childhood years, when children should be allowed to freely express their innate creative ability, those who specialize in the study of art must imitate and refer to genuine works of famous paintings. (The techniques of learning Chinese painting and Western painting are fundamentally different.) They must study their brushwork and ink techniques, as well as their composition and structure, before they can change and create. Similarly, when learning sculpture, one must first refer to famous sculptures, study their carving techniques, and their postures and expressions, and then learn. It is not difficult to get started. Therefore, the existing famous works of art are good tools for learning art. In our poor country, with such a vast territory and such inconvenient transportation, even the most talented artists do not have the objective conditions to nurture and develop them, unless they grow up in aristocratic families (there is a Chinese saying, "If there are no ancient paintings in the hall, it is not an old family"). With a rich collection of calligraphy, paintings, and antiques, they can study them at any time. Otherwise, ordinary poor children who want to learn an art after their studies can only use woodcut mustard seed garden painting manuals and the like for imitation and reference. Beyond that, where can they see the achievements of past dynasties? Even the works of the Four Wangs and Wu Yun are not easy to see.

In the major cities of Europe and America, there are art galleries and museums, and there are also many art education institutions. Art lovers can freely visit and copy them. Anyone is encouraged to reproduce works of art. Moreover, thanks to the excellence of printing technology, all works of art are photographed, printed, and widely distributed, so that they can be disseminated and promoted even in remote rural areas. As a result, all art workers have access to a wealth of art reference materials. Looking around our country, in the past, the autocratic era was deeply hidden and closed. Since the Republic of China, although institutions such as the Palace Museum have been established, and in recent decades, there have also been copperplate and glass plate art prints, the results have been minimal, and there have been many restrictions. The reproduction of works of art is regarded as a patent. Not to mention the works of art in private collections, even the Palace Museum of the government has strict regulations regarding the works of art in the museum. Ten years ago, after participating in the Shanghai pre-exhibition of the London Chinese Art Exhibition, the author organized the observation notes of the painting section into a book, "Observation Notes on Famous Chinese Paintings," and submitted it to the Commercial Press for publication. A few painting illustrations were used, which aroused serious attention from the Palace Museum, with the suspicion of reprinting their secret book. Later, after the explanation by Teng Ruoqu, a counselor of the Executive Yuan, the matter was resolved. The Palace Museum holds such a view on the dissemination of works of art.

Recently, the Ta Kung Pao reported that 100 ancient paintings from the Palace Museum in Peiping were exhibited in Chengdu, and it was solemnly announced: "Photography and copying are prohibited during the exhibition." What is the reason for this? Why are the "photographing and copying" of ancient paintings collected by the state not allowed for the people of the country? Photography and copying are nothing more than promoting national treasures and studying art. Art museums in Europe and the United States are open to the public for copying. Why does our Palace Museum prohibit photography and copying? May I ask, if these ancient paintings from hundreds or even thousands of years ago are not openly copied and reproduced, then what scientific methods will the Palace Museum use to permanently preserve them hundreds or even thousands of years from now? How can it guarantee that they will not be naturally destroyed? At present, Chinese art is in a critical state of not advancing and retreating. It cannot be revived without the government's promotion and encouragement. Historically valuable works of art should be reproduced as much as possible, and art workers should be encouraged to copy them as much as possible. Then, these valuable works of art can be disseminated far and wide, throughout the country and the world, so that Chinese art will not be extinct or lost! I think those who are engaged in art and culture should have the same hope for the problem of reproducing works of art!

### Our Country's Art of Printmaking

— Wang Xingwu

After reading "Selected Woodcuts from Eight Years of Resistance Against Japan"

Although art is created by human beings, it cannot be separated from reality or transcend history. Art is accumulated from history and evolved from reality.

If art is something that transcends reality, then art is too mysterious and meaningless to life. Winkelmann said in a dream: "Art and nature are mixed together, and it is a purely objective fact." Hegel also said: "Art is the eternal rationality manifested in things, and its characteristics are 'infinity' and 'freedom'." It can be seen that the art of "truth, goodness, and beauty" is universal in the world and permeates the universe.

Art cannot be separated from nature or life. This has become an eternal theorem. However, if nature and life are not captured, synthesized, and developed through art, and summarized into a systematic literature, then the various forms of society and the various elements of natural beauty can never occupy space and be passed on in time, and have an impact on human beings.

Our country's art of printmaking has a considerable history. It can be said that it began in the Stone Age. Many of the relics left over from that time were carved with knives, and the tools and production methods were similar to those of modern woodcuts. Many stone fragments excavated from Zhoukoudian, Hebei, are very exquisitely carved, and the contents are all records of primitive life. Since the invention of printing, Chinese printmaking has achieved even more brilliant results. For example, ancient books, unofficial histories, Buddhist scriptures, Taoist canons, novels, and various kinds of publications all have illustrations. Folk customs are also depicted in various ways. Although there have been ups and downs and evolutions of prosperity and decline in these historical artistic achievements, we have never stagnated this precious undertaking at a standstill. The current rise of printmaking art is indeed influenced by foreign works, but our nation's artistic literature has its own excellent foundation.

Human society cannot exist without art, just as fish cannot exist without algae. The more advanced the art, the more civilized and progressive human life becomes. Therefore, the woodcut industry has emerged in the last few decades.

Fifteen years ago, the woodcuts in our country were still in the hands of "artisans." They carved decorations for dowries and carved points for doors, walls, and houses. Therefore, they could not enter the halls of elegance. Mr. Lu Xun saw this and opened up a new road for the woodcut world, erected the banner of the emerging woodcut movement, enriched the woodcut publishing industry, and expanded the woodcut business, so that the woodcut business produced an artistic effect, thus transforming the social view of woodcut art. "Selected Woodcuts from Eight Years of Resistance Against Japan" is selected from the thousands of works displayed in the exhibition of woodcuts from eight years of resistance against Japan. The complete collection contains 100 works, by 75 artists. They were carved with various knives and lines, with years of experience and cultivation. These artists have organized art groups all over the country to promote the woodcut movement, such as the Wood Bell Society, the 18 Art Society, the Chun Di Painting Society, the Yefeng Painting Society, the Shanghai Painting Research Society, the Chinese Printmaking Research Society, the Tianjin Woodcut Society, the Taiyuan Woodcut Research Society, the Modern Printmaking Society, the Kaifeng Woodcut Research Society, the Nanjing Woodcut Society, the Tao Kong Painting Society, the Iron Horse Printmaking Society, the Yewei Society, the Profound Woodcut Research Society, and the All-China Woodcut Association, etc. Not only that, they also continuously cultivate like old farmers, and constantly work hard to accumulate countless works that are passed down everywhere, whether in cities or villages. During the Anti-Japanese War, their works have been exhibited in Peiping, Tianjin, Taiyuan, Jinan, Shanghai, Hankou, Chongqing, Guilin, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Chaozhou, Guangzhou and other places, and they have all achieved excellent results. Even abroad, there are their masterpieces circulating. For example, the 1936 Hungarian World Woodcut Exhibition and the 1937 World Woodcut Exhibition held by the Art Institute of Chicago in the United States, they all sent works to participate. After 1939, they sent woodcuts to England, the United States, the Soviet Union, and India for exhibitions. The emerging Chinese woodcut art appeared in Moscow, Leningrad, London, New York, and Calcutta, and won praise from all over the world. As for their publications in the past ten years, the more historically valuable ones include dozens of types such as Modern Printmaking, Woodcut World, Woodcut Journey, Wood Art, Woodcut, and Art.

Art can make people's psychological functions full of harmonious activities. Although it is not practical, it can enlighten mankind to move upwards and progress. The emerging woodcut movement has this mission.

Thanks to the guidance of the pioneers, and the continuous efforts of countless woodcut artists in the past ten years, our country's woodcut business has inherited the past and opened up the future, and has embarked on the road of revival. "Selected Woodcuts from Eight Years of Resistance Against Japan" is the crystallization of their years of hard struggle. Like warriors, they carry a woodcut weapon, from rural areas to cities, from war zones to rear areas, from home to abroad, shouldering the mission of woodcut revival. Thanks to their efforts, the motherland has greater glory in art.

### Poetic Words

— Tian Su

Poetry is the most concise language in the world, using only a few words to express meanings that are ten or a hundred times more complex than the words themselves, and it must be expressed clearly, which is by no means an easy task. Therefore, the creation of poetry is by no means accidental, but it is transmitted to the poet's pen by accidental inspiration.

### The Helmsman Plus One Chapter

— Yang Mou

The Helmsman

Don't overestimate those huge battleships, whose master is only the full spirit of the helmsman; you also despise those small boats in the quiet rivers, they also have a helmsman working diligently.

Storms, huge waves, darkness, loneliness, break through it, smash it, …

Great helmsman. -- His life is entrusted with the lives of thousands of people, and his spirit is being tormented for thousands of people. His ultimate goal is upright, but he has to open up a winding road in those sea reef obstacles. The expression on his face may be serious, or it may be subtle and relaxed, but his heart is searching for a road without road signs.

Is this an ordinary job? Yes, when the ship cuts through the smooth water waves and moves forward leisurely, who can appreciate the hidden water power and reefs? The wind is blowing, the waves are rising, and the ship is tossing, which brings curses and ridicule. Who thinks that the helmsman is fighting for his life?

People only think about "themselves." Apart from "themselves," who is willing to think more?

Therefore, the helmsman's good intentions are always lonely.

Loneliness

Sometimes, I often feel lonely.

The whole world and laughter seem to have left me, only my own heart is beating the door of memory.

What pours out is sour, sweet, spicy, …

I am afraid of loneliness, and I am afraid of memories.

In the crowd, I have never discouraged myself, I have never shown weakness, and I have never been afraid. I will clench my teeth and learn from suffering. But, when emptiness often presses on me, I think, all the hard work is in vain, the world is only a garden for a few people, who can be indifferent?

Life is still so young, who wants to endure the suffering of loneliness? I like harmony, and I want to sing loudly with joy. The environment is like this, but I can't help but let loneliness slip into a corner of my life.

How to drive it away? But it always makes me wander.

### Anecdotes from the Literary World

— Zhan Weng

Zhang Taiyan

Mr. Zhang Taiyan once chanted red beans: "The south wind is difficult to compete with the north wind, and I look forward to Wuyang every day; I always miss each other across the fields, and send you a purple sachet from afar." Those who saw it did not know its intention. Taiyan said to others, "Why are red beans a symbol of love? I don't know where it comes from. Wang Wei only said that this thing is the most missed thing, so he must explain the reason for the love. My (Taiyan refers to himself) poem uses current affairs, not classical at all." At that time, Mr. Hu Zhentang was in Guangdong, and today's Chairman Chiang Kai-shek was in the capital, and sent someone to welcome him. There were many twists and turns in the exchange of letters. Taiyan specially borrowed red beans to compare the love between the two men.

In his later years, Taiyan lived in Wuzhong, and his seat was often full. Taiyan was talkative and willing to discuss politics with people, but in fact, he did not know much about human affairs. Politics was not his specialty. When Taiyan ate, he did not look around, and only used chopsticks on the nearest food in front of him. Once, he had dinner at a friend's house, and the dish in front of him was very spicy. Taiyan ate it endlessly, and his forehead was sweating. The servant saw this and quickly moved the dish away, and he was relieved. The host initially suspected that Taiyan was very fond of spicy food, but then he realized the reason. He retreated and told others, and it was passed on as a joke.

"Well, why didn't you point at this one-eyed dragon when he forced us into the car just now?" He Jian joked with Pingzi.

Pingzi received this telegram and quickly retracted her jade hand, glanced at He Jian, and pursed her standard small mouth again. He Jian smiled slightly and pulled back her plain hand and placed it in his palm.

"Don't joke anymore," Pingzi's fingers tapped the telegraph code again. "I haven't been here long, where did I get this skill?"

"What is the old man doing?" He Jian sent a telegram asking.

"Come to save us." Pingzi showed a smug smile; "I am very worried about your health, I calculated for you, there are more than fifty hours, without formal rest! Your spirit is still strong, but you can't consume it like this……!"

"Thank you for your concern……I also learned 'Xuan Arts', you can never sleep, just meditate for ten minutes every one or two hours."

"Really? ……Who did you learn it from?"

"It's absolutely true, don't you see I'm still very fresh now?……This was taught by my Chinese friend Yue Jun, he is a Chinese writer, and he is also a esoteric sect, attacking people with sword energy. A hollow push with his bare hands can knock down or even kill people a hundred meters away. His master is even more powerful, he can take people's heads from the air within a hundred miles, his grand master is even more powerful……" The telegram was interrupted; because the old man and the one-eyed gentleman had finished talking and walked over from across the street.

"Ping'er, get out of the car," the old man opened the car door and nodded to Pingzi, "Mr. He Jian has to go!"

Pingzi originally held He Jian's hand tightly and refused to let go, but seeing the old man, raised his hand in a wave, Pingzi seemed to have suffered a lot of strength, as if dragged, could not help but shudder, immediately let go of his hand, and got out of the car. At this time, the old man still held the car door, let Pingzi open, and raised a hand again, as if remotely stroking He Jian's forehead, gently pressed it:

"Haha, Namo Bolo Om Mi Hong……!" The old man released his old voice, chanting this.

He Jian sat in the corner of the car, after this press and chanting, his mind suddenly became confused, as if he was about to faint, but in the blink of an eye, he felt a heat suddenly filled his dantian. This heat, from below to above, from the fur to the outside, instantly spread throughout his body, it was as if he had completely rested all night, his spirit and physical strength suddenly became strong; and it seemed as if a potential was added out of thin air, and all the troubles, fears, anxieties of the past two days, turned into nothing, and suddenly felt that the future was bright.

(Science has finally entered the preliminary stage of enlightenment at the end of this twentieth century. There are still these superstitious, strange and chaotic gods and ghosts talking nonsense. I am afraid that the public will see this passage and say that this record has become a myth like the "Investiture of the Gods" and "Journey to the West". However, this technique is precisely a small function of the "applied psychology" in science; that kind of acting and chanting is just a means of transmitting the spirit; using one's own cultivated spirit to transmit it to the other party, and suddenly awaken the other party, and activate the other party's potential spirit; it is as if the exhausted battery has been recharged with new electricity. This is also like a tired and exhausted army, once it hears the report of the officers that the main force of reinforcements has arrived, and with relief supplies, it can generally increase its spirit and bravely charge into the battle. It is also like modern doctors, who can perform surgery without full or partial anesthesia, just need to hypnotize once, the patient will not feel pain, this hypnosis is a way of "applied psychology". Others, such as the knife swallowing and fire walking of the Indians and Yellow Religion, etc., look like magic, but they are actually a kind of self-hypnosis method, activating their own potential spirit and ability, which is not surprising.)

He Jian's spirits were lifted and his heart was very stable. Watching the old man take Pingzi away, he did not talk to the one-eyed gentleman in the car, nor did he ask him where he was going; he only knew that the car traveled for more than twenty-nine minutes, turned several streets, and then stopped abruptly. At this time, He Jian was only thinking about Pingzi's trustworthy words—"Be careful of the cigarette case"—he only hoped that he would have a chance to see what Pingzi had put in the cigarette case.

### Frozen Corpses

— Shao Fu

According to the statistics of Tongren Fuyuantang, the number of road corpses collected in the three days from the 27th to the 29th of last month was 316, including 46 adult road corpses and 270 underage child corpses. In the 4.5 million population of Shanghai, the number of road corpses reached almost 3 per 50,000 people. This proportion cannot be said to be not shocking enough.

And the meteorological bureau predicts that the temperature this winter may drop to ten degrees below zero Celsius, reaching the coldest record in the history of this port (December 1927). This is a terrible report.

Human vitality can be called the strongest among animals. It can resist all diseases and disasters. A doctor friend told me that it is not easy to kill a person. Patients with stage III lung disease, with half of their lungs rotten, can still struggle for several years. It can be seen that unless all vitality is truly destroyed, that breath will not be interrupted.

Now, one hundred and five people (average calculation) are frozen to death alive in a single day. Ants still greed for life, is there any human tragedy that can surpass this?

Behind the red doors, wine and meat rot, and on the road, there are frozen corpses. Benevolent people, please save the vagrants on the streets of this city! Isn't it? Letting them die on the roadside, and you appreciate the street scenery in the car, isn't it too unsightly?

To be honest, the existence of this scene for a day only proves our barbarity and shows our shame!

### Q & A on Current Affairs (Continued)

— Hui Qun

Common Sense about the United Nations Translated from English Character Forest West Newspaper

Q: If a country refuses to accept the decision of the council, or refuses to resolve disputes by peaceful means, what will happen? Suppose peace is threatened, and a country launches an aggression, what will happen?

A: At this time, the Security Council can order all member states to cut off all or part of their economic relations with the aggressor country, and cut off transportation and diplomatic relations.

Q: Do all member states have to comply?

A: Yes. Because they have all agreed to implement the decisions of the Security Council.

Q: Is the power of the council limited to this?

A: No. If the Council considers the above methods still insufficient, it may "employ land, sea and air forces to maintain peace."

Q: Is there any force that can be used immediately?

A: Yes. Countries with this obligation should be prepared to provide the Air Force for the Council's use at any time. They must also notify the Council of other sea, land and air forces they are prepared to supply.

Q: Will these forces become international forces?

A: No. The combat plan is decided by the Council and its Military Staff Committee. Unless there is a special agreement, the implementation of this plan is completed by the military forces of each country under the command of the generals of that country.

Q: Which countries are included in the Security Council?

A: Includes the five powers of China, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union, and six countries elected by the General Assembly for a term of two years.

Q: Can any of the five powers prevent the Security Council from discussing any issues raised by small countries?

A: No. The Security Council must take any decision with the full consensus of the five powers. This is because in necessary times, the five powers are responsible for implementing the decisions of the Council. The United Kingdom firmly maintains that the veto power of the five powers should not prevent the Council from discussing the issues raised.

Q: If any of the five powers is also involved in the discussion of a problem, does this power still have the right to vote in the Council?

A: Yes. Members of the Council have the right to vote on any issue - even if it involves their own issues.

Q: Does the trusteeship system make the trust territories never independent?

A: On the contrary, the Charter states that one of the main objectives of the trusteeship system is to assist the trust territories in establishing autonomous governments or complete independence.

Q: The Charter states: All member states undertake to cooperate in resolving international economic, social, and cultural issues. How?

A: The United Nations General Assembly will elect eighteen member states to form the Economic and Social Council, with members serving a three-year term.

Q: What is the mission of this council?

A: Its powers and obligations are very flexible, because this is a major experiment. There has never been such an international economic committee in history, so its progress can only be based on experience.

Q: What exactly does it do?

A: It will investigate all social and economic phenomena and make recommendations—for example, education, labor, and health are all within its scope of tasks.

Q: Are member states obliged to accept its recommendations?

A: No. This would become interference in other countries' internal affairs. However, if it makes a suggestion and a member state refuses to accept it, then the opinions everywhere will know. (End)

Wanted: Fleeing Wool Blanket

### We Want to Investigate

— Ru Yan

Regarding the allocation of woolen blankets, various newspapers in this city have recently published opinions. Yesterday, this publication also mentioned it, but that article said: "We do not wish to investigate whether such a thing actually happened, nor how it came about..." I feel that we should investigate this matter, and immediately. Because many things in the past have become facts through rumors, which makes us unable to "dismiss our suspicions." If there were no plans to allocate them in the first place, that would be fine, but since it was said that they would be allocated, why was the allocation suddenly canceled? First, it was said that there were only ten thousand blankets, then two thousand, and finally it was said that there would be no allocation at all. Where did the woolen blankets go? What trick are they playing? We want to investigate, we want to investigate thoroughly! We want to bring the woolen blankets to justice! These past few days the wind has been so strong, the weather so cold, and the poor public employees are craning their necks, hoping for these blankets to keep warm!

### Please Calm Down

— Zhong Qi

Public employees are outraged by the news that military blankets have been discontinued. The writer would like to defend the responsible authorities: You have often expressed dissatisfaction in the newspapers about the distribution of American goods hindering the production and sales of domestic goods. Now, as you wished, the items bought from foreigners will be resold to foreigners (Jews).

### Don't Need Face

— Suo Bei

After the news of the discontinuation of woolen blankets was released, public employees were deeply indignant, but the Materials Supply Bureau did not explain the reasons, and even brazenly acknowledged "changing the decision midway and selling them at high prices." This kind of frankness is rare, but it still makes people feel: "The skin is too thick," just like what a certain store's advertisement says: "The world is very different now, first let the old face prove it."

What is even more admirable is that the responsible authorities are also silent, "acting as if nothing happened"; to put it bluntly, what more can be said about this kind of "not needing face"?

### Democratic Logic

— Ju Wen

Location: A village meeting in a certain village

Time: After the victory.

Chairman: Do you want peace or war?

People: Peace!

Chairman: That's right. Our party loves peace the most and is willing to use all means to achieve this goal. But the Kuomintang government insists on not wanting peace, they love to create civil war, and they want to attack us... What do you say, are they hateful or not?

People: Hateful!

Chairman: Should we fight them or not?

People: We should fight!

Chairman: Since everyone says we should fight, then let us organize a militia and give those warmongering stubborn elements a righteous blow before they come. Let us organize!

People: ...

Chairman: Remember: Not participating in the militia means not loving peace, and not loving peace means wanting civil war. So not participating in the militia is the initiator of civil war, and we cannot let him exist in our peace-loving society...

People: ???

### Zhang Ji, Who Dares to Be Angry and Speak Out

— Ren Fan

Perhaps, you may be surprised that since the National Revolution unified the country and established its capital in Nanjing, we don't seem to hear much news about Zhang Ji Guang-sheng! Yes, he hasn't held an administrative office for twenty years, but if you review the historical records of the Republic of China's revolution, Mr. Zhang's history and achievements in the country are extraordinary. He often calls himself: "I am a complete 'thug'." In the thirtieth year of Guangxu, this "thug" was arrested in Shanghai for the Wan Fuhua assassination of Wang Zhi-chun case. During the Second Revolution, he was again labeled by Yuan Shikai as a "rebellious element" and ordered to be wanted, fleeing to Japan. Later, during the divided situation of the Republic of China, Mr. Zhang was busy running around for national affairs, wearing a faded robe, a blue mandarin jacket, and a hat, going east to make contact and west to mediate. Everyone knows that Zhang Pu-lao (Zhang's style name is Puquan) is a very responsible person.

Zhang Pu-lao is from Cangxian, Hebei. He has a stout body, is strong, and has an extraordinarily straightforward temper. When there are problems in politics, as long as reporters can find him, he will talk about everything, and his words will be frank and vivid. When foreign countries coveted our country, Pu-lao was one of the most vehement advocates of resistance. I still remember that during the Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang held in Beijing in the 25th year of the Republic of China, Mr. Zhang publicly rebuked the then Ministry of Foreign Affairs' policy of appeasement, his tone and expression were stern, making Minister Zhang blush. After the meeting, Zhang Qun resigned because of this, and the name of the "thug" who dared to speak out became well-known throughout the country.

Mr. Zhang is the most trusted comrade of Mr. Sun Yat-sen. He, along with the late Chairman Lin Sen, Wu Zhihui, and Zhang Jingjiang, were known as the "Four Elders of the Party and State." He is frugal and upright, so although he is an elder of the party and state, he is still a scholar with empty sleeves. Didn't you see the advertisement for "Zhang Ji's Calligraphy" in the newspaper not long ago? - Mr. Zhang's cursive script is quite elegant and forceful.

People engaged in politics seem to inevitably enter the newspaper industry first. Mr. Zhang was an advisor to the Shibao newspaper in the twenty-ninth year of Guangxu. Later, it seems that he also ran a newspaper. Now he is still the chairman of the board of the China Journalism College!

Shanghai Cross-section

### Beggars' Organization 5

— Huang Jiamo

Getting Leftovers Is Not Easy

However, boxed meals, as a means of maintaining cost, their supply of rice is almost just enough, even leaving nothing left after eating. This makes the beggars on the road watch the empty buckets pass by, and they can only swallow their tears of hunger. After learning this lesson, the beggar gangs know that they cannot rely solely on brute force to intercept them, so they painfully pay the cooks of the rice shops as a movement fee. They must ensure that each meal adds more rice, so that the amount of leftovers is considerable and enough to satisfy their hunger. This tribute fee is paid monthly or quarterly, and is paid by the gang's "grand uncles". After the shopkeepers are bribed, the beggars are spared the suffering of hunger. As for the areas where they抢飯（the process of getting leftovers from restaurants), there are regulations, and they cannot invade other territories casually and cause disputes. Moreover, stealing food is done by the younger members, and beggars from outside have no chance to interfere.

"Nailing the Road" and Herding Pigs

"Nailing the Road" is a new begging method invented by the "Old Brothers" beggar gang. It is truly "only one of its kind, with no branches." These people roam the streets, and when they see a fat and fair-skinned respectable person walking by, they immediately intend to follow and beg. People on the road cannot help but become anxious, so they take big steps and walk straight ahead, hoping to escape the pursuit of the beggars. But the beggars "nail" them and refuse to let go. Insiders call this "herding pigs." The fat person is the "pig," and the "pig" automatically walks faster, while the beggars chase after them, and the situation is indeed somewhat like herding. Their use of words is so evil, it is truly extremely hateful!

In the past, those so-called upright beggar gangs never had the rule of following passersby to beg for money. No old brand beggar gang would condescend to do this. But the "Old Brothers" have always considered themselves reformers and did not hesitate to set this bad precedent in Shanghai. This makes it troublesome for people on the road to be attacked by hateful beggars at any time, and it is impossible to send them away without giving them money. If young men and women are walking arm in arm, they are especially considered the most ideal targets by the beggars. Because this is enough to disturb their loving conversation, and if they open up a quick pace because of this, it would be too embarrassing. The smartest way is to reluctantly give them money to send them away. But if other wandering beggars catch a glimpse of this, they will still follow because "there is an example to follow," and you have to spend money again.

The beggars engaged in "nailing the road" are mostly young and addicted to opium. Therefore, although their income is considerable, they are always scantily clad and disgusting. The only way to deal with these people is to cross the street or quickly turn and walk into another cross street. They have no choice but to admit their bad luck. Because "nailing the road" has fixed areas. And because there are many brothers, they have to divide the roads with each other. Each person can only beg on one side of the road. For example, A is on the south side of the street, B is on the north side of the street, C is on the horizontal road in the morning, D is on the horizontal road in the afternoon, and E and F are on the vertical road. Day and night shifts take turns, and they do not interfere with each other. This work of calling the roll is determined by the "grand uncles" of each area. The richness and poverty of each road are different, and a portion of the money earned must be paid to those "grand uncles" who "receive salaries".

Four twin girls celebrate their second birthday.

### Better to Have None Than Bad

— Lan Ge

Let's Talk About Giving Birth to Sons and Daughters

According to a Reuters report on the 28th, an opinion poll was conducted by officials in Paris, and the result was that three children in each family was considered the most ideal. Although there are also those who want to have six or more children or those who do not want to have a family at all, they are always very few.

French women, especially Parisian women, have never liked having children. After this war, it is probably because they felt the "shortage of people," so they are trying their best to encourage fertility.

But Chinese people have always liked to have children and are the best at having children. Generally speaking, the so-called marrying a wife or marrying a husband is, to be honest, for the purpose of having children. The Chinese saying: "There are three unfilial acts, and having no offspring is the greatest," is enough to prove his purpose. As for the saying "raising children to guard against old age," it is even more enough to prove that the Chinese regard children as property.

Therefore, the more children, the better. The more there are, the more it can show that they have fulfilled their "filial piety" and have property. If their wife does not give birth to a single child, the husband can grandly remarry a concubine. As for women, they can only secretly blame themselves for not being up to par, or they will inquire about secret recipes or buy ready-made "gynecological remedies" to eat, so that they can have children.

In this way, Chinese children are finally born, and there are many of them. But they only know how to "give birth," and they have never studied how to "raise" them after they are born. At most, they can let them learn a few English letters or write a family letter in the so-called "school," which is enough. As for how to make children tend towards becoming complete "humans," they don't care.

The future of China is in the hands of these children, so it is dangerous. Therefore, I believe that rather than raising so many children who are only allowed to be born and eat and die, it is better not to give birth for the time being. There is no need to have so many even if we do give birth. If we feel a "shortage of people" in the future, it will not be too late for the government to enact laws to encourage fertility, just like France. At that time, I think the children raised can be "of use".

Children, we should not worry about having too few, but about having too many useless ones.
