### Eight Constitution Draft Review Committees Held Meetings Separately Yesterday, All Except the Second Committee Have Recommended Members for the Comprehensive Committee

[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] The schedule for the Constitution Draft Review Committees' meetings on the 7th and 9th is as follows: The 5th Review Committee will meet at 10:00 AM on the 7th, the 6th Review Committee will meet at 9:00 AM on the 7th, the 1st Review Committee will meet at 3:00 PM on the 7th, the conveners of the 2nd Review Committee will meet at 3:00 PM on the 7th, the 4th Review Committee will meet at 9:00 AM on the 9th, the 3rd Review Committee will meet at 10:00 AM on the 9th, and the 6th Review Committee will meet at 3:00 PM on the 9th.

[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] The first meetings of the first through eighth Constitution Draft Review Committees of the National Assembly were held separately starting at 9:00 AM on the 6th. Some committees broadly expressed opinions on the Draft Constitution, while others made decisions on review methods. Except for the Second Review Committee, where opinions were divided on the National Assembly and the implementation of the Constitution, resulting in disorder and a hasty adjournment before the agenda was completed, the remaining committees all nominated representatives to participate in the Comprehensive Review Committee. The Second, Third, Sixth, and Seventh Review Committees concluded at noon, and did not meet in the afternoon. The First, Fourth, Fifth, and Eighth Review Committees, except for the Fifth, which failed to convene due to an insufficient number of attendees, continued their meetings in the afternoon. A breakdown of the day's activities for each committee is provided below:

First Review Committee

[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] The First Review Committee held its first meeting at the Lizi Society at 9:30 AM, with Zhang Zhiben, Xiao Yishan, and Huang Shaogu serving as chairmen. Two hundred and four review committee members, including Zhang Ji, attended. Huang Shaogu reported that, according to the notification from the General Assembly Secretariat, committees could convene when a quarter of the members were present, and with 204 members present, the quorum was met. Chairman Zhang Zhiben then announced the opening of the meeting and requested that representatives elect two members to participate in the Comprehensive Review Committee in accordance with the law. After deliberation by the representatives, it was decided to elect them by voting, and Huang Shaogu and Wang Bingjun were elected. Subsequently, the review matters were discussed. This group focused on a general discussion of the preamble, general principles, rights and duties of the people, and elections in the Draft Constitution of the Republic of China. The chairman also reported that, according to the Secretariat, all statements and opinions were being compiled, and the proposals received were being printed. Therefore, he requested a general discussion on the review methods and constitutional principles first, as the opinions expressed by the representatives had not been fully compiled, and review could not begin. As for the review methods, there should first be a comprehensive discussion of the opinions already expressed and the constitutional principles, and then subgroup reviews should be conducted. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM.

[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] The First Review Committee continued its meeting at 3:00 PM on the 6th, attended by over forty people, including Zhang Zhiben, Xiao Yishan, Ren Zhuoxuan, Huang Shaogu, and Chen Yiyun. Because the quorum was not met, it was changed to a discussion session, exchanging views on the preamble and Article 1 of the general principles, chaired by Zhang Zhiben.

Yang Dujin spoke, believing that the wording was unclear and the meaning ambiguous. The phrase "based on the teachings of Sun Yat-sen, who founded the Republic of China" should be changed to "in accordance with the teachings of the National Father Sun Yat-sen, who founded the Republic of China." The three principles of nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood should be specifically pointed out below. In Article 1, "The Republic of China is a democratic republic based on the Three Principles of the People, owned by the people, governed by the people, and enjoyed by the people," the words "based on" should be changed to "is," and "democracy" should be changed to "unity," because the three words "republic" already have the meaning of democracy.

Shi Fu spoke, citing three reasons, believing that Article 1 should still be changed to "The Republic of China is a republic based on the Three Principles of the People." If it is not simple and clear, it will not have the flaw of plagiarizing foreign idioms. He said that Article 1 is the most important. If it is vague, it will be enough to affect the overall proposition and should be solemnly amended. After the explanation, the attendees all believed that this kind of empty talk was of no practical value, and it was decided to adjourn the meeting. After the meeting, Zhang Zhiben, Huang Shaogu, and others continued to meet and resolved: (1) Chen Yiyun and Ren Zhuoxuan were mutually recommended as members of the Comprehensive Review Committee; (2) A convener's meeting would be held at Zhang Zhiben's residence at noon on the 7th; (3) The first subgroup plenary meeting would continue at 3:00 PM on the 7th to discuss the preamble and decide on subgroup methods.

Second Review Committee

[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] The Second Review Committee was held in the rest area on the west side of the hall, attended by 374 representatives, including Hu Shi, Peng Xuepei, Zuo Shunsheng, and Kong Geng, chaired by Lin Bin on behalf of Shao Lizi. As soon as the meeting began, Kong Geng proposed that the nature of the National Assembly should be clearly stated in the chapter on the "National Assembly." Some agreed, while others said that concrete discussions should begin only after receiving proposals and widely exchanged opinions records. For a time opinions diverged, and the meeting was in disarray. At 11:00 AM, Chairman Lin officially announced the adjournment of the meeting, and the conveners would meet to discuss the meeting procedures and subgroup methods, and would reconvene after the proposals were delivered. The representatives to participate in the Comprehensive Review Committee, originally scheduled to be elected at that meeting, were also not selected.

Third Review Committee

[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] The Third Review Committee was held in the lounge on the second floor of the hall, attended by 108 representatives, including Zhang Lisheng and Chen Guyuan, chaired by Wang Chonghui. Zeng Qi and Jiang Yuntian were elected as representatives to participate in the Comprehensive Review Committee. As for the review work on the president, administration, and judiciary, because the proposals and records had not arrived, the entire body passed a resolution to adjourn the meeting for two days and resume it at the second meeting on the 9th. The meeting ended at 10:30 AM. The conveners also nominated Wang Chonghui and Wang Shijie as representatives to participate in the Comprehensive Review Committee.

Fourth Review Committee

[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] The Fourth Review Committee was held at the Public Recreation Center at 9:00 AM, discussing Chapters Seven, Eight, and Nine, attended by 75 people including Wu Shenji and Shui Zi, chaired by Jiang Yiping. The committee members extensively exchanged views on Article 83, the Control Yuan's right to approve the appointment of the President of the Judicial Yuan and judges, and whether the Ministry of Judicial Administration should belong to the Judicial Yuan. A majority of the committee members all believed that the Ministry of Judicial Administration should, in principle, be subordinate to the Judicial Yuan. As for the Control Yuan's right of approval, after heated discussions, it was still decided that the issue involved too many aspects and was difficult to make a decision on immediately. It was unanimously decided to discuss it again after the other groups had discussed and achieved some results, and Jiang Yiping, Fan Yushui, Yang Lianggong, and Zhang Weihan were nominated as members of the Comprehensive Review Committee. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM, and the meeting continued in the afternoon for further discussion.

Fifth Review Committee

[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] The Fifth Review Committee met at the Public Recreation Center on the 6th, both morning and afternoon, exchanging views on the chapter on the division of powers between the central and local governments. Fifty-eight people attended in the morning, chaired by Luo Zhuoying, and Huang Luji, Luo Zhuoying, Shi Zizhou, and Wang Shuhui were nominated as members of the Comprehensive Review Committee. The representatives had a heated discussion on issues such as the local system and decided to begin the review after the Secretariat compiled the opinion papers submitted by the representatives.

Sixth Review Committee

[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] The Sixth Review Committee met at the Overseas Chinese Reception Center at 9:00 AM on the 6th, extensively exchanging views on the sparrow county system and nominated Li Jingzhai, Zheng Yanfen, Zhang Bolun, and Liu Zhongyi as members of the Comprehensive Review Committee. Because the proposals had not been compiled, it was changed to continue the meeting at 9:00 AM on the 7th.

Seventh Review Committee

[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] The Seventh Review Committee was held at the National Assembly Hall, attended by 384 representatives, including Yu Bin, Hu Shuhua, Gu Zhenggang, and Lai Lian, chaired by Xiao Zheng. The "Basic National Policies" section was reviewed. Hu Ding'an, a representative of the liberal professions, spoke and requested that provisions for social security be added. He Guoguang, a representative of the military, advocated a special chapter on the economy, and Huang Jianzhong advocated a separate chapter on education. At this point, Gan Naikang, a nominated representative, proposed a subgroup review. The representatives then expressed their opinions on this, with some advocating dividing it into three groups: economy, education, and national defense and foreign affairs; others advocated dividing it into four groups: economy, education, national defense, and foreign affairs. After discussion and voting, it was decided to adopt the latter and add social security, for a total of five groups. The meeting adjourned at 11:10 AM, and after five minutes, it was passed to temporarily adjourn the meeting and reconvene after the proposals, records, and written opinions were delivered to conduct the subgroup review. Gu Zhenggang and Gu Yuxiu were elected as representatives to participate in the Comprehensive Review Committee, and the conveners mutually nominated Chuan Sinian and Lou Tongsun to participate as well. The meeting adjourned at 12:15 PM.

Eighth Review Committee

[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] The Eighth Review Committee was held at the Public Recreation Center at 9:30 AM on the 6th, attended by 80 people, including Fu Sinian and Luo Jialun, chaired by Bai Chongxi. The content of the discussion was the Mongolian and Tibetan local systems. The meeting was lively, with some committee members advocating setting up leagues as provinces and banners as counties, and granting autonomous rights to Inner Mongolia. Other committee members argued that the Mongolian banner system should not exceed the scope of the current organic law, and that the Tibetan local system should continue with the system of religious rule over political affairs. Finally, the opinions of the representatives were summarized, and it was recognized that the regulations on the Mongolian and Tibetan local systems should be properly formulated under the principles of not undermining unity, not dividing the nation, and not harming national defense, which was unanimously applauded by the entire hall. As for the nomination of candidates to participate in the Comprehensive Review Committee, Luo Jialun, He Yangling, Bai Chongxi, and Liu Jianqun were nominated. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM. The meeting continued at 3:30 PM in the afternoon, continuing to exchange views widely. Representatives from Mongolia and other places spoke, all advocating that the status of leagues and banners should be equal to that of provinces and counties, hoping that the constitution could clearly stipulate this point. Representatives from Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan also expressed the same opinions, but there were no resolutions.

### Guangdong Public Organizations Cable the National Assembly, Requesting the Immediate Recovery of Hong Kong

[United Press, Guangzhou, 6th] Twenty-eight public organizations here cabled the National Assembly on the 5th, requesting that measures be taken immediately to recover Hong Kong.

### Zhou Enlai Cables Special Envoy Marshall, Proposing Conditions for Resuming Peace Talks, Intended to Prevent Continued Mediation

[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] Yesterday midday, a rumor spread briefly of the good news that peace talks might resume, because Zhou Enlai sent a letter to Special Envoy Marshall. The letter was delivered at 10:00 AM yesterday, and because its contents were unknown, it was rumored to be the Communist Party's expression of reopening peace talks. Today, the Communist Party announced the contents of the letter, and the so-called reopening of peace talks has proven to be as far-fetched as ever. The contents of the letter are as follows:

Since the opening of the National Assembly, which is manipulated by one party, the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference have been undermined, and the peace talks have lost their foundation. However, in order to comply with the wishes of the people of the whole country for peace and democracy, the Chinese Communist Party has decided to propose that if the Kuomintang immediately dissolves the currently convening National Assembly and restores the troop deployments of January 13, negotiations between the two sides can still be resumed. Please convey this to the government.

[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] After the publication of Zhou Enlai's letter to Special Envoy Marshall, relevant parties stated that the government convened the National Assembly in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, with the participation of people from various parties. It is regrettable that the Communist Party and some members of the Democratic League did not participate. Although the National Assembly has opened, the government still keeps the door open for peace talks and is waiting at any time. However, the Communist Party is repeatedly making political offensives with no sincerity, proposing conditions that make it almost impossible to reopen negotiations in the future. At the same time, the two conditions proposed by the Communist Party, one is to restore the military positions of January 13, and the other is to stop the currently convening National Assembly, are not something that the government can consider.

### Dividing into Smaller Units

— Our Reporters Pu Dejie Yu Zhenji

—Constitution Draft Review Committee Anecdotes

Today began the subgroup review of the Draft Constitution. Eight groups met simultaneously, inside and outside the hall, above and below, east, west, north, and south outside the hall. News reporters, exhausted and bored by the fatigue bombing, began running around again. Newspapers with more pages had nearly ten reporters. Everyone wrote casually. Newspapers with no other branches had one or two people coming and going, filling the ranks. Someone said, "It's just like what Hu Shi said the day before, no eavesdropping, no recording, it's a lot more fun."

At the review meetings, everyone tore off their masks and pulled down their faces. "However" and "but" were not heard much. The debate in the Second Review Committee was ten times more intense than that of the General Assembly, while the Sixth Review Committee was harmonious and relaxed, because the former included the "National Assembly" chapter, while the latter was the "provincial and county system."

In the Second Group, the old man Kong Geng went berserk. After the meeting was in such disarray that it had to be adjourned, the conveners continued to meet in the lounge in the same place to discuss how to divide into subgroups. Old Kong ran to the wall of the information desk next to the staircase in the portico and said, word by word, colorfully: "Regarding the nature of the National Assembly, a clause must be added 'The National Assembly is the highest organ exercising political power in the country.' How can we talk about powers if the nature is not stated? For example, if I am a tiger, I will eat people; if I am a dog, I will eat shit; if I am a mouse, I will squeak, squeak, squeak; if I am a chicken, I will cluck, cluck, cluck……" At the same time, Hu Shi, Peng Xuepei, and others were sitting in the cafe on the second floor, drinking tea. Peng said, "First recommend a few people to discuss it, and explain the pros and cons of dividing into subgroups or not, and it will be much better." Hu said, "Yes, yes! Waiter!"

The Seventh Review Committee held the longest meeting, and the dispute was also over the issue of division into subgroups. Some advocated that national defense, foreign affairs, economy, and education should be divided into four groups for review and research, while others advocated that national defense and foreign affairs should be merged into one group. Gu Zhenggang wanted to fight to set up a special group for "social security," and the crowd echoed. However, everyone unanimously demanded that the review begin only after the Secretariat sent the proposals. As a result, nominations were made arbitrarily, hands were raised infinitely, and after the two representatives attending the Comprehensive Review Committee were elected, the meeting adjourned. Gu Zhenggang had the most votes, 114, and wanted to decline. A representative said: "We all value "social security", so we elected Representative Gu, the current Minister of Social Affairs who is familiar with social situations. We hope Mr. Gu will not decline." So Gu said nothing.

Because the staff of the General Assembly Secretariat's procedural group were extremely busy and exhausted, the General Assembly Secretariat specially invited all the staff of the group to a banquet in the lounge on the second floor of the hall at noon today to show its appreciation. When the reporters found out, they said to each other, "Who appreciates us?"

Over two hundred people attended the First Review Committee in the morning, and it was as lively as a restaurant. Only over forty people attended in the afternoon and it was changed to a "free talk." Some female representatives knew that "talk" would not produce anything worthwhile and left one after another, making the meeting even more deserted.

Zhang Zhiben sighed and said that a small group with more than four hundred people had more people than the National Representative Assembly in those years. The National Political Council had only three or four hundred people, and the entire Legislative Yuan had only a hundred or so legislators. With so many people, the review work could not be carried out.

Hu Shi said that gathering more than four hundred people in one place was like a restaurant with too many mouths and too much noise, and advocated establishing an "expert committee."

The conveners of the First Group mutually recommended members of the Comprehensive Committee. Under the slogan of "respecting women's rights", Chen Yiyun was elected unanimously. The other committee members pushed each other. Xiao Yishan advocated using the method of drawing lots to decide, and even used scrap paper to make two, but in the end, the voting method was still used according to "Elementary Rights of the People", and Ren Zhuoxuan was elected. Huang Shaogu said: Today's situation is similar to the election of the "Student Union President" in those years. (December 6)

### Communist Forces in Jinxi Expand Invasions, Launch Poison Gas Bombs to Besiege Zhongyang, National Forces in Northern Jiangsu Recover Datuan and Biancang

[Our Beiping Office, 6th] The Communist forces in Jinxi are still making every effort to expand their offensive to the north and south. (1) Jixian is surrounded by Communist forces, with a strength of about 4,000. (2) In the Lingchuan and Jiexiu areas, Communist forces have also been constantly attacking National forces strongholds to support their offensive. (3) As of yesterday morning, Zhongyang was still being firmly defended by National forces, but it has been besieged by Communist forces. Almost all the strongholds outside the city have been occupied by Communist forces. However, because the defenders are determined, the Communist forces, although numbering 20,000, have failed to enter the city. On the evening of the 3rd, they fired poison gas bombs into the city and to the north and south, and many soldiers and civilians were poisoned.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 6th] The Communist forces have been attacking Zhongyang for six days and nights, launching dozens of fierce attacks, but they have been courageously resisted by the defenders, causing them heavy casualties. Since the 5th, the Communist forces have been using all their strength, using the "vehicle transport warfare" method, to attack the northern, southern, and western bunkers and the northern and southern river bunkers. The explosives used to bomb each bunker were about two or three hundred catties each. Day and night, wave after wave of charges were launched dozens of times, but they all failed. The intensity of the battle was even greater than the battles of Datong and Xinxian. From dawn to dusk today, the Communist forces continued to attack the bunkers around the city, and it is expected that there will be even more fierce fighting at night.

[Our Beiping Office, 6th] The Communist side claims that the Communist forces in northern Henan crossed the sea route at the end of last month and advanced towards the Yellow River bank. On the 29th and 30th, they captured the National forces strongholds of Muque, Yangcheng, Taigu, Taocun, Dasima, and Jiangqiao between Qinyang, Yangxian, and Wuzhi. On the 2nd, they also attacked Wenxian city and are now expanding their offensive. It is also claimed that after capturing Zhengcheng, the Communist forces in western Shandong captured the county seat on the 3rd, but government sources say that Zhengcheng is still being firmly defended by National forces.

[Our Beiping Office, 6th] Sources say that the situation in Yulin has eased after reinforcements from the National forces. Most of the outposts around Yulin that had been captured by the Communist forces have been recovered by the National forces. The Communist forces have also been reinforced, and there have been small outpost battles for several days. ．

[Our Taixian Office, 5th] After the National forces recovered Liuzhuang, they continued to advance and recovered Datuan on the afternoon of the 4th and occupied Biancang on the afternoon of the 5th.

[Our Zhenjiang Office, 6th] A unit of the National forces in Huaiyin continued to advance north from Wulizhuang and has now stationed in Bridge (five li north of Wulizhuang).

[Our Zhenjiang Office, 6th] Dongtai News: After the National forces recovered Xicao, a small group of Communist forces attempted to counterattack on the morning of the 3rd, but they were repelled by the National forces. The National forces then responded to the request of the Baiju people and advanced in the northwest and southwest directions to protect the return of the villagers. According to people from City: There are now about three regiments of Communist forces that have been reorganized, and their intentions are unclear.

[Our Zhenjiang Office, 6th] It is reported that the Shuyang war has broken out again. The Communist forces have recently increased their troops in Shuyang by about 30,000 from Funing and have invaded Suqian in multiple directions. Xinanzhen and Dayishan are all under siege by the Communist forces.

[Central News Agency, Huaiyin, 6th] The Communist forces have launched multiple attacks on Bazao (northeast of Dongtai) and Biancangzhen (northwest of Dongtai) in recent days. After being severely beaten by the defenders, the Communist forces suffered heavy casualties. The remnants fled in three directions, one fleeing north of the Dafeng Company (eleven kilometers northeast of Bazao), another fleeing back to Fengcheng, and another fleeing to the Xinwang Temple area west of Bicheng.

[Our Jinan Office, 5th] The Communist forces' full-scale offensive in Shandong has been brewing for a long time, but it has not yet been launched due to insufficient strength. However, the units of Liu Bocheng, Chen Zaidao, and Yang Yong have already launched fierce battles with the National forces in the southwest of Zhejiang, attacking the two counties of Jinxiang and Zhengcheng, in order to relieve the main force of the Ninth Division and part of the Fourth Division. The Seventh Division of Zhejiang began to move between Gaoyuan and Tianzhen on the evening of the 3rd, and Yangyan attacked Zhoucun Changshan.

Communist Forces' Movements During the Ceasefire Period

[Our Beiping Office, 6th] Relevant authorities commented on the war situation, saying: During the ceasefire period, the Communist forces' plan was to focus on the northeast, preparing to launch a large-scale winter offensive, deploying 100,000 troops in a fan-shaped formation along the Songhua River bank. The actions in Jinxi and eastern Shandong in Guannei were defensive offensives, not important. However, the Communist forces in Hebei province have also recently become active. The headquarters of the Hebei-Zhongyuan Military Region of the Communist forces has moved from Hejian to County, dividing its units into four groups, each with 20 regiments, preparing to launch an offensive. Its Tenth Military Sub-district has been expanded into the Eighth Sub-district, and recently its main force has moved to the three counties of Yongqing, Xincheng, and Xinzhen in the triangle area of Beiping, Tianjin, and Baoding, attempting to threaten the periphery of Beiping and Tianjin. ，

[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 6th] The Chinese Communist Party spokesman Mei Yi declared today: In the past month, the Chinese Communist military forces have actually preemptively struck on various fronts, and in the future the strength of the "counter-offensive" will be increasingly enhanced. The Chinese Communist military forces will fight to the end to restore the position as of October 13 this year, and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference.

### Sun Li-jen's Interview with Foreign Journalists: All Parts of the Northeast are Calm; Clearing Operations are Underway on the Upper Reaches of the Songhua River

[Special Dispatch from Shenyang, This Newspaper, 6th] The National Army is currently conducting clearing operations on the upper reaches of the Songhua River. It is reported that they have advanced to the line of the Changtao Railway some days ago, and the Nenjiang Provincial Government has dispatched county magistrates to implement administrative affairs.

[Special Dispatch from Peiping, This Newspaper, 6th] Military sources: In the north of the Songhua River, Communist troops have continued to fire machine guns and artillery at the south bank and bridge-building workers in recent days.

The team is divided into thirty groups, each with seven people.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 6th] More than 3,000 Communist troops advanced towards the National Army south of Changling on the evening of the 2nd. They were repelled, and the remnants fled in the direction of Taipingchuan.

[Agence France-Presse, Changchun, 5th] General Sun Li-jen, Commander of the New First Army and concurrently Commander of the Changchun Garrison, stated in an interview with this agency's reporter, Jolson, today: All areas in the Northeast are currently peaceful and normal, especially between Changchun and Harbin, where there is peace and no war. In order to comply with the ceasefire order issued by Chairman Chiang in early November, the National Army will avoid taking any offensive actions. However, in the past week, the National Army was forced to take certain defensive measures to drive the Communist troops out of the Nongan area (Nongan is forty miles north of Changchun). It is reported that the Communist troops have concentrated ten divisions southwest of Harbin, each division with 10,000 soldiers. If the National Army receives orders to attack Harbin, it can occupy Harbin within five days.

[Another Dispatch] Zhao Junli, the Mayor of Changchun, stated: If the National Army recovers Harbin this winter, the political and economic center of the Northeast will be moved from Shenyang to Changchun next spring. Currently, the war is only taking place fifty kilometers northwest and east of Changchun, so it is still too early to immediately transfer the political center.

### The Entire Ping-Sui Railway to be Open by Year-End: Only the Zhangjiakou to Yanggao Section Remains to be Repaired; Commodity Prices in Hebei-Chahar-Suiyuan Have Been Stabilized as a Result

[Special Dispatch from Suiyuan, This Newspaper, 6th] The emergency repair work on the entire Ping-Sui Railway is now only missing completion of the Zhangdui to Yanggao section; it is estimated that the entire line can be opened to traffic by the end of the year. The Railway Bureau has set the 15th as the date for selling through tickets between Peiping and Suiyuan. Prices in Suiyuan have already fallen as a result.

[Special Dispatch from Peiping, This Newspaper, 6th] Traffic circles report: The Ping-Sui Railway, which has been dismembered for a long time, can be restored to full operation around New Year's Day. Currently, the only gap in the entire line, the Zhangjiakou to Dazhou section, has had its eastern section repaired from Zhangjiakou to Tianjin, and its western section repaired from Datong to Yongjiabao. Only two stations in the middle remain to be repaired. If military forces can ensure the security of the entire line, the entire line will surely be open to traffic around the New Year. Since the Ping-Zhang line opened to traffic on the 20th of last month, food, fur, meat, and chestnuts from Chahar Province have been flowing eastward continuously, which has greatly helped to stabilize commodity prices in Peiping and Tianjin. Cloth and daily necessities from Peiping and Tianjin are also surging westward, and the lives of the people of Chahar Province have improved slightly as a result.

### Overseas Chinese in New York Enjoying a Banquet; Feng Yuxiang Delivers a Speech, Saying He is Over Sixty Years Old and No Longer Has Political Ambitions; Emphasizes That China Must Unite and be Unified

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper's Special Correspondent in New York, 6th] The local overseas Chinese organization, "The Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association," hosted a banquet for General Feng Yuxiang at the "Traveling People" restaurant tonight. Mr. Feng delivered his first speech after arriving in New York, stating, "I am sixty-five years old, my temples are already white, and I no longer have political ambitions." A total of 120 overseas Chinese, about twelve tables, attended the banquet. Mr. Feng deeply admired the enthusiasm of the overseas Chinese in America for supporting the National Father's revolution in the past and for enthusiastically donating funds during the eight-year war of resistance against Japan. He also recounted the major sacrifices made by China during the eight-year war of resistance. For example, in Guilin alone, no fewer than five thousand houses were destroyed by bombs and artillery fire. "The Chinese government mobilized 30 million people to participate in combat and battlefield service, and encountered a serious economic crisis in the final stages of the war." Mr. Feng then described the thrift and savings movement he launched in Sichuan in 1943 and 1944, and the people all enthusiastically contributed. There were donations of 10 million and 15 million yuan at a time. After the outbreak of the Shanghai battle in 1937, Mr. Feng was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Third War Zone, and famous generals Chen Cheng, Zhang Zhizhong, Gu Zhutong, Yang Hu, and Zhang Fakui were all under his command. "The battlefield is like a furnace, and it is no easy task for 30,000 troops to charge into battle, kill enemies, and win victories." Mr. Feng expressed optimism about the current domestic political situation, comparing it to the era of Washington and Lincoln in American history. Mr. Feng continued in a firm tone, "China must unite and be unified. I have been a Christian for thirty-five years and have no religious prejudices against Catholicism, Buddhism, or other religions. At the same time, I have been in the military for fifty-three years and have no professional prejudices against farmers, merchants, or industrialists. People from all walks of life are my close friends, such as Bishop Yu Bin, a Catholic, and masters who believe in Buddhism. I am a Kuomintang member and a loyal follower of the National Father Sun Yat-sen, but I have made many close friends from various parties in my life. I often sit at the same table with Zhou Enlai and dine with Chairman Chiang because we are all Chinese compatriots. I know that there are a few troublemakers who intend to slander me, but I can openly say here that I am sixty-five years old and no longer have political ambitions." Mr. Feng then mentioned China's international trade, reminding the people to improve the quality of tung oil and tea leaves. "I have seen countless 'Lipton' tea advertisements in the New York subway. According to American friends, 'Lipton' tea is an improved Indian tea produced by the British, and its sales reach all over the world. Tea is a famous product of China, and my hometown of Anhui produces the famous Lu'an tea, but walking around New York City, I cannot find advertisements for Lu'an tea, which is very strange." New York Consul General Zhang Pingqun and Chairman Chen Zhonghai also spoke at the banquet, introducing Mr. Feng to all the overseas Chinese in America.

### Current Situation in Yikezhao League is Peaceful; League Deputy Leader Dingxia Meets with Fei, Then Flies to Nanking; Restoration Work in Suiyuan and Rehe Mongolian Banners Completed

[Special Dispatch from Gui Sui, 5th] Ewang, the Deputy Leader of the Yikezhao League, recently came to Sui from Zhasak Brigade and is scheduled to fly to Peiping next week to go to Nanking to pay respects to the Chairman. According to him: The current situation in Yikezhao League is extremely peaceful. League Leader Tuwang and Chen Yujia, the representative of Commander Fu, have made thorough arrangements for the security affairs of the Yikezhao League. The security forces of the seven banners of Yikezhao League have all been concentrated, and Chen Yujia has been ordered to maintain the transportation of Yikezhao League and support Yulin.

[Special Dispatch from Peiping, This Newspaper, 6th] Regarding the recent situation in the Mongolian border and the restoration of the Mongolian banners, according to the person in charge of the Peiping Office of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission: During the Anti-Japanese War, the Mongolian banners in Suiyuan were led by Commander Fu Zuoyi of the Twelfth War Zone, and they were able to cooperate fully and always dealt with the enemy and sincerely supported the Central Government. National sentiments became increasingly harmonious, and the various princes and governors of Sui and Mongolian were well aware of the righteousness and contributed greatly during the Anti-Japanese War. After the victory, Sui and Mongolian were the first to complete the restoration work. Currently, in addition to Sui and Mongolian, the restoration work of the Horqin and other Mongolian banners in Rehe has also been completed. Secondly, the restoration work of the twelve banners in Mongolian territory is also being carried out one after another recently. Only the Xilingol League in Chahar is left, which has not yet begun restoration due to its remote location. At present, the security situation in Rehe, Chahar, Sui, and Mongolian is also said to be good. The Central Government is extremely concerned about the disaster situation in the Mongolian banner areas. In May of this year, it allocated 10 million yuan in relief funds, and the Mongolian compatriots were able to receive a small share. There are currently 1,000 Mongolian people in Peiping City, most of whom have difficult lives. The Peiping Office of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission recently requested the Peiping-Tianjin branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to provide flour relief, with each person receiving 30 pounds and a can of condensed milk. Although this is a small amount, it can help in case of emergency, and relief matters can still be handled in the future. After the Mongolian banner areas were occupied, eight years of nomadic life were mostly destroyed. Rebuilding the Mongolian banners and guiding the lives of the Mongolian people in the future will be important tasks.

[Special Dispatch from Peiping, This Newspaper, 6th] The Peiping Headquarters has decided to establish a Mongolian Banner Issues Research Group, chaired by Councilor Wang Hongshao, which will bring together various relevant agencies and scholars from various Mongolian Banners. It will be established in the near future to study Mongolian Banner issues and serve as a reference for policy implementation. Fu Zuoyi also agrees with this. It is reported that Li Zongren has made some suggestions to the Central Government on the Mongolian Banner issue in Nanking, asking that the demands of the Mongolian compatriots be taken seriously.

### Canal Passing Through the Yellow River Project:

After the Jiaolai Canal is opened, maritime transportation can avoid the dangerous promontory of Chengshan Cape, shortening the voyage by 500 kilometers. It can also promote the development of the rich resources of eastern Shandong, benefit the Rong Qingdao industry and commerce, and have great significance for coastal defense.

### Ensuring Peace in the Pacific: Reflections on the Fifth Anniversary of the Pacific War

Today, we are reluctant to recall the events of five years ago. We have not forgotten: the events of this day five years ago and those that followed are as vivid as if they happened yesterday. History has already made its definitive judgments on these events; further attacking or condemning them would be a departure from the traditional Chinese virtue of forgiveness. The facts of five years ago are clearly imprinted in everyone's mind and plainly written in history textbooks. We seem to have no need to dwell on these facts any further. Although the trials of Japanese war criminals have yet to reach a verdict, their crimes against humanity need no further pointing out. Their fate will inevitably resemble that of the Nuremberg war criminals. Therefore, we seem to have no need to recall the tragic events of five years ago today; instead, we should sympathize with the plight of the Japanese people today. We sympathize with them because they are suffering the consequences of being under the tyrannical rule of militarists. Chairman Chiang's proclamation to the Japanese people after their surrender remains deeply etched in their hearts today because of our spirit of forgiveness. Needless to say, we were the nation most severely invaded by Japanese militarists; precisely because of this, we can extend the greatest sympathy to the Japanese people.

However, today we must not forget the lessons of history. We should examine the factors that led to the events of five years ago and, furthermore, prevent a recurrence of similar events to ensure lasting peace in the Pacific. Since the beginning of recorded human history, this vast Pacific Ocean has never experienced anything like the events of the past five years. Magellan thought the Pacific was peaceful, but who knew that the Pacific would give rise to an unprecedented calamity for humanity? Who would have thought that the first atomic bomb ever created by mankind would fall on Hiroshima in the Pacific? But these are already history: what we should explore is the reason why. The reason is simple: it is the rise of militaristic Japan. Japan is a peripheral nation in Asia. It accepted Chinese culture but rejected its core. This is similar to how the Germanic peoples of Northern Europe were peripheral nations during the Roman Empire. Because it was a peripheral nation, it was full of vitality and was able to achieve industrialization in a very short period. And with sufficient armaments, it was eventually able to collude with Nazi Germany to form the Axis. Therefore, it was Japan under the rule of militarists, the Japanese army, especially the Japanese navy, that destroyed the eternal peace of the Pacific.

Today, if we want to ensure lasting peace in the Pacific, given the various events of the past, we must be vigilant. In fact, vigilance is not enough; it must be answered with action. What is this action? It is that we must maintain sufficient armaments in the Pacific. The Pacific is vast, and we must first maintain a sufficient navy. Although the use of atomic bombs was a factor in the recent Pacific War, it still demonstrated the importance of the navy. The peace of the Pacific was destroyed mainly due to the rise of the Japanese navy. Now that the Japanese navy has been annihilated, we cannot allow another hostile navy to rise again and destroy the peace of the Pacific; on the active side, we must reorganize our navy. In the previous Pacific War, the United States Navy fulfilled its historical mission; therefore, for the subsequent assurance of peace in the Pacific, we cannot help but place our hopes on the United States Navy, which annihilated the Japanese Navy that disrupted peace in the Pacific. Therefore, today, as we commemorate the fifth anniversary of the Pacific War, we must first express our respect to the United States Navy, and furthermore, ask the American people, for their own safety, to maintain sufficient naval power in the Pacific. As for ourselves, we must frankly say that our national strength does not allow us to possess a powerful navy, but our navy must assume an unavoidable responsibility: that is, our navy must have the power to ensure peace in the western Pacific. How can we enable our navy to fulfill this responsibility? This depends on the wise measures of our government authorities.

However, the military is ultimately a matter of national affairs. Those who are good at using the military do not use it, but it is essential to be prepared. Therefore, if we want to ensure peace in the Pacific, we cannot rely solely on military preparations; we must find other ways in addition to military preparations. The destruction of peace is used for war, and in the eyes of some politicians and political commentators, war is only a continuation of national policy. When conflicts in national policy cannot be resolved, they have to resort to force. This tone is more likely to come from politicians than strategists. Therefore, the key to ensuring peace lies not in strategy but in political strategy. It is the responsibility of political strategists to ensure that national policies avoid conflict. In today's world, especially in the Pacific world, we cannot but recognize the existence of divisions. Whether efforts to eliminate these divisions are futile is something that future history will write its lessons about. At this moment, we should not ask about the outcome and ignore the efforts that should be made. Today, we have the United Nations organization, which is more advanced than the League of Nations of the past. Under this international organization, we should be able to ensure lasting peace in the Pacific and even the world. There should be no disputes and conflicts that cannot be resolved. Due to the development of scientific weapons, humanity should no longer slaughter each other but be able to live together in peace.

On this fifth anniversary of the Pacific War, we offer our sincerest tribute to the countless heroic souls buried on the deserted islands of the Pacific, in the forests of Burma, and on the Asian continent. It is because of their sacrifice that mankind was able to overcome a cruel war. May mankind learn from this how to get along with each other so that the Pacific can ensure its eternal peace.

### How to Eliminate the Phenomenon of Shields

Since the victory, there have been many extremely contradictory phenomena in the economic sector. Here are a few examples: (1) On the one hand, there is an excess of idle funds, inflation, and rampant speculation; on the other hand, credit is extremely tight. High interest rates cannot be reduced. (2) Cotton is in short supply, and there are calls to expedite the importation of American cotton; at the same time, the local cotton in Pudong is not being purchased, and cotton farmers are struggling to find a way out. (3) According to the Shanghai Textile Association, there is a monthly surplus of 33,682 bales of yarn, but the yarn allocation quota is only 40%, making it impossible for the re-allocation committee to manage, and the black market for cotton yarn cannot be eliminated. (4) Coal prices are soaring, and the Fuel Management Committee does not have enough coal to supply; but merchants are not allowed to freely purchase coal to replenish their reserves. (5) Unemployment fears are very serious. There are no effective measures to help them find jobs, but there are still intentional or unintentional efforts to take away their existing livelihoods. (6) Pumps can be imported, but belts are not allowed to be imported, and there are no suitable domestic products to replace them. All of this leaves many importers and users confused. (7) Scarcity makes things expensive. Kerosene prices have already risen, but there are reports that several oil tankers are still anchored outside Wusong Port, unable to enter. (8) Knowing that foreign goods are being dumped and that domestic products are unable to compete, everyone is still greedy for limited cheap goods and is unwilling to find ways to reduce production costs or to purchase domestic goods to protect them together. This is true of private individuals, and it is also true of public entities. (9) The monthly trade deficit is truly alarming, and the general domestic industry is so fragile; yet there are still people who echo and advocate free trade. (10) Prices are rising steadily, and people's livelihoods are difficult, but the prices of many goods are said to be insufficient to cover costs.

Faced with such a series of facts, we, as third parties, cannot help but feel dizzy. Each party involved naturally has its own reasons and its own one-sided rationale. But we believe that the above-mentioned contradictory phenomena are undoubtedly caused by these one-sided rationales. Everyone is looking out for their own interests, everyone is doing their own calculations, and while they may say nice things on the surface, they are meticulously calculating every penny and unwilling to budge an inch. In that case, how can these contradictory phenomena be eliminated?

Merchants seek profit from capital, and their purpose is to make a profit. As the saying goes, "Do everything, but don't do it at a loss." Of course, we cannot demand too much from them from the perspective of public welfare or charity. But we always hope that all parties will earnestly implement the laws and regulations promulgated by the government, or the temporary measures agreed upon by both officials and merchants, such as various negotiated prices and allocations, and that they will no longer harbor intentions of taking advantage or evading them.

As for state-owned enterprises or national economic policies, their sole purpose is not to make profits or govern the people. The overall planning and regulation of the market can be said to be their inescapable responsibility. For the above-mentioned contradictory phenomena, there is probably no other way to remedy them except by using the power of the state to adjust surpluses and deficits and to find ways to compensate for them. Especially the issues of materials and prices. We certainly hope that the authorities will have a clear and well-defined plan. However, these issues are all very complex and cannot be solved with a few empty words or by taking from the east to supplement the west. If controls are to be implemented, there must be a complete plan and a systematic approach; and considerable sacrifices must be made in terms of manpower and resources. To give an example, the United States and Hong Kong provide considerable subsidies for certain low-priced items under rationing, and they do not require merchants to bear excessive losses. This alone shows that managing price controls or rationing is not an easy task.

We believe that if something can be controlled, it should be controlled comprehensively. From production to consumption, there must be appropriate coordination and close links, and no one should be allowed to take advantage of any loopholes. Fragmented implementation is not allowed. If everything cannot be grasped and it is actually impossible to plan overall, then it is better to adopt a laissez-faire attitude and let them seek natural adjustment. Otherwise, dealing with things piecemeal will only cause more disturbances, and the various contradictory phenomena will become even more pronounced.

### US Troops on the Beining Line to Be Completely Withdrawn Within a Month: Official Announcement by the US Military Authorities

[United Press, Peiping, 6th] The US military authorities here announced today: The US troops responsible for protecting the railway on the Beining Line will withdraw within the next two weeks before the end of this month. The first and second battalions of the 7th Regiment will be transferred from Qinhuangdao and Beidaihe back to the west coast of the United States. There have been no US troops in Tangshan since September 30. After this withdrawal of US troops, there will only be US troops stationed in Peiping, Tianjin, Tanggu, and Tsingtao in North China. The mission of the US troops in Peiping, Tianjin, and Tanggu will be to maintain the supply line for the US representatives of the Peiping Executive Headquarters. The US troops stationed in Tsingtao belong to the 7th Fleet, and they are training Chinese naval officers there. Except for Qinhuangdao and Beidaihe, the remaining US troops on the Beining Line were completely withdrawn in mid-October, and the railway line was taken over by the National Army. After the withdrawal of the 7th Regiment, the number of US troops from the 1st Marine Division remaining in North China will be less than 15,000. The 2nd Battalion of the 5th Regiment is stationed in Peiping, the 1st and 2nd Regiments and the division headquarters are stationed in Tianjin, the 1st Battalion of the 5th Regiment is stationed in Tanggu, and the 3rd Battalion of the 4th Regiment is stationed in Tsingtao.

[United Press, Peiping, 6th] An American observer here told a United Press reporter today: After the withdrawal of US troops from Qinhuangdao and Beidaihe, the CCP will still demand the continued withdrawal of the remaining US troops in North China. It is said that the US troops stationed in China are good propaganda material for the CCP, especially since the anti-American sentiment incited by the CCP has reached a climax. According to a US source, it is expected that the Communist Party may use this withdrawal of US troops to promote the idea that the United States has realized that it was wrong to station troops on the Beining Line and is now correcting its past mistakes.

### Daqing Railway Under Repair: Liulihegou Railway Soon to Be Open for Coal Transport

[Our Newspaper, Xinxiang News] The Daqing Railway is being urgently repaired. The Pinghan Railway Bureau has set a deadline of one month to complete the traffic from Xinxiang to Jiaozuo (65 kilometers) as soon as possible and may extend it to Qinghua (Bo'ai). The Railway Bureau has now sent five engineers to Xinxiang to assist in the work, and the materials for repairing the railway will also arrive soon. According to a senior official of the Xinxiang Railway, work will begin as soon as the materials for repairing the railway arrive, and it has been decided that both sides will repair the railway from both ends. Because 8,000 rails were found between Jiaozuo, the Jiaozuo side has already started work first. One large Type 2-8-2 locomotive that was destroyed by the Communist army in Xiuwu has been ordered to be repaired, and more than 30 military cars may be used. There is now a large quantity of coal in the Jiaozuo coal mine. Once traffic is restored, it can be transported out in a steady stream.

[Our Newspaper, Xinxiang News] According to reports, the entire Fengli Railway, which is 36 kilometers long, was completely repaired by the railway engineering team at 5:00 PM on November 30. A test run was conducted on the first of this month, and the situation was still good. It can be opened for coal transport soon. From then on, there will be no worry about coal for industrial use in northern Henan, and the coal problem for locomotives on the Pinghan and Longhai lines will also be solved. Now the Xinxiang Power Plant is actively sorting out the lines. After the coal is transported, it can shine brightly. According to visitors, the Liulihegou coal mine was damaged by the Communist army, causing the mine shafts to be eroded by water, and most of the mining machinery was taken away. Although a batch of mining machinery was found in the territory of Cixian a few days ago, it cannot be pumped because the power supply was destroyed. The repair work is quite difficult. Li Guangyao, the commissioner for receiving the Liulihegou coal mine, who is currently staying in Anyang, is about to go to receive and rectify it.

### Chairman Chiang Cables Jiangsu Provincial Government: Military Grain Must Not Be Delayed; Zhenjiang Garrison District Clarifies Conscription Rumors

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 6th] Chairman Chiang cabled an order yesterday to the Jiangsu Provincial Government to allocate military grain in accordance with quotas and deliver it to the supply stations as scheduled, and not to delay it. If the supply of military grain in the Xuhai, Northern Jiangsu, and Northern Anhui areas is interrupted, the cause should be identified and remedied immediately. If there are any cases of arrears or delayed collection, it should be explained clearly within ten days of the cable's arrival. If there is any further delay, it will be treated as delaying military opportunities. After receiving the cable, the Provincial Government urgently cabled all counties to quickly deliver the November military grain quota. [Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 6th] After the implementation of the first phase of conscription in Jiangsu, due to the uneven quality of the enforcement personnel or improper procedures, there were inevitably some disturbances, resulting in disputes in some counties. It is reported that the highest conscription agency has issued strict warnings. If anyone takes the opportunity of conscription to extort, harass the people, or abuse recruits, they will be sentenced to death upon investigation. It is learned that the original quota for conscription in Zhenjiang was 466, and 240 have now been accepted by the garrison district. Among them, there are quite a few only sons from poor families, whose families applied for a postponement of conscription in accordance with the law, but were not approved. According to the responsible authority, this matter is still under consideration.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang News] The conscription affairs in this county have been successfully completed so far. However, it was rumored in the city a few days ago that some recruits who had joined the army had escaped or committed suicide. For this reason, our newspaper reporter specifically visited a person in charge of the garrison district. According to him, the recruits' lives are very comfortable after joining the army, and there have been no adverse incidents. There are now many counties that are obstructing the conscription process, which is purely due to ulterior motives. It is hoped that the families of all recruits will not easily believe the rumors from the outside world and cause anxiety. If any traitors deliberately create rumors and cause trouble, they will be prosecuted for undermining military service once discovered.

### Township Head of Heqing Township, Chuansha, Accused

[Our Newspaper, Chuansha News] Gu Xingmei, the head of Heqing Township in this county, held a position during the enemy puppet regime. He used his power to oppress the villagers and carry out large-scale looting. After the victory, he changed his name to Gu Chengxiang and continued to serve as township head. Recently, he was ordered to conscript recruits, and there were many malpractices. The villagers have now collected evidence of his crimes and filed a complaint with the county government.

### Flying Thief Li Shengwu to be Sentenced Today: During Public Trial, He Compared Himself to a Benevolent Person, Claiming His Stolen Gains Were Used to Aid the Poor

[Special Dispatch from Jinan] The case of flying thief Li Shengwu, which caused a sensation in Jinan society, has been investigated by the Jinan District Court for several sessions. On the afternoon of the 2nd of this month, at 2:00 PM, it was publicly tried in the court's criminal division. The trial concluded around 5:00 PM, and the sentencing was scheduled for the 7th of this month. During the trial, Li confessed to all thefts without hesitation, but stated that two points needed explanation: first, he did not intend to kill Xue Gan臣's mother and wife; second, although he committed theft, the stolen funds were all donated to the Jinan Relief Institute and orphanages under the name of an anonymous person. He requested the court to investigate. The defendant's lawyer, Xu Qinglin, made a defense favorable to the defendant, divided into three points: (1) The defendant did not collaborate with the enemy during the enemy-puppet period, nor did he join the bandits. He came to Jinan alone and faced difficulties in obtaining food and clothing. His stealing behavior was perhaps due to being forced by life's circumstances and is indeed excusable. (2) Regarding the defendant's killing of Xue Gan臣's mother and wife, it was found that the defendant and Xue were old friends, but Xue arrested Li and imprisoned him. Li later escaped. According to the defendant, he went to Xue's house to explain, but Xue's mother and wife pretended to comfort him at the time, possibly with the intention of alerting the authorities. He could not have escaped without killing them. (3) Regarding the defendant shooting Li Qinlu, with the defendant's skill, killing him would have been as easy as turning his hand, but Li only shot him in the leg and foot, clearly indicating no intention to kill. He requested the court to reduce his sentence.

(2) The provincial capital's winter relief program was requested from the provincial government to be implemented promptly via telegram.

### Fanhwangdu Road Urgently Needs Repair

The municipal authorities are renovating the city's appearance and facilitating transportation, with all roads being repaired one after another. However, Fanhwangdu Road (the section from Wujiaochang to Sanjiaochang) has not been attended to. This road is also a major transportation route with heavy traffic. The damage to the road surface is unbelievable. Whenever it rains, the mud is ankle-deep, and passersby are full of complaints. Now that the rainy and snowy season has arrived, the mud on the road surface may never dry. We residents of this section are also taxpayers and it seems the municipal authorities disregard the road condition. (Xin Yong respectfully submitted)

The wooden bridge on Jiaxing Road in Hongkou East should have been repaired long ago.

At night, thieves steal the bridge planks, and the holes are getting larger every day. Pedestrians find it difficult to pass, and rickshaws often fall (there are no streetlights on this road), obstructing traffic and harming appearances, which is a significant issue. It is hoped that the authorities will pay attention and expedite the repairs to facilitate transportation. (Sun Wenbing)

[News Report] San Francisco, 6th (Broadcast): Byrnes urged the other three foreign ministers today to sign peace treaties with Germany's five former satellite states before Christmas, so that this year's Christmas will be a truly peaceful Christmas. Byrnes also proposed to begin discussing the German peace treaty starting next week.

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 5th] The four foreign ministers, in a spirit of coordination, resolved all major outstanding issues in the five-nation peace treaties today. Except for a few technical and minor issues that can be quickly resolved by the representatives of the four foreign ministers, the peace treaties with Italy, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Finland have been definitely agreed upon. The four foreign ministers are expected to begin discussing the German issue around Monday of next week. The representatives of the four foreign ministers and the four foreign ministers themselves will hold meetings one after another tomorrow to review the final reports submitted by economic and naval experts. The time and place for the signing of the treaties have not yet been determined. Since the final texts need to be produced in English, French, and Russian, they will not be signed in New York, as the chief representatives will all be leaving New York early. The four foreign ministers agreed on the following aspects today:

(1) "The Danube River Issue": Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov agreed to insert a clause on the freedom of navigation on the Danube River into the Romanian treaty. This clause stipulates that an international conference will be convened within six months after the treaty comes into effect to draft a permanent convention. (2) "The Reparations Issue": Italy will pay $125 million in reparations to Yugoslavia, $105 million to Greece, and $25 million each to Abyssinia and Albania. Bulgaria will pay $25 million each in reparations to Yugoslavia and Greece. Regarding the proportion of compensation for wartime losses of Allied nationals, the Paris Conference recommended compensating 75% of the original value, which has now been reduced to two-thirds. (3) "The Romanian Oil Price Issue": The four foreign ministers adopted yesterday's procedure, that is, the governments of the countries concerned should first negotiate directly. If they cannot reach an agreement, the ambassadors of the four powers will continue to discuss. If they still cannot reach an agreement, the Secretary-General of the United Nations will appoint an arbitrator to make the final decision.

Other points agreed upon were: (1) the Soviet Union does not object to the right of the Trieste Free Territory to join international organizations; (2) former enemy countries are prohibited from using torpedo boats; (3) if Yugoslavia refuses to sign the treaty, it will be deprived of its due benefits.

### International Control of Atomic Energy: US Representative Proposes New Plan, Hoping the Soviet Union Will Participate in Cooperation

In his opening remarks, he stated briefly that the commission is an independent body and that any decisions made by the UN General Assembly's Political and Security Committee should not interfere with the commission's resolutions. British Representative Shawcross spoke next, stating briefly, "Establishing an international organization to strengthen the control of atomic energy and promoting the application of atomic energy to peaceful goals is an urgent task. We urgently hope to lift all curtains and open all doors to enhance the effectiveness of this control. Our greatest hope is that all countries, including the Soviet Union, will agree with our views." At this point, US Representative Baruch put forward a control plan, the main points of which are as follows:

(1) Establish an international atomic energy management system, the definition and function of which shall be determined by a multilateral treaty. In this treaty, all countries are equal. (2) The management system shall take effect after a majority of countries ratify the treaty. (3) The treaty must stipulate the appointment of an international organization within the United Nations framework to enable countries to exchange information on atomic research, prohibit the use of atomic energy for destructive purposes, and at the same time promote the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes. (4) The organization should seek convenience in carrying out control work in various countries' territories, prohibit the production, possession, and use of atomic weapons, trace violators, consider the international crimes constituted by violators, and decide the nature of the punishment for violating countries. (5) The supervisory organization shall not use the veto power when investigating cases of violation, so as to prevent the violating party from evading punishment. (6) The Atomic Energy Commission should include this plan in its report to the Security Council at the end of this year.

When proposing this plan, Baruch earnestly hoped for the participation of the Soviet Union and said, "We can accomplish the control of atomic weapons if we wish. The complete elimination of war is in our hands, and we are willing to work with you to achieve it."

### France's New Prime Minister Difficult to Produce: Bidault Fails in Second Vote

[Reuters, Paris, 5th] After Communist leader Thorez failed to be appointed Prime Minister yesterday due to insufficient votes, the National Assembly held a second election today. However, Bidault of the Popular Republican Movement also failed to obtain the required number of votes, receiving only 240. During the vote, the Popular Republican Movement and the conservatives supported Bidault, but the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the Radical Party all opposed him, choosing their own candidate, Betti te. The National Assembly will hold a third prime ministerial election next Tuesday. It is expected that the parties will seek a compromise solution under the auspices of Speaker Auriol over the weekend to resolve the government crisis as soon as possible. It is generally expected that the position of Prime Minister should belong to the Socialist Party or the Radical Party, and the government should include all parties except the Republican Liberty Party and the far-right parties. Gouin of the Socialist Party and Herriot of the Radical Party are considered ideal candidates for Prime Minister. Experienced observers believe that such a government would be more stable.

### Five US Congressmen Arrived in Shanghai from Peiping Yesterday: Discussing Peace in the Pacific is Peace in the World

[Reported by This Newspaper] Isaac, Chairman of the Naval Subcommittee of the US House of Representatives, accompanied by Congressmen Beemiller, Bishap, Hurley, and Mansfield, arrived in Shanghai from Peiping by plane at 11:30 yesterday morning. At 3:00 yesterday afternoon, a reception was held for reporters at the Hua Mao Hotel, with US Seventh Fleet Commander Admiral Cooke in attendance. Congressman Mansfield did not attend due to other commitments.

During the reception, Congressman Isaac reported on the mission of this trip, which was to complete the work of inspecting the Pacific islands and visiting various parts of China last year. Mr. Isaac and others visited the Pacific islands in June and July last year, when Wake Island and other places were still under Japanese control. This time, they came to the Far East again and visited Qingdao, Tianjin, and Peiping in China. They will leave Shanghai on the 8th for Okinawa Island and then Manila, and are expected to return to the United States in early January next year to report to the House of Representatives. The purpose of their inspection is not only to understand the situation of US military bases for US reference, but also to make an observation for international peace. Mr. Isaac gave his personal opinion, saying: "I deeply feel that there is a close and good relationship between China and the United States. If China and the United States work together side by side, it will not be difficult to maintain peace in the Pacific. At the same time, I can guarantee that peace in the Pacific is a guarantee of peace in the world."

When a reporter asked Mr. Isaac which country the US military was establishing bases in the Pacific to defend against, Mr. Isaac replied: "It is to defend against any country that wants to destroy the world peace of the next five thousand years. The establishment of bases is not a plan for three or five years."

Mr. Isaac continued: In addition to establishing a complete administrative area, the US military in the Pacific islands also has a humanitarian mission, that is, the US military should protect and assist the residents of the islands, and implement its promise in accordance with the consistent policy of the United States, leading the natives to independence and autonomy, such as the construction of a new country in the Philippines. Mr. Isaac deeply fears that the US Congress will decide to cut the navy and repeat historical tragedies. Mr. Isaac believes that the navy is a great force for maintaining peace, and if it is reduced, it will affect security. He also said that China and other countries recognize the Pacific as the US ocean, and the United States has a very large mission in the Pacific. Mr. Isaac denied that the US Navy has any bases in China, saying that Shanghai is not a base, and Qingdao can be called a temporary base, but in fact Qingdao is China's naval base. At the request of the Chinese government, the US Navy has a naval training school there, and there are currently a number of US naval officers teaching at the school. The United States is willing to do its best to help China.

Finally, Mr. Isaac also answered reporters' questions about the policy toward Japan, which is to assist the Japanese people in taking the path of true democracy, allowing the Japanese people to strive for freedom of speech, action, and various freedoms. Judging from the current situation, the Japanese people are not dissatisfied with the policies implemented by the United States in Japan.

### Factory Range Temporarily Divided into Three Zones; Yesterday's Municipal Meeting Passed Management Rules

[Reported by This Newspaper] In order to facilitate the supervision of factories in this city and protect the safety of citizens, the Municipal Government has formulated the Shanghai Municipal Rules for the Management of Factory Site Addresses. It is stipulated that the range of factories to be established in this city is temporarily divided into three types of areas: A, B, and C. The details are as follows:

1. Zone A: Permanent factories may be established, and the scope is defined as follows: (3) The first zone is in the Caobajdu Suzhou Creek area (bounded by the railway to the north, Kangding Road to the south, and Suzhou Creek to the east of St. John's University). (2) The second zone is 2,000 meters west of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, and the three sections of land along the Suzhou Creek to the west, the scope of which is: (A) North of Suzhou Creek: 1,000 meters north to the east, 1,100 meters north to the west, and the connecting line within the scope.

Temporary constructions such as the improvement of sanitary and fire protection equipment, as well as the addition of workshops, etc., which are not related to the expansion of production, are temporarily allowed to be added.

The above measures have been approved by yesterday's municipal meeting and will be announced and implemented soon.

### The O'Hare Bureau Suspects War Criminals; Regardless of Guilt or Innocence, All Will Be Repatriated for Reception; Increased Income May Be Tried Again

[Reported by This Newspaper] The second batch of German overseas Chinese deportation list has been announced by the authorities, but because it includes the O'Hare Bureau suspected war criminals who are currently being tried by the US military court, the deportation date will be determined after the court has completed its trial and judgment. According to the 27 defendants of the O'Hare Bureau, except for Shen Ke and other six people who have been acquitted, the rest are still in the witness testimony stage, which will take about two weeks. According to Prosecutor Major O'Connor yesterday, all defendants, regardless of whether they are convicted or acquitted, will be deported to Germany for execution, release, or other disposition. Because the "Purge of Nazi Elements Court" has been established in the US-occupied zone of Germany since the end of the war, specializing in the trial of lower-level officials of the Hitler government, secret police, and other Nazis, even if the O'Hare Bureau defendant is declared innocent by the US military court here, they may still be tried again by the court after returning to the country.

### Chinese-Style Dance Drama is Maturing: "Meng Jiang Nu's" Techniques a Success, Paving a New Path for Chinese Art

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Ah Fu Shamulov's "Meng Jiang Nu" has premiered, which is welcome news.

Regardless of the differing opinions and various criticisms from the audience, it is an undeniable fact that Mr. Ah has found a new way of performing and a new "tool" (Medium) for conveying art for Chinese art. Today, Kunqu Opera has gradually become a thing of the past with the decline of "literati and scholars." As for Peking Opera, although the lineup at Shanghai's Peking Opera theaters is still at its peak, it is sadly a case of "a final burst of glory." May I ask, even with Mei Lanfang's skillful leadership, will there ever be eternal youth? What is likely to take its place are the colorful lights of the Gong Stage and the seductive gestures of female performers!

Reforming Peking Opera has yet to achieve significant results. On the contrary, "popular literature" is gradually rising to prominence and achieving considerable success. Dai Ailian's experimentation has given us a very fresh impression, and her success lies in her finding a new path from popular literature and folk art.

Art cannot be separated from the masses.

In fact, the attempt to adapt Chinese folk tales into opera is not without precedent in our art circles. As far as this writer knows, during the period of Japanese occupation in Beiping and Tianjin, there were already people working diligently to adapt "Mulan Joins the Army" into an opera. Unfortunately, Wang Shouhui, who diligently wrote the lyrics, did not complete his work and died young in frustration! At the same time, Ah Fu Shamulov first attempted a Chinese-style dance drama and achieved unprecedented success. This dance drama was "A Dream in an Ancient Temple." From the success of "A Dream in an Ancient Temple," those who care about the future of Chinese art predicted that Chinese-style opera was gradually taking shape. Sure enough, today we see "Meng Jiang Nu." The composition of "Meng Jiang Nu" does inevitably have its shortcomings. Even though Mr. Ah has been in China for decades, even though he has a great love for Chinese music and has put in a lot of effort, music is a cry from the deepest part of a nation's soul, fleeting and elusive, yet clear as day. A slight error in judgment will lead to a huge difference. Not to mention previous works such as "In a Chinese Temple," Mr. Ah's efforts give us the same feeling as Pearl S. Buck's Chinese characters—they only grasp the outline and not the substance; they have types, but no individuality. How many associations should the word "Suzhou" evoke in the heart of a Chinese person? Even if Mr. Ah works hard, how many associations can he make? What we pay attention to and admire is the technique. Thirty years ago, the Spring Willow Society staged "La Dame aux Camélias." Today, our spoken drama has gained a firm foothold. We firmly believe that this "Meng Jiang Nu" will have the same effect as "La Dame aux Camélias" in the past, and will spark continuous efforts leading to brilliant achievements in the future. We must start with "popular literature," and it is we Chinese who should take on this responsibility.

### Rewarding House Construction to Solve Housing Shortage: Municipal Public Land Leased; Municipal Government Sets Rules

In addition to the Social Affairs Bureau working with the Public Works Bureau to build public housing to solve the housing problem for the common people, the city actively encourages citizens to build houses; and municipal public land can be leased for citizens to build on. The municipal government has formulated rules for implementing the reward for building houses on leased public land. The main points are as follows: (1) In order to alleviate the housing shortage and encourage construction, the Land Administration Bureau will, after a resolution by the municipal government meeting, announce the leasing of suitable municipal public land for building houses in stages. (2) Those who build houses for their own residence have priority in leasing. (3) For the public land leased in the preceding paragraph, within two months from the completion of the lease formalities, a construction permit must be obtained from the Public Works Bureau, and construction must be commenced within six months. Failure to do so will result in the cancellation of the original lease agreement. (4) Reduction and exemption of various taxes on newly built houses. It shall be handled in accordance with the city's fundamental solution to the housing shortage. (5) When the lease term of public land expires, the lessee may, three months before the expiration, submit a request to the Land Administration Bureau to renew the contract and continue the lease. However, if the government has other uses for the land, it will notify the lessee three months before the expiration. If the lessee does not want to demolish the building, the government may give appropriate compensation and take it over for public use. The above implementation rules were approved by the 58th municipal government meeting held yesterday.

### Christian Congress Discusses Strengthening Church Organization

### Demolition of the Walls of the Ai Li Garden: Construction Started Without a License; Punishment Decided; Registration Certificate of Dahua Construction Factory Revoked

[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the previous Council decided to lease the Hardoon Garden on Weihaiwei Road as a park for this city, it has been discovered that the garden has started construction without a license. The Public Works Bureau has repeatedly ordered the work to stop, but the orders have not been followed. Later, it ordered the demolition of the new building. The owner of the site, Ma Tisen, went to the Public Works Bureau to apply for a license to avoid demolition when the house was nearly completed. He also claimed that the leased land was not within the scope of the Ai Li Garden. Now, the Bureau has sent personnel to investigate and found that the site was originally part of the Ai Li Garden. It was leased by Ma Tisen before the victory, and the garden walls were demolished to open the Li Yuan Hotel. The old site of Ai Li Lan is still clearly visible. According to his petition, the contractor of the illegal project, Dahua Construction Factory, has not registered with the Public Works Bureau. The Gu Runrunji Construction Factory, which is related to it, has been penalized by the Public Works Bureau with a one-month suspension of its construction registration certificate.

The Public Works Bureau believes that it will take time to rebuild the park, and it is proposed to change it to requisition and reserve it for three years for planning purposes. After discussion at yesterday's municipal government meeting, the following penalty measures were decided: "(1) According to Article 17 of the Building Law, a fine of 1% of the construction cost, or 570,000 yuan, will be imposed for illegal construction, and a temporary construction license will be obtained. (2) The person in charge of Hardoon Garden shall make a commitment to the Public Works Bureau that if the municipal government's plan to requisition the Ai Li Garden is finalized, the owner shall demolish all of the buildings without compensation within ten days after receiving the demolition notice from the Public Works Bureau, without being restricted by the original lease term.

### Opening Roads: Demolishing Houses; Compensation Fee Draft Approved by the Municipal Council Public Works Committee

In order to widen the road system in Shanghai and the existing small roads in the Chinese district, the Municipal Public Works Bureau's preliminary plan stipulates that all types of houses that have exceeded the safe age limit should be demolished. The first to be demolished are those exceeding the safe age limit on roads such as Jiujiang Road, Hankou Road, Tianjin Road, Ningbo Road, Jiangxi Road, Henan Road, Shandong Road, and Shanxi Road in the downtown area of ​​the Central District. As for the demolition of houses due to road construction, and the regulations for giving compensation fees, the calculation method has been drafted and submitted to the fourth meeting of the Municipal Council Public Works Committee yesterday for revision and approval, and sent to the Rules and Regulations Committee for review.

(A) The valuation of the house is calculated according to the original construction price assumed in the 26th year of the Republic of China, according to the cost of living index of workers in this city at the time of demolition. (B) The depreciation percentage is calculated according to the ratio of the safe age limit of the house to the years it has been built. The safe age limit of various houses will be determined separately. (Two) All demolished old materials will still be recovered by the owner. (3) For houses that have been demolished and have exceeded the safe age limit, the amount of compensation due for the last year of the safe age limit will be given.

### Social Affairs Bureau to Implement This Month: Registering Unemployed Workers; Providing Job Introductions Based on Their Skills and Aspirations

[Report from Our Newspaper] Li Jianhua, Deputy Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, told our reporter yesterday: The registration of unemployed workers will be implemented this month. After registration, job introductions will be provided based on their skills and aspirations. All preparations have been completed, and the forms have also been printed. The only difficulty is that the forms require photos, and the unemployed workers cannot afford to take them. From January to November this year, the Unemployed Workers Guidance Committee issued three batches of relief flour; the first batch benefited 71,500 people, the second batch benefited 78,439 people, and the third batch benefited 59,181 people. 2,461 unemployed workers who came to Shanghai from the rear were relieved by the committee, of which 1,805 lived in the committee's reception center. In addition, there were 111 unemployed overseas workers who returned to the country and were also among those who were relieved. In addition to the three batches of relief flour, the committee also has a batch of surplus flour, which will be used this winter to relieve the families of poor unemployed workers. As for the relief of unemployed workers this winter, Mr. Li believes that there are two ways: (1) Establish cooperative factories, which is being prepared. (2) Negotiate with the Public Utilities Bureau to implement work-for-relief, using unemployed workers to work on road repairs and other work. However, Mr. Li's personal opinion is that many of these unemployed workers are skilled workers, and some are from military factories. It is inevitable that they will not be used for their strengths if they are made to do rough work such as road repairs. As for the total number of unemployed workers in this city, Mr. Li previously estimated it to be around 60,000. After the police bureau investigated, it proved that this estimate was very accurate.

Later, seamen in the North China Tianjin area also united with each other, forming groups. However, due to personnel and regional relations, they mostly acted independently and failed to unify. After the 20th year of the Republic of China, the central government considered the shipping industry to be not only a national undertaking but also a foreign affair, and thus merged the various seamen's organizations in the past to establish the Chinese Seamen's Union, appointing Yang Xiaotian as a special envoy. Mr. Yang had a long-standing relationship with Chinese seamen and was a protagonist in the _______ peace talks, so seamen from the north and south deeply supported him without any objection. Not long after the union was established, the August 13th Incident occurred, and the union followed the war inland, from Shanghai to Hankou, from Hankou to Chongqing, and also established an office in Hong Kong. On the one hand, it actively expanded the shipping industry, and on the other hand, it assisted seamen in the occupied areas in carrying out anti-Japanese work. After eight years of hardship, it never slackened. After the victory, it actively prepared for repatriation. The order of repatriation was: (1) Those who followed the war inland and continued to engage in the shipping industry with meritorious service. (2) Those who followed the war inland and changed industries. (3) Those who resided in the occupied areas and did not work with the enemy puppets. (4) Those who were compelled by livelihood to supply the enemy puppets. Since the preparation for repatriation, many people have registered from various places. It is estimated that there will be representatives from 23 places in China and 13 places abroad attending this congress. The presidium of the congress will consist of seven people, with labor representatives occupying three seats. Labor representatives will also occupy two-thirds of the elected directors and supervisors. Individuals with a history of engaging in the shipping industry will be appointed. After the election of directors and supervisors, the county-appointed envoy system will be abolished, and the union will become a formal public association. The task from then on will be to closely contact all seamen, actively develop the shipping industry, _______, so as to meet the needs of the seamen's welfare undertaking, and strive to improve the status of Chinese seamen, so as to seek equality with the status of seamen from all countries in the world.

### Factories Disguised Selling at Lower Prices: Yarn Market Continues to Decline

Yesterday, the yarn market continued to decline. Yesterday was the deadline for factories producing reprocessed goods to pay for the allocated yarn.

### The Truth About the Insufficient Yarn Allocation for the Handkerchief Industry

Recently, cotton cloth prices have been slightly flat, but the cotton yarn situation is still tight. The other day (the 5th), the Bureau of Social Affairs summoned responsible persons from the cotton cloth industry to inquire about the actual situation of the cloth market. It was said that cloth prices have risen in the past ten days compared to before, but they have not exceeded the negotiated prices, and the fancy cloth is not even enough to cover the cost. It was said that the cloth opened by Textile Construction yesterday had no profit to be heard. According to news from the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association, the yarn allocation is indeed insufficient and the cloth price should be stable. It has notified all member factories to understand the current difficulties and jointly maintain the market. The Handkerchief Industry Association has long expressed dissatisfaction with the double discount of 60% on the yarn allocation and intends to petition for remedies. However, according to news from the Textile Management Committee and the Reprocessing Committee, when Mayor Wu decided on the quota in late October, the industry did not attend. The Textile Management Committee, based on the telephone report of its responsible person, allocated the quota by default, and this allocation was only in accordance with the uniform discount of 60% for each industry, but the number reported by the industry's telephone report was later known to have already been discounted by 60%, resulting in a double discount error. At the first yarn allocation in the fourth period, the person in charge of the Reprocessing Committee had proposed to first allocate a certain amount from the total to make up for the loss of this double discount, but the representative of the Handkerchief Industry Association said that each industry felt that it was insufficient and was unwilling to "cut flesh to mend sores", resulting in the launch of a petition. It is heard that the Reprocessing Committee is scheduled to convene a meeting today (the 7th) to resolve this dispute.

### Optimistic About the Future of China's Cotton Spinning Industry: One Million Newly Ordered Spindles Will Soon Arrive in China; Strong Domestic Demand and Weak Competitiveness of Japanese Yarn

[Our Newspaper News] A textile expert told this reporter that the spinning spindles ordered by China's textile industry in the United Kingdom and the United States are estimated to be more than one million spindles. Those who ordered them are all large-scale capital groups, such as the Bank of China system, the Bank of Communications system, and the Shenxin system. Most of the spindles are ordered in the United Kingdom, and a small portion in the United States; the reason is that the depreciation rate of British spindles is smaller and the use period is longer, while American spindles are too new. With China's current industrial environment, their use is not very suitable. At the same time, the British spinning machines used to supply the entire European continent, but now the European market has shrunk, so there is surplus capacity to supply China's needs. It is also learned that China placed orders very early, so if there are no unexpected reasons in the past six months, the new machines will be shipped to China one after another, and China's textile industry will have a new look. However, if the supply of raw cotton relies on American cotton, it will consume too much foreign exchange. National cotton, on the other hand, is small in quantity and difficult to concentrate due to military and transportation relations. At the same time, there are also quality problems, because after American cotton is transplanted to China, the cotton fibers become short due to geology and cultivation, which is most suitable for spinning coarse yarn of 20 to 32 counts, and fine yarn of 40 counts or more is not applicable. As for the overseas competition of China's cotton spinning industry, he believes that the number of spindles opened by Japan is no more than 2.5 million, and the products are also in high demand domestically. It is possible that the Japanese yarn previously reported to be transported to Hong Kong was the pre-war inventory. Moreover, the United States currently has 18 million yarn spindles, with extremely high production efficiency. Its cotton cloth is currently still supplying the domestic needs and has not been exported overseas in large quantities. It is predicted that when it exports in large quantities next year, it may cause pressure on the Chinese market.

### Customs Ordered to Continue Implementing Restrictions on Rice and Grain for Export and Transit: To be Lifted When the Situation Permits

For merchants to report rice and grain for export and transit from Shanghai Customs, they should submit two or more documents, such as invoices from rice merchants in the producing area or certificates from industry associations, as well as ship and railway transport documents. At the same time, they should also submit a certificate from the Ministry of Food. After verification by the Customs, they will be allowed to pass. The effective period of the above measures expired at the end of November. The Customs recently received an order from the Executive Yuan that the aforementioned measures restricting the reporting of rice and grain for export and transit from Shanghai should continue to be implemented and should be lifted when the situation permits. After receiving the order, the Customs has notified the implementation yesterday.

### Tunxi Newly Extracted Superior Grade: Tongfu Absorbed 28 Boxes

The foreign merchants' tea market, although there was some absorption of India and other places recently, it was difficult to fulfill due to the scarcity of ships. If the high _______ Chen Qimen, which is thinly stocked in the market, is bought by British export banks, there will be no success. As for green tea such as Chouzhen and Zhenmei, which are sold to Africa and Morocco, those with inferior quality are still difficult to sell. This year's new tea, however, has long been lonely in foreign sales due to the different domestic and foreign selling prices. Tea merchants in this city are still trying to remedy the situation. At present, Tongfu Foreign Company has absorbed 28 boxes of newly extracted precious grade from Tunxi Road, priced at 360,000 yuan per dan.

### Sericulture Crisis Serious; Raw Silk Guild Directors to Petition in Beijing

This year, the sericulture industry in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui is in extreme difficulty and cannot be sustained. The raw silk guilds of the three regions have submitted requests to the central government ministries for relief. Furthermore, the chairman of the guild, Chu Fucheng, and acting director Leng Di, taking advantage of their attendance at the National Assembly, first reported to the central authorities the current difficulties of the silk industry. According to news from the raw silk (three regions) guilds, they received a letter from Chu Fucheng in Beijing yesterday (the 5th). Chu reported the current situation of the industry in detail at the chairman's banquet for the National Assembly representatives. The chairman then instructed that concrete measures for silk and tea export relief would be announced in the coming year.

### Black Market for Rayon Surfaces Again; China Trust Requests Mayor to Crack Down

China Trust Bureau distributes rayon to manufacturers on a progressively increasing basis. The distribution procedure has been changed to distribute to the electrical machinery industry every Monday and to the weaving, knitting, and dyeing industries every Thursday, still distributing eight times per month. The first distribution for this month, originally scheduled for this Monday, was slightly delayed in application by various industries and was specially combined with the second distribution on the 5th. It is reported that 208 electrical machinery companies applied for 580 cases, including 518 cases of Takayama rayon, priced at 2.75 million yuan per case, and 62 cases of Toyo rayon, priced at 2.7 million yuan. The number of applicants and quantities requested by the weaving and knitting industries have been registered and sent to the bureau and will be distributed after verification. The next distribution should be soon. The dyeing and weaving industries have not yet applied. Hangzhou requested 400 cases for this month, which have already been shipped and entrusted to the Hangzhou branch for distribution. During the period of rayon shortage in this city, the black market price once exceeded 5 million yuan. Since the China Trust Bureau started distributing rayon in exchange for goods, the black market price has dropped to around 3 million yuan. However, recently the black market has become rampant again, with Jin San Ma rayon jumping to over 3.8 million yuan, and Xin Tian Qiao also above 3.4 million yuan. Furthermore, new goods such as Jin San Ma and Toyo rayon have appeared on the market, indicating that unscrupulous manufacturers are transferring the distributed goods to the black market for profit, which not only affects the market but also violates the bureau's distribution purpose. The bureau is a business organization and has no authority to crack down. Therefore, it has sent a letter to Mayor Wu requesting assistance in cracking down in order to maintain the market.

### Xin Da Silk Factory Liquidation

[Report from our newspaper] The silk weaving industry in this city has also been severely affected by the business depression. People in the industry have the agony of wanting to quit but being unable to do so. Under the current unfavorable conditions of high interest rates, expensive raw materials, high labor costs, and sluggish product market prices, it is impossible to avoid operating at a loss. However, on the other hand, the livelihoods of the workers must be maintained. It is reported that the liquidation of the Xin Da Silk Factory is just the beginning of the whole whirlpool. Regarding the silk weaving industry loans undertaken by the Bank of Communications and the Bank of China, the loans obtained by each factory were originally limited to purchasing raw materials and providing for production. However, it has been found that the factories that obtained the loans considered it more important to repay high-interest debts than to purchase raw materials for production. Therefore, most of them used the loans to offset old debts. It is reported that the Central Bank authorities are extremely dissatisfied with this. In addition to planning to recover the loans already issued, if the factories cannot provide concrete proof of purchasing raw materials in the future, no further loans will be granted.

### Japanese Trade Difficult to Restore; Foreign Trading Firms Closing Down One After Another

Therefore, foreign trading firms, except those engaged in specialized work necessary for the occupation forces, are announcing their closure one after another.

### Large Pieces of Dried Longan Flesh Turn Tight

### Knitting Industry in Dire Straits; More Than Ten Factories Announce Closure

More than ten first-class knitting factories, including Zhongguo, Taiji, Qinyi, Hua'an, Huafeng, Meiqi, and Zhongxing, have formally announced their closure due to poor business conditions and have requested the Social Affairs Bureau to dismiss their employees. It is said that the main blow to the business is the dumping of smuggled glass silk. Currently, a dozen pairs of glass silk stockings on the market sell for only 160,000 to 170,000 yuan, while the cost of a dozen pairs of domestically produced rayon stockings is 120,000 yuan, plus factory expenses, at least 150,000 yuan or more, and no one is buying them. The interior is also hopeless due to the impact of traffic wars. Currently, the knitting factories that are still operating are only working three hours a day, or three days on and two days off,勉強维持 in an effort to persuade employees to resign voluntarily and seek other employment in order to avoid huge dismissal expenses. Since the victory, most of the electrical machinery and knitting industries in this city have not resumed work.

However, depending on the education policy, it will consult with the Ministry of Education and ask the Executive Yuan to change the difference between 3350 and 2020 into a study abroad subsidy. (4) Retain the original service unit's salary. The Ministry of Education replied that there was no precedent for this and it would be inconvenient to handle. The Executive Yuan said that the above requests would be answered after the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Education jointly signed and considered them. The association believes that the results of the three representatives' trip to Beijing to petition have not been satisfactorily answered, and they will continue to appeal to all parties in order to achieve their goals and enable them to study abroad. The association also listed that the total value of imported goods from January to September of this year published by the Customs reached 997,587,169,000 national currency, which is converted into US dollars at an average of 2020 exchange rate of 493,855,000 US dollars. Compared with the total cost of 9,728,000 US dollars for the three-year study abroad expenses of the 1,216 self-funded students in this session, it is only 0.5%. The government should not begrudge this small amount of foreign exchange and hinder the path of aspiring students. The association has set up registration offices at No. 80 Aitang Road and No. 86 Tongfu Road to facilitate the registration of self-funded students from other places who come to Shanghai to join the association.

### City Elementary School Liaison Association to Hold Formal Delegate Meeting Tomorrow

According to Li Zhanren of the organization section, the newly elected representatives of the City Elementary School Liaison Association should be 317 people. 208 people have reported to the section. A first delegate meeting was held a few days ago, but it was changed to a discussion meeting because there were too few attendees and the quorum was not met. It is now learned that the association has scheduled a formal delegate meeting at 1:30 PM on the 8th (Sunday) at the Gangpo Road Primary School. At that time, in addition to appointing eleven chairmen, future association development matters will also be discussed.

### City Education Bureau Decides on Winter Vacation Dates

It has now been approved by the bureau affairs meeting that the winter vacation for all primary and secondary schools in this city will be from January 20th to February 10th, 1947, for a total of 21 days.

### University Football League Opens; Shanghai University vs. Fudan; 2:30 PM at Jiaotong University Stadium; Both Armies Preparing for Battle

[Report from our newspaper] The first football league of colleges and universities in this city is scheduled to open at 2:30 PM today at the Xujiahui Jiaotong University Stadium. Shanghai University and Fudan University will face off first. The referee is Chen Ling. If it rains, the football group will notify to stop the game. This is the first university football match in this city after the victory. The grand occasion of the East China Eight Universities Jiangnan University football match will be seen again today. There will also be cheerleaders cheering. There will be a grand occasion on Xuhui Road again. The lineups of both sides are recorded below:

Fudan:

Zhang Zhirong Zhou Tianrong

Liu Kaiguo Lin Liangqing Wang Hesheng

Huang Gangwei (Captain) Qian Changrong Qu Lin

Shen Sijie Huang Keou Xiang Ba Wang Dingqiu Ren Jiagui Qian Jiaju

Shanghai University:

Zhao Yaozhang Zhang Fuqi

Cao Xinshu Chen Gongyao Zhang Bingxin

Huang Tingfang Xia Haifen Yu Hongchang Chen Baogen Yao Longxiang

Tu Biyi Yang Yongfang Wu Jingjiang (Captain) Zheng Deyao Wang Jingwei

Shanghai University Front Line Fierce

The Shanghai University football team has already been selected and practices every day. They also discussed tactics yesterday afternoon. Zheng Deyao, the captain of the team, and Wu Jingren, the center forward, are veteran football players of the school and have a tacit understanding with the left wing Tu Biyi, advancing and retreating properly. The center defender Yu Hongchang is good at using his head, and the center forward Wu Jingren passes the ball to both sides. The left wing's flying legs Tu Biyi sweep it in front of the goal, which is especially clever. Then the hard-footed Zheng Deyao accurately shoots the ball. Even if it does not hit the goal, it is not far away. The team's defense is weaker, but the Zheng and Yu players can be transferred to respond to unexpected situations. The school has organized a 60-person cheerleading squad, which will cheer and shout at the time. Cheng Shide, the head of the school's general affairs office, is the commander-in-chief, and the morale of the entire army is extremely high, which will pose a major threat to Fudan.

Fudan Offense and Defense Are Excellent

The Fudan football team has a fairly neat lineup. The captain Qian Changrong and the defender Wang Hesheng are both pillars of the Shanghai Football Association's A-League team, so the strength of the defense is far better than that of Shanghai University. Qian Jiaju, Qu Lin, and Shen Sijie are known as the three flying legs, coupled with the stability of the center forward Wang Dingqiu and the skillful ball handling of the two inside wings. I am afraid that Shanghai University, which has extremely high morale, will be busy coping. However, the team should try to avoid single-handedly dribbling straight, and always consider the gaps on both wings, then it will undoubtedly be able to win.

### Shanghai Fish Cup Small Football Final Today; Jianfeng vs. Yumenfa; Referee Team vs. Old Man Team Performance

Civil Affairs Briefs

### Ministry of Interior Explains "Household Registration" Terminology - Municipal Government Has Already Issued Instructions to All District Offices

The Municipal Government approved a telegram from the Ministry of Interior, roughly stating: "The term 'household registration' in the current Household Registration Law refers to various registrations of 'nationality,' 'identity,' 'migration,' and 'floating population,' as well as registrations of 'changes,' 'corrections,' and 'cancellations.' However, in official documents from various departments, it is often mistakenly assumed that 'household registration' specifically refers to 'nationality registration,' or the terms 'household personnel registration' and 'change registration' are still used, leading to inconsistent terminology and misunderstandings. In the future, all departments should follow the regulations. When referring to all registrations, it should be called 'household registration.' When referring to a specific item, it should be separately called 'nationality registration,' 'identity registration,' 'migration registration,' 'floating population registration,' or 'establishment of household registration,' 'cancellation of household registration,' 'birth registration,' etc. After the first registration is completed, the continued handling of various registrations of 'nationality,' 'identity,' etc., should be called 'continued handling' or 'continued registration,' avoiding the use of the term 'change registration' to avoid confusion. Please investigate and instruct subordinates to take note." It is reported that the Municipal Government is instructing the police bureau and all district offices to take note.

### District Briefs

The District Office of the 21st District (Xinshi) of this city stipulates that each Bao and Bao Ding must go to the district to sign in once every three days, with ten times per month as the standard, and will be assessed separately at the end of each month.

The Fifth Bao of the Fourth District (Penglai) intends to create a 17th Jia for the Fifth Bao, as the number of newly built shantytowns within the jurisdiction of the 8th and 9th Jia of the Bao is increasing, and the number of households in the existing Jia is also too large. Jin Lizhong was selected to serve as the Jia Head of the Jia.

Zhang Xingliang, the Jia Head of the 28th Jia of the 40th Bao of the Third District (Yimiao), has requested to resign. It is proposed to appoint Zhang Yimin to fill the vacancy, and the district has submitted a request to the Municipal Government for approval.

The Cooperative of the Fifth District (Taishan) recently purchased a large number of towels and soaps and will soon begin distributing them to members.

### 14th District Holds Enlarged District Administration Meeting

The District Office of the 14th District (Zhabei) held an enlarged district administration meeting at the Koulun Road Rice Industry Association the day before yesterday. More than ten units, including the Zhabei Police Branch, the District People's Representative Assembly, the Rice Industry Association, and the District Party Department, attended. After District Chief Wang reported the purpose of the meeting as chairman, the discussion began. Decisions were made on various cases, including winter relief and the removal of barbed wire fences, and the meeting adjourned at around 5 pm.

### The Extravagant Feast at the Waldorf - A Sea of Tailcoats Everywhere - Diplomatic News - Skillful Use - Seemingly a Speaking Competition

— November 20th, New York Air Mail - Special Correspondent in the United States, Mao Shuqing, from New York

The early winter rains in Paris hastened the departure of the lively scene from the Luxembourg Palace. The Queen Elizabeth liner, which made its maiden voyage after the war, transported these figures who manipulate the fate of the world to this side of the Atlantic. The Waldorf Hotel next to New York's Park Avenue, which was not valued in the past, inherited the mantle of the Luxembourg Palace and became the center of world peace.

The flags of four countries are planted at the entrance of the Waldorf. The hotel is crowded with 'miscellaneous' travelers. The American official security work is done very discreetly. At the elevator entrance and in the bar, there are no 'Marines' standing full of guns and swords like at the United Nations venue. The Foreign Ministers' meeting itself is a 'closed-door' meeting, and the protection of these 'VIPs' by the secret police is mostly behind the scenes.

### Striving for Freedom of the Press - Protesting

The meeting is set in a reception room on the seventh floor. Except for the opening day, when reporters were allowed to take photos, they were never allowed to enter again. The four countries of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union each booked one or two rooms on the fifth floor as press rooms. Every day after the meeting, the press commissioners of the four countries reported on the day's meeting, and sometimes they could add a little description. For example, how Molotov lit a cigar, Bevin blushed during a certain speech, etc. Their reports were only limited to what was 'publishable,' which was of course discounted from the original. The American press commissioner initially prohibited reporters from non-American newspapers and news agencies from listening in. The British and French newspapers always maintained the principle of 'freedom of the press.'

Of course, many people expressed disappointment with the American approach. Some people protested to the State Department, and I was one of the first to protest. 'Public anger is hard to resist,' and it was eventually opened up.

### Everyone Wears Formal Attire - No Exceptions

Newspaper reporters are now not only 'honored guests' at the 'Waldorf,' but also once served as 'good hosts.' That was on the evening of the first European Armistice Day (November 11th), when the New York Press Association publicly banqueted the chief representatives of the five permanent members of the United Nations and the representatives of the Security Council. The Press Association notified its members two weeks in advance. The public banquet fee was stipulated to be US$10. Each member could bring family members, adding US$10 in total. Those who brought more than two guests had to pay an additional US$15 per person, and it was stated: "There are not many seats, so please reserve quickly." The notice also solemnly wrote: "This association has specially invited: Bevin, Gu Weijun, Bernas, Perotty (French Vice Minister), and United Nations General Assembly President Spaak (Belgium) to speak." Molotov only agreed to attend on the day of the public banquet, so a sentence was temporarily added to the program: "This association is deeply honored that His Excellency Molotov will also attend and speak."

Two days before the public banquet, I received another notice from the Press Association: 'Everyone should wear formal attire to the banquet.' This was a first for me. When I was in London, I also attended Prime Minister Attlee's banquet, and newspaper reporters did not wear formal attire. A colleague from the New York Times was very angry and cursed those 'guys' from the Press Association for being boring. He said, "It's not a funeral. We newspaper reporters can't stand this!"

### Restaurant Converted into a Dance Hall - Bevin Reminisces

However, the reporter gentlemen still obeyed the law. Under the silver lights, more than 500 people were all dressed in 'evening dress,' and the scene was very neat. Molotov, wearing luxurious formal attire, arrived earliest and shook hands with the reporters. Burns, Burns' wife, a typical noble old lady from the American South, was surrounded by 'hosts' asking questions. Foreign Minister Bevin arrived the latest. As soon as he saw the newspaper reporters, he spoke eloquently about his feelings. He said, "As soon as I entered the Waldorf Hotel, I thought of my childhood. Thirty-one years ago, at that time, I was younger than you are now, and I lived in this hotel." When walking from the reception hall on the third floor to the large restaurant on the 18th floor, Bevin couldn't help but exclaim: "I remember very clearly that I danced in this restaurant!"

He asked the person next to him: "This is a dance hall, why was it changed into a restaurant?" An American newspaper reporter told him: "Yes, it is still a dance hall. Today, because there are many people, tables have been temporarily arranged." Foreign Minister Bevin showed a naive smile. He believed that his memory was not bad!

### Mr. and Mrs. Guo Taiqi Appear at the Meeting

Our representative Guo Taiqi and his wife arrived very early. Mrs. Guo was wearing a Chinese cheongsam and shook hands sincerely with many American female reporters. Mrs. Gu Weijun did not attend the event due to a 'cold.' Ambassador Gu's demeanor was very appropriate and considerate. An American woman in her forties shook hands with Ambassador Gu to greet him. He only said two or three words of greeting. Afterwards, someone told Gu that she was a famous reporter from the New York Herald Tribune. Ambassador Gu seemed to take the opportunity to greet her and talked very sincerely for several minutes. The next day, the New York Times published the full text of the speeches of the three countries of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and lightly passed over the opinions of China and France in one sentence. The Herald Tribune had a more detailed record of Ambassador Gu's speech.

### New Posture in Diplomatic Circles - Speech Competition

Diplomatic skills are not simple, and the cooperation between diplomacy and news depends on good use. In front of fifty round tables and five hundred reporters, that day was actually a speech competition, although it was called a "public banquet." Inexperienced diplomats may 'faint' under the gaze of so many 'uncrowned kings.' The French 'Vice Minister,' although he did not attend, was already flustered enough. Spaak of Belgium, although he was not a representative of the country, showed everywhere that he was a 'veteran' among diplomats. His burly figure, clear and refreshing accent, humorous and relaxed content, and attitude of neither arrogance nor inferiority won warm applause. He spoke in French. Reporters who understood French laughed and cheered long ago. Those who did not understand French couldn't help but 'hold their stomachs' and exclaimed after it was translated into English.

### Bevin's Voice is Loud and Clear - Speaks with Great Weight

Bevin mentioned the relationship with newspaper reporters at the beginning. He said that he was the chairman of a London newspaper: the Daily Herald (note: the organ of the British Labour Party). He also said that he had been to the Waldorf thirty-one years ago, but the scene at that time was completely different from today. Then he talked about Britain's contribution to world peace. His voice was loud and clear, and every sentence had weight, like a politician's speech. Molotov still spoke in Russian. He began by saying: Today's speakers all speak in English or French. "Because my language talent is too poor, I have no choice but to use Russian." Then he returned to the topic. Americans all paid attention to this second figure of the red empire with curiosity and mystery.

### Bernas Speaks About the American Spirit - Fighting to Defend Justice, Righteousness, and Peace

Among the dozens of speeches I have heard Bernas give, none has been more successful than this one. Bernas always had a hoarse voice in his previous speeches, but this time it was clear and sweet. He was always 'too nervous' in the past, but this time he was 'calm and composed.' Not only were his tone and posture good, but the content was also good. First, Bernas is the mainstay of the current Democratic Party, and the Democratic Party completely failed in the congressional election. Many people are concerned about Bernas's future and the future of American foreign policy. Bernas gave an answer in his speech. Second, the Press Association publicly banqueted the chief representatives of the United Nations. The chief representative of the United States was not him, but Mr. Austin. He spoke very carefully in his speech. He emphasized the feelings of the first European Armistice Day and said that countless American athletes had "died on the battlefield" and bravely died twice in battle, and then said that the United States was determined to defend justice, righteousness, and world peace.

### Finally Reciting - A Letter from an American Mother

Every sentence of his was written in a literary style. Especially when he finally recited a 'Letter from an American Mother,' I saw many colleagues moved, and a few people had tears rolling in their eyes.

That letter was written by an American mother from Minnesota to an American bishop. The mother's son died in the Battle of Okinawa. The mother described how her son bravely joined the army and bravely died on the battlefield for a noble ideal of mankind. She described the last meeting with her child and the moment of farewell when the child left. Every sentence and every word was full of passion and tears.

Bernas's speech ended with this letter, adding a lot of aftertaste to many people.

### Gu Weijun Talks About Asia - Looking Forward to a New Life

Ambassador Gu Weijun was the second speaker (the first was Spaak). His clear English won a lot of appreciation from the audience. That day, Ambassador Gu especially emphasized the "new life" of Asia and the Far East. And these "new lives" were all inspired by China. The content was powerful and insightful. It is said that the speech was written by Principal Yang Yongqing and revised by Ambassador Gu. The next day, the New York Times wrote in the news column: "Dr. Gu Weijun's speech last night looked forward to a new Asia!" (At the New York Times Building)

### A New Experiment by the British Labour Party: Socialist Economic Policies in Progress

— London Airmail, November 21st, by our Correspondent in Britain, Zhu Zunzhi

Recently, the British Parliament reconvened, and the Labour government announced its policy guidelines for this parliamentary term. At that time, fifty-eight Labour MPs put forward an amendment criticizing Foreign Secretary Bevin's foreign policy as leaning to the right and being out of sync with the Labour Party's socialist policies. Since the Labour Party came to power, British domestic policy has been entirely on the socialist path. But what differentiates it from the past? What is the difference between so-called socialist economics and Soviet communism? These questions seem to have received little attention, and the British people seem indifferent.

A Major Blow to the Soviets, Also Greatly Influences the US

A common feature of British socialism and Soviet communist economic policies is planned economy, with "control" and "nationalization" visible everywhere. However, the biggest difference between the two is that the British Labour Party does not neglect individual freedom. Its goal is to have socialism and democracy go hand in hand. So-called socialism is not only an economic model, but also does not oppose the spirit of democracy in politics. If this system succeeds, it should be the most ideal political and economic system after the fall of capitalism, completely different from the Soviet economic system that disregards individual freedom. This may be the most envious point of the Soviet Union towards Britain, because although the Soviet Union has always opposed capitalism, its own system has too many shortcomings. The British Labour Party's approach can not only avoid the various drawbacks of the capitalist economy, but also, under the premise of maintaining the spirit of democracy, can diagnose and treat the socio-economic problems proposed by Marx and embark on the path of economic equality. The British Labour Party's economic policy is still in the experimental stage. Once it achieves success, it will naturally be a huge blow to the Soviet Union's "ideal," and it will also have a very profound impact on American capitalism, both superficially and substantially. The American labor organization is powerful. If there are signs of shaking in the American economic structure, the American labor organization is likely to follow the example of Britain and establish an American Labour Party. Such a third party, with the British precedent, is very likely to overthrow the Democratic and Republican parties and then enter the White House.

Five Years of Foundations Laid, the Conservative Party is Powerless to Deal With It

The biggest thing the British Labour Party has done in more than a year in power is to "nationalize" or "state-own" all important economic institutions, such as railways, highways, aviation, shipping, telecommunications, banks, and important industrial raw materials such as steel, iron, and coal mines. Currently, what has already been nationalized through Parliament includes the Bank of England and the national coal mines. What needs to be discussed after the opening of this parliament are transportation and the electrical industry. Also in the planning are the steel industry and the textile industry. British society, which has lived under a free economy for a long time, is of course not easy to adapt to this economic system where everything is state-owned, but after the Labour Party has decided on this policy, all proposals are easily passed in the parliament where the Labour Party has a majority. The reason why general voters elected the Labour Party in the British general election last July was mostly because they were tired of the Conservative Party and wanted to change the situation. Few people thought that if the Labour Party won in this election, it would be the beginning of a contest between British capitalism and socialism.

Labour Party Socialism is under a century-long plan, and five years is of course a very short time, making it difficult to achieve victory again in the next general election. Therefore, some people doubt whether we will still see the Conservative Party making a comeback in our lifetime.

The Nest of British Capitalism, Changing the System Is Not Easy

The Labour Party is naturally successful in promoting everything under these favorable conditions, but conservative British capitalists are sometimes unusually stubborn. For example, the nationalization of the steel industry cannot be carried out for the time being, because large capitalists have a lot of equity in steel, and the complexity of the problem is far greater than that of the coal mining industry. The fact that there is no case of steel industry nationalization on the parliamentary agenda is also a harbinger of the Labour Party's surrender to the Conservative Party. In fact, this kind of criticism is inevitably excessive. The change of the entire national economic system cannot be accomplished in one or two years, let alone the fact that Britain is the nest of capitalism! Recently, the British Fabian Society held its 50th anniversary celebration, and the Labour government gave it quite a boost, resulting in some ridicule. The Fabian Society is the pioneer of British socialism, but on the point of nationalization, it advocates starting with education rather than advocating radicalism. Therefore, the so-called progressive leftists ridiculed the government, believing that the government's nationalization policy was originally contrary to the Fabian Society's approach. Now, the government does not dare to take active policies for a while, but uses the Fabian Society to cover up its own incompetence!

Labour Party Social Insurance System, Established Very Well

The British social insurance system is the most perfect in the world, and the Labour Party has worked harder on social insurance since it came to power. The relevant bills passed by the parliament in the past year include the "National Insurance Act," the "Industrial Injury Insurance Act," and the "National Health Act," etc. In addition to the various facilities of social insurance in the past, now British people, whether it is childbirth, death, old age, disability, unemployment, retirement... all insurance is handled by the government. The risk of freezing and starvation can almost be said to have been reduced to a minimum. The so-called "from cradle to grave" insurance system has been very well established. This year, the government's expenditure on social insurance is a total of 450 million pounds, which will increase to 600 million pounds in 1948, accounting for 10% of national income. The British population is only 45 million to 48 million, so this amount is quite large. Britain is currently not far from the level of full employment. Even if male and female soldiers in the transition period are included, the number of unemployed people is less than 7% of the total population. This number can be reduced to 2% in the short term.

Increase in Export Trade, Headaches About Housing, Clothing and Food

As for British export trade, the Labour Party has adopted the traditional and consistent policy of increasing production and increasing exports, because the British Isles live by overseas trade, and without business, there is nothing. After the war, the goal of British export trade was to increase to 175% of that in 1938. As of the end of September this year, it had reached 104%. The biggest difficulty in Britain's economic recovery is the lack of power and raw materials, and the lack of coal is the fatal wound to Britain's foreign trade.

Housing, clothing, and food rationing are the two most troublesome issues for the government in post-war Britain. These two issues are directly related to people's daily lives. The people's reaction to the government's actions on clothing, food, and housing is fast, so it has become a psychological problem. In fact, these are all superficial difficulties, and they are problems that any post-war country will have.

Current Achievements Are Already Gratifying, and Future Fruits Will Be Greater

Democratic politics and a socialist economic system progressing simultaneously is a new experiment. In the world after World War II, only the British Labour Party government is carrying it out boldly, regardless of all difficulties, and Labour Party members are of course proud of it. However, in the international arena, although the Labour Party has its ideals, the steps it has taken are very cautious, because reality should not be ignored in international politics. Some Labour Party members do not seem to understand this very well, and thus the so-called "rebellion case" has occurred. The growth of a system is different from magic, and it takes time. The Labour Party's current achievements are already gratifying and commendable. When the socialist experiment inside Britain blooms and bears fruit in the future, its impact on the international arena will not be predictable by ordinary progressive internationalists.

### On the Subei Canal Line

— Zhenjiang, 2nd, by Pan Shenzhi

Gaoyou, Baoying, Huaian, and Huaiyin counties along the Subei Canal line were rich in civilian goods and resources before the war. During the War of Resistance, they suffered the ravages of the enemy and puppets. Since the victory, they have been occupied by the Communist army. Today, the houses are dilapidated, epidemics are rampant, floods are frequent, and wailing is heard everywhere. It is unbearable to describe. The author went to Huai for business and happened to meet Zheng Tonghe, director of the Suning Branch of the Executive Yuan, and Deputy Director Li Chongde, who went to inspect these places. I will record what I saw and heard to report the truth:

Disease and Flood

The percentage of houses destroyed in urban and rural areas of Gaoyou, Baoying, Huaian, and Huaiyin counties is 10% to 20%. Shaobo Town in Jiangdu has suffered more damage. Schools, hospitals, and public places in each county are mostly damaged. People's property losses are very heavy, and life is extremely difficult, especially in Huaiyin. On the west bank of the canal between Huaian and Huaiyin, the Communist army breached five openings. From Huaiyin to Baoying, the west bank of the river is a vast ocean, stretching for more than a hundred miles. In the western countryside of Gaoyou, floods have caused disaster, inundating a total of more than 2 million mu of land. There are 500,000 people in urgent need of relief, all lacking clothing and food and displaced, in a very miserable state. In the Huaian, Huaiyin, Lianshui, and Siyang areas, about 200,000 people suffer from kala-azar, and 20,000 people suffer from yaws, which are spreading rapidly and urgently need treatment. Most of the grain in each county was looted by the Communist army. According to local sources, the remaining grain is only enough for consumption this winter, and a grain shortage is inevitable in the spring. It is now the winter plowing season. Although some areas have already been sown, returning refugees and poor farmers still lack wheat seeds and plowing cattle and cannot sow. In the west bank of the river, the flood has not receded, and winter plowing is almost hopeless.

Dangerous Canal Banks

The Yellow River breach has not been blocked, and the Yellow River water and the Huai River water converge and flow from Hongze Lake through the Sanhe Dam into the Guangying, Gaoyou, and Shaobo lakes and reach the canal. The water is surging and has not receded. In previous years, the water level of the canal in winter was only about 11 to 12 feet, but now it is still above 15 feet. Between Shaobo and Gaobao, the canal and the lakes rely only on a line of western bank as a barrier. If the west bank is not protected, the lake water will pour out, and the east bank of the canal will be in danger of collapsing. If the east bank collapses, hundreds of miles of land from Lianghuai in the north to Shaobo in the south and to the Lixia River area in the east will become a swamp. Shaobo, Gaoyou, and Baoying will bear the brunt and suffer the most. Its danger is even greater than the seawall in southern Jiangsu. The east bank of the canal, from Shaobo to Huaiyin, is more than 150 kilometers long and is also the main line of the Yangqing Highway. The bank has been in disrepair for many years. There are already several dangerous sections in the Shaobo to Gaobao section. The bank outside the south gate of Gaoyou has also been seeping water. If it is not repaired in time, the danger can be predicted during the summer flooding season next year.

Director Zheng's Inspection

After the recovery of Huaiyin and Huaian, the Suning Branch of the Executive Yuan immediately sent personnel to Huaian to set up an office and transferred flour and old clothes from Xuzhou to be distributed selectively in the areas of Huaian, Huaiyin, Siyang, and Suqian that were severely affected by the disaster. When canal navigation was restored, another 300 tons of flour were transported by water from Zhenjiang to Huai for emergency relief. 150 tons of flour have also been allocated from the Gaobao area, and personnel have been sent to investigate and release it. The first phase of emergency relief has been completed. The branch's relief effort was rapid and simple, which was well received by the local community. The author witnessed the branch's investigators still working hard in the dim twilight in Gaoyou. In terms of epidemic prevention, the branch has invited Mr. Lawson, a foreign expert from UNRRA, and Miss Adam to Huai to organize a temporary epidemic prevention team and, together with the Jiangsu Provincial Health Department, sent staff to treat kala-azar and yaws. Prevention and treatment began on the 11th of last month in the Siyang and Huaiyin areas.

Zheng Tonghe, director of the Suning Branch, and Li Chongde, deputy director, departed from Zhenjiang on the 6th of last month to inspect the disaster-stricken areas, health institutions, elementary school buildings, warehouse management, and embankment projects in each county. After the inspection, Zheng decided: (1) to rush a large amount of flour and old clothes from Zhenjiang to the counties along the canal to provide emergency relief to disaster victims, and to telegraph the headquarters to allocate an additional 1,000 tons of relief flour to the Huai area to continue the second phase of emergency relief; (2) to discuss with the Canal Engineering Bureau the emergency repair of dangerous parts of the embankment, widen the bank, and plan to build concrete block stone projects at the dangerous sections. The five breaches between Huaian and Huaiyin have been temporarily closed, but the project is crude and may not last. A discussion with the Engineering Bureau was also conducted to reinforce and repair them; (3) to use work as relief to repair the health centers in the four counties of Huaihuai, Gaobao, and to allocate hospital beds and medical equipment. In Huaiyin, more than 230 boxes of medicines and equipment have been transported and are being distributed; (4) to assist the counties along the canal in repairing 20 elementary school buildings that have been destroyed; (5) to allocate 500 tons of flour to exchange for wheat seeds and distribute them to returning refugees and the poor for winter plowing; (6) to do our best to send refugees back to their hometowns so that they can live in peace and make a living.

In summary, the disaster area along the canal in northern Jiangsu is vast, the disaster is serious, and there are many disaster victims. Although the Suning Branch has organized emergency relief and work relief, it is only a temporary measure. It is hoped that government authorities and people from all walks of life will strive to fundamentally eliminate the disaster so that the people of northern Jiangsu can escape the water and fire and ascend to a comfortable life as soon as possible.

### On the Translation of Musical Terms: The Transliteration of Four Composers' Names

— Li Chi

Here, I would like to specifically mention several composers' names mentioned by Mr. Zhu et al. as examples of my previous article.

1.  The Transliteration of Dvořák

First, let me state my opinion: I agree with Mr. Joseph Zhang and Mr. Ning's assertion that the initial "D" should not be dropped or untranslated. However, since Mr. Zhu transliterates it as "Fu Xia Ke," the consonant at the beginning of the second syllable is clearly much closer to being translated as "l." Here, let me digress a bit:

One or two years before the Pacific War, in short, it was D.'s "anniversary," I stayed in Hong Kong and happened to be proofreading a concert program for a friend, so I ran into a first-class English printing house. A foreigner was also proofreading "clean copies" next to me, but he had a lot of typos. I was surprised; "clean copies" rarely had typos in the past. I stretched my neck and took a look. I first saw that it was not English, nor French, German, Russian, Italian, or Spanish. Looking closely, I found many Dvorak words. I curiously asked him: "Is that Czech?" The foreigner seemed a little annoyed and only said: "How can you say that the text is Czech?" A moment later, he said to himself: "All the hats are not worn!" I understood that he was saying that the symbols above the two letters in D.'s name were not typeset, which made him angry. From this, I believe that Mr. Zhang and Mr. Ning are right that the diaeresis on the "r" and the accent mark on the "a" are indeed indispensable.

Then, I learned from the printing house that the "Free Czech Association" staying in Hong Kong was preparing to hold a commemorative concert on the evening of D.'s "anniversary." I did not give up the opportunity, and that night I unexpectedly heard a surprisingly rich program of all D.'s works. Someone gave a speech at the meeting. Judging from common sense, he was very likely D.'s "fellow countryman." I heard very clearly that he mentioned D.'s name several times, pronouncing the initial "D" very heavily, without dropping it.

Then, what is the pronunciation of the consonant in the second syllable, the "r" with a "hat"? In my memory, it is not the English "rolled r," but the "fricative" or "burst-fricative with plosive" between the tip of the tongue and the upper palate. It is slightly similar to but actually different from English sh, zh, tsh, dzh. Later, I finally found its "phonetic value" in a phonetics book written by a Japanese, but unfortunately the book is not at hand, and I dare not say it randomly now, but I remember that there are no ready-made and appropriate relative phonetic values in Japanese, English, and Chinese. Based on the results I heard above, I dare not use it as the criterion for the final decision.

(2) Schubert and Mozart

I would also like to put forward the transliteration of the names of Schubert and Mozart mentioned by Mr. Zhu to serve as examples of "language changing with emotion."

I remember that not long after Japan and Nazi Germany formed an alliance, Hitler sent Mr. Kempf to Tokyo as a "music festival envoy." Objectively speaking, Mr. K.'s "bloodline" and musical cultivation can be considered unquestionable. I have heard his performances and lectures. When he read the manuscript in front of the microphone with a standard accent, he pronounced the "t" at the end of each of the two names S and M very clearly. Moreover, the second consonant from the end of S's name, "r," was also unexpectedly emphasized. At that time, I believed that some people in Germany also read it like this. Mr. Kai translated it as "Schubert" without dropping the "er" sound.

Also in those one or two years, I watched two sound films with S.'s biography as the subject, one German film and one French film. In these two films, I heard many pronunciations of his name very clearly. The simplest is to pronounce the syllable "—bert" at the end as (—bet), that is, the most ambiguous "e" in the center of the tongue, and the "t" below is so weak that it is almost inaudible. This is almost the same as the pronunciation we usually hear when foreigners casually talk. However, there was a scene in the film where S. was so poor that he pawned his beloved instrument. After he left, the old clerk called his name loudly, and the "r" and "t" at the end of his name were pronounced very clearly.

These two examples may help us whether we can accept Mr. Zhu's proposal to translate it as "Mo Zha" and omit the "r" and "t" at the end. I think that even if someone omits it in conversation (the tongue trying every possible way to be lazy is also one of the phonetic phenomena), but since the standard and emphatic pronunciation is still preserved, then the Chinese transliteration should adopt the latter.

However, according to what I have heard people pronounce S's or M's name, no matter how simplified it is, it will not be like Mr. Zhu said that only a "Y" rhyme is left at the very end of M's name, and it becomes a so-called "open rhyme" without a consonant. Some people pronounce M's name as (rnotzart) or (rnouzart). A simpler way is to shorten the "rhyme" at the end to (—aat) or (—at) or even (—atr). As for saying (—a) without a consonant ending, it is the first time I have heard it from Mr. Zhu. It is worth noting that (—atr) means that after the mouth finishes saying (—a—), the tip of the tongue pushes up to the front teeth behind to complete the preparation for making the consonant "t," but at this time, all the vocal organs are completely relaxed, the vocal cords stop vibrating, there is no aspiration, no burst, and the tip of the tongue is also lowered. There is no such "stoppage" with a consonant in Beijing language. As far as I know, the "entering tone" characters in Cantonese often have this (—ati), such as the Cantonese pronunciation of "cha" in "friction." Mr. Zhu thinks that it is correct to translate M's name as "Mo Zha" in the northern language. I am afraid that the root lies here. However, this kind of slight reading is clearly not enough for transliteration. Furthermore, when calling someone's name orally, how can you save only one or two consonants? It is said that in the meeting of the three giants, Roosevelt initially called "Joseph Stalin" in full. Later, when they became familiar, it was only shortened to one syllable "Joe," which is quite like us calling "Old Li" or "Old Zhu." I think that if someone named "Mo" and named "Cha (Zha) Te" was born in China, his friends would undoubtedly call him "Old Mo." But when signing the treaty, it is still "Joseph Stalin"; when applying for an ID card and registering, it is still said "Mo Cha (Zha) Te"!

It is a fact that foreigners' pronunciation of people's names cannot be as uniform as in the dictionary. Also, the "spelling" of foreigners writing the names of foreigners from that country is not completely uniform. There are four or five different ways to write the name of Russian "Tchaikovsky" in German and English. If the writing is different, the chance of pronunciation differences is naturally greater. The Chinese transliteration of "Gorky" is wrong, and the British should bear half the responsibility.

3.  The Transliteration of Beethoven

The transliteration of B's name can be used as a concrete example of the "original sound" issue mentioned in the fifth paragraph above. B can be said to be one of the most familiar to people in China, but the transliteration of the name is also the most uneven.

I have found in books that there are at least two ways to read his name. One is that the British and Americans are accustomed to reading "th" as a "t" or the dental tip sound "th," and transliterations such as "Bei Duo Fen" and "Bei Duo Wen" come from this. However, the Germans more commonly put the "t" in the first syllable, leaving only the soft palate guttural sound "h" in the second syllable. Mr. Wang Guangqi, who first introduced B's name to China more than 20 years ago and eventually died in front of the Berlin Library, translated it as "Bai Di Huo Fen." These four Chinese characters may be a bit ugly, but "sound for sound," Mr. Wang's transliteration represents many Germanic people, that is, the second reading.

4.  Final "Redundant Words"

It can be roughly seen from the above how difficult the compilation of the transliteration of people's names is, but this is only four people. If you squeeze many people's names together again, there is naturally a more basic question: Is our ideal to try to find the most accurate one individually, or to first consider the minimum but average accuracy of the whole, and would rather sacrifice the most accurate one individually?

Finally, I would like to put forward a few "redundant words": In the above, I have not yet considered the "voiceless" and "voiced" of all consonants, such as p and b, t and d, etc., and how to match "ㄅ" and "ㄆ", "ㄊ" and "ㄉ" in Beijing language. Because this principle is not only limited to the transliteration of music terms.

### Bullfighting

— Guo Ya

Guo Ya (Goya 1746-1828) was an outstanding talent in 18th century Spain. He had a great influence on 19th century French painting. His style is bold and profound. He especially likes to paint bullfighting. This work can be called a representative work. (Lion)

### Fire

— Written by Su. Korolenko, Translated by Li Qiliu

How long it is! The dark autumn night. Suddenly I felt that I was floating on the sinister river of shadow. At this time, in the deep part of the river, on my rhyme surface, there was a shining fire.

It shone brilliantly and powerfully, very close to me………

"Ah! Thank God—I said happily—tonight's lodging has arrived………".

I shook the oars and looked at the fire again, but pressed the oars down forcefully again.

"Still far away!"

I did not examine how the fire was shining; it was appearing on the extremely dark side. The oars have been picked up, obviously, the journey is still far away!

This night fire, how bright, overcoming the darkness—is slowly approaching, shining, greeting its relatives. It seems that there are only two or three oars away—to reach the destination. But, the distance in between—is far away!

The river is like ink, endless darkness, I still floated on this dark river for a long time. Canyons and cliffs stand on both banks of the river. Behind, what is left and lost seems to be endless prospects. But, the fire is shining completely in front—it is so close and so far………

Now I recall the dark river shaded by canyons and cliffs, and the living fire. In the past, in the future, the relatives who are called are not just me. However, the warmth of life needs to pass through the shadowy river bank, but, the fire is still far away. It is time to shake the oars again…………

In the end, in the end, it is in front—fire.

### Bismarck's Love Letters

— Tian Xing

German Chancellor Bismarck, the advocate of "blood and iron," was an outstanding figure of modern times. In the Esperanto publication "La Verda Revuo," I came across a love letter he wrote to Miss von Puttkamer, filled with such tender affection that it read like a beautiful prose poem. I have translated it specifically for you. The love letter is divided into two sections, and the following is the main text:

(I)

I am waiting for the dawn to write to you, my sweet heart! You are like a small green alcohol lamp, bringing light and boiling my cold water. ... This morning, I have had a wonderful time; the most fitting thing to do is to write you a lovely letter. After completing these tasks, I have decided to spend this entire evening thinking of you; my beloved, to pass it in joyful and pleasant intimate conversation. As I write this letter, it is as if we are sitting on the sofa in that green reception room, and you are paying close attention to my wishes with great sympathy. This mail coach, for my pleasure, has brought me your letter just as I was free. ... How fortunate! You can never imagine how sad and painful my heart was when I returned from my travels and re-entered my house in the past, gloomy as if entering an ice cellar... Alas, God! And now? From my perspective, everything is different, because of you. My heart is always close to you, or rather, it belongs entirely to you. ... My life, viewed as a whole, is a new phenomenon. Now, even when doing defense matters and political work, I am happy and interested. This change, this new life, although due to God's grace, must be attributed to you, my admired and lovely Miss von Puttkamer—you, you have warmed my heart, not like the flickering flame of alcohol, but burning within me a warm, still fire. (February 1, 1847)

(II)

Why is your letter so sad? In that letter, I can find no words that say you do not love me, nor can I imagine words that express more love for me. If it were not for me, perhaps you would be thinking of the future and creating a state of mind that oppresses you in some way, a state of mind that troubles and depresses you. Who is more willing than I to share your sorrows, bear your pain, and take responsibility for your mistakes? ... My dear Rongna, must I repeat it to you again? I love you dearly; needless to say, we should share both good fortune and misfortune—I will bear your sufferings, and you will bear mine; and we will each receive our share of comfort. You can pour out your heart to me whenever you wish, and I will give you mine; our hearts and blood will flow together. I should and want to bear your worries, your sorrows, and your regrets—if you have any—and love you as you love me—not in the way you should love me or can manage to love me. (February 21)

### An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 115

— Ye Jingfeng

About ten feet away from the entrance of the flower lattice gate, there were several brocade square cushions on the ground. Upon reaching this point, the two women following Tsurumi hurriedly bent over and rushed forward, then crawled on the ground again, extending their snow-white hands from their sleeves to tidy up the central brocade cushion. In reality, the cushions were already placed neatly; their tidying up was to signal to Tsurumi, "Your Excellency can stop here; this is your seat."

As soon as Tsurumi stopped, the two women, bending at the waist, moved as if rolling and crawling, rushing quickly towards the closing gate at the head. When they walked, their feet were always bent, and since they were moving quickly while bending over, the large bundle on their backs, though covered by a light gauze dress, was affected by the unbalanced walking posture, so you could only see the peak on their backs bobbing up and down, rising and falling, in a very unartistic manner.

Tsurumi had arrived before this once-powerful and influential minister, but since the two had not yet greeted each other, he could not squat down immediately; he had to stand there for the time being. He saw the two women, upon reaching within a step or two of the low bed, suddenly crawl onto the ground and kowtow repeatedly, murmuring in low voices, probably reporting Tsurumi's arrival. The man lying on the low bed, who had been motionless, feigning a "spring nap in a thatched cottage," stiffly frozen, seemed to start up like a robot after the two women recited their report. Though he still did not move, one could hear him first drawing a full breath from his dan tian, lifting it straight up, and pushing it to his nasal cavity with a "humph!" sound, as if someone had punched him hard in the chest, making that humming sound. Immediately afterward, his eyes still on the book and his body still motionless, he began to recite the book in a tone like that of an old Taoist priest performing a ritual, chanting "Hurry, hurry, as the law decrees!" The sound was high, in the proper court key:

"Hong kong jiao, shou ji jiao da jiao li? Kuan, jiao ti jiao, yi si lu gui jiao, fan jiao qin tuo tang qi, wa..."

As soon as his machine-like message started and he began to recite loudly, nothing else mattered; it was only poor Tsurumi standing stiffly on the spot. Although it was amusing to watch, it was also somewhat overwhelming, like the Shanghai dialect's "chi fei xiao" (can't take it). You must know that he hadn't rested properly for fifty or sixty hours; although Elder Aoki had helped him activate his latent spirit, how long could he maintain it like this? According to Tsurumi, who carefully noted the time, the man lay on the bed, maintaining that ancient posture without the slightest change, chanting "jiao ji jiao" for at least half an hour or more.

As for the two women crawling on the ground, they probably had some experience, so as soon as the man made a sound, knowing it would not end soon, they simply relaxed their limbs and lay lazily on the ground to rest, like snakes sunning themselves. The two geisha-like female musicians, however, did not relax; instead, they braced themselves and, like movie dubbers, coordinated with the high and low, fast and slow, rising and falling tones of the chanting, using their pipa and zither to accompany it. They raised their tones with the high parts, lowered them with the low parts, and added interjections, interludes, and fillers, creating atmosphere, etc., trying their best to make the chanting sound colorful and vivid.

This important Japanese figure, who at the time held the power to decide life and death for the entire nation, could also be said to have initiated the slaughter in this Eastern Hemisphere since launching the "Greater East Asia" war of aggression. And from his collusion with international demons, having established the "Seven Secret Weaves" in preparation for disrupting the world's public law and the existing order of human morality, this fellow can simply be said to be one of the evil stars destroying the entire world. At this late hour, facing Tsurumi, who held a small position (from this fellow's position, Tsurumi was just a small special agent), why was he putting on this set of neurotic "twelve o'clock" games?

### The Glass Merchant

— Shao Fu

Amid the hawker turmoil, those who were beaten, injured, detained, suffered losses, attacked, or reprimanded are too numerous to mention. The mayor and reporters are all in a chaotic mess. Unexpectedly, this tense and confusing scene created an opportunity for glass merchants to make a fortune, truly "when a person is destined to get rich, even ghosts will lead the way"!

If you don't believe me, look at the facts:

First, according to Kwok Lam-sheung, manager of Wing On Company, speaking to reporters: After the disturbances, the price of glass in the city soared, doubling in the past two days.

Second, according to Tsai Chang, manager of Sincere Company: The 34 pieces of glass destroyed at the company were valued at 30 million yuan the day before yesterday (referring to the 2nd), according to an estimate from Tsai Heng Mao Glass Company, but yesterday (referring to the 3rd) the price had risen to 80 million yuan.

Doubling in two days, aside from selling human meat buns, there is nothing in the world more bloody and profitable than this.

Operating in the glass business naturally requires one to be shrewd. Opportunities like this for large-scale glass demand in Shanghai probably only happen once every ten years. If you don't take advantage of this price increase, are you afraid the money will burn your hands?

A friend jokingly said that under these circumstances, the thugs in the turmoil might be hired by the glass companies.

Another friend jokingly said that next time there is a similar event, I will definitely suggest to the thugs: Please specifically target glass companies and glass shops to show off your skills!

Mr. Mayor, what are your insightful views on this extraneous development of the hawker incident? Do you not think this is a form of irony? (I dare not say it is "profiteering from disaster.")

### The Capital Relocation Debate

— Xiao Kangshi

A heated debate arose over "setting the capital" while discussing the "Constitution," with "Nanjing" and "Beiping" becoming the focal points of the dispute.

Those advocating for "setting the capital in Beiping" were representatives from North, Northwest, and Northeast China, but most representatives outside these northern regions opposed "relocating the capital to Beiping." Reflecting on the conclusion of this debate, it seems that everyone was somewhat close to "prejudice"? Both sides inevitably exhibited "proximity to the capital" and "exploiting local advantages," creating a suspicion of "selfish views"!

However, from a rational perspective, let us first analyze the principle of "relocating the capital to remedy the current decline" as advocated by the northern representatives. In light of the times, we feel it is not "the most pressing task"! To "remedy the decline"? We should first emphasize the exertion of "human power" as the vanguard. If we base the decision to relocate the capital on historical advantages in transportation, economy, culture, national defense, and geographical advantages, then we must understand that today's rapid scientific advancements can overcome everything! If one relies on the aforementioned advantages while "sticking to old ways," "holding positions without performing duties," and "not seeking improvement," then no matter how "complete" the relocated capital may be, it will be in vain.

Secondly, if the capital were to be relocated, expenses would naturally come first. Recalling the expenses of returning to the capital after the victory, how much money was spent? The complications in transportation and personnel caused great effort and lasted for months, all of which were felt to be extremely difficult! Not long ago, the past is like yesterday, and is the current national treasury "abundant" or "deficit"? In today's circumstances, where the rulers and the ruled are in distress and the people are suffering, where can we bear this heavy burden? There is no clumsier thing than "exhausting the people and wasting resources," "wasting time and abandoning work"!

Based on the above reasons, under the current circumstances, relocating the capital would have "a hundred disadvantages and not a single advantage," truly a "superfluous act"! Instead, efforts should be focused on "construction," "spiritual unity," "utilizing talent to the fullest," and "utilizing the land to the fullest," which are the only conditions for "remedying the current decline"!

In the past, when Emperor Shun was a potter and general goods merchant, as long as he lived in a place for a year, that place could be transformed from barren land into a village; after living there for two years, the village would become as large as a prefecture; and after living there for three years, it would become a bustling commercial port. This was because Shun was able to "manage diligently." Therefore, from this perspective, we feel that the location of the capital should not be based on advantages as the main theme. Moreover, how can we be certain that the capital can be "remedied" after relocation? We dare not say for sure! Especially in an era of rapid scientific progress, "human effort can overcome nature," so why is it necessary to have this "Nanjing" and "Beiping" dispute?

"Clang!" It bumped into the toe of a friend beside me, but his toe saved it, only causing a little scratch on its forehead. Suddenly, I squatted down again to pick it up; I wanted it to rush towards destruction again.

But my friend blocked my hand, smiling as he told me, "The rice bowl itself is not at fault." As a result, it was saved again.

One day, one month, one year… it still accompanied me through life's journey, one stage after another. Time and frost had long etched cracks onto it, just as wrinkles had been added to my face. As I lamented my own life, I also thought, "It is also aging!"

My friend told me again, "Be careful, my friend, now just a slight tremor will destroy it."

"The rice bowl itself is not at fault" echoed in my mind. I began to feel attached to it.

"Clang," the sound gave me a shiver of foreboding.

I turned on the light to see that it had already fallen from the table to the ground, breaking into a not-so-complete lotus flower. It had found rest, eternal rest.

A "squeak" sound came from under the bed. Looking closely, I saw a mouse hiding in the wall hole, proudly laughing.

I bent down, picked up a piece from its remains, and examined it carefully. One or two grains of rice, still clinging to it from careless washing, were attached to it. "So it was these two grains of rice that attracted the mouse's covetous gaze," I suddenly realized?

Rice bowl and night, rice grains and mouse… a series of images swirled in my mind. I lay down on the bed, imagining a tomorrow without a rice bowl.

### Rice Bowl

— Xue Zhen

Rice bowl, the companion of my life.

One day, I picked it up, clenched my fist, and wanted to smash it with my fist. Obviously, I already hated and even loathed it; but in the end, I didn't smash it. I realized that although it was hateful, it was still needed.

Another day, I picked it up trembling. I smiled menacingly, turned my head, and threw it away with all my might. I was determined to break away from it, even to destroy it.

### Identifying the Body

— Ge Chunliang

Please Point Out the Contradiction

"I know the body has been soaking in the water for several days. Right?" said Port Detective Lang Sheng. At this time, he was accompanying Professor Huo Danai in a car to the morgue, where they were preparing for someone to identify the body.

"We found him in a very calm ditch," Lang Sheng continued, "Ah, his death was terribly gruesome. He was lying face down in the ditch, the back of his head shattered, covered in blood. His clothes were very wet and had already faded in color, undoubtedly due to being submerged for a long time. And his face! Ah, he had been in the water for at least four days. Based on the description of his appearance, I can confirm that it is the Bai Dewan they are looking for, although I could not find any papers or business cards on him as evidence."

Professor Huo Danai looked at the detective with a questioning gaze. At that time, the car had arrived at the entrance of the morgue. So he said nothing; when they arrived there, they saw the tearful Mrs. Bai Dewan and her brother waiting in the office. After exchanging a few words, they followed the coroner, the professor, and the port detective into the cold hall. There, on a stone slab, was displayed a gray-green, swollen corpse.

Mrs. Bai Dewan gritted her teeth, took a look, and shouted, "That is not my husband!" Then she fainted. Her brother also affirmed his sister's statement. That person was definitely not Bai Dewan.

"In such a case, mistaken identification is bound to happen. Lang Sheng, I find your opinion not only suspicious but also strange and laughable," Professor Huo Danai continued, "A very contradictory fact has already revealed your mistake, which you should have known long ago!"

Please tell us! Smart readers, what does the professor mean? The answer will be revealed tomorrow.

### Beware of the Appendix

— Zhong

Hong Kong is China's appendix, be careful, prevent "appendicitis," very important, very important!

### Just So-So

— Zhong Yi

Students from Shanxi are now launching a campaign to drive out Yan Xishan, attacking the old man Yan "completely," seemingly a large-scale movement. In the end, I dare to guarantee without a doubt that there will be no problem. Didn't Anhui Province also stage this act last year? And Li Pinsan is still "sitting firmly in power."

### Aborted Ending

— Zhong

A few months ago, in the capital, a court official was arrested for drug use. Knowing the law and breaking it is doubly guilty, but the ending is unknown.

### Winter Scene

— Tian

A wanderer, wrapped in straw and rags, shivers under the corner of a wall. A mangy dog beside him also huddles into a ball. Passersby all say that these are two pitiful animals without any difference?

### Two Kinds of Profit

— Zili Sheng

Student: "Teacher, how many kinds of profit are there?"

Teacher: "There are two kinds, one is legal profit, and the other is patriotic profit. The benefit that a merchant obtains in accordance with the law is legal profit. Buying from foreigners and selling to foreigners, what you earn is patriotic profit, for example, woolen blankets."

Wool Comes From the Sheep

It is said that the "translation breeze" (dubbing) of movie theaters will also be taxed. It seems that the authorities are making every effort to "leave no stone unturned" in opening up financial resources and enriching tax revenue. According to the Finance Bureau, the city's financial revenue is increasing every month "due to the continuous soaring of prices." Last month, it exceeded 8 billion in October and reached over 10 billion. This is certainly good news for the development of the city's future. However, what we worry about is that the increase in tax revenue is probably an alarm for rising prices. How sensitive are merchants? To cope with heavy taxes, they must plan ways to compensate, and as a result, the burden is still placed on consumers with fixed incomes. After consumers' purchasing power weakens, stores, under the dual pressure of heavy taxes and high-interest loans, will also quickly declare their inability to support themselves. The closure of the Gao Shiman Shopping Center, which had just opened for over a month, is one example. In these precarious times, the death knell has already rung. We cannot help but express some fear and anxiety regarding the increased tax revenue gained "due to the continuous soaring of prices" and the taxation of the "translation breeze"!

"Corruption Formula" One

Nameth, a Hungarian acting inspector of the Jianghai Customs Police, was arrested and brought to the court for trial on corruption charges. During the trial, we can analyze his criminal facts as follows:

Time: During the months of April, May, June.

Method: Through 24 instances of underreporting fines.

Amount: Embezzled 245,000 yuan.

Motive: To treat his teeth, unable to afford it.

Defense: Driven by the pressure of life, out of desperation.

This analysis can be called the "Corruption Formula." It seems that most current corruption, regardless of East or West, Chinese or foreign, adopts this formula. For example, wasn't the embezzlement case of Wu Suiren, the chief of the cashier section of the Executive Yuan, last month also an exception? It's just that the amounts differ slightly.

Breaking Officialdom Conventions

Director Ouyang of the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office took office at the beginning of the month and "did not hold a ceremony, which is a departure from officialdom conventions," according to reports. It can be seen that having a ceremony for taking office has become a norm in officialdom. By extension, one cannot speak without using "official jargon," nor can one write anything without a bit of "official investigation." Officials are the parents of the people, so of course, they must be different from the people. Initially, when Liu Bang saw the First Emperor's tour, with escorts like clouds, he had the heart to "take his place." Zheng Banqiao, occupying a seventh-rank position, could never climb higher. Seeing the pomp and circumstance of the governor's proclamation, he indulged in sensual pleasures and did not seek advancement. Therefore, if "official air" is too strong, it will have negative consequences, either making people too passive or too active. The way to moderation is to reduce the "official flavor" and interact with the people seamlessly. Director Ouyang is pioneering a new trend, a virtuous official governing the people, perhaps close to the ideal?
