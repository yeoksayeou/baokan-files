### Supporting Domestic Production Industries: Implementing a Strict Import Permit System - Executive Yuan Announces 18 Articles of Measures

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] The provisional measures for import and export trade and appendices, promulgated by the Executive Yuan in March of this year, have now been revised by the Executive Yuan and submitted to the National Government on the 17th for approval as instructed.

[This Newspaper's Dispatch] In order to adjust foreign trade policy and complete the domestic economic construction, the government specially announced the revised provisional measures for import and export trade, consisting of 18 articles, on the 17th, to be implemented immediately. According to these revised measures, the export of all goods, except for nine major categories of prohibited exports, is permitted freely. The import of all goods, except for forty major categories of prohibited imports, shall require an import permit before being allowed entry. In other words, the government will henceforth implement a comprehensive import permit system for foreign trade. At the same time, in order to implement this system and coordinate the work of relevant institutions, a Provisional Import Control Committee will be established under the Supreme Economic Council, with an Executive Committee set up within it to implement the formulated policies. (The revised provisional measures for import and export trade and appendices will be detailed in this newspaper's seventh edition.)

Premier of the Executive Yuan, Song, specially addressed this matter at 4:00 PM on the 17th at the Executive Yuan, hosting a press conference to deliver the following remarks:

Since the end of the war last autumn, the most urgent task for our country's reconstruction is to obtain materials to replenish the shortages of the past eight years. A large quantity of imported goods has already arrived to meet this need, in addition to materials transported by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) and surplus materials from Pacific islands agreed upon with the United States for transfer. Therefore, the government is confident in ensuring an adequate supply of materials, and the issue of material supply can be considered resolved satisfactorily.

This situation enables the government to focus all its efforts on construction. Now that the time is ripe, the government should immediately implement a method of selectively permitting imports under its general economic policies, expanding the application of the import permit system from the provisional measures for import and export trade promulgated on March 1st of this year to all imported goods.

All imported goods will be classified according to their nature. Essential goods and raw materials needed by domestic production industries, as well as other materials with legitimate uses, will be given priority for import. Furthermore, the transport of various equipment will be facilitated. However, the import of non-essential goods will not be encouraged.

These revised provisional measures for import and export trade were submitted, approved, and promulgated for implementation today, and are sufficient to support domestic production industries and promote economic construction. Although a temporary measure, it is an extremely important step in our country's economic construction process.

Sun Baogang and Others Will Fly to Beiping Today to Visit Zhang Dongsun for Consultation

[This Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] The issue of the Democratic Socialist Party's participation in the National Assembly may soon be realized. After arriving in the capital on the 16th, Zhang Junmai, Xu Chuanlin, Sun Baogang, Jiang Yuntian, and others submitted four opinions to the government: (1) Resolve the Communist Party issue politically; (2) Party groups should withdraw from schools; (3) The constitutional draft submitted to the National Assembly should be based on the revised draft of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC), hoping to guarantee its passage; (4) Guarantee the people's four major freedoms.

[This Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] Jiang Yuntian visited Lei Zhen at the Council of State Affairs at 11:30 AM on the 17th and talked for a while. Lei then visited Zhang Junmai. Afterwards, Lei told people that the Democratic Socialist Party was discussing internally the issue of participating in the National Assembly.

If the people can obtain political democracy, the Democratic Socialist Party will not insist on details.

[This Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] Zhang Junmai talked on the morning of the 17th: "As long as the government implements democracy, we can help at any time." Regarding the nomination list, the party plans to send Central Committee members Sun Baogang and party member Ye Duyi to fly to Beiping on the 18th to consult with Zhang Dongsun and others.

### Democratic League Attitude Active

[This Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] The attitude of the Democratic League has become more active again due to the arrival of Zhang Junmai and others in the capital. Luo Longji visited Zhang Junmai at 10:30 AM on the 17th. It is said that apart from a portion of the Democratic League insisting on following the Communist Party, the rest believe that they should decide on their own independent position at present.

[French News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] Democratic League spokesman Luo Longji said on the 17th that the Democratic League will refuse to accept the seats left to them by the reorganized National Government Committee, as the Democratic League feels that this step will not help with the unification and peace of the country, just as the Democratic League's participation in the National Assembly will not help with unification. Mediation activities have been suspended due to the convening of the National Assembly, but I have formally notified the government that I will stay in the capital or near Shanghai so that I can make efforts to mediate again when the opportunity arises. As for the negotiations between the government and the Democratic Socialist Party to request the party to participate in the National Assembly, the details are still unknown. If the party breaks away from the Democratic League and participates in the National Assembly, it will not have a significant impact on the strength of the Democratic League, as the Democratic League only has 20 Democratic Socialist Party members. However, if it is consistent with the Democratic League, it will in principle obtain 40 seats in the National Assembly, which is the number of seats that the government requires it to split with the Democratic League to give it.

### Striving for Construction After Destruction - Chahar in New Life - Restoring Electricity is the Current Urgent Task

[This Newspaper's Beiping Dispatch, 17th] A reporter went to Chahar for the second time and returned from Zhangjiakou on the 16th. Seeing Chahar Province striving for construction from destruction, (1) The Zhangjiakou Railway Bureau has repaired eight broken locomotives and six train cars in one month. The affiliated machinery factory has been restored, and the monthly repair of three locomotives and thirty passenger and freight cars. More than 500 of the more than 700 workers have returned to the factory to work. Under the leadership of the old locomotive section chief, who is 70 years old, the work enthusiasm is very good. (2) Administrative Department: The administrative meeting of the 12th War Area has gradually transferred government affairs, and the provincial government, which is gradually taking shape, and the provincial cadre training class will start on the 20th. The county magistrates appointed by former Chairman Feng, except for Huailai and Zhuoxian, have mostly not taken office. It is said that the commander has appointed others to take charge. The repatriation teams have all been disbanded, and retaliation is strictly prohibited. In addition to handling the land issue in accordance with the measures announced by the central government, further measures to adapt to the local conditions have not yet been formulated, but the principle has been decided. Except for those higher than the "two-five" rent reduction, which are reduced to the "two-five" standard, those that have been set lower than the "two-five" standard according to custom are not allowed to increase. Before the spring ploughing next year, it must be completely decided to replace the Zhen with work, and the 9,000 workers who are engaged in cleaning up the ruined factories and repairing the roads are given 3,000 to 4,000 legal tender per person per day. (3) Economic Department: The main power source of Chahar Province, the Xiahuayuan Power Plant, originally had 64,000 kilowatts of power generation equipment. The remaining machines can be pieced together to form a power generation machine of 10,000 kilowatts. The Resources Committee has checked it out. It can be repaired in two months. Zhangjiakou is currently repairing a generator that can supply 1,000 candles and an electric mill. Merchants and civilians cannot use it yet. After the automatic telephone was destroyed, there are currently more than 200 manual machines for military and government use, which can soon be increased to nearly a thousand, and a portion will be distributed to merchants and civilians. The cigarette factory, which originally produced hundreds of boxes a day, can use most of the machines, but it cannot start work due to lack of electricity. The same is true for other factories, so restoring electricity is the current urgent task. General commerce has become more prosperous due to the gradual increase in population, but the silver roots are still tight. There are about 3 billion legal tender circulating in the market, so prices have not risen much, increasing by one-tenth or two-tenths compared to when it was recovered. There is only one silver bank (there were more than 20 when the Chinese Communist Party was in power, all of which had Chinese Communist Party shares). The Central Bank has not yet opened. The main source of coal is the privately-owned Shixing Coal Mine in Xiahuayuan (the Chinese Communist Party once invested a quarter of the shares), which currently produces 200 tons of coal per day (it originally produced 1,000 tons of coal). In addition, there is the Pangjia Small Mine, which produces 30 to 40 tons per day. If industrial electricity has not been restored, it can still cope. (4) Cultural and Educational Department: There are more than 30 schools that have opened in the province. One middle school and one normal school can be restored recently. There is no hope for the restoration of schools above the vocational level. Middle and elementary school textbooks have been transported from Beiping. The operators are China and Commerce. In addition, a cultural relics preservation committee has been formed, and a folk education hall and library will be established. The middle school advanced class that moved from Nankou to Zhangjiakou will be expanded to accommodate 500 people.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 17th] The disaster situation is serious throughout Chahar Province. Bai Shijin, director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Provincial Government, came to Beiping from Zhangjiakou on the 16th and is scheduled to fly to the capital on the morning of the 17th to ask the central government for instructions on handling emergency relief and requesting exemption from next year's field tax.

### Completion of the Sino-American Agricultural Mission; Full Report to be Published; American Team Members Leave Shanghai for Home

[Nanjing, Central News Agency, 16th] The Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Team has now completed its mission. After paying respects to Chairman Chiang and visiting relevant ministries and commissions, the American team members have departed for Shanghai and are returning to the United States. The American team members arrived in Shanghai on June 27th, joined their Chinese counterparts, and immediately began work. They spent four weeks in Nanjing and Shanghai, after which they divided into smaller groups to inspect the actual conditions of major agricultural areas. The trip lasted a total of eleven weeks, covering fifteen provinces. They completed their field work on the 6th of last month and returned to Nanjing to begin drafting a report. The report, which is over forty pages long, was jointly discussed and prepared by the Chinese and American members of the team over a period of six weeks. It has been submitted to the governments of China and the United States for reference and to our government for adoption. It will be jointly published by the two governments at a later date.

American Team Leader's Remarks

The American team leader, Mr. Hutchison, stated that a sound agricultural plan is of utmost importance to China's prosperity. Whatever directly affects agriculture and the 300 million farmers indirectly affects the happiness of the entire nation. Agriculture is not only essential for the people's food, clothing, housing, and transportation, but also an important raw material for industry and a major source of foreign exchange. Before the war, the value of China's agricultural exports accounted for 70% of the total export value, which is clear evidence. This foreign exchange can be used by the Chinese government to purchase industrial machinery, transportation equipment, and special materials necessary for industrial development. If China can apply the latest scientific methods to improve soil, crops, livestock, and agricultural implements, it will certainly increase agricultural production and farmers' welfare. He also firmly believes that improving the tenancy system, agricultural loans, and the marketing of agricultural products in China can also improve the economic situation of farmers. Mr. Hutchison said: "Our country has made a good foundation in the improvement of plant seeds in the past ten years, but there is no foundation in the animal aspect. The food of the Chinese people should not only be sufficient in quantity but also emphasize quality. Vegetables, fruits, and meat are just as important as rice and wheat." Mr. Hutchison hopes that China can establish two or three well-equipped agricultural research institutes. China lacks agricultural technicians. Relying solely on hiring foreign experts and sending domestic agricultural students to study abroad is not the only solution. Because graduate students in agricultural science from Chinese universities are still doing research when they go abroad, but if there is a complete agricultural research institute in China, and they understand the domestic situation and are familiar with the environment, what they gain will definitely be greater than being in a different environment and unsuitable for the national conditions of their own country.

Key Recommendations

The team, deeply aware of the difficult environment faced by Chinese farmers, has prepared a report with sound plans and reasonable organizations to solve these problems and has submitted it to the governments of China and the United States for adoption and implementation. The recommendations are summarized as follows: (1) For the linkage of national agricultural education, research, and extension, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Ministry of Education should cooperate effectively. All experimental stations under the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in the capital and the agricultural colleges, agricultural experiment stations, and agricultural extension bureaus in the nine central regions of the country should be closely linked. The provinces should expand their businesses at all levels of agricultural institutions and strengthen their work. (2) For the widespread supply of low-interest agricultural loans, the improvement of agricultural product marketing, the improvement of tenancy systems in some areas, the implementation of land surveying, registration, and valuation, the Land Law promulgated by the National Government this year should be strictly enforced. (3) Establish a national agricultural bank to coordinate national agricultural finance to meet agricultural needs. (4) Establish an agricultural control bureau in the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to handle plant and animal quarantine, grading and inspection of superior products, and suppression of adulteration. (5) China's limited agricultural resources cannot supply the current pressure of increasing population. This difficulty will be difficult to solve even with future agricultural and industrial development. The government should seek countermeasures to solve the problem early. (6) Special attention should be paid to the construction of chemical fertilizer plants, the development of farmland water conservancy, the improvement of crop and livestock breeds, the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests, the cultivation and protection of forests, the increase in poultry and livestock production, agricultural intelligence reports, and price surveys. (7) For major export agricultural products that have stopped exporting due to the impact of exchange rates, rising domestic transportation costs, and increased interest rates, effective countermeasures should be taken quickly to encourage their export. The completion of the above recommendations cannot be achieved overnight, but the team believes that all talents should be fully utilized and strive to achieve them as soon as possible. To implement the above recommendations, agricultural construction funds must be greatly increased. The team believes that this increase is necessary to improve the welfare of the Chinese people and increase national financial revenue, and the government should not be stingy.

### Active Construction of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway; Unimpeded Traffic Between Haiphong and Lao Cai

[Kunming, This Newspaper, 17th] The Yunnan Branch of the Import and Export Trade Association previously telegraphed the Ministry of Communications to quickly repair the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to facilitate the future. Currently, the railway between Haiphong and Lao Cai is unimpeded, while the traffic between Hekou and Lao Cai is still pending. It is reported that the steel rails required for the repair of the road are about 180 kilometers in total and can be transported into the country for paving the Jianbish railway in the short term. The Ministry of Communications has agreed to allocate 20 million yuan per month for subsidies. The gentry and people of Mengzi, Jijiu, Jianshui, and Shiping, through which it passes, have suggested to the government to change the paving to a one-foot-wide track to connect with Bisezhai on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. In this way, one-third of the Shifo Road has been completed, which will greatly benefit the economic construction of southern Yunnan.

### Ninety-Three Japanese War Criminals in Changchun to be Sent to the Shenyang Northeast Headquarters for Trial; Hoping that Compatriots who Suffered Will Come to Testify Quickly

[Changchun, Central News Agency, 17th] The reporting work of Japanese occupation criminals in Changchun has come to an end due to the end of the repatriation of Japanese expatriates. Changchun was the political center of the former Puppet Manchukuo, and most of the major war criminals were in Changchun. However, because the war criminal investigation agency was established too late, in addition to some reported by the Soviet army when they were in Changchun, most of the remaining war criminals were mixed into the Japanese expatriates and repatriated. Although a war crime investigation committee was set up in the former Japanese expatriate management office, its work did not achieve significant results, and the number of reported persons was small. By September 24, when the war criminal investigation committee was ordered to be established, most of the Japanese expatriates had been repatriated. As of now, a total of 93 suspected Japanese war criminals have been reported in the city. Except for a very small number reported by the Chinese, the rest are arrested because their positions are suspected of being war criminals. Regarding their crimes, either no one reported them, or because their addresses are now occupied by the Communist army, the investigation is extremely difficult. It is reported that the war criminal investigation committee has been ordered by the Thai Ministry of National Defense to be sent to the military court of the Northeast Headquarters in Panyang for trial recently. It is deeply hoped that compatriots who have been harmed by them will come to testify quickly or submit evidence in writing to avoid letting them escape the law again due to insufficient evidence.

It is also reported that several military judges will be sent to Japan next spring.

### Baoyun Temple Murder Case; Local Court Opened Trial Yesterday; Two Prisoners Admit to Poisoning

[Beiping, United Press, 17th] The case of the abbot and incense partners of the ancient capital's famous Baoyun Temple being burned to death was opened in the local court today. Two main culprits, Taoist priests from the temple, confessed to poisoning. Six others also confessed to participating in the murder, while the remaining twenty-seven said they were forced by the main culprits. The two main culprits claimed that they had obtained the consent of each other Taoist priest to murder the abbot. The president of the Beiping Taoist Association issued a statement saying that if the abbot and incense partners had violated the rules, they could be expelled. The main culprit had previously filed a lawsuit against the abbot and incense partners, but the result was a loss. This murder may have been a private act of revenge.

### Editorial: Revision of Import and Export Trade Measures

The proposal to revise customs tariffs has long been called for by the industrial and commercial sectors. The main points of the appeal, apart from the exemption of export taxes, can be roughly divided into three areas: (1) increasing the tax rates on some imported goods, (2) restricting or prohibiting unnecessary imported goods, and (3) encouraging and facilitating much-needed imported goods such as machinery and transportation.

The so-called revision of import and export trade measures was indeed announced yesterday. This revision has not yet involved the tax rate portion, and the first point mentioned above still requires continued efforts. However, in terms of the points already revised, their importance cannot be underestimated. It can be said to be an epoch-making reform in China's foreign trade and tariff history. A summary is provided below:

(1) General Control: Under past measures, some goods could be freely imported and foreign exchange could be freely applied for. As a result, foreign goods flooded the market, resulting in a large trade deficit and a significant threat to national industries. Furthermore, it wasted foreign exchange funds, making it difficult to maintain a balanced exchange rate. The new measures stipulate that the import permit system will be extended to all imported goods. The purpose is naturally to correct the above-mentioned shortcomings and provide considerable protection to domestic industries in a precarious situation. This measure will undoubtedly win widespread sympathy.

(2) Prohibition of Unnecessary Goods: According to Schedule (3) B of the Interim Measures for the Revision of Import and Export Trade, this schedule includes goods not listed in Schedules (1), (2), (3) A, and (4), and their import will be temporarily suspended until further notice. Schedule (4), which prohibits the import of goods, includes as many as 37 tariff categories. All consumer goods, toys, ornaments, cosmetics, valuables, luxury goods, and other similar items are clearly prohibited from being imported. This is a significant improvement over the past method of relying solely on prohibitive tariffs and using heavy taxes as barriers. This measure is also in complete agreement with the expectations of the general public.

(3) Implementation of Quota System: The quota system is implemented concurrently with the prohibition of imports. That is, the quantity of goods permitted for import will also be subject to considerable restrictions. If this measure can be properly implemented, on the one hand, it can alleviate the large trade deficit, and on the other hand, the actual domestic needs will not be greatly hindered. We believe that this is also a very reasonable approach. The fact that importers are limited to those who have already registered and been approved by the Interim Import Management Committee, and that the distribution quotas are negotiated by the importers themselves, will inevitably present some difficulties during implementation. However, this is a procedural issue, and these difficulties should not be difficult to overcome.

(4) Goods for Priority Import: Essential goods and raw materials required by domestic production enterprises, as well as other materials with legitimate uses, will be allowed to be imported with priority. Furthermore, the import of various machinery and equipment will be facilitated. These are all goals that everyone has longed for. However, strictly speaking, these are still principles, not concrete measures. The so-called essential, legitimate, and facilitated aspects should be taken into consideration everywhere when implementing these principles in the future, and they should not be distorted.

(5) Equal Treatment for Government and Private Sectors: Article 13 of the revised measures stipulates that the procedures for applying for import permits for goods imported by industrial and commercial institutions or companies operated or managed by the government are the same as those for private enterprises. Our opinion on this article is the same as the above. That is, in the future implementation, we must take this principle into consideration everywhere, and it must not be distorted. In particular, the application procedures for import permits for goods needed for public purposes or by government agencies themselves will be handled entirely by the Executive Yuan. Furthermore, the Interim Import Management Committee can also issue general permits, including not only relief and rehabilitation materials, US surplus materials, and lend-lease materials, but also goods purchased by the government using foreign loans. If these goods are not entirely for public purposes or needed by government agencies themselves, it is hoped that private enterprises will also be considered, so that they have equal opportunities for allocation.

According to the authorities, all imported goods must be licensed, and US dollars will no longer be available for use, so a black market will not occur. We certainly hold the same view. However, in addition to formally imported goods, there are also a large number of smuggled goods flooding the market. These goods are not declared to customs or settled for foreign exchange at all. After import restrictions are implemented, the supply becomes less and the prices become more expensive, which means that the profits from smuggling become higher. Therefore, if strict measures are not taken to completely eliminate the smuggling route, will the black market for US dollars eventually be eliminated? This still seems to be a question. It is hoped that customs and related agencies will jointly assume this responsibility.

### News in Brief

### General Review of Exemption and Deferment of Military Service in Hangzhou: Many Applicants, Insufficient Reasons; Chairman of Jiaxing Military Service Symposium Asks for Relaxation of Physical Examination

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 17th] The review of exemption and deferment of military service for able-bodied men in Hangzhou has been largely completed and submitted to the Municipal Government, which is scheduled to conduct a general review at the Municipal Government on the morning of the 18th. It is reported that there are many applicants for exemption and deferment of military service, but most of them have insufficient reasons, and it is feared that only two or three out of ten will be approved.

[Our Jiaxing Dispatch] Xia Jiping, Commander of the Northern Zhejiang Military Region, after inspecting military administration in the county on the 14th, invited the heads of various agencies and organizations to hold a military service symposium at the county government on the 15th. Commander Xia instructed on the following points: (1) Conscription should still be the main method of recruiting soldiers, supplemented by recruitment, except for volunteers. (2) Volunteers should be based on their native place, native village, and native guarantee as a principle. (3) Volunteers should be subjected to physical examination before being sent to the county. (4) Prevent forced conscription, fraud, and buying and selling of positions. If there is any malpractice, it should be reported as much as possible. (5) To change the people's fear of joining the army, more publicity should be given. After Commander Xia gave his instructions, Chairman Zhang of the County Council offered the following opinions: (1) If people from other provinces have canceled their household registration in other provinces, the military department should be asked to pay attention and correct them to their native place. (2) New recruits come from rural areas. Their usual nutrition is inevitably insufficient, so please relax the physical examination slightly. Then, the heads of various agencies offered their opinions, and Xia made a supplementary report before the meeting adjourned.

[Our Wuxi Dispatch] This county was ordered to implement temporary conscription. The county government has previously instructed various districts, townships, and towns to follow and collect recruits. However, various townships and towns have some difficulties in handling the matter because it is a new undertaking. In order to encourage able-bodied men to actively enlist, some have allocated living and resettlement expenses for the families of able-bodied men. There is nothing illegal in this, but the collection of these expenses should be made public, and the income and expenditure accounts should be submitted to the township and town mayors' conference for review after the event. There should be no embezzlement or private allocation in the name of conscription. Special orders are given to comply with this.

[Our Jiangyin Dispatch] It is reported that the deputy mayor of Fengheng Township in this county was bribed to release able-bodied men. It is reported that Zhu Yaozhong of the 5th Bao paid 30,000 yuan, Shen Chulang of the 9th Bao paid 30,000 yuan, Zhu Peisheng of the 3rd Bao paid 50,000 yuan, and Mao Sanbao of the 8th Bao paid 100,000 yuan.

### Military Grain to Be Collected by Deadline: Director of Zhejiang Grain Department Goes to Beijing for Instructions; Jiangsu Province Dispatches Personnel to Reside in Various Counties to Supervise Collection in Kind

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch] The central government yesterday telegraphed Zhejiang Province to collect the required military grain in full by the end of December. Chen Zhao, Director of the Grain Department, after receiving the telegram, decided to go to Beijing to meet with the Minister of Grain to report on the current grain administration situation in the province and to ask for instructions on business matters. Before leaving, he told reporters the following points: (1) The number of military grains to be collected is quite large. Except for a part to be supplied locally, the rest will be transported out. (2) Since the collection began in various places, it has been far from ideal. Currently, only Jinhua, Sheng County, and Changhua counties have collected more than 50%. (3) The supervisory committee members of various districts departed on the 1st. (4) Regarding the matter of allocating flour and grain with the Executive Yuan, the province has no grain available for allocation other than the military grain to be collected, so it must also ask the Grain Department for instructions.

[Our Jiaxing Dispatch] The County Grain Department, in view of the urgency of military grain, dispatched personnel to various districts and townships to supervise collection yesterday. The supervisors are Zhu Dianfei for Xinfeng and Wangjiangjing districts, Qian Chunpei for Fengqiao district, Zheng Yongkang for Xinqiao district, Shen Chunying for Wangdian district, and Chen Weiting for the urban district. The required amount for each district is also allocated in proportion to the original tax amount of each township and town. Xinfeng district is 6,500 dan, Fengqiao district is 4,700 dan, Xinqiao district is 4,800 dan, the urban district is 5,900 dan, Wangjiangjing district is 3,100 dan, and Wangdian district is 4,900 dan, totaling 30,000 dan, which must be collected before the end of November to provide military grain.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch] The Jiangsu Provincial Grain Department, in order to strengthen the efficiency of collection and sale and to supervise closely, has specially appointed supervisors to reside in various counties. The supervisors in each area are as follows: Suzhou, Liu Disheng; Wuxi, Wang Shaozeng; Wujiang, Su Kuibing; Wujin, Yu Yueqiu; Yixing, Tang Qixian; Songjiang, Yang Jiayou; Danyang, Tu Zhongqi; Changshu, Zhang Chenglun; Kunshan, Jiang Zengduan; Qingpu, Zhang Yan; Jiangyin, Chen Xuecai.

[Our Suzhou Dispatch] Although the actual collection of field tax in this county has been fully launched, few people have gone to the counter to pay. During the period of restoration and pacification, not only is the supply of military grain urgent, but also the central, provincial, and county finances have been exhausted. All depend on the income from field tax to supplement them. After investigation by local experienced experts, the reason is that the collection is not vigorous enough. The county government of this county issued another notice on the 15th to the district chiefs and deputy directors of the township offices of the Field Grain Office, instructing them to take into account the current difficulties, not to resign from complaints, and to go to various townships and towns immediately to supervise the township and baojia chiefs to step up the collection. At the same time, they should do their best to publicize, so that every household knows it, and strive to pay first, so that the number can be cleared before the deadline of December 15 to meet the needs.

[Our Wujin Dispatch] Regarding the actual collection of field tax in Muxian, the County Grain Department previously stipulated that the second and ninth districts should start collection first, and ordered the office to collect and deliver as it goes. It is now known that the ninth district has delivered 900 dan, which have been transported to the city one after another. Various households have complied with the order to pay, and the results are very good. All other districts, except for the sixth and seventh districts due to special circumstances, will start full collection on the 15th.

### Anhui Province Actively Repairing Highways: Old Trucks Carry Passengers, Extremely Crowded

[Our Hefei Dispatch] The pre-war highways in Anhui Province were more than 5,000 kilometers long. After the Anti-Japanese War, they were almost completely destroyed due to military impact. Last year, after the victory, under the principle of "Transportation First," the original highways were rush-repaired. To date, the highways that have been repaired and opened to traffic include (1) Hefei-Lihuang Road, 242 kilometers long. (2) Hefei-Anqing Road, 185 kilometers long. (3) Hefei-Bengbu Road, 158 kilometers long. The section from Hefei to Shuijiahu borrows the original roadbed of the Huainan Coal Mine. (4) Hefei-Yuxi Road, 125 kilometers long, completely borrows the roadbed of the Huainan Coal Mine. (5) Liuan-Yeji Road, 70 kilometers long. (6) Anqing-Taozhen Road, 46 kilometers long. (7) Anqing-Tangkou Road, 214 kilometers long. (8) Wuhu-Congshanguan Road, 197 kilometers long. (9) Qimen-Zhangwangmiao Road, 46 kilometers long. (10) Dafu-Heilingnan Road, 44 kilometers long.

### Rampant Banditry in Jiangxi Province: Robberies of Boats and Vehicles, Brutal Murders of Passengers; Joint Defense by Various Counties to Strengthen Security

[Special Dispatch from Nanchang] Jiangxi is currently experiencing a most serious phenomenon: the decline of all industries, widespread unemployment, and rampant robbery. There is a sense of a proliferation of bandits, making every step feel like walking through thorns. However, none of the robbery cases have been solved. This is because the perpetrators are destitute, temporarily band together to take risks, and scatter immediately after dividing the loot, each seeking their own livelihood. There are no fixed, long-term bandits, so it's impossible to track them down.

Continuous Robberies

The Gan River is the only major artery in Jiangxi and the central hub for shipping. While there have been occasional robberies of civilian boats, they usually occurred in areas difficult for the military and police to patrol. However, on the 10th of this month, at Sanjiadian, 35 miles from the provincial capital, two boats belonging to the Fulian Weiji Company, one upstream and one downstream, were simultaneously robbed. This was similar to the robbery of nine civilian boats a week earlier. Around 1:00 PM on the 10th, the "Fuyuan" ferry, en route from the provincial capital to Ji'an, reached Sanjiadian when suddenly a command to inspect came from the shore, followed by rapid gunfire and flying bullets. Forced to stop, more than 20 bandits armed with short guns and knives swarmed aboard in four small boats. They arbitrarily searched and robbed, emptying all cash and valuables. Then they boarded their boats and went ashore. It was later learned that the purser on the ferry lost 6 million in cash, and the losses of passengers were incalculable. After the robbery, as the ferry steamed away, its sister ship, the "Xinyunsheng," arrived from Ji'an. The same group of bandits fired at it, forcing it to dock and board for a thorough search. One passenger, identifying himself as a soldier, shouted, "Comrades, don't harm people!" The bandits immediately shot him, saying, "You can't control this!" Fortunately, the shot missed. Another bandit fired a bullet that hit him in the abdomen, causing profuse bleeding. Two other bandits dragged him out, threw him into the water, and fired another shot, sinking the body immediately. The robbery lasted three hours before they disappeared with shouts. The losses on that ferry amounted to at least tens of millions. After the incident, the company reported it to the military and police, requesting an investigation and arrest.

The Nanxun Road is the gateway from Jiangxi to the Yangtze River. However, there were three vehicle robberies in two days. Earlier this month, a vehicle from the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and a merchant vehicle were robbed by armed bandits a few kilometers from each side of Zhanggongdu. Three days later, passenger vehicle No. 31902 of the China Trading Company, en route from the provincial capital to Xunyang, was near Gutang, outside Jiujiang, when gunfire erupted near dusk. Several bullets struck the vehicle, forcing it to stop. A girl surnamed Qi among the passengers was struck by a bullet that entered from the base of her right ear, causing serious injury. Another youth was shot through his right arm, both bleeding profusely and in a terrible state. Seven or eight bandits carrying guns boarded the vehicle, searched and robbed for half an hour, then fled into the mountains with 50 million in loot.

Road and River Protection

With such a fierce robbery trend, coupled with rising prices and increasingly difficult living conditions, things are bound to escalate as the weather gets colder and the year ends. The Provincial Security Headquarters, taking the frequent robbery cases very seriously with the winter defense implementation imminent, has not only dispatched armed troops to protect roads and waterways but has also ordered all counties to implement joint defense and patrol, repair existing bunkers, recruit scattered soldiers and vagrants, and strictly inspect firearms for prevention. As for the bandits flowing in the Gan-Yue (Guangdong)-Xiang (Hunan) border, the Gan-Zhe (Zhejiang)-Min (Fujian) border, and the Gan-Zhe-Wan (Anhui) border, they will be cleared by the military in coordination with local militias. Scattered bandits will be the responsibility of local militias. From December to February of next year, during the winter defense period, all military and police in various regions must closely protect the locality and maintain security in accordance with the winter defense plan.

### Entire Group of Baolizhang (chiefs) Accuse Zhenzhang (head) of Beiku of Extortion

### Simultaneous Dredging of the Three Major Ponds in Haining Commences

### Zhejiang Province Land Registration Consolidation Plan to be Completed within Three Years

[Our Newspaper Hangzhou News] Regarding the land registration consolidation work in Zhejiang Province, the land administration authorities have now formulated a plan, ordering all counties and cities to complete it within three years. The main points of the land registration consolidation plan are as follows:

(1) Complete the consolidation of land registration throughout the Province within three years, starting with flat land and then moving to mountainous land. All procedures will be carried out in accordance with Central Government laws and regulations. All counties that have already issued land maps and certificates will convert to land registration. Those that have already conducted land survey and registration should continue to do so. Those that have not conducted surveys will start in the 36th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1947].

(2) Although the Central Government has allocated some funds for land registration consolidation in recent years, the amount is very small and insufficient. The expenses of each county rely on the revenue from registration certificates and village materials. It is now planned to recommend to the Central Government to increase the standard of certificate fees and to collect fees from landowners for materials and surveying. Before land registration is completed, landowners will be allowed to borrow in advance or obtain loans from banks to finance the work.

(3) In addition to training technical cadres and triangulation surveying personnel, other practical staff will be trained as needed.

(4) For areas where land registration consolidation has been completed, if there are significant changes in land prices, a reassessment will be conducted according to law.

(5) Strictly implement district supervision and thorough technical inspection to ensure rapid and accurate progress.

(6) Land registration consolidation should be closely linked to household registration. The names on the land register and the household registration book must be consistent.

To the Editor: I read with dismay the article published on page 3 of your newspaper on the 5th of this month, entitled "Security Team's Attempt to Confiscate Funds Failed, and Self-Defense Team's Weapons Were Seized."

### Jiangsu Provincial Government Stipulates Regulations for Handling Addictive and Non-Addictive Opium Offenders

[Our Newspaper Suzhou 17th Dispatch] The Jiangsu Provincial Government believes that the handling of addictive and non-addictive opium offenders in various counties promoting anti-drug policies is often divergent, which greatly affects the effectiveness of anti-drug policies. Therefore, in accordance with laws and regulations, it has formulated regulations and ordered various counties to follow them in order to unify the handling of such cases. The regulations are as follows: (1) Opium addicts caught in the act, even if they are proven to be addicted and non-addictive, should be prosecuted. (2) Those accused of opium addiction who are proven to be addicted and non-addictive, if they cannot provide sufficient evidence to prove that they have been falsely accused or have voluntarily undergone treatment, should be punished as appropriate, even if they were not caught in the act. (3) Those who were addicted to opium but have voluntarily undergone treatment before being discovered, and who are proven to be addicted and non-addictive, cannot be prosecuted if there is no evidence to prove that they have continued to use opium after treatment. (4) Those who have been addicted to opium and have quit through treatment or compulsory treatment, and who are subsequently found to be addicted and non-addictive, will not be prosecuted if there is no evidence to prove that they have relapsed.

### Jiangsu's In-Kind Land Tax Collection Overcomes Difficulties and is Progressing Smoothly, Completion Within the Deadline is in Sight and Expected to be Successfully Completed

— Our Newspaper Reporter Li Xianglin

Zhenjiang News

Since the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Provincial Land and Food Office held a provincial Land and Food Business Review Conference on July 20th of this year, they have actively launched preparations for the start of in-kind collection work. During this preparation period, it encountered many difficulties. The major premise of this difficulty is that Jiangsu Province was the first to suffer eight years of enemy devastation. This is not only the case for the food administration, but also for various other undertakings, due to the loss of balance of manpower and resources, forming a weak syndrome like a patient's poor nutrition after illness. However, the fact is the opposite. Since the in-kind land tax collection in Jiangsu started on September 15, although the preparation period was quite short, its gains and achievements have a considerable foundation. Its difficulties and weaknesses have gradually been broken through and dissipated, and this historically difficult and heavy burden is being promoted smoothly in 38 counties and cities in Jiangsu Province. According to Deputy Director Hong Qichen, who recently returned to the province from inspecting various counties in Jiangnan, in a conversation with our reporter: This trip to Wujiang, Suzhou, Changshu, Kunshan, and other four counties was generally very successful. All staff members were able to uphold the government's intentions and work hard to serve, which is very gratifying. All of the above counties have started collection. Because all the registers in Wujiang have been fully issued, the collection is very smooth and there are no difficulties whatsoever. The registers of Suzhou, Changshu, and Kunshan counties are currently being rushed day and night, and will be fully completed in a short period of time. The institutions of township offices and collection warehouses in each county have also been established one after another. When the reporter asked about the results after the start of collection in various counties and cities in the province, he replied: As of the 10th of this month, according to the reports to the Provincial Office, Zhenjiang has more than 2,000 Shi, Gaochun has more than 2,000 Shi, Taizhou has more than 9,000 Shi, Liuhe has more than 18,000 Shi, Yangzhou has 1,500 Shi, Jiangning has 30,000 Shi, Danyang has 3,500 Shi, Jiangpu has 7,500 Shi, Yizheng has more than 5,600 Shi, Jiangdu has more than 6,300 Shi, Liyang has more than 2,300 Shi, Jurong has more than 5,700 Shi, all of which are counties that collect rice. Among them, Gaochun, Jiangning, Liuhe, and Yizheng are collecting more slowly because there is more late rice and the harvest is not continuous. The counties that pay in legal tender, Nantong, are more than 2 million yuan, and Taicang is more than 150 million yuan. According to Hong, in the final statement, Jiangsu's land tax has finally smoothly embarked on a smooth path. This is certainly due to the assistance of various local forces, and at the same time, I feel exceptionally gratified with the spirit of the staff. I hope this spirit will be maintained permanently, then, although the deadline of December 15 is not far away, it must be able to be completed successfully.

Four Ways

According to Mao Junbai, the section chief of the Management Department of the Provincial Land and Food Office, the actual situation of Jiangsu's in-kind land tax collection is as follows: Before the start of in-kind collection, because the preparation period was rushed, coupled with Jiangsu's congenital imbalance, in order to adapt to local conditions and suit the environment, it was collected in four ways: (1) collection of rice, (2) collection of wheat, (3) collection of cotton, (4) payment in legal tender. In counties and cities that collect rice, the original regular and surcharge taxes are calculated and temporarily converted by 40%. Each yuan of tax is collected with 3 Shi Dou of rice, 1 Shi Dou is borrowed, and 9 Shi Sheng of public grain (30%) is collected, for a total of 4 Shi Dou and 9 Shi Sheng (that is, each yuan of tax is actually collected with 1 Dou and 9 Sheng and 6 He). The counties that collect wheat are calculated at 70% of the rice, that is, each yuan is collected with 2 Shi Dou and 1 Shi Sheng, 7 Shi Sheng is borrowed, and 6 Shi Sheng and 3 He (30%) of public grain is collected, for a total of 3 Shi Dou and 4 Shi Sheng and 3 He (that is, each yuan of tax is actually collected with 1 Shi Dou and 3 Sheng and 7 He). The inspection tools for the aforementioned in-kind collection use standard weighing instruments and take Shi Jin as the unit. Two or less is rounded down, rice is 108 Shi Jin per Shi Shi, and wheat is 145 Shi Jin per Shi Shi.

Adapt to Local Conditions

There are a total of 27 counties that collect rice, namely: Jiangning, Gaochun, Jurong, Liyang, Lishui, Danyang, Jintan, Yixing, Wujin, Wuxi, Suzhou, Wujiang, Changshu, Jiangyin, Qingpu, Jinshan, Songjiang, Kunshan, Yangzhong, Jiangdu, Liuhe, Yizheng, Jiangpu, Zhenjiang, Taixian, Jingjiang, Chuansha, etc. The total amount to be paid by the above counties is 3,881,052 Shi Shi. There are three counties that collect wheat, namely: Xuzhou City, Tongshan, and Donghai, with a total of 37,403 Shi of wheat to be collected. There is only Chongming County that collects cotton. Because the county produces miscellaneous grains, it has been changed to pay more than 50,000 Shi of corn. There are seven counties that pay in legal tender: Shanghai, Taicang, Baoshan, Jiading, Nanhui, and Fengxian, with a total amount of 15.7 billion yuan to be collected. Finally, according to Mao, if all 38 counties collect all the taxes by December 15 of this year, with each yuan paying 1 Dou 9 Sheng 6 He, there may be more than 4,715,000 Shi, and the central government can get 1.7 million Shi, and the city and county can also get 1.7 million Shi. The rest can be kept for provincial use. If this is the case, the establishment of the national food administration, the adjustment of military and civilian food, the funding of provincial and county expenses, and the desire to build a new Jiangsu will often be easy to achieve.

Situation in Northern Jiangsu

Finally, the reporter asked whether land taxes could be exempted in the counties in northern Jiangsu after their recovery. The answer was: The Provincial Government and the Provincial Provisional Council have repeatedly appealed to the Central Government to exempt land taxes in northern Jiangsu for one year. It is now heard that this matter may be approved. The reasons for the exemption are nothing more than two points: (1) Northern Jiangsu has been devastated by enemies, puppets, and bandits in the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War. After the victory, it was again occupied by the Communist army. The local vitality has been greatly damaged, and the rural areas have been extremely bankrupt. Although the counties have been recovered one after another, they were all forcibly requisitioned and taken away by the Communist army during the period of occupation. Even if there are any leftovers, they are not many; (2) The efficiency of in-kind collection is not enough, because the registers of the recovered counties are lost and the household registration is chaotic, which cannot be done without a considerable period of sorting. From the above facts, Jiangsu's in-kind land tax collection has finally been promoted smoothly. We hope that this major event can be completed quickly and on schedule.

### Special Port Problem Breakthrough: Four Foreign Ministers Reach Agreement on Governor's Authority

[Report from our New York Correspondent, 17th] The four foreign ministers are making final efforts on the Trieste Free Territory issue to reach a compromise. Not long ago, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov proposed fourteen amendments, insisting that these were minimum conditions and could not be altered. However, Molotov's attitude has softened in recent days, and US Secretary of State Byrnes is said to share this sentiment. Once the Trieste issue is resolved, the four powers can draft the final draft of the peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland, and then proceed to draft a peace treaty with Germany.

[United Press, New York, 16th] Today's four-power foreign ministers' meeting overcame a key hurdle regarding the future of the port of Trieste, paving the way for a peace treaty with Italy. According to attendees, the four foreign ministers are close to reaching an agreement on the administration of the port. US Secretary of State Byrnes insisted on upholding the rights of minorities and the foundation of the United Nations. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has apparently shown compromise, agreeing that the Trieste government has supreme authority, and withdrawing the original demand to reduce government power. Undersecretaries of State are now responsible for drafting today's agreement into articles for presentation at the meeting on the 18th.

[United Press, New York, 17th] The foreign ministers' meeting made progress today on resolving the issue of Trieste's administration, but encountered new obstacles regarding the deadline for the withdrawal of occupying forces. At the close of today's meeting, it was decided to refer the issue of who should manage the Trieste police to French Undersecretary of State Couve de Murville to draft an agreement. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's renewed proposal of a deadline for the withdrawal of occupying forces from Trieste may hinder the foreign ministers' reaching a resolution.

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 17th] During today's four foreign ministers' meeting, a compromise plan proposed by the French representative regarding the powers of the governor of Trieste and the local security director was discussed and generally passed. It was immediately handed over to the four undersecretaries for final review. The plan stipulates four points:

(1) The position of security director of the Trieste Free Territory shall be appointed and dismissed by the governor after consultation with the local Administrative Committee. The security director is responsible for thoroughly recruiting and dismissing security personnel. (2) In peacetime, the security director is supervised by the Administrative Committee. The committee regularly listens to the director's reports and discusses with him all matters within his authority. (3) The governor attends the Administrative Committee, listens to the committee's instructions to the security director, and participates in the discussion when necessary. The governor may also permit or oppose the implementation of various administrative measures. (4) If the governor believes that an emergency has occurred that is sufficient to violate the independence and integrity of the free zone or infringe upon human rights, he may personally order appropriate measures to be taken and report to the United Nations Security Council. The governor may also personally command the security forces when necessary.

Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov believes that the definition of "emergency situation" should be limited to events affecting the independence and integrity of the area. This is only a matter of definition and will be resolved by the undersecretaries' meeting tomorrow. Before adjourning today, the issue of the withdrawal of foreign troops from the Trieste area was reviewed, but no agreement was reached.

### Veto Problem in the Security Council: Gu Weijun Expresses His Views, UN General Assembly Political Committee Suspends Debate, Five Major Powers to Discuss Restrictions Today

[Special dispatch from the Central News Agency, New York, 16th] My chief representative Gu Weijun seconded the principle of great power unanimity today during the first discussion of the veto dispute in the Political and Security Committee of the General Assembly. In his speech, Gu opposed the proposals of Australia and Cuba to restrict or abolish the veto power stipulated in Article 27 of the United Nations Charter, but suggested improving the most practical ways to apply Article 27 as follows: (1) Adopt a long-term plan to study and gradually improve its proper use; (2) Improve procedural regulations through discussion, definition, and regulation; (3) Reach a freely agreed and commonly recognized interpretation. Gu, like all other permanent members of the Security Council, also firmly opposed amending the Charter. He stated that the Chinese delegation does not believe that the time for amending the Charter has arrived. This document is the actual reason for the principle of unanimous intent of our United Nations organization. The consensus that exists today is the same as it was when the Charter was signed. Any rash attempt to amend the Charter at this time could fundamentally shake the foundation of our organization. Gu proposed two of the most practical ways to solve the veto problem: (1) Suggest that the Security Council take steps to promote a more complete and rational application of Article 27 and improve its procedures. (2) Request that the five permanent members provide detailed explanations of the statements made at the San Francisco Conference on the application of the veto power, and, where possible, list the items that only require procedural votes.

[United Press, Lake Success, 16th] France today proposed to the Political Committee of the UN General Assembly to suspend debate on the veto issue pending prior discussion by the five major powers. British representative Noel-Baker then spoke, severely criticizing the Soviet Union for abusing the veto power, which caused various issues that could have been resolved unanimously to be hindered everywhere due to the Soviet Union's extreme unilateralism. However, Noel-Baker also expressed the same firm opposition to amending the UN Charter as the four major powers, as requested by the smaller countries. Saudi Arabia advocated that the General Assembly suspend discussion of the veto issue, and Noel-Baker expressed support. It has now been decided that the five permanent members of the Security Council will decide on restrictions on its use themselves in New York on Monday. British Foreign Secretary Bevin, Chinese Ambassador to the United States Gu Weijun, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, US Secretary of State Byrnes, and French representative Parodi have all agreed to participate. Although there was no opposition to the French proposal to suspend discussion in the General Assembly, it was not put to a vote today, pending the speeches of the three countries' representatives who had already registered to speak after the meeting on Monday. In any case, the decision of the five major powers to meet on Monday will not change. After the Political Committee suspends discussion of the veto issue, it will proceed to discuss the second issue, which is the Soviet Union's request that all countries report the number of foreign troops stationed in their countries. The veto issue will be discussed again after the five major powers submit a report from their meeting.

### On the Eve of the Romanian General Election, the US Lodges Fourth Protest

[United Press, Washington, 17th] Today, the United States sent a fourth note to the Romanian government, protesting again against the preparations for the election next Tuesday. This move appears to be the last protest before the election. The United States, as one of the three responsible countries for implementing "free" elections in Romania, lodged this protest with strong language, urging the Moscow-backed Romanian government not to forget its promises. It also accused the Romanian government again of not allowing the opposition to use newspapers and radio for campaigning, repeatedly preventing the opposition from holding political rallies, and even of government-sponsored violence and widespread abuse of the opposition.

[United Press, Rome, 17th] The British and American governments are now planning to lodge another protest with the Romanian government regarding its actions related to the election next Tuesday. It is reported that the note will express dissatisfaction with Romania's response to the previous protests of the UK and the US. On the eve of the election, Romania is engaged in a heated last-minute campaign. Campaign slogans are plastered on the walls of Bucharest for miles, and trucks with loudspeakers are broadcasting propaganda. The first-time participation of women in Romanian elections has further intensified the campaign. Romanian Interior Minister Gheorghe, a Communist, told the press today that he expects some bloodshed during the election, but no major incidents. He also admitted that 200 opposition members have been arrested and imprisoned, but said that all but those who will be tried by military tribunals have been released and can participate in the campaign.

### UN General Assembly Committee Passes Equal Rights for Women Resolution

I Approve of the Danish Proposal

[Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency, New York, 16th] The Social, Humanitarian, and Cultural Committee of the UN General Assembly met today and passed a Danish proposal recommending that the General Assembly suggest that member states take measures to ensure that women obtain equal rights with men in politics. Chinese representative Madame Niu Huizhen approved of the Danish proposal and stated that China has already recognized that its women enjoy equal rights with men in politics. She also pointed out that the Chinese National Political Council and its Presidium already have female members (participating, and the draft Chinese Constitution also clearly stipulates that all Chinese citizens are equal before the law regardless of gender.

### Alarms Sound Loudly: It Turns Out to Be a Fire Drill, Four Foreign Ministers Get a False Alarm

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 17th] The four foreign ministers were holding a meeting at the Astoria Hotel here this afternoon when suddenly alarms sounded loudly outside. British Foreign Secretary Bevin suspected it was an air raid alarm. The four foreign ministers all left their seats and rushed to the window to investigate, only to discover that it was just a police and fire drill. They were relieved and returned to their seats for the meeting.

### British Prime Minister Takes a Wartime Stance to Deal with Splinter Party Members, Will Submit a Motion of Confidence to the Lower House, Eden Speech Supports Bevin's Diplomacy

[United Press, London, 16th] Prime Minister Attlee is preparing to take a wartime stance and request a vote of confidence from the Lower House for the first time on the 18th to deal with the "rebellious" actions within the Labour Party against his policies. Government sources claimed today that Attlee will use this move to prove how weak the forces of the four Labour Party rebel members are. Whether the Prime Minister will move to extremes will depend on the debate of the "rebel" members at the meeting on the 18th.

[United Press, Newcastle, England, 16th] Former British Foreign Secretary Eden delivered a speech here today, expressing his firm trust in the current Foreign Secretary Bevin. Eden did not mention the resistance of a small number of Labour MPs to the government's foreign policy, but said that Bevin is now proceeding on the right path. As far as he knows, he is seeking to establish the power of the United Nations organization and strengthen the effectiveness of international law, which is the only policy that Britain should adopt.

### Communist Party Holds a Large Meeting in Jerusalem

Busy Military Movements in the Middle East

[Report from our Correspondent in London, 17th] The British authorities are very concerned about the situation in Jerusalem. According to the intelligence agency spokesman's words to reporters: Today, a small team of British troops on the Baliwei highway hit a landmine, killing and injuring more than a dozen people. Also, on the anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution, the Communist Party of Palestine held a conference in Jerusalem, urging Jews and Arabs to unite against British and American imperialism.

[Reuters, London, 17th] The Sunday Times Jerusalem correspondent said: Military movements in the Middle East are very busy. By the beginning of January next year, the military and police strength in Palestine will reach 125,000. Today, troops from Egypt, Italy, and the Far East are being sent to Palestine. The movement is limited to one battalion at a time, but its goal is to have two infantry divisions, a division of armored and airborne forces each.

[United Press, Jerusalem, 17th] Reliable military sources here claimed today that the estimated number of British troops currently stationed in Palestine is 100,000, which may double within the year, including four full combat divisions. The British move is largely due to the fact that a decision on the Jewish-Arab issue in the Holy Land may be made after January 1, and more troops must be dispatched to implement this decision.

### Large Gold Mine Discovered in Western Australia

[Agence France-Presse, London, 16th] Eleven Italian miners recently discovered one of the world's richest gold mines near Kalgoorlie in Western Australia. They have already excavated six tons of rock and extracted gold sand worth US$851,000.

### Contents of the Anglo-Egyptian Agreement Released

[Saudi Arabia, Sukuma News Agency, Cairo, 16th] After British Foreign Secretary Bevin and Egyptian Prime Minister Sidky signed the Anglo-Egyptian Agreement in London, the agreement was recently released here. It stipulates that British troops will be completely withdrawn from Egypt by September 1, 1949. British troops stationed in Cairo, Alexandria, and the lower Nile River will be completely withdrawn by March 31 of next year, and other areas will be withdrawn. During the transition period, British troops will still enjoy the special rights stipulated in the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty. In addition, there are two protocols. One concerns the withdrawal of British troops, and the other concerns the de jure status of Sudan.

### Iranian General Election Imminent: Martial Law in the Capital Area

[Agence France-Presse, Tehran, 17th] The Iranian government has declared martial law in the capital and its surrounding areas due to the upcoming general election, prohibiting people from carrying weapons. Party meetings outside of party headquarters are also prohibited.

### Greek Guerrilla Warfare Still Raging: Government Denies Sending Armored Troops into Macedonia

[Report from our London Correspondent, 17th] The Greek situation is very tense, and guerrilla warfare is ongoing. The night before last, a team of 300 numbered troops attacked Yazhangqi Si, killing 4 Greek soldiers and injuring 7; raided Ouwu and left 50 corpses behind, retreating towards Yugoslavia. Near Durabisia, Greek police were also attacked by an unidentified army, killing 4 people. Two guerrillas were sentenced to death and executed by firing squad.

[Reuters, Athens, 17th] The village of Skra, formerly occupied by about 700 bandits, was recaptured by government forces on Friday, but fighting is still taking place near Mount Skra. Another village was attacked by 300 guerrillas, who came from within Yugoslavia. It is reported that the Greek government is collecting evidence of guerrilla activities and plans to submit them to the United Nations and other countries.

[Reuters, Athens, 16th] The Greek Minister of Public Security said that the bandits in the mountains of eastern Greece are conquering villages and towns in the provinces of Thessaly and Thrace, kidnapping people for ransom. If government troops are present in the attacked area, they will retreat.

[Another Telegram] The Greek General Staff solemnly denied that the government had recently sent armored units to the Macedonia region to suppress the rebellion, pointing out that the conflict area, Skra area, cannot be entered by tanks.

### It Is Said That Britain and the United States Intend to Treat Shigemitsu Leniently

The Soviet Union Holds a Deep Grudge Against Him

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 16th] There is widespread speculation here about the Tokyo International Military Tribunal's abandoning the trial of former Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Mamoru. It is said that the American prosecutor is unwilling to list Shigemitsu alongside other war criminals as defendants, and wishes to release him. The following points are said to be under consideration: (1) Shigemitsu is now disabled, having been injured in the leg by a bomb in Shanghai. (2) Shigemitsu represented Japan last year in signing the Japanese surrender document on the American battleship Missouri. (3) After the outbreak of the Pacific War in 1941, he sent a secret letter to US Ambassador to Japan Grew. Observers say that the British prosecutor also intends to treat Shigemitsu leniently, because during his tenure as ambassador to the United Kingdom, Shigemitsu indicated to his government that war would lead to catastrophe and therefore requested that the authorities use peaceful means to expand their power. On the other hand, the Soviet Union holds a deep grudge against Shigemitsu because in 1930, when he was in Moscow, he threatened former Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov, attempting to force the Soviet Union to make concessions on the "Manchurian" border.

### Pauley Report on Japanese Reparations Published

[United Press from the Central News Agency, Washington, 16th] Ambassador Pauley, the representative of the Allied Reparations Commission, suggested to President Truman that all Japanese manufacturing materials and artificial rubber, aluminum, and magnesium factories be shipped out. He also suggested that a large number of Japanese electrical factories, steel and alloy factories, and oil refining, railway, merchant ship, and other equipment be shipped out. Pauley's report also suggested that certain Japanese industries be completely included in the list of reparations materials. These industries are handicrafts and light industries that are necessary for the reconstruction of Japan. The disposal of the Japanese woolen textile, artificial fiber, cotton, and paper industries will be discussed in the future. The US State Department has now released Pauley's recommendations.

### Pope Pius XII Will Convene Christmas Bishops' Conference to Appoint Five Cardinals

[United Press, London, 16th] Moscow Radio broadcast: The Roman news media learned that Pope Pius XII intends to convene a special Christmas Bishops' Conference to appoint five cardinals. Also on the list is Archbishop Stepinac of Zagreb, Yugoslavia, who was recently sentenced to 16 years in prison by the Southern National Court for colluding with the Axis powers. The Pope's elevation of him is likely intended as comfort.

### Siam Returns Vietnamese Territory: France and Siam Sign Agreement

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 16th] French Ambassador to the United States Bonnet and Thai delegation head Prince Wan Waithayakon have reached an agreement on the issue of Siam returning the land formerly belonging to Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. The two countries' agreement will be signed into effect tomorrow.

### Goering's Entire Estate Is Only 750 Marks

[Agence France-Presse, Nuremberg, 17th] Hermann Goering, Germany's second-ranked war criminal, once controlled nearly the entire Ruhr industrial area and collected art treasures from all over Europe. His entire estate, consisting of only 750 marks, was handed over to his wife today by the local security authorities. Before his arrest, Goering had deposited 50,000 marks in the Deutsche Bank, but his wife was not allowed to cash them. Allied control authorities have not yet made a decision on this matter.

### The Threat of a New War Has Not Been Eliminated: Be Prepared to Cope with Incidents: Truman Addresses Naval Students

[This Newspaper Report] San Francisco, Broadcast on the 17th: President Truman left Washington for West Florida today and will return to Washington about a week later.

[Agence France-Presse, Annapolis, Maryland, 16th] President Truman came here from Washington to visit the Naval Academy and addressed the students. He said that the United States must be prepared for the possibility of a new war. The United States has suffered greatly from the devastation of two world wars and made significant sacrifices, so it must prepare for the occurrence of extraordinary events. He hopes that future American leaders will handle national affairs with the interests of the public and world peace as the premise. He cited Marshall as a prominent example of a military man, and the American president can hardly do without him. He said that Marshall is doing unparalleled work in China.

### Severe Damage to the People from the Peruvian Earthquake

At least 15,000 people were affected. Peruvian army planes are now carrying food, clothing, and medicine to be dropped off to aid the residents.

### Japan During the Occupation (Part 2) - The Occupation Work is Divided into Three Stages

— By P. Lauter, Tokyo Correspondent for the New York Times, Translated by Zhang Degan

The Japanese government has accepted the order to end all support for State Shintoism. Shintoism, through its 110,000 shrines, has deeply penetrated the lives of 75 million Japanese people, forcing them to at least verbally acknowledge the Emperor as a god and the Japanese as descendants of gods who must act on behalf of heaven to rule the world. All auxiliary organs through which the Japanese military clique exercised its power have been eliminated, and hopefully, they are eliminated forever. This includes the secret police, thought police, news censorship, military training in schools, and military life, etc.

By the end of the year, the second phase of the occupation, namely the eradication of feudalism, will be almost complete. Although new elements are still being purged and many new war criminals are yet to be exposed, it may still be necessary to use force to threaten and prevent the resurgence of bad tendencies or the emergence of new undesirable elements.

The third phase of the occupation is still ahead of us because the new institutions have been subjected to various pressures and threats from within and without. The food problem, the production problem, and the financial problem are all very serious, with no solution in sight—only temporary measures, such as importing some American military rations to feed the Japanese.

In the first year of the occupation, the United States expressed its responsibility to solve these many problems, otherwise, it would have to admit the failure of the US policy toward Japan. If possible, it should restart and do it again. However, the various issues of the third phase are extremely important and worthy of detailed study in themselves.

Japan's economic situation is so bad that no country would willingly sacrifice butter and consume its national wealth on guns and cannons to avoid it. They must rely on exports to have food to eat, and to export, they must manufacture—they must also pay an unknown amount of reparations, most of which must be paid with machinery. Japan's material well-being is naturally Japan's fundamental problem, but as far as this reporter knows, no one dares to advocate allowing Japan to rebuild its old military strength to revive the Japanese Empire. However, this is also a United Nations problem because economic collapse leads to chaos, and in the past, chaos has led to violent politics, which has led to war. The current chaos in Japan, once the time is ripe, could create a new Pacific War, just as the chaos in Germany eventually produced Hitler.

The supreme leader of the entire occupation apparatus is MacArthur—who himself happened to be demobilized from the battlefield to become an administrative official; his demobilization was much easier than that of many GIs who left the army and returned home to tinker with gasoline barrels. He must follow the general principles of the Potsdam Declaration and carry out the instructions of the Far Eastern Commission; however, he is the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, and his position is strictly a "one-man position."

According to most observers, the United Nations Control Commission for Japan provides little valuable assistance to MacArthur's headquarters. Some pessimists even call it a "debating society" whose main function is to allow the representatives of the United Nations to vent their anger. Even without this committee, the occupation work would have been done to the same extent as it is today.

MacArthur's face seems slightly older than when this reporter first set foot in the Southwest Pacific Theater in the summer of 1944 in Australia; however, there is no significant change, although the energy he has spent on the war and the occupation work is enormous. He lives with his wife and young son Arthur in the American Embassy. He has a small office in an insurance company building in the city, with dark wood panels on the walls, two landscape paintings hanging, and a glass-door bookcase behind it, which is empty.

MacArthur's working hours are very long but strangely scheduled. He gets up very early, handles part of his official business at home, and does not go to the office until 11 o'clock. He may not leave the office for lunch until 2 o'clock, and then return to the office to work for two hours, not leaving until long after the usual dinner time. MacArthur has almost no social life. The embassy's dinner parties have been reduced to a minimum, and he only attends the most solemn banquets. In the past, during the arduous fighting of the first landing in the Philippines, everyone hid in their shelters, but he was accustomed to strolling in the corridor with his head exposed, watching the Japanese bombs fall. Like him, even his own subordinates know very little about him to this day.

The purely military tasks in the occupation work are handled by General Eichelberger, who has traveled thousands of miles throughout Japan to investigate how his Eighth Army soldiers are living, feeling, working, and playing. MacArthur has only left Tokyo once, to go to the Philippines to attend the Independence Day celebration.

What is the Japanese reaction to the first year of the occupation? This is a very difficult question to answer. In fact, the Japanese have not only offered no resistance but are extremely willing to cooperate. However, after the occupying forces withdraw in the future, will the Japanese be willing to maintain the system we have established? Or will they modify it? Or will they overthrow it completely? It depends on how the Japanese evaluate the system and what its actual results are. Most Japanese people's opinions on the system are perhaps yet to be decided and, of course, have not been expressed at all.

### Municipal Party Headquarters Hosts Cultural and Film Industry Figures: Appeals for Building a New Culture - Runaway US Dollar, Soaring Prices of Noodles, Meat, and Coal Are the Work of the Communists - The Situation Is Grave, the People Should Understand Right and Wrong

[Report from this Newspaper] The Municipal Party Headquarters held a reception yesterday afternoon at 3 PM at the Police and Social Affairs Office on Shaoxing Road, inviting over a hundred figures from the city's cultural, film, and theater industries, including Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Chairman Fang, and prominent figures from all walks of life. During the reception, discussions were held on the current direction of the cultural movement, the current political situation, and the issue of exposing traitors in the film and theater industries. Mayor Wu also revealed for the first time that the soaring prices of pork, flour, and coal, and the runaway US dollar, are due to the sabotage and manipulation of the Communist Party. Li Pingqian reported that during the fall of Shanghai, film industry figures who remained in Shanghai followed the instructions of Jiang Bocheng, Wu Kaixian, and Wu Shaoshu to stand their ground and prevent the enemy puppets from seizing control. As for the films produced by "Huaying," most people believe that only "Spring River's Regret" and a small portion of "Wan Shi Liu Fang" are problematic.

Party Affairs and Cultural Work Should Be Integrated

Fang Zhi began by stating, "We have invited you here today not for a mere social gathering. Party affairs work should be integrated with cultural work, and we want to take this opportunity to exchange views with you and make some points. First, we hope that the cultural figures will promote culture and civilization. Today, Chinese culture has not yet reached the level that the people of the whole country hope for. Moreover, in some regions, the sound of gunfire continues, and the people are displaced and living in turmoil. We should do our best to promote the Four Cardinal Principles and Eight Virtues, as the basic principles of propriety, justice, integrity, and honor, as well as loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, and peace, are fundamental to maintaining the existence of the Chinese nation. We must popularize this inherent culture and express it in all aspects of point, line, and quality. Second, we should build a new culture and a new country. The so-called new culture is the Three Principles of the People's culture that the people of the whole country need. Everyone can love the country and the nation, everyone can do their best and get what they need, and everyone can manage themselves with the Three Principles of the People's culture. The spirit of the Three Principles of the People's culture includes peace, happiness, democracy, and unity. This is what the Chinese people truly need. Using guns to fight our own compatriots and destroying peace and unity is the culture of the Communist Party. We must first build a new culture of the Three Principles of the People before we can build a new China of the Three Principles of the People. Third, the cultural circles should strengthen unity, exert the power of the cultural circles, unite together, and cooperate. Finally, Fang said, I still want to say a few fair words, because recently there has been a sudden accusation that there are suspected traitors in the film and theater circles, making friends in the film and theater circles feel insecure and unable to work in peace. In fact, some of those who have been accused are those who followed the instructions of underground comrades of the Party Headquarters to stay in Shanghai and stand their ground. How can they be called traitors? If we want to deal with it, we should deal with the organizers. I hope everyone can unite, remove those who are rebellious, and jointly clear the wronged.

Should Recognize the Truth and Serve the People

Next, Mayor Wu spoke, saying that there can be a simple answer to the so-called culture, that is, the difference between humans and animals. The biggest difference between humans and animals is that animals are completely selfish, while humans are able to be unselfish and unselfish. People have compassion, sympathy, a sense of truth, and courage to do what is right. The so-called high cultural level is to pursue the truth, have compassion, be unselfish and unselfish, and serve the public. Since I took office in Shanghai in May, the Communist Party has become radicalized because what the Communist Party has done violates the above standards. Since May, I have tried to stabilize prices, but sometimes there is no way. It is true that some price increases are due to profiteers seeking only profit, but another part is not caused by profiteers. For example, there is no way to deal with pork because the meat is transported from Jiangbei, the Soviet area under Communist control. Merchants transporting pigs must first provide a receipt, and after returning, they must pay taxes in US dollars and gold bars. How can the price of meat not rise? After the retreat, the piglets in northern Jiangsu were either killed or taken away, resulting in a lack of sources. Secondly, wheat, this year there was a bumper harvest in northern Jiangsu, but the Communist Party either transported the wheat away or burned the wheat, so the price of flour in Shanghai had to be adjusted. Thirdly, the city is short of coal this winter, which is also a gift from the Communist Party. If the Tianjin-Pukou Railway were open and the coal mines were not destroyed, there would be no problem with coal in Shanghai. The rumors of rising US dollars and exchange rate fluctuations are due to the Communist Party using counterfeit currency to extract 120 billion yuan in legal tender and searching the market, causing panic. The Communist Party talks about peace and unity on the surface, but in reality, everything they do is destructive, so cultural figures should recognize the truth and serve the people.

The Situation is Indeed Serious, But Not Hopeless

Then, Speaker Pan Gongzhan spoke, first describing his personal love for drama and film and his emphasis on the correct use of the effects of film and drama. He also explained that the decision to suspend the drama school was made by the Senate, not by the Speaker personally or any Senator. The Senate represents all the citizens of Shanghai, not a certain aspect or a certain region. The Senate's decision at that time was based on the fact that the city government's funds were insufficient, and there were too many school-age children who were out of school. At this time and place, national schools were more urgent than drama schools. There was no intention to belittle drama schools or drama. As for whether the Senate's motion needs to be reconsidered, it should be decided by the Mayor. What the result of the reconsideration will be depends on the opinions of all the Senators. The current situation has indeed reached a critical juncture. However, it is not hopeless. Because at first, the Communist Party said that if the National Army took Zhangjiakou, it would be a split. After Zhangjiakou was taken, they suddenly changed their tune and said that the key to the situation was the ceasefire. And after the government issued a ceasefire order, they said that it was a unilateral ceasefire, which was equivalent to fighting. I really don't know what kind of logic this is. The National Army's ceasefire is a unilateral ceasefire, which means that the Communist Army still wants to fight. If the Communist Army is also willing to have a unilateral ceasefire, wouldn't that be a ceasefire on both sides? Even so, it has not broken down. The Communist Party changed its name to convene the National Assembly and it will break down. Now that the National Assembly has been convened, the Communist Party calls it a one-party monopolized divided National Assembly and will not participate. It also said that if the National Army attacks Yan'an, it will be a complete break. Zhou Enlai also said that peace talks can still be reopened. It can be seen that it is not completely hopeless. But if we want the Communist Party to participate, the only way is for the real people to speak up, then the Communist Party will have to come. The people should have right and wrong, and they should have judgment. I hope you will recognize the truth. The current situation depends on two forces, either the power of the people decides, or another greater force decides. If the people are to decide, we must rely on the cultural circles to awaken our compatriots. General Fu Zuoyi said that the places where the Communist Party has been are like getting a vaccination, meaning that only those who have suffered from the Communist Party know its harm.

Speaker Pan also explained the accusation of traitors in the film and theater industries, according to the central government's laws and regulations, only those in the film and theater industries who presided over propaganda for the enemy puppets are guilty. The newspaper reported that it was an investigation case, and if the investigation is innocent, the prosecutor will not prosecute.

Other speakers included Li Pingqian, Shi Dongshan, Yao Pengzi, Ying Yunwei, etc. Finally, there was also entertainment, and the event ended at about 6 o'clock.

### Black Market Trade in Blood Plasma - The Chairman is Extremely Concerned - Has Ordered the Department of Health to Thoroughly Investigate

[Report from This Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] Song Ziwen met with reporters this afternoon to comment on the black market trade in American blood plasma, stating that this batch of blood plasma was sold directly to Shanghai merchants by the US Foreign Surplus Property Disposal Administration's Shanghai office and had nothing to do with the government. However, because it is the blood of Americans, the Chairman is paying close attention to it and has ordered the Department of Health to conduct a thorough investigation. Although our government is not responsible for it, we are also very concerned about it.

### Ten-Year Gas Plan - Experts Hired to Form a Technical Committee - The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau is Formulating Policies - Three Gas Plants Provide a Continuous Supply - Daily Production Reaches 10 Million Cubic Feet

The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau has recently drafted a "Ten-Year Plan" for reorganizing the gas industry. According to Zhao Zengyu, the director of the bureau, the bureau has drafted a plan to develop the gas industry to meet the needs of 15 million citizens based on the current situation and future needs. According to the results of past years' statistics, there were only a few thousand gas users in the city before the war, with a daily output of about one million cubic feet. During the War of Resistance, people from all over the country concentrated in the urban area, and the population increased sharply. Due to the high cost of fuel, the number of people who switched to gas reached 20,000 households (19,000 households for the British Gas Company and 1,000 households for the Wusong Gas Plant). The daily gas production was 3.5 million cubic feet for the British factory and 500,000 cubic feet for the Wusong factory, for a total of 4 million cubic feet. However, the equipment of both factories was damaged by the enemy, and it was difficult to replenish equipment after the victory. After repeatedly increasing the usage limit, the current supply has reached the maximum load point, and it is impossible to increase production any further. Therefore, it is impossible to accept new users who apply for gas installation. In order to remedy the above difficulties, the Bureau has specially invited experts to form a gas technology conference to seek both stopgap and fundamental solutions from a technical point of view. The stopgap solution is to solve the current panic of gas supply. There are currently three steps being considered: (1) Using coal with a higher volatile content, which can increase gas production by about 25 to 30 percent. (2) Actively repairing existing gas generators to increase gas production efficiency and avoid shutdowns. (3) Advise users not to waste unnecessarily, so that every cubic foot of gas can be used to its maximum effect. These three steps are now being actively carried out and are expected to achieve satisfactory results within the year.

As for the fundamental solution, it will be based on the principle of cooperating with the Greater Shanghai Urban Plan, in order to build Greater Shanghai. At present, the city's population is only 4 million, and the gas supply is already felt to be insufficient. If the urban plan is implemented, the population will increase to 15 million. Therefore, the fundamental solution will be aimed at supplying the gas needs of a population of 15 million. The steps are divided into five items: (1) According to past records, gas consumption increases by 5% per year, calculated at compound interest. After ten years, gas consumption will increase to a daily output of 9 million cubic feet. In addition, due to the increase in industrial use, Shanghai will need 10 million cubic feet of gas in ten years. (2) It is planned to establish a new gas manufacturing plant along the Huangpu River in Nanshi, with a daily output of 4 to 5 million cubic feet. At the same time, the equipment of the Wusong Gas Plant will be expanded, and fume furnaces will be added to enable it to produce 2 million cubic feet of gas per day. Together with the British Yangshupu Plant's daily output of 4 million cubic feet, the city will have three gas plants located around Shanghai, collectively controlling the city's gas supply. (3) It is planned to lay a high-pressure pipe supply network and gas supply stations throughout the city, connecting the high-pressure pipes of the three plants to each other. If this is the case, when one plant has an obstacle, the other plants can supply gas in its place, so that the gas supply will never be interrupted. (4) Since the gas plants are located in three locations, the city's future gas supply area will also be divided into three major supply areas based on the location of the plants, namely the Wusong, Shishan, and Jiangwan industrial areas, which will be supplied by the Wusong Gas Plant; the city center, Yangshupu, Zhabei, Hongkou, and the area north of the Suzhou River, which are adjacent to the Yangshupu Plant, are planned to be supplied by the plant; the old French Concession in the city, Huxi, Nanshi, and other areas south of the Suzhou River will be supplied by the Nanshi Gas Plant. In this way, each district is close to the manufacturing plant, which is convenient for supply and ensures that the pressure is normal, without the problem of insufficient pressure. Its service efficiency can also be improved as a result. (5) Unified management of all plants, the British Gas and the Municipal Wusong Gas Plant, due to the exclusive contract relationship, operate in different areas, each going its own way, which is unreasonable, and its impact on the gas supply and the obstruction of the formation of the city's gas network is very large. Therefore, after the expiration of the British Gas Company's exclusive rights, the gas company will be merged to actively increase production under unified management.

### Fight Over Wharf Results in Violence - Two Wenzhou Gang Members Injured

[Report from This Newspaper] The dockworkers at the Kangqu Bridge Wharf in Nanshi's Shihui Port were originally from the Wenzhou Gang. Recently, they were seized by the Jiangqin Gang. The Wenzhou Gang was unwilling to accept this, and although several mediations were made, they had little effect. It was originally scheduled that the Social Affairs Bureau would convene both parties this morning to seek a reasonable solution. However, at about 3 PM yesterday, Jiangbei Gang leader Shan Baoquan, also known as Shan Asi, first gathered dozens of workers and clashed with a small number of Wenzhou Gang workers in Jinfu Lane on Longhua Road. At that time, due to the disparity in numbers, Wenzhou Gang workers Ge Axi and Li Shunsen were injured. When the Longhua Branch reported this, the police were dispatched to the scene, but the murderers had already fled. The police are now investigating the matter.

### Wife Goes to Hotel for Secret Rendezvous - Husband Stabs Adulterer

[Report from This Newspaper] Wang Ligui, 42 years old, from Zhenjiang, lives at No. 18, Dexing Lane, Yunnan South Road, and usually runs a sock stall. Three months ago, his wife had an affair with Ying Guoqing, a seal carver who had a stall nearby, and they often had secret rendezvous in hotels. Over time, their affair was exposed, and Wang found out about it, but he remained silent. One day, Ying and his wife borrowed a guest house to continue their pleasure. Wang rushed to catch them in the act and finally captured the adulterous couple. After people came forward to mediate, Ying wrote a letter of repentance and paid a settlement of 100,000 legal tender. However, at 9:30 PM last night, Wang Ligui learned from his 14-year-old daughter that his mother had gone to a hotel with Ying again. Wang became enraged and searched everywhere. As he was walking near Baxian Bridge, he happened to meet the adulterer Ying Guoqing head-on. Wang pulled out a sharp knife and stabbed him in the right arm and right middle finger, causing profuse bleeding. He was arrested by the police and taken to the Taishan Branch for investigation.

### Fugitive Criminals Captured in Zhabei

[Report from This Newspaper] The Taishan Police Station received a tip a few days ago that fugitive criminals and their accomplices were hiding at No. 403, Guangfu Road, Zhabei. On the morning of the 15th, the branch dispatched a large number of police officers to the address, first surrounding it, and then a part of them bravely rushed in. Two notorious robbers were sleeping soundly and were arrested together. A revolver and four bullets were found in the closet and taken to the station for interrogation. According to Cao Bin and Zhu Baofu, they confessed to committing numerous crimes and were scheduled to be handed over to the garrison headquarters for legal prosecution.

### Trolleys and Buses - Officially Increase Fares Today - Route 8 Buses Also Start Running - Separate Preferential Measures for Military and Police Passengers

The fares for buses and trolleys in the city will officially increase today. First-class trolley tickets are divided into four types: 200 yuan, 300 yuan, 400 yuan, and 500 yuan. Second-class tickets are divided into three types: 100 yuan, 200 yuan, and 300 yuan. Trackless trolleys are not divided into classes, and their fares are divided into three types: 200 yuan, 300 yuan, and 400 yuan. Bus fares are divided into six types: 200 yuan, 300 yuan, 400 yuan, 500 yuan, 600 yuan, and 700 yuan. Among them, the British and French trolleybuses and the French and municipal buses have slightly different prices due to the different lengths of the routes.

The Route 8 buses operated by the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau will officially start running today. The starting point is the North Station, passing through Shishan Road, Tiantong'an, Weidemai Road, and ending at Wujiaochang. Route 9 buses are currently being actively prepared, and the planned route is from the New World to Damuqiao in Nanshi (the Citizens' New Village built by the Municipal Public Works Bureau), and it is expected to officially start running in early next month.

Due to military and police personnel riding buses without tickets, the income of public vehicles in the city has been directly affected, and the order in the carriages is also extremely chaotic. In order to rectify this situation, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau has consulted with the Military Affairs Department and the 23rd Gendarmerie Regiment and agreed on preferential measures for military and police passengers. The companies will jointly issue 1,200 long-term free bus passes for military and police personnel, which will be distributed by the Garrison Headquarters to the 900 troops stationed in Shanghai by the Navy, Army, and Air Force. The remaining 300 passes will be distributed by the Garrison Headquarters and the Police Bureau, 150 each. These free bus passes are limited to military and police personnel on official business who are neatly dressed and wear insignia. For military and police personnel without these free bus passes, separate preferential measures will be formulated. The trolley fare will be 100 yuan per ride, regardless of distance, and the bus fare will be 200 yuan per ride, but it is also limited to those who are neatly dressed and wear insignia. These measures will also officially take effect today.

### "Mummy" Shanghai Lane News: Old Monk Gilds Himself After Death, Claiming it as the Result of Spiritual Practice

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] This is news that is sure to spark conversation among readers. The "Mummies" of Egypt are world-famous, and the "Mummies" of the Hangzhou Museum are equally fascinating. But we never knew that Shanghai also had a "Mummy," perhaps due to superstition, its custodians have always kept it a secret. But this secret has finally been discovered.

As far back as four years ago, in the Tianzhen Buddhist Hall at No. 92A, Lane 500 on Yidingpan Road, there was an old monk named "Qiu Zunsong, Dharma Master." He believed that with his piety, he was qualified to "pass away peacefully" and ascend to heaven. So, four months before his death, he cut himself off from food and only sipped thin porridge, gradually not even drinking porridge, only eating fruit to satisfy his hunger. And for the hundred days before his death, he didn't even drink a drop of water.

One day, he seemed to have a premonition of death, and he asked his disciples to invite a barber to shave his head. Then he said, "I am going to return to heaven." He also instructed his disciples not to cremate his "physical body." Then, he asked for three watermelons, sat in the lotus position, and passed away as if he were dozing off. This was on the fourth day of the third month of the lunar calendar in the 31st year of the Republic of China [1942].

His disciples, following their teacher's last words, did not cremate Dharma Master Qiu Zunsong's body. Instead, they used two large earthenware jars as a coffin, covered them together, and placed them in the Buddhist hall. To prevent the body from decomposing, they placed charcoal, rosin, sandalwood, and incense sticks throughout the jars.

After eighty days, Qiu Zunsong's young disciple, driven by curiosity, opened the two jars. He thought that the body should have decayed beyond recognition, but to his surprise, his teacher was still sitting in the lotus position as if he were dozing off, and his skin and flesh had not come off at all. The only difference was that his skin had turned white.

This sight, in the eyes of the young monk, did not conjure up the new term "Mummy." What he realized was that his master had "ascended to heaven" and "become an immortal." So, he worshiped his master every day as if he were still alive.

During the Mid-Autumn Festival that year, this secret was suddenly discovered by a couple of pious believers, Mr. and Mrs. Ying, who were burning incense. They also believed that Qiu Zunsong's spiritual practice was worthy of worship. So, they wanted to gild this "Mummy." Naturally, the young monk did not object, and the grand ceremony of gilding was solemnly held. First, the young monk gave the body a full bath and dressed it in a summer cloth shirt. Then, he mixed flour into a paste and brushed it over the body and clothes, and finally applied the shimmering gold.

The gold statue that the reporter saw had a slightly drooping head, wrinkles on its forehead, exposed ribs, and closed eyes, draped in a large red shawl, sitting in the lotus position in a shrine that was glass on three sides and wood on one side. The young monk said, "His head was originally straight, supported by incense sticks under his neck, but later a child broke the incense sticks, and his head drooped down."

Now, the golden remains of this Dharma Master Qiu Zunsong have been regarded as a "Bodhisattva" and are worshiped with incense by pious men and women!

### Letter to the Editor

I have found that the content of the news item "Former Haimen County Magistrate Detained in Shanghai" published in your newspaper on the 12th of this month's news column is inconsistent with the facts. I, the undersigned, served as the Haimen Magistrate for ten months, enduring the perilous situation surrounded by bandits and puppets, fulfilling my duties with integrity, upholding the law, and rectifying corruption to the best of my ability. Recently, I was transferred to the provincial government for inspection, and at the beginning of the month, I handed over my duties and passed through Shanghai on my way to the province. Suddenly, I was falsely accused by malicious people and secretly reported to the garrison, resulting in a misunderstanding and surveillance. Now, after investigation, it has been confirmed that the accusations are false, and the provincial government has sent personnel to Shanghai to negotiate, proving that the fact of my employment in the provincial government is irrefutable. The report that I was carrying weapons is indeed true, but all of them are registered public and private firearms, and the guards accompanying me are local troops dispatched for escort due to the insecurity of the waterways. In addition to filing a lawsuit against the accusers and publishing a statement in the newspaper, I am sincerely afraid that the outside world will not understand the truth, so I specially request that you make a correction to clarify the truth and rectify public opinion. Respectfully, Liu Daoping.

### Social Services - Reader Consultations

Legal Questions

(1) Divorce and Remarriage

Shen Wenhua asks: A friend, Mr. A, whose wife, Ms. B, is in love with two men and has filed for divorce from A. A agrees and is willing to make a written agreement stipulating that if B marries C, the agreement will be invalid. Can this agreement be established in law?

[Answer from Lawyer Fu Kuangling] B asked A for a divorce because she is in love with C, so after the divorce, there is no reason not to marry C. If taking not marrying two men as a condition for divorce, then this condition is equal to a mere formality. B and C can live together temporarily without getting married, and then get married later when the time is right. In fact, it is difficult to force them to fulfill the conditions attached to the divorce agreement. The law has no explicit prohibition, except that those who are divorced or declared adulterous after being judged for adultery may not marry the adulterer.

(2) Difficult to Grow Old Together

Wang Nongyin asks: Your relative, Mr. Xu, married Ms. Wu from the same village in the 30th year of the Republic of China [1941] through a matchmaker. At first, they were safe and sound, but then they had disagreements due to incompatibility and often had disputes. Ms. Wu felt that it would be difficult to grow old together in the long run, so she painfully divorced Ms. Wu. However, the procedures in the countryside are mostly inconsistent with the law. Now there are questions: (1) If both men and women are willing to divorce unconditionally, will a lawyer's signature and certification be legally valid? Does the woman's parents have the right to interfere? (2) If Mr. Xu draws up a divorce certificate and Ms. Wu signs it, is it valid? (Ms. Wu is illiterate.) (3) If Ms. Wu leaves without saying goodbye, and Mr. Xu publishes a warning in the newspaper, treating it as a permanent separation of the marital relationship, is it legally valid?

[Answer from Lawyer Fu Kuangling] (1) If a husband and wife divorce by mutual consent and a lawyer makes a certification, it is naturally valid in law, but it must be certified by two or more people. If both men and women are of age (20 years old is of age), the parents have no right to interfere; (2) It is appropriate to handle it in accordance with the methods described in the first paragraph of the above; (3) If the wife leaves without saying goodbye, it is malicious abandonment of her husband, which constitutes grounds for divorce. In order to avoid future disputes, a warning should first be published in the newspaper, setting a time limit for her to return home. If she does not return after the deadline, apply to the court for divorce.

### Overview of the Emergency Medical Loan Society in the First Half of the Month

The society recently received 1,160,000 yuan donated from Yuan Gong Jing Qi's ninetieth birthday celebration, and it is recalled that sick families have repaid loans totaling 300,000 yuan.

### Atrocities Forgotten in Leniency; Executioners are About to Return Home

Why are so few war criminals being tried? Why can't they be punished as they deserve?

Were the rapes, murders, and arson all illusions?

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Time often fades people's memories. Today, it has been just over a year since the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, and everyone seems to have gradually forgotten the various atrocities and abuse suffered at the hands of the enemy during the eight years. At least it can be said that they are no longer very enthusiastic about how to punish those war criminals who were once ferocious executioners. Although the government has set up several institutions to manage and try war criminals, the only results in the past year, apart from some intermittent news in the newspapers, are the execution of Sakai Takashi in Nanjing and the death sentence of Shimoda Jiro, known as the "Tiger of Jiangyin," in Shanghai (but it still cannot be executed to this day). And the more than 1,000 suspected war criminals concentrated near Jiangwan to undergo "reform" for more than a year are said to be sent back to their country before the end of the year.

Perhaps some people suspect that among so many suspects, why are there so few real war criminals? Are the countless crimes that countless people have personally experienced and witnessed in the past all illusions and unfounded rumors? I remember that the last time a comrade in distress identified the enemy's constitution, the wife of a martyred martyr said very angrily to the manager: "Don't let them go back, shoot them all with machine guns!" This wife's idea is certainly too naive, but it can enlighten us that there are indeed many compatriots who still have grievances that have not been redressed among the people. Therefore, some people cannot help but ask: Why can't war criminals be punished as they deserve as soon as possible?

The Difficulty Lies in the Lack of Evidence

According to the authorities in charge, the greatest difficulty lies in the lack of "evidence." Because now the international community talks about "civilization," unlike the wild era before, the victorious side can kill the captured enemies as much as they want, and we must maintain the demeanor of a great power. Even though the enemy did not treat us with morality at the beginning, now we must treat the enemy with fairness. To be fair, of course, everything must be based on the position of the law; to be based on the position of the law, everything must have evidence. Since we cannot use their own methods to treat them and "torture them to extract confessions," we can only watch them escape!

Victims are Afraid and Cowardly

So what are the difficulties in collecting evidence? In addition to some clues that do not leave any traces at all and cannot be found, the cowardice and fear of the Chinese people often make the judges who are in charge of the interrogation both cry and laugh. Many victims have this idea: the matter has passed, let it go! Why bother to find trouble again! It is really rare to have enthusiastic people like Lin Chao, the manager of the New Asia Electric Factory, who was motivated by righteous indignation and willing to assist the court to collect evidence of Shiba Genpei's rape of women in Ningbo. According to what the reporter heard, there was once a witness who refused to testify. He even said: "If I testify in court, I don't know if I can convict him based on what I say. If the Japanese regain power in the future, I will suffer again." This kind of cowardly psychology of the quasi-conqueror is of course regrettable, but in contrast to the chaotic situation in the country in the past year and the increasingly prosperous Japanese situation, it is indeed inevitable to be vigilant.

The Responsible Authorities Have Many Restraints

In addition, various travel expenses and so on make it difficult to hope that they will be willing to come to court to testify voluntarily, and the responsible authorities themselves have been slow to carry out their work due to the lack of funds and personnel restraints. For example, the management agency has adopted a lenient and appeasement policy due to the weakness of the guard force; the trial agency has been halted for several months due to the replacement of the presiding judge; and the lack of funds and vehicles has made investigation and interrogation difficult.

One person in charge said it well: "We have been imprisoning them for more than a year, but we cannot produce evidence. It is embarrassing to continue imprisoning them, so we have to let them go back." Although it is said that if evidence of guilt is found in the future, they can still be brought to China, but this is probably just talk. All we can hope for now is that those war criminals who are already imprisoned in the Tilanqiao Prison will be punished as they deserve as soon as possible!

This office that manages another world, in addition to being filled with incense, has become a lively market…

### A Brief History of the Shanghai City God Temple [Special Report from Our Newspaper]

The Shanghai City God Temple, which has a history of more than 500 years, is a place that every traveler who comes to Shanghai for the first time must visit. This office that manages another world, in addition to being filled with incense, has become a lively market, comparable to the Confucius Temple in Nanjing and the Xuanmiao Temple in Suzhou.

The earliest City God Temple in Shanghai was already established in the Song Dynasty, but it was not in its current location. At that time, Shanghai was only a town, and there was no City God Temple. There was only the City God Temple of Huating County, which was enshrined in the Danjing Temple. Therefore, the Danjing Temple was also called the Xingdian of the Huating City God Temple. In the 29th year of Zhiyuan in the Yuan Dynasty (1290 AD), Shanghai was made a county, and the City God Temple was established, but it was still enshrined in the Danjing Temple.

The current City God Temple inside the New North Gate was rebuilt from the Jinshan Temple by Magistrate Zhang Shouyue during the Yongle period of the Ming Dynasty—between 1403 and 1424 AD. The Jinshan Temple, also known as the Huo Guang Xingci, was dedicated to Huo Guang, the Marquis of Bolu of the Han Dynasty. According to the "Wu Yue Bei Shi," it was built at the end of the Three Kingdoms by Sun Hao, the King of Wu. When it was changed to the City God Temple, it still enshrined Huo Guang concurrently, so there has always been a saying that "Huo is in the front temple, and Qin is in the rear hall." (Qin refers to the City God Qin Yubo.)

Having Endured Many Changes in Five Hundred Years

At the beginning of the reconstruction of the City God Temple, it was not as large as it is today. It has encountered many disasters in more than 500 years. The red walls, purple tiles, and clay sculptures have endured many changes. Each time it was damaged, it was expanded during repairs, and it gradually became the current situation. The first repair was during the Tianshun period of the Ming Dynasty (1457-1464), when Magistrate Li Wen built a pavilion in front of the temple and inscribed the imperial edict on stone. In the 14th year of Jiajing (1535), because the temple gate was too small, the temple managers raised money to build a memorial archway. At that time, the newly appointed Magistrate of Shanghai, Feng Bin, inscribed the four characters "Haiyu Baozhang," which were written by a prodigy from Yongjia. (See Wanli Shanghai County Records.)

In the 30th year of Wanli (1602), Magistrate Liu Yikuan rebuilt it again, but it was destroyed by fire in just four years. In the 34th year, it was rebuilt by Magistrate Li Jizhou. At the beginning of the Chongzhen period of the Ming Dynasty, a theater stage was built on the Yimen, and a bedroom was added behind the temple.

By the 22nd year of Kangxi in the Qing Dynasty (1683), Magistrate Shi Cai donated his salary to advocate repairs. The Taoist priests of the Zhenjun Temple raised funds to build two drum pavilions (see Kangxi Shanghai County Records). In the 48th year of Kangxi (1710), local people built the East Garden in the east of the temple, and the City God Temple became a famous scenic spot in the city. In the 13th year of Yongzheng (1735), the abbot of the temple raised funds for repairs. In the 13th year of Qianlong (1748), the bedroom was destroyed by fire and was rebuilt by Magistrate Wang Ting.

Mid-Qianlong Period - Shops Densely Packed

From the reconstruction of the Jinshan Temple until then, the temple base covered an area of 12 mu and 6 fen, which was not very large. It was not until the mid-Qianlong period that the Yuyuan Garden was purchased as the West Garden of the City God Temple. The land was divided and repaired, and it was expanded to 36 mu and 8 fen and 9 li and 2 hao. And tourists gradually saw that the temple base was expanded to 36 due to the increase in guilds, and it eventually became densely packed with shops.

### Disasters and Difficulties in the Past Two Hundred Years - Eight Robberies

In the past two hundred years, the City God Temple has really been "full of disasters and difficulties." It has suffered five fires and three military robberies. After the first fire in the 13th year of Qianlong, it was repaired many times. In the 59th year of Qianlong (1794), Ge Wenying raised funds to build the back building. In the 3rd year of Jiaqing (1798), the main hall was renovated again, and twenty-four divisions were arranged in two rows, with four division halls outside the Yimen and to the west of the hall. In the 16th year of Daoguang (1836), it suffered a second fire robbery, and the west wing and the theater stage were burned down. Later, it was rebuilt with funds raised by merchants.

From the 22nd year of Daoguang to the 10th year of Xianfeng (1842-1860 AD), China was in turmoil due to internal strife and foreign aggression, and the City God Temple also suffered unprecedented misfortune. It encountered three military robberies. The first time was on the 11th day of the fifth month of the 22nd year of Daoguang, when it was occupied by British sailors for five days as a temporary garrison. The second time was in the 3rd year of Xianfeng, when Lin Afu and Liu Lichuan, the leaders of the Small Swords Society, led their troops to occupy Shanghai. The City God Temple was occupied as their headquarters for one year and six months. The third time was in the 10th year of Xianfeng, when the Taiping Army approached, Wu Xu, the Su-Song-Tai Taoist Priest, invited British and French troops to enter the city to defend it, and the City God Temple was changed into a British and French barracks. The blue-eyed devils destroyed the garden scenery and suffered considerable losses. In the 4th year of Tongzhi (1865), Magistrate Wang Zonglian and others rebuilt it, spending more than 18,000 strings of money, and it took nine months to restore the City God Temple to its former glory. In the 19th year of Guangxu (1893), Magistrate Huang Chengxuan raised funds to build the front gate, the second gate, the yuan gate, the main hall, the theater stage, and the drum pavilion. The Yunyun Board of Directors of the Cao Board of Transport hung a plaque with the inscription "Bao Li Cang Chi."

At that time, there were more and more tourists and shops in the temple. Various industries saw that there was profit to be made, and they rented out the remaining land to build houses and set up shops, until there was almost no vacant land in the garden. Therefore, in the 24th year of Guangxu, Magistrate Huang Chengxuan issued an announcement: "It is permanently forbidden to build houses on vacant land, which would damage the garden." In the 1st year of Xuantong (1909), Magistrate Li Chaoqiong raised funds to repair the walls and the main hall and bedroom.

Three Fires After the Republic of China

After the Republic of China, it suffered three fires. On the eighth day of the tenth lunar month of the 11th year of the Republic of China, there was a fire, and the local public fund property office repaired it. On July 15th of the 13th year, the main hall caught fire and was burned down, and the tuosha statue of the Jinshan City God was also robbed. On November 26th of the same year, a corner of the east building was burned down, affecting the halls and pavilions. Later, the Yimiao Board of Directors, together with Du Yuesheng, Huang Jinrong, and Zhang Xiaolin, donated funds to rebuild it, spending 50,000 silver yuan. Construction started in April of the 15th year of the Republic of China and was completed in November of the following year. A steel and concrete building was built. On the 25th of the same month, the Yimiao Board of Directors displayed rare delicacies and followed ancient rituals to offer sacrifices and hold an opening ceremony. On that day, pious men and women came to the temple to visit in an endless stream.

New City God Temple - Dusk

In the 26th year of the Republic of China, the War of Resistance Against Japan broke out, and the South City was captured by the enemy. The city was also ravaged, and refugees gathered in one corner. At that time, Father Rao rose up and set up a refugee area. The houses in the area were preserved, and the City God Temple was located within it. However, because the enemy cavalry was everywhere, it was difficult to enter and exit. Therefore, those who relied on the "Old Master" for food put their minds to work and built the "New City God Temple" on Luzon Road. The shops were lined up, and life was thriving. And this "Xibei" Old Master, relying on the shelter of the "Concession," also attracted the incense offerings of pious men and women. After the victory, the original site of the South City had mostly returned to its former appearance, and the "fallen Old Master" had long been included in the repatriation list, and the incense was revived. The New City God Temple on Luzon Road is already "dusk," and its fate will not be long.

### Different Views in the Eyes of Foreigners

The Spanish writer Ibáñez, in his posthumous work "A Novelist's Journey Around the World," expressed his heartfelt praise for the Shanghai City God Temple, especially for the Huxin Pavilion and the Jiuqu Bridge in the City God Temple. He also praised the "Old Master's Garden," saying that the Chinese regarded the buildings as the Egyptian pyramids and the White House in Washington were regarded in the minds of Westerners.

The impression of the former French consul Mei Peng of the City God Temple was that the streets were so noisy and disturbing that they made noise to attract good gods and also made noise to drive away evil gods.

So he arbitrarily came to a conclusion:

"The Chinese do not like quietness, and even seem to be afraid of quietness."

A reporter from the North China Daily News wrote an explanation on the photos of the Huxin Pavilion. He didn't say much, just said:

"Tourists who go to the teahouse like to prepare two copper coins of pastries for themselves and throw them to the fish and turtles in the pool to eat."

The former Anglican Church pastor Da Wend, who had traveled all over Shanghai, expressed the following thoughts:

"We ran into the City God Temple… In the afternoon, this courtyard is a market, and people think of the merchants in the ancient Temple of Jerusalem. There are snack shops, toy shops, incense shops, and tricksters here."

### Records of the City God Temple's Annual Events

Before Shanghai was opened as a commercial port, the City God Temple was the only place of entertainment for the entire city. Therefore, there were many grand events throughout the year. Although most of these have now become historical relics, in order to preserve local customs and research materials, I will record, to the best of my knowledge, the following detailed account:

New Year:  The inner garden and Cui Xiu Tang (Gathering of Elegance Hall) of the City God Temple were customarily open twice a month on the first and fifteenth days of the lunar calendar for people to visit. Only during the first ten days of the New Year were the doors open all day, and ladies and gentlemen came and went in droves, making the roads crowded. The first day of the New Year was especially congested.

Plum Blossom Exhibition:  Every year on the third day of the first lunar month, the inner temple would open a plum blossom exhibition for visitors to enjoy.

Lantern Festival:  On the night of the fifteenth day of the first lunar month, the temple was ablaze with lights and decorations, and the sounds of music were like boiling water. The ban on night travel was lifted, and crowds of visitors gathered. A few days before the Lantern Festival, there was also a "lantern market" where vendors gathered near the temple to sell colorful lanterns.

City God's Birthday:  Tradition says that the City God's birthday is on the twenty-first day of the second lunar month. Taoist priests would set up altars to chant scriptures, and the "subordinates" of the "Old Master" would come to pay respects and offer birthday wishes.

City God's Wife's Birthday:  On the twenty-eighth day of the third lunar month, the temple was decorated with lanterns and colorful streamers. Many ladies came to watch, and the spectacle was often far grander than the "Old Master's" birthday.

Three Patrols:  The City God customarily went on patrol three times a year to "aid and relieve lonely souls." The dates were the day before Qingming Festival, the fifteenth day of the seventh lunar month (Mid-Autumn Festival), and the first day of the tenth lunar month. When the City God went on patrol, he would be accompanied by his staff: the Four Departments of "New River," "Tall Man," "Gaochang," and "Wealth," with ceremonial guards leading the way. Citizens would hold incense and flowers to follow. There were also often courtesans, heavily made up and dressed in gorgeous clothes, wearing... or sitting in open palanquins, pretending to be "female prisoners." This inevitably attracted frivolous young men, who flocked to them as if startled.

During the Tongzhi reign, Magistrate Ye Tingchun issued a strict prohibition.

Start of Summer:  According to old customs, new wheat had to be offered as a sacrifice. The Orchid Exhibition was held every year in the late fourth lunar month in the West Garden. The exhibition lasted for three days and was open to the public. All kinds of fine orchids were displayed, competing for beauty. The one that was ranked first was hailed as the "Top Scholar."

Heaven's Gift Festival:  On the sixth day of the sixth lunar month, tailors from all over the city held a "robe-drying festival" at the City God Temple.

Chrysanthemum Exhibition:  Held in mid-September, but not every year, the exhibition featured chrysanthemums that were judged and ranked according to "novelty," "nobility," and "rarity." The names of the chrysanthemum owners were labeled on the pots. The first chrysanthemum exhibition was held at the Four Beauties Pavilion.

### The City God Temple After Restoration: One Side Says "A Spirit Omen Costs 500 Yuan," the Other Says "Beware of Pickpockets"

[Special Report by Our Newspaper]  The weather is cold, but the City God Temple is still as lively as ever. This City God, who has returned after being restored to his position, is receiving the worship of his devout followers amidst swirling incense smoke. On the large pillars on either side, one side says "A Spirit Omen Costs 500 Yuan," while the other says "Beware of Pickpockets."

However, the number of people who come to the City God Temple to burn incense and pray is far less than the number of people who come to stroll around for leisure. The temple's religious significance has been overshadowed by the atmosphere of a commercial market. As soon as you enter the gate, there are all kinds of stalls selling daily necessities such as towels, mirrors, and tea cups, as well as stalls selling squid ribs and fermented rice cakes. There are also philosophers who offer fortune-telling services. However, business is very slow. People seem to come here just to stroll around and don't really want to buy anything.

The Nine-Bend Bridge is also packed with people, just like Nanjing Road. The people in front block your way, and the people behind push you forward. If you randomly grab someone and ask what they are doing squeezing around in this cold weather, they won't think you're crazy, but they won't pay attention to you either. There are many people in Shanghai who spend their lives squeezing around in crowds.  At the corners of the bridge, there are also some small stalls. These stalls are different from the stalls inside the temple. They are a world of American goods: selling military food boxes, glass belts, and "American brushes."

The water in the pond under the bridge is murky, with scraps of paper, chestnut shells, and all kinds of waste floating on the surface. Yet, some people lean on the railing and stare blankly at it, wondering if they really want to discover some miracle or find a swimming fish?

After crossing the bridge, it is still crowded with people and stores one after another. The people in the stores put their hands in their sleeves, lean on the counters, and watch the people squeezing around. Among these people squeezing around, there are also those who stop and look at the goods on the shelves in the store. But after looking for a while, they squeeze past again.

Turning the corner, you reach the World United Commercial Center. Stepping up the stairs, there are even more people. In this room where the air is so foul that it is unbearable, people squeeze together with great interest, and you can often hear people shouting, "Squeeze! Squeeze!"

The reporter also squeezed in and squeezed out like this.

### A Discussion on the City God Temple Gardens: In the Blink of an Eye, They Have Become Relics of the Past

East Garden

"North of the temple, a famous garden is opened, east of the shrine, separate halls are built,

Even more, I plan to climb high and gaze at the clouds, a small altar on earth built by carriages."

This is a poem written by Cao Yishi, a Jinshi (successful candidate in the imperial examination) from this county, for the Small Spirit Terrace in the East Garden of the City God Temple. The East Garden is also known as the Inner Garden and was built during the Kangxi period. Later, due to the expenses incurred by the money industry for renovations, the guildhall was established here. After the opening of the concession, the money industry in the northern part of the city flourished, and all public affairs related to the northern and southern parts of the city were discussed here. Later, the money industry guildhall was established in the southern part of the city, and the money industry guildhall was also established in the northern part of the city, making this the main guildhall.

Although the garden's foundation is not very large, it seems that considerable effort was spent on its construction at that time. The Tongzhi gazetteer states: "The ponds, trees, and rocks are all ancient and elegant, truly a scenic spot. The winding railings, long corridors, flowers, and trees are all secluded and deep in the garden. The best part is the Small Spirit Terrace." According to Cao Yishi's preface, "The terrace is over ten zhang (about 33 meters) high and only wide enough for banquets, and the east, south, and north sides of the Huangpu River are all visible." This shows that the terrace was quite high at the time, enough to climb and overlook the surrounding area. According to the Shanghai County Gazetteer of the Qianlong period, "The terrace was originally in the eastern corner of the East Garden, but it is now abandoned." The larger one was rebuilt around the Jiaqing period and was located in the southwest corner of the garden, only a few zhang high.

The West Garden's Predecessor: The Old Site of Yu Garden

The West Garden was originally the old site of the Pan family's Yu Garden. It was built during the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty by Pan Yunduan, a native of this county who was serving as the Sichuan Provincial Administration Commissioner. His intention was to serve his father, Pan En, and provide a place for him to enjoy his old age. The garden covered several tens of acres and was built over twenty years, using the entire family's wealth. The scenic spots in the garden at that time included:

Yuhua Hall (Jade Splendor Hall), Huijing Hall (Gathering of Scenes Hall), Rongyu Hall (Hall of Leisure), Zuiyue Tower (Drunken Moon Tower), Yixiu Pavilion (Catching Elegance Pavilion), Yule Xuan (Fish Joy Pavilion), Leshou Hall (Joyful Longevity Hall), Liuying Pavilion (Retaining Shadows Pavilion), Hanbi Pavilion (Embracing Jade Pavilion), Zhengyang Tower (Upright Sun Tower), Yuyin Pavilion (Jade Shade Pavilion), Yiwan Tower (Comforting Evening Tower), Liuchun Cottage (Retaining Spring Cottage), Fuyi Pavilion (Duck Leisure Pavilion), etc.

In addition, there were family shrines and various other shrines. Ponds were dug, rocks were piled to form mountains, and ponds and rocks were scattered throughout the garden. The land had the beauty of ravines, ridges, and caves, while the water had the charm of islands, beaches, bridges, and ferries. Famous flowers and precious trees were planted, and winding beams and pavilion paths were arranged. Climbing the mountain made it easy to overlook the surroundings, and boating was enough to tour around. In addition, there were family shrines built in the garden. At the entrance, the Pan family inscribed the words "Human Realm, Pot Heaven." West of the entrance, on the high wall, were inscribed the words "Embrace the Universe." Pan's pride can be imagined.

Cycles of Prosperity and Decline: Good Times Do Not Last

However, gardens in the world cannot escape the cycles of prosperity and decline. Good times do not last. By the time of Pan's descendants, the family fortune had gradually declined, and Yu Garden was neglected and eventually ownerless. It was purchased at a low price by the people of the county and incorporated into the City God Temple. At that time, during the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, the East Garden already existed east of the temple, so it was called the West Garden. It was rebuilt over twenty years at a cost of tens of thousands of taels of silver. The original garden base was said to be over seventy acres, but according to the Qing Dynasty land survey in the seventh year of Tongzhi, it was only thirty-six acres, eight fen, nine li, and two hao. Although rocks were still piled up and ponds were dug, and flowers and bamboo were planted, most of the exquisite buildings were used as guildhalls for various industries. The reason for this was as follows: The West Garden was a public building, and it could not be managed without someone in charge. However, if a special management organization was established, the annual expenses, especially the land taxes, would pose a major problem. Therefore, at that time, various industries used a "semi-borrowing" method, designating a portion of the garden as their guildhall while also being responsible for paying taxes and repairing the buildings. The scenery of the West Garden at that time was completely different from the Yu Garden era. If you read through the sections recorded in Qiao Zhongwu's "Record of the West Garden" and Yu Ziquan's "Ying Xuan Magazine," the old scenery of the West Garden would seem to be before your eyes.

Later, the Chaoran Terrace (Transcendent Terrace), Huijiong Tower (Returning Echo Tower), Dianchun Hall (Touching Spring Hall), and Five Old Peaks were added, and Wanghua Hall (Viewing Flowers Hall) was renamed Xiangxue Hall (Fragrant Snow Hall), and Wanhua Deep Place (Ten Thousand Flower Deep Place) was renamed Wanhua Tower (Ten Thousand Flower Tower). As a result, there were more scenic spots and endless streams of visitors.

Two Disasters of War: The Lakes and Mountains Were All Destroyed

In the twenty-second year of Daoguang (1842 AD), British warships occupied Wusong and were stationed at the City God Temple. The red lotuses planted at the Nine-Bend Bridge were the first to be plundered. In the third year of Xianfeng, the Small Swords Society uprising occurred, and the garden's precious pavilions became the nests of the rebels. When the Qing troops entered the city, the West Garden was destroyed by fire. Xiangxue Hall became a field of rubble, and Lotus Flower Hall, Deyue Tower (Gaining Moon Tower), Flower God Pavilion, and others were also turned to ashes. Only the strange rocks such as the Five Old Peaks and Jade Linglong still stood tall, the pond remained intact, and the green water was still there, vaguely recognizable as the old scale. In the tenth year of Xianfeng (1860), the Taiping Army entered the territory, and British and French troops entered the city to help defend it. The West Garden was used as a military camp, and as a result, the artificial mountains suffered, and the lakes and mountains were all destroyed. After the peace, although Circuit Intendant Ding Richang negotiated their withdrawal, the West Garden had already been trampled and destroyed beyond recognition!

In the fourth year of Tongzhi (1865), it was rebuilt, and it was焕然一新 once again. However, because it was starting from scratch, its scenery was very different from the old West Garden. Only the Jade Linglong stone in front of Xiangxue Hall is still a relic of Yu Garden. Legend has it that this stone was a relic of the flower and stone network during the reign of Emperor Huizong of the Song Dynasty. When it was being transported across the Huangpu River, a strong wind suddenly arose, and the stone and the boat sank into the water. Later, a giant rope was used to drag it up from the water, and that is this Jade Linglong stone. The top of the stone has the two characters "Yuhua" (Jade Splendor). The "Yuhua Hall" built by Pan Yunbo, the owner of Yu Garden, was named after this. In addition, there is the Kuixing stone (Star of Literature Stone) by the Nine Lions Pavilion. It is a relic of the West Garden from the Qianlong period. "Records of the Country of Swamps" says, "It was originally an object of Wang's Su Garden." It originally had the shapes of the Great Scholar, Kuixing, Hanshan, and Shide, five towering stones, hence the name Five Old Peaks, but only one remains today. The remaining buildings were all added after the war.

From the rise and fall of the gardens, we can also roughly see the signs of governance and chaos in Shanghai over the past three hundred years.

### Shanghai's City God, Qin Yubo, Is 650 Years Old This Year

It is said that the City God of this city is Qin Yubo, a waiting official of the Ming Dynasty. These two words "It is said" are based on the "Ode to the City God of Shanghai County" in the "Four Yanzhai Wenji" written by Cao Yishi of the Qing Dynasty, and the "Hu Cheng Beikao" written by Chu Wenzhou. They all unanimously said it was "Lord Qin Yubo", but it is difficult to find accurate evidence, so this "It is said" has been handed down to the present.

Qin Yubo, courtesy name Weirao, also Jingrong, alias Kuizhai, was the seventh-generation grandson of Qin Shaoyou, a scholar of the Longtu Pavilion in the Song Dynasty. His great-grandfather was Tianyou, and his paternal grandfather was Zhirou. Their ancestral home was Gaoyou County, Yangzhou Prefecture. Due to the chaos of the war at the end of the Song Dynasty, his grandfather moved to Shanghai. His father was named Lianghao, alias Shuzhai, and his mother was Tang. Qin Yubo was born on June 12th of the second year of Yuanzhen (July 25, 1295 AD). Calculating it, this year is exactly 650 years old.

Qin's childhood

He followed his father to Daming, registered in Daming and studied in the Imperial College. At the age of forty-nine (the fourth year of Zhizheng in the Yuan Dynasty, 1344 AD), he passed the imperial examination. He then served as the registrar of the Huguang Provincial Administration, and in the tenth year of Zhizheng (1350 AD), he was promoted to Magistrate of Gaomi County, Shandong Province. Two years later, he was promoted to Assistant Minister of the Fujian Provincial Administration. At the end of the Yuan Dynasty, the world was in chaos. He abandoned his official position and lived in Yangzhou, and soon moved to Shanghai. At that time, Zhang Shicheng occupied Suzhou. Hearing of Qin's virtue, he sent people to invite him to take office, but he did not go. In the twenty-fifth year of Zhizheng (1365 AD), his mother, Tang, passed away. He observed mourning at home. When Emperor Taizu of the Ming Dynasty rose up to quell the chaos, he ordered the Central Secretariat to summon him. However, Qin was stubborn by nature and had no interest in fame and fortune in his later years. He instructed his younger brother, Hengbo, to write a letter of refusal, saying:

"I have received the Yuan Emperor's salary and title for more than ten years. To betray him and rise up now is disloyal; I am in mourning for my mother and have not yet completed the mourning period. To forget my grief and go out is unfilial."

In the first year of Hongwu in the Ming Dynasty (1368 AD), Emperor Taizu again sent someone to invite him, but Qin still claimed illness and refused to come out. As a result, Emperor Taizu issued a personal edict, saying: "The people of the coastal areas are fond of fighting. Yubo is a man of wisdom and strategy. Now that the world has been settled, he is living in seclusion and refusing to come out. What does he intend to do!" Qin had no choice but to pay his respects and enter the court. However, he firmly refused to take office. On July 20th of the sixth year of Hongwu (August 8, 1373 AD), he passed away in Shanghai at the age of seventy-eight.

From the above deeds, it can be seen that: (1) Qin's ancestral home was Gaoyou, not a native of Shanghai. (2) Qin had "received the Yuan Emperor's salary and title for more than ten years," so he was unwilling to "betray him and rise up" to take office under the Ming Dynasty.

A Confused Record of Famine Relief

As for how Mr. Qin Yubo became the City God of Shanghai County, it is very vague. According to Qin Wenyi, a descendant of Qin Yubo, in the sixth year of Tongzhi (1867), he wrote an "Explanation of the City God of Shanghai County," in which he stated that Qin Yubo died in the sixth year of Hongwu. When this was reported to the court, Emperor Taizu was shocked and saddened, saying: "He would not be my subject in life, but he should defend my land in death. Let him be posthumously enfeoffed as the City God of Shanghai County." He also said many words of praise, and finally said that Qin Yubo becoming the City God of Shanghai was only right.

However, there is no accurate evidence. More reliable is Cao Yishi's "Ode to the City God of Shanghai County," which says: "...The decree of ennoblement as the Earl of Xianyou was made in the first month of the second year of Hongwu. (Note: Emperor Taizu of the Ming Dynasty enfeoffed the City Gods of the capital and the world in the second year of Hongwu. Each prefecture was enfeoffed as a Marquis, and each county was enfeoffed as an Earl.) And Qin became a waiting official from the beginning of this year..."

The problem is here: Qin Yubo's enfeoffment as the City God of Shanghai County was in the second year of Hongwu, but Qin Yubo died in the sixth year of Hongwu. How can someone be enfeoffed as the "City God" before they die? The records of the "Di Cheng Beikao" also say:

"According to research, Qin Yubo was first appointed as a waiting official in the second year of Hongwu...Then who else was in charge before this? The Song Dynasty originally established the City God Temple at Danjing Temple. Did the gods of the Song and Yuan Dynasties replace it after Qin became a god? All of these are incomprehensible."

Therefore, Qin Yubo's position as the City God of Shanghai had become a matter of doubt in the early Qing Dynasty. Moreover, since Qin did not want to be an official of the Ming Dynasty during his lifetime, he probably would not have wanted to be enfeoffed by the Ming Dynasty after his death! However, these are all irrelevant details, just as Qin Wenyi said in his article: "Are all the City Gods in the world like this, and are you only doubting Qin?"

Thus, for more than five hundred years, it has always been "The Qin Family's World."

### Let's Speak of It Casually, Let's Listen to It Casually: Remnants of the Old Dynasty Talk of Spiritual Manifestations

In the legends of the Qing Dynasty, this City God was highly worshiped by ordinary men and women. Even now, you can often hear white-haired remnants of the old dynasty, with their dry tobacco pipes, tirelessly telling young people stories of the "City God's" spiritual manifestations. It is said that in the autumn of the tenth year of Shunzhi, pirates invaded the territory. Wang Jing, the general of Suzhou, failed in his command and was attacked by the people. Just as Governor Zhou Guozhu led troops to Shanghai, Wang Jing was deeply afraid that the people would reveal his failure to flee at the sight of the enemy. He deliberately slandered the people of Shanghai in front of the governor, saying that they were all colluding with the bandits. The governor believed him and agreed to massacre all the residents from Punan to Jing'an Temple. They were prepared to start the next day, but that night, Governor Zhou had a dream. He dreamt that the City God, "wearing a red robe and holding a jade tablet, stood solemnly under the steps, repeatedly shaking his head directly." The next day, Governor Zhou canceled the previous order, and the residents of Shanghai were able to preserve themselves.

Such myths are recorded in great detail in Chu Wenzhou's "Hu Cheng Beikao". For example, during the Kangxi period, a cloth merchant lost money and the City God recovered it through a dream. On another occasion, the grandson of Magistrate Fu was killed by bandits, and the City God also solved the case through a dream. During the Taiping Rebellion, the City God "protected the territory and secured the people" and often "manifested his power," which those who spoke of it made it sound like "documented evidence."

Regardless of how absurd and ridiculous these myths are, after tea and dinner, everyone still uses them as topics of conversation.

The small world of the City God Temple is now also affected by the "trend of the times". The "American-equipped" "World United Commercial Center" has taken away the old-fashioned and antique old toys of the past. (Photo by this newspaper)

### World Student Day Commemoration Held at City Gymnasium Yesterday Morning; 24 Countries' Students Enthusiastically Participated; Beiping Rally Paid Tribute to Allied Leaders and Others by Telegram

[Report from Our Newspaper] After the German army occupied Czechoslovakia during this war, they implemented a campaign of slaughter and arrest to suppress Czech students. From November 17, 1939, they crazily murdered students and professors in Prague and other major Czech cities, with the number of victims reaching thousands. Most students were detained in concentration camps, and all educational institutions were closed. The World Student Congress designated this day (November 17) as World Student Day in 1941. To commemorate this historically moving event, students from various schools in Shanghai held a Shanghai Student Commemoration "World Student Day" assembly at the Shanghai Municipal Gymnasium on Shaanxi Road yesterday morning. Participants included about 5,000 students from 24 countries, including China, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Spain, Hungary, Portugal, Switzerland, Sweden, Greece, India, Denmark, and Italy. The presidium was composed of representatives from five units: Xia Dacheng of Jiaotong University, Zhang Ruoling of Datong University, Wang Chenghan of Minji University, as well as representatives from Jiaotong University and Fudan University. There were also one student representative from each of the five countries of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, France, and Czechoslovakia. Guests included Mayor Wu, Chairman Fang, Director Wu, and presidents of various universities. The venue was decorated solemnly, with national flags of various countries hanging everywhere, and slogans in Chinese, English, French, and Russian posted on the pillars. Behind the grandstand were four giant portraits of the leaders of China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The stage was surrounded by white and red bamboo cloth, with a large Party and national flag and a portrait of the Founding Father as the background. Flower pots were placed in front of the stage, and the flags of 24 countries were inserted on the stage.

Chairman Jiang's Report

The conference began at 9:30 AM. After the presidium took their seats, the police band played music and sang the national anthem. After the formalities, Jiang Yingsheng, a student from Fudan University and chairman of the conference, reported on the significance of the assembly, stating: "The sacrifice of Czech students was worthwhile. Nazism has left the most shameful record in human history. We hope that everyone will not avoid hardships and continue to strive for world peace."

Mayor Wu's Speech

Mayor Wu then delivered a speech: "Today's World Student Day commemoration assembly reminds me of an ancient saying, 'Those who are great should not lose the heart of a child,' because only a young mind is a clean white paper, and once it enters society, it is influenced by the environment. Young people all over the world hope for a happy world, so they must always maintain a pure heart, pursue the truth, and not be used by political parties. Therefore, we must support the National Assembly and hope to change the battlefield into a political arena." Several foreign guests also gave speeches, generally emphasizing international cooperation and world peace.

Chairman Fang's Speech

Later, Chairman Fang of the Municipal Party Committee delivered a speech, stating: "Today's commemoration of World Student Day is worth celebrating! The power of young people all over the world can promote the progress and peace of the world. Young people are the most precious part of the national spirit. Any country without outstanding young students will perish. What we need now is peace, unity, and democracy. But today, if we want to consolidate world peace, we must first seek China's unity, solidarity, peace, and democracy. However, Zhou Enlai, the representative of the Communist Party, said in the newspaper that the Communist Party's survival is won by fighting. Does the world today still need to fight? The Kuomintang convened the National Assembly, hoping to return power to the people, but the Communist Party is preventing it. In the future, I hope that young people can support the National Assembly to seek peace. Whoever destroys peace is our enemy."

Director Wu's Opinion

Finally, Wu Shaoshu, director of the Youth League, expressed three opinions: (1) History tells us that young people are the vanguard against aggression, and we hope that young people can still be the leaders against aggression. (2) Young people are not afraid of sacrifice, so young people are the main force in defending the nation. (3) Anyone who attempts to destroy young people will eventually fail. At the end, the conference passed the "Letter to Young Students Across the Country" and shouted slogans. The conference did not end until after 11:00 AM. After the meeting, a grand parade was held. The procession was led by the Shanghai Municipal Police Band and the Boy Scout Band. Portraits of the four major Allied leaders (China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union) and the flags of the 24 member countries of the United Nations were all displayed. The procession started from the gymnasium on Shaanxi South Road, passed through Central Zheng Road, Tongfu Road, turned into Nanjing Road, and dispersed at the Huangpu Park on the Bund. The "Letter to Young Students Across the Country" passed by the conference is recorded as follows:

Letter to Young Students

Students, today we have once again encountered this tragic commemorative day! Since 1940, every time we encounter November 17th of each year, we cannot help but feel endless grief and indignation. When we recall the cruel and brutal acts of the German fascists and militarists, the destruction of human life, and the attack on world culture, we cannot help but feel righteous indignation and hair-splitting rage. What kind of world is this? What kind of era is this? Who with a conscience can still tolerate it? Who can still sit idly by? Let alone we young students under the world's scientific, cultural, and educational system? Since 1941, we have chosen this day when German aggressors cruelly massacred Czech students and destroyed Czech educational institutions as our common commemorative day, not for any other purpose. We are here to bravely shoulder the task of maintaining peace and protecting culture. We loudly shout slogans such as international cooperation, eliminating aggression, seeking happiness, and promoting culture. We resolutely fight against the flames of fascism and against the toxins of aggression. If we still have work to do, our work is nothing else but anti-aggression and anti-massacre. If our work still has a mission, then our mission is nothing else but for the happiness of mankind and for the culture of the world. Our work will eventually not fail, and our mission will eventually be accomplished. Young students all over the world, participating in the struggle against aggression and massacre, have each demonstrated the highest spirit of sacrifice, and finally defeated our common enemy. From May of last year, the invading militarists collapsed. From September of last year, the Japanese imperialists also perished one after another. Since then, the world has seen the light again, and the times have returned to the right track. For more than a year, the foundation of peace has been consolidated, and the dawn of human happiness has already emerged before our eyes. History has once again proven that "justice" will surely prevail. In the future, mankind should be able to move forward under its call!

But students, we do not shy away from saying that the undercurrent of war has not receded, and international suspicion has not disappeared. Although peace is in hand, cooperation is still difficult to achieve. In such a situation, the conscience of mankind will undoubtedly be subjected to unprecedented trials. How to make unnecessary gaps can be communicated and unwarranted prejudices can be eliminated, which should be the common responsibility of our world students. In order to increase more happiness for mankind and promote the rational development of world culture, we must continue to make positive and constructive efforts based on the past ideas and will of anti-aggression and anti-massacre.

Students, we all believe that international cooperation and consolidating peace are the most important undertakings at present. For the progress of society and the continuation of life, we absolutely do not allow war to happen again. Let us continue to work together for the happiness of mankind and the culture of the world. Justice will surely prevail! Let us all shout slogans together: (1) Students all over the world unite! (2) Consolidate world peace! (3) Strengthen international cooperation! (4) Long live the Republic of China! (5) Long live the United Nations! Initiated by the Shanghai Students Commemorating "World Student Day" Assembly, November 17th.

Beijing Commemorative Meeting

[Report from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 17th] Today, the 17th, is "World Student Day." More than 2,000 students from various schools and representatives of vocational youth groups in Beijing gathered at the Dazhong Theater at 9:30 AM to hold a commemorative meeting. After the music was played and the meeting began, the national anthem of the United Nations was played. Then, Cao Wanru, a female student from Jinling Women's University and chair of the meeting, delivered a speech, elaborating on the origins of World Student Day and stating that young students in the future should have two beliefs: "eliminate war forever" and "promote the spirit of democracy and freedom." Subsequently, students from various schools and the representative of French youth delivered speeches. Li Junlong, director of the Central Propaganda Department of the Youth League, also delivered a speech on the spot, emphasizing the strength of youth power and encouraging students to raise their vigilance, unite with world students, and strive for peace. Finally, the conference passed four telegrams of tribute: to President Chiang, to Czech youth, to the leaders of Fiji, and to the London World Youth Association. The ceremony concluded and adjourned at 10:30 AM.

Mrs. Cripps inquired in detail about the school's teaching situation and was then invited to attend the student welcome rally at the school. The venue was decorated solemnly and quietly, with a red banner with white characters hanging in front of the stage, which read "Welcome Mrs. Cripps" in English. At the beginning of the meeting, Principal Yu spoke about the school's class situation and then stated that most of the school's students are workers who are very concerned about the school. Recently, the school applied to the Executive Yuan for a mobile house, but there were no funds to build it. The school's students are willing to come to the school to build it in their spare time and extend a welcome to Mrs. Cripps.

Inviting Mrs. Cripps to Speak

Subsequently, Mrs. Cripps was invited to speak. Mrs. Cripps briefly stated: "We are very happy to be able to visit here tonight.

I hope you will encourage other friends to come here to study as well. I am especially pleased to know that in addition to studying, you can also help the school build houses. I am very satisfied with the aid to China work. I will return to my country and tell my compatriots that the work during peacetime should be the same as during wartime. I hope it can be promoted and developed. Thank you for your welcome."

### Qingbai Captain's Misconduct; Tung Wah Wins One to Zero; Tung Wah's Performance Excellent in Four Wins; 20,000 Fans at Yiyuan Outraged

[Report from Our Newspaper] In the first-round championship battle of this season's football league, the Tung Wah and Qingbai teams met at Yiyuan yesterday afternoon. Tung Wah, with four wins in four games, defeated Qingbai one to zero, avenging the humiliation of last season's defeat. The first half ended with no score for either side. Yesterday's early winter weather was calm and sunny, and the order among the approximately 20,000 fans was quite good, which was rare and marked the first major event of this season's football matches. Unfortunately, during the second half of the match, Qingbai captain Xu Wenkui's rough behavior aroused great dissatisfaction among the audience, which was deeply regrettable.

Tung Wah Shows Signs of Revival

Tung Wah played very well yesterday, showing signs of revival. The forwards were quite aggressive. Apart from Ade and Sun Jinshun showing their age, the wingers Li Yao and Jia Youliang were very active, especially with Han Longhai. If it weren't for Tai Bao keeping the goal, Qingbai would have been breached long ago. In addition to the forwards, the defenders also worked hard. Zhuang Youren played better than ever before. From the goalkeeper to the center back line, everyone performed their duties properly. Looking back at Qingbai, although Jin Qiuting flew in from Hong Kong, he did nothing yesterday. After Li Yishen and Zhang Banglun collided and were injured in the first half, the forwards became disorganized. However, the defense was very strong, especially Yan Shixin, who stood out. Tai Bao was injured, and Qin Bi Gao was far behind, so yesterday was a match of one attacking and one defending. Tung Wah's victory did not seem accidental.

A-Kui's Rudeness Arouses Public Outrage

Fifteen minutes into the second half, Tung Wah scored a goal against Qingbai, and Li Yangchen and Tai Bao were also injured one after another. The actions of the Qingbai players gradually became rough, and the captain Xu Wenkui deliberately stepped on Zhang Lingen with both feet. Fortunately, he was not seriously injured. The referee, lacking courage, did not impose severe penalties in order to maintain order. The 20,000 spectators were aroused to public outrage and threw orange peels at A-Kui, shouting and expressing great dissatisfaction with Qingbai. Winning or losing is a common occurrence, but for a captain to take such an excessive action is deeply regrettable, especially since the anger of the public is difficult to offend and the sanction of public opinion is to be feared. After the game, the Qingbai players were escorted off the field by the police. Those who lack the spirit and morality of sports are no less than receiving a head-on blow.

Tung Wah Offense Fails to Score

Referee He Chunhui ordered the game to begin. Qingbai kicked off, but was blocked and returned. Tung Wah seized the opportunity to rise and attack strongly. After five minutes, Li Yao hooked the ball, and Longhai shot it over the field. Li Yao shot fiercely twice, but both were caught by Tai Douka. After sixteen minutes, Longhai hammered from twenty yards out, low and fast, but unfortunately hit the crossbar. After that, it was still Tung Wah's world, but they repeatedly attacked without success, to no avail. After 31 minutes, Qingbai attacked. Li Si Kai dribbled the ball quickly, and Banglun rushed out, colliding with Li. Yishen was injured and fell to the ground, leaving the field temporarily. Tung Wah took advantage of the situation to attack fiercely. Youliang took two corner kicks, and the landing points were good. Xiao Li Yao shot cleverly, and Tai Douka lay on the ground and hugged the ball, turning danger into safety. After 39 minutes, Yishen re-entered the field and fought with injuries. Two minutes later, Sun Jinshun kicked hard from a distance, and the ball flew out like an arrow. Tai desperately saved it. Li Yao stepped forward and collided with Tai, causing Tai to injure his foot. Qin Bi Gao came on to replace him. Before long, the first half ended, and the two sides were tied at zero to zero, with nothing gained.

Longhai's Goal Secures Victory

After a rest, the two teams tried again. Tung Wah's A-Dai took a short break, and Huang Kehou took over as the center forward. Qingbai also replaced Li Si Kai with Xue Weitai. After twelve minutes, Sun Lao Jin picked and sent the ball forward, Longhai scurried up, dribbled a few times, and kicked it into the net. Tung Wah opened the scoring, and the audience cheered, firecrackers rang, and the mood was enthusiastic. At the same time, Gao Baozheng left the field due to injury. After that, Qingbai's actions gradually became rough, and Xu Wenkui's deliberate act of stepping on Zhang Lingen caused a loss of sportsmanship, and the audience was in an uproar. Before long, Baozheng recovered from his injury and returned to the field. Qingbai attacked, Xu Wenkui hooked the ball (at this time, A-Kui was filling in as the right winger), and Xue Weitai added a shot, but it was too high, by about a foot, and nothing was gained. In order to strengthen the offensive, Qingbai had a scattered front line and could not reverse the decline. By the time the final whistle sounded, Tung Wah had defeated Qingbai by a score of one to zero.

### Black and White Team's Performance Disappointing; Loses Again to Shan Team Last Night; Black and White Women's Team Beats Xuebai Again

The Black and White basketball team lost to the Shan team by a score of 32 to 26 last night due to Xiao Huatuo's absence. In the first half, Black and White took the lead by one point with a score of 13 to 12. In the women's game, the competition was quite fierce. Xuebai fought hard in the first half, tying with Black and White at 21 each. Unfortunately, they were defeated in the second half due to exhaustion. Both sides performed very well and were worth watching. The final score was 44 to 31, with the Black and White women's team winning. The first quarter ended with no winner at 9 to 9, and the first half ended with 21 points each. Xuebai began to fall behind in the second half. The third quarter ended at 31 to 23, and the final score was 44 to 31. Black and White performed well, and Xuebai's ability to resist fiercely was also unexpected.

The men's game saw both sides adopt the same style, charging wildly without any tactics. The shooting accuracy was poor, with both sides being similar. It was a miracle that no score was recorded for seven minutes, and all points were scored by free throws. It was also a strange occurrence that the Shan team scored three points and the Black and White team scored one point in the first quarter. Afterwards, the scores remained within two or three points of each other, with the first half ending at 13 to 12. The Shan team gradually gained momentum in the second half, with the third quarter ending at 21 to 17, and the final result being 32 to 26. The game lacked excitement, and Black and White's performance was particularly disappointing.

### International Culture and Education New Offerings: A Good Remedy for Ignorance, A Precious Raft for Helping the Distressed

— Special Correspondent for this Newspaper in Paris, Hong Fu

Airmail News from the 6th

Following the Second European War, the United Nations organization emerged, somewhat like the League of Nations after the First European War. It still has the General Assembly and the Security Council, managing important economic and social policies. Underneath it are the Standing Committee and nine directly administered commissions. (1) Economy and Occupation, including four sub-groups: (A) Placement of occupations, (B) Balancing salary and commodity prices, (C) Economic development, (D) Reconstruction of war-torn areas. (2) Transportation and scheduled passenger and freight transport. (3) Collection and publication of statistics. (4) Human rights protection, divided into three subgroups: (A) Freedom of interview and publication, such as allowing foreign journalists to investigate occupied areas of a certain country. (B) Assistance to weak minorities, such as providing joint assistance if a group of people are bullied by the majority because of their language or religion. (C) Prevention of discrimination against certain ethnic groups, such as Jews. (5) Women's issues, such as combating prostitution and promoting women's rights. (6) Social relief work. (7) Curbing opium and narcotics. Its independent agency for negotiation and implementation with the Standing Committee is called the Special Affairs Bureau, now with nine types, of which three have been established: (A) United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). (B) United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). (C) International Labour Organization (ILO). There are six more under preparation: (D) Restoring normalcy and development to international banks. For example, resolving the blocking of foreign assets awaits deliberation by this agency. (E) International Civil Aviation. (F) World Health. (G) International Refugee Relief, which requires a particularly large budget, reportedly 260 trillion US dollars. (H) World Trade Organization.

The United Nations refers generally to the forty-four countries including the US, UK, Russia, China, and France. Terms like "International" and "World" encompass the entire globe without limitation. Following the Paris Peace Conference, UNESCO, the "United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization," which is starting a large-scale publicity campaign through exhibitions, speeches, and films, will convene representatives from forty-four countries in Paris on November 19 of this year. The preparatory office is also stationed in Paris. According to its organizational outline, the Executive Secretary oversees nine divisions: (1) Education Division. (2) Natural Sciences Division, encompassing chemistry, electrical science, biology, meteorology, and other disciplines. (3) Social Sciences Division, encompassing history, international law, and more. (4) Arts Division. (5) Literature and Philosophy Division. (6) Mass Media Division, integrating newspapers, films, and broadcasting for public communication. (7) Libraries, Museums, and Books Division. (8) International Relations Division. (9) War-torn Area Reconstruction Division.

The main tasks of the Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization are threefold: (1) To strive to publicize the details of all cultural endeavors within each country to other nations through the publication of printed materials and the exchange of ideas. This method is most conducive to strengthening understanding between nations and is the beginning of lasting peace. (2) To ensure that healthy people worldwide, regardless of race, gender, status, wealth, or poverty, can receive education and increase their knowledge. If a national government desires foreign assistance, other nations can provide various conveniences. Simultaneously, strive to adopt the best educational methods to ensure that children in all countries possess democratic and free-thinking ideals. (3) To popularize scientific knowledge among people of all sectors using the following three methods: A. Establishing international agreements to properly plan for the protection and preservation of rare and unique art pieces, historical structures, and national treasures. B. By countries cooperating with each other, exchanging scholars, lecturers, books, artistic and scientific items, and all kinds of information. C. Books or exhibitions that are difficult to obtain in one country can be borrowed from other countries at any time. In terms of the assistance provided by various countries to China, the most commendable of the nine divisions of the aforementioned Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization is the Natural Sciences Division. The Sino-British Science Cooperation Office, established in Chongqing in 1942, bore four major missions: One, to complete the liaison between the Chinese government and various European and American academic societies; two, to continuously bring European and American scientific data and information to China; three, to report scientific investigations from China to Europe and America; and four, to contribute knowledge of science and technology to the Chinese and British governments. In these four years, 30 scientific instruments were sent to China by airplane, distributed to 400 experimental units. 200 kinds of English journals were sent, with seven copies each, one original copy, and six microfilm copies that could be enlarged for viewing. 7,000 copies of scientific books. 140 theses were sent from China to the US, published in various Western newspapers and magazines. 100 copies of complete journals and 1,000 books published in China were stored in major libraries. The Cooperative Office also sent specialists to personally visit 300 Chinese educational, scientific, and industrial institutions. The Cooperative Office also facilitated inquiries from the Chinese people and military technical groups, answering hundreds of questions, such as new knowledge related to Aerodynamics for high-altitude long-distance flight, and Isotopicmasses and Insecticides belonging to the chemical department, providing whatever was requested.

Now that Chinese currency is inflating and new Western trends are advancing rapidly, it is very difficult to transfer them to China. Private individuals with ambitions have insufficient funds to purchase expensive European and American newspapers and books. With this cultural and educational organization, and the Sino-British cooperation providing guidance in many ways, and supplying spiritual nourishment, it is truly a good remedy for ignorance and a precious raft for helping the distressed. It is hoped that people with a heart for the country will recruit European and American talents, supplemented by Chinese elders, to further enhance Sino-foreign cooperation, and quickly translate it into Chinese, both to benefit the 400 to 500 million intellectually impoverished people and to provide placement for intellectuals who are beneficial to the country. Urgency is of the essence; the sooner, the better. Otherwise, books left idle for too long will become outdated, and their value will greatly diminish.

### Squatting Movement in Britain

— Special Correspondent for this Newspaper in London, Xue Yan

Airmail News from October 20th

The political situation in Britain is currently not very calm, but because of several problems that are not interconnected but can influence each other, coupled with the participation of political party activists in promoting them, they have stirred up storms and become the focus of attention. Such as the issue of squatting and building houses, Wallace's speech in New York, Stalin's response to questions from a reporter for the British Sunday Times, and the series of demonstrations launched by the Communist Party in response to these issues.

During the war, housing construction almost stopped, and with the bombing by enemy planes, the housing supply was insufficient. Now that the war is over and soldiers have returned, the housing problem remains serious. Furthermore, after this drastic change, many people's occupations have changed, and with the change of occupations, residences have to be relocated, which is normal, but it is also a fact that this has further imbalanced the distribution of housing. As summer ends and winter approaches, people who had been vacationing at the seaside have returned to London for the New Year, and the severity of the housing problem has become more acute. Some poor people, who had been living in houses requisitioned by the government, are now being asked to move out as the requisition period has expired and the government wants to return the houses to their original owners and ask them to move out to find housing. This notice was not sudden; it had been announced a year in advance, but now it has reached the final deadline, so it must be enforced. It is estimated that 1,000 households are actually affected. These 1,000 households protested by marching and demonstrating, and then spontaneously moved into several of the most luxurious hotels before the war, which had been requisitioned by the government as reception centers for foreign guests during the war, but are currently vacant, and are being prepared for return to their original owners for business after repairs. This is the origin of the squatting movement, which is very natural. After this movement occurred, the social response was very good, and many people sympathized with it, believing that it was better to let the poor live in peace than to let the owners get rich. When the first squatters set out, many taxis volunteered to help them move without charging a penny, and many spectators spontaneously donated money for relief, and the amount collected was quite large. Who knew that once this trend started, many dissatisfied people followed suit (there are now similar movements in Canada and France), and dozens of squatting incidents occur every day. The Communist Party saw an opportunity and joined the organization, engaging in planned squatting and launching mass rallies everywhere, using this as a means to attack the government. If this happened in a colony, it would be easy to handle. Just have the police fire a few shots, arrest a few people, or release tear gas, and it could probably be resolved. But here, without a court warrant, the police cannot arrest people, and firing shots or releasing tear gas is unimaginable. The government's countermeasure is simply to cut off the electricity to the occupied houses (but water is still supplied), send police to block the doors of houses that may be occupied, and notify homeless residents to register with the government for allocation of houses requisitioned by the government. Finally, the government collects evidence and files a complaint with the court against the five leaders, accusing them of organizing a group, illegally occupying private property, and disrupting public order. According to reporters who have learned from other sources, the number of people accused by the government and the charges are very light, which is precisely because the government does not have much confidence. Because laws such as organizing a group and disrupting public order are very complicated and can be interpreted in various ways, the court may not accept the case, and the government may not win. The more confident charge is illegally occupying private property, but it seems that the owners should come forward. After two weeks of investigation by the court, it was determined that the government's accusations were true, and five arrest warrants were issued, arresting the five accused. Thus, the government's dignity was protected by the court. Here, what we should pay attention to is not only the actual authority of the court, which is respected by society, but its spiritual authority is especially important. Before the court made a decision, squatting incidents occurred every day, and the government and the Communist Party worked hard to publicize and win social sympathy, so social opinion was not consistent. Some people thought that the Communist Party was deliberately trying to overthrow the government, but others thought that the government had indeed handled the situation abnormally. Once the court's decision was announced, public opinion immediately became consistent, believing that since the court had investigated and found the accusations to be true, the Communist Party was deliberately trying to overthrow the government, and even the Communist Party's newspaper changed its tone. The squatting movement came to an end. But if anyone thinks this is the result of the arrest of five Communist Party members, that is not true, because these five people were bailed out from the beginning, and their actions remained free before the verdict was finalized. The problem is that after the court accepted the case, there was a standard for right and wrong, and society's perspective changed, no longer sympathizing with those who were trying to overthrow the government. Having lost social sympathy, the Communist Party also ceased its activities.

On the day the court announced its decision, many newspapers had headlines saying that the government had won a major victory. However, the Daily Worker, the government party's newspaper, specially emphasized clarification, saying that although the problem of the Communist Party being overthrown had been resolved, the government did not take it as a victory. On the contrary, there were still many people whose housing problems could not be solved, and the government deeply regretted this, fully felt that its responsibility had not been fulfilled, and should redouble its efforts. Then the government announced plans to speed up the completion of housing construction. According to the published goals, by Christmas, more than 430,000 homes would be completed in one district of London, of which more than 180,000 would be permanent homes, and the rest would be temporary homes. According to a government announcement, the above-mentioned houses were planned to start construction before the end of July, and now they are speeding up completion. However, according to the Communist Party, this is the result of the squatting movement, and the government has once again listed the issue of building houses as the top priority in the construction plan.

Government to Speed Up Completion of New Housing Plans Before Christmas

On the international front, former US Secretary of Commerce Wallace's speech in New York, advocating that the United States should cooperate with the Soviet Union instead of being a cat's paw for British imperialism, and Stalin's conversation with a reporter from the British Sunday Times, saying that the UK and the Soviet Union should strengthen political, commercial, and cultural ties. These two closely followed events have had a profound impression in Britain, especially giving the British Communist Party a great impetus. Recently, the Communist Party has repeatedly launched mass rallies and demonstrations, almost all using these two events and the housing problem as propaganda materials. Regarding Wallace's speech, British public opinion initially did not pay much attention to it. The reasons for not paying attention to it were first, Britain knew that the motivation for the speech was for the sake of campaigning. Secondly, judging from the actual environment of the current international situation, it was felt that Wallace's speech was not in line with the facts, because in the current international conferences, US-Soviet conflicts were more frequent than UK-Soviet conflicts. But the consequences caused by this speech have left a deep impression on Britain. President Truman's vacillation seems to the British to be out of line with the demeanor of a statesman. Wallace's eventual resignation is felt to show the strength of anti-Soviet forces in the United States. As for Stalin's answers, not finding an American reporter but finding a British reporter already has a sense of emphasizing Britain over the United States. Furthermore, Stalin's statement that he hoped to strengthen UK-Soviet political, commercial, and cultural ties was seen as evidence that the Soviet Union was willing to deal with socialist Britain. Originally, in Britain, there was also a considerable number of people who had long believed that there were no irreconcilable conflicts between the UK and the Soviet Union. In this world situation of US-Soviet rivalry, Britain might as well step aside and not necessarily be in the middle. This view seems to be even more powerful with the sharpening of the US-Soviet conflict. In this changing international situation, the Communist Party seems to have a sense that "I am not alone." Organizing mass rallies and launching demonstrations are becoming more and more energetic. "Don't let American bankers be the bosses of the world," "UK-Soviet cooperation to stop American capitalists from dominating the world," "The whole world is behind Wallace," etc., are the loudest slogans in Communist propaganda.

### Visiting the National Assembly Representatives of Overseas Chinese from Vietnam and Malaya

— Reporter for this Newspaper, Huang Xingtian

News from Nanjing, 13th

The climate in Nanjing is colder than in Shanghai, almost a month apart in weather, but Mr. Xiang Yutang, the National Assembly representative of overseas Chinese from Saigon, Vietnam, is still wearing a thin white suit, without an overcoat, and still doesn't seem to feel cold. The National Assembly commemorative badge with tricolor ribbons, hanging on his white coat, shines even more brightly.

Xiang Yutang

Mr. Xiang is in his fifties, but he doesn't wear a beard, his vigor is very strong, and he is also very talkative. When the reporter made a friendly visit to him, he told me a lot about Vietnam, past and present. According to him, he was an old comrade of the Father of the Nation during the revolution. At that time, it was forbidden to use the name "Association" in the Nanyang area, so the Father of the Nation established institutions everywhere under the name of "Yixuan Reading Newspaper Society" as a gathering place for promoting revolution and advocating revolution, and "Yixuan" was a transliteration from "Yixian." He became involved in the revolutionary movement in the Yixuan Reading Newspaper Society in Saigon, and even now, although he is the boss of Xiangda Ji and Huaqiang Printing Bureau, he is still responsible for handling the affairs of the Chinese Workers' Union in the Vietnam region, which is more than thirty years.

According to Mr. Xiang, the current situation of French rule in Vietnam is even worse than when our country's land was occupied by the Japanese enemy. For example, Saigon is surrounded by Vietnamese natives and this has been for a long time, and the circle of encirclement is gradually shrinking. When he came, it was only two kilometers from the city. French troops cannot communicate with the outside world, and they dare not go out alone in groups of three or four. As a result, there is a panic about food in the city, which ultimately harms our compatriots. Chinese food shops and rice shops have become targets of robbery, and the situation is very chaotic. The Annamese hate the French very much, but the French still want to alienate the feelings between China and Vietnam, but they have failed. The feelings between the Chinese and Vietnamese people are very good, especially the Annamese have a very good impression of our National Army, and they are friendly like friends.

There is only one thing that Mr. Xiang feels troublesome about, which is that the more chaotic the situation, the greater the power of the Communist Party in Vietnam, and even the General Labor Union has been infiltrated by their traces. But he is still very confident and said: "Now some of the powers have been occupied by some rascals and bad guys due to the chaotic situation, but it doesn't matter, most of them can't do things well. If things are not done well, I can easily change the current evil situation."

As for the situation in the motherland, he said that the general overseas Chinese are very concerned about it, and they hate those who destroy peace and harm the country to the bone, but they sincerely hope that their motherland will stop the civil strife and move towards the road of construction; therefore, they have great expectations for the opening of the National Assembly. As for himself, he believes that

President Chiang will surely follow the Father of the Nation's will and complete the great cause of nation-building, and therefore he always wholeheartedly supports him.

He Ruqun

Mr. He Ruqun, the National Assembly representative of overseas Chinese from Malaya, is the president of the Penang Guangdong and Tingzhou Association and the chairman of the Hakka Association; he also opened a Wanshan Zhan pharmacy on Tianzai Street in Penang, and is a very prominent and prestigious overseas Chinese leader among the overseas Chinese in Malaya. He is also in his forties, his beard and hair are already gray, but his spirit is also very good: he said that the situation of overseas Chinese in Malaya has been affected by the Indonesian independence movement, and their businesses have suffered a lot of losses in various aspects, but the feelings between the Indonesians and the overseas Chinese are also very good, and many overseas Chinese have the greatest sympathy for the fate of Indonesia, and some even sacrifice their property and lives in it. However, their greatest hope is still placed on the motherland, letting the powerful motherland support them in gaining a foothold in the Nanyang area without being despised. Therefore, they also deeply hope for domestic peace, deeply hope for the success of this National Assembly, and deeply hope that the motherland will move towards the road of democratic and strong prosperity.

### Xinjiang Through a Lens (Part 1)

— Originally written by Drake, Special Correspondent for the Los Angeles Times, specially translated by our Editorial Department.

It cannot be said that there have been few foreign journalists who have travelled in Xinjiang in the past four years. However, the author of this article, Drake, is the first. Drake's familiarity with the inside story of Xinjiang is deeper than that of any other journalist. His dispatches consist of six articles, and this is the first, which describes in great detail the political developments and situation in Xinjiang since the Yining rebellion. We have translated it as follows: (Editor)

Does Resources Flow East or West?

Here, in the heart of Central Asia, behind the snow-capped Tianshan Mountains, China is engaged in a valiant struggle for her future security, striving to overcome her formidable geographical difficulties and the constant political and economic pressure from her powerful western neighbours. The reporter believes that developments in the coming months will determine whether the natural resources of the vast Xinjiang province will flow eastward to aid China's revival, or westward to aid the development of Soviet industry.

Today, Xinjiang finds itself in an extremely precarious position, a crisis that is the direct result of the armed Muslim rebellion that began in September 1944 and formally ended on January 2, 1946. The defeat of the Chinese army in this rebellion casts an ominous shadow over the future destiny of Xinjiang.

The rebellion began in the Ili region on the border of the Shanshan Mountains, when several Turkic Uyghur prisoners escaped from the prison in the village of Wulasitai, launching a long-brewing rebellion that quickly spread to the rich Ili, Taiba Jiatai, and Altai regions in northwestern Xinjiang. Yining, a strategic border city in Xinjiang that is now the capital of the rebel government, fell on January 30, 1945, after an eighty-seven-day siege, followed by the massacre of thousands of Chinese residents.

During the siege of Yining, military operations were directed by three Muslim leaders. These three signed a peace treaty with General Zhang Zhizhong, the current chairman of Xinjiang Province, in January and June 6 of this year. All three now hold important positions in both the Xinjiang government and the rebel oligarchy. These three are: Kazimov, 30 years old, a Uyghur, nicknamed "the soul of the Xinjiang people," and currently the Vice Chairman of Xinjiang Province. Kaode Zhafu, 40 years old, a Uyghur political leader. She'er, a Kazakh, who is officially Chairman Zhang's representative in Ili.

After the fall of Yining, the rebels gained new strength, adding modern artillery and bombers bearing the rebel crescent moon emblem to their forces. During the winter advance in the snowy Tianshan Mountains, countless Chinese soldiers froze to death, and many units were largely annihilated by local guerrillas accustomed to the cold climate.

The rebel forces, composed of a mixture of Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and Karluk Mongols, numbered a total of 30,000 and controlled the entire northwestern region of Xinjiang bordering Mongolia by the spring and summer of 1945. They still control this area. They captured the strategic city of Changsu on September 5, 1945, but were later stopped on the banks of the Manas River, 70 miles from Dihua. General Zhang Zhizhong then flew to Dihua, where the Soviet Consul General in Dihua mediated peace talks with the rebels. The victorious Muslims softened their stance, and in January of this year, signed most of the Sino-Uyghur treaty, allowing the Muslims to maintain six regiments of native Muslim troops in the three occupied areas in the northwest under Chairman Zhang.

The final treaty was signed on June 6 of this year and took effect on July 1. The treaty includes a crucial "proviso" that the border area between the rebel-held area and the Soviet Union is to be guarded by troops of the Chinese National Government. However, one year after the start of the peace talks, not a single soldier of the National Government has been stationed on the border with the Soviet Union. The rebel Muslims in the Yining area do not fly the Chinese national flag, but a white flag with a crescent moon emblem, inscribed with the words "People's Republic of East Turkestan" in Turkic. In the streets of Yining, soldiers wearing green uniforms and crescent moon badges can be seen everywhere. In the shops of Yining, Soviet-made clothing, sweets, and movie cameras outnumber similar Chinese goods. The Sino-Soviet Aviation Company's transport planes (American) regularly fly between Yining and Alma-Ata (a modern city in Soviet Kazakhstan, 200 miles west of Yining), on highways that are becoming Soviet-style trucking routes.

The treaty can serve as a means for Xinjiang people to experiment with autonomy, and also as a tool for implementing democracy in mainland China. The treaty grants the people of Xinjiang Province various exceptional privileges, including the right to elect 15 of the 25 members of the provincial government, freedom of speech and assembly, minimum taxation, and freedom of domestic and foreign trade, subject to current Chinese treaties.

Judging from the current situation, China's efforts to obtain oil, coal, gold, tungsten, leather, and grains from northwestern Xinjiang have been frustrated, partly because the Muslim rebels have been slow to implement certain provisions of the treaty. As a result, Dihua and other Chinese-controlled areas in Xinjiang province are mired in terrible inflation and poverty due to a lack of industrial and transportation facilities.

However, it must be said that the Chinese government is probably half responsible for the deplorable economic situation in Xinjiang province, because it has failed to provide Chairman Zhang with sufficient funds to repair necessary roads and provide the economic assistance needed to restore friendly relations between Yining and Dihua.

The reporter is reminded of the same situation that occurred in the Nine Eastern Provinces. Although the actual situation on the southwestern border of Xinjiang is not entirely clear, the aggressive Soviet developers who, with the connivance of the warlord Sheng Shicai before 1944, relentlessly plundered Xinjiang's resources are certainly not accustomed to idleness.

Xinjiang is larger in area than the Nine Eastern Provinces, and its resources and livestock are probably also greater than those of the Nine Eastern Provinces. For China to lose so many resources would be like the United States losing the resources of New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, and Utah.

### Inside and Outside the Factory City (Conclusion)

— Our Special Correspondent Hang Zhou

Jining Snowstorm

Taking the PingSui Railway north from Datong, one enters a silver-white world after leaving the Great Wall. "It's cold!" A soft exclamation emanates from the heart of a visitor from the South. The northerners hear it and smile secretly: "Cold? It's still early! When it's really cold, your outfit will be like summer cloth."

We were very fortunate: we did not experience such weather, but during our few days in Jining, we tasted a bit of it. Jining is the highest point in Suiyuan, 1,400 meters above sea level. It is a second-class county, established not long ago. Before the ninth year of the Republic (1920), it was just a desolate village. Due to the many troubles in the north, this small city was transformed into a strategic point for national defense. General Tang Si Bo once commanded the Battle of Bailingmiao here and built national defense fortifications. After the Japanese army occupied this place, they greatly strengthened the fortifications. After the Communist army came, they rebuilt them again. Therefore, Jining's fortifications are famous in the north.

However, the solid fortifications are not a blessing for Jining. I walked on the snow-covered ground of Jining after the war, like walking in an ancient temple, frighteningly quiet, heartbreakingly dilapidated! Although the war is long over, the atmosphere of war still exists. The shouts of "Password!" emanate from the dark corners at any time, piercing the deathly air, like the howls of wild leopards in the wilderness. It is said that remnants of the Communist army are still scattered in the countryside.

The wind blows gently, blowing like a needle, piercing the bone marrow. The arrival of more than twenty "honored guests" is a major trouble for the welcomers. Most of the reporter group did not bring luggage. Northerners sleep on heated brick beds that are scalding hot, with a coal-burning stove beside them emitting fumes. The windows are tightly closed, not letting in a breath of air. Sleeping on the bed feels like roasting sweet potatoes. The next day, the lips are parched, the tongue is cracked, and the back and waist ache. If you don't want to heat the bed, you must cover yourself with thick quilts. Locals say they only take three baths in their lives: once at birth, once at marriage, and once at death. A piece of clothing is worn from new to tattered without ever being washed. Fleas, if they are considered uncomfortable, are news. Who would have the courage to use a quilt that can be borrowed locally? I had no choice but to borrow a military blanket from Garrison Commander Ju Zhulin, cover myself with a coat, and sleep haphazardly, only to catch a cold the next morning.

The snow stopped on the 6th, but the clouds were still very low. County Magistrate He Fengwu specially mobilized 1,000 civilians to sweep the airfield, but it was all in vain. The Beiping Air Force sent a telegram saying: "The plane cannot land." We were extremely bored trapped in the guest house. When the people of Jining heard that a reporter group had arrived, they came in twos and threes to complain and petition, as if they were treating us as "imperial envoys" or relief commissioners. This one said: "The Eighth Route Army killed my whole family!" That one said: "The Eighth Route Army took away my mule!" Another said: "Sir, my whole family cannot survive!" ... They all started crying as they spoke. We didn't know whether to cry with them or hide, it was very embarrassing.

One Night in GuiSui

It rained again in Jining on the 7th, and we still couldn't leave. GuiSui telegraphed that the weather was better there, so we decided to go to GuiSui to wait for the plane. The car left at 10 pm. The roadbed had just been repaired, and the car moved very slowly. After passing Mount Zhuoxian, the front of the car derailed. Fortunately, it stopped immediately, and a tragic overturning was avoided. We spent an extremely uncomfortable night in the car. The next day, GuiSui sent a car to pick us up. After a delay of eight hours, we finally arrived in the capital of Suiyuan at 5 pm on the 8th.

During the Battle of GuiSui last year, the soldiers and civilians of GuiSui resolutely resisted the Communist army outside the city, preserving its purity. That night, all sectors of the provincial capital held a grand banquet and a wonderful variety show, in addition to welcoming the reporter group, also welcoming several experts from the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission and several foreign missionaries engaged in charity work. At the evening party, Provincial Government Secretary-General Yu Chunzhai, as chairman, delivered a speech saying: "The simultaneous arrival of more than 30 honored guests is an unprecedented event in GuiSui in fifteen years!" His speech included these words: "Remote and desolate Suiyuan is now on the front line of national defense. Due to insufficient material and cultural conditions, this front line needs the attention of the people of the whole country to develop, build, and strengthen it!"

We only stayed in GuiSui for one night. At 9 am on the 9th, we took a plane sent by Beiping back to Datong, transferred to a specially repaired plane for the south, and arrived in Nanjing at 3 pm, ending this journey. (12th)

### The Constitutional Processes of England, America, and France

Newsroom of this Paper

England

The constitution of England can be traced back to the Magna Carta promulgated in 1215, which was produced under pressure from the aristocracy and the citizenry. According to the provisions of the Magna Carta, Parliament was established. Parliament is divided into the House of Lords and the House of Commons. Members of the House of Lords are nobles, large landowners, and court ministers. The House of Commons is organized by representatives of small and medium nobles and commoners. The House of Commons has the power to decide on various taxes, legal systems, and pass tax bills, and its power is greater than that of the House of Lords. This is the beginning of constitutional government in England.

Since the establishment of Parliament, conflicts have repeatedly arisen between the King and Parliament. At that time, England did not have a clear tax system, and the national treasury was not abundant, so the government came up with various new methods of collecting money, requiring Parliament to pass tax increase bills, which affected the interests of taxpayers. Parliament often opposed the government, and the government dissolved Parliament more than once. From the 13th century to the first half of the 17th century, for more than 400 years, the government repeatedly suppressed Parliament, arousing the resentment of the bourgeoisie and the middle class that made up Parliament. In 1628, Parliament presented a Petition of Right to the King. At that time, Charles I, in a hurry to have Parliament pass a new tax bill, had to agree to it. But in less than a year, Parliament was dissolved again. The King acted arbitrarily, levying taxes arbitrarily, which made the people of the whole country dissatisfied, causing the revolution of 1642.

The revolutionary war lasted more than 20 years. It was not until after the restoration of Charles II that the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie divided power and ruled. In 1679, Parliament passed the Habeas Corpus Act, which provided greater certainty for the protection of civil rights than before. After William III ascended the throne, in 1689, Parliament presented a Bill of Rights, which was approved by the King. The King's power was greatly restricted, while the power of Parliament was greatly increased, enough to control the government's policies. From then on, the Conservative Party, representing large landowners and nobles, and the Liberal Party, representing the emerging industrial and commercial middle class, alternately controlled the British government.

In 1701, the Act of Settlement was passed, stipulating the procedures for succession to the throne. In 1911, the Parliament Act was passed again, increasing the power of the House of Commons. Therefore, the British Constitution has fewer written elements and more unwritten elements.

America

On July 4, 1776, the thirteen North American states formally issued a Declaration of Independence, breaking away from Great Britain. At that time, each state had planned to establish a permanent government, but because the military was in progress, there was no time for this, and the states could not trust each other, making it difficult to achieve. It was not until 1777 that representatives of each state negotiated and adopted the "Articles of Confederation". When this plan was submitted to the states for examination and approval, there was a long debate. It was not until 1781 that it was fully passed and implemented.

According to the provisions of the Articles of Confederation, each state retained its sovereignty. The central government only set up a meeting, representing the states, not the people. On the central side, there were no administrative, legislative, and judicial organs to implement the laws decided in the meeting. Each state set up a governor, and the governor's power was very small. Its legislative body also adopted a bicameral system. The right to vote in each state was limited to property owners or taxpayers. After a short period of implementation, it gradually felt unsound.

By 1787, representatives of five states gathered to discuss a plan to reorganize the central government. As a result, a congress was convened to amend the "Articles of Confederation". In May of that year, representatives from each state gathered. This is what is historically known as the Constitutional Convention. After deliberations for four months, and after many fierce debates, the new constitution was produced in September. In 1788, it was agreed and passed by each state. After approval by the statutory number of states, it became the formal constitution of the United States one year later.

The slave system was originally incompatible with the spirit of American independence. The northern states abolished the slave system shortly after independence. However, the southern states believed that it was still needed for maintaining agriculture and retained it. Therefore, conflicts often occurred in Congress between free states and slave states, which finally broke out into the Civil War. In 1865, the Civil War ended. In 1866, the provisions on the rights and interests of the people in the Constitution were amended: all people who are born or naturalized are citizens. White people and slaves can also have the right to participate in politics. In 1869, Congress passed the Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution, stipulating that people of different skin colors shall not be enslaved to deprive them of their rights. This is roughly the process of American constitution-making.

France

France initially had a "Three Estates General," representing the clergy, the nobility, and the bourgeoisie. The third estate, the bourgeoisie, had the largest number of people and the broadest scope. In 1789, when the "Three Estates General" was convened, the third estate used clever means in another venue to invite representatives from the other two estates to engage in election review. However, because the privileged representatives were arrogant and domineering, the meeting was delayed for six weeks and had not yet been held, causing dissatisfaction in the hearts of the representatives of the third estate. Therefore, the National Assembly, representing the French people, was created. This was reorganized from the third estate.

The conflict between the National Assembly and the King led to the French Revolution, and the Declaration of the Rights of Man was issued, indicating that the representatives of the National Assembly had made considerable guarantees for the interests of all citizens. This is an important document in European political history. However, some representatives in the third estate also supported the monarchy. They wanted to establish their new politics on top of a constitutional monarchy. In 1791, a constitution was drafted. But in 1792, the French Republic was finally established in the struggle, and those who advocated a constitutional monarchy were declared defeated. In 1793, the first constitution of the French Republic was produced. Soon this constitution was declared abolished. In 1795, another constitution was promulgated.

After that, France experienced Napoleon's war, the restoration of Louis XVIII, and in 1848, another revolution occurred, and the Third French Republic was established. In that year, the constitution was drawn up, and the president was elected. The new constitution of France was completed again.

During the Second World War, France, under the leadership of General de Gaulle, worked hard to resist Petain's puppet government under the banner of national revival. Soon, the French army returned to the territory of the motherland and established the Fourth French Republic. Feeling that the constitution formulated 50 years ago was no longer applicable, they completed their renewed constitution. This new constitution was promulgated on October 15 of this year.

### Things China Can Make

— Editor

Recently, the Kensington Victoria and Albert Museum in England held an exhibition called "Britain Can Make It." The British King and Queen both visited.

This is similar to the National Goods Exhibition in nature and significance, except that the wording they use is broader and takes pride in what Britain can manufacture.

In fact, in the Chinese industrial world, there is no shortage of warriors who work hard. All products can rival imports and can even replace imports. For example, "MSG" in seasonings can replace imported flavoring powder; "Neo Salvarsan" in medicines can be replaced by "Neo Salvarsan"; "Insulin" can be replaced by "Insulin", etc. These products can be said to be the glory of Chinese industry.

At present, although the new pharmaceutical industry has been severely hit by the dumping of foreign goods, there are still some pharmaceutical factories that are working hard to open up new paths. For example, Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory recently launched "Saint Lucytin New," a special medicine for treating hemophilia and kala-azar; Yang's Chemical Therapy Research Institute launched the amino acid mixture "Ponderon". This kind of action is naturally a way to seek self-survival and technical progress, but the spirit of not being afraid of hardship is worthy of praise.

In the future, the industrial world seems to be able to take "manufacturing things that Chinese people can make to replace imports" as the production policy.

### After Reading This Year's Cotton Production Estimate

— Ji Junmian

This year's cotton production estimate has been released by the Cotton Production Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the National Cotton Textile Industry Federation. Although it is only a preliminary estimate, it may change when the final estimate is made. However, we can see the general situation of cotton production this year from this table.

The figures released this time include twelve provinces, and the more famous cotton-producing areas are already included. It is estimated that there are 34,118,169 mu of cotton fields, producing 7,895,610 dan of cotton. Whether in terms of cotton field area or output, there is a trend of progress, and this progress is not slow. Because the cotton field area has increased by 40% compared with 1945, and it is still 45% worse than 1937. The output has increased by 57%, which is still 38% less than 1937. It is still a very gratifying thing.

This remarkable achievement is due to the efforts of all parties to promote and popularize it. It is also due to the eight years of enemy and puppet invasion, during which the people lived a hard life and lacked clothing. Once the sky was clear again, the demand for clothing was very strong and urgent, which increased the interest of cotton farmers in planting cotton. Moreover, the weather this year has not changed significantly. Although the report mentions "unfavorable weather," it is actually only local, and the disaster is light. Based on the above three factors, the increased numbers had a greater possibility, but the reasons that "fires of war were everywhere, food was lacking, and cotton farmers were unwilling to plant more cotton; and traffic was blocked, production costs were high, and production and sales were not on the right track" limited them. From these figures, we also get a slight hint - the seven provinces in East China seem to be slightly more stable than North China (only comparatively stable), so the increase in production is also greater in East China than in North China.

Although cotton production has increased this year, it is expected that part of it will be for the farmers' own consumption, and most of it cannot be absorbed by factories as raw materials. With foreign cotton pouring in, everyone is looking forward to the day when domestic cotton is self-sufficient, but the difference is still very far! Even if we take a step back, if we estimate the consumption of raw cotton per spindle per day and night for spinning "20-count yarn" at 1.177 pounds, then the monthly consumption is estimated at 5,707,630 pounds based on the existing number of spindles, which is 51,796 metric tons. If we calculate the number of working days in three shifts per year, we need 15,839,024 metric tons." According to this calculation, the difference between production and sales is 900,000 metric tons, only 100,000 metric tons less than last year, not to mention the consumption in the producing areas and the poor quality that does not meet the requirements for factory raw materials!

Assuming that the general demand for clothing this year has been initially satisfied, and the price of cotton this year cannot be in normal proportion to other grain prices, then the increase in production next year will not necessarily be smooth.

After reading this report and looking at the surrounding environment, we really have mixed feelings of joy and fear.

### The Export Problem of Chinese Products

— Shadow Staid

The current high production costs in China are due to many factors. Inconvenient transportation and unresolved political issues all impact the export of domestic goods. The Chinese industry does not face the problem of high worker wages, yet its production costs are higher than those of other countries. This is because, for the same type of goods, the number of skilled workers used in manufacturing in China is fewer than in other countries. According to statistics before the war, the proportion of workers needed to spin 20-count yarn with 1,000 spindles was 6 in Lancashire, 6.1 in the United States, 9.3 in Japan, and 9.9 in China. For spinning 30-count yarn, it was 4 in Lancashire, 8 in Japan, and 8.5 in China. This shows that the labor cost for the same product in China is already double that of overseas. Japan's ability to compete overseas is due to the cooperation between banks, transportation companies, and yarn factories, and the slave-like work of its laborers. These are all lacking in China.

Therefore, if China wants to regain its pre-war overseas markets, it must train skilled workers and reduce living standards to lower production costs. The transportation problem must also be addressed to make it more efficient and convenient. The current problem of continuous inflation in China is particularly peculiar, as not only the currencies of small countries are inflating, but also the US dollar is inflating in China. This is because the prices of the two currencies fluctuate, which is an attempt to find a solution to economic problems. However, the only good policy is to improve China's foreign trade. Although many substitutes compete with Chinese goods, the prospect of exporting Chinese goods is not hopeless. First, the quality of goods must be improved. Sometimes, when Chinese goods are compared with products from other countries overseas, the difference lies not in the price but in the slight difference in quality. As for the transportation problem, the temporary suspension of some shipping routes operated by foreign merchants is due to political rather than economic reasons. China's industrial and commercial circles can wait one or two years, and things will improve.

In addition, the most difficult problem for China's industrial and commercial circles is the instability of the currency. The currency is constantly devaluing, making it impossible for merchants to estimate costs. This is even the case with US dollars, as the price of US dollars also fluctuates. The high trade deficit of China's foreign trade and the recent decrease in foreign tourists are also factors. In the past, they could spend a lot of money in China. Due to the current unstable political situation and inconvenient transportation, foreigners are hesitant to come to China. In any case, the obstacles to business in China today are often more political than economic. Post-war China's ability to achieve such a position in the international arena is often beyond what was imagined. Its position in world politics is particularly important. The world needs the Chinese market, and China's need for the world market is even more pressing. In the 20th century, no country can be isolated. Even the Soviet Union, whose economic structure is completely different from other countries, cannot be isolated and is trying to gain a global market. The same goes for other countries.

### Strange News of Production

— Shao Biao

Twenty-five years ago, soybeans were still unknown in the West. Now, they are not only recognized as the most nutritious food in nature but also used as an industrial raw material.

The United States now uses soybeans to manufacture insecticides, printing inks, waterproof materials, and compounds such as oilcloth. The Ford Motor Company has even built a prototype car with most of its body made from soybean raw materials.

General Electric in the United States has newly invented an automatic electric temperature blanket. Two very fine electrical strips are installed in a double layer of wool. One current generates heat to warm the blanket, while the other strip measures the blanket's temperature and is connected to a three-light electronic controller, which can adjust the temperature to suit the room temperature. This type of blanket is very light and is now being mass-produced, with a price of approximately US$40 per blanket.

### Reasons for the Development of Industrial Technology

— Xue Peng

The development of modern technology cannot be attributed solely to the fact that modern technology is based on scientific knowledge, but also to the respect, welcome, and reward that modern society gives to technology.

(1) The scientific nature of modern technology can have the following effects: A. The knowledge of technology can be easily objectified, promoting its movement and popularization. B. The knowledge of technology can be systematized, and the general causal relationship can be explored. Solving one problem becomes the key to solving other problems, and at the same time, it raises other new questions, making it easier to carry out research and development.

(2) Modern society welcomes and rewards technological inventions. Modern social trends are greatly interested in the development of material technology. Therefore, technological inventions and improvements are highly respected and welcomed. Those who study technology are never oppressed by society, and anyone has the freedom to research. Breaking the shackles of feudalism, establishing industrial freedom. Under the competitive system, in order to overcome its competitors, to obtain special profits, and to open up new sectors, entrepreneurs are actively welcoming and expecting new technological inventions. The most obvious manifestations are: A. Various technical education institutions, public technical research institutions, etc. B. Various research institutions and investigation and promotion institutions established by large enterprises or economic groups, etc.

However, under today's highly monopolized organizations, the desire for profit is often achieved by easier methods than technological improvement, that is, the welcome and encouragement of technology often slackens with the degradation of the competitive role. This is also a phenomenon that can be noted.

### An Introduction to Business Management

— Xu Baiyi

Employee Psychology

(1) Honesty

In a business organization, honesty can be said to be the rejection of all external temptations and the avoidance of any actions that are harmful to the business organization, such as negligence in doing things or failing to report broken items.

Testing method: We can ask him for his opinion on various actions, for example:

A. When we are sitting on the tram and want to avoid paying for the ticket, just reading the newspaper, and the ticket seller is successfully fooled by us, is this action good or bad?

B. Within the company's working hours, ostensibly doing things, but in reality, deliberately slowing down the progress of work, is this action good?

(2) Loyalty The explanation of loyalty is very similar to honesty. The outline of a business organization for its employees is to generate labor equal to the price paid. Because laziness or wasting time is certainly not good, but extra and free work is also not required by a business organization. A staff member who can work loyally should receive a reward of promotion or salary increase.

Testing method: You can get his criticism of the places he has worked before by asking questions (if it is an employee who has never worked before, you can ask him how he intends to work hard or what kind of interest he feels in a certain industry)

Regarding the point of loyalty, on the one hand, it is still necessary to tell the employees about the various situations of the business organization at any time, such as the difficulties during the initial business, the past history, etc., verbally or in print, so that the employees can generate faith in the business organization and feel that working in it is very hopeful.

(3) Concentration

Concentration is very necessary in doing various tasks. If you do not concentrate your attention, you cannot solve the problem. When doing fine work, if you do not concentrate your attention, it is easy to make the goods substandard.

Testing method: Give the employees a few questions to solve. I can give a small problem published in the family as an example:

When Mr. Jing was about to leave Shanghai, he forgot to leave the key to the post office box. Mrs. Jing asked him for it, and he mailed it, but after a few days, Mrs. Jing asked for it again. Why is this? (Because the key mailed is still in the mailbox)

(4) Cooperation with colleagues

In many factories, the production of a product cannot be done by one person alone. It must be done by the joint cooperation of several workers. If the work of one person is not up to standard, it will be affected. Therefore, the cooperation between the various workers is very important.

Testing method: You can examine the previous work performance, or use the oral test method to inquire about the difficulties when working in other factories before, or why you want to leave that factory. If he says that some people could not cooperate with him before, or how others were not good, if there is this situation, then he will definitely still have that situation.

(5) Ambition

Ambition is needed by everyone. If you ask him what work he has done in order to seek his own advancement, most people will answer you that he has not done anything. This kind of person will never make progress.

Testing method: You can add the following questions to the form:

A. What do you do for entertainment in your spare time?

B. What books do you read in your spare time?

C. In which aspect are you going to work hard in the future?

Chun Qiu (Spring and Autumn)

### Preface to "Professor's Family"

— Hong Shen

On a cold and gloomy morning in December 1943, when I was beginning to rehearse Song Zhi's play "Spring Chill" at the China Arts Theater in Chongqing, a thin, lanky young man with very limited mobility, came into the "Central Arts" rehearsal room with a letter in his hand. I saw from the letter that it was from Ma Yanxiang, requesting that I grant this author of "Professor's Family," whom I had met several times at the Youth Theater, permission to observe the rehearsals of "Spring Chill." I immediately granted permission and continued my rehearsal work.

At that time, Chongqing actors were becoming professionalized. They performed on stage in the evening, returned to the company at twelve o'clock for a midnight snack, or played a few rounds of "sand crabs," so when the "Spring Chill" rehearsal started at ten o'clock the next morning, Wang Jun was already there, while the actors were always late. Later, the rehearsal venue was changed to the Chongqing Youth Hall and then to the Yin Society at the entrance of Daomen. Although the actors' lateness improved, the taciturn Wang Jun always came on time to watch me rehearse. Because the actors were not punctual, while waiting for them, Wang Jun would talk to me about Chinese and Western drama, old plays and spoken drama, stage experience and playwriting, etc. From these conversations, I learned that he had a considerable understanding of the history of Chinese and Western drama and the evolution of Chinese old plays into spoken drama. Secondly, I knew that he wanted to go to France for further study, specializing in playwriting. At that time, I was teaching at Fudan University and had to go to the city to rehearse, and my friends were urging me to write "Fifty Years of Chinese Drama." Therefore, I entrusted Wang Jun to collect materials for this article. At that time, the "New Art Series" play collection that I was eagerly seeking (containing my long preface) was obtained by Wang Jun.

Soon after "Spring Chill" was staged, I received Wang Jun's long "Spring Chill Performance Record" of over thirty thousand words, and two plays. One was the three-act comedy "Jian Fei's Courtship," which depicted a one-armed young military officer who had won the love of a mine owner's daughter. The father always tried to obstruct them in every way, but the military officer was not discouraged and tried every means to help the mine owner solve a sabotage case, protect the mine owner's life, and eliminate the danger of sabotage, finally obtaining the mine owner's permission to marry his daughter. This is a very interesting comedy, and the author admitted that he was greatly influenced by the 17th-century British comedy writer Sheridan. The other was the one-act play "Night Scene on the Sichuan River," which depicted the story of an old woman, Zhao Dama, who selflessly rescued an abandoned child during the westward evacuation of civilians during the Anti-Japanese War. This play focuses on the rendering of the atmosphere, and from this, I knew that the author had put a lot of effort into studying the symbolist master Maeterlinck.

In addition, during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the author also wrote "When Father and Son Meet," "Professor's Family," and "Apology." "When Father and Son Meet" is the sequel to "Night Scene on the Sichuan River." When the abandoned child met his father, who was wounded in an air raid, in a Chongqing hospital, he himself was seriously ill due to malnutrition in the orphanage, and was about to die and be tragically separated from his father, along with his mother, who died of miscarriage on the boat, both victims of the enemy's invasion. "Professor's Family" attempts to portray the human habit of "the mountain is always greener on the other side of the hill" - Professor Zeng XianGuang is honest and studious, and marries Bai Yunshang, a high-status, sociable woman who does not want to be lonely. Because they do not share the same interests, XianGuang falls in love with his like-minded female teaching assistant, Ye Jinbo. Yunshang is looking for a new love with her old friend, the musician Guo Xiaocun, but Xiaocun also suspects Yunshang is having an affair with the auction house boss. When Zeng and Ye get together, and Ye is a little impatient with the research environment in the countryside, the entertainment between Bai and Guo is eliminated. The play ends with the marriage of two new couples. This three-act, one-scene play has a rather tight structure and seems to be greatly influenced by French plays. "Apology" is an interesting farce, but in terms of the profound description of the personality of the protagonist Wu Rongzhao, etc., it can also be regarded as a comedy. This play takes Chinese family education as its theme. Landlord Wu Rongzhao is tyrannical and oppressive to the farmhands and poor farmers, but flattering to his only son, apologizing whenever he is slightly disrespectful. In the end, he still cannot stop his infatuated son from going up the mountain to seek immortality.

Looking at the five plays in total, three comedies and two tragedies, the theme gradually tends to be profound, the characters gradually become clear, the dialogue gradually becomes vivid, and the structure gradually becomes tight. I usually advise young writers to write more comedies when starting out, because masterpieces are generally not achieved by luck. Generally speaking, comedy is more difficult than tragedy. Understanding the methods of obtaining comedic effects makes it easier to handle any play in the future. The more important of Wang Jun's five plays are all comedies, and the better ones are also comedies, which shows that the direction he is walking is correct. Judging from his cultivation of drama, his foundation is also solid. If he continues to work hard, his future is unlimited.

This time, "Spring Chill" is being performed again in Shanghai. With a happy mood, I would like to recommend these five plays of the author to my country's theater and the general public, although some of these plays have already met with audiences in the Great Rear Area.

### Poetic Words

If it is poetry, no matter what form it is written in, it is poetry; if it is not poetry, no matter what form it is written in, it is not poetry.

Poets are loyal to their own experiences and do not write anything other than their own feelings, while those who write poetry are only arranging sentences into lines.

——The distinction of poets is the strictest.

### The Pen Nib – In Memory of a Friend's Death

— Bao Yu

Whenever I see the stiff nib of a fountain pen, I immediately think of the death of a friend.

When I was editing a mimeographed newspaper on the guerrilla-held isolated island occupied by the enemy puppets, I met a colleague. His surname was Huang, he was from Shandong, and we usually called him "Little Huang" or "Little Country Bumpkin". He was very short, with a pair of black and large eyes. When he wrote articles, he always used the old Parker fountain pen he carried with him, writing and biting his fingernails at the same time. Every one of his fingers was bald and sharp, but he kept on biting, as if the inspiration for his writing was hidden in the crevices of his fingernails.

The newspaper was published every three days, mimeographed but printed with lead. There were only five colleagues working in the newspaper office. Although their duties were different at ordinary times, when working, they were willing to do whatever they could; especially Little Huang, in addition to assisting in editing news and writing articles, he could also receive radio broadcasts, write stencils, and sometimes even pick up a mimeograph roller to print.

After the newspaper was printed, in addition to being distributed to readers on the isolated island, it was also transmitted to the enemy-occupied areas by various means. One day, our newspaper actually appeared on the walls of the enemy stronghold, so the enemy and puppet troops in the entire stronghold were alarmed and uneasy. When this news reached our ears, it was like receiving the highest reward. Immediately, Little Huang composed a song. I still remember a few lines in it: "No need for pistols or bombs, only iron pens and steel stencils, no need for 'Thompson' or 'Type 38', only mimeographs and meter sticks, launch a cultural blitz, attack the enemy's hearts and livers!"

Several people each held a weapon - an iron pen, a meter stick, a mimeograph roller,... Little Huang held his Parker pen, which he never left his side. While holding the weapons, they sang, and later, the ink stained everyone's hands, noses, and faces. They looked at each other and laughed wildly.

But our newspaper only published seventy issues before it was attacked by the enemy - the enemy went to the countryside to sweep. Our village was surrounded for three days. Because of the problem of food and ammunition, we had to break through with the defending soldiers on a dark moonless night.

In the intense fire, three of our five colleagues broke out. One was killed halfway through; one was missing. The one who went missing was none other than Little Huang.

The enemy's sweep, like spilled alcohol on a tabletop, burned fiercely for a while and quickly went out. We still returned to the original location. The village had been destroyed, and half of the houses in the village had been burned down. The thatched hut used by the newspaper office was completely destroyed. But we had no time to mourn, because at that time, the most important thing was to find Little Huang. We split up to find him and found many bodies of people who had been harmed by the enemy, but Little Huang was not among them. Finally, next to a pile of straw in a half-open shed, we found his body lying on its back. His face fully expressed hatred. There were no wounds on his body, only his throat had rotted away, with a deep hole in it, but it could be seen that it was not a knife wound. A right hand without fingernails was clutching the Parker pen he was accustomed to using. The pen barrel was gone, and the tip of the pen had become rake-shaped. Blood stained his pen nib and pen barrel, his hand and body.

Isn't it obvious? Because he had not broken through the fire, he hid in the half-open shed. Later, the enemy rushed in. In order not to be taken prisoner, he used his great weapon - the Parker pen nib - to break his own throat and sacrifice himself heroically.

Our speculation was not wrong at all. This pen was his battle companion. He used his pen to tell the suffering of the people; he used his pen to expose the atrocities of the enemy; he used his pen to carry out a cultural blitz; and finally, he also used his pen to dip into the blood that gushed out of his throat to complete a great poem...

Little Huang was buried, and this pen was also buried with him. - Only he is worthy of using this pen!

From then on, whenever I see the stiff nib of a fountain pen, I think of Little Huang's death, and at the same time, I seem to see the congealed blood stains on the pen nib shining.

### American Modern Playwright Eugene O'Neill

— Cai Xue

After twelve years of silence, Eugene O'Neill has a new work coming out. "The Iceman Cometh" was started before the war and will be released soon. This is a four-act play, containing nineteen characters, and must be performed for at least four hours, only half an hour shorter than his two most famous plays. The length is not a problem in his view. "As long as it's not too short to be tasteless, and not too long to be annoying," he replied. In addition to "The Iceman Cometh", he has written two new plays that have not yet been released.

In 1931, he took his family to the West Coast, where he lived for more than ten years, until recently, when he returned to New York. This time, he sold all his furniture and brought only some books and antiques.

He is thin and tall, dressed very exquisitely, with shining hair, and seems a little shy between his movements. However, his eyes are bright and shining. His conversation is sometimes melancholic, and sometimes interspersed with humor.

His father was the famous John O'Neill. He used to travel around with his father. He often remembers his father's words: "The drama scene now is too lifeless." Indeed, in his father's time, the characters in the play were either good or bad, with clear boundaries. "Now, when reviewing scripts," he said, "they are still inheriting this old concept, which can hinder artistic progress. What they care about is whether it will teach six or seven-year-old children badly. How do they know that there are several people among six or seven-year-old children who can teach us badly? Once, my script was seized by those review committee members, but unexpectedly, the sales of tickets greatly increased. However, those who came to see it were still irrelevant people, mostly disappointed, because this script was not as bad as they imagined."

He also hates the bosses in the theaters, who are unwilling to try anything more novel and only stage scripts that made money ten years ago, daring not to take risks. He believes that only those who are willing to write new scripts will study new art. After new art becomes a fashion, it will inevitably decline after reaching its peak, Impressionism being one example. The reason why "fashion" is annoying is that people who do not understand art also pretend to be artists. This is not only true of drama, but also of other kinds of art. Drama, like painting and music, has certain rules. Only those who can truly understand these rules can break them.

He believes that movies are harmful to drama. Hollywood has snatched away all the people who can act. Playwrights, wanting Hollywood to buy their scripts, inevitably cater too much to their tastes. He said he is not against movies and likes to watch them very much. But when writing a script, one must never intend to leave room for future adaptation into a movie. Writing a script and writing a movie are two different arts. Adapting a play into a movie is the business of filmmakers, not playwrights.

Radio also has its scope and does not need to be mixed with drama.

O'Neill was born in New York and is now fifty-eight years old. He entered school at the age of seven and was expelled from Princeton University for misconduct. He wandered around South and North America, and his accomplishments were nothing. Finally, he returned to New York and acted with his father. Because of his poor health, he went to a hospital to recuperate. He began to write scripts out of loneliness and boredom and became famous for it.

He said that he is most afraid of watching the scripts he has written himself. The actors often cannot express what he has in mind, even going in the opposite direction. Only Charles. Corbin's portrayal of Minter in "King John" could meet his intention.

After the outbreak of the war, because the outside world was too disturbed, he could not concentrate on writing. He does not use a typewriter and does not like dictation, so the manuscripts are all handwritten.

### Impromptu Gift to Ms. Xie Bingying at the Literary Tea Party · Respectfully Presented to Mr. Jin Shanshen for His Correction

— First Draft by Jin Donglei

A hall filled with a gathering of heroes,

Gladly, there is a female hero in the army,

I am frustrated by my lack of talent, unable to form a verse;

Both literary and martial, her pen flies freely.

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of Blood 96

— Ye Jingfeng

"Could it be that the powder magazine was blown up?" Tiger Brother guessed.

"Powder magazine?" I recalled the situation in the gasoline tank area. "That's unlikely. The oil drums and tank were separated from the powder magazine by six or seven zhang." I tried my best to consider the possibility of this matter.

"If not, could it be that the Japanese devils used bombs to extinguish the fire?" Tiger Brother applied his highest knowledge and intelligence to make a second guess.

"Even more unlikely..." I explained, "Using bombs to extinguish a fire is also a possible method, but judging from the sound, this bomb was at least one or two thousand pounds, or even more. When it exploded, even places several miles away here felt the tremors... I'm afraid they don't have such a big bomb here."... (The reporter's recollection of the group's report ends here).

As Qun finished speaking, I (the reporter) interjected, telling those present, "This matter will never be truly understood. But I do have a guess: I think it was a landmine that the Japanese devils had buried underground beforehand that exploded. I know that in some important areas, they often bury landmines in advance. Once they suffer a defeat and don't have time to transport important materials away, they use electricity to detonate the landmines to destroy the things. Foreigners also have this habit. I just don't know if this explosion was caused by the gasoline fire being too strong and detonating the landmine, or if they detonated it themselves with electricity. This can only remain a secret forever."

I also asked Qun and Little Tiger how they came back. Yaoqun said that when they reached the section near where Sister Cui lived, it was already past eleven o'clock. They found the car they had hidden. Because of the Shuanglong incident, there were too many Japanese devil sentry cars on the highway searching back and forth, so they dared not take to the road. They hid in the fields and waited for more than half an hour before driving back.

While we listened to Yaoqun telling this story, we continued to receive reports of battles on the front lines. The situation at various positions of our army was bad. In Tong County, there were only a little over a thousand "Security Team" members, and two or three battalions of undisciplined puppet troops. How could they possibly hold out? At the same time, we also received an order from the Beiping Action Headquarters to evacuate urgently, so the temporary commander here immediately ordered all comrades to prepare for evacuation and post-evacuation work.

I also told Yaoqun and Hucheng about Hejian calling me, asking me to move the secretariat to Shanxi, and then asking me to rush to Tokyo. When the two of them heard this, Hucheng's big, round eyes immediately shone with a strange light, as if eager to try it out, while Yaoqun lowered his head, with a look of deep melancholy and sadness.

When our group left the city, the south of the city was already ablaze with fire. The Japanese devils had launched a major counterattack and were advancing into the city. It seemed that the mountains and rivers that these thousands of brave soldiers had shed blood to recapture would once again fall into the hands of the enemy. The streets along the way were silent as death. Under the dim and unclear lamplight, the flags of the Blue Sky with a White Sun still hung in front of every house. Perhaps the tens of thousands of pure and kind people were still celebrating the restoration of their motherland in their dreams! (End of Chapter 5)

### U.S. Dollars

— Shaofu

Every time there is a political change, the financial market in Shanghai becomes very sensitive and stirs up trouble. This time, the wild jump in the U.S. dollar was not due to rumors in this regard, but due to the absurd rumors that foreign exchange would be loosened. It must be said that speculators' ability to use market psychology to fabricate stories is very clever and impressive.

On the surface, we who do not have U.S. dollars in hand and do not use U.S. dollars do not seem to have much to do with its rise and fall; however, in reality, it is closely related to other commodity prices (for example, this time the U.S. dollar rose, and the price of gold also rose accordingly), and we who do not have Citibank tickets are completely harmed by it.

The sky is covered with layers of gray clouds, and in the north wind, we hear the two-person band hired by some shops playing. The monotonous music makes people feel very sad. This is a symbol. Industry and commerce are currently at the most difficult juncture, and they really can't stand the stimulus of any disturbance.

Speaking of U.S. dollars, it is said that the United States prints an average of 35 million U.S. dollars in banknotes every day. The smallest denomination is one dollar, and the largest denomination is one hundred thousand dollars. The banknote printing company is located in Washington, D.C., and has a staff of 7,000 people. The raw material for banknote paper is 50% cloth and 50% cotton. Regarding this point, I wonder if friends who do U.S. dollar business know about it?

### Nutrition Expert

— Suobei

Character Sketch

The "nutrition expert" claims to be "naturally deficient and acquiredly imbalanced", so he is sallow and emaciated, and his mind and body are exhausted. Recently, he has been losing sleep every night due to worrying about the country and lamenting the times. Under such circumstances, he feels that his health is too bad; therefore, he tells everyone he meets: "My body is about to collapse!"

Just like the doctor in "Chongqing Twenty-Four Hours" (a famous anti-Japanese war drama) said: "The body is too bad, the nutrition is too poor!" This "nutrition expert" imitates those two lines whenever he meets someone.

Very few people know the original name of "Nutrition Expert" (as we call him). Long before victory, we gave him the "elegant name" of "Nutrition Expert" by common consent. He really knows too much about nutrition. He spends all day holding books such as "Vitamins and Nutrition", and even when eating a peanut, he makes a big fuss, saying that the peanut skin is rich in nutritional value and should not be discarded; however, other people eat peanuts without any problems, but as soon as he eats peanuts, he immediately gets stomachaches, intestinal noises, and all kinds of diseases.

He has two thermometers, one for measuring the climate and one for measuring body temperature. When looking at the climate thermometer, he advocates opening windows or not and covering himself with how many quilts, and must first look at the indoor thermometer before deciding; he also decides how many clothes to wear in the morning in this way. Occasionally, he feels abnormal, and he must drink a lot of boiled water and sit quietly to rest, but sitting quietly and contemplating only increases his mental anxiety. Therefore, he always feels that the discomfort in his body is becoming more and more serious; he immediately looks in the mirror again, counts his pulse, and suddenly feels that a serious illness is coming. He feels that he must have an X-ray and a blood test, so he immediately runs to the doctor. The doctor knows that he is a "mechanical hygienist" and can only lightly give him some digestive medicine and tell him to exercise more, but he says: "Someone as weak as me can only take a walk and should not do strenuous exercise!" The doctor smiles helplessly.

When he returns home, he feels that the doctor is too irresponsible. He looks in the mirror again and suddenly feels that his complexion has improved, with a slight red glow in the pale white, but then he thinks again! No, that's probably a fever. Isn't it exactly one o'clock in the afternoon on the clock? It's probably the early stage of TB and he's having a "Noon-Fever". He feels infinite sadness, as if nothing in the world belongs to him. He mutters to himself: "I should get a calcium shot, I should eat more of the best cod liver oil pills. So he took out a "Haivita" pill from his pocket, then breathed fresh air in front of the window and rested for a few minutes. He suddenly felt better and coughed up some phlegm. After examining it carefully, he found no blood streaks in the phlegm, and his nerves gradually calmed down.

In the evening, he designs: What kind of dinner is the most perfect "vitamin" meal in the world? He tells the nanny: "You must put some tomatoes, cream, pig liver... in every bowl of vegetables, and it can't be too cooked, otherwise, the vitamins will be burned to death! However, the bacteria in the vegetables must be killed!" This makes the nanny, who has not received "nutrition and health education", completely confused. After dinner is served, he doesn't want to eat it, probably because the "Halivita" cod liver oil pill is too strong and can't be digested; this makes him even more panic. He flips through the book "Ways to Maintain Health", which says that vitamins B and C help digestion, so he decides to inject vitamins B and C again.

He talks about nutrition every day and pays attention to health all the time, but the result is that he has "no way to make a living" and "no way to treat illness". Mr. "Nutrition Expert" frowns at the mirror, and the doctor shakes his head with a smile.

Childishness and hypersensitivity have destroyed the health of the nutrition expert!

### Many Tricks of Swindlers

— Xiuju

Now there are endless scams in Shanghai, which are really increasing. If you are not careful, you will be greatly fooled. The other day was my brother's wedding day, held at the Kangle Restaurant, with guests filling the hall, a harmonious and lively atmosphere. Yesterday, all the congratulatory gifts from the guests, including cash, gift certificates, and bank drafts, were sent to Shanghai ×× Bank, but two of the ×× Qianzhuang 50,000 yuan bank drafts, signed ×××, were returned. Everyone was very surprised and hurriedly flipped through the gift register, which showed that Mr. Huang ×× had sent a bank draft for 100,000 yuan. My father immediately became suspicious, saying that he had no contact with Mr. Huang ×× and did not know him, so he immediately realized that this person must have sent it when the wedding ceremony was held at Kangle Restaurant, while the host, the groom, and the bride were entering the hall. Because at that time, all the hosts and managers were surrounding the stage in the main hall watching the wedding ceremony, and there were several managers and the like left at the accounting table. Because this person used the name of Mr. Huang ××, the manager thought that my father had contact with Mr. Huang, so he issued a 10,000 yuan tip without thinking. Who knew that this draft was an expired draft from the pseudo-organization? This person waits every day for weddings to be held in larger halls, then sends tens of thousands of yuan of fake drafts as congratulatory gifts, and can collect tens of thousands of yuan in tips in a day, which is much easier than borrowing or begging from people! But the swindled people are greatly troubled by it. Therefore, gentlemen who hold happy events in the future, especially the managers sitting at the accounting table, please pay special attention and do not let these cheaters be complacent again.

### Impossible to Go to Bed Early

— Jianhua

At the Shanghai Municipal All Circles Economy Movement Committee, during the standing committee meeting the day before yesterday, Mayor Wu suggested that everyone go to bed early and get up early to save electricity. The benefits of going to bed early and getting up early have been explained in detail by educators and health experts, and are known to women and children, so there is no need for lengthy descriptions here.

However, the night in the city does not allow citizens to go to bed early. The staff in the newspaper offices, of course, cannot go to bed early; the teachers in the schools, in order to grade papers and prepare teaching materials, are afraid that it is also difficult to go to bed early; even the important officials in politics, because of indispensable banquets and social engagements, or consultations on important matters, have to sacrifice their early bedtime to deal with a late night.

Speaking of the industrial and commercial circles, they have worked hard all day, and everyone wants to go to bed early, but the sound of mahjong next door, the noise, the sound of wireless broadcasts, the sound of jeep horns, etc., are more powerful than the call of educators and health experts to advocate going to bed early, and ultimately make you unable to sleep, resulting in everyone developing the habit of going to bed late. As for the general poor class and the unemployed masses, they are planning for tomorrow's firewood, rice, oil, and salt, and are worried and anxious, so they can't sleep even more. Now, there are fewer and fewer people who can enjoy the happiness of going to bed early in this year.

We sympathize with Mayor Wu's suggestion, and we understand the significance of going to bed early and getting up early for physical health, but how to get a comfortable early sleep has simply become an unsolvable social problem in the city. I think there is absolutely no fool in the world who "has the good fortune but doesn't enjoy it, and sits and waits for dawn."

The Story of a Psychoanalyst

### The Innocent Murderer 6

— Xu Guiting

"She told us to look for you," said the police chief.

"Is Lussan himself there?"

"We haven't found him yet. He escaped."

"Can you help us?" the police chief asked. "I think he must have gone mad."

"Yes, he suffers from schizo-epilepsy. No one can ever predict what such a nerve patient will do. He may not remember what he did himself, and he won't be able to tell that he has done wrong."

The police chief then took Mien and introduced him to Dr. Hailing. Hailing said, "I have managed to anesthetize her nerves, so she won't feel much pain now. If you want to talk to her, now is the time."

Mien thought that Mrs. Lussan, sleeping in bed, must be beautiful, petite, and brave. Unexpectedly, just the opposite, she became very ugly, shrunk up like a dwarf. A pair of dark eyes darted back and forth until Mien came in before stopping.

Mien said, "Hey, Mrs. Lussan! What have they done to you?"

Mrs. Lussan was silent for a long time before whispering, "Dr. Mien, what will happen to Adam in the future? I think I'm going to die eventually. So, what's the best thing to do? He will always be unable to escape the law."

"He will definitely be fine, I will take care of him."

Her face gradually relaxed, and her voice was clearer than before, saying, "That's great. You must explain it to them, otherwise they won't understand. You must declare to them that you can cure him. I am indeed a fool for not taking good care of him. I didn't know that he would actually hide a pistol."

"Dr. Mien, we don't know how we can get some money. We have never had any money. It shouldn't be a problem for you, right?"

"No problem, I will take care of Adam. You go to sleep."

Mien walked out of the room with Dr. Hailing. When he reached the door, he whispered to Hailing, "You take care of her, I can't find a single clue."

Hailing patted Mien's arm and said, "Goodbye."

When Mien returned home, he saw that the consulting room was still lit. Lussan and his wife, Polly, were sitting opposite each other by the fireplace. They stood up at the same time. Polly smiled and said to her husband, "Hey, my love! We've been waiting for you for a long time!"

Mien immediately interjected, "Hey, Lussan!"

Lussan smiled slightly, but did not say anything. He was wearing a black evening dress, and he looked very tall and handsome. Polly said, "Mr. Lussan came here to return a cane to you."

"Oh, you finally returned it to me, you little thief," Mien said.

"That's right, the cane is already in the living room." Lussan said indifferently, "I'm really sorry to trouble Mrs. Mien, but she is the most amiable and understanding person. I think Mrs. Mien must now understand my difficulties, right?"

Mrs. Mien smiled and said, "Of course, I understand your difficulties."

Lussan then continued very self-importantly, "I came here specially to tell this annoying story to Mrs. Mien, because maybe I will be gone before you come back. You certainly know that I have killed women. Although some other people may think of other things about me, I think you should know, because I often want to know..."

"Of course," Mien interrupted, "I want to know everything about you. Well, are you still carrying that pistol?"

"Yes," Lussan replied, while putting his hand into the right pocket of his coat.

"Then, please hand it over to me, okay?"

"That's not very important," Lussan replied.

Mien had no choice but to shrug his shoulders and say indifferently, "Okay, Polly, since you've already heard the story, you'd better go to sleep. It's not early anymore." After finishing speaking, he turned to Lussan and said, "Polly, go away, let's talk, you probably don't mind, right?" (To be continued)

General Knowledge Quiz

### Pencil, Camphor Balls, Aluminum Pot - What Are They Really?

— Ding Yichang

Not long ago, didn't some people argue over the meaning of the two terms "civil war" and "internal strife"? "Rectifying names" is an important matter, but in our daily lives, there are many nouns that we often mistakenly use without realizing it. For example, "celluloid" is called "chemistry," a new type of man-made fiber is called "glass," and another type of transparent "plastic" product, such as combs, is also called "glass"... The names are so terribly wrong.

The following ten questions are all similar propositions. Even if we can't change our tongues for a while due to habit, at the very least, we should understand the background in our hearts.

I think: people with a middle school level of natural science knowledge should be able to answer more than seven questions correctly in ten minutes without any effort. The answers will be published in this column tomorrow.

1 We often use "pencils" to write, what do you think the black "lead core" in the middle of this pencil is made of?

A Western silver or nickel?

B An alloy of silver?

C Or, chromium?

5 Buy a pack of aluminum foil paper cigarettes and smoke them, there is always a silver-white metal foil "paper" wrapped around the cigarette rolls in the paper box, many people call it "aluminum foil paper," but what do you think it is:

A Aluminum foil?

B Tin foil?

C Or, is it really a thin sheet of aluminum?

6 Then, let me ask another question: what is the origin of the gold-colored "gold powder" that is printed on the pattern of the cigarette pack? Is it:

A Green steel powder?

B Purple steel powder?

C Or does it contain a low-gold metal powder with one ten-thousandth gold?

7 That's right, some cigarette pack patterns are printed not with gold "gold powder", but with silver "silver powder", then, what do you think this "silver powder" is originally:

A Aluminum powder?

B An alloy powder of silver and nickel?
