### Marshall Again Ascends Mount Lu to Meet Chairman and Discuss the Current Situation; Also Holds Talks with Song Meiling Before Departing Nanjing

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Guling, 26th] Special Envoy Marshall took off from Nanjing at 2 PM this afternoon, arriving in Xunyang at 3:30 PM. At 6:45 PM, he arrived at the Guling Guesthouse by sedan chair. Chief Secretary Huang Renlin specially represented the Chairman in descending the mountain to welcome him. Madame Marshall also went by sedan chair to Xiaotianchi, waiting for several minutes. When Marshall's sedan arrived, Madame Marshall waved her hand to welcome him no less than three times. Marshall also waved in return. Upon meeting, they shook hands warmly. Madame Marshall suggested getting out of the sedan and walking, talking as they walked. Madame Marshall immediately told Marshall that it had been raining continuously since he left. She also said, "I specially prepared two lamps for you in the study, so that you can read books and newspapers more easily." Madame Marshall also related to him that Madame Chiang Kai-shek treated her with sincerity, often inviting her to the guesthouse for meals and walks, and often accompanying her to Marshall's residence for meals, etc., one by one. Marshall also described the journey to Madame Marshall, appearing extremely pleased. They walked to the entrance of Guling Street, and then took the sedan back to the guesthouse to rest.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Guling, 26th] Marshall spoke with Chairman Chiang for 35 minutes at the Chairman's headquarters at 7:25 PM tonight, conveying the opinions of the Communist Party and agreeing to continue the meeting at 9 AM on the 27th.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 26th] The prelude to political negotiations has restarted today amidst the nationwide flames of war. The crucial theme is naturally how to extinguish the flames of war. However, judging from the content of Zhou Enlai's discussions with Marshall and Ambassador Stuart throughout the day until midnight, it still shows his full obstinacy and his desire to infiltrate unnecessary so-called new issues "such as the assassination case of Li and Wen" to obstruct the resolution of the problem. Marshall's return to Nanjing and Ambassador Stuart's delayed trip to Beiping are all for the sake of our country's peace. Ambassador Stuart once firmly believed that with his firm religious spirit, he could seek a proper resolution to this problem. Marshall is also willing to sacrifice his family life and, at the advanced age of over fifty, do his best to mediate between the two sides. However, Marshall still had to return empty-handed today, and Ambassador Stuart remained in the capital with confused emotions. This is what is causing anxiety among the national people who are expecting peace. According to reports, Zhou Enlai visited Marshall at 10:20 AM this morning, talking for two hours, and then visited Ambassador Stuart at 7:30 PM, and had dinner together, then held talks until 10:30 PM. It is understood that in addition to the war issues, some new branches have been infiltrated into the content of the two talks, namely the assassination case of Li and Wen, etc., using some past events as citations, so that the review of the main problems cannot be carried out.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Guling, 26th] It is heard that Marshall's second visit to Mount Lu will involve decisive discussions with Chairman Chiang on the current situation. Whether the overall situation can be clarified still depends on whether the Communist Party has sincerity in the peace negotiations.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Guling, 26th] Marshal Marshall, who had been away for four days, returned to Guling on the afternoon of the 26th, which has attracted close attention from people here. It is widely believed that Marshall brought the government's opinions to Nanjing last time. Now that he has met with Zhou Enlai of the Chinese Communist Party in Nanjing, he suddenly came to Guling, and he must have a response to the government's expectations.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 26th] Marshal Marshall met with Premier Song at 9:30 AM this morning, talking for nearly an hour. The content is unknown, but according to observers, it may be to convey the government's opinions.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 26th] Ambassador Stuart Leighton Stuart visited the Czech Republic and other embassies on the morning of the 26th and received Zhou Enlai at 5 PM in the afternoon. His trip to Beiping will be slightly delayed.

Liao is from Xiangyin, Hunan, and is now 46 years old. He successively held military positions.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Zhenjiang, 26th] Military news: The National Army has indeed recovered Suining and entered Suqian on the 25th. At this moment, the Communist army in Suining has collapsed and fled eastward in extreme embarrassment.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Taizhou, 26th] The left and right wings of the National Army are advancing towards Tianchang and Hai'an. Fierce fighting in Tianchang has been going on for many days, and the Communist army has repeatedly reinforced it. The battle situation is very fierce. There are four Communist regiments in Hai'an, and three Communist regiments in Qutang. The National Army is about 20 miles away from Hai'an.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Taizhou, 26th] The National Army is pressing on Qutang and will be able to take it down soon. Also, the National Army, launching a counterattack northward from Rugao, has approached Hai'an. The two routes will once again attack the city. Military officials here expect it to be taken down within three days.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Zhenjiang, 26th] The Communist army in Gaoyou has been frequently mobilizing in recent days. Some have been transferred north from Shaobo, and some have been transported south from Gaoyou. However, most of them are dragged along the waterways east and west along the canal at night. However, the Communist army transported southward to Yangtai County is actually more than transported northward, and there is still exaggerated propaganda of attacking Yangxian. At the moment, the Youshao line has been closed for traffic.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Zhenjiang, 26th] Because the Communist army in northern Jiangsu has been retreating steadily in recent weeks, some small groups have been sent to flee to southern Jiangsu, attempting to disrupt the Nanjing-Shanghai line. The 57th Brigade of the National Army stationed in Zhenjiang, in order to maintain local order, specially convened a security meeting on the 26th to encourage the people to implement the defense of their hometowns and prevent the activities of unscrupulous elements.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Zhenjiang, 26th] According to a phone call from Yangzhou, six regiments of the Communist army disturbed the Dayi settlement, Ganquan Mountain, and Yangjia Temple area on the 26th, and rushed to build large-scale fortifications around Yangjia Temple, with ambitions to invade Yangzhou, in order to save the declining trend of the Yangtai Highway and contain the National Army.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Xuzhou, 26th] The area north of Yizhen, Anhui, and south of Tianchang was fiercely attacked by the Communist army on the morning of the 25th. A part of the Communist army that was transported south by ship from Huaiyin has landed near Gaoyou and is rushing towards Shaobo. A part is still traveling west along Gaoyou Lake towards Tianchang. By noon, the National Army had driven the Communist army south of Tianchang back to Tianchang, and took the opportunity to advance to the Renhe settlement east of Tianchang, blocking the Communist army reinforcing Tianchang. After defeating the invading Communist army, the National Army in Jiashan took the opportunity to advance to the Wenzhen area, blocking the Communist army that continued to invade from Yuhai. A part of the Communist army was discovered near Banqiao, northeast of Mengcheng, and was driven back by the National Army after invading Mengcheng.

### Communist Party's Distorted Propaganda Does No Harm to the National Army

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Rugao, 26th] The National Army stationed in Nantong, after ten days of hard fighting, finally defeated the invading Communist army and entered Rugao City at 5 PM on the 23rd. However, after the Communist army suffered heavy losses and retreated, it used its consistent propaganda techniques to spread rumors that the National Army's 49th Division suffered a defeat and that Division Commander Wang Tiehan was captured, in an attempt to confuse the public. Now, the facts prove that the ones who defeated the Communist army and recovered Rugao City were the National Army's 49th Division, which the Communist Party widely publicized as having been annihilated. And Division Commander Wang Tiehan was not only not captured, but led his troops directly to Rugao, the Communist army's base area. From this, it can be proved that the Communist Party's distorted propaganda does no harm to the National Army, and is enough to expose that its propaganda is baseless, does not pay attention to reality, and deceives the people. This reporter arrived in Rugao this morning and met with Division Commander Wang Tiehan, and asked him for his impressions of the rumors spread by the Communist Party published in the Shanghai newspaper. Division Commander Wang laughed it off and said that all officers and soldiers of this division (referring to the 49th Division) are dedicated to the revolution, but only know how to protect the country and defend the people, are loyal and self-respecting, and will not hesitate to do what is right. The Communist Party's propaganda techniques are enough to prove its shamelessness.

### Communist Army in Hebei Builds Two Major Defense Lines; Deploys Heavy Troops Along the Zhang River; Communist Army Attacking Lutai on the Beining Railway Fails

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Beiping, 26th] Baoding Phone: (1) The Communist Army's Taihang Military Region has built two major defense lines along the Zhang River, one being the northern bank of the Wei River, a strip of land more than a hundred miles long, and the other being the area from Cixian to Matou Town. The former defense line is stationed with more than 50,000 troops, and the latter defense line with more than 30,000 troops. The purpose is to prevent the National Army from going north. Liu Bocheng serves as the commander-in-chief, and he has arrived in Cixian from Nanyang. (2) Hebei Chairman Sun Lianzhong returned to Beiping from Baoding this afternoon. Hebei provincial government personnel will receive military training in turn. Chairman Sun strictly prohibits Hebei provincial government officials from official or private socializing and does not make official pick-ups.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Beiping, 26th] The Communist army's glimpse into the Beining Railway is getting tighter. Lutai, between He and Tang, was attacked by approximately 700 Communist soldiers this morning, and fought fiercely with the garrison for two hours before retreating. Traffic is smooth.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Tianjin, 26th] Yongnian, southern Hebei, has been besieged for as long as August. Tens of thousands of residents in the city have starved to death due to lack of food. The Communist army has launched two fierce attacks without success, and is now digging tunnels to bury explosives to bomb the city, and has gathered more than 20,000 people to prepare for the third attack.

### Those Who Divide China and Oppose the Central Government Should Be Condemned by the World; The New York Times Defends US Policy Toward China

[Central News Agency Dispatch from New York, 24th] The New York Times published an article today refuting the rumors that reactionary factions in the United States and China are trying to provoke China into war, and defending the United States' recent policy toward China. The editorial is titled "Our Mission in China", and the article says: Chairman Chiang's National Government is the only recognized government of China, and as a wartime ally, it has obtained the guarantee of US assistance, and according to the Sino-Soviet Treaty, it has obtained the special guarantee of the Soviet government's separate moral and military assistance. Therefore, any protest should not be directed at the government and its supporters, but should condemn those who oppose the government and divide China. The Soviet Union's accusations against the United States in the economic field only need to compare the Soviet Union's control and interception policies towards other countries with the United States' open-door policy of free trade and equal opportunities to ensure peace, and its accusations can be seen as ridiculous. In the richest northeast of China, those who seek a state of monopoly and privilege are the Soviet Union, not the United States.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Washington, 25th, United Press] Thirty-eight members of the American Policy Association recently requested the State Department to stop the policy of urging the Chinese government to continue to make concessions to the Chinese Communist Party. They accused the Chinese Communist Party of breaking its promises to China and the world, and constantly striving to turn China into a vassal of the Soviet Union.

### Communist Party Plots to Sabotage the Railway Between Changzhou and Benniu on the Shanghai-Nanjing Line; Patrol Military Vehicles Are Dispatched to Prevent It

[Report from Our City] According to news from the transportation sector, at around 10 AM yesterday morning, near Changzhou Station on the Shanghai-Nanjing Line, a large number of Communist soldiers, about 300 in number, were found wearing variegated clothes and carrying rifles, pistols, and submachine guns and grenades, banding together to sabotage Changzhou Station. At the same time, about 100 Communist soldiers were also found at Benniu Station, 9 kilometers away from Changzhou Station. After being discovered by the local road protection team, it immediately notified road protection units everywhere to immediately increase their defenses. The Communist soldiers, seeing the situation, could not succeed and immediately dispersed and fled. It is confirmed that a grenade was found on the platform of Hepingmen Station, 5 kilometers away from the capital Nanjing, at midnight on the 25th. After being discovered by the station's road protection police, it was reported to the station's police section and immediately removed. Where this grenade came from and who placed it are currently unknown. The Shanghai line failed because the road protection team had strict defenses, so they used small attempts to destroy the station's equipment, thereby threatening the safety of passengers and disrupting public order.

Also, it is reported that Tang Enbo, Commander-in-Chief of the Shanghai-Nanjing Garrison, recently ordered Guo Fuzhou, Commander of the Road Protection, to strengthen defenses to prevent unexpected events. After receiving the order, Guo discussed it with the Railway Bureau. As a result, in addition to strengthening defenses at all stations along the railway on the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, yesterday a train with a total of ten cars was specially allocated, carrying officers and soldiers equipped with a large number of weapons, as a road protection patrol car, traveling back and forth day and night from yesterday on the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines. The Railway Bureau's police department's armored vehicle team also dispatched at any time to patrol each station.

### Communist Army's Vicious Plan Again Breaches the Honghu Dike

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 26th] According to news, the Communist army in northern Jiangsu recently planned a brutal and inhumane plan. If the war in northern Jiangsu is completely lost, it will destroy the dikes of Gaojiayan on the banks of Hongze Lake and Doubanji, Liulaojian, and other places along the canal to flood more than 20 counties east of northern Jiangsu and all counties in Huai. It is heard that the Communist army has now forcibly conscripted laborers in various places to prepare for excavation at any time. According to a common saying in northern Jiangsu: "If Gaojiayan collapses, Huaiyang will not see each other", which shows the magnitude of the water and the intensity of the harm.

### Li Minran Meets with Du Yuming; Agreement Can Be Expected if Talks Go Smoothly; Li Says He Will Make the "Peace Line" a Success

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Shenyang, 26th] Lin Biao's representative Li Minran's arrival in Shenyang has attracted much attention. On the morning of the 26th, Cai, the leader of the military mediation team, accompanied him to visit Chief Du, and they talked for three hours, leaving at 12:15 PM. It is heard that Du explained his opinions on the situation in the Northeast according to the government's intentions, and Li also put forward Lin's opinions. It is heard that the distance between what the two sides put forward is quite far, so it is difficult to reach what the general public expects for a while. According to Li's words to reporters: Du's frankness is admirable, and understanding each other's opinions should help in the negotiation of the issue. When asked if he would visit Du again, Li said it was possible. As for asking how Lin Biao's opinion is? Li said that it has not yet reached the time to publish it. Well-informed people believe that Li's visit here is to deal with the field for Lin, because Lin did not go to Changchun for the appointment, so this move is because the Northeast issue still needs to be considered in Nanjing as a whole.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Beiping, 26th] Powerful authorities here believe that Li Lisan's visit to Changchun and Shenyang is not worthy of attention, because the major plans of peace and war are decided in Nanjing and Lushan, not in Changchun and Shenyang. A certain important official also pointed out that Li Lisan's visit to Changchun and Shenyang is aimed at "wanting to run the Xinhua Daily in Changchun and Shenyang", but in general, the current situation in the Northeast is indeed easing, because the Communist army suffered huge losses to the main force after the Battle of Siping Street, and it urgently needs a considerable amount of time to replenish and reorganize before it can talk about war. On the National Army's side, after the victory, it must also consolidate the recovered areas and supplies. Therefore, although the flames of war are raging between the Yangtze and Han Rivers, the Northeast can still present a situation of rough peace in the short term.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Beiping, 26th] According to various sources, Lin Biao's representative Li Lisan's trip to Shenyang is not, as he said when he first arrived in Changchun, purely for a reply visit. If the talks with Du Yuming go smoothly, it is possible to seek an agreement on all or part of the following issues, namely (1) extending the local peace in the Northeast, (2) evacuating the Japanese prisoners of war in the Communist area before the end of September, (3) re-negotiating the demarcation of a buffer zone along the north bank of the Songhua River, and (4) the Communist army refraining from destroying the Xiaofengman power transmission to Shenyang. Li left Changchun for Shenyang, saying before his departure that he had more than 50% confidence when he came, and after meeting the President, it increased to 100%. Du Yuming sent Chen Liang, Deputy Commander of the Logistics Headquarters, to Beiping yesterday. At the airport, he also expressed that there is no major conflict in the Northeast at present, and he is willing to talk frankly with Li with great sincerity, hoping to reduce some misunderstandings and conflicts through this meeting, but he said that the opening of the overall situation still has to wait in Nanjing. He also pointed out that the Communist army's active movements in various parts of the Northeast are hindering peace. Among the above-mentioned issues, the exchange of prisoners and overseas Chinese is easy to solve. The government has already drafted a plan for this and sent personnel from the Prisoner and Overseas Chinese Administration to negotiate. As for the power transmission to Shenyang, the Communist Party has sent personnel to inspect the line, and the circuit can be repaired in the short term. Today's Li Minran seems to be completely different from the Li Lisan of the past. He also joked to others: "Although the Li Lisan line of the past was wrong, I will do my best to make the future Li Minran's peace line a success." Ambassador Stuart Leighton took a photo in front of the Mausoleum after visiting the Mausoleum on the 25th (Photo by Central News Agency)

### UNRRA Relief Supplies to China: Suspension Order to be Lifted Soon; Extent of Lifting Still Unknown

[United Press International, Washington, 25th] Authoritative sources reported today that the suspension of UNRRA's shipment of supplies to China will be lifted entirely or partially within a few days. A highly reliable source also informed a UPI reporter that the issuance of this order within a few days is a certainty. However, the question remains whether the lifting of the suspension will include all supplies or only a portion thereof. UNRRA personnel particularly emphasized that the suspension order issued by UNRRA Director Fiorello La Guardia, halting the shipment of all relief supplies to China except for essential food supplies, was due to port congestion in China and not a punitive measure taken due to improper distribution in China.

[Central News Agency, Geneva, 24th] UNRRA Deputy Secretary-General Dr. Bivin arrived here yesterday morning with his entourage to prepare for the conference to be held on August 5th.

### Zhejiang Local Financial Measures Outline Approved by Administrative Council; Proposal to Establish Yongning County Postponed to Next Meeting

[This Newspaper's Hangzhou, 26th Report] The Zhejiang Provincial Administrative Council, chaired by Chairman Shen in the morning of the 26th, continued to discuss financial and land grain proposals. Subsequently, the council, after revising the "Measures for Reorganizing the Financial Revenue and Expenditure System," passed the outline of local financial measures: County budgets should be based on income and expenditure; in addition to reorganizing existing taxes, counties should not establish new taxes, especially not permitted to use "through taxes" and "entry taxes" to eliminate harassment. This point was strongly advocated by Ruan Yicheng, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, and adopted by the council; Legitimate county tax revenues should be retained by the county at a rate of 70%, with 30% allocated to the province for unified allocation to remote and impoverished counties; The percentage of county budget should be re-determined, with administrative expenditure accounting for 28%, education and security police each accounting for 24%, construction accounting for 5%, social affairs accounting for 3%, and health accounting for 4%. The salaries of county-level employees and police should be increased, with the province setting standards by region, and each allowed to purchase one shi (about 100 liters) or three dou (about 30 liters) of rice at par value; National education funding, in addition to the amount listed in the county budget, is allowed to be raised by townships, supervised by the province and county; In the initial implementation of the new revenue and expenditure system, if revenue and expenditure are disconnected, the counties should convert part of this year's levied in-kind and pre-borrowed land tax into cash, and borrow funds from banks against the budget revenue, with interest allowed as legitimate expenses. The central proposal in the land grain category, the "Implementation Plan for Zhejiang Province's Current Land Tax and Grain Management Work," was also passed by the council. Its main points are: To reduce the burden on the people, the total amount of regular and additional taxes that originally exceeded one yuan per mu will be capped so the additional taxes do not exceed one times the regular tax; totals below five jiao will remain at the original levels. Every yuan levied will be converted to three dou of in-kind rice, one dou and five sheng of borrowed rice, one dou of public grain, and four sheng of grain husks, totaling five dou and nine sheng. The estimated total levy for the province is 12 million yuan, or 1 million shi of grain; Counties with early rice harvests will start collecting on August 16th, while others will start in September; To build warehouses and transportation plans, urge the payment of overdue taxes, facilitate the people, and regulate food supplies. At noon, Secretary-General Lei convened a discussion meeting, specifically raising the following issues for discussion: The implementation measures for counties to collect in-kind, eliminate malpractices, and benefit the people; To increase the salaries of county-level employees and police; Methods for raising funds for county clearance operations and the repatriation of stray soldiers, it was decided that the provincial government would allocate a total of 100 million yuan, distributed to the counties in ten grades in proportion to county security, population, land, and efficiency, if insufficient, they may apply for a discretionary increase. The cost of food and non-staple food required by stray soldiers will be drawn from the county's accumulated grain stocks, and the cost of travel back home will be allocated by the provincial government. At 8:30 PM, the Zhejiang-Fujian Office of the Good Samaritan Relief Association, and the commissioners and county magistrates of various departments, held a meeting at the provincial government to discuss relief issues throughout the province. Zhejiang Province considers the seven counties of Qingtian, Jinyun, Xianju, Linhai, Huangyan, and Yueqing, which are adjacent areas, difficult to govern, and plans to delineate the boundaries to establish Shuining County, which was submitted to the second discussion of the Provincial Administrative Council for decision, to be established after being submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval.

### Basic Chinese Language Invented by Major General Situ; Awarded a Medal by the U.S.

[United Press International, Hong Kong, 26th] A basic Chinese language system has been invented and will soon be applied to practical Chinese exercises. It is claimed that the system can provide students with practical knowledge of "writing" and "speaking" within three months, whereas the methods currently adopted require at least one year. The inventor is Major General Situ, a Chinese national who was directly ordered by General Stilwell, former commander of the Chinese Expeditionary Force in India, to invent a system to facilitate the training of Chinese officers by Americans during the war. Colonel Haigman, commander of the U.S. Army Guangzhou Detachment, on behalf of the U.S. Army, awarded him a medal for his great achievements. The system has 903 basic Chinese characters, which are essential for daily use, while the estimate of general Chinese teachers is 4,000 to 5,000 characters. Situ began to use this system at the Ramgarh Artillery Training School in India. It is claimed that a U.S. military officer, after studying this method for three months, was able to deliver four consecutive speeches in Chinese. He gave his original manuscript to an American to print a book in the United States, which will be published soon.

### The Future of Palestine

Palestine has been shrouded in an atmosphere of terror these past few days. On the 22nd of this month, the British military headquarters in the Holy City of Jerusalem, located at the King David Hotel, was bombed, resulting in nearly 150 deaths, injuries, and missing persons, according to British Prime Minister Attlee. The Jewish underground organization Irgun declared to local reporters on the 23rd that they were responsible for the bombing. According to the White Paper issued by the British government on the 24th, the violent acts of Jewish radicals have been continuous since last autumn, with the apparent goal of forcing the British government not to adopt policies contrary to the interests of the Jewish people. Therefore, we dare to say that the dispute between the Jewish and Arab peoples in Palestine, and how it will be resolved, is truly one of the most troublesome problems that Britain has faced since World War II.

After World War I, Palestine was originally a British mandated territory. However, since the report by the joint British-American investigation team after this war recommended that 100,000 Jews be moved to Palestine first, Britain has cleverly pulled in the United States, wanting the United States to support her and jointly solve this difficult problem. Looking into the hearts of the British, perhaps as the British press has stated, Palestine may be divided into Arab and Jewish factions, governed by a central administrative agency, in a similar way to India. This is naturally the most satisfactory wishful thinking for Britain. However, according to reports from Jerusalem, the Arab people firmly oppose the plan to partition Palestine, believing that it is practically impossible to establish two mutually hostile countries within this small land. Even the Jewish people have not given up the idea of relying on their own strength to return to their homeland completely and restore their country. Britain's attempt to please both sides may be met with disapproval from both.

After the war, Britain will feel headache and awkwardness in dealing with the problems of general territories, and the problem of Palestine may not be easier to solve than the problem of India. Although there are conflicts between the Indian and Muslim ethnic groups in India, the conflict between India and Islam superficially makes British rule difficult, but in reality, it may make British rule easier. Because if India and Islam cooperate and unanimously demand independence, then the British government has no reason to interfere in India's politics. Now, although Britain has nominally agreed to India's independence, it cannot actually withdraw its troops, because the British army must build national defense for India externally and maintain order internally. In terms of politics, if India and Islam cannot cooperate for one day, India will not be able to be separated from British rule for one day. Therefore, Britain's power in India is actually built on the contradictions within India.

In Palestine, the situation is very different from that in India. Palestine was originally the homeland of the Jewish people. In the Roman era, the Jews were expelled by the Romans; in the early 16th century, the Arabs occupied Palestine, and it has been so until today. After World War I, after the Executive Yuan approved the British mandate in 1922, the Jews gradually returned to their homeland. However, the Jews are best at business. In any country, as long as the Jews arrive, they will be able to grasp a large amount of local financial resources in a very short period of time. This has been the case in the United States, Germany, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France in the past. The Arabs certainly think they are not their opponents. The Arabs complain that the Jews bought a large amount of their land, leaving them without the means to make a living. This is also true. From 1922 to the end of this war, the conflict between the Arab and Jewish ethnic groups gradually increased. The two things that the Arabs hope for most are: First, to demand the withdrawal of Britain and the establishment of an independent Arab Palestine; second, to ban Jewish immigration. However, last year's report by the joint British-American investigation team advocated allowing 100,000 Jews to immigrate in 1946 and that Britain should continue to administer the mandate. This is exactly the opposite of the wishes of the Arabs. As a result, anti-Jewish movements arose one after another; and the Jewish people also took terrorist actions to deal with it. The situation became more and more intense, almost to the point of being out of control, and Britain suddenly stopped supporting the Jewish people. Foreign Secretary Bevin even publicly stated that he was not prepared to help 100,000 Jews immigrate to Palestine, but instead arrested a large number of Jewish terrorists and imprisoned them. As a result, the Jewish people also revolted against Britain; the British government really felt that it was not pleasing either side.

Britain's position is very painful. She once allowed the Jewish people to restore their country, and she also promised the Arab people unification. These two promises are obviously contradictory, conflicting, and there is no possibility of simultaneous fulfillment. According to Britain's traditional policy of the balance of power, the most ideal is naturally to "divide and rule," allowing the Arab and Jewish ethnic groups to be evenly matched, controlled and ruled by the British, just like Britain treats the Muslim and Indian ethnic groups in India. But now this method is difficult to implement. The Arabs are unified internally and their attitude is firm. Even Arab countries such as Egypt, Syria, Transjordan, Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, and Yemen have jointly requested the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the Palestine issue in September. Britain has already felt that it cannot be humiliated. Therefore, it wants to create Arabs temporarily and not allow Jews to immigrate; at the same time, the Jewish people are returning to their homeland, which is justified, and with the support of Jewish groups in various countries, Britain has no way to go back on its word and withdraw its orders.

In this stalemate, the British came up with two solutions. The first is to ask the United States to station troops in Palestine to protect Jewish immigration, because President Truman believes that the promise of allowing 100,000 Jews to immigrate to Palestine should be fulfilled. However, Britain's proposal is clearly putting the blame on the United States. Originally, the United States did not want to rule Palestine. Why should she send troops to cause disputes? Britain's second solution is the current partition of Palestine. According to this method, the Jews and Muslims are divided into two federal states. In the Arab federation, the Jews are not allowed to buy land, so that the Arabs can have a guaranteed livelihood. The Jewish people may agree with this method, but the Arab people have already announced that they do not want it. A nation's wealth is not entirely land. Even if the Jewish people do not buy land, most of the national wealth will still be concentrated in their hands in the future. The Arabs of course understand, so they refuse to recognize the partition. At the same time, what the Arabs demand is independence, and what the Jews demand is also independence. They are unwilling to accept British rule, because they no longer trust the British very much. This naturally makes Britain feel even more depressed. Britain's power in the Middle East will completely collapse in the future because the British army has withdrawn from Iran, Syria, and Lebanon, and may also withdraw from Egypt. In addition, the withdrawal from Palestine will make it impossible to control the Suez Canal.

However, in all fairness, both the Jewish and Muslim ethnic groups of the Republic of China are now going to extremes, and both sides are trying to achieve impossible goals. It is impossible for the Jewish people to ask the Arab people to let them freely immigrate and develop: it is also impossible for the Arab people to completely exclude the Jewish people. Both ethnic groups want to compete for this piece of land in Palestine, and both ethnic groups have no other way out. If you really want to solve this stalemate, perhaps partition and separate independence may be a barely satisfactory solution. Otherwise, even if the British army withdraws, it will not be able to survive if it struggles to the death with each other in the future. Rejecting tigers at the front gate and letting wolves in at the back gate may not have a better future. They should know that any nation, if it cannot unify internally, it will still be very far away to build a truly independent country. In fact, the Jewish and Arab people in Palestine should know this truth, and any nation in the world should be aware of this!

### Regarding the Sugar Price Issue, the Government Announces the Truth (Continued)

After the establishment of the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, in addition to reorganizing factory equipment and planning for restoration, it also received approximately 150,000 tons of sugar left by the Japanese. The corporation was ordered to sell the sugar in Shanghai in accordance with the regulations for the handling of enemy and puppet property. After all of the sugar is sold, it will be able to obtain approximately 200 billion yuan in national currency. After deducting a small amount of transportation costs, all of the money will be turned over to the national treasury. Since the corporation started selling on January 24, it has already deposited approximately 9 billion yuan into a special account at the Central Bank.

The operational guidelines of the corporation, established by the Resources Commission, are: (1) Except for direct allocation to large users and consumer cooperatives, sugar is sold wholesale to sugar merchants and not sold retail; (2) The price must be lower than the market price to stabilize prices.

When the corporation was first established, it originally planned to ship 10,000 tons of sugar from Taiwan to Shanghai every month starting in January. However, in reality, due to transportation difficulties, only 4,500 tons arrived in January, and only 1,500 tons arrived in June, which was far less than the planned quantity. The corporation sold three batches of sugar, totaling 3,300 tons, on May 24, May 30, and June 6, plus 300 tons of refined sugar, totaling 3,600 tons. The wholesale price was 66,000 yuan for all batches, and 66,500 yuan for the third batch. (The first two batches were delivered in Pudong, and the third batch was delivered in Puxi, so 500 yuan was added for transportation costs. In reality, the wholesale price was still 66,000 yuan.) Before May 24, the market price per dan was approximately 70,000 yuan. After the corporation sold sugar, the market price stabilized at approximately 70,000 yuan until June 6. After June, the sugar merchants realized that the corporation's inventory was not abundant, and the market price gradually increased to more than 80,000 yuan per dan. When the fourth batch of sugar was sold on June 14, the number of applications from sugar merchants reached 4,500 tons, which was more than three times the number of applications in the previous three batches. Since the corporation did not have enough inventory to supply, it planned to reduce the sale by 900 tons according to the allocation ratio of the sugar merchants in the first three batches, and temporarily did not sell to the sugar merchants established after the third batch of allocation. The Sugar Industry Association expressed its support for this method. The price was also slightly increased to 73,000 yuan because the market price was already 81,000 yuan. If the corporation still sold at the original price, the citizens would still have to buy sugar at the market price and would not be able to obtain real benefits. It would only cause the government to suffer unnecessary losses, and the sugar merchants would obtain excessive profits.

On the one hand, the corporation did not have enough sugar in stock, and on the other hand, the market price had already exceeded 100,000 yuan. It was deeply concerned that a price that was too low would not only allow sugar merchants to obtain exorbitant profits, but also that the remaining inventory would be completely bought up by the sugar merchants, and the market would be unable to be controlled. Therefore, it had no choice but to directly sell 700 tons on the market at a price of 98,000 yuan on June 20, June 21, and June 22. On the 23rd, it received a telegram from Taiwan stating that the loading of sugar in Taiwan had a definite date, and the demand from all parties was still strong. Therefore, it sold all of the spot goods and presold 3,000 tons of futures at a price of 95,000 yuan, while the market price of spot goods rose to 123,000 yuan. To sum up, the corporation's method of selling sugar is as follows: Except for direct supply to large users, such as sugar companies and consumer cooperatives, the rest are wholesale, and the sugar merchants purchase sugar at a more favorable price than the large users who purchase directly. The corporation also designates special personnel to handle tax certificate procedures to facilitate resale, and the profits of the sugar merchants are very generous; The corporation's reduction in sales in the fourth phase was purely due to insufficient inventory; The corporation's direct sale was a temporary emergency measure. Because there was little inventory left, if the selling price was not appropriately increased, there was a risk that all of the inventory would be sold out, and it would be more difficult to suppress the market increase; The sudden increase in sugar prices in the market this time was due to the understanding of the inventory situation, which caused special fluctuations.

Handling Measures

Based on the results of this investigation, it is believed that the Taiwan Sugar Corporation's original sugar sales method was generally appropriate, but when the market price rose, the corporation failed to take effective measures to consult with local authorities to find ways to suppress it, which was somewhat negligent. However, the corporation's sugar selling price, although lower than the market price, still followed the market price, which was also inappropriate. As for the transportation obstruction, it was the internal reason for the market price fluctuation this time. In order to solve the current and future difficulties, the proposed handling measures are as follows: Improve shipping conditions and strive to achieve the goal of shipping 10,000 tons of sugar from Taiwan to Shanghai every month; The Taiwan Sugar Corporation should aim to price control sugar price and gradually lower the current market price, and it has been decided that the price of the most recent allocation will be reduced to 80,000 yuan. However, in order to prevent market price increases, the Executive Yuan intends to order the Shanghai Municipal Government Social Affairs Bureau to strictly limit retail prices. In the future, the corporation should also supply a fixed amount once a week, and the amount allocated to each sugar merchant may be assigned to the Sugar Industry Association to review on its behalf. The corporation will publish the price and the amount allocated to each party in the newspaper on a regular basis to show credibility; In addition, it can also allocate sugar at any time depending on the market price increases and decreases in order to stabilize the market price; In order to achieve 300,000 tons of sugar production in 1948, the planting area of sugarcane must be expanded this summer. The Taiwan Governor-General's Office convened representatives from the Taiwan Corporation and sugarcane farmers on June 10 to discuss methods to encourage sugarcane planting and actively promote it in July, August, and September of this year; The Taiwan Sugar Corporation originally had a small number of Taiwan private shares. In the recent three to five years, it is not easy to make profits during the construction period, but after the machines are repaired, it will be a profitable business. At that time, it will be possible to absorb more private shares so that the people can share its benefits and recover part of the government's investment. (End)

### International Tribunal Continues to Summon Witnesses: Nanking Massacre Exposed; Japanese Troops' Brutality Unprecedented; Civilian Deaths Reach 200,000

[Tokyo, 26th Dispatch of the Agency] The Far East International Tribunal continued its hearing today. Dr. Xu Chuanjin testified, describing the atrocities of the Japanese army in Nanking. He stated that after the fall of Nanking in 1937, the Japanese invaders committed atrocities, killing over 200,000 civilians. Countless women were killed or injured, and houses were arbitrarily destroyed or burned. Chinese civilians were killed on sight, and all men of military age were taken away, either massacred by gunfire or burned to death.

[Tokyo, 26th Dispatch of Kaizosha] The Far East International Tribunal held a hearing today on the Nanking Massacre. Chief Prosecutor Keenan reappeared in court today. First, Prosecutor Sadtong continued his direct examination of witness Wilson from yesterday, regarding whether the sale of opium increased or decreased after the fall of Nanking. The witness replied that after the Japanese army occupied Nanking, the number of places openly selling opium increased sharply. He also used opium dens as an example to illustrate how the Japanese army destroyed the security of Nanking. Subsequently, Okamoto, the defense attorney for defendant Mutō, briefly questioned the witness about the situation in hospitals during the fall of Nanking. Then, Ito, the defense attorney for Matsui, the Japanese commander who condoned the massacre, stood up for cross-examination. Ito stated that yesterday the witness said that a certain Chinese woman developed secondary syphilis two months after being raped by Japanese soldiers. However, according to his research, the symptoms of secondary syphilis should only appear three months later, so the woman was not raped by Japanese soldiers. However, because Ito's question had no basis, Wilson was dismissed. Next, Xu Chuanyin, selected by our government to testify, took the stand. Xu, speaking fluent English, first stated his resume, saying that after graduating from Jinling University, he went to the United States to study at the University of Illinois. After returning to China, he worked in the railway industry and is now 62 years old. He then described the Japanese army's massacre at the time in a clear and powerful voice, saying that the Japanese were extremely barbaric, shooting people on sight. Anyone walking on the street, peeking from windows, or trying to escape was shot.

### Rape and Pillage Rampant; Corpses Litter the Streets

The behavior of Japanese soldiers towards women was unimaginable to the civilized world. I witnessed a woman being violated in a bathroom, naked and weeping. One day, I went to a friend's house and saw eleven people killed. Fourteen-year-old and eleven-year-old girls were violated on the platform, with bloodstains all over it. A family was about to cross the river by boat when Japanese soldiers suddenly came to inspect and saw two young women, who were then subjected to bestial acts in front of their parents and husbands. Furthermore, the Japanese army showed no respect for any private property. They broke into people's homes at will, took away items at will, and then set fire to the houses. Three days after the Japanese army entered the city, I obtained permission from the Japanese army to visit the streets, where I saw corpses lying everywhere, either chopped to pieces or lying on the road in the poses they were killed. I also witnessed Japanese soldiers killing people. I counted the corpses on a certain road, reaching 500, and I could no longer bear to count.

Searching and Gathering

The prosecutor then changed his questioning method to prove how the Japanese army carried out organized massacres. He questioned the witness about the situation of the Nanking Safety Zone International Relief Committee. Xu replied that the Relief Committee sheltered 200,000 to 300,000 homeless refugees. At that time, it was stipulated that anyone carrying weapons was absolutely not allowed to enter the shelter. However, at 8:00 AM on December 14th, high-ranking Japanese officers broke in, saying that Chinese soldiers were hiding in the safety zone, so they came to search. I and the foreign staff all replied that there were no Chinese soldiers in the safety zone. However, the Japanese soldiers came again the next day, wanting to arrest Chinese people in the safety zone. On one occasion, Japanese soldiers came to the safety zone and arrested 1,500 Chinese people. The next day, gunshots were heard near the International Relief Committee. People were sent to investigate, and it was learned that these Chinese people had been killed.

Forced Bowing

At noon on New Year's Day in 1938, I saw Japanese soldiers setting fire to the Soviet embassy, the YMCA, and the houses of other important people. Japanese soldiers, especially sentries, forced the people of the entire city to bow to them. I was also subjected to this kind of behavior, which continued until the ceasefire. I witnessed this attitude of the Japanese army in all the cities I visited (within 200 miles in Anhui Province). (Question) Were there any restrictions on Chinese people in commerce? (Answer) I once transported charcoal to Nanking by boat and obtained permission from a Chinese agent hired by the Japanese secret service because I shared commercial profits with them.

Open Drug Trafficking

(Question) After the fall of Nanking, was opium sold openly? (Answer) After Nanking fell, opium was sold openly, and opium dens were opened. White powder was easier to obtain, and white powder cigarettes were sold, especially to coolies. The Japanese side took this kind of measure to win over the coolies, and even opened sales outlets for this purpose. After the prosecutor finished questioning, defense attorney Kanzaki questioned, is it true that the witness said that the atrocities of the Japanese soldiers continued until the ceasefire? (Answer) The atrocities committed by the Japanese army in the three months after entering the city were very serious, and there were also atrocities later. Three Japanese soldiers went to a village to steal chickens and raped a beautiful woman. Her husband angrily killed two Japanese soldiers. The next day, Japanese soldiers came and forced the men in the village to take them away and shot them with machine guns. (Question) Does the witness know that the Japanese commander sent planes to drop leaflets before entering the city, saying that they would enter the city peacefully? (Answer) I don't know. (Question) Does the witness know that Chinese troops have a habit of committing atrocities and looting when entering and leaving cities? (Answer) Chinese troops have never committed such large-scale atrocities in peacetime without any resistance. (Question) Was there not a single Chinese soldier in the shelter? (Answer) No one carrying weapons. (Question) When Chinese troops retreated, did they not often wear civilian clothes and snipe from cover? (Answer) Such things may have happened, but these people should be regarded as ordinary citizens. Before they reorganize and resist, they are non-combatants. (Question) Were there not countless people like this in the witness's refugee shelter? (Answer) Those who put down their weapons are not regarded as plainclothes soldiers.

Group Massacre

Next, witness Shang Deyi testified. His testimony stated that he was living in the Nanking Refugee Zone at the time. At 11:00 AM on December 16th, he and four other people, including Shi, Cong, and neighbors, were taken to Xiaguan by soldiers who seemed to belong to the Nakajima unit. There were already thousands of men and women there. More than ten machine guns were placed in front. At about 4:00 PM, Japanese officers ordered the machine guns to be fired. The witness fell to the ground before the shooting and was immediately crushed by corpses, losing consciousness.

Next, He Shangde testified. His testimony stated that he had been a police officer. After the fall of Nanking, he and 300 other police officers lived in a brothel. All weapons were handed over to the International Committee and were not armed. The Court of Justice had become a refugee shelter at the time, with many ordinary people in addition to the police officers. On December 15th, the entire group was taken by Japanese soldiers to Xidamen. Several machine guns were placed outside the gate. We were divided into groups of 100, and Japanese soldiers forced us out of the gate with bayonets. As soon as we stepped out, we were shot by machine guns. Those who did not die from the machine gun fire were stabbed to death with bayonets. Of the groups of more than 100 people, 16 groups were killed. The witness fell to the ground in the instant before the machine guns fired and was not hit. Japanese soldiers then stabbed him in the back with a bayonet. The witness did not move. The Japanese soldiers then poured kerosene on the corpses and burned them. It was late at night, and the witness escaped from the scene and went to Dr. Wilson for treatment. About two thousand policemen died this time.

Various Atrocities

Next, Chen Fubao testified. His testimony stated that thirty-nine good people were taken away. Thirty-seven people with hat marks on their foreheads and gun-handling marks on their palms were killed. This happened in broad daylight near the American embassy. Japanese soldiers forced the corpses into the pond. That afternoon, the witness saw three Japanese soldiers raping a sixteen-year-old deaf girl. On December 16th, he was captured by Japanese soldiers again and witnessed Japanese soldiers forcing Chinese people to fight each other, stabbing to death those who lost. That afternoon, he witnessed the burning of hotels and furniture stores on Taiping Road. The Japanese soldiers were Corporal Mabara and Corporal Murakami from the Sangtian team of the Mukai unit. The witness also saw Japanese soldiers raping a pregnant woman on the third day after entering the city.

### Establishment of International Civil Aviation Organization; Treaty Approved by US Senate

[Associated Press, Washington, 26th Dispatch] The Senate today approved the treaty establishing the International Civil Aviation Organization, allowing the United States to join a world organization that guarantees the orderly and safe development of commercial aviation. The treaty was drafted at the 1944 Chicago Fifty-Six Nation Aviation Conference and will establish an international organization once approved by twenty-six countries. Its permanent headquarters will be located in Montreal, Canada. The organization intends to establish common aviation habits and standards worldwide, but has no economic powers. After the Senate approved the treaty, the State Department withdrew from the "Five Freedoms of Aviation" agreement previously established in Chicago. It is said that this agreement is outdated and unsuitable, and the United States is currently pursuing a plan to achieve freedom of the skies, and will continue to negotiate with various countries to establish bilateral agreements containing the same principles.

### Radius of Death Circle Half a Mile; Repeated Atomic Bomb Tests Prove Terrifying Power Equivalent to 50,000 Tons of TNT

[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 26th Broadcast: After a half-hour inspection, Atomic Bomb Test Commander General Blandy said today that if five atomic bombs were dropped on an enemy fleet in a real war, the casualties among the crew would be extremely severe. The results of this test revealed that the force of the blast throwing water into the air was much greater than expected. There are no reports yet on the condition of the animals on the test ships, but if any survived, the ships were stocked with food and drink to last them ten days.

[Associated Press, Bikini, 26th Dispatch] The atomic bomb has been definitively proven twice to be able to destroy all kinds of ships within a radius of half a mile. During the shallow-water test in Bikini yesterday, if there were crew members on the target ships, those on deck would have all been killed. This is the careful judgment of Vice Admiral Blandy, commander of the atomic bomb test. Yesterday's test scattered so much radiation that the seawater within 360,000 miles still contained radiation twenty-four hours after the explosion. The "instant death" radius recorded for the aerial explosion of the atomic bomb on this island on July 1st and the atomic bomb test in the sandy land of New Mexico last year was also half a mile. No ships survived within this radius in the two Bikini tests. According to aerial observers, judging from the earlier position of the pontoons, five of the six submarines that sank into the water appeared to have sunk, but Blandy said he could not be sure.

Commander-in-Chief Issues Report

If there were crew members below deck on the ships yesterday, most of them would have been injured due to "being shaken during the explosion." In addition, during the explosion, an unmanned plane 6,000 feet above the bomb was also damaged by the explosive force breaking through the water barrier. The bomb used in this test was roughly equivalent in power to the one used in Nagasaki. The reason why not many transport ships and other lighter ships sank was that they were farther from the center of the explosion. Blandy also emphasized that the tidal waves caused by the atomic bomb should not be ignored. This test caused twelve tidal waves, which, although no more than ten feet high, sank a landing craft on Bikini Beach.

[Associated Press, Bikini, 26th Dispatch] None of the shallow-water atomic bomb target fleets sank last night. The official number of those already at the bottom of the lagoon remains ten. The lagoon sky and the area surrounding the fleet are still covered in radiation and inaccessible. Scientists predict that this explosion will only kill a small number of fish.

[French News Agency, Capital of Colombia, 26th Dispatch] Radio traffic between here and New York was suddenly disrupted today by a mysterious atmosphere. It is generally believed that this blockage phenomenon is the result of the Bikini atomic bomb explosion.

White Birds Unharmed, Lake Fish Suffer

[Central News Agency, Bikini, 25th Consolidated Power] According to eyewitnesses, the explosive power of this atomic energy was extremely great. According to Laurence, the famous science reporter of "The New York Times" who witnessed four atomic bomb explosions, today's explosive power is equivalent to 50,000 tons of dynamite; this power is enough to flatten an area of ten square miles in a city, about two and a half times the explosive power of the Hiroshima explosion that was previously announced. The atomic energy explosion has two characteristics: In future naval warfare, there will no longer be any need for fleets to fire at enemy ships from the sea to destroy them. It can make seawater more terrifying than acid, releasing radioactive rain that is even more useless dead water, and making it impact the coastline and area behind it from the sky. Two hours after the underwater explosion today, millions of dead fish floated on the surface of the water, and only surviving white birds soared above the coral reefs. Three hours after the explosion, yellow patrol boats, remotely controlled by other ships and aircraft, entered the lagoon to collect samples of radioactive water and air. Lieutenant General Blandy said: The wave that hit three and a half miles away, far from the uninhabited coral beach of Bikini, was about seven to ten feet high. In addition, the green debris floating on the lagoon proved that the atomic bomb had detonated the coral lake bottom.

Starring Boat Destroyed Instantly

[Associated Press, USS McKinley Flagship, 25th Dispatch] The main ship of the atomic bomb test, Medium Landing Craft No. 60, appeared for the first time today. The ship split in one second and was completely destroyed immediately. This ship was one of the most important in the test fleet, as the atomic bomb was attached to the bottom of the ship. The boat also contained the most important electronic equipment, which had never been seen before.

[Associated Press Atomic Bomb Test Viewing Ship USS Appalaichin, 25th Dispatch] The extent of the damage to the target ships in the Bikini Lagoon from the first underwater atomic bomb explosion remains to be determined. What is currently known is that ten warships have sunk to the bottom of the sea. In addition, six other warships were damaged. Scientists and naval personnel entered the lagoon on observation ships within nine hours of the explosion. It will take another three to five days for the target ships to "cool down" until the investigation team can board. A cloud layer thirty miles away, contaminated with fission particles, slowly drifted northwest.

### Two Exiled Kings of Italy and Albania: Unhappy Memories in Egyptian Exile

[Reuters, Alexandria, 25th] In this ancient city built by Alexander the Great, reside two exiled European kings: former King Zog of Albania and former King Umberto II of Italy. They never meet here, and even if they did, they would not speak.

Former King Zog of Albania lives in a villa not far from the sea, living a secluded life, only occasionally strolling along the beach in the morning.

### British Shipbuilding Plan Considers Atomic Bomb Effects

[Agence France-Presse, London, 25th] Regarding the power of atomic bombs exploding in water, the naval correspondent for the "Daily Mail" recently cabled that the American atomic bomb tests at Bikini will have a significant impact on the British Navy. I believe the British Navy should consist of a large number of small, agile warships, destroyers, and some cruisers and aircraft carriers. Plans to build a large number of destroyers and agile warships are currently under consideration, with most of them already designed and to be built across the country.

The message mentioned further restrictions, stating: "Although prices have been restricted, if there is still a danger of inflation, a stricter tax policy must be considered. I also understand that it is not appropriate to implement a measure to increase tax rates while we are striving to increase production. But if this is the only way to avoid the disaster of inflation, then we have no other way to go."

### Broad Daylight Kidnapping in the City Center: Case Solved in Fourteen Hours, Kidnappers Found Feasting with Hostage; Sugar Merchant Xue Jianqiu Has a False Alarm; Principal Offender Zhang Yucan Confesses to Having Served as "Commander"

[Report from this Newspaper] Near Jiujiang Road and South Sichuan Road, in the bustling center of the Zhong District, a kidnapping case occurred yesterday morning. The victim was Xue Jianqiu, a sugar merchant from Fujian. Fortunately, the diligent efforts of the city police officers solved the case within fourteen hours, rescuing the hostage and arresting the four principal and accessory offenders. The details of the case are as follows:

Kidnapping

Xue Jianqiu, 33 years old, from Fujian, lives at 99 Hongkou Road, and is a sugar merchant. At around 9:30 a.m. yesterday morning (the 24th), Xue went to the Shanghai Municipal Housing Zoning Committee of the Administrative Yuan on Jiujiang Road and Middle Sichuan Road to visit a friend. As he was going down the stairs on the second floor, two kidnappers lying in wait saw him coming down and immediately pointed guns at him, ordering him not to make any noise. They then hijacked two rickshaws and fled. By about 2:00 p.m. that afternoon, the kidnappers made a phone call (number 42309) to Xue's residence. They told Xue's wife, Xue Xu Peilin (27 years old, from Pei County), that Mr. Xue was suspected of being a traitor and had been detained. If she wanted to resolve the matter, she would have to pay 20 million yuan.

Telephone Agreement

They also agreed to meet Xue Xu Peilin at the entrance of the Tiangong Theater on Xizang Road at around 5:00 p.m. They specified that she should wear a xiangling gauze cheongsam as a sign. Xue Xu Peilin was frightened and bewildered upon hearing this. She went as agreed, but did not see anyone until about 6:00 p.m. There was only a man wearing a Western-style shirt and checkered pants, carrying a raincoat, whispering with a large man wearing a xiangyun gauze shirt and pants. They lingered for a long time before leaving. Shortly after returning home, her husband Jianqiu called, saying, "Quickly raise 20 million, I am safe and sound." At about 8:00 p.m., Xue Xu Peilin and a friend reported the incident to the city police department. Director Zhang of the Criminal Investigation Department ordered Section Chief Feng Junhou of the Second Criminal Investigation Section to investigate overnight and sent female police officer Zhu Liying to disguise herself and wait at Xue's residence to eavesdrop on phone calls and look for clues.

That evening at around 11:00 p.m., the kidnappers called again, saying: "Have the funds been raised? They must be prepared by 12:00 p.m. tomorrow, otherwise Xue Jianqiu's life will be in danger." They also arranged to meet at the entrance of the Xin'cheng Police Station at 10:00 a.m. the next morning to hand over the money, which must be in gold bars and US dollars, not legal tender. Xue's wife was evasive and agreed, saying that she was in the process of borrowing money. By 9:30 a.m. yesterday morning, she suddenly received another phone call, changing the location to the second floor of the Kiesling Café on Nanjing Middle Road and ordering her to be met there.

Deployment

Upon receiving the news, the police department sent Section Chief Feng Qishan and other officers in advance to deploy officers and disguise themselves as waiters, rickshaw pullers, etc., while some pretended to be customers eating breakfast.

About half an hour later, Xue's wife hired a rickshaw and rushed to Kiesling's alone. When she arrived at the entrance, a man wearing white silk shirt and pants, standing on the side of the racecourse, followed her into the building. As soon as she reached the upper level of the stairs, she saw that the customers were seated to full capacity, and she quickly went downstairs, went to room 703 of the nearby Jinmen Hotel, and then went out. The disguised police officers realized that he was suspicious and followed him closely. He headed east to the entrance of the Zhongxing Leather Goods Store at No. 399, South of the Queen Shanghai Opera Theater on Xizang Road. Section Chief Feng and others bravely rushed forward and grabbed him, dragging him into the store and asking where the hostage was hidden. The man only gave his name as Ye Zhou and denied everything else. He was immediately taken back to the police station and detained, while the police continued to return to Kiesling's to observe the situation.

Soon after, another phone call came, specifying that Mrs. Xue should listen to the call and inviting her to the entrance of the Xin'cheng Police Station, where someone would meet her. Section Chief consoled her and told her to go with peace of mind. The surrounding area was also prepared. Xue's wife was confident and walked forward. At the same time, Section Chief and others followed from a distance. After walking a few steps, when they reached Maho Road, a rickshaw sped over and stopped next to Xue's wife. A passenger in the rickshaw invited her to get in. Xue's wife was alarmed but pretended to be calm and agreed to get in. The man handed her a piece of paper written by Xue Jianqiu, which read, "Bring the person who came with you to see me urgently." At this time, Section Chief and three others hired a rickshaw each and followed behind. At the Chengdu Road intersection, the rickshaw turned south, passing the Xin'cheng Police Station to Weihaiwei Road, crossing Chongqing Road to Maho Road.

Arresting the Criminals

The police officers looked around and ordered police chief Bai Wenqi to stop the rickshaw and capture the criminals. They dragged him into a nearby alley and ordered him to confess the whereabouts of the hostage. He claimed his name was Zhang Yucan, also known as Xifu, from Zhuji, and he lived in room 703 of the Jinmen Hotel. He had served as commander of the Zhejiang East Guerrilla Force and was actually a principal offender. He claimed that the hostage was hidden in a large building of a certain agency on Henan Road. The police immediately hired a car from the nearby Antai Car Company and escorted the man back to the police station. The original investigators then went to the above location and rescued the hostage Xue Jianqiu. They also arrested the criminal Zhang Zhenyuan (25 years old, from Ningbo). Zhang claimed that he used to be an adjutant in the army and lived at No. 240 of the New World Hotel. Later, the police rushed to the hotel and waited. Before long, an accessory offender named Gao Zhenyu arrived and was also arrested, and a symbol of the former company commander of the soldiers was found.

According to Xue, after being kidnapped, the criminals took him to the Meihua Restaurant on Nanjing West Road for breakfast, to the Tonglu Wumei Restaurant for lunch, to the Huaan Barber Shop for a haircut, and to the Jinyu Restaurant for dinner in the evening. They claimed to have a signature from a certain Officer Xu of the Xincheng Police Station and went to the Xianle's Dance Hall for a dance. When the dancing was over, they went to the Water Restaurant for a midnight snack. A total of 180,000 legal tender was spent that day, and Xue's diamond ring and gold watch were sold to pay for it. They enjoyed themselves for the whole day until midnight, when he was hidden in this large den of bandits. From being kidnapped to being rescued, it only took fourteen hours. The speed with which the police officers handled the case is evident.

### The Misfortune of Leprosy Patients! Lack of Equipment and Experts; Hospital Reconstruction Lacks Funding: Annual Report of the Leprosy Relief Association

[Report from this Newspaper] The terrible disease of leprosy continues to spread around the world, and the number of leprosy patients in our country is particularly high. According to estimates by the medical community, there are as many as one million leprosy patients in China, but there is not a single expert in the treatment of leprosy. In the United States, there are only five or six hundred leprosy patients, but there are dozens of leprosy treatment experts. Since its establishment, the China Leprosy Relief Association has done its utmost to treat leprosy patients in our country and eradicate leprosy, but during the War of Resistance, the Association's Shanghai Leprosy Hospital (in Dachang) was destroyed by artillery fire, and medical equipment was restricted, and it once fell into extremely difficult circumstances. At that time, the mortality rate of the Shanghai Provisional Leprosy Hospital was as high as 19%. After the victory, the general headquarters of the Leprosy Relief Association moved from Chongqing to Shanghai, and the Leprosy Hospital also received medical supplies from abroad, and the mortality rate was reduced to 2%. However, the reconstruction of the Association's official Leprosy Hospital is still extremely difficult. According to an estimate four months ago, the reconstruction cost would be 130 million yuan. The above report was obtained by the reporter at the Association's annual meeting yesterday. The Association held its 1946 annual meeting in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, presided over by Reverend Yao Xianyang, Doctor Diao Xinde, and others. In addition, many foreign members also attended. In addition to reporting on the difficulties of the general headquarters during the war, the conference also elected supervisors. It is also learned that the Association's Shanghai Provisional Leprosy Hospital currently has 51 patients, who are being treated with the injection of the "Dafengzi" Oil and, more recently, with the American-invented Promin injection, but the effectiveness of this drug is still in the testing phase.

### City Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors Meeting Passes Resolution to Prepare to Petition in Beijing; Urge Prompt Establishment of Economic Policies, Appointment of Various Committee Members and Conveners

### Yesterday's Shipping Industry Members' Meeting Agreed to Open the Two Mouths of the Yangtze River; the Relief and Transportation Group Decided to Divide into Six Groups to Expedite the Transportation of Relief Supplies and Righteous People

The Shanghai Shipping Industry Association convened its third plenary members' meeting yesterday to discuss the issue of opening the two mouths of the Yangtze River as consulted by President Song, and to strengthen the transportation of relief supplies and righteous people. More than 80 representatives from member companies such as Zhaoxing, Minsheng, Sanbei, Datong, Dada, Tianjin, Zhongxing, Suian, and China Shipping, including Lu Yinggeng, Yang Guanbei, Dong Haoyun, Chen Ganqing, Huang Jiaqiu, Shen Zhongyi, Ding Silan, and Li Yunliang, attended. Yang Guanbei chaired the meeting. First, the issue of opening the two mouths of the Yangtze River was discussed, and unanimous agreement was reached on the proposal passed by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and other groups a few days ago, as well as the temporary designation of Nanjing and Hankou as temporary unloading docks. The main points were that Nanjing and Hankou were temporarily specially permitted for foreign ships coming directly to China to unload relief supplies and government property, and no commercial goods were allowed to be mixed in. However, in order to facilitate the export of local products to reduce the trade deficit, there would be no restrictions on the export of local products. This opinion would be submitted to the government for adoption. The attending representatives expressed their excitement about the government's reconsideration of the four-port trade issue and adoption of public opinion. Subsequently, the discussion focused on strengthening the transportation of relief supplies and righteous people. The representatives expressed their willingness to use all their ships to transport relief supplies and righteous people as much as possible. More than 600 students from the Southwest Associated University and other righteous people awaiting transport in Shanghai will be transported to Tianjin within days. The relief and transportation group of the association will also be responsible for the allocation. It is appropriate that the relief and transportation group of the association is also responsible for the allocation. Currently, there are more domestic steamships and cargo ships, and it was decided to find ways to increase passenger capacity on existing cargo ships as much as possible. Regarding mail transportation, it was also decided that ships on each route should transport as much as possible, and the association would negotiate the price with the Postal Bureau, and the relief and transportation group would coordinate the handling. The proposal passed by the Relief and Transportation Committee that the industry should be divided into groups to undertake relief and transportation work was also unanimously approved. The group division is as follows: 1. China Merchants Group will assign the Si Hai ship as the first relief and transportation group. 2. Private companies will assign the Si Hai ship as the second relief and transportation group. 3. Other irregular coastal ships will form the third relief and transportation group. 4. Regular Yangtze River ships will form the fourth relief and transportation group. 5. Regular ships sailing from Shanghai to Ningbo, Wenzhou, and Minjiang will form the fifth collection. 6. Regular ships sailing on the northern lines will form the sixth group. The profits and losses will be publicly shared, and the relief and transportation group will coordinate the distribution to achieve success. Finally, a representative of the Ping An Shipping Company, Yu Yang, proposed a temporary motion that the sacrifices of the ships of various shipping companies in response to the war of resistance were extremely heavy. The administrative Yuan had previously approved compensation for sunken ships, and the government should quickly implement the compensation. Regarding subsidies to shipping companies, the method of subsidizing Minsheng Company should be used, and subsidies should be provided according to the degree of loss of each company, and loans should be provided for repairing and purchasing ships to facilitate the revival of the shipping industry.

### Inspector Cheng Discusses Some Departments of the Executive Yuan's Organizational Structure Not Meeting Regulations; Investigation of Empty Positions Also Necessary

[Report from this newspaper] According to the Da Mei Evening News: Inspector Cheng Zhongxing stated yesterday that the investigation of the "Executive Yuan" is currently being intensified, but no concrete results have been obtained so far. He has requested the Supervisory Yuan to send additional personnel to assist in the investigation. Cheng stated that in addition to thoroughly investigating all accounts of the "Executive Yuan," it is also necessary to investigate the organizational structure of the department, because some departments of the "Executive Yuan" do not meet the original government regulations and have no legal basis. Cheng stated that the results of the investigation will be forwarded by the Inspectorate to the Supervisory Yuan and then to the Supreme National Defense Conference, which will then decide how to handle the "Executive Yuan."

### "Atomic Bomb" Arrives in Shanghai

After the victory, the citizens of Shanghai have become accustomed to using the newly invented insecticide DDT, but every day at dawn, drowned rats can still be seen along the way, indicating that although the nuisance of mosquitoes and flies has been eliminated, the rat infestation has not been completely resolved. Recently, provinces such as Henan and Shandong have also suffered from rampant plague, with many deaths. However, the American scientific community has indeed invented a highly effective rat poison powder called "Antu." This agent was originally used exclusively by the US military during the war, and after the victory, the pharmaceutical factory was allowed to sell it publicly. This medicine has no smell. However, it has a special toxic chemical effect on rodents. When rodents eat it, they develop a fever all over their bodies, dry throat, and gas within 15 to 30 minutes, and must come out of the hole to drink water and breathe air. As a result, they become increasingly dangerous in the wind and die in water. Before long, they are lying in piles on the open courtyard floor. Since the world has had rat poisons, its effectiveness has been unmatched. Europeans and Americans who have tried this powder call it the "rat atomic bomb," which shows its enormous effectiveness. The powder has recently been shipped to Shanghai by the American Lan Rui Shi Brothers Chemical Factory. The packaging is divided into two types, A and B. Type A can be used four times, and type B can only be used once. Regardless of the old houses where rats gather, if the residents purchase a portion of type A "Antu" rat poison powder, it will be enough to reduce the rat infestation. After the war, rat plagues in various parts of our country this year have made people turn pale at the mention of them, and as a result, they are rushing to purchase "Antu" from the company, competing to be the first. The first batch of goods sold out within ten days, and it is reported that the second batch will arrive in Shanghai at the end of this month. The factory has appointed the Eurasian Trading Company, 3rd Floor, Guangxue Building, 128 Bowuyuan Road, as the manager for China and Hong Kong, with instructions available. Those who request it should attach 20 yuan for postage and it will be sent.

Preventive Measures Require Rat Elimination First

### Two Traitors Given Lighter Sentences; Liu Yangshan Sentenced to Fifteen Years, Qian Xiaomin Sentenced to One Year and Six Months; Judges Explained After Sentencing

[Report from this newspaper] The High Court announced many traitor cases yesterday morning: (1) Liu Yangshan, Deputy Minister of the Pseudo-Central Organization Department and Chairman of the Pseudo-Municipal Party Department, was sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment and ten years of deprivation of civil rights. Liu was a member of the Nationalist Party. Yesterday, he was wearing a blue cloth gown, white pants, and a shaved head. After reading the main text of the judgment, the presiding judge explained to the defendant that if the crime were handled according to the regulations for punishing party members, the sentence would be even heavier. The sentence was now based on the regulations for punishing traitors, which had been greatly reduced. (2) Qian Xiaomin, acting director of the Intelligence Section of the Pseudo-Special Operations Headquarters in Wuxi, was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment and two years of deprivation of civil rights. The presiding judge explained the judgment, saying that the defendant joined the pseudo-government under coercion and had provided some minor services to our underground workers during his tenure in the Special Operations Headquarters, so the sentence was reduced. (3) Shen Junping, a staff member of the Yixing Station of the Pseudo-Special Operations Headquarters, was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment and two years of deprivation of civil rights. (4) Kang Si Danning, Secretary of the Shanghai Office of the Italian Fascist Party, was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment and two years of deprivation of civil rights.

Her testimony was mostly the same as before, stating that her position as an accountant in the Pseudo-Special Operations Headquarters was because her husband was the deputy director, and for the convenience of going in and out, she also took the name of an accountant, but she actually had no work. She resigned after less than a year. Her position as a member of the Pseudo-Economic Committee was also because Chen Qun's wife was insulted by the enemy gendarmerie on the road, and in order to ensure travel safety, she took a pseudo-official position and obtained a license, but she never attended meetings and did not receive any salary. She never participated in the arrest of people by "76." The case was concluded with arguments yesterday and is scheduled to be announced at 9:30 a.m. on the 31st of this month.

Also, Qian Jieyi, a councilor of the Pseudo-Jiangsu Provincial Government and chairman of the Suzhou Branch of the Pseudo-China Cooperative, has also been tried.

### Regulations for Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation

The Freedom Protection Association Requests Enactment

According to the person in charge of the People's Freedom Protection Association, the state formulates laws to reward good and punish evil, and maintain discipline. Those who commit crimes deserve punishment, but there are also those who are wrongly accused due to various reasons. In the legal system, although there are opportunities for redress such as appeals and retrials, the victims have already suffered mental and material losses. Therefore, the establishment of a system for compensation for wrongful imprisonment is really necessary. In view of this, the association submitted reasons to the highest authorities, requesting the enactment of regulations for compensation for wrongful imprisonment.

(3) Whether or not newspapers and magazines should be banned, there are four categories: 1. Those that have been approved and issued registration certificates by the Central Government will of course not be banned. 2. Those that have been transferred to the Central Government by the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs but have not yet been issued registration certificates will not be banned temporarily. 3. Those who have not applied to the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs at all. 4. Those that have been approved, but publish obscene and lewd words that are sufficient to affect morals and security.

### Huang Xianggu and Others' Proposal for Retrial

[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday afternoon, the High Court retried Rao Shu, who is from Wuhu and is 54 years old. He has been a professor at Mailun College and Jinan University for many years. After the "September 18th" Incident, he joined the Military Statistics Bureau. He was arrested by the Pseudo-Special Operations Headquarters in September 1939 and defected to the pseudo-government, serving as the chief of the Second Section of the Second Division of the Pseudo-Special Operations Headquarters, responsible for international intelligence. Later, he was transferred to be the deputy district chief of the Wuhan District, contacting Goshima Shigeru, the section chief of the Hankou enemy gendarmerie, and specializing in arresting our underground workers. When Goshima Shigeru was transferred to Shanghai as the chief of the police affairs section of the Pseudo-Police Bureau in September 1942, Rao also came to Shanghai to work in the Pseudo-Police Bureau as deputy chief. Yesterday, the defendant argued in court that he originally planned to assassinate Li Shiqun, but he was arrested due to the lack of secrecy. In order to cope with the environment, he took a pseudo-official position, but he had rescued underground workers such as Lin Yin and Chen Shihua during his tenure. The court ordered an adjournment for further questioning.

On the same day, the cases of Zhou Wenrui, director of the Finance Bureau of the Pseudo-Dadao Municipal Government and director of the Pseudo-Municipal Sports Association, Yang Yongrui, a liaison officer of the Pseudo-Jiangyin Oil Industry Association, and Hu Zhanggen, etc., were also heard and adjourned for further questioning.

### The Bandit Who Shot the Pilot Executed on the Gallows; An Accomplice Sentenced to Long Imprisonment

[Report from this newspaper] The bandit Xuan Changgen was sentenced to death by the local court for repeated offenses. After review by the Supreme Court, the sentence was confirmed. He was executed at the gallows in the Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison at 7 a.m. yesterday. The prosecutor of the local court, Chuan Bang, visited the site to supervise the execution.

The criminal was originally scheduled to be executed by shooting, but because there was no suitable execution site in the prison, hanging was used instead. The four Japanese war criminals who were sentenced to death by hanging by the US military court a few months ago were executed on the same gallows.

The bandit was 27 years old, from Shanghai, and lived at No. 10 Shipin Lane, Nanshi. After the victory, he committed robberies in this city with accomplices, committing as many as eleven cases. He also shot and killed a victim, pilot Wang Ji. His last crime was robbing Sun Shixian's family at No. 56 Duofuli, 504 Zhengdong Road. After the victim reported to the police bureau, the accomplice Zhang Yunsheng and others were arrested in the Vanhuangdu Heping Hotel. Based on the clues, Xuan was finally captured at No. 10 Xinyong Street, and was sentenced to death by the local court after questioning. The accomplice Hu Cailin was sentenced to life imprisonment, and Zhang Yunsheng was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment.

At 6 a.m. yesterday, Prosecutor Chuan Bang, accompanied by Police Chief Chen, Pan Yuyi, Squad Leader Lang Qinyi, Xu Xuanlin, Zhang, and several bailiffs, rushed to the Shanghai Prison, brought out Xuan Changgen, and escorted him to the gallows. The bailiffs covered his head with a black cloth and hung his neck on the gallows. His feet were exposed on a specially made movable iron plate. After the supervising officer gave an order, he moved the electric button, the iron plate fell downward, the criminal was suspended in the air, and he died within a few minutes. After verification, the body was sent to the Hede Road autopsy site to be claimed by his family.

### Electing a "Miss Shanghai" is Another New Plan to Help Refugees in Northern Jiangsu; Bathhouses Throughout the City Are Also Willing to Do Their Best

The Shanghai Fundraising Committee of the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association plans to elect a "Miss Shanghai" to help with the disaster relief. This proposal has been approved by Du Yuesheng, the chairman of the association, and Wu Kaixian, the vice chairman. However, due to the large scope, it is not easy to hold it centrally, so the various plans are still being drafted. It is understood that it is planned to divide Miss Shanghai into four groups: (1) Ladies from noble families, (2) Movie stars, (3) Singers, (4) Dance stars. Each group will be elected separately. The election tickets will be priced at 5,000 yuan each, and all income will be used for disaster relief in Northern Jiangsu. The address is set at "New Senlin Night Flower Garden", and the date is tentatively set for mid-next month. The association will invite all relevant parties for detailed discussions in the near future. In addition, eighty-one bathhouses throughout the city are also scheduled to hold a charity sale on August 1, and all proceeds will be used to help with disaster relief.

Landlords actually receive less than four dou of rent rice per mu, while the land tax requires more than seven dou of grain per mu, which is particularly unreasonable.

### Rickshaw Industry Appeals

[Report from this newspaper] Rickshaws are an outdated and unreasonable means of transportation. The existence of rickshaws is enough to hinder modern urban traffic. Therefore, the Ministry of Social Affairs ordered the competent authorities in various places to eliminate rickshaws within three years. This city will gradually eliminate them by reducing one-third each year, implemented by the Public Works Bureau. In addition to prohibiting new car registration, it has been decided to reduce one-tenth of them first in the autumn of this year. It is also heard that Chairman Jiang recently ordered the Ministry of Social Affairs to shorten the elimination period to two years. However, the rickshaw industry association, in view of the serious unemployment problem of the large number of rickshaw pullers, has separately submitted letters to the Municipal Public Works Bureau, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Social Affairs requesting the withdrawal of the order, but has not received any reply so far. The rickshaw industry association is now preparing to organize a rickshaw pullers' vocational association and a rickshaw mutual aid association and other organizations to appeal to the authorities again.

[Report from this newspaper] The new mail ship General Gordon, managed by the American President Lines, arrived in port for the first time from the United States this Tuesday, carrying more than 600 passengers. The ship was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai this morning for Hong Kong, via Singapore, Little Luzon, and Bombay, and return from Bombay to Hong Kong, directly to New York. It is now learned that due to the inconvenience of loading and unloading goods, it will not be able to depart on time and has been decided to postpone the departure until 2 p.m. next Monday.

### Soviet Ship Smornany Suffers Damage to the Stern and Breaks Down

[Report from this newspaper] The China Merchants Bureau's Zhongkai ship, on its return trip from Tianjin to Shanghai on the 23rd of this month at around 5 p.m., was docking at the Jinliyuan Wharf. While passing through the Pudong area of the Xinkai River, it accidentally collided with the nearby Soviet ship Smornany. The Zhongkai ship accidentally collided with the stern of the Soviet ship Smornany, damaging two iron plates. Fortunately, they were above the waterline and there was no major problem. The agent of the ship, Mao Tai Yanghang, immediately negotiated with the China Merchants Bureau, which ordered the Pudong Shipyard to send craftsmen to repair it. According to the shipyard's estimate, it will take at least three days and nights to repair it. However, the Soviet ship is scheduled to depart this morning to return to Vladivostok and cannot wait. Therefore, the China Merchants Bureau informed Mao Tai Yanghang by letter to inform the Soviet ship that it would be allowed to repair it when it comes to Shanghai next time. It is also learned that Mr. H. Tarby, the warehouse supervisor of the British Swire Shipping Company, a Danish national who has served Swire for more than 50 years, has applied for six months of leave this time and is scheduled to take the Soviet ship with his wife to Vladivostok this morning, via Moscow, to return to England.

### Ministry of Education Convened Higher Education Conference: Maintain Chief Instructor System, Strengthen Guidance Work, Determine Nature and Organization of Student Self-Government Associations, Relax Restrictions on Self-Funded Students Studying Abroad, Abolish University Graduate Schools, and Establish Research Institutes Instead

[Report from our Nanjing newspaper] The Ministry of Education believes that the organization and staffing of higher education, specialized schools, and various departments, as well as the revision of curricula, all require extensive discussion to achieve appropriate improvements. Therefore, on the 24th, it convened relevant educators and experts in the Ministry's conference room to discuss these issues from 9 AM to 1 PM and from 4 PM to 7 PM.

Vice Minister Zhu Jingnong presided over the meeting.

Initial Proposals

The proposals mainly concerned the improvement of the university education system. The experts, recognizing the importance of the matter, spoke enthusiastically. The main topics discussed included seven cases: (1) Should the Chief Instructor system and the tutor system be continued? (2) How should the University Affairs Council be organized? (3) Should the title of Chief of General Affairs of various universities be changed? (4) How should the teaching hours of presidents be strictly limited? (5) Should self-funded students be allowed to study abroad only after passing an examination? (6) Should students studying abroad be limited to graduates of schools above the specialized school level? (7) How should the number of teachers and salary standards be determined? All of the above cases were thoroughly reviewed and concrete conclusions were reached. However, it is still necessary to gather more opinions and conduct a final review before a final decision is made. No announcement will be made until then.

[Another report] The experts attending the Higher Education Discussion Conference convened by the Ministry of Education on the 24th are all personnel engaged in practical educational work. According to sources present, everyone offered opinions on higher education that day, suggesting that the Ministry review and consider them. Regarding the Chief Instructor system and the tutor system, the general opinion was to maintain the Chief Instructor system and establish a Guidance Committee to strengthen guidance work, abolish the current tutor system, strengthen the leadership of professors in each department over students in their respective departments, and increase their responsibility for guiding students in their academic and life matters. It was also decided to define the nature of student self-government associations, improve their organization, and strengthen their work. Regarding the organization of the University Affairs Council, the president, provost, chief instructor, chief of general affairs, and deans of each college would be ex officio members, and several representatives would be elected by the professors (the number of professor representatives should at least exceed the number of ex officio members, but should not exceed twice the number of ex officio members). The president would serve as chairman, and all important matters of the school would be discussed. In addition, an administrative meeting would be established, consisting of the president, provost, chief of general affairs, and deans of each college. This meeting would assist the president in handling matters related to the execution of school affairs. The title of Chief of General Affairs of various universities would remain the same, but it could not be held concurrently by a professor. The teaching hours of teachers would remain at nine to twelve hours per week as originally stipulated; those teaching less than nine to twelve hours would be considered part-time teachers. As for self-funded students studying abroad (restrictions will be relaxed next time, and detailed measures will be formulated separately).

Proposals for the Following Day

[Report from our Nanjing, 26th] The Higher Education Conference continued to be held at the Ministry of Education yesterday (25th) in the morning and afternoon. The Minister of Education presided over the meeting. There were four proposals for discussion: (1) Should the study period for students in engineering colleges be extended? (2) Should the University Organization Law and the Specialized School Organization Law be revised? (3) Should university law schools focus solely on cultivating legal talent, and should separate colleges be established for the economics and political science departments? (4) Should the name of university graduate schools exist, and how should the treatment of graduate students be regulated? The resolutions were: (1) The study period for students in engineering colleges may be extended by one year, with internships at the beginning of their studies. However, at the initial stage of recovery, various factories have not yet fully recovered, so this matter must wait until a suitable time to be implemented. (2) The University Organization Law and the Specialized School Organization Law were promulgated in 1929. After so long, there is now a need for revision. However, this is a major undertaking, involving a thick volume of regulations. After detailed discussion, a general outline was drafted, and further discussion will continue today. (3) The names of university graduate schools and research departments should be abolished, but research institutes may be established, with the heads of each college and department serving concurrently as directors, to facilitate close connections. Research institutes may recruit graduate students, who will enjoy research benefits and receive research subsidies. (4) Regarding the issue of university law schools, the resolution was: (a) Those with the original four departments of law, political science, economics, and sociology will remain as they are. (b) Those with only a pure law department will be called the Law School. (c) Law schools with both law and political science and economics departments may establish a separate College of Political Science and Economics, depending on actual needs, but this must be submitted for inspection and approval based on the actual situation. The meeting will continue in the Ministry of Education conference room today (26th). If there are no temporary proposals, the meeting will be adjourned.

### Party-State Elder Chu Fucheng Painstakingly Discusses the Current Silk Cocoon Crisis; Silk Factories Plan Two Relief Measures

[Our Newspaper] Chu Fucheng, a senior member of the Kuomintang (KMT), was recently elected as the chairman of the Third District Sericulture Industry Association. The association's members include all silk reeling factories in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and the cities of Nanjing and Shanghai. It is a large organization and the only group organization in the domestic sericulture industry. Our reporter interviewed Chu at his residence yesterday to inquire about the current situation of the silk industry. Chu told the reporter in an earnest tone: China's silk industry is currently facing a serious crisis. Farmers raising silkworms have often lost money from their production. The market price of improved silkworm eggs is now over 20,000 yuan per sheet. The highest price for mulberry leaves for feeding silkworms has also reached over 20,000 yuan per dan. It is estimated that each sheet of improved silkworm eggs can produce 60-70 jin of dry cocoons, and each sheet of silkworm eggs requires 7-8 dan of mulberry leaves.

Cost to Silkworm Farmers is 200,000 Yuan per Dan

Based on this ratio, the cost for silkworm farmers to produce one dan of dry cocoons is about 200,000 yuan. However, the purchase price of dry cocoons from improved silkworm eggs is at most 150,000 yuan per dan, so silkworm farmers feel they are losing money significantly. In terms of factory silk, the price of our country's medium-grade factory silk currently exported to the United States is about 2.12 million yuan per dan. However, the cost of reeling one dan of factory silk is currently 2 million yuan for the cocoons alone, and the reeling labor, interest, and losses account for about 1.5 million yuan. Therefore, the cost of each dan of factory silk has reached 3.5 million yuan.

Manufacturers Must Lose 1.45 Million Yuan per Dan

Compared with the current market price of factory silk, each dan must lose 1.45 million yuan. Moreover, for this spring cocoon loan, the manufacturers themselves must fill 30% of the base capital in order to borrow 70% of the loan. If the factory silk is sold at the current market price, even if the 30% base capital is exhausted, it will not be enough to compensate for the losses, let alone talk about export competition. The silk factories deeply feel that the current crisis is severe.

Representatives Have Been Appointed to Petition the Government

Therefore, it has been decided to send representatives such as Leng Yuqiu to the government, together with the authorities of the China Silk Company, to formulate opinions and go to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in Nanjing to request relief. It is now heard that the silk factory industry has formulated two opinions on relief measures: (1) The factory silk that each silk factory has reeled will be purchased by the government in a unified manner, and then ways will be found to export it. (2) Each silk factory will find ways to negotiate exports on its own, and the government will supplement it with export subsidies. Chu further stated: It is hoped that the government can make definite regulations on relief measures before the end of this month so that each manufacturer can start preparing to buy autumn cocoons at the beginning of next month.

Failure to Provide Prompt Relief Will Affect Autumn Cocoons

Otherwise, if the relief method is not determined, the silk that the manufacturers have already reeled will still be unable to be resolved, let alone buy autumn cocoons. The impact will be that no silkworm farmers will be willing to cultivate the autumn silkworms that will be on the market in early September. Therefore, the speedy determination of relief measures is an urgent matter.

### Gold Price Drops Sharply, Affected by Hong Kong Gold Market

Dried Lily Buds Further Weaken

Since the new dried lily buds have come out, the range between the high and low prices has fallen by almost half. Although it rose slightly a few days ago, it soon softened again. This is because shipments have recently arrived from Zhenjiang, with dry and beautiful goods, and the asking price is cheap. The higher price is only 165,000 yuan, and the average is less than 160,000 yuan. Sales have remained sluggish recently, and it is not easy to improve in the short term.

### Covering Shorts, Major Players Push Up, Chinese Stocks Initiate Another Surge

After several days of weakness, the market rebounded yesterday, covering short positions. Once there was a change, a surge in momentum occurred.

Yesterday, the yarn market became increasingly unsustainable. Double yarn initially traded at 380,000, but it was the end of its strength. It soon fell to 1.32 million. Sales remained sluggish, especially for medium and small sizes. There was supply but no demand, and prices fell by 30,000 to 40,000. Double-strand yarn also fell by 50,000 to 60,000.

Yesterday, the New York American cotton wire continued to fall wildly by 100 points, with near-term old cotton at 33.38, far-term new cotton at 30.13, and Middling spot at 34.06.

However, the Shenxin No. 1,253 Factory still purchased fine-staple raw material Middling, while other factories and the Fangjian Company remained wary.

The cotton cloth market was bleak, with plentiful spot goods and weak actual demand. It was difficult to cover general floating positions. Serge fell by 1,500 yuan, and gray cloth was also restrained, falling by 500 yuan to 750 yuan, but bleached cloth and Shilin cloth were slightly flat.

After continuous weakness, flour was opportunistically absorbed by shops, and digestion became active, rising slightly by 100 yuan. Wheat bran was in short supply, and prices were tight. Shantou wheat was active but not prosperous. Ningbo stopped buying, and the situation was still high and strong, but lower-quality wheat was dull. Soybeans rose by 400 to 500 yuan due to slight inquiries from Shantou and oil mills also showing interest.

### UK Borrows Heavily from the United States

— Special Correspondent Ding Weidong Reporting from Nanjing on the 16th of This Month

After heated debate, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the "Anglo-American Financial and Trade Agreement" on July 13th by a vote of 219 to 155. The agreement stipulates a loan of 3,750,000,000 US dollars to the UK in exchange for the UK abandoning "Imperial and Sterling Area preferential tariffs." This agreement between the UK and the US was approved by the Senate as early as May 10th. After its passage by the House of Representatives, it was signed by President Truman on July 15th. In today's international situation, where clear divisions and tensions are pronounced, the establishment of this loan agreement has a significant impact on the world situation.

Loan Negotiations Experience Twists and Turns

Tracing the history of this loan, negotiations began in the winter of last year. At that time, the British and American administrative authorities had clear understanding and sufficient sincerity, but public opinion differed greatly. On the American side, it was believed that Britain had always been cunning and untrustworthy, and might obtain the loan but cancel tariffs. Promises of non-discrimination might not be fulfilled. In fact, this concern still exists today. The most obvious example is that during the passage of the agreement in the House of Representatives, some members argued that the UK should first be allowed to withdraw one billion US dollars, with the remaining loans allowed only when the UK showed that it could indeed fulfill its promises. At the same time, some unenlightened American financial capitalists also opposed the Anglo-American loan. They believed that after the British government obtained this huge sum, it would inevitably implement large-scale socialization plans domestically; if socialization plans were highly successful in Britain, the social foundation of American capitalism would be fundamentally affected and shaken. With the American attitude like this, general British public opinion was also deeply dissatisfied with the terms of the loan. Many people in Britain believed that this loan would be best if given as a gift, or at least as an interest-free loan. However, the United States now insists on interest, which has caused great dissatisfaction in British public opinion. The influential "London Economist" magazine stated, "Our current needs are the direct result of our earliest, longest, and most intense war effort... but we have to pay 140 million US dollars in interest every year!" The British newspapers compared the United States to the Jewish merchant in Shakespeare's plays. Conservative Party members believed that Britain's abandonment of the Imperial Preference system was equivalent to abandoning the last line of defense of the imperial economy, amounting to an excessive concession, and thus strongly opposed it. However, the fact that Britain needed this huge sum of money was undeniable, and the United States, for political and economic reasons, was also willing for the negotiations to succeed. After several rounds of compromises, the representatives of both sides finally concluded an agreement in Washington on December 6th last year. The total amount of the loan was 4.4 billion US dollars. At the same time, the UK's 2.5 billion US dollar debt under the Lend-Lease Act was cancelled. After deducting some cash, the actual loan amount was 3,750,000,000 US dollars. The loan term was 50 years, with an interest rate of 2%, payable from December 31, 1951. A week later, on December 14, the British Parliament accepted the terms of the loan and also passed the Bretton Woods International Monetary Fund plan. Sir Keynes, the British representative who bore the heavy responsibility of negotiation, later inserted a sentence in a British broadcast, praising American friendship: "I happened because of the joint war effort; but they are concerned about Britain's recovery!" It is not difficult to see from the implication that Britain was seeking compromise in the loan negotiations.

Making Concessions with Great Difficulty

Why did Britain make concessions to ensure the success of the negotiations? The most fundamental reason is that Britain won this war, but it bankrupted itself. Since industrialization in the 18th century, Britain has now for the first time fallen from the position of a creditor nation to that of a debtor nation. As of the end of last year, Britain's total debt reached 15,200,000,000 US dollars. Among them, 10,920,000,000 US dollars are debts owed to various countries within the Empire, with the largest creditors being India and Egypt, the former reaching 4,700,000,000 US dollars and the latter reaching 1,700,000,000 US dollars. Debts outside the Empire also reached 4,280,000,000 US dollars, with the United States, Argentina, and Portugal being major creditors. During the arduous years of war, Britain sacrificed 60% of its export trade, one-third of its overseas assets, and one-quarter of its ships as the price of survival. Churchill once said in Parliament: "During this war, Britain sacrificed everything," which is indeed not an empty phrase!

Due to these painful losses, Britain has won, but is very tired; and the difficulties of demobilization and reconstruction are numerous and yet to be overcome. First, the termination of the US Lend-Lease Act makes the food problem in the British Isles very serious. In the future, Britain must use a large amount of funds to purchase food and clothing overseas to feed its people. The recovery of Britain's export industry will still take considerable time. During the negotiations in Washington, the representatives of both the UK and the US estimated that there was no hope for a balance in the UK's revenue and expenditure for at least three years. Moreover, within the British Empire, India and Egypt are major creditors. Even if Britain exports goods to these two countries, the two countries do not necessarily have to export goods to Britain. Secondly, Britain urgently needs American loans as capital for recovery and reform. Among the reconstruction efforts, the most important is to modernize British industry. Britain industrialized earliest, but due to the prudence and conservatism of the national character, and the self-imposed limitations of capitalists, the degree of industrial modernization is now far inferior to that of the United States and Germany. During this war, the American industrial community organized a delegation to visit Britain to inspect British industry. They found that British workers' wages were at least one-third lower than those in the United States, which is a natural advantage of British industry; however, the production efficiency of British industry is far lower than that of the United States, with estimates that the average efficiency of the United States is more than two and a half times higher than that of Britain. Britain is clearly lagging behind in large-scale production. For example, the production cost of automobiles in Britain is twice as high as in the United States. Therefore, British industry must be modernized, otherwise it will be impossible to improve export trade. To modernize industry, it is necessary to obtain American friendship and assistance. Because the required capital is too large, Britain cannot bear it alone. Finally, the British Labor government wants to implement a socialization plan, gradually nationalizing the coal and iron industries while actively modernizing them, and at the same time implementing life insurance to stabilize people's lives; these reforms all require huge sums of money. Based on the above three reasons, it is no wonder that the British Chancellor of the Exchequer frankly stated in Parliament: "Britain's future financial plans depend on the success of the American loan. If it is not successful, Britain can only lower the people's living standards and strengthen trade controls to overcome this post-war difficulty." In fact, Britain's food problem is quite serious, and the Imperial Preference agreement is no longer reliable. Because Britain's position in the Sterling Area has been greatly weakened due to debt, and Britain cannot have a large amount of exports in the short term to exchange for the import of unnecessary goods. Therefore, borrowing from the United States is the only feasible strategy; another undesirable strategy is to submit to the Soviet Union.

Truman Signs the Major Loan to Britain (Special Dispatch from The New York Times)

American Views Shrouded in Worry

As for the United States' willingness to lend such a huge sum of money to Britain, whose interests are not entirely consistent, there are also major economic and political reasons. Economically, the productivity of American industry has increased dramatically due to the stimulation of the war, and the recovery work has been unusually smooth. Therefore, the American social economy has entered an unprecedented stage of prosperity, similar to the situation after the First World War. Due to the lessons of past history, the United States is always in the process of preventing the arrival of a recession, and the best preventive medicine is to open up more overseas markets. Before this war, the British Empire was the best customer of the United States. Now, American economists hold a common view that restoring the purchasing power of the British Empire is absolutely necessary for American overseas trade. Therefore, the purpose of this loan is undoubtedly to restore the market for American goods in the UK. In the loan agreement, Britain agreed to consider relaxing foreign exchange controls and planned to convene a meeting to abolish tariff barriers, which could also stimulate the development of American overseas trade. At the same time, one of the incidental purposes of the loan is to encourage Britain to repay its ten billion debt within the Empire and to unfreeze the funds that India and Egypt have in London. These countries are rapidly industrializing and are bound to become good customers for American goods. This is the economic reason why the United States is willing to lend. As for politics, the intentions of the Washington authorities are very far-reaching. To put it bluntly, they are afraid of closer ties between Britain and the Soviet Union, which would leave the United States isolated. This possibility seems to be a groundless worry in the current situation, but historians tell us that after 1918, Britain and France led Europe, at least economically, in opposition to the United States. In fact, before 1945, Britain used various methods to promote friendship between Britain and the Soviet Union. Powerful people in Britain openly stated that, given the extent of the destruction the Soviet Union suffered during the war, it would inevitably purchase large quantities of machinery and railway materials after the war. Within half a century, the Soviet Union would be a good customer for Britain. At the same time, the grain, timber, and fur produced by the Soviet Union are also needed by the British Isles. Although there have been many conflicts between Britain and the Soviet Union in the past year, London has never given up its efforts to promote understanding, really leaving room for an unknowable future everywhere. Therefore, if the loan to the United States cannot be successful, pragmatic Britain will approach pragmatic Soviet Union to solve practical difficulties. This is a situation that the United States absolutely does not want to create. House Speaker Rayburn said: "If we do not form an alliance with democratic Britain, I am afraid that someone will unite with Britain. At that time, heaven knows that we will have no allies on the other side of the Atlantic!" These words represent the views and worries of most Americans.

Impact After the Loan is Successful

The impact of the Anglo-American loan's success on the world situation is obvious. That is, Britain's foreign policy will be more in line with the United States in the future, and its attitude towards the Soviet Union will become more firm. The effort to win over Western and Northern European countries will become more active. "The division of the world" now seems to be forming into a settled situation. Domestically, Britain will make comprehensive economic efforts, and its enthusiasm will be no less active than the tension and enthusiasm of wartime production. As evidenced by the fact that just after the US House of Representatives passed the loan bill, Britain announced an order for machinery worth 100 million US dollars. At the same time, the socialization plan will be actively carried out to enhance Britain's economic strength. More leaders in the industry will enter politics to lead Britain through this severe economic crisis. In addition, the success of the loan has another good impact: Britain will have to gradually relax its control over its colonies in the future, at least economically, in order to gain the friendship and sympathy of the United States. At the same time, the inflow of American capital and commodities into various parts of the British Empire will also accelerate the arrival of the era of self-government in these regions.

For the United States, the passage of the loan bill is also a major success. This vibrant and emerging great power is promoting its world policy with military and economic tools. The military tools are the world's unparalleled navy and air force, the destructive atomic bomb, and strategically located world bases; these tools in the hands of the United States do have a stabilizing effect on the world. The economic tool is international loans, assisting the stability and recovery of various countries. The late President Roosevelt of the United States has always advocated abandoning economic isolationism, believing that only when the world is prosperous can the prosperity of the United States last; and only when the world is universally prosperous can lasting peace be guaranteed. This policy is being actively promoted by the Washington authorities. At the same time, it is not difficult to see that the United States is also using loans as a tool of diplomacy, thereby striving for the friendship of various countries. The most obvious recent example is that the Soviet Union wanted the French Communist Party to win the election and supplied France with a batch of grain, and the White House immediately agreed to lend France 1.3 billion US dollars to express American friendship and concern. Poor and backward countries like Abyssinia have also obtained a loan; Poland, which is under the control of the Soviet Union, is also on the list of loans. Only China, the leading country in Asia, still has a 500 million US dollar loan that is elusive and has not yet produced concrete results, which is the most distressing. In summary, under the current world economic policy of the United States, any unified and stable country has the best opportunity for reconstruction and construction; for our country, only by quickly stabilizing internally and completing unification can we avoid disappointing this golden opportunity. Otherwise, I am afraid that the international confrontation will become more and more obvious. One day, the United States will help Japan's recovery, and China's eight years of sacrifice in the Anti-Japanese War will have no price at all!

### July on Miami Beach

The only gambling venues allowed by law are racetracks. On the first day of the race, bets reached US$1,249,864. However, the madness of gambling is equally romantic in various clubs and hotels. The clubs are surrounded by wire mesh, and machine gunners guard the entrances. Thousands upon thousands of dollars roll around inside.

It is unknown when the craze for Miami Beach's revelry will subside, but a look at the total deposits in the banks cannot help but surprise everyone: US$376,756,194.49! This amount was brought by pot-bellied tycoons, who plan to spend it on this lavish enjoyment.

The statistics are indeed frightening. All 32,849 hotel rooms in the Greater Miami area are fully occupied, and all approximately 81,931 rooms in the 2,886 apartments have been rented to men and women tourists with full purses from all directions. The parking lots are packed. If you want to temporarily rent a place in someone's home, it costs US$35 per week, and you have to say a lot of thankful words.

Some of the more beautiful big companies, such as those along Lincoln Street on Miami Beach, often complain about this: their jewelry, leather goods, and fashions are often bought up by customers. But there is one thing to be comforted about: they have already done US$30 million worth of business in a month. (Jun Mo, July 15)

### Governor of Hong Kong to Visit Guangzhou to Discuss Direct Train Service Between Kowloon and Hankou with Guangdong Authorities

— Hong Kong Air Mail Dispatch on the 22nd of This Month, Special Correspondent Lin Youlan

Governor of Hong Kong, Yang Muqi

After the typhoon passed, Hong Kong, thanks to heaven's favor, suffered no major losses and quickly returned to normal. The Governor of Hong Kong, Yang Muqi, in order to strengthen Sino-British relations, is scheduled to go to the province on the 28th of this month to pay an official visit to our military and political authorities. Yang arrived in Hong Kong at the end of April and has been there for three months now, and this is said to be his first visit to the province.

Yang's visit to the province has been rumored before. It was said that it had been hindered at one point due to certain unpleasant Sino-British events (such as the National Daily incident). Now that Yang's visit to the province has a date, the relationship between Guangdong and Hong Kong may receive further understanding. According to informed sources close to the Hong Kong government, the most important matter for Yang to discuss with the Guangdong authorities will be the issue of direct train service between Kowloon and Hankou. Du Lihua, Director of the British Section of the Kowloon-Canton Railway, personally led several technicians to visit and inspect the Changsha-Hengyang sections on the eve of the official opening of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway on July 1, and had contact with Du Zhenyuan, Director of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway Bureau.

Direct train service between Kowloon and Hankou has a great impact on the Hong Kong business community. European and American goods transshipped from Kowloon will pour into the Central China area via the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, competing with foreign goods imported from Shanghai. However, it has already been recognized by those in the know that Kowloon's imported goods enter Central China directly without transshipment through Guangzhou, which benefits Hong Kong and harms Guangzhou. The connection and joint operation of the Guangdong-Hankou and Kowloon-Canton Railways were discussed long before the war. At that time, our side specially built a Huangpu branch line in the suburbs of Guangzhou, intending to make Huangpu the terminal station of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, replacing the position of Kowloon. This once attracted great attention from the Hong Kong government. After the war, there were rumors that the US would help us restore the opening of Huangpu Port, but it quickly subsided. Hong Kong recently requested direct train service between Kowloon and Hankou twice a month, but this has not yet become a reality. How this issue will be resolved in the end is now the focus of attention of the Hong Kong, Guangdong, Chinese and foreign business communities.

In the three months since Yang arrived in Hong Kong, he has made many achievements in restoring civil administration, including: (1) Promoting Hong Kong's autonomous political system; (2) Maintaining rice rationing, announcing a declaration of war on the black market, and resolving to eliminate those who disrupt price controls; (3) Settling strike waves; (4) Regularly restoring preferential tariffs for Hong Kong goods exported to British territories; (5) Implementing cloth control; (6) Establishing a Construction and Restoration Office to repair damaged houses throughout Hong Kong, opening the Peak residential area, and no longer prohibiting Chinese residents; (7) Rectifying the city appearance, arresting hawkers and prostitutes, etc.

Thoughts After Visiting the Bund Park

Dear Editor: The Bund Park is a great place for recreation and cooling off. Every summer, it is crowded with tourists. Before the war, the various facilities were still passable. During the enemy and puppet period, the environment changed, and tourists hesitated. Now that the sun is shining again, tourists are as numerous as before. However, the environment has not changed, and the Municipal Government is expected to make improvements: (1) A new gate must be opened. Before the war, there was a gate at the Wai Bai Du Bridge. Today, that gate is still blocked, and only a narrow side gate (in the southeast corner) serves as the main entrance and exit, which is crowded all day long, especially at dusk, and tourists from Hongkou have to walk many detours; (2) The barbed wire must be removed. The barbed wire on the walkways in the park is layered, and the light from the electric lamps is insufficient. If you are not careful, it is easy to tear your clothes and break your hands, especially for children. I once took my child to visit at night, and the child broke his hand and tore his clothes. As a result, we went to the park with interest but returned home disappointed; (3) The time must be extended. The summer days are very long, and it gets dark around 8:30 pm. The average citizen washes up after work, has dinner, and sets off, often arriving at the park at dark, but the park managers shout loudly at 9:50 pm that the time is up and it's time to close, which is a bit disappointing.

### Tiger Stove Should Sell Boiling Water

It is mid-summer, and the tiger epidemic is rampant. However, disease enters through the mouth. Most Shanghai citizens do not pay attention to hygiene. Modern ladies all take eating cold food as fashionable; the working class all fill their stomachs with unclean food; housewives quench their thirst with tea made from water boiled at tiger stoves. However, when tiger stoves are busy, they tend to serve customers with water that is not boiling, which easily causes illness. I hope that the tiger stove owners will uphold the morality of serving the public, pay attention to public hygiene, and not sell non-boiling water to customers. I also hope that the health authorities will pay attention to this!

### Midsummer Scenery on the Shores of Lake Michigan

— Special Dispatch from Our Chicago Correspondent Mao Shuqing, Dated 5th

In early summer, Chicago's heat rises to eighty-eight degrees. On the shores of Lake Michigan, hundreds and thousands of men and women, practically naked, lie on the beach. From Jackson Park in the south to the north side of Evanston, this twenty-six-mile stretch of Chicago's lakefront is their "human paradise." The azure waters of the lake reflect the sunlight, and the green willows along the shore sway in the breeze. There are well-maintained and beautiful parks, artificially arranged fountains, wide and flat roads, and summer night music performances. Summer is Chicago's golden season, attracting many wealthy American merchants. They pass through Chicago from New York, Washington, New Orleans, and Miami on their way to Canada for summer retreats. Summer is also Chicago's season of madness, attracting many local young men and women. Born and raised in Chicago, they endure cold winters, windy springs, and rainy autumns. Only the annual summer season brings them joy from the lake water and sweetness and pleasure from the cool breezes of the shore!

(I) Entertainment Center

The world's largest hotel is in Chicago, the world's most industrialized area is in Chicago, and the city with the most parks in the world is also Chicago. A secretary in the municipal government told me that there are a total of ninety-six famous parks in the city. In 1946, the municipal government budgeted $27 million for park management and administration, and this year's education budget is $80 million, with $10 million for fire protection. In the summer, from the Fourth of July Independence Day to Labor Day in September, the municipal government provides free music performances in major parks. Renowned orchestras and opera houses take turns performing every night, and these expenses are all paid by the municipal government. In addition, the municipal government plans to set up more than thirty entertainment centers, distributed near high schools throughout the city. During the school year, these centers are partially enjoyed by the middle schools, and on school holidays, they are open to the public. These "entertainment centers" include sports and parks, and it is said that the cost of these centers is considerable.

Chicago is the second largest city in the United States. In reality, Chicago's municipal scale is even larger than New York's. In terms of area, Chicago stretches twenty-six miles from north to south and perhaps one mile from east to west, making it larger than New York's "Manhattan" and slightly smaller than "Greater New York City." In terms of the complexity of its population, Chicago has more Polish, Italian, and Japanese people than New York. In Chicago, foreign immigrants of different nationalities often live together in groups. They still speak their own dialects and read their own small newspapers. It is said that this is what the American authorities find most "headache-inducing." The small tribal-style residential system hinders their integration and reduces their sense of belonging to America. To put it more bluntly, the small tribal-style residential system is not easily assimilated by the United States. During the war, Japanese residents in Chicago were all transferred to concentration camps in the west. After the war, the American authorities hoped to disperse the Japanese community across the forty-eight states, preventing them from concentrating in one place. However, little by little, they slowly returned to Chicago.

(II) A Complex City

On the streets of Chicago, I simply couldn't tell if someone approaching me was Japanese or one of my own compatriots. With yellow skin and black hair, especially the Japanese girls, who looked as delicate and pretty as Chinese ladies. One day, I was buying something in a grocery store, and another American customer asked me if I was Japanese. I told him I was Chinese. The store owner scolded the customer for being "ignorant" and "rash." The customer was not convinced, and they started arguing. In the end, I had to mediate to resolve the matter. The store owner said that Chicago has more Japanese people than any other place because Chicagoans are too "polite" to the Japanese. However, the store owner himself said: "I can't stand the Japanese because I fought against them in the Philippines!"

Black people account for one-tenth of the 3.5 million citizens. Black people also live in ethnic enclaves, mostly on the west side, along the lake, from 57th Street to 59th Street. The streets and grounds are full of black people, and therefore the area is relatively dirty. In the western suburbs, there are many small villages that are entirely owned by black people. They each have a small house, a small garden, and a Ford car. Their circumstances in America may have tragic elements, but their material lives are touched by the light of paradise.

Chicago is a complex city. From Lake Shore Drive to the neon-lit "State Street" and then west to Maxwell Street Market, you can travel through several centuries. Maxwell Street is like Shanghai's Chenghuang Miao, Suzhou's Xuanmiao Guan, and Nanjing's Fuzi Miao, but even dirtier and noisier than those places by ten thousand times. Originally, the moon, bedbugs, Eastern and Western cultures each have their advantages and disadvantages. We've seen them, so let it be.

The more complex the society, the more difficult the governance. Chicago has a mayor known as a "strong-arm politician" named Kelly. Chicagoans have a special term for their municipal government that outsiders cannot understand: the "Kelly-Nash machine." This machine is the ruler of Chicago and the source of all power in Chicago society. Nash was earlier than Kelly. It should really be called the "Nash-Kelly machine." But because the old name was used habitually, it has been retained. A joke circulating in Chicago says: When the last exposition was held, industrial and commercial products from all over were shipped to Chicago for exhibition. An old lady from the countryside also came to visit. After finishing her visit, the organizers asked her what she thought. She kept shaking her head. The organizers asked, "Old lady, what are you dissatisfied with?" She said: "I saw all kinds of machines, but why did you leave out the most famous Kelly-Nash machine?"

(III) Strong-Arm Mayor

You can imagine how powerful this strong-arm mayor's "strong arm" is! He is one of the big shots in the Democratic Party. Americans usually call him the boss of the Democratic Party. As long as Democrats hear "Kelly," even the most powerful among them seem to have to give him some "face." It is said that the current Secretary-General of the Democratic Party, the current Postmaster General Hannegan, was promoted by Kelly himself. In 1944, the Democratic National Convention was held in Chicago. Vice President Wallace was defeated, and Truman took office. This whole process was also the result of Kelly's control. I cannot verify whether this story is accurate, but Chicagoans deeply believe that their mayor has such great "magic."

I did not meet Mayor Kelly. A secretary from the municipal government guided me to visit the Municipal Museum and the Lakeside Observatory. The observatory is a fake model. Inside, it is dark. When the lights are turned on, you can see the movement of the celestial bodies, how the planets rotate, how the satellites orbit, and it is as realistic as the real thing. It is shown twice a day in the morning and afternoon, and three times on Sundays. Many children visit, accompanied by their parents to increase their knowledge. One of the administrators asked me: "I heard that there is a madman in China who invented the ninth planet?" The people watching laughed until they couldn't close their mouths.

The secretary from the municipal government told me many trivial stories about Chicago, and also told me many true stories about Madame Chiang's popular visit to the United States. He showed me the "Drake" Hotel on the Gold Coast, saying that it was where Madame Chiang stayed.

(IV) Gold Coast

The Gold Coast is the best paradise on the shores of Lake Michigan, and the most people swim there in the summer. There is a wooden fence between the road and the beach. Because this area is the most sophisticated in Chicago, it is filled with "offices" of large banks and companies, like the Bund of Shanghai's Nanjing Road, hence the name "Gold." Some say that the reflection of the lake water on the beach looks like gold, hence the name Gold Coast. I don't understand archaeology, so I don't have time to delve into it.

During my twelve days in Chicago, because Vice Counselor Shen Zuogan and Wang Sen both had their own cars, we took a "drive" along the shores of Lake Michigan several times. We drove from the Chicago Bridge all the way to Evanston, and then north to the border between Illinois and Wisconsin. This road is full of lush greenery. On Sundays, there is an endless stream of cars. Americans, regardless of age or gender, use "driving" for leisure and enjoy their youth. Just looking at the rows of cars along the shores of Lake Michigan, I thought there were more and more common than in New York.

Many Americans work in Chicago and settle their families in Evanston. Evanston is a town adjacent to Chicago. The famous Northwestern University is located on the lakeside in Evanston. There are only five Chinese students studying at Northwestern University. When they walk in town, American men, women, and children all recognize them. A police academy student named Zhao, recently graduated from the Northwestern University Police Training Program. He participated in their practical traffic control practice and was praised by the school authorities.

(V) Great Lakes Plain

I did not enter the state of Wisconsin. In northern Illinois, I visited many lovely small cities. This area is the "Great Lakes Plain" of the United States, like China's Dongting Lake Plain and Taihu Lake Plain. It is endless, all fertile land. In early summer, the red harvesters in the countryside have already started working. I visited several farm families. They said that they harvest their wheat three or four times a year. They use only machines for their farming. They are a "large-scale farm system." One farm family can manage the equivalent of more than 100 mu of land in China. Although in the countryside, they still have electricity, telephones, running water, radios, and sanitary facilities.

The fields by the lake are fertile. Their shore is only two feet above the water level of Lake Michigan. However, they have never had a flood. An American in Chicago who knows China well said: If Chicago is like Hankou, then the biggest difference between the two cities is that one has floods and the other never will. I told him that China is launching a nationwide campaign to build water conservancy projects. Once the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River is completed, wouldn't Hankou be like Chicago? He applauded!

Water conservancy has created fertile fields, and fertile fields plus industry have created the prosperity of Chicago and the prosperity of the United States. This world metropolis with the most smokestacks was still a primitive wilderness of red Indians before the mid-19th century. In 1833, the Americans defeated the red Indians and crossed Lake Michigan to arrive in Chicago.

Chicago's growth was not accidental. Historically, many great heroes contributed to the creation of Chicago. William B. Ogden was the first to build a railway for Chicago. Cyrus McCormick, the founder of McCormick Harvesting Machine Company, laid the foundation for the agricultural industrialization of the American Midwest. During the Civil War, Lincoln's support base was Chicago. Lincoln's Secretary of War said: "If McCormick's Harvesting Machine Company had not changed the agricultural system, then President Lincoln would not have won." Today, any American, east, west, north, or south, recognizes these words as truth.

(VI) Industrial and Commercial Authority

The world's two largest slaughterhouses, Armour and Swift, are both in Chicago. Armour was founded during the Civil War. During the Civil War, the American army already had an endless supply of canned food. Armour's slaughterhouse manufactured it and unconditionally supplied it to President Lincoln's Northern Army, defeating the Southern Confederate Army. After President Lincoln was assassinated, Pullman, a train merchant in Chicago, specially made "Pullman-style" sleeping cars to carry Lincoln's body back to Springfield. Later, "Pullman" became the specialized name for sleeping cars and the patented merchant for sleeping cars. To this day, all sleeping cars in the United States are called "Pullman." Pullman's car factory is also located in Chicago.

Chicago facilitated the victory of the Civil War, and the Civil War also brought Chicago an unshakable prosperity. During the Civil War, Chicago relied on its convenient lakeside transportation, absorbing the mineral deposits of Minnesota to the north and combining them with the coal of Pennsylvania to the east, stabilizing Chicago's industry. Therefore, to this day, Chicago's factories are still mostly located by the lake.

Today's Chicago landlord, Palmer, bought up land around State Street during the Civil War. Chicago's famous businessman, Marshall Field (owner of the New York Evening Post and the Chicago Sun), his predecessors established Chicago's commercial authority during the Civil War. The Chicago gangs and "circles" of "White Xiangren," the so-called "Capone"-led Chicago orthodoxy, also brewed from the Civil War era. Only eighty years have passed since the Civil War, and in those eighty years, this fertile land on the shores of Lake Michigan has been transformed into a world metropolis of industrial authority.

Social Services

### Answering Readers' Legal Questions

(I) Qian Qi has instructed the Social Services section of your newspaper to show the way and seek happiness for the public, which is deeply admired! I also have several questions: (1) My late father had five sons, A, B, C, D, and E. B died early, D was adopted by another family, and E was born to my stepmother. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, he set up a grocery store, which was destroyed by fire. He was also burdened by his children, so he lacked funds to build a house. Later, A rebuilt it alone and rented it out, with A receiving the rent. When my father passed away in 1924, A, who was sinister, demanded that a will be made on the spot. B was unwilling to sign, and D was underage and signed by his mother as guardian. Is this will valid? Are there any legal remedies? (2) The rights to the house were enjoyed until the July 7th Incident. B fled and, after returning, lived there unconditionally. To this day, the land is jointly owned, but the house was built by A. The so-called "private building on borrowed land" has been enjoyed for more than twenty years. Can the house be jointly owned or does it belong to A? (3) E's mother is still alive. Does her inheritance right still exist or has it disappeared? (4) B has no children, A now only has one son, and E has two sons. Can A's son inherit in the future?

[Lawyer Cao Yaxia's Answer] (1) A will becomes effective upon the death of the testator if it is legal. If it is not legal, the court can be requested to confirm that the will is invalid. However, the statute of limitations for this case has expired. Unless the period for exercising the right could not be observed due to the war, the right can still be exercised according to the law. Otherwise, there is no legal procedure for remedy. (2) If there is no other contract, then it should belong to the land. (3) The statute of limitations has expired. (4) No, because there is no ancestral inheritance in current law.

(II) Zhang Mengyun asked: After her uncle passed away last month, a dispute arose between her aunt and her children over the inheritance. Because her aunt was a second wife and the wedding was not held, she gave birth to a daughter, who is already twenty years old. Her son was adopted out. In this situation, how should the inheritance be distributed fairly?

[Lawyer Cao Yaxia's Answer] If the mother did not marry the father, she does not acquire the status of spouse. If the son is "adopted out," he does not take the deceased's surname and has no status as an adopted son. The daughter is the biological child and was raised by the father, so the inheritance should be inherited by the daughter.

(III) Sun Wocheng asked: In 1942, I rented a back room on the upper floor of a building in this city. There was no lease at the time, and we have been living in peace ever since. Recently, the third landlord (I am a fourth tenant) suddenly used the excuse of wanting to take it back for personal use and asked me to move out. I replied that the housing shortage is so serious now, where can I find a place? Some also want gold bars, etc. According to neighbors, they plan to deal with me by improper means. I am here to ask, if there are improper means, can I appeal to the law? Is there a right to continue the lease in law? Please answer publicly in your newspaper.

[Lawyer Cao Yaxia's Answer] (1) If you are treated with improper means, you can appeal to the law; (2) Before the lease is legally terminated, you have the right to continue to live in the lease.

### Havana! We Will Never Forget You

— Written by Qiu Ping from Pearl Harbor on the 9th

The fleet arrived in Havana, the capital of Cuba, on the morning of the 11th.

Havana is the jewel of Central and South America, with magnificent architecture and a warm climate. Hollywood often comes to Havana to shoot colorful films depicting the South American scenery. About 20,000 overseas Chinese live here and have a district. During Cuba's independence revolution, they stood shoulder to shoulder with the people and defended the city walls, shedding their blood and making a significant contribution. Therefore, Cuban historians have written in praise of the overseas Chinese: "No Chinese was a traitor, and no Chinese was a coward." However, they still face the same discrimination and oppression as overseas Chinese in other places. Although the motherland has stood up in suffering and amidst the flames of war, the overseas Chinese living far away are still living the same lives they have lived for decades. Although the motherland has been listed as one of the four great powers, "victory" overseas is just a name in the newspapers.

Since Minister Li Dijun was sent to Cuba and signed a treaty of friendship with the Cuban government, the overseas Chinese in Cuba have finally breathed a sigh of relief. However, they are still subject to depressed wages. Today, being able to see the motherland's navy, raising the flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth, sailing from the Atlantic Ocean into the port of the Cuban capital, is a true liberation in spirit.

### Chinese Fleet: Everyone Eager to See It First

The fleet docked amidst fervent cheers, with crowds packing the pier until it was impassable. "Chinese Fleet" had been a frequently used headline in newspapers for months and a fashionable term in people's conversations. People craned their necks, eager to catch a glimpse first.

The naval officers went ashore and took streetcars to the Chinese district. An amiable journalist accompanied us in visiting the Kuomintang, the Chee Kung Tong, the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, and the consulate, receiving courteous and enthusiastic welcomes. Each place prepared abundant refreshments and cold drinks to entertain. "I didn't come here to make you spend money; I came to shake hands with you." I felt deeply grateful and ashamed, but I didn't say it out loud.

At a Kuomintang elementary school, we met a young teacher who enthusiastically told us about the situation of the overseas Chinese, mentioning the decline and seriousness of overseas children's education. There are about ten thousand overseas Chinese children in Harbin, yet there is only one elementary school with about sixty students.

### Fleet Loading Provisions at Wusongkou

### Valiant Appearance of a Destroyer

### New Naval Officers and New Naval Vessels Trained in the U.S.

### Valiant Appearance of the Command Ship Tai Kang

### Salute!

— Pingzhai

After eight years of arduous and determined resistance, victorious China has gained liberation and rebirth. At the beginning of this new era, we are delighted to see our own fleet, the new navy of new China.

This fleet arrived at Wusong on the 19th of this month, including two escort destroyers and six minesweepers, such as Yong Sheng, Yong Bao, and Yong Ning, originally owned by the U.S. Navy, and gifted to China by the U.S. government after the war. From now on, the Pacific Ocean will have a new look. From now on, millions of overseas Chinese compatriots who care about the motherland will see warships flying the Chinese naval flag overseas.

Our coastline is so long - without a navy, there is no way to talk about national defense. For thousands of years, the coastal provinces have always been exposed, and as a result, these richest provinces have frequently suffered foreign threats, and the country and the nation have had to endure many humiliations in order to compromise. Today, when we wash away this long-standing shame, we should indeed make plans to remedy it as soon as possible.

Of course, in terms of quantity, this fleet is still far from meeting the actual needs, but in any case, this is a good start. The friendship of the Allied nations is indeed appreciable, but the main thing is still to rely on ourselves. It seems that we should be vigilant, and we should not underestimate ourselves. Why can't we replace Japan's position in the Pacific Ocean back then?

We want to defend ourselves. We need weapons for self-defense. We must make this good start flourish and become the most powerful and stable force on the west coast of the Pacific!

Spring and Autumn

### Delicacy and Richness

— Moyu

Most Chinese people have a very subtle and traditional view of calligraphy: that is, like the illusions woven by the "Book of Changes," they use brushstrokes to understand the writer's virtues and experiences; but its role is at most only to "understand." If we want to further clearly understand a person's character, demeanor, and how they deal with life, I think it's better to study what each person has carved with their brushstrokes in the process of life.

If a person does not slightly change his basic desires for life and even career due to origin, environment, and other objective reasons, his work may permanently maintain an unusually rich side. Conversely, his work will inevitably tend to be detached and erratic, that is, completely overwhelmed by the atmosphere of delicacy.

Genius does not necessarily express richness, because this also depends on the author's own choices in the process of life. Zhao Mengfu's calligraphy and painting are both things that make us unable to deny his genius, but between his every dot and stroke, there is no lament of a remnant subject, no somber and severe lines, and no unrestrained and flowing, weeping brushstrokes; this is the opposite of how we feel when we look at Bada Shanren's paintings. He left the court and the country, wandering around, these hardships and sufferings needed a place to pour out, so the picture constituted bloodstains and tears beyond the artistic conception. These marks are all the persistence of his life in his personality; his life path was suffocated, but there was still a glimmer of hope, and the expression of this hope in art often surpasses the achievements of genius. Zheng Xiaoxu and Wang Zhaoming certainly completed elegant and craggy shapes in their genius, but their later political life is evidence that this shape is only limited to delicacy. Like Zhao Mengfu, genius overflowed from the bottom of their lives, and the dregs of profit and opportunism filled the original gaps, and as a result, we will never see their pure, steady, and solid rich style.

A writer with a delicate style is often respectful and rebellious,拘泥 and indulgent; their hearts are always calculating how to control and use what will at least not be harmful to their reality, so they will not have big setbacks, but they will also not have the highest success, the most honorable and ideal success. This is the case with Zeng Guofan: he devoted his life to cultivating his character, neither erring nor being lazy, desperately planning his own view of life, and trying his best to suppress the accidental provocations of the environment; but he still wanted to rebel and indulge. We don't have to read his family letters and collections. Just thinking of his two sentences, "Don't remove the courtyard grass to leave life, love to raise pot fish to know the chemical machine," we can understand that he originally took the pursuit of life and chemical machine as the lofty goal beyond his career, but the result was limited by his delicate accomplishment and eventually submerged. This is what we think is very regrettable.

Shi Dakai, who failed in Zeng Guofan's hands, was a grassroots hero with infinite richness; his utterance "A great thief also has a way, poetry and books are not contemptible, gold is like dirt, liver and gallbladder are indeed like iron, ride a horse across a cliff, bend a bow and shoot at the bright moon, make a human head into a wine cup, drink all the blood of hatred" fully shows his human nature's flying, the surge of enthusiasm, and the unadorned cry against the corrupt society of the time; Later, he wrote "Entrusted to the tiger's mouth, carefully planning work, hate the thieves who do not know heroes, casually tie iron chains to flying swans, when will they grow wings, and travel ten thousand miles in the long wind; ... The six tactics and three strategies are all empty, and I want to ask the heavens about my great ambition, my brother can't go, tears spill red azaleas." It shows the revolutionary's determination not to condone failure. He sublimated his ideals from despair and did not let them be tainted with the many decadent and declining atmospheres after failure; in this way, although he failed, it did not hinder the original quality of his life; although he had the tragic cry of a hero at the end of his road, it was enough to add a layer of precious richness to his works.

There are also people who make success and failure and weaving richness form cause and effect in their lives: several orthodox scholars like Han Yu and his ilk, due to failure in their careers, became ingenious, and at the same time, because of their ingenuity, they were always unable to hold their heads high in their careers: this is entirely because they have too much restraint and affectation. Cao Mengde exchanged richness for success, and then used success to vividly express his rich personality; the former reminds us of his bold words "I would rather I betray others than others betray me"; the latter seems to make us forever remember his "For example, morning dew, there are not many days left? ...慨當以慷, it's hard to forget the sorrow". The inside shows the mind; he has ambition, has insights, does not avoid labor and resentment, does not resign from hardship, and immerses himself in a rich atmosphere throughout his life to obtain the greatest joy of life.

I have been looking forward to the rebirth of works such as Gorky, Gogol, and Lu Xun, because the world is really too barren and hypocritical; we now need to use rich wisdom to cleanse our minds, because only richness can have true joy, lovely anger, deep sorrow, and sublime joy. Only richness can make us understand life more clearly and sensitively hear the breath of this era. Delicacy cannot do these things; it can only make us degenerate and confused.

### Old Man (Fiction)

— Xie Beicheng

As soon as the weather got hot, the old man took off his bare back, picked a shady wall to sit down, and held a banana fan in his hand, for cooling and for driving away flies.

But in this dull and humid summer, he really felt too tired, and he just wanted to doze off in bursts. He didn't know where all the strength he had when he was young had gone. He gradually closed his eyes, and suddenly a swarm of flies swirled around his head. All of a sudden, it was close to his scalp, and then it flew away again. The old man slightly opened his tired eyes, and violently fanned his fan a few times:

He was a little more awake, and tried hard to open his eyes. He saw piles of old sesame seeds spread out on the grass mat in the sun in front of him. He suddenly remembered his task. His daughter-in-law had sent her to guard these things. He seemed to see his daughter-in-law standing in front of him with her eyebrows raised firmly, so he pretended to be fine and vigorously waved the fan, as if he had never dozed off.

But these eyes really didn't give face, and desperately wanted to fall down. He used all his strength to hold on to them, but he couldn't hold on. He was covered in sweat before he could look around!

There was no one around, only the straight sun shining down, only the cicadas on the trees desperately hissing:

Hiss...

So he stopped trying and let his eyes sink down at will, letting a pleasant, shady darkness cover them.

The shadows under the wall moved slowly, and no one cared; a comfortable stream of saliva dripped from the old man's mouth, and no one cared.

So the pile of old, even rotting grain spread out there was even more uncared for. Occasionally, one or two small birds braved the summer heat to pass by, landed, slowly ate their fill, and then flew away on their own, even more uncared for, as if the world was born so generous, everything was so leisurely and indifferent, just like those foreign Sinologists and Chinese Foreign Sinologists praised.

In fact, the world is not so generous, and it has not been so generous for a long time. Of course, it may have been in the past, because everyone is still yearning for the past life, when they could eat their fill, and a bag of white flour sold for two foreign coins... When they didn't have money, they could run to the door of the grain store and shout:

"Shopkeeper, give me a bag of flour on credit!"

After a while, the grain store clerk would carry the flour over. The old people of the ancient city lived such a generous life!

It's not like that now. The grain store owner shakes his head when he sees anyone:

"White flour? You must be dreaming! Now there's no corn flour to sell!"

The big pineapple outside the grain store door was upside down, basking in the sun and making a rattling sound, even more ugly than a starving beggar.

So people who have a little money in their hands try their best to exchange them for a little bit of pitiful food, whether it's white flour, sorghum rice, corn flour, bean flour, or even bean cake, all kinds of old grain that are stale, moldy, and bitter, as long as someone is willing to sell it and ask for a price, someone will buy it and carefully store it away.

The days when white flour cost two yuan a bag are long gone, and you can't chase it back no matter how hard you try.

The old man's family is naturally no exception. A family of three generations and five mouths, that mouth has to be filled:

In this world now, how difficult it is to fill your stomach! The Chinese people in the ancient city are no longer so leisurely and generous.

The old man's family is not rich, but they have not starved to death. His son works hard outside, his daughter-in-law also goes out to "sell her face," his grandson is still young, and he still runs out in the hot weather, carrying a box of ten pounds of ice on his back, shouting all over the street:

"Ice cores relieve heat, ice cores relieve heat..."

No matter how the sweat flows, the ice cubes in that box are for others to eat. In the evening? He also runs around sweating and shouting:

"Evening news, evening news, read the evening news..."

Only the old man, old, when he was young, he carried five bags of rice alone, and once he carried three big bags of smuggled salt and jumped off the city wall. He was a well-known figure, but what's the use? He is old, and the strength he had when he was young has been given to young people again. When the weather is hot, he can only lean against the shady wall and let his life slowly wear away.

Whenever the sun is fierce, the daughter-in-law thinks of the old man, also because the grains are too humid and too old. She spreads these things on the grass mat in the sun, hoping to dry off some of the damp and moldy smell, and then greets the old man:

"Watch out, Dad!"

Then she rushes out to find her life again.

That time, the old man couldn't help but sigh:

"I'm old, and they still won't let me off, a little bit of old grain and rotten sesame seeds... When I was young, I used to buy one meal at a time..."

But he had to hold back his stubbornness:

"I'm old, this is when I'm begging for food from my son!"

What can be done?

So he had to patiently guard this grain that tortured him, which was coarse and bitter.

But the world is too lonely, no one, no wind, only a few cicadas, hissing hoarsely:

"Hiss..."

Everything is too monotonous, too depressing, too lonely, just tempting people to close their eyes and let life escape in the quietness of darkness.

The old man closed his eyes and forgot everything in front of him. The strength of twenty years ago returned to his body, the slack muscles were filled again, the wrinkled skin was filled, his eyes were glowing, and he stood out from the darkness like a calf:

He re-practiced the heroic life twenty years ago:

He opened his eyes and saw the outside of the densely shaded farmhouse, the weather in the early autumn countryside, just after a good rain, and now the sky was clear; the sunset glow smeared the horizon, removing the dryness of the autumn tiger, and a new cool air covered it.

Everyone was holding a banana fan, but they didn't fan it, just because they were used to it, and they couldn't remember to throw it away even when the weather was cool.

The old man was the first to rush outside the grass wall and shouted loudly:

"How cool!"

The loud voice followed the branches of the dense forest and spread to the fields behind. The partners also crowded out:

"How cool, we have to have two cups in this weather:"

The old man laughed happily:

"I'll tell them to kill two chickens later, and we'll have a good time drinking!"

This is a life that is too familiar, as if he had experienced such a life somewhere, but now he can't find it. He carefully searched for it, letting the cool early autumn wind blow on his face.

Suddenly, a rustling sound, and a black shadow rushed out of the tree group, scaring everyone:

A man rushed over panting, his face red, panting like an air pump, rushing out his words with a light and heavy tone!

"Old, old, old, boss... that side, that side, that... pack of salt... let the running dogs... gnaw, gnaw, gnaw, gnaw... held..."

The old man was the first to jump up,

"Grandma, Grandma's x..."

He rushed into the grass wall, grabbed a white wax stick and walked out:

"Go, beat his grandma's x..."

As if he was riding on clouds and driving fog, he didn't know how he ran to the bottom of a mountain, and he didn't know how he used the white wax pole to beat back others, but finally everyone carried three big packs on their backs and ran back with big strides.

This section was very vague, but in the old man's memory, he had been pursuing it every day. He had boasted to his son about this heroic experience, but unexpectedly, he lightly returned to the lost glory.

He was very happy and threw three packs of salt into the grass hall with all his might:

"Grandma, smuggling a handful of private salt is just a bird, I carried it back with my strength:"

Then he clapped his hands:

"Kill ten chickens from his grandma, one for each person, and everyone will have a good time drinking!"

So the courtyard surrounded by the grass wall was full of:

"Cluck, cluck, cluck..."

The chickens fluttered their wings and ran all over the yard!

It still "clucked" when held in hand, and it still "clucked" when put in a pot of hot soup.

Everyone was happy, happily surrounding the pot of hot soup, watching the chickens fluttering their wings and calling in the hot soup, calling, calling, calling, it's not good!

It's not good, the hot soup pot collapsed with a bang, the chickens were on fire, running around the house, fanning around the yard, there was fire everywhere, it was very hot, sweating.

In the chaos, I don't know who slapped the old man heavily on the face:

"This old, immortal thing!..."

His body shook unsteadily, a burst of dazzling golden light flashed before his eyes, the heat all around squeezed up, and a shadow of birds fluttered their wings and flew past on his head:

"Alas alas alas..."

I often heard my daughter-in-law shouting loudly

"Drink, go—drink, go—"

"This old, immortal thing..."

The old man touched his arms, they were withered, the flesh was lost, the skin was wrinkled, and he returned to that weak old age. The glory of his early years was a shadow, flashing only in front of him. He tried hard to open his eyes, and gradually he saw that the grains spread out in front of him were scattered and thin, and three or five crows were desperately pecking at them.

His daughter-in-law, with a red face and sweat dripping, was attentively shouting and scolding:

"Drink—go, drink—go..."

"This old, immortal thing..."

This angry scolding stung the old man's heart like a needle. He lowered his head in shame and closed his eyes:

"Alas, I'm old!"

The shade had moved away from his head, and the scorching sun was shining on his scalp. He forgot everything, and let the fan fall on the ground!

His daughter-in-law was still waving her hands and shouting:

"Drink—go, drink—go..."

Suddenly, a crow fluttered its wings and flew past his head, and the tip of its wing slashed across the old man's face, and he was slapped hard.

The old man's hand subconsciously covered his face, and a burst of annoyance surged in his heart. The depletion of energy in his old age made him lose the patience to endure the youthful vitality, he suddenly opened his eyes and jumped up!

"A little bit of old grains, rotten sesame seeds, you!..."

Before he finished speaking, he looked up and saw his son standing in front of him with his head down, saying in a low voice:

"Dad, the crows have eaten all the grain!"

The old man didn't have the courage to make eye contact with his son. He secretly moved his gaze to the empty space where the grain had been:

His daughter-in-law was no longer chasing away the crows. She wiped away her tears with a dirty handkerchief, and held a broom in her other hand, gently sweeping together the remaining grains on the ground.

Outside the street, a child with a dry throat shouted:

"Ice cores relieve heat, ice cores relieve heat..."

The sun was still shining straight down, but it was getting a little west.

The old man lowered his head in shame and sighed:

"I'm old, I'm old, alas!"

Two drops of tears dripped from his dimmed old eyes, fell on the ground, and seeped down.

### White Parrot

— Painted by Huang Huanwu

### Harvest

— Engraved by Ye Fei

### Painting and Religion

— Yu Jianhua

Religion is the source of art. There is no art that does not have a close relationship with religion. Religion is inherently an ethereal and elusive thing, mysterious and intangible. In order to make people believe, it is necessary to rely on art with tangible form and color, using concrete, material things to evoke people's imagination of abstract spirit. Therefore, all religions build magnificent and grand temples. For example, Greek temples, Christian churches, Islamic mosques, Buddhist temples, Taoist monasteries, as well as national ancestral temples and shrines, and private ancestral halls, all occupy a very important and lofty position in architecture, surpassing even the imperial palaces of past dynasties. As for sculpture, people in prehistoric times had already used stone, bone, wood, and other materials to carve idols for worship. Greek sculpture is unparalleled throughout the ages. The main stone statues it carved are mostly gods in mythology. The statues in Christian churches are filled with Jesus, the Virgin Mary, and figures from the Bible. Buddhism especially values statues. Not to mention India, but in China alone, the statues of Longmen Grottoes still exist today, and the statues of Yungang Grottoes are simply unprecedented. In addition, dance originated from sacrifices to gods, music originated from honoring gods, poetry was for praising gods, and drama was for entertaining gods. As the mainstream of art, painting naturally formed an inextricable bond with religion.

When painting was exploited by politicians and had not yet been liberated, it was truly a double misfortune, yet it was also captured by religious figures. In the Middle Ages in the West, almost no painting was unrelated to Christianity. Even during the Renaissance, from Giotto to da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael, which one was not a great painter who painted the Virgin Mary, Jesus, the cross, and large paintings for churches? At that time, the subjects of paintings, with the exception of very few portraits, were completely inseparable from the Old and New Testaments. After the Renaissance, although painting gradually broke away from religion, escaped from temples to breathe some fresh air, and developed towards worldly objects, such as portrait painting, historical painting, and landscape painting, religious painting did not disappear completely. It was not until the emergence of new painting schools such as realism, romanticism, impressionism, and post-impressionism in modern times that painting completely broke away from the shackles of religion and was no longer controlled by religious figures.

The situation of Chinese painting is similar to that of Western painting in some ways. Since Buddhism was introduced to China in the Eastern Han Dynasty, it gradually developed, and the power of Buddhism spread throughout the country. The belief in Buddhism filled all levels, from emperors to common people. Its power was almost the same as that of Christianity in the Middle Ages in the West. Along with Buddhism came not only the scriptures, but also the architectural advancements of temples and the sculpture of Buddha statues. In painting, because of the introduction of Buddha statues, the worship of idols, and the encouragement of merit, 曹不興 in the Three Kingdoms period began painting Buddhas. After the Six Dynasties, Sui, and Tang Dynasties, it became the golden age of Buddhist painting. Almost all great painters painted Buddhist paintings, such as Gu Kaizhi, Lu Tanwei, Zhang Sengyao, Cao Zhongda, Wu Daozi, and Lu Lengjia, all of whom were masters in this field, and Wu Daozi was especially famous. At that time, many Buddhist temples were built, and Buddhist statues or scenes from Buddhist scriptures, such as the transformation of hell, were painted on the walls of the temples. These murals were all commissioned to famous artists of the time. Unfortunately, many Buddhist temples were later destroyed, and the murals were also lost. The only remaining ones now are the murals in the Dunhuang Grottoes. In recent years, after the discovery by Europeans and Americans and the attention of Chinese people, they have gradually spread to the world. My friend Zhang Daqian, a famous painter of today, spent more than two years living there, making copies of many murals. After the murals had been lost for thousands of years, Zhang revived them, which can be said to be a monumental achievement. However, after all, the era of Buddhist painting has long passed, and it is only an opportunity for a kind of curious and antiquarian appreciation. Buddhist painting can no longer be revived.

After the development of landscape painting in the Tang Dynasty, Buddhist painting gradually declined. By the Song Dynasty, the position of Buddhism had been completely replaced by landscape painting. Only one or two famous Buddhist painters remained, such as Li Gonglin. After that, there were no more great painters who specialized in painting Buddhas. During the heyday of Buddhism, Taoism also had considerable influence in the Tang and Song Dynasties, almost on par with Buddhism. Therefore, Chinese painting of Taoism, Buddhism, and Confucianism became a specialized subject. Although there are still people who paint Buddha statues, Arhats, Guanyin, Taishang Laojun, and the Eight Immortals, it has become a vassal of figure painting, unable to form a school of its own, and there are no more masters. The immortals and Buddhas painted now have gradually changed from religious symbols of worship to artistic objects for appreciation. Chinese painting was exploited by politicians for thousands of years and by religious figures for a thousand years. On the one hand, painting, with the power of politics and religion, flourished for thousands of years. It cannot be denied that it benefited from politics and religion. But on the other hand, because of "usurping the host's role" and "sacrificing oneself for others," painting could not develop normally, and even people misunderstood the inherent value of painting itself, which was also a great loss.

Serial Novel

### Flying Together (97)

— Zhao Qingge

Li Hua was caressed by Dong Shaoling as if she were a child. The sadness and grievances in her heart were stuck in her throat, and she couldn't speak! She wanted to tell Huang Shaoling: it's not that I can't bear to part with Kaifeng, it's that I can't bear to part with him, it's that I'm in pain because of leaving him, and that I'm sad because of leaving him. But she opened her mouth and couldn't say it! Many words crawled like earthworms in her throat, making her itch. Finally, she couldn't help but throw herself into Dong Shaoling's arms and cry!

"Don't cry! Don't cry! Xiao Hua, good girl! Don't cry!" Dong Shaoling said, patting her. He took out his own handkerchief and wiped away her tears.

Dong Shaoling was also moved, but he never realized Li Hua's deep feelings! He thought she was afraid of the unfamiliar new environment in Wuhan; he misunderstood that she was reluctant to leave Kaifeng and the girls' school, because he knew Li Hua was a very studious child. He guessed this way, so his comfort could not touch Li Hua's pain and stop her from being sad.

And Li Hua at this time, didn't blame Dong Shaoling for not being able to understand her feelings? She only blamed herself for not being able to frankly tell Dong Shaoling the truth? She hated herself for being too cowardly, but she could not break through this invisible line of shyness! Because of Dong Shaoling's tender comfort, she felt a rush of heat running through her veins. Her heart was lit with fire!

"Will you come to Wuhan too?" Li Hua finally asked in a trembling voice.

"Maybe I'll come! At that time, I will definitely go to see your plays every day!" Dong Shaoling replied with a smile, even he himself didn't know if this was reliable, because he had never prepared to go to Wuhan.

"Then, when you come, write a letter to Mr. Liu, and I will go with her to pick you up!" Li Hua said with a little relief.

"Okay. When you get there, when you have time, spend more time with Mr. Liu reading and writing; don't be pessimistic and shed tears; be happy, laugh! Do you hear me? Laugh!" Dong Shaoling told her earnestly.

"I hear you!" Li Hua nodded, and sure enough, she raised her face and smiled at him slightly.

Free Talk

### The Spirit of the Youth League

— Shao Fu

A few days ago, I wrote an article "Children's Park" and made a suggestion to the Shanghai Branch of the Youth League. The next day, I received a reply from the branch. I am very happy to introduce this letter to my readers:

Dear Editor,

I read Mr. Bu Shaofu's short article in your newspaper's supplement "Free Talk" yesterday, which made a suggestion to our league. We are very grateful for your kindness. Our office is currently dividing a portion of the land into various sports fields, including tennis, basketball, volleyball, and small ball courts, which are open to the public. On average, more than 300 to 400 people exercise every day. This measure is clearly in line with your opinion. In the future, our office will also consider the issue of renovating the Children's Park. Thank you very much for your advice.

Sincerely,

The Shanghai Branch of the Three Principles of the People Youth League July 24th

The Youth League's spirit of readily accepting good advice and acting quickly makes me both happy and gives me a lot of courage. I often have a kind of self-confidence, a self-confidence that my speaking attitude must be cautious, my basis must be objective, and the object must be an event that the public wants to shout out but cannot express. Although there are occasional shortcomings in my knowledge and a lack of depth in my observations, the motive is pure, and I welcome anyone's guidance. Therefore, I never dare to underestimate myself, thinking that "the speaker is earnest, but the listener is indifferent," and that no one takes it seriously.

As long as it's not malicious, as long as you have perseverance, people will respect your opinion. I know that the Public Works Bureau Director Zhao Zengyu is paying close attention to many of the suggestions made in this publication for improving traffic, and is already studying solutions.

I am very grateful to the branch. It has strengthened my self-confidence and increased my courage. However, I hope that the branch can promote the realization of the renovation of the Children's Park as soon as possible.

### Dedicated to Doctors

— Wu Shuangren

Shen Bao's "Free Talk" had an article on the ninth of this month, "I'm Afraid of Doctors," and another article by a Mr. X on the thirteenth, "I Love Doctors." The intentions of the two authors are completely opposite. Readers have long wanted to contribute a few words about the doctors of this year, and taking this opportunity, I will join in the fun.

I love doctors is a matter of course and also people's common feelings. I'm afraid of doctors is an angry statement, issued for a reason. Because a person cannot avoid illness, and doctors treat illness, making those who are treated return to health. Therefore, in the eyes of patients, doctors are seen as angels who save people from suffering, and should be "loved"—"afraid" is abnormal.

The author has not seen the original "I'm Afraid of Doctors," and only knows from the "I Love Doctors" article that there is such an article. So what does the original article say? I don't know. However, based on the author's observations of some doctors in recent years, I have accumulated many opinions; like bones stuck in the throat, I must express them. Now, I respectfully tell them as follows:

Birth, aging, sickness, and death are inevitable for people. If the disease is incurable and one is dying, and death is coming sooner or later, then one should accept it and not have any hope. The most important thing is non-fatal illnesses. Reviving the dying and removing the demon of disease is the doctor's duty. Whether a disease can be cured quickly is based on three conditions: first, accurate diagnosis and prescribing the right medicine; second, the timing, the sooner the treatment starts, the better; third, the doctor's medical skills and medical ethics. The author sincerely knows that there are many enthusiastic doctors who are willing to sacrifice their own flesh to save others, and who are highly skilled in medicine, and who can cure diseases with their hands. However, there are also those who are only interested in profit, who not only perfunctorily treat patients, but even deliberately delay the process; there are also those who are careless and impetuous, who examine patients casually, and use inappropriate medicines, so that acute illnesses are delayed and eventually become incurable; there are even those who know that their academic skills are limited and cannot treat the disease, but who still seek consultation fees and are unwilling to give way to others. All of these violate one or all of the three conditions, sacrificing the patient. I hope modern art can quickly improve this! The author recalls that during the enemy puppet period, the people who were injured in air raids in various places were bleeding non-stop. With great difficulty, they were sent to the hospital in freight cars, but everywhere refused to accept them; some hospitals accepted them, but did not immediately provide emergency treatment. Due to the delay, countless people were sent to the city of the dead. Recently, the tiger plague has been prevalent in various places, and hospitals have experienced the above phenomenon again because they are full. I think doctors, based on humanitarianism, should try to find ways to help as much as possible when there is no way.

Finally, there are a few additional warnings: In recent years, medical expenses and drug prices have been increasing day by day, so that ordinary patients cannot afford to see a doctor and take medicine, and therefore the number of people who die from misdiagnosis has reached a very high number. There are also too strict medical practices, such as not making house calls late at night; not making house calls on Sundays; and regardless of the patient's poverty, charging special fees for "early morning" and "late night" consultations outside of the prescribed hours. In the author's opinion: service is the first priority in life. Those who use it as a profession, of course, cannot ignore family expenses and aim to increase income. But I hope that everything has some flexibility! Especially the flexible accommodation of money and time, which is of great benefit to patients. Then those who are afraid of doctors will all become lovers of doctors.

### A Third Party's Opinion

— You Fu

All the people of Shanghai are hoping that there will be a good way to improve the traffic, so that the 3.7 million citizens can be satisfied in terms of "traveling."

I consulted my American teacher, a third party, on this issue.

When I told her about the current traffic situation in Shanghai, she very frankly gave a few points based on her ten years of experience living in Shanghai: and I hope to pass these points on to the authorities responsible for directing and managing traffic.

She said! "Why is the traffic order in Shanghai bad, and people are often run over? There are the following reasons:

1.  Various vehicles do not drive at the prescribed speed.
2.  There are too many rickshaws and handcarts in the middle of the road.
3.  When vehicles stop at intersections and then move forward, they do not follow the order of priority. In the United States, there is absolutely no such situation. The order of vehicles is not at all chaotic.
4.  Most pedestrians who are not in vehicles do not travel on the sidewalks, but walk on the road. Sidewalks are equivalent to being useless.
5.  Too many businesses do business on the road, such as newspaper stalls, mobile cigarette stalls, shoe shine stands, travel bags, combs, and other retail stalls. All of these affect traffic on the sidewalks.
6.  Rickshaws and handcarts are not allowed to pass through Nanjing Road from 8:00 to 12:00. Then, like automobiles, other small roads should also be prohibited from passing through during the above time.

If the above six problems are earnestly improved, I believe that Shanghai's traffic order will be at least much better than it is now.

I am very grateful for the opinions of this third party. Although this opinion is very ordinary, traffic is originally an ordinary matter. I'm just afraid that you can't even accept ordinary opinions, and that the methods that everyone knows, at the very least, cannot be implemented, then you can only continue to make things worse forever!

### Traitor Relying on Foreign Powers, Macao Tycoon Not Arrested

— Fang Jun

A tycoon is different from ordinary people after all. Since the Guangdong General Headquarters announced the second list of traitors, Gao Kening has been protected by the local government—Macao. According to reports in the local newspapers a few days ago: he not only has armed police escorting him in and out, but his residence also has six lines of defense, forming a fortress. This is truly majestic, not even the head of any country is like this. The "salty shrimp" authorities' so close protection made Gao Kening feel overwhelmed and grateful. From the "salty shrimp" side, they also felt it was appropriate and thorough, and they were self-satisfied and not doing anything beyond their means.

Gao Kening was originally one of the three mountains and five mountains of that place and had a reputation in Hong Kong. He has always been known as "Uncle Gao." He also supported a group of thugs in that place, not a few. Especially, his contribution to the "salty shrimp" authorities was very large. He donated monthly and paid annually, both of which were considerable and amazing figures. His contribution was also to increase the prosperity of that place a lot. He was a living "God of Wealth Bodhisattva" of that place. Perhaps, like one of the thirty-six Guanyin images in Tantric Buddhism (one of the Guanyin images in Tantric Buddhism is male), he was the "savior Guanyin" of "salty shrimp." Because in his career, he was the largest blood vessel of "salty shrimp." In fact, he was the largest life artery of "salty shrimp." Whoever cherishes the life artery. When "salty shrimp" gave him this special favor and gave him close protection, from this point of view, "salty shrimp" still wanted to cherish its largest life artery! The sudden thunder of the Guangdong General Headquarters (the second list was actually announced by the Traitor Committee) startled "salty shrimp"! But his concern for Gao Kening was not without reason!

The actual situation of "salty shrimp's" increased protection of Gao Kening is probably like this; or there may be other sufficient reasons, which are difficult to measure. However, the "thunder" of Guangdong has struck, whether there will be torrential rain, we have to wait for future practical proof. However, it is related to the "salty shrimp's" life artery. The six lines of defense around his residence are probably set up for this meaning!

What Gao Kening has today is what he never dreamed of before, a beggar singing dragon boat songs on a ferry. The beggar singing dragon boat songs held a dragon boat in his hand. The dragon boat was made of wood, about two feet long and half a foot wide, carved into an open-mouthed dragon head, painted in various colors, and attached with gold leaf. It looked elegant and refined. There were holes in the wooden pieces in front of the dragon's mouth for people to catch incense. Below the dragon's head was a boat shape, with several wooden puppets holding oars on both sides. Below, a red cloth was wrapped, with a handle in the middle, several feet long, which could be held by hand or carried on the shoulder. This is the so-called dragon boat. The beggar wore a small gong on his chest, pressed a small drum below, and held a small wooden pestle in his left hand. When singing, the sound of gongs and drums was rhythmic. The lyrics were also fixed, always some auspicious phrases. Gao Kening spent a long time on the ferry like that. How could he have expected that his gambling luck would be prosperous and he would become a "tycoon" in Macao? — The life artery of "salty shrimp." From today's situation, "salty shrimp" can't do without him. But, it seems that he can't do without "salty shrimp" either.

"The wolf cannot walk without the crippled wolf, the crippled wolf cannot walk without the wolf." Gao Kening should now call out Li Mi's famous saying: "My advance and retreat are truly embarrassing"! Then, "salty shrimp" must also say: "I cannot be where I am today without my grandmother, and my grandmother cannot finish her years without me."

However, Gao Kening can also be considered majestic. Among all the officials, when have we seen anyone receive such preferential treatment from "salty shrimp"! But be careful, it is said that after Lu Mengzheng became a high official, he could not avoid getting a cold sore on his finger and losing sight for a night. After all, a poor beggar cannot bear preferential treatment. Don't forget that when "sleeping" and "covering" the mat, in the layers of close protection, a finger stretched out, causing a cold sore and contracting an incurable disease.

A Few Words

### Holding Rice and Grain Loans, Troubles Accountants Twice

— Wuling Ren

It is rumored that after Zhou Fohai and other traitors were escorted to prison near Chongqing, they were recently discovered to be enjoying themselves in luxurious dance halls with wine and women. I dare to confirm that this news is definitely not true, otherwise a group of people in the loyal character prison would have jointly raised questions.

After the abolition of unequal treaties, the Shanghai Local Court heard two cases in which foreigners were sued. One was the case of the white sailors and the black sailors in Shanghai. As a result, the punishment suffered by the defendant, Wanda, was not very severe, but the court paid a sum of money for the witnesses' living expenses. The other was the case of the Chinese merchant Zhongyuan Shipping Company suing the British firm. As a result, Zhongyuan lost the case and had to bear more than 18 million yuan in litigation costs. These two cases can secretly make foreigners admire the impartial attitude of our court in handling cases in accordance with the law.

When the rice and grain awards were first handled, accountants had to be troubled to review them, and a corruption case occurred. Accountants also had to be asked to check the accounts. Accountants also had to attend the disaster relief dance. Accountants can be said to be "popular" to the extreme today. It is expected that they will also be troubled in the process of accepting the work of the work inspection team.

Raincoats made of glass are also sold in the windows of national goods companies, which is gratifying.

Seventeen-year-old black man Willie Francis was sentenced to death for murder. After sitting in the electric chair, he happened to survive because the electric gate was damaged. The authorities believe that it would be too cruel to execute him again, so they may commute his sentence to life imprisonment. But some people also argue that the pain of life imprisonment is said to be worse than the death penalty. In this case, then

"Putting people to death" can sometimes be said to be humane and contains the meaning of "compassion"?

### Sent to My Deceased Wife, Fengjun (18)

— Zhou Shoujuan

What is strange is that you have been gone for more than two months, but what exactly are you busy with? Why don't you come to me in my dreams? Could it be that you have become a transcendent being, forgetting all about your old companion of twenty-nine years? Could it be that you have lost your way and can no longer recognize the lanes and alleys of this old garden? Could it be that your eyes are blurred and you cannot see, among the lush greenery at the head of Wang Chang River, this wooden shed where I am now singing and weeping? Could it be that you have forgotten your beloved youngest son, Er, who has just finished his summer exams and is at home raising pigeons, and you don't want to come and see if he is being naughty? Don't you see the Ligustrum flowers blooming brilliantly at the tips of the tall poplars; don't you see the Lonicera on the Mei Qiu rocks, blooming a second time with glistening white flowers; don't you see the new lotus emerging from the water in the lotus pond under the plum house, swaying in the breeze like emerald canopies? These are all things you loved when you were alive, why don't you come and appreciate them? Alas! Feng, oh Feng! Since you don't come to me in my dreams, I don't know where to find you, so I can only tell everything to your portrait, not knowing if you can hear me or not? Sometimes, when I want something, I unconsciously call out your name, thinking that you are still by my side; sometimes, when I hear some interesting news outside, I excitedly rush back to tell you, but as soon as I step into the doorway, I suddenly realize that you are no longer in this world. Alas! Feng, oh Feng! Although your physical body is dead, your great spirit will live forever in my heart, forever immortal!

After I had you buried, I listened to the advice of my sworn brother Zhenhou and went to Shanghai for a stroll, staying at his place; he and his wife, in order to comfort me, gave me extraordinary enjoyment in terms of daily life and diet. On the eighth day of the fifth month, it was my small birthday, and they specially made noodles, prepared many dishes, and invited our children to come together; their care and concern were even greater than that of blood brothers, which truly moved me to tears, and I don't know how to repay them. I believe that your spirit in heaven must also be deeply grateful. I went to your mother's house twice to visit your mother and aunt. As soon as I saw the two old women, tears could not help but burst out of my eyes. While intermittently recounting the course of your sudden illness, I kept sobbing and could not speak coherently, and even the two of them shed many tears with me. There is also a major event in our family to report to you, which is that our daughter-in-law, Yudai, gave birth to a daughter at 7:30 in the morning of the Dragon Boat Festival at Guangci Hospital. The baby weighed nine pounds, was as white as jade and as lovely as snow. I gave her the name "Ming Ying" and gave her the gold lock piece that her father wore when he was a child. It's a pity that you can't see this lovely little granddaughter. If you saw her, you would definitely be immensely happy.

I stayed in Shanghai for two weeks, and didn't visit several old friends, because if I went, I would have to mention you, and mentioning you would pierce my heart; I believe they will forgive my suffering. My sworn brother Zheng Zipao invited me to dinner and said many powerful words of comfort. He is a very optimistic person and does not know what sorrow is; he advised me to quickly forget this sad history, like reading a book, turning the pages one by one, without having to turn back. We indeed hoped that the couple could grow old together, but those who die are dead and cannot die together, so one might as well find another partner and start anew. My sworn brother Zhenhou and the woman who I cannot forget for thirty years also sincerely advised me, saying that you have always loved me when you were alive and will certainly still care about me after death; for your sake, for the sake of the children, you must not lose heart, you must take care of your health, cheer up, and start a new family. I accepted their advice, and a surge of vitality was added to my body and mind. I decided to start anew and console you in the afterlife.

### Terror, Destruction, Degeneration. The Imagined Third World War - A Speculative Discussion, Listen to it as Such.

— Ying Dai

This is the story of the Third World War. Atomic weapons have been developed to an extreme level. Talented scientists skillfully use these terrifying weapons. The extreme terror of life and matter is arbitrarily manipulated by the great powers. In the first two days of the war, all the major cities in the world and their residents were reduced to ashes.

Building Underground Cities

Anticipating such terror of war, these countries have secretly built many underground cities thousands of feet deep, because these cities are not afraid of atomic weapon bombings, and military leaders, once they begin operations, lead the people to move to underground cities in remote corners of the earth to ensure safety. However, human perseverance can end a global war. Unexpectedly, there are weapons more powerful than atomic bombs and rockets that can be thrown into the final arena. A kind of wireless radio wave melts all metals within a diameter of one hundred miles into liquid slurry. At first, people did not expect its consequences to be so terrifying. Until an airship used an invisible electric light to shoot at the enemy's position, all the cannons, tanks, airplanes, atomic weapons, warships, railways, and all metal objects were pierced by the light wave and melted into liquid slurry. Telephones, radios, electric clocks, electrical appliances, gas, and water supply facilities were all destroyed overnight. Electric wires and iron pipes were softened and bent by the wireless radio wave.

Metal Completely Melted

Skyscrapers and bridge towers were pulverized. Ordinary houses completely disintegrated when steel frames and iron nails melted into liquid slurry. It even made it impossible for the other side to continue fighting with a single iron knife. There was no way to go but unconditional surrender. Later, this secret was detected by spies from a third country, who immediately launched a surprise attack on the first country. After the war broke out, the terrifying situation continued for many days, even more terrifying than a night of harvest. Even airplanes carrying this new type of weapon suffered the same fate as all weapons in the world. When the cities below the ground, built with steel pipe concrete, with honeycomb-like caves inhabited by millions of residents, were bombed, they only expressed surprise at the machine age.

Returning to the Stone Age

Thus, due to their intelligence, mankind returned from the atomic age, through the electrical age, the Bronze Age, and the Iron Age, and all the paths of evolution, back to the Stone Age. Everything produced from thousands of years of effort was destroyed. From then on, the only tools that humans could manufacture were stone knives and wooden sticks, which were very crude. But the belligerent countries still fought. The weapons used by Stone Age humans were not stone knives and stone spears, but a powerful weapon - microbes. They freely multiplied in the embers after a considerable period and filled the ground, but people did not know their harm. So they could invade humans as much as they wanted, and those masters who created the war were busy killing each other, neglecting this invisible enemy. Microbes have penetrated into all the people in the world. Most of the houses on the ground are covered with mud and grass, and only a few survive, but even they have incomplete doors and windows and collapsed walls.

Disaster Descends on the World

However, it was too late, and several terrible events were about to come. Natural disasters, due to human negligence, suddenly arrived. The electric light that melted metals further affected the ore seedlings buried deep underground. Gradually, but terribly, the rock layers began to move and adjust themselves. Earthquakes occurred everywhere, mountains moved, and vast lands buried countless people. Animals were lucky and could kill any living thing. New volcanoes appeared all over the earth, and piles of molten minerals made the earth's surface extremely fragile. Bursting volcanoes spewed out a kind of molten metal with radio wave effects. At night, the flowing light was everywhere, frightening people. All animals and plants that touched this poisonous gas were completely poisoned. Sinking volcanoes emitted huge amounts of steam, making the air on the ground unsuitable for human breathing.

Total Destruction of Mankind

Due to the collapsing mountains, steaming lakes and seas, uneven roads, burning sparks, and the cries of humans, the earth was slowly transformed into a hellish disturbance. After a few months, the earthquakes rumbled and sank to the bottom, and finally after the silence, the earth was quiet again, only mankind was completely destroyed. When the moon raised its head again and shone on the familiar earth, it only saw huge stone walls, dazzling lake light, and a piece of loneliness, painted blue on the surface of the earth.
