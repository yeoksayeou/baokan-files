Chairman Wang Lingji of Jiangxi Province and government officials in the mountains lined up on the streets to await him respectfully. The Marshal frequently nodded in thanks from his sedan chair, and proceeded directly to No. 40, Xihe Road, to rest. At dusk, he and his wife visited the US military reception center at No. 46 and took a short walk on the road by the stream outside the gate.

### Marshal Carries Recommendation Book; Personally Delivers to Chairman

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] Political negotiations are unlikely to be held in the near future due to Zhou Enlai's trip to Shanghai and Marshall and Stuart's trip to Lushan. However, Yu Dawei visited Marshal twice before his departure this morning. The first time was from 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM. Twenty minutes later, Yu returned and spoke for only five minutes before departing. The twenty minutes of round trip may have been to negotiate something at a nearby location and then convey the results to Marshall. After Yu's departure, Marshall drove to the airport, arriving at 1:08 PM. It is reported that Marshall's trip to Lushan is to relay to Chairman Chiang the meetings he has had with Zhou Enlai and others over the past two months, especially to discuss the current situation with Chairman Chiang. It is also reported that Marshall and Ambassador Stuart spent a day and a half studying China's terrain and are said to have drafted a recommendation, the content of which was drafted after extremely careful research. This book will be personally delivered to Chairman Chiang by Marshal.

### Zhou Enlai Receives Reporters; Actually Publicly Slanders the Government; And Insults Chen Lifu

[Our City Dispatch] CCP Representative Zhou Enlai received the press in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, attended by sixty or seventy Chinese and foreign reporters. Zhou reported three points: (1) Recent battle situation: (A) Central Plains area, (B) Shandong area, (C) Subei area, (D) Northeast area. Zhou stated: Except for the Northeast area where the war is gradually subsiding, the battles in the other war zones are fierce. (2) Regarding the Kunming Incident, the assassinations of Wen Yiduo and Li Gongpu, Zhou expressed his indignation and demanded that the government conduct a thorough investigation. (3) Regarding the Yellow River blockage and the Executive Relief Administration's relief to the CCP areas, he has had detailed discussions with Director Chiang Tingfu.

[Associated Press, This City Dispatch] Zhou Enlai denied, yesterday while receiving reporters, that the Communist Party has taken the initiative in the current war, accusing the government of launching a planned attack in four provinces and "taking assassination measures" to undermine China's democratic movement. Zhou pointed out that Chen Lifu ordered the secret police to draw up a blacklist of freedom fighters, and said: "The reactionary countercurrent" has spread across the country.

[This City Dispatch] Yesterday (18th) at 3:00 PM, when Zhou Enlai received foreign reporters at his residence on Route Massenet, he said: "Chen Lifu's visit to Shanghai this time is to strengthen the secret service organization and deploy new political assassinations." A reporter from the Central News Agency made a special visit to Chen to inquire about his feelings regarding Zhou Enlai's remarks. According to Chen's reply: "My visit to Shanghai this time is to examine my health and to seek the suffering of the industrial and commercial sectors in order to report to the Central Government and seek improvements. Zhou Enlai's remarks are not based on facts, and are intended to create social panic, damage the government's reputation, and constitute public insults and defamation to me personally. I will formally protest to Zhou and urge him to make a formal correction and pay attention to the legal and political responsibilities he bears."

### Hu Shih Arrives in Shanghai; Feels Many Emotions About the Current Situation

[This City Dispatch] Dr. Hu Shih, President of Peking University, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing on the morning of the 18th. Yesterday, he met with reporters at the hotel and said: Judging from the trends of various countries in the world, China should move in the direction of democracy. He said with emotion: After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the people saw the light again from the darkness. Unexpectedly, the recent war has not yet ended. Hu expressed great sympathy for the plight of the people of Subei who are in deep water and fire. He also explained that political problems are built on the foundation of economic and social problems. Improving China's current situation cannot be achieved by solving political problems alone. The only current hope is to stop military conflicts, reduce military expenditures, and restore the economy to a normal path before discussing other matters. Finally, talking about Peking University's repatriation plan, Hu explained that the books and instruments of Peking University during the war have not suffered significant losses. However, when the professors and students of Kunming Branch can return to Peking to start classes cannot be predicted under such difficult transportation conditions. Hu is currently in Shanghai negotiating transportation and will go to Peking with his wife to take over affairs in the short term. Qiu Sinian, the acting president of Peking University, will also fly to Peking from Nanjing within the next few days.

### Military and Political Chiefs of the Northeast and North China Hold a Joint Meeting in Beiping; Discuss Strengthening Connections to Deal with the Situation

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 18th Dispatch] After Gu Zhutong and Xiong Shihui arrived in Beiping, there was an important military and political special meeting here today. The meeting lasted from 11:00 AM to over 1:00 PM before adjourning. It is not yet known whether it will continue tonight as of the time of the dispatch. It is reported that those who attended the meeting today, in addition to Gu and Xiong, included Li Zongren, Sun Lianzhong, Neng Bin, Zhang Jia'ao, Lu Han, and Wang Hongshao, Chief of Staff of the Beiping Pacification Headquarters, and Song Kentang, staff officer of the Commander's Office. It is also learned that Commander Zhang Ting'e has also been summoned to Beiping and may participate in the meeting. The main topic of discussion at this joint military and political meeting between the Northeast Pacification Headquarters and the Beiping Pacification Headquarters is generally speculated to be to strengthen the connection between North China and the Northeast to be able to deal with the current situation. Judging from the fact that the giants Gu, Xiong, and Zhang arrived on the day Li Zongren returned from his inspection of Shanxi and Suiyuan, it can be seen that this kind of speculation is extremely reasonable. At present, under the circumstances that the Tianjin-Pukou Railway has not been restored and maritime transportation is not smooth, the National Army in the Northeast actually relies on Tianjin and Beiping as its rear. However, the area around Tianjin and Beiping is narrow and relies on the Northeast for food supply. Therefore, how to consolidate the Beiping-Nanjing Railway corridor under the threat of the Communist Army, and how to promote the coordination and adjustment between the Northeast and North China, are important issues at present. Therefore, Gu and Xiong have taken the measure of inspecting the Beiping-Nanjing Railway and visiting Beiping. After Gu, Xiong, Zhang, and Lu arrived in Beiping last night, they went to Mayor Xiong's banquet. At around 11:00 PM, they attended the Commander's Office's welcome party and dispersed at 2:00 AM. Tonight, the Commander's Office will still have a entertainment party. It is not yet known when Gu and Xiong will leave Beiping.

[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 18th Dispatch] After Gu Zhutong, Xiong Shihui, and Zhang Jiaji passed through Tianjin on the 17th to go to Beiping, the military authorities in Tianjin, Corps Commander Mu Tingfang of the 94th Corps and Deputy Corps Commander Yang Wenjing, went to Beiping together on the afternoon of the 18th. When reporters met Xiong at the station yesterday, Xiong did not say what mission he had. However, all parties believed that the nature was not ordinary. Zhang Jia'ao told reporters on the train that the industry and mining in the Northeast are now slowly recovering, and the takeover work is also being expanded one after another. Zhang said that the main problem in restoring industry and mining in the Northeast is the power problem, which is now being gradually rectified.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 18th Dispatch] Lu Han, Chairman of Yunnan Province, came with Gu Zhutong and Xiong Shihui yesterday and stayed at the Commander's Office. When reporters visited him this afternoon, Lu politely declined, saying "I am ordered not to make a statement." It is learned that Lu's trip to the Northeast this time is to comfort the two armies under his command that were transferred to the Northeast. After staying briefly in Beiping this time, he will return to Kunming via Nanjing (or Lushan). The saying that he will take office in the Northeast seems inaccurate.

### Should Notify All Committees Before Taking Important Action
### Far Eastern Conference Passed British Representative's Proposal Yesterday
### Next Meeting Scheduled for September 18

[Our Newspaper] The "United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" Far Eastern Conference continued to be held in the Bank of China yesterday morning at 11:30, with Jiang Tingfu as chairman. After the meeting, a debate on the proposal of British representative Mr. Stander yesterday continued. American representative Mr. Gilpatrick said: The conference does not want to judge the merits of the UNRRA Director's suspension of supplies to China. He believed that the Director's move was not so much due to past improprieties as it was a desire to be vigilant in the future. The Soviet representative requested more materials. Jiang Tingfu said: The "UNRRA" Director's move was indeed dictatorial, and advocated that in the future, the Director's Office should notify all committees before taking similar actions. The case was passed with slight modifications to the details, but the two main points in the original proposal, expressing disapproval of the "UNRRA" Director's action and advocating that all committees should be notified in advance in the future, were not amended.

Then the date and location of the next meeting were discussed. The conference is held every two months, and it was decided to hold it in Shanghai on September 18 this year. Jiang said: In early September, the Executive Yuan will hold a national conference to review the work of various branches and departments.

Since the representatives had no suggestions, the meeting was adjourned immediately. At the adjournment, Jiang announced that a cocktail party would be held at 4:30 p.m. to celebrate the new marriage of Mr. Lai, Director of the "UNRRA" China Office. The tense and serious atmosphere in the meeting place suddenly changed to lighthearted, and Mr. Lai was especially beaming. Jiang also expressed his deep appreciation on behalf of the conference for the contributions of the former "UNRRA" China Office Director Mr. Carey, and for the harmonious feelings among colleagues. The conference then ended in a round of applause.

There were three main points of discussion: First, the allocation of funds for the Yellow River project and the treatment of project personnel; second, the relief methods for the people in the Yellow River flood area and the distribution of engineering equipment; third, the distribution of food and relief in the CCP area. The talks lasted from morning to 11:30 am and continued at 6 pm, ending at 9 pm. It is understood that an agreement had been reached on the Yellow River breach closure issue on May 15 this year, and work began immediately. It has been two months now, and the crux of the problem is still the economic problem and other trivial matters in the progress of the work, resulting in the work not progressing smoothly. The plan agreed at that time was divided into two parts: (1) Embankment restoration work: The CCP is responsible for the engineering aspects of the work. The entire plan has been reviewed and approved by Chinese and foreign engineers and is scheduled to start work. The government is responsible for funding, equipment relief, and work relief; (2) Breach closure problem: At present, the flood area has expanded, and the work is invisibly obstructed, so relief work is more important in the work of breach closure. After this meeting, a preliminary agreement has been reached on the project, and it has been decided that the total project cost is 8 to 10 billion yuan, divided into cash and equipment. Most of the funds have been paid, and the Yellow River repair and closure work may continue. Secondly, regarding the relief issue in the CCP area, Zhou Enlai stated that the CCP requested to participate in the work of various departments of the Executive Yuan and believed that UNRRA's relief in China would end in 1947. The CCP requested more distribution. Mr. Zhou had a detailed discussion with Mr. Jiang on this issue.

Xue Dubi Discusses Prioritizing Embankment Restoration

According to Mr. Xue Dubi's announcement to reporters, the CCP had requested the government to quickly allocate 10 billion yuan in project funds based on the consultation on May 18, but there was no such record in the previous consultation. In fact, the Water Conservancy Commission had allocated project funds to the Executive Yuan three times, 3 billion the first time, 1 billion the second time, and recently 2 billion, totaling 6 billion. Because it was decided during the last consultation that the Water Conservancy Commission would raise funds for urgent projects in the CCP area. However, the record only contains the words "sufficient project funds" and does not mention 10 billion. In order to save the people, the government is willing to cooperate sincerely and will not argue over words. In the future, the engineer Todd can conduct an on-site investigation, formulate a budget, and send it to the Water Conservancy Commission, which will then forward it to the Executive Yuan for allocation. However, the right to approve is in the Executive Yuan, and the right to allocate funds is in the National Treasury. This must be stated. There are a total of 1,400 meters of breaches in the Yellow River, and 400 meters remain unblocked. Because three-quarters of the breached area is in the CCP area, and the embankments have been in disrepair for many years, if the breaches are closed suddenly, it will cause flooding. Therefore, it is necessary to restore the embankments first. It is hoped that the CCP can cooperate to complete the embankment restoration before the end of October and complete the entire project before the end of the year.

The reporter then visited Mr. Wu Yunfu, representative of the CCP, and learned that the emergency projects in the CCP area require approximately 8 to 10 billion yuan in labor and materials. The CCP has mobilized 230,000 workers and divided the areas to be repaired into five "repair and defense areas" to carry out work according to Todd's plan. When the Yellow River changes course, approximately 200,000 people will need relief.

### Beijing High Court Scheduled to Publicly Try Zhou Zuoren Today

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The Capital High Court will publicly try Zhou Zuoren, a notorious cultural traitor of North China, at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow. According to the indictment, as early as August of the 28th year of the Republic of China, Zhou colluded with the traitor Tang Erhe of the puppet North China Provisional Government and served as the dean of the College of Arts of the puppet Peking University, and successively served as a standing member of the puppet North China Political Affairs Committee and concurrently the supervisor of the puppet Education General Administration, president of the puppet East Asian Literature Association, chairman of the North China branch of the puppet Sino-Japanese Cultural Association, and president of the North China Xinbao Newspaper.

### Cases of Abduction and Trafficking of Young Girls in Beiping City
### Hebei Supervisory Office Files Impeachment
### Acknowledging That the Chief of the Seventh Sub-bureau of the Internal Police Bureau Committed Illegal Abuse of Power

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 18th] The abduction and trafficking case of messenger Ye Qiming occurred at the New New Cinema last month. Because a few newspapers expanded the publication based on one-sided information, it caused a disturbance in Beiping City and also led to the issue of certain agencies taking over the theater. The case was heard by the criminal court of the district court on the morning of the 16th. The interrogation ended at 1:00 p.m., and a date was set for continued hearing. The Hebei Supervisory Commissioner's Office attaches great importance to this case. After careful investigation, it believes that Jin Zhi, chief of the Seventh Sub-bureau of the Internal Police Bureau of the Beiping Police Bureau, handled the case with illegal abuse of power. The impeachment letter to the Municipal Government was published on the 16th, stating: "During the various interrogations of the perpetrators, the impeached person used torture to coerce confessions. According to the results of the investigation by personnel sent by this office, the case is not as serious as claimed by the sub-bureau, but is only a more serious case of abduction and trafficking. The trafficked and defiled girls, Wang Taili and Peng Yayu, etc., also did not admit that Ye committed the crime of defiling them with drugs. Even the local court has not been able to obtain conclusive evidence of the use of drugs. It was also found that a group of perpetrators were detained in the Seventh Sub-bureau of the Internal Police Bureau until June 10 before being sent to the police station. The sub-bureau detained them for more than 20 days, which is a clear violation of laws and abuse of power. In handling the New New abduction and trafficking case, the impeached person illegally detained seven innocent people, including Xiao Hanyuan and Liu Jiancai, arbitrarily implicating the innocent, and being incompetent to people and trampling on the human rights of the people. After the abduction and trafficking case occurred, the impeached person arbitrarily sealed off the New New Theater. The crimes of the employees have nothing to do with the property rights of the theater. This measure is obviously inappropriate. Combining the circumstances of the case, the impeached person clearly constitutes illegal abuse of power."

### Local Dispatches

The 8th Company of the National Army Stationed in Thailand Breaks Through and Reaches Jingcheng

"Our newspaper's Jingjiang dispatch" The 8th Company of the 56th Regiment of the National Army stationed at Shilidian, Taixing, was surrounded by the communist army for two days and one night. The communist army launched more than ten assaults with two regiments, but they were all repelled. Later, Commander Liu of Taicheng, believing that the company was defending a corner alone and the city defense was surrounded, unable to provide assistance, instructed them to break through and return to the city immediately. The company broke through on the morning of the 15th. Because Taixing was under attack and they couldn't enter the city, they entered Jing territory along the Yang-Jing Highway. They encountered the communist army several times along the way. They finally reached the vicinity of the Sanguan Temple outside the west gate of Jingcheng around 4:00 PM, resting there. There were eighty-one soldiers and four wounded soldiers, led by Company Commander Lu Yonggui. Upon hearing the news, the shops outside the west gate brought condolences to comfort them.

Zhang used a peach-paring knife and stabbed his wife in the head three times, and once each on her left cheek and next to her mouth. Blood flowed like a river. Zhang, seeing that he had caused trouble, stabbed himself in the head with the knife, fell to the ground in extreme pain.

According to their confession, one was Yuan Huosheng, the village head of the Fourth Bao of Datong Township in the district, and the other was Yuan Changsheng, a villager of the same bao. Yuan Huosheng, as a village head, dared to destroy the dam, showing blatant disregard for the law.

Wuxi - A Shocking Murder Case

On the morning of the 28th of the fourth month of the lunar calendar this year, he went to Li She Zhen with his medicine kit to sell eye medicine. He was arrested without any reason by Yu Zuogang, the head of the town's self-defense force (currently the township head), Jiang Dexin, the deputy head of the force, and Wang Bingzhong, a member of the force. He was tied to a tiger bench and subjected to severe torture. Sun screamed in agony and fainted. After being splashed awake with cold water, he was subjected to further cruel torture and locked in a room, where he died from his injuries. Commander Yu ordered more than ten members of the force to carry the body to Dangtan in the dead of night to bury it, intending to cover up the traces. The incident was discovered by the deceased's father, Sun Linrong, who reported it to the Anzhen Police Station and the headquarters of the 9th Engineering Company, requesting the arrest of the murderers and the redress of grievances. After receiving the report, the police station, together with the company headquarters, went to investigate and confirmed the facts. Unexpectedly, the self-defense force and others had already fled upon hearing the news, and only one accomplice, Wang Bingzhong, a member of the force, was arrested. He confessed to the crime of privately torturing, killing, and covering up the traces. The body of Sun Jiadao has now been found on the Dangtan beach in Zhou Wu Township, Shiqing County, on the border of Changshu.

Editorial

### The Trend of Assassination Must Not Be Allowed to Continue!

Recently, three assassination cases have occurred in Kunming, causing great shock in society, and the government also attaches great importance to them. Li Gongpu was assassinated on the evening of the 11th, Professor Wen Yiduo was assassinated by thugs on the afternoon of the 15th, and Inspector Xie Cheng of the Kunming Garrison Command was also assassinated on the same afternoon, suffering injuries all over his body. Whether using guns or knives, all three have died. In the same place, not long apart, assassination cases have occurred repeatedly. The local authorities, especially the military and police chiefs, really cannot shirk their responsibility. Let us close our eyes and imagine what kind of world Kunming has become today! Kunming is a major city in the Southwest, with picturesque scenery. Who would have known that demons are rampant and thugs are rampant to such an extent? Someone should be responsible for local security. The Chairman of the National Government's order to arrest the murderers within a time limit and punish them severely according to law is a responsibility that the provincial authorities cannot shirk. We believe that Chairman Lu Han should return to Yunnan immediately and take the arrest and severe punishment of the murderers as his own responsibility.

The reason why we attach importance to the Kunming assassination case is not because of some political dispute, but because we believe that this is a question of whether local security can be maintained by law. Furthermore, we advocate the rule of law. The rule of law is the basic spirit of democratic politics. All actions that undermine the rule of law and damage the rule of law are resolutely opposed by us. Assassination is the most despicable means, the most contrary to human conscience, and also the means that most damages the dignity of the law. The trend of assassination must not be allowed to continue! If the trend of assassination is allowed to grow, then, in the extreme, bandits will be rampant, and the lives of the people will have no guarantee. Local security will be out of the question, and the country will no longer be a country. Therefore, regardless of the motive for assassination, for the sake of the country and for the sake of society, only strict sanctions can curb the source of great chaos. There is no other method to sanction assassination than the eight characters: "arrest the perpetrators and punish them severely according to law." Because to stop illegality, we can only rely on "law". Punishing by law is the only way to eliminate assassination. If we put aside the arrest and punishment of the murderers, what good will it do to discuss endlessly?

On the one hand, we advocate that the Kunming assassination cases must be thoroughly investigated and severely punished. On the other hand, we do not want to echo the current commentators, clamoring and making noises. Without clarifying the truth, we rush to conclusions, thinking that this is "political assassination." In addition to Li and Wen, there is also the Xie Cheng case, which shows that Kunming's criminals are rampant and have become a trend. We must not make a fuss about a minor issue and fuel the flames. The CCP delegation submitted a written protest to the "government representative" for the Li and Wen cases, and Zhou Enlai also expressed to Special Envoy Marshall that "assassinations occur repeatedly in the rear, and negotiations cannot continue," and Professor Pan Guangdan and others want to ask the Kunming US consulate for protection, all of which are a bit too much. Li Gongpu was originally an enthusiast of social education, and Professor Wen Yiduo was a scholar who studied the Book of Songs most thoroughly. Although they have discussed national affairs in recent years, they are ultimately just ordinary so-called "cultural people." Even if they have political enemies, why do political enemies have to resort to assassination to put them to death? If it is said that there is such a thing, and negotiations cannot continue, then does that mean that the heavy artillery fire in northern Jiangsu, Shandong, and the borders of Henan and Hubei does not hinder the continuation of negotiations? Therefore, we believe that everyone should only try to find ways to stop the assassination on this main topic, and do not need to involve it in political issues and make a hard sell of expansion and propaganda.

There is another rumor circulating outside, and we dare not readily believe it judging by common sense. Recently, it was reported that there are secret CCP documents saying that their "agents cooperate, and their activities have turned from secret to individual public activities," and even have the words "incite assassination," so before the Kunming assassination case occurred, there were people who seemed to be frightened by such claims everywhere. However, we believe that such speculation is also unnecessary at this time, otherwise, it will only lead to self-disturbance. Because no matter how clever, the technique of scapegoating can never cover up the eyes and ears of the world. Therefore, we still advocate that once the Kunming tragedy has been found, wait for the central officials to conduct a secret investigation on the spot, and it will not be difficult to get to the bottom of the matter. We must urge the government to arrest the perpetrators as soon as possible and punish them severely according to the law. Everything else is empty talk. And the authorities currently responsible for Kunming's security should especially work hard to solve the case and slightly make up for their negligence in prevention.

In short, we must resolutely say from the standpoint of humanity, the standpoint of law, the standpoint of the rights of the people, and the standpoint of local security and national order: The trend of assassination must not be allowed to continue! And the method to curb the trend of assassination is extremely simple. As long as the central and local authorities strictly investigate and punish the perpetrators according to the law in any assassination case, then stubborn thugs will no longer dare to test the law in the future.

### Turkish President Delivers Election Speech, Urges Nationals to Support the Government, Deeply Suspicious of Soviet Expansionist Policy, Maintaining One Million Regular Troops is Necessary

[United Press Istanbul, 18th] Turkish President Inonu broadcast a speech today, asking the public to support the People's Party in the election on the 21st of this month. He stated, "Turkey hopes to obtain a certain peace immediately, but it is still necessary to maintain the full mobilization of its army, as in the past three years. The Nile issue and the 'security' of Istanbul may occur quickly. (Note: The Soviet Union will express concern over the Tatar Nile Strait connecting the Black Sea and the Mediterranean.) Turkey has long been troubled by suspected Soviet seizure, so it maintains its army's preparedness for action, and Istanbul is still under martial law."

[Reuters Istanbul, 17th] Although the two major Turkish political parties are constantly scolding each other, it seems that there is no great difference in their opinions on foreign and domestic policies in the upcoming election next week. Both sides call for the support of democratic politics in the sense of Western countries. One is the Republican People's Party led by Ismet, and the other is the Democratic Party led by Bayar, which represents the opposition. In terms of the policies of the two major parties, both oppose ceding even an inch of land to other countries, which is the most concerning issue for the Turkish people. Other matters accused by the opposition parties seem to be secondary. Therefore, under the circumstances of increasing foreign aggression, the public cannot help but have the psychology of preferring to maintain the status quo in order to resist foreign countries.

Do Not Change Horses While Crossing the River, A New Broom Can Sweep Clean

Election Slogans of the Two Major Political Parties

The Republican Party's political view is "Do not change horses while crossing the river," while the opposition party advocates "A new broom can sweep clean." The "river" referred to by the Republican Party refers to the current serious stage, deeply aware of the Soviet Union's expansion of territory, so it has to maintain one million regular troops and national defense expenditures. Because the Soviet Union has not yet given up its demands for a base in the straits, and Greek leftists are also demanding land in European Turkey. Recently, Professor Takaisvili of the Georgian Republic has reiterated his previous remarks, demanding land from Turkey, and the French Communist Party has also resolved to support the annexation of Turkey's Kars Province and Ardahan Province into the Soviet Union, and to make Kurdistan and Cilicia independent. Moscow Radio criticizes the Turkish government almost every day, and Turkey's communist party is also secretly active.

### Tenth Anniversary of the Spanish Civil War, Franco Delivers a Speech, Signs of Cabinet Reshuffle, Communist Party Becomes Active Again

[Our newspaper's report] London, 18th broadcast: Today is the tenth anniversary of the Spanish Civil War, Franco delivered a speech, admitting that Spain has military power beyond normal times because the border is "threatened."

[France News Agency, Madrid, 18th] There is a phenomenon of nervousness and half-belief in Spanish political circles. Several cabinet members feel that the cabinet may be reshuffled, and their positions will be threatened to some extent. But how General Franco's intention is still elusive. The cabinet held a long meeting the night before, which reportedly lasted all night. Some observers pointed out that the cabinet reshuffle may be extended to September or even October this year. At the same time, yesterday was the anniversary of the revolution. The Falange usually holds its annual meeting on this day, but it did not hold it. The Falange leader sent small groups to discuss the current situation, and there was a feeling of distress.

[Reuters Madrid, 17th] After months of silence, the Spanish Communist Party has recently become active again. The party newspaper "Worker's World" has recently reappeared and has been changed to a weekly. The past temporary silence may be due to the party's internal reorganization. The Communist Party's guerrilla activities have completely stopped, whether it is due to a change in policy or an inability to carry them out is still unknown.

[France News Agency, Madrid, 17th] The Spanish government has reached an oral agreement with the government of the Italian Republic to recognize it in principle, and the Italian representative stationed in Spain will be promoted to ambassador.

[Reuters Belgrade, 17th] Yugoslav Assistant Minister Kardelj recently declared that the South Slav government will oppose the decision of the four foreign ministers to jointly manage Trieste internationally. We only hope that the allies can be consistent in word and deed and carry out the promise to completely eliminate fascism and aggression made at that time.

### He Yingqin Arrives in San Francisco, Talks about the Far East Situation, Scheduled to Fly to Government Today

[United Press San Francisco, 17th] He Yingqin, the Chinese representative to the United Nations Military Staff Committee, arrived here on his way to New York to attend a meeting. He said here today that the intermittent wars in North China are not serious, and the Chinese government is determined to solve any political problems by political means. Special Envoy Marshall's mediation for peace in China has benefited China greatly. The Chinese government believes that domestic peace is closely related to Far Eastern peace and world peace, and appreciates Marshall's efforts. He Yingqin met with MacArthur when he passed through Tokyo. It is said that MacArthur's decision to allow the Japanese to try democracy for the first time in two thousand years can also be said to have benefited the Japanese people greatly. He Yingqin also said that he personally fully agreed with MacArthur's policy. He Yingqin is scheduled to fly to Washington on the 19th.

### French General de Gaulle May Make a Comeback, Most Major Political Parties Express Support

[France News Agency, Paris, 17th] Reliable sources: If the political parties support French anti-war hero General de Gaulle, he is willing to serve as the President of the French Fourth Republic. Regarding this matter, the leaders of the major French political parties, from the far right to the socialist, have met with General de Gaulle and asked him to accept the position of President after General de Gaulle gave an implication in his speech on June 18, even if the future constitution is not completely agreed by him. It doesn't matter. It is said that General de Gaulle has already agreed, but hopes that all parties will unanimously agree.

### Six Hundred British Members of Parliament Jointly Oppose Franco

[France News Agency, London, 17th] Six hundred members of the British Parliament jointly published a front page in the newspaper today, calling on the British government to take action to help the Spanish people regain their freedom through the United Nations. The letter stated briefly: July 18 is the anniversary of Franco's revolution against the legitimate constitutional and democratic government. We believe that the current government of Spain is an illegal usurpation and it is difficult to tolerate its existence. We firmly believe in sound democratic principles, and the leader of the Spanish Republican Party, Giralt, has formed a government based on these principles. We hope that Spain will soon be able to break away from the control of Fascist autocracy and join the ranks of liberated countries. The signatories of the letter include Minister Greenwood, the son of State Minister Buck, and former Undersecretary of State Brooks, etc.

[Reuters Alexandria, 17th] When the military club here held an outdoor dance party in the evening, someone suddenly threw five grenades from outside, injuring a total of 25 people, including 12 women, 2 Egyptian waiters, and the rest were British military officers, including four seriously injured.

Someone saw a black car speeding away after the incident. The British soldiers fired a shot at the car, and it is said that the car was hit. It is expected that it will not be difficult to capture the criminals.

### Brazilian Government Breaks Up Japanese Black Dragon Society

[Reuters Sao Paulo, Brazil, 18th] The Brazilian branch of the Japanese "Black Dragon Society" assassinated three prominent Japanese expatriates here in the past ten weeks. The Brazilian police began investigating and have now solved the case. About 100 Japanese will be deported, and many more will be detained. The purpose of this secret group is to "eliminate" all Japanese who do not believe that Japan will defeat the Allied countries, causing panic among the 250,000 Japanese residents here. Now that the case has been solved, they can rest assured from now on. According to the police, the investigation took many weeks before they arrested the leader. Four more people were about to be "eliminated" by them, and now they have been spared.

### Collapse of the Japanese Mitsui Zaibatsu

Family Meeting Decides to Dissolve

[United Press Tokyo, 17th] According to responsible sources today: The Mitsui family meeting has decided to dissolve, which is probably the first step in the collapse of the Mitsui Zaibatsu. The total value of all the assets of the Mitsui Zaibatsu is more than 25 billion yen. The decision to dissolve must be approved by the occupying forces. The occupying forces will probably review whether this dissolution is deliberately evading taxes or circumventing the orders of the occupying forces. The Mitsui family meeting was established in 1722, with Mitsui Company as the general management office, and the assets are about 1.2 billion yen.

### Crossing the Plains of Illinois: Visiting President Lincoln's Hometown, Scenes Remain Unchanged, As If Stepping Back a Century

— Special Correspondent in the United States, Mao Shuqing

[Jacksonville Airmail, July 5th] It takes almost a day to drive from Chicago to Springfield. The entire route is a vast prairie, the most affluent agricultural region in the Midwestern United States. Mr. Shen Zuogan, Vice Consul at the Chicago Consulate, was touring overseas Chinese affairs in his own car, and I hitched a ride south with him. The car left the Chicago city area, turned southwest, passed through the beautiful and tranquil small town of "Joliet," and then passed Wilmington, a center of wartime munitions and explosives industry. It is said that the American military once invested a huge amount of capital to build explosives factories on the outskirts of Wilmington. Later, when enough explosives had been manufactured, all the buildings were deliberately demolished. We did not stop in these small towns. The car drove on the flat rural highway, and we could see the fields on both sides and some of the ripening rice and wheat. Although the rural highways in the United States are not as wide as those in Germany, from the perspective of daily traffic, they are already considered top-notch. Our first stop was in Pontiac, a beautiful small city between Chicago and Springfield. Pontiac is home to the Illinois State Penitentiary, a very well-equipped prison. Warden Fushi led us to visit the prisoners' dormitories, workshops, schools, and kitchens. We stayed in the prison for two and a half hours.

Pontiac Penitentiary

Currently, there are 1,200 prisoners. The highest number before the war was 2,100; some were also "transferred for military service" during the war. Currently, the prison has a total of 225 staff members, both civilian and military. It is considered a medium-sized prison among the many prisons in the United States. The prison occupies ten acres of land. Except for not having a very large sports field, everything else is sufficient. The prison management is like a school. There are nine watchtowers around the walls, equipped with machine guns and carbines, and guarded by military police. Apart from this, there are no weapons visible inside the prison itself. The prisoners do not sit in the dormitories; the doors of the dormitories are locked. Some are "single rooms," and some are dormitories shared by two prisoners. Each dormitory has a wire bed, washing facilities, and a flush toilet. The prisoners go to bed at 10 p.m. and spend the day in the classroom, in the workshop, or in the kitchen, or on the exercise field, just like student life. The managers call the prisoners "boys," like teachers towards students. There are many Black people among the "boys," but also half are White. They are mixed together. Some believe in Christianity, a few believe in Catholicism, and five believe in "Judaism." Religious education occupies a very important position in the prison, which is to compensate for the inadequacy of rigid laws. There are many wooden products in the prison workshop, which are the work achievements of the prisoners. The American government has money, and their judicial expenses are unmatched by any other country. The workshop is piled high with wood materials and ironworking machines. In the prisoners' kitchen, there are mountains of canned food. The prisoners line up to enter the dining hall every day. The dining hall has a "Today's Menu" posted. In many places, I felt that it was more refined than their barrack life in Europe and overseas. When Americans commit crimes, probably the only punishment is the loss of freedom, the loss of the right to live with their wives and parents. This is what most American children consider "the ultimate punishment." Apart from this, I could not find their prison life to be more depressing than school life. The relatives of the "boys" can visit them at a set time each week; but only near the gatehouse, and they have no right to go further inside. When we went in to visit, we were searched all over, what people in Shanghai call "being frisked," again and again, before we were allowed to enter. Americans emphasize the concept of responsibility, and this is the responsibility of the gatekeeper. Continuing south from Pontiac, passing through Bloomington, then another twenty-eight miles,

To Lincoln, Illinois

A large monument stands in front of the town: "The only town in the United States named after Lincoln"; but it has nothing to do with Lincoln. Another twenty miles ahead is Springfield, the "capital" of Illinois, President Lincoln's second hometown. There are twenty or thirty towns and cities in the United States called Springfield. The largest "Springfield" is the capital of Illinois. Illinois has a population of over seven million, with Chicago accounting for one-half. Therefore, in the vast countryside, the population is not very large. Springfield is the state capital, with just over 75,000 people. It is a clean and wild small city, with tree-lined streets and towering small houses, giving a sense of beauty. The largest building in the city is the state capitol, in front of which stands a bronze statue of President Lincoln. Every day, no matter what year, what month, Springfield constantly attracts many tourists from all cities, states, and even countries. They come to pay homage to President Lincoln's tomb and to visit the hometown of this great man. Therefore, throughout Springfield, there are specially set up signposts: This is "To Lincoln's Home," that is "To Lincoln's Tomb." In fact, Lincoln's birthplace was not in Springfield at all, nor was it in Illinois at all. Historically, Lincoln was born in Kentucky, in an extremely poor family. At the age of six, he wandered to Indiana, where he spent his difficult childhood. In 1833, at the age of twenty-four, Lincoln moved to Springfield, Illinois, and remained deeply connected with Springfield until his death. He was buried in Springfield after his death. There are three places to see when visiting Lincoln's hometown in Springfield: one is the place where Lincoln lived in poverty as a young man,

New Salem Village

Lincoln lived in that village for six years. Now, all the "historical sites" in the village are maintained by the government and turned into "Illinois State Park New Salem." Americans call it "Lincoln's New Salem," meaning that the village is named after Lincoln. New Salem Village is twenty-six miles from Springfield, in the northwest suburbs of Springfield. Now, because it is a state park, no ordinary people live there anymore. As early as around 1810, before the large-scale westward movement in the United States, a group of enterprising White people moved west from New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, and other places to Illinois, and settled in that village. They lived in small wooden shacks with dirt roads made of rubble. The simplicity of material life was similar to that of rural China today. Lincoln was appointed postmaster of New Salem Village in 1833, so he moved to the village. Lincoln served as postmaster for three years and twenty-one days, resigning in 1836. To this day, there is still a

Memorial Post Office, which is still the same wooden shack from Lincoln's time. Inside, there are various photos and explanations of the village's history. The post office specializes in selling President Lincoln commemorative postcards. Every day, many tourists send letters or postcards to their families or relatives from here. The current postmaster is Mr. John Gillerman, who is working in the same position as Lincoln was one hundred years ago. Gillerman took office on February 12, 1940, and has been serving at the Memorial Post Office for more than six years. He is a witty person who compares himself to Lincoln and is often the subject of news reporter interviews. This small village, still preserving its antique charm, with its fig trees, rubble, dirt roads, small wooden shacks, rainwater pipes, blacksmith's hammer workshop, carpenter's axes and saws, and ox-powered rice husking equipment, is almost identical to the villages in poor and remote areas of China today; except that the style of the houses is different and the materials used are different. China uses mud walls or brick walls, while at that time, America used extremely crude wooden walls. I stayed in that small village for nearly half a day. Twenty-four tour guides specially appointed by the state government led a continuous stream of tourists in and out of the small village. The guides explained in detail the overview and history of the village, as well as the rise and fall of the dozen or so families who lived there year-round. Their houses, decorations, tables, chairs, beds, and utensils are preserved in their original state for tourists to admire. Even the cattle and sheep raised by each family at that time, and the flowers and plants they planted, are preserved in their original state; except that the cattle and sheep have died and been replaced with new ones, and the flowers and plants have withered and been replanted. Which families grew peppers and which families grew tobacco are still clearly distinguished. On the main road in the village, there is a large farm wagon, a wooden-wheeled vehicle with wheels all over, which was the main means of transportation in the era of westward expansion. The park authorities still use two oxen to pull it around for exhibition, indicating that the residents of these villages relied on such tools to pioneer and defeat the Red Indians to come here.

### Minister Receives Business Leaders to Seek Opinions on Saving the Crisis, Believes That the Focus of Future Monetary and Current Policy Should Be on Developing Agriculture and Industry; Business, Industry, and Finance Sectors Have Drafted Countermeasures and Will Send Representatives to the Capital to Petition

[Report from this newspaper] In order to hear about the current difficulties of the business community in the city, Mr. Chen Lifu, Minister of the Central Organization Department, hosted all members of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday afternoon at 5 p.m. at the New Life Club. About fifty people attended, including directors of the Chamber of Commerce and members of the press. Mr. Chen began by delivering a speech, stating that today's tea party was both to congratulate all the newly appointed directors of the Chamber of Commerce and to listen to the insights of the leaders of the business community, so that after summarizing them, he could forward them to the Central Government, and he hoped that everyone present would provide as much input as possible.

Subsequently, Xu Jiguang, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, responded by thanking Minister Chen for hosting the tea party. Mr. Xu then recalled the experience of the Chamber of Commerce during the eight years of the War of Resistance, expressing its willingness to wander. It was not until the beginning of August last year, when the Japanese surrendered, that the Chamber of Commerce was recovered on August 20th, and a reorganization committee was established. He also clarified the Chamber of Commerce's intentions at the time: first, to stabilize people's livelihoods; second, to increase production; third, to attract talent; and fourth, to consolidate finance. The Chamber of Commerce will gradually promote its affairs following these sixteen characters. Mr. Xu then nominated representatives of various industries present and hoped that they would provide information on the current difficulties of each industry, so that Minister Chen could forward them to the Central Government.

### Trust · Insurance

Mr. Wang Xiaobing first represented the trust and insurance industries, stating that the trust industry is now interdependent with the banking industry, which is very different from the initial enthusiasm for branching out. The current stage of the insurance industry, although there are signs of temporary prosperity, is believed to be 70% serving foreign businesses, and only 30% serving the domestic ones, and it is hoped that the northwest corner can be adjusted.

### Paper Industry Costs · Cannot Compete

Jin Run, representing the paper industry, said that there are currently about twenty-four paper manufacturers. Only five or six are of a certain scale. They are not only under pressure from labor disputes, but also affected by the dumping of imported goods, making their situation extremely difficult. Furthermore, the tariff burden on imported goods is not heavy. Taking cigarette paper as an example, the cost per case after arriving in Shanghai is only 300,000 yuan, while the cost of domestic cigarette paper is about 700,000 yuan per case. If it takes two months for capital to circulate to obtain the product, then adding the interest burden for two months, the cost per case exceeds 900,000 yuan, which is three to one compared to the cost of foreign goods. How can they compete? As far as the paper business is concerned, the situation is slightly better than manufacturing, but there are often losses when importing foreign goods. For example, customs has the freedom to assess the value of imported goods, either based on the invoice issued by the foreign country or based on the Shanghai black market price. The standards for collecting taxes are not fixed, which greatly affects profits and losses. This kind of difficulty is probably not unique to the paper industry. It is hoped that the central government will make some improvements to the current foreign exchange and industrial policies. Otherwise, the economic collapse will be unbearable. Mr. Jin also provided several points of advice: (1) Implement a tiered foreign exchange system; (2) The application for an import permit system should have a strict plan; (3) Find ways to assist export trade; (4) Enemy and puppet factories and their equipment should be rented to private industry at low prices; (5) The import of machinery and production tools and industrial raw materials should be promoted; (6) It is hoped that the current import and export tariff rates will be improved; (7) It is heard that the Ministry of Economic Affairs recently has a proposal to implement price controls, but if it is to be implemented, resources must be controlled; (8) The excessive wartime profits tax has not yet been approved for exemption, and it is still requested to be abolished; (9) Stagnant finances and undeveloped real estate transactions are also one of the main reasons, and it is hoped that real estate transactions can be revitalized.

### Private Shipping Industry Requests Compensation

Zheng Yuliang and Yang Guanbei, representing the shipping industry, expressed their regret over the black market for boat tickets. They hoped that the handling of passenger tickets could be transferred to the Shipping Association to prevent abuses. It was also mentioned that the losses of China's shipping industry during the War of Resistance amounted to more than 600,000 tons, of which private shipping accounted for 92% and state-owned shipping accounted for 8%. Of the more than 500,000 tons of private shipping that were sunk, more than 100,000 tons were used to block ports, and more than 200,000 tons were sunk due to transporting troops and being bombed. More than 200,000 tons were sunk by enemy aircraft in the Sichuan River area. Although the private shipping industry has repeatedly requested compensation, there has been no news of compensation. It is hoped that the government can follow the precedents of the United Kingdom and the Netherlands in compensating private ship wartime losses and promptly compensate them. The Bureau of Enemy and Puppet Property under the Guanwai received a batch of enemy-owned motorized junks, which were leased by sixty-one shipping companies four months ago to transport relief supplies. Now, the Bureau of Enemy and Puppet Property suddenly published a notice to sell them by tender, with a price of 300,000 to 400,000 yuan per ton, and the machinery on the ships must be valued separately. It is hoped that the government will pay attention to this.

### Financial and Industrial Sectors Need to Communicate

Wang Yansong, representing the financial sector, believes that the financial and industrial sectors must communicate with each other. Currently, it is found that central laws and regulations often have a sense of mid-section separation. It is hoped that the Central Bank can fulfill its responsibilities as a bank's bank, and that the Central Bank and the Bank of Communications should restore their past role of assisting commercial banks. At the same time, there should be an overall plan for how finance and industry and commerce can be coordinated and utilized, so that many problems can be solved easily. This entire plan should be submitted to the Supreme National Defense Council as soon as possible for approval and implementation.

Wang Jingdong of the paint industry, Lu Yinggeng of the shipping industry, Wu Yun Chu of the chemical industry, and others also presented their opinions. The main points summarized are as follows: (1) Find ways to reward the import of raw materials and machinery and reduce the dumping of finished products; (2) It is hoped that the government can have a reasonable disposal of the equipment and raw materials added by private factories after being occupied by the enemy.

### Economic Policy Needs to Be Changed

Luo Jihua stated that, under the current difficult situation in the business community, the government's policies seem to need to be changed. By change, one means turning what the government is doing that is not like what the national government does into what a family does. The second is to turn wrong policies into right policies. Mr. Luo believes that government authorities are not unaware of the difficulties mentioned by various industries, but the reason for today's mistakes may be due to excessive emphasis on financial deficits. The immediate task is to quickly establish a comprehensive economic policy. Mr. Luo also listed the drawbacks of the disconnect between national banks and commercial banks and discussed the importance of industrial loans. He explained: Recently, he has been holding several symposiums on economic planning with the industrial, commercial, and financial sectors to formulate an opinion paper on "the current economic crisis and its countermeasures." After obtaining concrete opinions, it will be submitted to the Chamber of Commerce for resolution and implementation, and representatives will be sent to the authorities to appeal. The ultimate goal is to return to Shanghai.

### Tea Exports Should Be Rewarded

Finally, Deng Jingwei, representing the tea industry, stated that Chinese tea merchants cannot control domestic tea prices. However, it is hoped that the government should find ways to regulate the foreign price of tea leaves through foreign policy. And, in accordance with the methods of rewarding tea exports in India, Ceylon, and other places, subsidies should be provided for tea exports.

### The Fleet Returns, Receiving Enthusiastic Welcomes Everywhere
Yesterday, Staff Officer Meng informed this reporter that the fleet of eight ships stationed in the United States consisted of over 70 officers and 900 soldiers. They were led by the current Chief of Staff of the Naval Fleet Command, Mr. Wei Jimin, to Miami Port in the United States for training in January of the 34th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1945]. In August of the same year, the United States gifted China eight warships, which were organized into the Chinese Fleet stationed in the United States, with Lin Zun as the fleet commander. On January 20th of this year, all officers and soldiers sailed the ships to Cuba for training, practicing various shipboard techniques. They departed Cuba on April 8th to return to China, passing through Panama, the Mexican archipelago, U.S. naval ports in San Diego and Smethport, Honolulu's Pearl Harbor, Midway Island, and Yokosuka Port. At each location, they received warm welcomes from local authorities.

### Dredger "Jianshe" Officially Received Yesterday
#### Returned by Japan Under MacArthur's Order
#### We Reserve the Right to Claim Compensation
[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Dredging Bureau had commissioned a large dredger from Germany before the war, named "Jianshe" (Construction). In the 30th year of the Republic [1941], it was seized by the Japanese army and taken to Japan. Recently, General MacArthur's headquarters ordered its return. Yesterday afternoon, the Director of the Dredging Bureau, Mr. Ding Guitang, personally led a team to receive it. He also invited representatives from the American side, relevant guests, and many journalists to participate. After the signing ceremony, a cocktail party was held. The dredger "Jianshe," after arriving in Shanghai from Japan on July 6th, was anchored in the Huangpu River, three miles from the Wusong estuary. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, about twenty guests and hosts boarded the Dredging Bureau's special vessel "Lifēi" to receive the ship. Guests included Li Du, the Chief of Customs, and his deputy, Nipo Lu, as well as the head of the Structural Division of the Municipal Government's Public Works Bureau, Zhu Guoxi.

### Ownership Ceremony Held, Japanese Side Reports Damage
The ceremony began with a speech by Director Ding Guitang, who briefly described the past work of the Jianshe and expressed his deep gratitude to the Allied Supreme Command for assisting in its return. Subsequently, the Japanese captain, Naka Ang, who had sailed the ship to China, stood up to report on the process of the Jianshe being transferred for other uses and the extent of the damage to the vessel. He stated two reasons for the damage: (1) the low moral character of the Japanese people and (2) the lack of care for the ship. However, after General MacArthur's headquarters ordered its return in mid-April of this year, repairs were carried out, so the dredging and navigation functions are now largely intact, with only some minor wiring needing repair.

Receipts for the transfer, in five copies, were signed by representatives from all parties, including Mr. Ding Guitang and the Japanese captain Naka Ang. The original and three copies were taken back by Naka Ang to be submitted to General MacArthur's headquarters. After the signing ceremony, a cocktail party was held.

Because the giant vessel still has several areas awaiting repair, the Chinese side reserved the right to claim compensation. The receipt stated: "Today, the Japanese government, through its official representative, formally returns the dredger Jianshe to the Chinese government. Based on the following terms, authorized representatives of both governments sign: (1) The Chinese government reserves the right to make further claims regarding the ship. (2) If other countries make claims regarding the ship, the Chinese government should make corresponding adjustments after sufficient explanation and agree to the final decision among the Allied nations."

After the reception, Masayuki, an engineer from the Dredging Bureau, led the guests in touring the ship and provided detailed explanations. The Jianshe is the largest trailing suction hopper dredger in the Far East, with a displacement of 8,400 tons and a length of 375 feet. It was built in Germany in 1934. After arriving in China, it dredged the "Shentan" shoal in the Yangtze River estuary. In November 1941, it was "leased" by the Japanese Navy and sailed to Changsha for use by the enemy. Subsequently, it suffered repeated bombings by American planes, and the hull, boilers, and dredging equipment were severely damaged, but fortunately, it did not sink. It was only in mid-April that orders were given to repair it and return it to China.

### Shaoxing Opera Penetrates the Public, American Films Dominate the Market
#### Temples Win by Numbers, Outnumbering Churches
[Our Newspaper's Report] The Bureau of Social Affairs has been registering theaters and religious temples in the city. Statistics show that there are 35 cinemas, 4 spoken drama theaters, 8 Pingju opera houses, and 39 local opera houses in the city, with Shaoxing opera being the most developed. In most other public entertainment venues, 99% of the films shown are American films. Fewer than ten Chinese films have been screened since the victory.

Regarding the registration of religious temples in the city, Buddhist temples and Buddhist associations are the most numerous and are mostly managed by Chinese people. Churches belonging to the British and Americans were occupied by the enemy and puppets during the war and are being gradually recovered. There are also many enemy-owned temples, which have been confiscated by the Enemy Property Disposal Bureau for government use.

### Finnish Spy Tried Yesterday
#### Ye Yaoxian's Case Concluded, Awaiting Judgment
[Another Report] Finnish national Hämäläinen, 54 years old, served as the Finnish Consul in Shanghai for many years before resigning to pursue business. He opened the American-owned Meiji Company in Edoa, dealing in gunpowder raw materials and military supplies. During the Spanish Civil War, he supplied military raw materials and other goods. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, he collaborated with German national Niu Kele (also known as the Monk Zhao Kong) and Japanese nationals to form an intelligence organization dedicated to collecting political intelligence on the United Nations. After the victory, he was arrested by our military authorities and transferred to the court. During yesterday's trial, the defendant denied the existence of a spy organization, claiming it was merely a religious gathering. The case was adjourned for further hearing. The cases of suspected traitors Jin Shounan, Li Hanqing, and Dan Jinbiao were also opened for investigation and adjourned for further questioning.

Ye Yaoguang, the former Chief of General Affairs of the puppet special agent headquarters and manager of the puppet Lida Bank, who was also the nephew of the ringleader of the "76th Division," will have his trial concluded by the High Court and sentenced at 9:30 AM on the 25th of this month.

In April of last year, he arrested Jin Xueyu, an underground worker from Qingpu, on Haig Road and detained him in the Military Police headquarters on Avenue Haig. In addition to beating him with bamboo sticks, he used electric shocks to force a confession, causing Jin to suffer severe injuries. After much effort, Jin was released on bail. After the victory, the perpetrator was arrested by the Third Front Army and handed over to the Military Tribunal for handling.

### Puppet Ambassador to Japan Cai Pei Sentenced to Death, Smiles and Nods Upon Entering, Trembles After Hearing Sentence
#### Puppet District Chief Ye Zhensheng Sentenced to Life Imprisonment
(Our Newspaper's Report) Following Liang Hongzhi's death sentence, Cai Pei, who served as the puppet ambassador to Japan and the puppet mayor of Nanjing, was also sentenced to death yesterday by the High Court, deprived of public rights for life, and all his property was confiscated, except for the necessary living expenses for his family. At 9:30 AM yesterday, Presiding Judge Liu Yu, along with Judges Lu Jun and Qiu Huan Ying, and prosecutors from the High Court's Criminal Division, entered Criminal Court No. 1 and ordered the bailiffs to bring in Cai Pei. Upon hearing the death sentence, his face changed instantly, and his hands trembled. Judge Liu explained to him that the sentence was due to the severity of his crimes and that he could appeal for a retrial within ten days of receiving the judgment. Cai requested to meet with his family, and the court ordered that he could meet them in prison at a later date. The court then adjourned, and Cai Pei was escorted back to prison by the bailiffs. His family cried bitterly, stating that they would appeal for a retrial.

### British Ships Still Sail to Various Ports, A Great Shock to Our Shipping Industry
#### Disconcerting, Refuting the Statements of Swire and Jardine Matheson
British companies Swire and Jardine Matheson, under the pretext of transporting UNRRA relief supplies, are transporting large quantities of commercial goods and infringing upon China's shipping rights. People from all walks of life have protested. On March 16th, UNRRA publicly announced that the contract signed on January 16th, 1946, by the UNRRA and the agent of the British Wartime Transport Department, the Far East Navigation Office, would terminate on July 16th. However, the two companies suddenly published a large joint declaration advertisement in the local *Shen Bao* and *Xin Wen Bao* newspapers, making seven points of sophistry.

### Distorting the Facts
Yesterday, this reporter asked the person in charge of the Shanghai Shipping Business Association for their opinion on the declaration. They replied: (1) Chinese shipping industry personnel have consistently maintained a solemn stance, appealing to the government to pay attention. The Swire and Jardine Matheson companies have never been unfairly criticized. The facts speak for themselves, and there is no need to argue. (2) Our attitude toward the protection of our interests and rights should be the same as that of the British people in protecting their national sovereignty. There is no difference. (3) The British government, from a friendly and allied standpoint, has abandoned all special privileges in China, demonstrating a wise policy. Following the British government's policy, changing their past practices, and reforming old habits is the only way for them to maintain their reputation as "enlightened people." (4) Chinese shipping industry personnel strongly support the UNRRA's announcement to terminate the contract with Swire and Jardine Matheson on the 16th of this month, which shows that they have listened to the situation, paid attention to the facts, and protected sovereignty. We are willing to sincerely undertake the subsequent transportation of relief supplies, and we are actively coordinating all UNRRA-owned and private ships to protect our shipping rights. (5) Upon investigating the Ministry of Finance announcement on March 21st of this year in the Jianghai Customs Gazette No. 39, "Telex No. 8, by order of the Executive Yuan, the transportation of goods and passengers between Chinese ports is limited to Chinese ships. However, given the exceptional circumstances previously, foreign merchant ships commissioned by Chinese government agencies may transport goods and passengers between ports for the purpose of postwar relief until March 31st, 1947," the Shanghai Shipping Business Association requested that Executive Yuan President Song cancel the policy when they met with him in person on July 3rd.

### Many Drawbacks
President Song agreed to the cancellation immediately, and although the implementation has not yet been seen due to procedures and official correspondence, the cancellation is only a matter of time. It is undoubtedly true that the original telegram from the Ministry of Finance allowed foreign merchant ships to operate based on special circumstances and stipulated that they must be commissioned by Chinese government agencies and be within the scope of postwar relief. Therefore, after UNRRA publicly announced the termination of the contract with the Far East Navigation Office on the 16th of this month, there is no need for foreign ships to transport relief supplies commissioned by government agencies. Even before this announcement is canceled, these foreign ships cannot use this as an excuse to operate between our coastal ports, loading commercial goods and passengers. The declaration of Swire and Jardine Matheson that they are following Chinese customs regulations cannot be used as a reason to operate. However, according to newspaper reports, Swire's Yuezhou ship sailed to Qingdao on July 18th, the Niuzhuang ship sailed to Tianjin on the 19th, and the Hanyang ship is scheduled to sail to Qingdao and Tianjin again on July 26th. It is unknown on what basis they are operating, which is shocking. We intend to request an explanation from the customs authorities to understand the true meaning of the government's orders.

### Transportation Group Appoints Committee Members
Regarding the organization of a transportation group by the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association to transport relief supplies, Hu Shiyuan (China Merchants), Li Zhenxian (UNRRA), Dong Haozhen, Li Yunliang (Dad, Datong Joint Venture), Cheng Yuqi (Zhongxing), and Lu Shunwei (Sanbei) have been appointed as committee members. A meeting to establish the group and elect a general manager will be held soon. It is also learned that the Limin ship (Yixiang Company), loaded with relief supplies and heading to Fuzhou, is scheduled to complete customs formalities today and set sail tomorrow morning.

### Grain Scandal
#### Officials and Merchants Sing a Different Tune
#### Shifting Blame Upward
#### Person in Charge of the Transportation Department Calls it a Headache
[Our Newspaper's Report] The grain case hearing continued yesterday for Wu Rongsen of the San Tai Rice Company. It is reported that he continued to claim in his testimony that the 11,000 bags of rice were stored under the commission of the authorities and that he was instructed to sell over 4,000 bags after they were released. In recent days, the key criminals such as Wang Daren have also been shifting the blame upward. Therefore, the person in charge of the Military Law Department, upon leaving the courtroom and seeing reporters, repeatedly said, "It's a headache." The questioning is now largely complete. Starting today, the accounts of the remaining fourteen grain merchants will be audited, and summonses will be issued separately if necessary.

### Yuan Meiyun's Appeal
#### Great Disappointment, Execution Exemption Rejected
[Our Newspaper's Report] Film star Yuan Meiyun was detained by the police and sent to the local court for smoking opium. On May 17th, she was sentenced to six months in prison, one year of deprivation of public rights, and ordered to be sent to a hospital for two months to quit her addiction. The judgment was finalized on June 14th. Yuan was transferred to the Shanghai Women's Prison for execution of the sentence. Subsequently, Yuan's family requested a stay of execution. The prosecutor's office commissioned a forensic examination, which found no drug addiction. Still, citing Article 88 of the Criminal Code, they requested the Criminal Division of the Local Court to exempt her from execution. Judge Shen Tianbao ruled, "The appeal is rejected." Therefore, Yuan's prison life cannot be ended for the time being. The reason for rejecting the appeal is that Article 88 of the Criminal Code refers to the execution of confinement measures. However, the judgment in this case did not involve the execution of any confinement measures, so the appeal does not comply with that article. Therefore, the appeal was rejected.

### Typhoon Hits Hong Kong Severely
#### British Ship Smashed Near Shantou
[United Press Hong Kong, 18th] A typhoon hit Hong Kong today, with wind speeds reaching 60 to 68 miles per hour. According to the British Naval Meteorological Station, the typhoon passed no more than 60 miles from Hong Kong. At the Hong Kong wharves, several ships broke their moorings, and many small boats were damaged. It is reported that the British ship Taibaishan, weighing 2,143 tons, ran aground near Youtou, about 150 miles from Hong Kong, on the 16th of this month and has been smashed to pieces by the typhoon. Due to the strong winds, rescue efforts were impossible, and it had to be left to be destroyed.

According to the Shanghai Meteorological Observatory, the typhoon swirling in the South China Sea for several days reached 22.1 degrees north latitude and 116.3 degrees east longitude at 7:00 AM yesterday and continued to move northwest at a speed of about ten miles. Based on its movement, it is estimated that it would make landfall near Haifeng in Guangdong yesterday afternoon. The typhoon is quite strong and its influence is widespread, generally from Hong Kong in the south to near Fuzhou in the north, all of which will experience strong winds. After the storm makes landfall, its intensity will decrease, but southern Hunan and Jiangxi will still feel some impact from the storm.

The Meteorological Observatory also forecasts: Clear and hazy skies over the Yellow Sea, gentle easterly to southerly winds, and very high sea waves. Central China: cloudy, with localized thunderstorms. Moderate northeasterly to southeasterly winds. Shanghai: cloudy, clear, and hot, with a chance of light showers. Gentle easterly winds. The East China Sea: cloudy, with localized rain or fog along the Chinese coast, gentle easterly winds. Moderate to very high sea waves in the southern part. Taiwan Strait: gentle to strong easterly winds and rain, very high sea waves. The southern coast of Guangdong will have cyclones and rainstorms. The high temperature on the 18th was 85.1 degrees, and the low was 77.0 degrees.

### Cadres of All Levels of Party Headquarters
#### Hold Innovation Forum
A forum on the Party and Government Innovation Movement in Shanghai was held yesterday at 2:00 PM at Xinzha Road Primary School, with over 300 responsible persons from various district party headquarters and guest district branches attending. The chairman reported on the purpose of the meeting, and then attendees raised issues related to party work in the city that should be promoted or reformed.

### Develop Public Utilities
#### Train Technical Personnel
#### Public Utilities Bureau to Hold Engineer Training Class
Director Zhao of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, recognizing that the development of public utilities depends on the cultivation of technical talents, has jointly organized an Electrical Engineer Training Class and a Telephone Engineer Training Class with the Shanghai Electric Power Company and the Shanghai Telephone Company, respectively. Students majoring in electrical engineering from domestic and foreign universities or vocational schools will be recruited and assigned to various departments of the respective companies for practical training. The electrical training will last approximately four years, and the telephone training will last approximately three years. In the telephone field, graduates with at least two years of telephone engineering experience will be recruited for Class B training, which will exempt them from classroom instruction, and the practical training period will also be shorter. These two companies are well-organized electrical engineering enterprises in Shanghai, and their comprehensive training has produced many talents over the years. This collaboration with the bureau to train and openly recruit students is a beneficial initiative in Shanghai. Students trained in these classes will receive a subsidy calculated based on a basic salary of 80 yuan, but they must engage in practical work, submit reports regularly, and participate in examinations to assess their progress. Students who do not work hard will be terminated from training at any time. The application deadline for each class is August 1st. The enrollment regulations and application forms can be obtained from the bureau's office, number 106.

### First Sino-British Commercial Lawsuit
#### Local Court Scheduled to Hear This Morning
[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Local Court is scheduled to hear the case of the Zhongyuan Shipping Bureau versus the British-owned Zicci Yanghang this morning at 9:00 AM in the Sixth Civil Court, regarding the failure to perform a contract and the request for compensation for losses. This is the first Sino-British civil lawsuit after the abolition of extraterritoriality. The case involves the plaintiff, Zhongyuan Shipping Bureau, purchasing a ship from the defendant, British-owned Zicci Yanghang, on November 28, 1945. The contract stipulated that the ship would be delivered in Shanghai upon its arrival, and the total price of 75,000 British pounds would be paid in installments. However, on March 8th of this year, Zicci Yanghang suddenly sent a letter to the Zhongyuan Shipping Bureau, insisting on canceling the contract. The Zhongyuan had already paid 52,027 pounds and 5 shillings and 6 pence in total and had no choice but to demand the full amount back. However, due to the defendant's sudden breach of contract, Zhongyuan suffered significant losses and filed a lawsuit with the local court, requesting that the defendant be ordered to pay compensation of 77,479,944 yuan and 13,088 pounds.

### Ningbo Yucai Middle School Uses Puppet Textbooks
#### Zhejiang Education Department Orders Closure
[Report from Yinxian from Dihua News Agency] Yucai Middle School in Yinxian County was founded by the French national Dai Ande. Previously, it was ordered to be closed by the Education Department in accordance with the law because it enrolled students and started classes without following educational regulations. Dai Ande refused to accept the punishment and filed an appeal with the provincial government. After review by the Education Department, the original punishment was upheld. Recently, the Education Department received a report that the school was still using puppet textbooks to implement slavish education. After investigation, it was found that the Chinese textbooks used in the second and third years of junior high school were all so-called national textbooks compiled by the Puppet Ministry of Education Compilation and Review Committee. The fourth book used in the second year of junior high school contained Zhou Ni's "Visiting the New Village of Japan," and the twelfth lesson of the sixth book used in the third year of junior high school was Wang Ni's telegrams. These absurd works known to the world are now used as teaching materials, which is a major stain on the education community. Therefore, the Yinxian County Government was ordered to close the school.

### The Process of Jiaotong University Moving to Shanghai
#### The Last Group Starts Their Journey East on the 16th
[Report from This Newspaper] The relocation of Jiaotong University to Shanghai began in late September last year. At that time, students from the third and fourth grades of the Shipbuilding Department were sent from Chongqing to Shanghai for internships and to assist the authorities in taking over the Jiangnan Shipyard. As a result, students from other departments and grades also found ways to travel to Shanghai and requested that the school authorities relocate as soon as possible. However, due to transportation issues, it was impossible to implement this temporarily, and it was impossible for all faculty and students to relocate to Shanghai at the same time. Therefore, it was decided to handle it in batches. After joint efforts by the school and students, all fourth-grade students were able to travel east on the Hongyuan ship on October 20. Then, the third-grade students traveled east on the Faku ship and towed a warship in November. On February 18 of this year, the second-grade students traveled east on the Yongli ship and towed a wooden boat. However, because there were many second-grade students, it was impossible to set off at the same time. In addition to most of them traveling east on the Yongli ship, the remaining students from the two departments traveled by land by public bus, passing through Guangyuan and arriving in Xi'an, and then transferred to the Longhai, Jinpu, and Jinghu Railways to arrive in Shanghai. The first-grade students traveled in batches by land (same route and same transportation as part of the second-grade students) from March 15 to March 30 and arrived at the school in Shanghai after many transfers. Now, all students have arrived in Shanghai, and there are still some faculty and staff and

Entering the Gateway to Missouri: Fragrant Grass, Sunset, St. Louis
- Our Newspaper's July 1st Air Dispatch - Special Correspondent in the U.S., Mao Shuqing -

The states of Illinois and Missouri are separated by the Mississippi River, the world's largest river, which flows throughout the entire "Midwest" of the United States, laying the agricultural and industrial foundations for the economic prosperity of the gold-dominated kingdom. The eastern bank of the Mississippi River, near Illinois, is a fertile plain with thousands of acres of good farmland. After passing Alton Town and crossing the Mississippi River bridge, one can see undulating hills. The bridge has very clear road signs, telling us that we have already entered the state of Missouri.

Our group left Illinois the day after visiting Lincoln's hometown. The night before, we stayed in a quiet little town, Jacksonville, a "Shangri-La" of 19,000 residents, with a simple market and four major roads leading to the east, south, west, and north. The residents looked at us with surprised eyes, as if they had never seen Chinese people before. The post office in Jacksonville had never received letters sent to China. The postmaster spent a great deal of effort searching before he could tell me how much postage to put on the letter. The small town had banks, theaters, and telegraph and telephone offices. American citizens also stood in extremely long queues, waiting to buy "priceless" "Nylon" stockings.

Many world travelers praise the small towns of the United States and Switzerland for being clean, elegant, with good scenery and air. The residents often smile at travelers with unfamiliar faces. This time, I traveled from the east to the Midwest, and I felt the same way as they did. Moreover, every small town has the same typical appearance. The powerful capitalism of the United States has not only created many large cities like New York and Chicago but has also perfected countless small markets like Jacksonville.

From Jacksonville to St. Louis, the car took two and a half hours. There were traffic police posts on the bridge connecting the two states, but there were no inspections or other procedures. After crossing the river and bypassing a section of hilly area, we arrived in St. Louis.

One of the Seven Largest Cities in America: The City is Cleaner than New York

St. Louis is now the largest city in Missouri and one of the seven largest cities in the United States, with a population of 819,000, equivalent to a quarter of Chicago. St. Louis spans the Mississippi River. The eastern bank belongs to Illinois and is an industrial area. The business district, markets, government, and schools are all on the western bank, belonging to Missouri. The federal government has a specially built building in St. Louis, which is divided into several departments, including a federal court, an immigration administration, and a military agency of the federal government. All matters related to central authority are handled in the federal building. At the entrance of the building, there is a statue of the Goddess of Liberty holding a "scale," representing the spirit of impartial law enforcement.

The municipal administration of St. Louis is commendable. It is cleaner than New York and more orderly than Chicago. Walking west along Washington Avenue from the bank of the Mississippi River, passing through the busiest Ninth Street and Tenth Street to "Forest Park," everything is clean and tidy. Old-fashioned trams seem to be the main means of transportation in St. Louis. Although American sedans fill the streets, after sunset, the young men and women of St. Louis take trams from the city center to "Forest Park" and the "Ha-An-Lan" nightclub. The Ha-An-Lan nightclub attracts hundreds of young people in St. Louis every day. They shout, jump, row boats, shoot guns, and dance inside. Forest Park is the center of St. Louis. The east side of the park is all the bustling downtown area, and the west side is the residential area. In summer, the weather in St. Louis often reaches over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Every evening at sunset, the city's residents flock into the park like a tide. The park has towering trees, green grass, fountains, and pools. Like Chicago, the municipal government has special entertainment facilities in the park. Chicago has music performances, while St. Louis has large-scale "operas." When I was in Europe, I saw an open-air opera in Rome with 20,000 spectators. Seeing an open-air opera in the United States, St. Louis was the first time. There are many seats on the lawn of the park, and the seats are sold for tickets. People standing behind the seats are all in the free class.

More than ten years ago, the American aviator Lindbergh, who was often seen in the newspapers, was from St. Louis. There are buildings in Forest Park to commemorate Lindbergh's achievements. The northwest of the park is the campus of Washington University.

St. Louis has two universities and several independent colleges. Washington University and St. Louis University are both known for their medical departments. Several Chinese students are studying medicine here. Because I was passing by very hurriedly, I did not have time to visit these two universities.

Overseas Chinese in St. Louis: Men and Women Each Account for Over a Hundred

There are about 200 overseas Chinese in St. Louis, half of whom are women. An old overseas Chinese man, Li Yunan, 66 years old, told me that before World War II, there were more than 700 overseas Chinese in St. Louis. As time went on, those who went back gradually went back, and new ones were not seen coming, so the number gradually decreased. He told many stories and anecdotes about the overseas Chinese. He said that the descendants of overseas Chinese in St. Louis are very prosperous. One couple of overseas Chinese had more than a dozen children. They did not marry white people, let alone marry black people.

He said that he had traveled across the ocean to the United States in the 29th year of the Guangxu reign of the former Qing Dynasty. He was first in San Francisco and moved to St. Louis in the first year of the Republic of China. At that time, there were more overseas Chinese in the United States than there are now. Overseas Chinese were originally "meritorious ministers" in the development of the Midwest and West Coast of the United States, but later, the US government's immigration laws restricted the development of overseas Chinese. It was not until this war that they were revised again. The problems of overseas Chinese in the United States are not like those of overseas Chinese in Europe, who only worry about food and clothing. The problems of overseas Chinese in the United States are many legal problems. In the "Shanghai Restaurant" opened by a Chinese family named Zhao in St. Louis, several overseas Chinese and Deputy Consul Shen Zuogan, who came to inspect overseas Chinese affairs, discussed many issues of dual citizenship and American immigration laws.

Zhou Lianzi, the leader of the overseas Chinese in St. Louis, is a capable person with strong self-confidence. He is in his 60s this year, with a head of white hair like Stettinius. He served as the Director-General of the Chinese American Equal Rights Industrial and Commercial Association. The Chinese American Equal Rights Industrial and Commercial Association is the largest organization of overseas Chinese in the United States, and its branches are located in almost all first and second-tier cities in the United States. Therefore, the leader of the Chinese American Equal Rights Industrial and Commercial Association is also a respected figure among overseas Chinese in the United States. At the welcome meeting for overseas Chinese in St. Louis, Zhou served as chairman. Deputy Consul Shen Zuogan gave a speech on the significance of inspecting overseas Chinese affairs and told the overseas Chinese, "The government is concerned about overseas Chinese at all times. Consuls are public servants of overseas Chinese. I hope to establish close contact with overseas Chinese." The overseas Chinese were very moved after hearing this.

Tan Xichang, the Secretary-General of the Kuomintang's Central Branch in the United States, also came along from Chicago. He reported on the current situation at home and abroad and encouraged the overseas Chinese to continue to devote themselves to the motherland with the patriotic courage of the Anti-Japanese War. I originally came to cover the news, but I was also forced to "give a speech." I talked about my experiences in Germany and the current situation of overseas Chinese in Europe. More than 30 overseas Chinese attended the meeting that day, including an old Chinese lady.

After the meeting, overseas Chinese leader Zhou Lianzi talked about many "historical materials of the overseas Chinese community." He said that Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the Republic of China, came to St. Louis to promote the revolution and took a "nap" in the place where we were meeting. He said that at that time, the overseas Chinese community was very convinced of Sun Yat-sen. At that time, Liang Qichao's pro-imperial "constitutional" party also had people active overseas, but they could not withstand Sun Yat-sen's head-on blow, and "even the signboard was torn down!"

Overseas Chinese in Europe speak the dialects of Danzhou or Qingtian in Zhejiang. Overseas Chinese in the United States usually speak Cantonese, and it is the "Siyi" dialect of Guangdong. During our visit to the overseas Chinese this time, Brother Tan Xichang and Brother Wang Wenjue, the chief writer of the Sanmin Morning Post in Chicago, could also speak Cantonese. According to the overseas Chinese themselves, they are enthusiastically learning Mandarin.

Youths Enlist in the Sicily Campaign, All Return Home Safely

St. Louis does not have Chinese newspapers. They subscribe to Chinese newspapers from major ports (San Francisco) in Chicago and New York and mail them to St. Louis. Several overseas Chinese are very interested in current affairs. They often ask, "Can a third world war be avoided?" A young overseas Chinese man named Zhong told me, "During World War II, more than 20 young overseas Chinese in St. Louis served in the military and went on an expedition to Sicily in the Mediterranean. "The Axis powers were defeated, and all of them returned home safely!"

Li Yunan, the 66-year-old overseas Chinese man, is one who reads the newspaper every day. He said that he had been to Shanghai 40 years ago and read Shen Bao every day. He is very concerned about the current situation of Shen Bao. He has been abroad for 43 years and has returned to China three times. Recently, he decided to return to China and never come back again, "Let the next generation work hard in this new continent." He has two sons, the eldest son is in Chicago, and the second son is in Guangdong. I told him that I hope that after he returns to China, when he goes to Shanghai, he may wish to visit Shen Bao. He said that he will definitely still be one of the readers of Shen Bao.

St. Louis has several English newspapers. The two largest are the "St. Louis Post-Dispatch" and the "Globe-Democrat." Although they rarely have color photos, I think the layout of these two newspapers is better than that of Chicago. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch has four pages every day called "Daily Magazine," and the Globe-Democrat has four pages covering current affairs, theater reviews, features, and behind-the-news stories. They are all powerful vanguards in the magazine-ization of newspapers. On Sundays, they also publish weekly magazines, photos, and colorful cartoons. Among the weekly magazines, there is a review of major events of the week.

The day I arrived in St. Louis was the day when the US Price Control Bureau "died." The Post-Dispatch and the Globe-Democrat both published it as the top headline. Immediately afterward, there were local reactions to the abolition of the Price Control Bureau, the expressions of the municipal government, market fluctuations, and the views of the authorities and related people on the future, all arranged in an orderly manner. The Globe-Democrat's headline for the news of Representative Guo Taiqi's speech in New York was: "Sino-American Cooperation Advocates Revising Veto Power." I think this headline is very appropriate.

The Next Generation is Always Stronger than the Previous Generation: Tall Buildings Stand Everywhere

Arriving in St. Louis, I took my first step into the state of Missouri. The University of Missouri is not in St. Louis, but in the small town of Columbia, 80 miles away. I don't know if these two newspapers are related to journalism education in Missouri. This question will be answered in the future.

In terms of the division between the north and south of the United States, Missouri is considered to be in the central region. Before Roosevelt, in every presidential election in the United States, the Republican Party had an advantage in the north, and the Democratic Party had an advantage in the south. Therefore, some people believe that the number of votes in Missouri can "play a decisive role" in the outcome of the presidential election. In terms of climate and geographical environment, Missouri has the symbolism of "industrial advancement" in the north and the flavor of the current agricultural society in the south. In St. Louis, blacks account for about 40% of the population of 810,000. Many of the people who come and go on the streets and work in restaurants and hotels are blacks.

Before the war, there were very few Japanese. After the war, because of the US decentralization policy, many Japanese ran to St. Louis. Some Japanese work, and some open small toy stores.

Since the end of the war, many veterans have returned to St. Louis. At the same time, "recruiting" slogans are visible everywhere. Newly enlisted volunteer soldiers, wandering on the streets of St. Louis, in groups of three or five, wearing brand-new yellow military uniforms, are innocent and carefree. It is said that the "housing shortage problem" for veterans is also very serious in St. Louis. The Globe-Democrat published an editorial urging veterans to build their own homes, saying, "In the past, our ancestors moved to the west empty-handed, defeated the Red Indians, and never thought of having ready-made houses to live in. They cut wood and built houses themselves, and they developed Missouri. Why is our generation inferior to our ancestors? ... Get up, young guys, don't worry about the housing shortage anymore, let's build our own houses!"

The next generation is stronger than the ancestors after all, don't you believe it? Twenty or thirty-story buildings stand everywhere in St. Louis. The Lens Hotel, the Standtler Hotel, and the courthouse, like Chicago, stand majestically on the Missouri plains. Unfortunately, my stay was too short, and I did not visit the Jefferson Memorial and the Shrine of the Unknown Soldier, as well as the most famous St. Louis Zoo.

But, in any case, St. Louis is beautiful in my impression. In the evening, sitting in the car of an overseas Chinese man named "Xiao Zhong," touring along the banks of the Mississippi River, driving in Forest Park, I looked at the chimneys on the opposite bank of the river, at the rolling waters of the Mississippi, at the sunset and fragrant grass in the park, thinking of President Truman, who always has a smile on his face. I will never forget, I will never forget, these compatriots of the president, the people of Missouri, who always have a smile on their faces.

A Good County Magistrate Hard to Find in Ten Years!

In the Shen Bao of the 22nd of this month, there was an advertisement of an emergency statement by Mr. Wang Zifang of Haimen, denying an anonymous accusation against the current County Magistrate Liu of Haimen, which I found very strange. Of course, I do not know the content of their accusation, but as far as I know, if even a county magistrate who can truly work for the people is accused, then there is really no right and wrong in society, and humanity has no justice at all!

I am an old resident of a long-suffering occupied area. Although I had worked as a civil servant for a while before the war, I suffered all the hardships of the world during the eight years of life under the iron heel in Haimen. I prayed morning and evening for victory, like hoping for light in a long night.

The great victory finally came. We heard triumphant songs from all over, and a heat of enthusiasm rekindled in our hearts. But it was very disappointing. We did not see the national army for half a year. After the restoration, the first county magistrate was Mr. Pan. At that time, the public security was still in the hands of the enemy, so that they could only guard three strongholds, namely the county seat (Mao Town), the San Chang, and Qinglong Port. The entire periphery became a world of terror. Every day, there were unbearable news about someone being massacred, someone being buried alive, someone's house being sealed, and someone's land being confiscated. The people's worried hearts were covered layer by layer with dark gray dust. The taste of victory in the first few months was unexpectedly spent like this.

It was not until the beginning of this year that a young county magistrate, Mr. Liu Daoping, was replaced. He is indeed a local official who works hard. He has a firm and calm personality and a brave and unyielding spirit. The national army arrived with him one after another. He quickly and boldly reorganized the local troops thoroughly in three to five days and deployed a new and expanding military situation. Two weeks later, we found that the drill ground, which was covered with weeds, had been leveled. Every day at dawn, bugles played and the national flag was raised, and the sound of footsteps moved people's sleep. At first, we only thought that this was at most a military exercise, but later we found that many of the people in the ranks were officials from the county government and its subordinate agencies. Taking a closer look, the one running at the end was the new county magistrate. In the eyes of a group of Haimen people who were used to seeing the puppet government, this could not but be considered strange. Later, after inquiring, we learned that the county magistrate implemented military management in all county-level agencies. We still remember one thing. It seemed to be the first day of the Chinese New Year. Early in the morning, we saw a group of teams with clothes soaked to the skin returning to the city from the countryside. The county magistrate was also found in the middle, with rain on his body and mud on his feet. We were very puzzled at the time. Later, at the memorial week, we heard County Magistrate Liu report, roughly saying: "Not long after I took office, the bandits threatened to spend the Chinese New Year in Mao Town. The general public could not help but be alarmed. In order to preemptively take action, I went to Erjia Town for sightseeing and brought back two guests to spend the Chinese New Year in Mao Town." That afternoon, there was new news that the bandits in Erjia Town had all run away, two banks that issued anti-currency had been destroyed, and two instructors had been arrested. It turned out that they were the two guests who had just been seen on stage to spend the Chinese New Year in Mao Town. This made the people very excited. Erjia Town is under the jurisdiction of Nantong and is adjacent to the border of Haimen. A county magistrate who has been in office for less than ten days personally led the team to set off on a night with heavy rain, which is at least an innovation in Haimen.

Time passed quickly, and the situation changed even faster. The scope of the three small points expanded to dozens of miles. The port was opened, Shanghai ships arrived, the highway was restored, and cars traveled back and forth continuously. The county gradually prospered. At first, I did not understand how this situation was created. It took me a month or two to understand that it was entirely due to the effect of County Magistrate Liu leading hundreds of security teams to operate day and night in the periphery. Isn't it impossible to achieve peace with fighting?" I don't believe it. As long as there is a good government, it is easy to fight bandits.

Every memorial week, we heard about the major events in the county, and the people collectively participated. The memorial week was also started by him. At first, everyone was a little reluctant, but later they all became interested in listening. At the memorial week, I saw judicial police who exploited people, prison guards who extorted money, and illegal military police being punished in public. It is said that a deputy township chief who was addicted to drugs was shot on the spot once. But on the other hand, anyone could see old women on the road complaining to him, and they would always go back satisfied. This style made the people feel both afraid and inexplicably loved in their hearts.

It seems that this county magistrate does not know how to socialize. He publicly rejected local people's banquets. The staff of the county government were not allowed to go out except on Sundays, and they were even forbidden to socialize with local people, as if to avoid local people talking about favor. But if you offend people for this matter, there is a price to pay. This is what the staff of the county government told me personally.

We Haimen people have a good habit, which is to get up very early. Because we get up early, we can see this county magistrate operating like this every day. At least several times a week, he is found in the countryside. What I can never forget is his contribution during the time when the communist army threatened the county seat with a large number of troops several times. His calm spirit that can hold on made everyone speechless. Two or three hundred people guarded the city and also controlled the area. Twice, when it was most critical, 70% or 80% of the people in the city fled during the day, but he seemed as if nothing had happened and was playing basketball. The people thought that nothing had happened and all ran back. Although nothing happened, we later learned that he had led soldiers crawling in the wheat fields on the outskirts of the city for five or six nights to protect the urban area.

That's all I know. If you say that such a county magistrate is not good and you want to sue him, I don't know what crimes the person who sues him is suing him for. If he is caught in the communist army's division and instigation, it will really turn right and wrong upside down. Not to mention a hundred years, it is hard to find in at least ten years. Where can we find a good county magistrate who really loves us? My cry of injustice can always represent the voice of the majority of the people in Haimen. (Zhang Keming from Mao Town)

Save the 100,000 Salt Workers

I am a salt worker from Yuyao, with more than 100,000 people. Except for a few who are engaged in navigation and fishing, the rest rely on drying salt to make a living. Regardless of men, women, old or young, they work hard, and the daily working hours are as long as 14 hours. Their spirit of enduring hardship is admirable. However, what they earn is not only not enough to eat their fill, but they cannot even eat red grains and corn. They often fill their stomachs with bran and chaff. Their sadness and suffering are indescribable.

Since the fall four years ago, they have been repeatedly plundered by the enemy and puppets. However, the salt workers' spirit of patriotism and adventure is admirable. They often go in and out of the forbidden areas of the enemy and puppets and the defense areas of the bandits, robbing and transporting salt to various counties in Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Hubei provinces. The fact that the salt supply in dozens of counties has not been depleted is due to their efforts to rob and transport salt at the risk of life and death. Therefore, their income was abundant at that time, and they could barely make ends meet.

However, at the beginning of the victory, they were suddenly robbed by treacherous bandits. All the stored salt was robbed. Once the national army arrived, it had become "anti-currency" that could not be cashed. This was an unprecedented robbery. Even now, thinking about it, there are still regrets. This is a fatal wound to the salt workers!

The soaring price of steel and the imbalance of the salt price have made it impossible to make a living. However, the salt workers are naturally strong. If this continues, how can the public security in Yuyao be lost? For this reason, I appeal to the government authorities to quickly provide a fundamental solution, appropriately increase the salt price, and ask the relief general office to quickly make a temporary solution, raise food, and provide emergency relief to ensure that they do not freeze or starve. Only by treating both the symptoms and the root cause can this be a blessing for the salt workers and a celebration for the future of public security in Yuyao. (Huang Chu)

Communist Army Mixed into Northern Jiangsu - You Fu

Let the Glory of Peace Comfort People's Hearts

The people of Northern Jiangsu have endured hardship and pain for eight years under the trampling of the enemy. During these eight years, they lived like cattle and horses, struggling to survive. Their only hope was to let the glory of peace comfort the hearts of the people of Northern Jiangsu and restore the past life of peace and contentment. And today, what victory has given them is: refugees everywhere, millions of people homeless, wandering in the north and south of the Yangtze River. This tragic situation is the "favor" given by the communists who sing high-sounding "people's livelihood" and "liberation". They have turned the land of Northern Jiangsu into a devastated world! If our minds are not forgetful, we will surely clearly recall the tragic scene in the autumn of the 29th year. Unexpectedly, that tragic scene has become an eternal tragedy.

At that time, Northern Jiangsu was under the control of Chairman Han and General Commander Li's guerrilla troops, protecting Greater Northern Jiangsu and fighting the enemy extensively and head-on. Unexpectedly, the communist party took advantage of the banner of resisting Japan and mixed into Northern Jiangsu. In the name of the Fourth Route Army's vanguard column, led by Guan Wenwei, before entering, Chen Yi, the current commander of the Fourth Route Army (at that time, the commander of the First Detachment), went to Taizhou to discuss cooperation with General Commander Li and fight against Japan together. In fact, at that time, the communist party had ulterior motives, because their strength was limited and they had to use political tactics to lay the foundation for their so-called military. General Li Mingyang, who was known as a good man of the people of Northern Jiangsu, thought that it would be fine to have another anti-Japanese force to cooperate. Therefore, the communist party seized the opportunity and gradually entered this land, launching political and special affairs work. On the surface, in propaganda, everything was to deal with the common enemy Japan, but in fact, it was only to expand its own strength.

The Communist Army Was Overjoyed and Flanked the National Army from the Rear

Later, the Fourth Route Army in Southern Jiangsu had no place to stand, crossed the Yangtze River and moved to Northern Jiangsu. It is estimated that the communist army had 30,000 troops. Just when the enemy was attacking Liangtai (Taizhou and Taixing), General Commander Li's troops were busy fighting the enemy with blood and overjoyed. The communist party turned ruthless and took advantage of the national army's exhaustion to flank the national army from the rear. The national army was attacked from both sides and suffered greatly. At the same time, countless lives were sacrificed under the communist army's artillery fire. This is the most heartbreaking thing.

Later, while still breathing unevenly, the New Fourth Army adopted a strategy of defeating each unit separately, dividing and attacking the various troops in Northern Jiangsu, skillfully using political propaganda and despicable special affairs activities. From the autumn of the 29th year to the autumn of the following year, the Northern Jiangsu Security Brigade, the Standing Brigade, the Tax Police Corps, the Eighty-ninth Army, the Lu-Su-Wan Headquarters, and other scattered troops, the entire main force was eliminated. From then on, Northern Jiangsu became a "liberated area".

Controlled the Northern Jiangsu Area, Three Stages of Activity

After the communist party controlled Northern Jiangsu, their activities can be divided into three stages, which are briefly described below:

The first stage, their policy, was to use "resisting Japan" as the name and "liberating" the people from suffering as the slogan. Buy people's hearts and seize the people. The ignorant workers and peasants contributed their efforts, nothing more than wanting to be "liberated". The bourgeois gentry desperately paid money, trying to maintain their property and status, and hoping to participate in the government organization so that they could become officials in the future. The communist party went along with the tide, invisibly "grasped" the proletariat and exploited the bourgeoisie.

The second stage was to call on workers and peasants to overthrow capitalists and eliminate local tyrants and evil gentry. Regardless of large or small capital, the amount of land, as long as they had a little land, they were listed as "capitalists" and became the object of struggle for workers and peasants. On the other hand, they set up various names to organize peasant resistance associations, women's resistance associations, workers' resistance associations, business resistance associations, children's resistance associations, militia self-defense teams, shock teams, guerrilla teams... etc., and arbitrarily appointed committee members, directors, chairmen, group leaders, cadres, team leaders... etc.

The third stage, which is the current stage of struggle and joining the army, the so-called three-capital struggle, namely "capital", "reputation" and "experience", is also the case. Anyone with capital, reputation, or experience (service experience) is listed as the target of struggle. Regarding joining the army, all men aged 16 to 45 must participate in the army to fight internal battles for them, be used by them, and sacrifice in vain. The women who join the army are mostly young women and middle-aged women, equivalent to comfort women of prostitute nature. The daughters of good families, married women, win the joy of soldiers with their bodies and souls.

A Bloody World, Leaving Only Painful Groans

Now, people can no longer stand the communist party's deception and oppression, and they have fled one after another, abandoning their homes, wives and children separated, running around, suffering from hunger and cold. Indeed, this is the current crisis in Northern Jiangsu. Northern Jiangsu! Poor Northern Jiangsu! It has been brutally defiled by inhumane robbers, and what remains is the painful groan of the dying.

Medicine and Health

(1) Mao Yutian Asked: My mother is already sixty years old. Because of poverty and malnutrition, she often has worries, so her body is weak. Last year, around December, she suffered from illness. At first, I thought it was because of the cold weather and weakness, but after recuperating (without seeing a doctor or taking medicine), she gradually recovered, and her diet was normal. However, in terms of movement, she seemed to be less flexible and spoke incoherently. Twenty days ago, she was sitting alone in the sun when she suddenly fainted and fell to the ground unable to get up. Her speech was slurred. After being helped up, it was found that her mouth and eyes were crooked, and her left limbs (arms, legs, and feet) were paralyzed and unable to move. May I ask what disease this is? What symptomatic injections can be used for treatment? Is there any hope of recovery?

[Reply from Dr. Yu Xin'en]: The disease is a stroke, which is caused by the rupture of a blood vessel in the brain and the blood clot pressing on the brain nerves, resulting in hemiplegia. There is no specific medicine. After the blood clot is absorbed and digested, it may be cured.

### Responding to the Patriotic Movement to Promote National Products Mobile Exhibition

The Shanghai Municipal Federation of National Product Factories, based on living experience, held its third joint meeting of directors and supervisors at the Caohuiing Guanshengyuan Farm a few days ago. Chairman Lu Xingzhuang, after hearing Hu Boxiang's report, clarified the significance of the patriotic movement to promote national products. Finally, a resolution was passed to respond to the patriotic movement and continue to hold mobile exhibitions of national products. The detailed methods will be drafted by the administrative department and then actively prepared. According to the person in charge of the federation, the preparation period for this mobile exhibition of national products is about two months. Therefore, the official mobile exhibition will be held in October. It is reported that the Federation of National Product Factories has held many mobile exhibitions of national products before the war, covering a considerable area, so that the public can have a deep understanding of national products and dare to emulate them to the greatest extent.

### Minister Chen's Response: Financial Policies Must Align with People's Livelihood

After listening to various opinions, Minister Chen gave a reply, stating briefly: Due to time constraints, it is not possible for all industries to speak their minds freely today. Mr. Chen believes that it is remarkable and rare that our weak country was able to support the eight-year War of Resistance and ultimately achieve victory. Therefore, after the victory, various difficult problems may arise, and he sincerely hopes that all parties can solve them with an open mind. In my opinion, the disease of the industrial and commercial sector today is due to the accumulation of problems over time that have erupted all at once. The main problem is actually caused by erroneous financial policies. As Mr. Jiang Baili said: "If the national defense policy is in line with the people's livelihood policy, then the country will be strong; if they are separated, the country will be weak; and if they are opposed, the country will perish." I would like to paraphrase it as: "If the financial policy is in line with the people's livelihood policy, then the country will be rich; if they are separated, the country will be poor; and if they are contrary, the country will perish." Our country is based on agriculture, so the way to build the country today should be to study how to industrialize agriculture. Financial policies should not focus solely on commerce, while neglecting the agricultural and industrial sectors that are related to the interests of the masses. If the foundation of agriculture and industry is not consolidated, commerce will also be unable to prosper. In terms of economic policies, fiscal and financial matters should be separated. In terms of fiscal policy, we should focus on ways to increase revenue and reduce expenditure, while in terms of financial policy, we should try to promote the development of agriculture and industry, so that the funds of the two industries can circulate and the welfare of the majority of people can be taken care of. All kinds of diseases can be solved, and the positions of the government and the people are originally consistent. Today, I am honored to receive opinions from everyone, and I am willing to convey them to the highest authorities of the central government.

After Minister Chen finished his speech, everyone dispersed in an atmosphere of harmony, at 8:30 pm. Four representatives from the US military, including Smith, and the receiving personnel included Ding Guitang, Director of the Binpu Bureau, Yuan Jin, Shi Konghuai, Chief Engineer Xue Zhuobin, and dredging engineer Maas. At 4:50 pm, the special vessel arrived at the No. 1 berth in Yuansha Toutiao River. The national flag was immediately raised on the giant dredging vessel, and the whistle was sounded to welcome the receiving personnel. After boarding the vessel, the Japanese ship owner, Nakajima, led them to the conference room, where the signing ceremony was held by both parties.

### Defying the Oceans and Breaking Through Ten Thousand Miles of Waves, Our Fleet Returns from Overseas, Arriving at the Mouth of the Song River This Morning, Proceeding Directly to Nanjing for Inspection, and Then Returning to Shanghai for Garrison

[Our Newspaper] The eight new ships donated by the United States to our country were originally scheduled to arrive at the mouth of the Wusong River at 8:00 pm yesterday, but according to the information, the arrival time of the ships is about 3:00 am this morning. Some of the naval personnel stationed in Shanghai went to the mouth of the Wusong River yesterday afternoon with supplies to welcome them. It is also learned that the new ships are preparing to stay in Shanghai for more than ten hours and then sail to Nanjing, arriving in the capital around the 22nd of this month. At that time, an inspection will be held in Beijing. After the inspection of the new ships in the capital, it is expected that they will return to Shanghai around the 25th of this month and enter the Huangpu River. The Shanghai Office of the Naval Headquarters and the Party, government, and military agencies will jointly hold a welcome ceremony for the new ships at that time. One of the programs may be to invite people from all walks of life to visit.

Another piece of information: the sailors on the new ships are all trained in the United States. In the future, the naval authorities may set up short-term officer training courses to train them and promote them to officers. On the other hand, the second battalion of the first training camp of the navy, which is currently training on Fuxing Island, will be sent to the ships as sailors. However, it will still take two months of training on the ships for them to be promoted to formal sailors.

### An American Friend Talks About China: "If You Want Your Country to be Strong, Start with Schools!"

— Wang Wenyi

(Note by the author: Mr. Leeper, representative of the Education Survey Group of the China Branch of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, has successively inspected education in China in Kunming, Chongqing, Shanghai, and other places. A few days ago, he was invited by Qingxin Middle School in this city to give a speech at the 86th graduation ceremony of the school. The speech was meaningful, and I have translated its meaning here.)

"I am somewhat pessimistic, feeling that our civilization is in a dangerous transitional period, with clouds and storms ahead. We know that the atomic bomb is already the ultimate weapon in a hateful war. But I believe that in the near future, there will be weapons more powerful than the atomic bomb that can destroy world civilization.

"China is the most peace-loving country, has endured the longest in this war, and has made the greatest sacrifices. It urgently needs foreign relief, and I believe that the United States will do its best to help its allies who fought alongside it. The current government of China is very suitable for the Chinese people, and I believe that no government can last long without international assistance.

"Schools are the starting point of knowledge. The Iron Chancellor of Germany, Bismarck, once said: 'If you want your country to be strong, start with schools.' In the United States, schools are the first line of defense—the defense of democracy—now, I have seen the first line of defense in China—the defense of promoting democracy.

"From today onwards, I have successively inspected schools in Chongqing, Kunming, Beiping, Shanghai, and other places. I know that many promising male and female students are struggling in the face of obstacles under the leadership of their wise leaders. My heart is very concerned about them, so I feel very willing to do something beneficial to them. At the same time, we can bravely look forward to the era gradually becoming brighter. As the saying goes: 'Life is like a rose, how can it stand out without twists and turns?' I hope that the life of the new China after eight years of long-term resistance against aggression can stand out in the world."

"Someone asked me: 'What is your impression of China?' I am willing to answer this question. I have made a small comparison between China and the United States, but this is not a perfect conclusion, and I dare not be dogmatic. I hope someone will correct my mistakes."

### Two Comparisons Between China and America

1.  The Chinese are too weak in solidarity, and most of them do not care about the interests of their compatriots. This is a major defect of China and the most different point from the United States.

2.  I feel that the Chinese have a very clear cultural awareness, but they are not enthusiastic about patriotism. This imperfection should be improved.

3.  China likes to recall its past achievements too much, but the United States does not. They are studying "What is this?" and "Why is this?"

4.  China is an agricultural country, with an agricultural foundation, but the United States and most Western countries are based on religion and commerce.

5.  Chinese culture is immortal, and it can never be deprived by the United States or communists. At the same time, if China wants to be suitable for survival, it is very important to increase the training of the next generation.

I am just a small representative from the United States to China, and I sincerely hope that China can get on the right track, accept and fulfill its responsibilities, and truly become one of the world's five great powers.

### Jeeps in Nanjing Are Prohibited from Carrying Female Companions

— Lu

After the official establishment of the Ministry of National Defense, Chief of Staff Chen Cheng issued an order prohibiting jeeps from carrying "Jeep Girls"!

Recently, jeeps have caused a lot of trouble. It is very common to see news of two or three people being killed by jeeps every day in the newspapers. Sometimes, jeeps drive into shops and knock over counters. Sometimes, two jeeps kiss each other...

Could it be that women are indeed "troublemakers"? Because of Jeep Girls, more gasoline is consumed; because of Jeep Girls, more innocent ghosts are crushed under the wheels; because of Jeep Girls, roads and cars are used for fewer years? Because women's hearts are dynamic—dancing, watching plays, taking rides, eating—constantly playing tricks, and thus, jeeps are constantly running back and forth day and night!

Speaking of Jeep Girls, the origin is extremely comical. Initially in Kunming, because the US military first brought jeeps to Kunming, due to language barriers, in addition to male interpreters, there were naturally female interpreters. Later, the work of female interpreters became very necessary. As a result, some women who loved vanity and enjoyment, some socially corrupt socialites, and some female students who could speak a few sentences of English all became Jeep Girls.

Later, this trend spread to Chongqing. The number of Jeep Girls in Chongqing also increased with the arrival of the US military. Later, Chengdu, Xi'an, and other major cities all had this phenomenon. When there were just Jeep Girls in Chongqing, it aroused the curiosity of the ignorant masses, and large groups of people surrounded the jeeps, even laughing out loud. Later, the Garrison Headquarters, fearing that misunderstandings might arise due to language barriers between the Allied forces and the people, issued a strict notice prohibiting people from clapping their hands and laughing, or even surrounding jeeps for no reason, on pain of being accused of disrupting public order... After this notice was posted, everyone looked at Jeep Girls with new eyes.

Following the return to the capital after victory, these Jeep Girls reappeared in Nanjing and Shanghai. In fact, to be honest, there are very few real Jeep Girls on the jeeps now. Some are family members of military agencies, some are friends of friends, some are even the driver's XX, it's really...

For the sake of saving gasoline, reducing vehicle wear and tear, maintaining social order, and rectifying military discipline, Chief Chen's measure is wise. However, it is hard to say about things in China. Some are half-hearted, and some are not thorough.

As for where Jeep Girls will go? Please don't worry about them, they will come from where they came from and go where they are going! Before jeeps came to China, they could go out just the same. Therefore, after jeeps are prohibited from carrying female companions, rickshaws, buses, trams, and even walking can be used. They are holding on to 120,000 points of hope and enthusiasm, waiting for the facts to prove the effectiveness of this order!

### A Record of an Old Instructor

— You Xiao

Colonel Lin graduated from the Baoding Military Academy and devoted himself to the military early in life. For thirty-two years, he never achieved the rank of general.

He was a colonel ten years ago, and he's still a colonel now, which is truly perplexing.

In terms of fighting battles, he has participated in hundreds of large and small campaigns, been wounded, and shed blood. He has never deserted or abandoned his post. In terms of handling affairs, he is serious and meticulous. Even the smallest matter is never taken lightly. In the end, he is still just a colonel. One day, when he was feeling troubled, a friend came to visit. The friend advised him, "We should aspire to do great things, not to become high officials. Do you agree?"

He said, "What you say makes a lot of sense. In today's society, in today's country, in today's environment, and for me today, using these words as comfort is the best policy."

After listening, the friend offered his absurd grand theory: "During the war, everything is difficult, prices are high, and personal integrity is diminished. Hard work and perseverance lead to dismissal and investigation; indifference and carelessness lead to commendation."

He said, "You're simply talking nonsense. Only I know my own experiences, and only I understand my own weaknesses. Today's society emphasizes how to conduct oneself and handle affairs. I only regret that I read too many mechanical military books in my youth and didn't receive education on how to be a person and handle affairs. Now, I don't understand people's livelihoods, I don't know how to be a person, I only know how to be dutiful and obey orders. This is what I've learned from my ten years as a colonel, and it's my greatest regret." The friend said, "Regrets can be remedied. You should quickly buy two books, 'The Art of Handling Affairs' and 'The Philosophy of Being a Person,' to read. Or you might as well ask those officials who get promoted and make a fortune for advice. I guarantee you'll be promoted to major general immediately."

He said, "Colonel or major general, less idle talk, everything must be realistic. Tomorrow, my family of five won't have rice for two meals. Could you lend me a hand to help with this urgent need?"

The friend said, "We're in the same boat. Forgive me for not being able to comply. My own stomach is sending out emergency signals. Farewell, farewell."

After the friend left, he remained sullen and frowning, thinking about the next day's living expenses. Suddenly, a orderly came and handed him a letter. The orderly left. He opened it and saw that it was an order from his superiors transferring him to a military education institution in Chengdu as the chief instructor of tactics. But he would still be a colonel. He was furious. However, when he saw below that he was ordered to depart from Guiyang the day after tomorrow, with a daily per diem of four hundred yuan, and other miscellaneous allowances for dependents, he jumped up with joy.

He thought, "Tomorrow I won't have money to buy rice, but today someone is sending money! Good! I'll go to the office to collect the money immediately." He ran to the accounting office, but it was already closed. Later, he was lucky enough to run into the head of the accounting office, who was also an old colleague of many years and helped him a lot. He received the money and repeatedly thanked him.

Half a month later, under extremely difficult transportation conditions, he caught a ride on a military vehicle and arrived in Chengdu smoothly. He didn't pay a penny for the ride, only spending money on hotel and meals, but the money left in his pocket was already very little. He couldn't help thinking that he was lucky to have taken a free ride, otherwise, he would have been stranded on the way. Thinking of this, he silently thanked the driver for giving him such great kindness.

When he arrived in Chengdu, he lived in public housing and ate the public's subsidized rice. At the same time, prices in Chengdu were slightly lower than in Guiyang, so life was barely happy.

As time went on, prices rose, and rice became more expensive, but his salary remained the same. Of course, life was not as good as before.

A family of five, a couple and three young children. Apart from his wife receiving an adult dependent's rice ration, the three children were all under twelve years old and could only receive half a person's rice ration. However, although the children received less rice, they ate more than the adults. Who knew this kind of suffering? So, he lingered on, living each day like a year: "Let's be full today and not worry about being hungry tomorrow!" Poor! Poor! Poor! Always poor! Rice! Rice! Rice! Always short of rice!

One day, when he was giving a "tactics" lesson to the students, the orderly came in to report: "Reporting, Instructor, there's no rice at home today. Please return and find a solution!" He was very angry when he heard this. It made him lose face in front of the students. But then he thought that since things were like this, he might as well be frank. He said to the students: "Classmates, it's not that the instructor is being negligent. It's just that the 'livelihood' problem cannot be solved, so I have to dismiss the class first. If the Dean of Education asks where the instructor has gone, please report the truth and let him punish me as he sees fit." After returning home, his wife told him that she had borrowed rice from several places, but still had nothing. He sat there in a daze, his mind constantly thinking. "The orderly already knows that I have no rice to eat. My face is gone. I might as well toughen up and ask him to think of a way." He made up his mind and asked the orderly to borrow rice. Fortunately, he borrowed a peck of rice and could last another day.

He wondered why his wife couldn't borrow rice, but the orderly could borrow a peck of rice in less than half an hour. It turned out that the orderly was a local from Chengdu, and his family was considered well-off. He became an orderly because he was afraid of being drafted. He deeply understood that the most sacred thing in life is life. With life, there will be a career. But, on the contrary, there are many people who want money more than life. Are they stupid? He could never answer this question and was caught in a state of contradiction.

A few days later, he saw a news item in the newspaper, which read, "So-and-so, a profiteer in this city, has been hoarding and manipulating the market and was executed today." After seeing this news, the problem of the past few days was answered, and he lived a poor instructor's life with peace of mind.

One day, he was teaching tactics to the students. When he was talking about how General Peng Dehuai surrounded the enemy and how he directed the annihilation of the enemy, he suddenly collapsed. Everyone was immediately frightened and reported to the officer to ask the medical officer to check. It was found that it was not an acute illness, but neurasthenia and malnutrition. He would be fine after a while. The medical officer left, and the students were still surrounding him, worrying about the instructor's old bones. After a while, he really recovered. The students asked him, "What's the matter?" He said, "The subsidized rice is not enough to eat, and I can't afford the black market rice. At noon, I have to eat porridge, so when I was lecturing, I suddenly felt the house spinning, and I fainted without knowing it." He wanted to continue lecturing, but the students said in unison, "Instructor, take care of your health. Go back and rest!" He had no choice but to accept the students' sincerity and slowly walked home.

As soon as he got back, he lay down on the bed and muttered to himself, "How long will this day last? Alas! I don't know if I will live to see the victory of the war." Unexpectedly, his eldest child heard him and quickly comforted his father, "Dad! Don't worry, the war will be won one day. Maybe victory is tomorrow. Please wait patiently!" He felt that his son's words were quite optimistic, so he never sighed or complained, buried himself in hard work, and quietly waited for the good news to come.

This was March of the thirty-third year [of the Republic, i.e., 1944], only five months away from victory. The god of misfortune descended on his side again. Three people in the family were sick. First, his wife suffered from paralysis. One after another, his two sons had fever and chills. He didn't have a penny in his hand and tried every means to borrow, but it was never enough to cover the medical expenses for the three people. He was so anxious that he ran to the accounting office to borrow the only amount he needed, one thousand yuan. The accountant said, "Advances cannot be made before the end of the month, and besides, there is no money left in this office. It's better to find one thousand yuan elsewhere, Old Instructor, please forgive me!" A few short words, like official jargon, like perfunctory, this kind of answer was like pouring a basin of cold water on his head. His heart was cold. His nerves were frantic, cursing this evil world!

He thought, "Yesterday, the Director of Education borrowed 300,000 for his wedding, but today there is not a penny left. This is really ghostly." The more he thought about it, the angrier he became, the angrier he became, and the more anxious he became. But on the other hand, he did see his wife and two children sleeping on the sickbed. That kind of tragic situation broke his heart. He was caught in extreme pain. He complained about the war, complained about society, he wanted to escape reality, he believed that this was fate's decree, so he went out in the middle of the night on the pretext of asking a doctor, and never returned. The family was extremely anxious. The next morning, a corpse in a grassy green military uniform was found in the river outside the city. When they fished it up, it was this old instructor, Colonel Lin. He originally didn't go to ask a doctor, but committed suicide!

### Before Entering Society

— Fan Junjing

Mr. So-and-so said, "When young people are preparing to enter society and work, it is best to take on a teaching job in school for one or two years. Because here you can learn all the skills that you will apply to society in the future. For example, when your principal deducts your salary or other things, you must think that this is exactly the same as when you will be deducted by your superiors in the future. This is to train you to be able to endure being squeezed. Or, when your students cheat on exams, that's exactly the same as the cheating you'll find among the people around you in the future. There are so many, but you won't be as shocked as Grandma Liu entering the Grand View Garden like a "country bumpkin" because you're already used to it. Furthermore, when you are lecturing, if the classroom is so noisy that you can't teach, at first you may patiently persuade, warn, or get angry, even to the point of slamming the desk and scolding. But they are so indifferent, turning a blind eye. Eventually, you will gradually become indignant and you will never slam the desk and get angry again, even if the students in the entire classroom are fighting. By this time, your self-cultivation has reached a pure blue level, and you will never suffer big losses in society again. Or, when you are the tuition collector for your class, when you hear the wailing of the parents of those students who can't afford tuition and have to refuse their children's admission, that is the time to train you to harden your heart because this is also one of the necessary conditions for you to enter society. Moreover… everything, everything you can know and learn here in advance. Although it is so little, it is still much better than you entering that dangerous place—society—empty-handed.”

### Sent to My Deceased Wife, Feng Jun (12)

— Zhou Shoujuan

The twenty-eighth day of the first month of the lunar calendar in the twenty-seventh year of the Republic [i.e., 1938] was the twentieth anniversary of our marriage, which Westerners call a "china anniversary." But we are refugees outside our home, unable to hold any celebrations. We only prepared some dishes and the whole family ate a meal together. I also wrote a Jiang Cheng Mei Hua Yin poem to express my feelings: "Twenty years of hard work as Liang Hong [a devoted couple]. Sharing poverty and wealth. Sharing east and west. Except for being away from home, we always share the same quilt. I have a hidden sorrow, I know it myself. Neither complaint nor worry, but comfort you. Comfort you, comfort you, our hearts intertwined. With womanly grace. Frugal demeanor. Saying, saying, never finishing saying the four virtues and three obediences. Month after month, drifting like wormwood, I pity your emaciation. Wishing you good health and a strong appetite, take the children and walk on the sunny peak. Look at the snow pines." In this poem, you can see how grateful I am for your virtue. Those Christians use the Thursday of the last month of November as 'Thanksgiving Day,' and this twenty-eighth day of the first month of the lunar calendar, our wedding anniversary, can be said to be my personal 'Thanksgiving Day.' Heaven and earth are endless, and my gratitude to you is also endless!

The fifth day of the second month of the lunar calendar was the anniversary of the death of our deceased son, Rong. I had forgotten it. When I woke up from my sleep early that morning, I heard you weeping, soaking a large part of the pillow. I was surprised and asked you: Why are you crying again for no reason? You choked and said: "Have you forgotten? Today is the fifth day of the second month, and Rong'er has been dead for a year." So I also wept and wrote two Dong Xian Ge poems to express my pain: "Rage breaks the dream. Hearing the sound of sorrow, I see my beloved shedding tears like rain. Asking who she is hating for no reason, she only chokes and says it is the fifth day of the second month. On this day last year, the spring tide rose in the clear pond, and suddenly he rode a whale and went riding the waves. The jade tree is painfully buried forever. There is no soup to extend life, only a frightened soul and a bitter heart. Pain this after, when the lanterns are bright in the hall, my son is missing, as is the Lai robe song and dance." "A sad wind and bitter rain, burying his spirit in the depths of Lingyan Mountain, with a hundred birds and a thousand flowers seeming to mourn. Waiting to search the covered casket, things are present but the person is gone, grief everywhere embeds your sound, Jin laughter. A year passes in the blink of an eye, a catastrophe descends, and the mountains and rivers of the homeland are provided to the robbers. Traveling and sighing in a foreign land, drifting aimlessly with no home to return, I hate that I am not allowed to sing in my home garden. If my son's soul wants to fly here today, I fear that mountains and waters are layered over each other, making it difficult to find him." For three days in a row, you were always unhappy, so I wrote an Qiu Bo Mei poem to comfort you: "Life is like a kaleidoscope. It turns into nothing in the blink of an eye. Heartbreaking times, sad scenes, are best left to the east wind. Seeing that you are haggard like an autumn willow, how can there be the old beauty! Striving to dispel sorrow and forcing yourself to eat, is considered to be showing pity on me." I sang the poem to you and emphasized the sentence "is considered to be showing pity on me." For my sake, you suppressed your sorrow and stopped being so miserable.

We stayed in Nanping Mountain Village for three and a half months. In the blink of an eye, the season of peaches and plums blooming had arrived. Our friends in Shanghai sent telegrams urging us to come, and Professor Hao Xianshu of Soochow University happened to be suffering from an eye disease and urgently needed to go to Shanghai for treatment, so I accompanied him to set off. The families of both of us followed along. We transferred from the Xin'an River to the Lanxi River and the Qujiang River, changing boats seven times and sailing for thirteen days before finally arriving in Shanghai. We lived in the home of Brother Zhang Zhenhou Pu, which was very disruptive. We moved to Lusina Road in West Shanghai. During the hot summer, a family of ten was crammed into a three-story building, which was very stuffy. In the early winter, we unfortunately suffered a robbery. In addition to stealing some cash, they also lost the wedding ring that you had worn on your finger for twenty years. You thought that this was an ominous omen and were always depressed in your heart. Who knew that it would be fulfilled nine years later, tearing our old couple of twenty-nine years apart! At that time, we were like frightened birds and dared not live there any longer. With the great help of our old friend, Brother Li Xinpu, we found a new house in the Yu Garden Road Farm and settled down, living there for eight years. During these eight years, you won praise from your neighbors for being approachable and kind. They saw that our children were all well-behaved and obedient, and that the two of us never quarreled, so they considered it a miracle and called us a model family. All of this should be attributed to you. I would never dare to take credit for it.

### Psychology

— Junjie Kan

Young men and women walking on the street often like to look at their own reflections in the large shop windows in front of the shops, admiring themselves and feeling proud. A certain store took advantage of this psychology and placed a very large mirror in the shop window. As a result, business boomed.

In the United States, the sale of alcohol is prohibited except on holidays, which is a blow to alcoholics. Once, a newspaper published an advertisement with the general meaning:

"Our company has newly invented a kind of grape juice, which is delicious and palatable. Please buy it, but pay special attention not to mix this juice with yeast, so as not to deteriorate and turn into alcohol, which would violate government regulations."

As a result, the grape juice sold out.
