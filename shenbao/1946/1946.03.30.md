[Our Northern Plain Correspondent, 29th] The Executive Headquarters issued Announcement No. 20 on the 29th, stating that Brigadier General Byroade flew to Jinzhou on the 29th. He will stay briefly at the Northeast Headquarters to discuss everything with government officials and intends to arrange a meeting between the Nationalist and Communist authorities. Based on the basic principles agreed upon by the Military Affairs Trio, it was decided to first send four teams to Shenyang, leaving a central team in Shenyang to manage the liaison and communication between the teams. The head of this team is U.S. Colonel Detile. The locations of the other teams will be determined after arriving in Shenyang. It is also learned that the four teams will depart on the 30th, with Huang Jiexin, Wu Nengding, Cai Wenyu, and Chen Xianl√º representing the government. Following this, a special plane will carry reporters there. The Chinese Communists will have a plane to Yan'an to pick up working cadres. Mediation Department representative Robertson is currently in Chongqing participating in the Trio talks.

[Our Chongqing Correspondent, 29th] The Executive Team dispatched by the Beiping Executive Headquarters is about to depart for the Northeast. General Zhang Zhizhong met with Zhou Enlai yesterday and had a candid conversation for over forty minutes, discussing the Northeast ceasefire issue and military conflicts in areas like Eastern Jiangxi and Northern Hubei. It is also learned that Zhang Zhizhong has gone to Xinjiang to take office, and the replacement to participate in the Military Affairs Trio conference to inspect the Northeast has not yet been decided. It is rumored that Zhang Qun will succeed him, but Zhang plans to go to Chengdu to handle provincial government affairs and is scheduled to return to Chongqing on the 30th.

[U.S. News Service, Northern Plain, 29th] The Mediation Executive Department's planned actions for the turbulent Northeast have already begun today. Brigadier General Byroade, the director of the department, left here on the morning of the 29th to prepare everything for the four mobile "ceasefire" teams soon to be dispatched to the Northeast. The goal is to establish a foundation and then resolve the difficult military issues in the Northeast provinces. The dispatch of the Executive Teams to the Northeast is a major step in the work of the Mediation Executive Department. Each Executive Team has been ordered by the committee to work only on military adjustments and must go to conflict areas or locations where Nationalist and Communist troops are in contact to promote a ceasefire and fair adjustments as needed. The four Executive Teams will initially remain in Shenyang, as it is easier to travel from that city to various dangerous areas. A major team will remain in Shenyang to maintain control and liaison with the departing teams. The work locations of the other teams will not be announced until the teams arrive in Shenyang.

[Central News Agency, Northern Plain, 28th] The Executive Teams dispatched by the Executive Department, to date, total twenty-five teams. In addition, there are transportation teams responsible for reconstruction work and the four teams going to the Northeast, bringing the total to thirty-six teams.

[French News Agency, Tianjin, 28th] The Beiping Military Mediation Department will dispatch the First Executive Team to Shenyang within two days and then send them to inspect various conflict locations within a thirty-mile radius around the city. The estimated number of non-government troops in the Northeast is 300,000. The main conflict area is around Shenyang, and large Nationalist troops have entered the area.

[Our Northern Plain Correspondent, 29th] The Northeast Headquarters personnel were originally scheduled to arrive in Shenyang on the 25th, but due to holding review meetings for days, the date has been changed to the 5th of next month. The complete move to Shenyang will have to wait a while, as the housing is not yet ready. Liang Huasheng, Deputy Commander of the Northeast Headquarters, will go to Changchun within a day or two. Zhao Jiaxiang, Chief of Staff, went to Shenyang on official business on the morning of the 29th and will return to Zhen on the 30th.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 29th] Huang Yanping flew back here from Jinzhou at 2:00 PM on the 29th. Zhu Xinmin, a member of the delegation, returned with him. Reception personnel returning from Changchun to Jinzhou are not allowed to enter the customs without Xiong Wangren's approval but must transfer to Shenyang and other places to participate in the reception work.

[Our Changchun Correspondent, 28th] Your correspondent arrived in Changchun from Harbin last night. The Northeast Headquarters at the Mantan Building presents a bleak scene, filled with tension. Various reception personnel are leaving in succession, and most of the headquarters staff have also gone to Jinzhou to work. However, the military delegation has remained here in its entirety. Delegation leader Dong Yanping went to Jinzhou on official business yesterday. The delegation is preparing to advance north with the Soviet troops. Rumors are circulating in the city that Communist troops will besiege the urban area on a certain day, so the security forces remaining here cannot but make defense plans. Sandbags are piled up at various important strongholds, creating a state of wartime. The situation is very tense, with many gunshots heard in the suburbs last night. Four trucks falsely using headquarters license plates were also intercepted yesterday. A civil war is about to break out here, and the people are at a loss. However, last night's broadcast from Beiping reported that the Jinzhou Northeast Headquarters is still studying how to unify reception methods, perhaps to stabilize people's hearts. Harbin is outwardly calm, and the Soviet troops have not yet withdrawn. Communist troops surround the four suburbs. Not a single soldier is in Songjiang or Harbin. Although the former Soviet troops have expressed responsibility for maintaining order, your correspondent observes that when the Soviet troops withdraw and our troops have not yet arrived, Harbin and Songjiang Province will be handed over without a fight, or there will be no war. Furthermore, the murderer of Li Zhaolin has been apprehended. His name is Kong Qingyun, a native of Liaoning. According to his confession, it was to avenge a personal grudge from when he organized the anti-Japanese army. The Harbin municipal government has transferred Kong to the Soviet military for continued interrogation. Furthermore, Zhang Xingbang, the bandit leader of Harbin, was executed by hanging on the 28th, greatly pleasing the people.

### The Entire Eastern Section of the Longhai Railway is Repaired; Opening to Traffic Still Awaits Agreement; Jinan-Dezhou Highway Begins Operation

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 29th] According to sources in the transportation sector, the Xuhai section of the Eastern Longhai Road will soon be completed and will be open to the country in five days.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 29th] The entire Eastern section of the Longhai Railway has been repaired, but the issue of opening to traffic still awaits agreement. Furthermore, the Communist army has admitted that they individually controlled the Eastern section of the Longhai after the ceasefire order took effect.

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 29th] The three-party representatives of the Military Mediation Department's Jiaoji Railway Gaomi Team have held eight meetings, but have consistently failed to obtain the Communist Party representatives' consent to start road repairs. The Military Mediation Department has specially dispatched the Railway Management Section Chief to fly from Beiping to Qingdao on the 29th for on-site inspection.

### Many Factories in Jinan are Closed; Authorities Will Assist in Resumption of Work

[Our Jinan Correspondent, 29th] Before the war, Jinan's industrial development ranked second in Shandong Province, only after Qingdao. Most of these were cotton mills and flour mills. Except for some destruction during the enemy puppet era, they were generally able to maintain their integrity. After the victory, due to the Communist army's blockade, raw materials and fuel sources were difficult to obtain. In addition, most of the Japanese technicians have been sent back to their country, causing the factories to fall into a state of suspension. Currently, less than ten percent of the factories are in operation, and the number of unemployed workers is increasing daily. The authorities have recently begun to pay attention to this and will soon start an investigation to prepare to assist manufacturers in resuming work.

"To His Excellency Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force of the Republic of China, from May 1943 to September 1945, for his distinguished leadership of the Chinese nation in its resistance against Japanese aggression. Shortages of aircraft, modern weapons, and other vital materiel created almost insurmountable difficulties, but His Excellency Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek steadfastly persevered, inspiring Chinese forces to hold their ground and to inflict heavy losses upon more than a million enemy troops over vast areas and rugged terrain in China. His resolute determination to expel the enemy from the mainland of China culminated in ultimate victory, forcing the Japanese to retreat, surrender, and end the war. His courage, ingenuity, political skill, and unswerving faith that final victory would reward his long-suffering people contributed in no small measure to the success of the Allied war effort."

### Councilors Review Reception Work; Suggest Organizing Committee to Thoroughly Investigate Reception and Handling of Materials

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 29th] The various review committees of the Council of Political Affairs, except for the Third Special Review Committee, continued to meet this morning to review proposals. The Third Special Review Committee was originally scheduled to hold a meeting tonight, but due to a conflict with the meeting time of the Fourth Review Committee, it has been changed to 8:00 PM tomorrow night.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 29th] The Council of Political Affairs held its thirteenth meeting at 3:20 PM on the 29th. Weng Wenhao and Yu Feipeng attended to answer questions regarding economic and transportation reports and to review issues regarding the reception of enemy puppet materials and industries. Chairman Wang Yunwu attended. 192 councilors were present. After the Secretariat reported, Ministers Weng and Yu provided written answers to the various inquiries and then gave oral responses. Weng first explained the reason why China does not mine gold but uses U.S. dollars, saying that it was because the government adopted a gold policy to recover legal tender, and therefore borrowed heavily from the United States. Moreover, the cost of gold mining increased with commodity prices, and many of China's gold mines are currently closed. Weng also said that the reason why factories in the rear closed down and many factories in the front had not resumed work was due to inconvenient transportation and the significant impact of inflation, with many difficulties. However, the government had actively tried to help the factories in the rear, and the government would naturally strengthen its efforts to resume work in the factories in the front. Minister Yu answered the question of whether transportation enterprises should be state-owned or privately-owned, saying that laws such as the Railway Law already stipulated that those belonging to the national scope should be state-owned in principle. Local transportation should be operated by local governments and private enterprises. Highways, waterways, and air transport can also be state-owned or privately-owned. Yu continued, saying that the cancellation of the registration of China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) was decided by the Executive Yuan, perhaps due to the reasons of registered routes and foreign exchange. He then explained the reasons for black market train tickets and slow telegrams. Councilors Li Zhongnang and Xu Deheng proposed that the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and the Nanchang-Xunyang Railway should be restored as soon as possible, and Duanmu Kai questioned the CNAC case, saying that the government should value the rights of the people. Minister Yu replied that he would submit this opinion to the government for decision. After a ten-minute break, the meeting continued to review the issue of receiving enemy puppet materials and industries. First, the proposer, Liu Shumo, explained the reason for the proposal. The councilors then spoke in succession, summarizing the main points as follows: In Jinan, factories that were received are stealing and selling raw materials. How should labor unrest in the rear, such as the Daduhe case, be handled? Those who are corrupt in the reception work should be severely punished. The reception situation in Guangzhou, Hainan Island, Taiwan, and other places is chaotic, evolving into a competition between large and small agencies, a competition between agencies and the people. Air Force reception of farms has ships without coal and cars without gasoline, and superiors and subordinates deceive each other, competing for profits. These malpractices have greatly affected the government's credibility. Councilor Wang Puhan and others advocated organizing an investigation team to thoroughly investigate the situation of enemy puppet materials received in various places. Finally, the meeting decided: (1) To recommend that the government organize a committee to investigate the reception and handling of enemy puppet materials, and the organizational methods will be formulated by the presidium and submitted to the general meeting for approval. (2) Reports from councilors on cases of corruption in reception in various places will be sent to the government for investigation and handling. The meeting adjourned at 6:50 PM.

### U.S. Military Advisory Group to Stay in China for Five Years, Helping China Build a Modern Army, Group of Young Officers to Go to the U.S. for Training in August

[United Press, Nanjing, 29th Dispatch] Major General McClure, head of the U.S. Military Advisory Group in China, told United Press reporters today that the group is currently in the organizational stage and will be formally established before or after the dissolution of the China Theater. He said that the group includes various departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and its headquarters will be located in Nanjing, the capital of China, maintaining close contact with the Chinese Military Affairs Commission. Representatives will also be assigned to important troops and training centers throughout the country. He said that the group, at the invitation of Chairman Chiang, will stay in China for at least five years, and the stay can be extended if the Chinese government needs it afterwards. The group's goal is to help modernize the Chinese army and completely change the Chinese people's perception of modern national defense forces. General McClure believes that it is most important for China to focus on equipping a small but modern army, navy, and air force, infantry, and long-range artillery, because armored units are not suitable for operating in the mountains of North China and the rice paddies of South China. Air force bomber squadrons are also important because their function is equivalent to long-range artillery. He believes that China lacks the economic and industrial strength to maintain a modern navy, but the navy cannot be ignored, and the training of Chinese sailors has already begun in Qingdao by U.S. Navy personnel. He believes that in building a new modern national defense force in China, the training, supply, leadership, and quality of the army are more important than quantity. Improving these aspects will be the main task of the U.S. Military Advisory Group in China.

[Another Dispatch] Today, authoritative sources here revealed that the Chinese government is planning to send 350 young army, navy, and air force officers to the United States for one year of training in August. After completion, they will return to the country and serve as instructors in 22 military schools throughout the country. These sources pointed out that General Marshall's plan to reduce the Chinese army to 60 divisions by September 1, 1947, requires a large number of well-trained officers. Establishing 22 military officer schools will help achieve this goal. The 350 young officers going to the United States for training will become the core of these military schools. It is heard that the examination of these candidates will begin soon, and will be specifically handled by the U.S. authorities in China.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 29th Dispatch] In order to accurately understand the actual situation of troops throughout the country and prepare for army reorganization, the Ministry of Military Affairs has specially dispatched liaison officers to be stationed in various armies throughout the country, responsible for liaison and inspection, and will conduct detailed investigations on the military discipline, personnel, horses, weapons, ammunition, office supplies, in-kind supplies, and uniforms and equipment of various armies throughout the country, and report them to the ministry for record. This work has officially begun in North China and the Northeast. There are currently fourteen military and political liaison officers who have flown to Beiping from Chongqing, totaling seven groups. After arriving in Beiping, each group has already transferred to the garrisons of various armies. The military and political liaison group of the 16th Army, Li Wucheng and Luo Huixun, have arrived at the headquarters of the 16th Army and will begin work immediately.

### U.S. Bureau of Reclamation Designs Grand Dam on the Yangtze River, Estimated Cost of 1 Billion Yuan, Taking 5-6 Years, Large Ships Pass Through the Dam Using Cranes

[Associated Press, Denver, Colorado, 28th Dispatch] Designers at the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation are currently drawing up plans for the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River in China. Savage, the design director of the bureau, has completed the draft. The Boulder Dam in the United States, which is the world's leading dam, was designed by Savage. Savage is currently a consulting engineer for the Chinese government. The U.S. assistance to China in building the Three Gorges Dam is limited to design work, and the Chinese government will pay 500,000 yuan. The main purposes of building the Yangtze River Dam are to utilize hydropower for power generation and to facilitate irrigation. However, the people in the Yangtze River basin will benefit from more than this, because after the dam is completed, the Yangtze River will no longer flood, and the people will not have to suffer from displacement. The construction of the dam is estimated to cost 1 billion yuan and may take five to six years to complete. However, once built, it will overshadow other dams. The dam will be built in the middle of the Yichang basin, reaching a height of 750 feet, which is 24 feet higher than the Boulder Dam, and can stop 250 miles of water flow. This water flow can irrigate 10 million acres of farmland. Its power generation is three times greater than the combined power generation of the Boulder Dam, the Grand Coulee Dam in Washington State, and the Shasta Dam. It is expected that the cost of building the dam will be compensated for by this electricity. According to Savage's plan, after the dam is built, navigation on the Yangtze River will not be hindered. Large ships passing through the dam can be lifted by cranes and then placed on the waterway. As for sampans and small boats, they will be placed in huge metal buckets and lifted over the dam, like fish in a net. Savage once said with a smile: "I will feel disappointed if no one says 'this method cannot be realized'." According to the contract between the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and the Chinese government, the bureau will provide a final report on preliminary research, hydraulic tests, pressure and stability design, and the amount of funds required. It is reported that the chief engineer in charge of the dam design in Denver is Young.

Editorial

### Iran and the United Nations

The United Nations, as an institution, is now facing an unprecedented crisis. Whether this crisis can be safely overcome, resolving various difficulties, and continue to move forward on the path of maintaining world peace depends on how the Iranian issue is resolved in the future. The Security Council meeting on the 27th was abruptly adjourned when the Soviet representative's request to postpone the discussion of the Iranian issue was not accepted. Although the meeting continued, listening to the Iranian representative's report on the dispute over the Soviet withdrawal, the absence of the Soviet Union from the eleven-member council was still a drawback. The British cabinet held a meeting the next day to review the new situation caused by this. The US President stated that he fully supported US Secretary of State Byrnes' position and was not concerned about the possibility of the Soviet Union withdrawing from the Security Council. The development of the situation to this point shows that the differences of opinion among the victorious countries after the Second World War have reached a serious degree on the surface. The safety of the world and the welfare of mankind are now closely related, and we cannot help but turn our attention to the Iranian issue that caused the dispute, and the importance of how the United Nations will handle this issue in the future is worthy of people's attention.

Regarding the Iranian issue, when the United Nations convened in London last year, the Iranian government filed a complaint with the United Nations. After a war of words, during which there were indeed many interesting scenes to watch, the issue was handed over to Iran and the Soviet Union for direct negotiations. At the same time, the autonomous movement in Azerbaijan Province occurred, and the Iranian government, in order to preserve the integrity of Iran's territory and sovereignty, was unwilling to make excessive concessions. Therefore, although the Iranian Prime Minister made a trip to Moscow, no agreement was reached. Although the British and American troops stationed in Iran withdrew as scheduled on March 2, the Soviet Union not only did not withdraw its troops but also showed signs of increasing its troops in Iran. As a result, the Iranian government once again filed a complaint with the United Nations. Unexpectedly, just three hours before the United Nations Security Council meeting, the Soviet Union suddenly announced its troop withdrawal. On the one hand, the Soviet Union requested the United Nations Security Council to postpone the meeting, and on the other hand, after the request was not granted, it suddenly announced two hours before the meeting, to deal with this international gathering in a new form. Therefore, at the first meeting of the Security Council, the Soviet representative opposed including the Iranian issue on the agenda and announced that the Soviet army would continue to withdraw from Iran from March 24, and that unless an "unexpected event" occurred, the withdrawal of the Soviet army could be completed within five or six weeks.

However, the United States' view is different from that of the Soviet Union. US Secretary of State Byrnes stated at the Security Council meeting that Iran had submitted the above-mentioned issue to the Security Council and pointed out that the Soviet Union's actions had threatened world security and peace. The Iranian Ambassador to the United States wrote to the US government on March 18, stating that the Soviet army continued to be stationed in Iran after March 2 and interfered in Iran's internal affairs. Although the Soviet Union has now claimed to have reached an agreement with Iran, since the Soviet Union and Iran have not jointly issued a statement to the Security Council, we should not refuse to listen to the debate on the Iranian issue. British representative Jebb also stated that the British side fully agreed with Byrnes's claim. At this point, the Soviet representative had to take delaying measures again. Seeing that the postponement of the Security Council meeting had been rejected, and the failure to include the Iranian issue on the agenda had not been approved by the General Assembly, the Soviet Union requested that the Iranian issue be discussed again on April 10, and then made a threat: If the General Assembly discusses the Iranian issue before April 10, the Soviet side will withdraw from the meeting. As a result, the meeting formed a serious deadlock, and the Soviet representative finally stormed out of the meeting in anger. It is still unknown whether they will attempt to break the situation outside the meeting in the future.

What is noteworthy is Iran's attitude. According to a Reuters dispatch from New York on the 27th, the Iranian Ambassador to the United States, Ala, has been authorized by the Iranian government to protest to the Security Council against the continued occupation of northern Iran by the Soviet army and interference in Iran's internal affairs. The Soviet representative expressed doubt at the Security Council meeting as to whether Ambassador Ala was authorized to speak on behalf of the Iranian government, but the Iranian side pointed out that Ambassador Ala had maintained constant contact with Tehran in the past few days. A dispatch from Tehran also confirmed that the Iranian government had not reached an agreement to resolve the dispute. According to a report from this newspaper, according to London Broadcasting, the Iranian Prime Minister denied that he had reached a new agreement with the Soviet Union on the issue of the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Iran; this statement seems to be quite reliable, because the Iranian side has never agreed to postpone the Security Council's discussion of the Iranian issue. Observers believe that the Soviet Union's reasons for requesting a postponement are twofold: (1) The negotiations on the Iranian oil production issue may be concluded before April 10; (2) The reorganization of the Iranian government and the status of Azerbaijan may have been decided by then.

From the above reports, we can see the direction of the Iranian situation. From the perspective of the United Nations, the Iranian issue is a touchstone for the United Nations as an institution. Whether the United Nations as an institution can maintain lasting world peace depends on how this Iranian issue is resolved. From a legal point of view, this Iranian issue was a complaint filed by the Iranian government with the United Nations, and the Iranian government has not withdrawn this complaint. Therefore, the Security Council should proceed with the discussion as usual and should not postpone it because of the Soviet Union's attitude. If a puppet regime appears in Iran in the future, it will make this Iranian issue more complicated. At this moment, it is inevitable for the United Nations as an institution to express its position righteously and sternly. It must be understood that there are many problems like the Iranian issue that are brewing in the world. If the Iranian issue cannot be resolved reasonably and legally in the United Nations, and cannot be based on justice and adherence to treaties to maintain international peace, then the world will still be a world dominated by power politics, and the goals of the Atlantic Charter and the United Nations Charter will be farther and farther away. Although we do not want to say that the seeds of a future world war will be sown in these places, the result of the great powers being driven by selfish motives, leading to a loss of rationality, will inevitably cause the world's human beings to suffer an unprecedented disaster in the atomic age. We eagerly hope for world peace and eagerly hope for human justice. May the United Nations and the countries, large and small, participating in the United Nations, truly open their hearts and minds, treat each other with sincerity, stand on an equal footing, and resolve all international disputes, not only the Iranian issue. Although the League of Nations in the past was incompetent, it still had the Lytton Report, which made the truth of the Northeast situation known to the world. The United Nations as an institution is what all mankind expects, and it has a heavy responsibility to maintain world peace. In the face of the difficult situation of the Iranian issue, it should make a strong performance!

### Huanghuagang Martyrs' Memorial Day, Various Agencies in the City Jointly Held a Memorial Meeting in the Auditorium of the Provisional Council, Recalling the Origin of the Fruits of Victory, the Achievements of the Martyrs Cannot Be Erased

[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday was the Huanghuagang Martyrs' Memorial Day. The Municipal Government, the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Songhu Garrison Command, the Three People's Principles Youth League, the Shanghai Provisional Council, and other organizations jointly held a memorial meeting at 9:00 AM yesterday in the auditorium of the Council at No. 111 Nanchang Road. Mayor Qian, Li Ji, Guan, and other government leaders, as well as more than one hundred provisional councilors attended. The ceremony was simple and solemn. The councilors' and guests' seats in the venue were removed, and everyone stood in line solemnly. Mayor Qian served as chairman, briefly recounted the martyrdom of the Huanghuagang martyrs, and delivered a speech saying:

Mayor Qian's Speech

"Today, when we commemorate the revolutionary martyrs, in accordance with the central government's regulations, we are not only commemorating the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang, but also all revolutionary martyrs, whether they died for the country or died from overwork, are all commemorated on this day. Therefore, the significance of this memorial day is even greater. Especially this year, which is the first year after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, we are here to commemorate the martyrs, witnessing the achievement of victory, and recalling the origin of this achievement. We must be concerned about the preservation and promotion of this achievement, feel grateful for the past, and encourage the future. All kinds of emotions arise at the same time, and we feel the greatness and importance of this meaning even more. To be worthy of, and to repay the martyrs who sacrificed for the country, the most important thing is to inherit their unfinished ambitions, realize the Three People's Principles, and create a prosperous and strong new China. Looking back at the general situation today, the distance from the martyrs' goals is still far away. Therefore, I hope that all compatriots across the country will stand on their respective positions and work hard separately. Those of us who are handling Shanghai's municipal administration should make earnest efforts to build a glorious and splendid new Shanghai. At the same time, I hope that all councilors will give practical guidance and practical assistance in order to complete our common mission, so that we will not fail to live up to the meaning of our revolutionary martyrs' memorial."

Speaker Xu's Speech

Then, Speaker Xu Jiguang delivered a speech, briefly saying: "Today is the Revolutionary Martyrs' Memorial Day. It is the memorial day of the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang who threw their heads and shed their blood for the sake of overthrowing the thousands of years of monarchical autocracy and for the sake of fighting for democracy and freedom. I have two points that I want to report to you and encourage you to work together. First, the nine-year sacred and great War of Resistance Against Japan finally ended in victory. The Shanghai Provisional Council was also established not long after the victory. We are able to gather here today to hold a meeting and commemorate. When drinking water, we must think of the source. We must not forget the revolutionary martyrs who led the way for the people and sacrificed their lives for blood. In today's memorial meeting, let us silently think about how we should sincerely accept their gifts. Second, our country has now jumped from a shameful semi-colonial status to become one of the world's four major powers. But if we think carefully, can our military, economic, political...various conditions really be on par with the world's powers? If our conditions are not enough, this is very dangerous. We should be deeply vigilant, unite our efforts from top to bottom, and catch up in order to avoid falling from the position of a first-class country. Today our slogan should be to move forward on the bloodstained footsteps of the martyrs, work hard and strive to build a new China." After the speech, the meeting was adjourned at 9:30 AM.

### City Provisional Council Holds First Meeting Today

[Report from this newspaper] The City Provisional Council is scheduled to hold its first general meeting at 9:00 AM today to begin discussing various proposals.

Tradition Calls for Improvement of Material Rationing

[Report from this newspaper] Councilor Tong Xian and others plan to submit two proposals: (1) Requesting the government to allocate 30% of the education funds to the Shanghai education community to restore and develop the city's education, and to allocate a portion of it to subsidize private schools so that they can continue to maintain themselves. (2) Requesting the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to use all the proceeds from the sale of materials for relief purposes and not to take it as the administrative expenses of the agency. At the same time, it is proposed that although the various materials sold by the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration are called fair prices, they are actually not much different from market prices, and there are also uneven distribution issues. In the future, they should be distributed to each household in the city according to the population.

Local Autonomy Association Provides 20 Opinions

The Shanghai Local Autonomy Advancement Association has submitted an important municipal opinion letter to the City Provisional Council, which includes (1) abolishing exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies to reduce the people's burden, (2) improving the treatment and quality of the military police, and thoroughly preventing stray soldiers and vagrants from forcibly taking people's property, etc., (3) the enemy and puppet property handling agencies should promptly announce the received accounts and submit half of them for municipal construction funds, (4) political traitors and economic traitors should be arrested as soon as possible, (5) the Shanghai branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration should improve its relief work and adopt a direct relief method that goes deep into the people.

### Police Officers Must Not Check Pedestrians Without Orders

[Report from this newspaper] According to a secret report from the Municipal Police Department, recently, the captains of various branches and police teams under the department have often intercepted pedestrians and military vehicles arbitrarily without orders while on duty, and privately inspected them, extorting them on the pretext. This is especially true in the suburbs. The authorities of the bureau believe that this kind of out-of-bounds action not only tarnishes the reputation of the police but also harms the citizens. Therefore, they ordered their subordinates to investigate and ban it in order to reassure merchants and travelers. If police officers have the above-mentioned behavior in the future, once it is verified, they will be severely punished without leniency, and it is hoped that the victims will secretly report and report at any time.

### From a Row of Neat Boots and Shoes, Their Entire Lives are Revealed. A Group of Innocent and Lively Girls and Women Simply Do Not Want to Return. The Women's Auxiliary Corps in Shanghai

‚Äî Our Newspaper Reporter Fang Dan

"Our Newspaper Special" When you are strolling down the street and see American Jeeps speeding between trams and cars, have you ever noticed that the drivers of those Jeeps are also smiling women? Wearing the same green woolen uniforms, only with skirts below; the same rank insignia on their arms or collars; the same jaunty boat-shaped hats, but beneath them, beautiful and charming faces; and hands on the steering wheel with manicured and red-painted nails. They are just as strong and brave, just as full of joyful enthusiasm; for the enthusiasm for work, they crossed the Pacific Ocean, crossed the "Hump," and came to wartime China in 1944.

They are the Women's Auxiliary Corps (Women Army Corps), assisting the American military in their work. There are over a hundred of them. They first arrived in Chongqing, where they lived in the American headquarters within Qiujing Middle School in Chongqing. After the victory, a small number were transferred to Guangzhou, and the majority moved to Shanghai with the American headquarters. At this time, there are a total of over eighty left in Shanghai, working for the American military as secretaries, typists, stenographers, and photographers.

A neat building on Judah Road, with balconies and lawns, originally a private residence of a Japanese banker, now serves as their headquarters. Downstairs are the dining room, living room, and lounge; the second and third floors are bedrooms. Stoves are everywhere, burning warmly. Although there is no sign that says "Men are Prohibited" at the staircase, just by looking at the expectant eyes of two young G.I.s in the waiting room under the stairs, it is clear that meetings must take place in the waiting room. The lounge is connected to the guest room, with comfortable and large sofas, a radio, and illustrated magazines. After coming out of the dining room, they sit down in the lounge to blow smoke rings and listen to music.

"Having traveled so far to China, do you miss home?" "No! Not at all!" This is an extremely frank and unadorned answer. In their country, the call for demobilization, aren't labor strikes surging? Women who came out into society during the war, replacing men, will not only be squeezed back into their families, but also suffer from the unemployment of their husbands or lovers. Now working for the American military in China, their food, clothing, and accommodation are all provided. Although the salary is not high (at least fifty yuan per month), they can buy cheap things at the P.X., where they can buy everything from lipstick and powder to food and toys. Now in America, girls are panicking about stockings, but at this time in Shanghai, as long as they have money, they can still buy them. "Do you encounter difficulties when shopping on the street?" "Of course, and sometimes you have to bargain." They say Shanghai is somewhat similar to New York, but perhaps that is where New York and Shanghai are not alike!

What explains their entire lives is the bedroom, the row of shoes arranged neatly under each bed: the clunky, sturdy boots, for running around on the street on rainy days; the half-heeled ordinary shoes, which are often worn with uniforms; the two or three pairs of delicate shoes with heels three inches off the ground, which make one think of wearing bare-shouldered evening gowns on Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays, aside from the neat and pressed uniforms, and twirling on the dance floor. Among these shoes that have traveled across the ocean, there are also Japanese-style clogs, which are used for bathing; even more, there are satin embroidered flat shoes trimmed with fur, which is where they appreciate this mysterious and ancient country when they come to China. "Do you like these shoes?" "Oh! They are extremely comfortable to wear!" Their satisfaction, without having to search beneath their long eyelashes, is already overflowing in their sweet tone.

From those hand-embroidered satin shoes to the exquisite high-heeled shoes that have traveled from afar, it also shows how far apart the two countries are! And they, these dozens of girls, live in the harmony of this distance, feeling comfortable, feeling satisfied, and they are about to "forget about their homeland in the joy of being here!"

On the beds covered with army blankets, there are large dolls; on the bookshelves, below are neat and crisp foreign books, but above are some so-called Chinese antiques, small figurines, small horses, and delicate potted landscapes, collected for them by Jewish merchants on Xiafei Road.

Managing them is Captain Rose Wagner, who has a very elegant and generous demeanor, and is also so young. "Do the girls get up regularly at six in the morning?" "Not necessarily. If they come back late at night, they can be more flexible." She replied with a smile. When she pointed out the white screen for showing movies, she said with a bit of humor: "There are movies here to keep the girls at home!" She also mentioned that the WAC girls are all unmarried.

At the beginning of next month, thirty of them will be able to return to their country, which should be a happy thing, but for them, it is not necessarily so. They have already regarded Shanghai as the New York of the East!

### The Three Public Guilds Telegraphically Request the Return of Remaining Seized Yarn and Cloth

The three public guilds of dyeing, weaving, cotton cloth, and yarn in this city have all been reorganized and convened their founding assembly. At that time, member representatives of each industry all raised proposals regarding the case of requesting the return of yarn and cloth forcibly requisitioned by the enemy and their puppets from the enemy property disposal authorities, and each entrusted the council of directors of the public guild to handle the matter with full authority and continue to strive for it. Yesterday, the three public guilds also sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan, providing their opinions: (1) The yarn and cloth were indeed forcibly purchased by the enemy and their puppets by relying on their power, and were not sold willingly. It seems that it should be deemed invalid in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Law. (2) The forced purchase price was less than 25% of the market price at the time. After three years, a quarter of the price has not yet been paid. This portion of yarn and cloth for which the price has not been paid should be reviewed with consideration and returned. (3) Although the enemy and their puppets stipulated at the time that a quarter of the price would be issued in the form of bonus money, the speed at which the price of yarn and cloth rose was far above the bonus money. It should be considered that businesses are in dire straits and be approved for return. (4) Among the remaining yarn and cloth, there is no yarn or cloth from enemy merchants. There is no difficulty in dividing what belongs to the enemy and what belongs to the merchants when returning it. (5) It is inevitable that checking and returning will be difficult due to repeated movements by the enemy and their puppets or the fact that the puppet merchant unified association has mixed things up a lot when handing them over. It is hoped that a reasonable method will be determined for remedy, but for a portion of the yarn and cloth that was ordered by the enemy and their puppets to be kept by the original households, and the original items are still there, it should be requested that it be approved for return as soon as possible. (6) After suffering this catastrophe, dyeing and weaving factories, cotton cloth stores, and yarn stores have declared bankruptcy in countless numbers. It is difficult to recover unless this remaining yarn and cloth is returned for relief immediately.

### Workers' Cost of Living Index Increases Dramatically; Several Newspaper Offices Consider Closing Down

The printing technicians of various newspaper offices in this city are currently requesting adjustments to their treatment in accordance with the workers' cost of living index. After the Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Government Labor-Management Dispute Mediation Committee approved its implementation, most newspaper offices reluctantly accepted it, but they all felt deeply that they could not bear the burden. According to reports, the workers' cost of living index in this city in March has risen to more than 2,750 times. If the salaries of printing technicians must be based on this standard, most newspaper offices will not be able to cope. Therefore, several newspaper office authorities are now considering announcing a shutdown when necessary.

### From a Manila Concentration Camp, a Female Doctor Bitterly Narrates the Atrocities of the Japanese

Hates Tomoyuki Yamashita to the Bone; the United Nations is Too Lenient Toward Japanese Criminals

Today, a reporter visited Ms. Gasha, a female doctor, the owner of "Yunshi Lu" at No. 6 Da Xi Road in this city. During the Japanese occupation of Manila, Gasha was trapped in a concentration camp for four years and is really one who can testify to the many who died in the battle. Among them, those who were governed by the Americans were the most numerous, so no American soldier in Manila did not know of Dr. Gasha. After the Japanese surrender, Gasha went to the United States to receive an award and only recently returned to Shanghai. It is said that during the Japanese occupation, thousands of people died in the concentration camp. Gasha once wrote to Marshal MacArthur, pointing out that the Japanese committed many evils during their banditry and submitted their list. When Mr. Yang, the former Chinese Consul General to the Philippines, was killed by the Japanese, Gasha was also present. She hates Tomoyuki Yamashita, the Tiger of Malaya, to the bone. She also said that the United Nations is too lenient to people and that many Japanese war criminals are still at large. Gasha solemnly stated that we should avenge the dead and uphold justice and should bring the Japanese to justice.

### Ticket Seller is Slapped; Soldiers Cause Dispute on Bus; French and Municipal Trolleybuses Stopped Service Yesterday Afternoon

[Our Newspaper] At about 2 p.m. yesterday, a French-owned 18th trolleybus arrived at the terminal station of the Great World, when a group of naval soldiers suddenly came and had a dispute over taking the bus. They grabbed ticket seller No. 264 and slapped him on both sides of the face. The ticket seller, unwilling to be humiliated for no reason, immediately stopped the 17th and 18th trolleybuses. Later, due to the persuasion of the military police patrol and the labor union, the service was restored at 4:15 p.m. Unexpectedly, some naval soldiers waited near Caishi Road and Kangti Road. When the trolleybus stopped at the station, they suddenly swarmed in, causing ticket sellers No. 628 and No. 383 to be beaten and injured. After receiving the news, the patrol team went to detain the 22 naval soldiers who caused the trouble and sent them to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters by the Taishan Police Station for investigation. Representatives of the trolleybus workers also went to the garrison headquarters to demand safety guarantees. The 17th and 18th trolleybuses had not resumed service as of late evening.

### After a Long Period of Rain, the Weather is Clear and the Source of Supply is Gradually Increasing; Rice Prices are Gradually Falling; the Tallow Oil Market Competition is Still Stable

Yesterday, the rice market saw the weather clear up, and people's hearts were weak. It was also heard that rice prices in the interior had fallen. As a result, both japonica and indica rice fell by 2,000 yuan. White and dark yuan also continued to fall by a small amount of 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. There were sources of supply from Hexia, Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, Tongli, Songjiang, Sijing, Jiaxing, Jiashan, Pinghu, Lili, and other places. The future of rice prices will not rise again for a while. The coarse grain market was closed and there was no market.

Due to a month of cloudy and rainy weather, the sales of tallow oil were not strong, but the source of supply has also become increasingly scarce, so the market can still be stable. Soap factories are still taking supplies one after another, but the selling price is still only slightly over 40,000 on the market scale. Therefore, sellers are not greedy, because goods without moisture from Hangzhou always cost between 44,000 and 45,000 yuan when they arrive in Shanghai. They can only be used as fuel, and this batch of sales will always be after the Qingming Festival.

### Limited Sales of Hardware

In recent months, overseas orders have arrived one after another, and hardware merchants have been busy shipping goods, with a tendency to be overwhelmed. However, once the orders arrive, the market becomes sluggish. This is because the actual sales of factories on this street are extremely limited. Those that have not resumed operations remain the same as before, and those that have started work have already accepted a large number of dump goods. Not only do they not need to purchase, but they also have a surplus. Out-of-town merchants have not been seen buying either. Since the route for sales is not moving, the spot goods are extremely soft, with an excess supply. However, this is only the initial arrival of goods. If they continue to arrive in the future, the situation will be even more unthinkable.

### New Company Law Various Fees

(2) When registering for the recognition of a foreign company, a registration fee of 1,000 yuan should be paid with the document, and a license fee of 500 yuan should be paid.

(3) If a company applies for registration due to an increase in capital, its registration fee should be paid at a rate of one in two thousand for the increased amount, and a license fee of 500 yuan should be paid.

(4) When a company or foreign company applies for registration to establish a branch, a license fee of 500 yuan should be paid with the document.

### Britain Hopes to Resolve the Sino-British Exchange Rate Problem Soon

### Malaya and Myanmar Eager to Import Chinese Cotton Textiles But Strictly Prohibit the Export of Local Goods

Singapore News: According to a recent announcement by the Minister of Commerce and Industry of Malaya, local importers who are allowed to allocate goods from cotton textile factories in Shanghai will be issued import permits by the authorities. However, cotton textiles shipped from China will be subject to control and may be transferred to the interior, because clothing materials in various parts of the interior are extremely scarce. Regarding the export side, it is said that he will consult with the Colonial Office to allow the export of certain goods, but major goods such as grain, tin, rubber, leather, and pepper are all on the prohibited import list. Because in January, the total value of rubber exported from Malaya to Hong Kong was 2 million yuan, which is more than the total for the entire year of 1939. As for pepper, the total value exported in the same month was also 2 million yuan, which is more than half of the total exported in the entire year of 1939.

### Machine-Made Ramie and Linen ‚Äì Popularity to Surge in the United States

[Reuters News Agency, New York, 29th] The textile industry is showing increasing interest in ramie fiber. This year, three ramie textile factories will be established near the Everglades in Florida. Extracting fiber from ramie stalks is traditionally done manually in China, but the United States has now invented a mechanical processing method.

### The Nation Enthusiastically Celebrated the First Youth Day After Victory Yesterday

[Report from this city] Yesterday was the 3rd Youth Day. National flags flew all over the city, and the long-awaited clear weather added to the brilliance. The Shanghai branch of the Three Principles of the People Youth League held the city's first victory celebration at the City Gymnasium at 10:00 AM, along with the swearing-in and flag-granting ceremony for the China Air Boy Scouts. More than 30 units participated, including the Three Principles of the People Youth League, various schools, and various occupational groups. Leaders of various agencies, including Mayor Qian Dajun, Director Wu Shaoshu, Deputy Commander Li Jilan, Director Wu Kaixian, and guests Chuan Xiaofeng, Shen Chunhui, Zhan Wenhufu, Mr. Karull, representative of the Boy Scouts of America, Mr. Golden, representative of the Boy Scouts of Britain, and honored veteran Wang Changxi, totaling more than 3,000 people.

Chairman of the Assembly Explains the Significance

The assembly began with a speech by Chairman Wu Shaoshu, who stated: Today is the 3rd Youth Day, and also the first time Shanghai commemorates our own youth festival with such a grand ceremony. This is different from other specific festivals, such as "April 4th" Children's Day, "June 6th" Teachers' Day, and "March 8th" Women's Day, which all have commemorative significance to some extent. March 29th is the anniversary of the martyrdom of the 72 martyrs of Huanghuagang. Thirty-five years ago today, these revolutionary youth used their heads and hot blood to shock the fatuous and corrupt Qing government, awakening the spirit of the Chinese nation and laying the foundation for the success of the Wuchang Uprising. This grand gathering of revolutionary youth is undoubtedly an indelible miracle in revolutionary history. Therefore, when our Three Principles of the People Youth League convened its first national representative assembly on March 29th, 1933, it passed a resolution to designate a day as Youth Day, and our leader, Chairman Chiang, specifically approved March 29th as that day. At this moment, our understanding of celebrating and commemorating Youth Day can be divided into three points: First, we must learn from the pure and ardent patriotism of the revolutionary martyrs of Huanghuagang, strive to complete the mission of national revival and construction, and achieve the goals of our revolutionary predecessors. Second, the country has undergone eight years of arduous struggle, and its vitality urgently needs to be restored. The economic construction of the Principle of People's Livelihood urgently needs to be developed. Our youth should display the spirit of national construction, bury our heads and work hard, strive to create, enable the country's economic construction to catch up, and move towards the path of modern culture. Third, the only task of our revolutionary youth is to remove all obstacles to national construction and realize the democratic politics of the Principle of People's Rights. Therefore, we must unite, and under the leadership of the Youth League, unite and struggle in order to complete the revolutionary mission of our democratic politics and achieve the goal of the third great union of revolutionary youth.

The Mayor Delivers a Speech Encouraging Youth

Mayor Qian then delivered a speech, stating: Today is the anniversary of the revolutionary martyrs. The central government chose today as Youth Day because most of the martyrs of Huanghuagang who sacrificed themselves for the revolution were youth in their twenties and thirties. Their pure and ardent patriotism can be emulated by today's youth, so this regulation was made. How can we emulate the revolutionary martyrs to complete the great cause of national construction? I believe that first, we must have lofty ideals. The era in which our youth find themselves today is an unprecedented era in five thousand years. The responsibilities that our youth should bear are also unprecedentedly great. The broad road before us is to build a modern country based on the Three Principles of the People. Whether in social construction, political construction, economic construction, ethical construction, or even psychological construction, we need our youth to serve as the backbone and key personnel. Therefore, our youth must have "the ambition to take the world as their own responsibility" and use the spirit of creation and enterprise to complete the mission of revolutionary national construction. After Mayor Qian's speech, Zhan Wenhufu, Li Jilan, and others spoke successively. The chairman then introduced honorary soldier Wang Changxi to the audience, and the entire venue erupted in applause. Then, the swearing-in and establishment ceremony of the first regiment of the China Boy Scouts Shanghai Branch directly affiliated Air Boy Scouts was held, with Qian Dajun administering the oath, and Wu Shaoshu, Cao Jun, Ye Chunnian, Ying Shiwem and Fan Xiaozheng swearing. The ceremony was solemn and grand. After the assembly, the Sports Association held the Youth Day City Youth Cross-Country Race awards ceremony, receiving many banners and prizes, which were awarded by Mayor Qian. A total of ten winners were awarded.

### Britain Launches Textbook Aid to China Movement

[British News Agency, London, March 29th] The entire United Kingdom has launched a movement to aid China with textbooks in specialized subjects. The lack of textbooks has hindered education and technical training in China. During the war, due to a lack of transportation, these textbooks could not be shipped to China. However, the United Kingdom China Relief Fund is now able to arrange tonnage to transport the books to China and distribute them to industrial cooperatives, the Chongqing Women's Guidance Committee, and other relevant organizations. The textbooks requested to be shipped to China include textbooks on cotton spinning, wool spinning, hydraulics, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, leather manufacturing, metallurgy, and industrial chemistry. At the same time, the Chinese Women's Association is also taking steps to ship textbooks needed for wartime relief, such as books on social problems, reports on British social and health practices, career information, hospital relief work, and related subjects.

### Statistics on Schools in This City

The Number of City Schools Increases to More Than 220 Units

[Central News Agency] The Shanghai Education Bureau began receiving municipal schools last September. Initially, only more than 20 schools were received, with 9,800 students and 450 teachers and staff. As of February of this year, the number of municipal schools has increased to more than 220 units, with more than 64,000 students and more than 2,400 teachers and staff. As for private schools, under the guidance of the Education Bureau after the victory, they have also been increasing day by day. There are now more than 1,000 schools, with more than 202,000 students and approximately 17,000 teachers and staff.

### Elementary School Teachers in Hangzhou Demand Higher Salaries

A Concrete Solution Has Been Obtained Starting in March

[Report from our newspaper in Hangzhou] All elementary school teachers in Hangzhou, due to the soaring prices of all goods and the difficulty of life, with an average monthly salary of only 20,000 yuan per person, which is actually less than the income of ordinary laborers, yesterday sent representatives from various schools to the Hangzhou City Education Association in Chenghuangshan City to discuss methods to request a salary increase. After discussion, they decided to request three points, which are recorded as follows: (1) Request the same treatment as provincial civil servants (i.e., 60,000 yuan, 200%). (2) Request to be allocated public grain from the Field Grain Office. (3) Request to join the Provincial Employee Consumer Cooperative to have the right to purchase cheaper allocated goods. After the teachers' representatives meeting, they submitted a request to the Municipal Education Bureau, and Mayor Zhou and Director Hammer respectively met with them and answered that, starting in March, salaries will be issued according to the salary scale standards for provincial civil servants. As for public grain and rice, it has been agreed with the Provincial Field Grain Office to allocate one stone per person per month. 3,000 stones of public grain for the first semester of the 34th year will be distributed equally among municipal government employees, and the municipal government has allocated funds to organize an education cooperative for the benefit of teachers and staff.

### Celebrating the Third Youth Day ‚Äì Grand and Enthusiastic Sports Performances ‚Äì Lou Wenao Wins the Cross-Country Race Championship

Yesterday was the Third Youth Day. In addition to the lively celebrations, the Shanghai Branch of the Youth League held various sports competitions and performances. The weather was clear and the spring breeze was warm. The City Gymnasium was crowded with people from morning to night, reaching an unprecedented scale.

Cross-Country Race

A total of 67 athletes participated in the race, and 61 arrived yesterday, with 6 absentees. At 8:00 AM, the race started from the Youth League branch on Jin Shenfu Road, turned onto Daxing Road and then Yongjia Road. Lou Wenao took the lead, followed by Liu Guangfa, Zhou Ruquan, and Ma Riji. By the time they reached Aitan Road, the rankings had changed very little, except that Zhou Ruquan gradually fell behind. Finally, they entered Shaanxi South Road from Beidang Road and Daxing Road. The mute Lou Wenao finally arrived, reaching the finish line first, taking 34 minutes and 40 seconds. The result was not particularly good, as there were puddles of water along the way, which inevitably had an impact. The top ten winners and the results of the top three are as follows:

(1) Lou Wenao, 34 minutes and 40 seconds, (2) Liu Guangfa, 36 minutes and 26 seconds, (3) Ma Riji, 37 minutes and 55 seconds, (4) Liu Dehong, (5) Liu Zhipeng, (6) Wan Jinsheng, (7) Wang Ji, (8) Shu Zhenyao, (9) Xu Peishun, (10) Wang Jinfu.

Various Performances

The various sports performances began at 2:00 PM in the afternoon. First, the women's youth exercises were neat and lovely, followed by tap dancing, human pyramids, etc., which were all excellent and all performed by young women, making them even more touching and impressive.

Women's Volleyball and Basketball

After the performances, there was women's volleyball. The winter camp team lost to the women's youth B team with a score of 0 to 1. Next was a mixed team against the women's youth A team. The women's youth A team had veteran players such as Zhang Biru and Cheng Hongsheng, and also invited good players such as Li Po, making their momentum quite strong. The mixed team only had eight people to fight, but they fought with few against many. Wang Weizhen and Huang Mingyuan still showed their prowess, taking the lead with a score of 2 to 0, which was truly not easy. Finally, in women's basketball, the 27th team defeated the Jiu V team.

Health Checkup

The health checkup began at 10:00 AM. Yesterday was for the senior high school men's group. Today, starting at 9:00 AM, is for the senior high school men's group, and starting at 2:00 PM in the afternoon is for the Xuanzi senior and junior high schools.

### Lofty Ambitions Reaching for the Clouds: Air Scouts Guiding Youth Skyward

‚Äî Our Reporter Xingwu

Science has expanded the realm of humanity from land and sea to the sky. The vast expanse of space will undoubtedly become our paradise. In World War I, people discovered the importance of the sky and began to utilize it. In World War II, the air force became the main force determining victory. Of course, airplanes were not invented solely for killing. Therefore, you should not imagine Air Scouts as a "small team" solely for aerial combat. Their purpose is: "To guide youth toward the sky."

Due to the introduction through war, Air Scouts first appeared in the United States. In our country, they officially began just yesterday with the first troop of Air Scouts. Their predecessor was the Sino-American Scout Friendship Association. The troop has a total of thirty-three members. Because one person is ill, only thirty-two people participated in the swearing-in and flag-granting ceremony in the gymnasium yesterday. Their second platoon has eleven members, all female students from McTyeire School. The rest are students from schools such as Shanghai University, Datong, St. John's, and Shanghai College. There are also two who are already working in the business world. Each of them has certain duties and cannot be trained all day long, so they only gather once a week. In addition to the three levels of Boy Scout courses, they also emphasize aviation knowledge, such as flight, gliding, and radio.

It is undeniable that our country's air force is still in its infancy and needs to be strengthened in the future. I believe that because of the rapid growth of Air Scouts, the quality of the air force will also greatly improve. At the same time, I hope that the Air Scouts will expand from thirty-three people to thirty thousand, three hundred thousand, or even three million, so that the paradise in the sky of Greater China can be managed and defended by ourselves.

### On the Canal Road

‚Äî Our Correspondent Tao Dian from Zhenjiang, the 25th

The "canal road" I am referring to is not the entire canal from beginning to end, but only a section from Yangzhou to Quanwan Post Office. This section of the canal is one hundred and six li according to Dongli, a small steamboat can make a round trip in a day without rushing. If a car is used, it only takes about five hours to make a round trip. Ordinary boats are at least half a day. It can only complete one-way task, and it also depends on whether the wind is favorable. Now, due to the boundaries of the New Nationalists and Communists, cars are out of the question, and even small steam launches have disappeared. The only means of transportation are postal express boats and some small boats the size of lotus leaves to maintain the transportation of the one hundred and six li section.

A Line of Long Embankment Protecting the Counties Downriver

We should not underestimate this line of long embankment of the canal. It bears the lives and property of the entire Lixiahe area of northern Jiangsu. If it were to collapse, not only would the agricultural products of the counties downriver be wiped out, but humans and animals would also suffer. The breach in the canal embankment in the twentieth year of the Republic of China is the most obvious example. I once went to Xinghua with the China International Famine Relief Commission. The tragic scene of that flood is still vivid in my memory. Only the backyard of the county government and the Confucius Temple had a clean spot of land. The rest was all water. The lowest streets could only see the rooftops. Therefore, when the canal water rises, the people of Xinghua rush to Gaoyou to protect the dam, while the people of Gaoyou, because they do not open the dam, cannot discharge the floodwaters, and if an accident occurs, they will bear the brunt. In order to both open and protect, the officials in charge of the canal are often caught in the middle, finding it difficult to please both sides.

Dredging Equipment Long Gone

During the late Qing dynasty, the canal was highly valued. There was a special fund every year to carry out repairs on time, and a high-ranking official was stationed to be responsible for the work, with clear levels of awards. In peacetime, they were well taken care of. Even a small canal worker was called "Master Canal Worker." However, once a danger occurred, the so-called high-ranking officials always resigned and jumped into the river to apologize to the people. Even in the early Republic of China, important officials were appointed to take charge of the work. In addition to spring repairs and summer defenses, there were also some dredging tools, such as dredgers, traveling along the canal, engaging in dredging work, fearing that the riverbed would be silted up with mud, the river channel would be narrowed, and the capacity would be reduced. But now, not only is there no spring repair or summer defense to speak of, but even those tools are nowhere to be found. Therefore, the current canal is full of dangers, especially in the Gaoyou area. And the most collapses in the canal have historically occurred in Gaoyou, which is due to the presence of Gaoyou Lake. When the water is low, there is no problem at all, but if a year of heavy flooding comes, the degree of danger is unimaginable.

Embankment Body Repeatedly Damaged in Recent Years

In the early days of the War of Resistance, fearing that the Japanese army would invade Gaoyou from the canal embankment, the section of the river embankment from Shaobo to Huaiyin was broken section by section, dug into ditches. After the fall, during the period of the puppet regime, no one cared about it. Now, it is even more scarred and dilapidated. Moreover, some people have predicted that there may be floods this year. People in Jiangsu Province are planning to discuss a solution with the Relief Administration to make preparations for spring repairs. However, this long line is completely under the control of the Communist army, so they invited members of parliament Leng Yuqiu, and others to inspect the canal area to begin work. As a result, it is said that they returned without any results. With this trend, they can only let it run its course. However, the people of northern Jiangsu have been exhausted during these eight years of the War of Resistance. If they unfortunately encounter floods again, will Heaven not be trying to destroy the people of northern Jiangsu?

Shaobo Town Becomes a Three-Way Free Zone

This is a famous town on the canal line. Now, except for Yangzhou, which is in the Nationalist army's area, the rest are under the control of the Communist army. Shaobo is a more special town. Although it is nominally under the Communist army, the area south of Shaobo is again under the Nationalist army. The people in this town are quite convenient, especially in terms of money. Anti-Japanese currency, legal tender, customs gold units, and even puppet currency are not subject to major restrictions, and profits can even be made from them. People going to the south of the Yangtze River have to exchange anti-Japanese currency for legal tender in Shaobo. Otherwise, it is not only worthless, but may even be a crime. People who enter the northern areas that have been penetrated and investigated are required to exchange "Wei" currency through the police in order to be considered "Jian" [frugal]. If they do not exchange it, once it is discovered, it will either be confiscated in full or torn up. The exchange rate, in addition to the regulations, is subject to some unstandardized ups and downs. Some people have estimated that if 10,000 legal tender is exchanged back and forth five times, it can be turned into nothing.

The Chu-Han Border Makes Things Difficult for the Common People

Three or five li away from Yangzhou, there are traces of the Communist army. The most obvious thing can be seen from the slogans. And on the road this time, a driver slowly said to me, "Sir, this is the area of the New Fourth Army."

I listened and looked around. The earth was very quiet, and I couldn't see any traces. I didn't believe that the terrain was divided so clearly. After a while, he slowly said to me again, "Sir, this is the area of the Nationalist army." The reporter also looked around. The earth was very quiet, and I couldn't find any traces. I only have one thought: whether it is the area of the New Fourth Army or the area of the Nationalist army, it is still Chinese land. Why do Chinese people have to divide it like this Chu-Han border? Because of this Chu-Han border, it has made the common people suffer extremely. Chinese people walking on Chinese roads have to be careful when walking and careful when speaking. A little carelessness is fraught with danger. What crime have the common people committed?

Two Appeals: Hope for an Early Resolution

In the declaration of the Second Plenary Session, regarding the restoration of transportation, it was specifically pointed out that "If transportation cannot be restored, the people cannot travel freely, goods cannot circulate smoothly, and everything else cannot be discussed." This is indeed a most serious problem. Therefore, regarding this point, we hope that both the Nationalists and the Communists will prioritize the livelihood of the people and no longer drive the common people to a dead end. Second, there is the problem of currency. The influence of puppet currency during the eight years of the War of Resistance has already exhausted the people. Now that we have won victory, the people should be allowed to catch their breath, and there should be no more obstacles between anti-Japanese currency and legal tender. Economic freeze has occurred. The difficulty of anti-Japanese currency is even greater than that of puppet currency because it cannot circulate in all directions. Since both the Nationalists and the Communists seem to prioritize the people, they should resolve these two pains as soon as possible and make an appropriate solution. This is truly serving the people.

### Ancestor of the Atom

‚Äî Translated by Our Editorial Department

The theory of the atom did not begin today; it was discovered more than two thousand years ago by the ancient Greek thinker Democritus, known as the "Laughing Philosopher." He had already determined that the secrets of the universe were hidden inside the infinitely small particles. However, it was not until our time that this theory became a major scientific discovery.

Democritus was born in the city of Abdera in Thrace (in present-day Greece and European Turkey), near the Black Sea and the Aegean Sea. The residents of the city were known for their ignorance and stupidity. His father had secretly colluded with the Persian King Xerxes, who, to express his gratitude, sent him many exquisite gifts, including several magicians from the ancient Asian kingdom of Chaldea, that is, "sages of the East." The young Democritus studied with these sages. After his father died, he sold his inheritance and set off to travel around and study.

Returning Home Weary, Engaged in Lecturing

He visited the monks and sorcerers of Egypt, the prophets of Ethiopia, the astrologers of Persia, and the clairvoyant ascetics of India. He pondered and explored the origin of matter. He meticulously observed nature and finally developed a materialistic view that was almost the same as modern thought. After many years, he "returned home weary" to his hometown of Abdera, spending his life as a teacher and lecturer.

Every time he appeared in public places, he always laughed coldly and relentlessly at the stupidity of the world, thus earning the nickname "Laughing Philosopher." There were so many things to laugh at in Abdera that he refused to leave there until his death. His weather forecasts and predictions of political changes were often accurate, greatly surprising his fellow countrymen and treating him as a god. He was not only the ancestor of the atomic theory but also the creator of the calendar.

In the Naples Museum in Italy, there is a plaster bust of Democritus - full of beard, with a mocking expression. This ancient philosopher became famous for ridiculing the world and joking about life. However, the modern world suddenly discovered that the atom he first discovered was no longer a laughing matter.

Infinite Possibilities for Development

The use of atomic energy is still in its infancy, and its future development possibilities are unlimited. Einstein once explained that matter is merely condensed energy and that one type of matter can theoretically be changed into another. From his simple equation, it is calculated that if the atoms contained in one pound of soil were destroyed, it could produce one million horsepower for ten thousand hours, enough to supply New York's electricity needs for a year.

It will probably take many years before engineers can figure out how to replace coal or oil with U-235. If that level of industrialization can be achieved, power plants will certainly be very different from what they are now. At that time, steam will be generated by the heat of atomic energy.

We imagine a piece of uranium the size of a walnut containing the potential energy equivalent to 1,250 pounds of high-quality coal. If it can be utilized, it is truly an incredible miracle.

### Sketch of Ambassador Wellington Koo

Ambassador Koo was nine and a half days late for the Second Plenary Session. He arrived at the meeting on the afternoon of the 10th, and was assigned seat number one. The seating chart originally had Yang Ai Yuan written on it, but it was temporarily changed to Ambassador Koo's seat.

That afternoon, he became the focus of attention. He was wearing a black woolen suit with thin white stripes. His already silvery white hair was parted on the right and thinly plastered on his head. His face was full but not plump. On his nose, he wore a pair of white gold glasses with black frames. He had a short, white mustache. He gave the impression of being dignified and noble, without the flashy and arrogant pretension of a typical diplomat.

Ambassador Koo's "lateness" was mentioned in Minister Xu Kan's report on food at the Second Plenary Session, because he was negotiating with the British side to allow the opening of Southeast Asian rice-producing areas to export food to China. Because he was "late," he did not hear the most important foreign affairs report review session at the Plenary Session. Therefore, he attended both the Political Consultative Conference and the Foreign Affairs General Assembly in the People's Political Council in the observer seats. He sat between Secretary-General Wu Tiegcheng and Vice Minister Zhu Jingnong. Mr. Wu constantly spoke with him in low voices in English. The Political Consultative Conference was a new event in domestic politics after the victory, and Ambassador Koo paid close attention to it. During the afternoon's foreign affairs report and inquiry, many speakers directed their remarks to Ambassador Koo, because everyone mentioned the United Nations General Assembly! Mentioned diplomatic style, etc., are closely related to Ambassador Koo.

From the perspective of a news reporter, he is a news figure that should not be missed. However, in the Second Plenary Session and the People's Political Council, because time was short, there was no opportunity to have a long conversation with Ambassador Koo. On the day of the Political Consultative Conference report in the People's Political Council, using the ten-minute break, I only made a short conversation. The reporter asked him how long he planned to stay in the country this time? Whether to go elsewhere? He said he planned to stay for a month and planned to visit the Pingjin area, but did not talk about the main issue. Chairman Wu Yifang on the stage had already announced from the amplifier "Continue the meeting." The reporter asked Ambassador Koo to sign his name as a souvenir for the newspaper and hastily ended the interview.

Ambassador Koo is a highly respected diplomat internationally, and the impression he gives is also approachable, without the arrogant and pretentious attitude of ordinary diplomatic personnel.

### Closing Remarks

‚Äî Yuan Shu

The exhibition has closed, and as we look back on the achievements of the past few days, we feel endless gratitude.

First of all, we should thank the nearly one hundred thousand visitors. For the sake of cherishing the current meager gains of Chinese industry, and for the desire to seek new scientific knowledge, they eagerly came to visit. We deeply apologize that we could not avoid subjecting them to many restrictions due to our painstaking efforts to maintain order. We are also deeply grateful that they are willing to donate to our technical education assistance fund in order to enrich the content of Chinese technical education, so that our Chinese technical vocational night school has no worries about expenses.

Secondly, we must thank the cooperation of the manufacturers. Each factory has spent a lot of money on preparing and arranging the exhibits, and agreed with our purpose, willing to strengthen the educational significance in the content of the exhibition, and pay special attention to explaining the production process and principles, so that the audience can easily understand, and adapt to the needs of the current stage of industrialization, which is also something we can all celebrate.

The goodwill of the media is also worth mentioning. Every newspaper and every reporter has given the greatest tolerance to our shortcomings, and the greatest hope to any small achievement. This is entirely for China, for Chinese industry, and because Chinese industry needs encouragement and cultivation. This kind of media enthusiasm is something that we technicians and everyone who is determined to develop the national industry feel excited about.

We would also like to thank every staff member during the exhibition, including the representatives sent by various manufacturers to serve at the exhibition. The members of the Technical Association are of course the organizers and those responsible for the preparation of the exhibition. Many friends who are not members were invited to assist and purely volunteered to take on various specialized tasks. I believe this is also because they have a passion for promoting industrial construction. We especially regret that we did not receive the manufacturers well enough, who tirelessly and spared no effort to take care of the exhibition and explain it to the audience.

However, everyone can be pleased that a new and promising vision of industry has been unfolded before the people of the whole country through the opportunity of the Shanghai Industrial Products Exhibition. We believe in each other that as long as we do not feel difficulty, we can continue to hold industrial product exhibitions year after year, then this vision will surely be brought closer day by day.

Goodbye, to every gentleman and lady who cares about and is responsible for China's new industry. The road is not difficult to walk, but it must be taken step by step.

### Technical Personnel and Technical Construction

‚Äî Fang Ai

There are two directions for promoting technical education. On the one hand, it is to promote technical education universally, so that every citizen pays attention to industrial issues and creates a social atmosphere of learning engineering, gaining the minimum level of industrial knowledge. On the other hand, it is to deeply cultivate a group of hard-working and pragmatic technical personnel who are consciously willing to work hard for the construction of a new China. The result of creating a social atmosphere of learning engineering is that it can encourage many young people to embark on the road of hard work and pragmatism. The purpose of the Shanghai Industrial Products Exhibition hosted by the Chinese Technical Association is to create this social atmosphere. The industrial lectures and technical night schools held in the past were to cultivate a group of technical personnel for industrial nation-building.

The content of the Shanghai Industrial Products Exhibition may seem too dry to some audiences who are not familiar with engineering issues, and it must seem ordinary to some audiences who are specializing in engineering research. However, it is undeniable that if you can spend an hour or two carefully listening to the explanations of each exhibition department, they will tell you how much painstaking history of improvement and research. Technical personnel, in the eyes of people who do not engage in engineering, are craftsmen, and in the eyes of some academic experts, are narrow-minded. However, they do not know that our daily lives cannot but rely on the efforts of these pragmatic technical personnel. Every industrial product has been constantly improved by them, so that people's enjoyment has reached its current state. Everyone knows the principles of the atomic bomb, and what is being debated is only a technical issue.

The improvement of technology is not a difficult task. The question is whether we have this spirit of hard work, and whether the strong members of society attach importance to this issue. The former is what the Chinese Technical Association needs to work harder on, and the latter is what we hope all sectors of society will assist in.

The past and future of this association has been clearly presented to all sectors through this exhibition. We hope that the gentlemen who love this association will give us corrections and assistance.

### Our Voice

‚Äî Shi Yue

The Shanghai Industrial Products Exhibition has been open for six days, and the crowds are the largest seen in the past eight years, which is truly unexpected. In this way, China's industrialization is not without hope.

We ask ourselves that we are a late-rising group, so we humbly seek criticism anytime and anywhere, but the only regret is that we only hear words of praise, which reduces our opportunities to correct our mistakes.

Here it is! I happened to hear two negative criticisms in a private conversation: One said: "This kind of exhibition would have been more meaningful if it had been held fifty years ago." I said to him: "We are precisely because China's industry has been devastated by the enemy and puppets, and then suffered setbacks after victory. In a situation of regression, it is not as prosperous as it was fifty years ago. Therefore, we want to use an exhibition like the one fifty years ago to revive the vitality of Chinese industry." Another said: "This kind of exhibition, held in a cosmopolitan commercial port open to Chinese and foreign observers, seems to be embarrassing and may be laughed at by others." "That's right," I said, "it is an undeniable fact that Chinese industry is backward, but is it a fundamental solution to avoid treatment because of fear of disease? Is this the attitude that people in the technical circle should take? Not being afraid of embarrassment and ridicule is precisely the courage of the organizers and participants of this industrial exhibition. The problem is not whether there is a problem, but whether we can catch up quickly after being laughed at. I can guarantee that 'Zhong Ji' [Chinese Technical Association] and all the manufacturers in the venue definitely have this courage. 'Knowing shame' is originally 'close to courage'!" If this naive "industrial exhibition" has done its best to promote China's industrialization and promote Chinese industry, then it has completed its mission. As for the truly practical work of "Zhong Ji", it is not just a mere exhibition, otherwise, it would be enough to show off at the exhibition, why bother to raise funds again?

Therefore, the "industrial exhibition" is merely our voice.

### "Industry Exposition" Reflections

‚Äî Shi Wen

Now no one doubts, no one hesitates; on the contrary, replacing the past fears and gloom is excitement and interest. Many of the staff members expressed this same feeling in their "Workers' Words." Who is not inspired by this enthusiastic scene! Who is not happy for this enthusiastic scene!

The staff's lofty, selfless spirit was fully manifested in this exhibition. They sacrificed sleep, sacrificed their professions, or schoolwork, and some even sacrificed their health in the end. Why such enthusiasm, such dedication to working hard for the exhibition? It was not for fame, nor for profit, but a response to the motherland's call. They felt there was a need to hold an industrial exhibition as a call for national industrialization.

It was this feeling that connected them, as close as a family, each guarding their post. For a week, they strained their voices and stood until their legs ached, without complaint or regret, always enthusiastically accepting the day's tasks. In this instance, we once again realized the value of "harmony among people," and we firmly believe that any difficult and arduous task, as long as the group is united, can be overcome. Don't believe it? I tell you, the exhibition was indeed supported by this spirit.

Secondly, the holding of the exhibition has undeniably changed the entire situation. At the beginning of preparations, everyone was unfamiliar with the China Technical Association, and even many who cared about us were worried about this time. Thanks to the manufacturers, academic circles, industrial circles, the press, and the student community, the exhibition was able to close successfully today. However, the responsibility of the Technical Association has increased as a result. Because it has transformed from a liaison organization into a national organization. In other words, its status has been elevated in this event.

Holding an industrial product exhibition is just an attempt today, so many aspects seem insufficiently substantial. However, we feel that if we want to improve the academic content today, it is not suitable for a single level of expertise. Only the mix of commodities and industry attracts a large audience. We hope that in the future, according to the national construction process, we can gradually increase the content and broaden the scope.

### Culture and Industry

‚Äî Ning Fu

To promote culture, I feel that improving the cultural level is inseparable from industrial progress. If you only have the mind of a cultural person, or engage in other artistic fields, but lack the necessary tools, what can you rely on to develop and carry it forward?

Examples are easy to find. For example, to write an article, you need a smooth-flowing pen. Where does that pen come from? When your academic thoughts are written down, you need "Alarm Bell" brand paper and copperplate to print and distribute them to people to read and learn. But old duplicators are too clumsy, so you have to switch to the "Daming" mimeograph machine, which is very fast and clear, so that your work can be widely disseminated. Or, if it is a book, to preserve the plates when reprinting, you also need "Great Light Industry Factory" produced "Brand" proof paper to make paper plates for permanent use.

Therefore, if you are a cultural person, you still have to rely on industry; advanced industry to help your work, in order to complete your mission of promoting culture with half the effort and twice the result.

### Worker's Words

Outside, it is raining heavily, and in some places the roads are flooded by inches, but the guests attending have not decreased because of this. They are so attentively observing the manufacturing process, the machinery, the applications, and everything on display. This shows that there is no force that can stop people's love of truth and desire for knowledge. As a worker, he feels that the past efforts have not been without reward. At the same time, he believes that as long as it is for the progress and happiness of mankind, all efforts will be rewarded accordingly. For the more difficult work in the future, we have indeed gained no small encouragement and more courage here. ‚ÄîWang Minxi

"We hope that the content of the exhibition is academic and has educational significance, so that the audience can gain industrial knowledge and arouse public attention to industry." These were the words used in the association's business department's circular to manufacturers soliciting participation.

"If the factory's layout focuses too much on advertising, it will lose the meaning of the exhibition. Looking at the registration form is really worrying. Most of them are only writing about the exhibits. If it becomes a department store, it will be terrible." All of our staff members were worried about this.

"We will mobilize public friends to contact familiar manufacturers, persuade and help them design."

"Our association will also mobilize members to design electrical knowledge and mechanical knowledge to enrich the content of the exhibition." This was our meeting resolution.

Although our attitude towards work has remained the same from the beginning of preparations to the closing of the exhibition, since the staff members do not have rich experience in organizing exhibitions, they have been extremely cautious in handling the preparatory work. Finally, on March 24th, the opening date arrived, and seeing that most of the exhibition results provided by the manufacturers were accompanied by descriptions of the production process, charts, and cross-sections of the machine's physical objects, the mood of our staff gradually relaxed at this time. We deeply admire the cooperation between the factory and our association. This is also the first cooperation between the industrial circles and technical personnel. We hope that it is also a symbol of permanent cooperation. ‚ÄîWu Zhongyi

Mr. Yao Yuyi, a famous industrialist, visited us yesterday at the invitation of our association. He gave deep encouragement to the work done by the Technical Association and generously donated a large sum of money for the expenses of the Technical Association. Mr. Yao also promised to help with the issue of the location of the Technical Association's clubhouse and night school, which the Technical Association currently feels is difficult. This gift to technical personnel and China's technological construction, benefiting society, is something that all members of the "Technical Association" should be grateful for.

The members of the China Technical Association include departments such as chemical engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, civil engineering, textile engineering, mining and metallurgy, agriculture, commerce, mathematics, and physics, and are divided into full members, basic members, junior members, and supporting members. Scientists, engineers, technicians of all levels, and technical college students are warmly welcomed to join as members. The constitution and past history are explained in detail in the special publication of the Shanghai Industrial Products Exhibition. For individual requests for the constitution, applications for membership, or other matters, please send a letter to the China Technical Association, c/o China Science Society, 533 South Shaanxi Road, Shanghai.

Historical Materials

### Declaration of the Establishment of the China Technical Association

The China Technical Association was established through the reorganization of the Soviet Friendship Association, and its history has been one year and six months. The past undertakings of this organization, such as industrial (lectures, engineering magazines, China Technical College Night School), have already gained social attention. Since the opening of the Shanghai Industrial Products Exhibition, it has aroused the concern of the Chinese people. The founding declaration of the association is attached below, and it is hoped that friends of the Technical Association will generously provide guidance.

The China Technical Association was officially established in Shanghai on March 17, 1946. We would like to take this opportunity to express our thoughts and wishes to the people of the country.

"Everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the world." Everyone has a due obligation to the country. Moreover, "the world belongs to everyone," the country is owned by the people, and everyone has the right to be respected. China has suffered from war for a long time. Looking at our rivers and mountains, what we see and hear is devastation everywhere and the suffering of the people. Every conscientious and passionate Chinese person cannot help but be moved and feel the heavy burden on their shoulders. The members of this association are all technical personnel. In China, where there are many illiterates and the people are weak, we are very fortunate to have received the baptism of new education and new science. Each of us has a unique skill. At this time of recovery and reconstruction, we consider the needs of the country and the demands of the people, and dare not underestimate ourselves. We deeply realize that we should use new technologies to serve the new China and build the new China. This is our unshirkable responsibility.

Therefore, we have organized ourselves. We have raised the banner of the China Technical Association to call on, encourage, and gather technical personnel from all over the country to participate in this once-in-a-lifetime undertaking of national construction for our beloved motherland. The work of national construction has countless aspects, and the directions we should strive for are to promote construction on the one hand and to cultivate talents on the other. In order to promote construction, we want every technical person to join the flood of national construction, each contributing his skills to promote the construction work in various departments. We advocate cultivating talents, hoping that the country can have a constant stream of technical young army to inherit and carry forward the established construction foundations. Only through continuous training, continuous mobilization, consistent participation, and consistent efforts, without wasting a minute or a second of time, and without wasting a drop of blood or sweat of manpower, can our national construction work be completed as soon as possible, and then our compatriots who are closely related can be freed from suffering as soon as possible and achieve well-being.

Of course, we cannot ignore reality. Half a year has passed since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, and we deeply doubt whether we have reaped the fruits of victory. In fact, we are heartbroken by the downfall of national industry, indignant at the gathering of bureaucratic capital, and anxious about the slow recovery, the farmers' inability to return to their fields, and the workers being excluded from factory gates. We also sigh at the vagueness of the economic construction plan, but it is useless to be heartbroken, indignant, anxious, and sighing. If you don't break through the clouds, you can't see the moonlight; if you don't remove the thorns, you can't pave a smooth road. Everyone is the master of China, and revitalizing China is an obligation and a right. For the sake of the country and the people, we should do our best to eliminate unreasonable phenomena and put the locomotive of national construction on track. We want to assist kind national industrialists in rebuilding their businesses, and we want to urge and support the legitimate and sound use of state capital. We are also concerned about the return of farmers to their homes, the return of workers to factories, the smooth flow of transportation, the decline in prices, and the realization of a huge and solid national economic construction plan.

If the current obstacles cannot be overcome, then we cannot participate in or promote construction, and the cultivation of talents will be in vain.

Today, we technical personnel clearly recognize that participating in the construction of a new China is not a career, but a hope, a truth. We must hold the spirit of martyrs and dedicate our knowledge, skills, and strength to realize a prosperous and happy new China. We should always think for the best and imitate the best, but we should not ignore difficulties and obstacles. We are all technical personnel, we all have patriotic loyalty, and we all have ideals to present to the good. In order to carry out our loyalty and realize our ideals, we believe that it is meaningful to come together. From now on, we will focus on service externally and focus on unity internally. We want to become a sound and pure group of technical personnel, friendly and harmonious, helping and encouraging each other, cultivating sincere friendship, seeking each other's welfare, and building a common cause.

During difficult times, Chinese technical personnel have shown excellent results, and we believe that future national construction work will definitely be smooth, and the contribution of technical personnel will definitely be even more impressive. However, technical personnel are only one part of national construction, so we also need assistance and cooperation from all aspects. We sincerely ask for the enthusiastic support and love from all levels of society across the country.

The new China needs new technical personnel. The new technical personnel must be selfless, non-blindly follow, non-complacent, and non-speculative; they must have ideals, breadth of mind, perseverance, and integrity. The China Technical Association will promote this style from now on. Only in this style can the power of national construction be maximized and the great cause of national construction be completed as soon as possible. However, we will never exaggerate, we only firmly believe that: if you have a point of maturity, give off a point of light, and the more fuel, the stronger the power. Therefore, on this warm and clear day, we dare to appeal to the people of the country: for the sake of China and for the sake of our compatriots, please extend your hands of sympathy and mutual assistance!

On the occasion of the establishment, this declaration is made.
