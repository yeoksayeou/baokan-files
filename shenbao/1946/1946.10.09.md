### Ma Marshall Issues Public Statement: The Chinese Communists Reject the Cessation of Hostilities at Zhangjiakou, and Peaceful Negotiations Face Another Setback

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] Premier of the Executive Yuan, Mr. Song, issued the following statement at 8:00 PM on the 8th: After months of stalemate in negotiations between the government and the Chinese Communists, two suggestions were successively put forward in an attempt to break the deadlock: (1) Ambassador Stuart suggested forming an informal five-person group to discuss the reorganization of the National Government to allow the participation of the Chinese Communists, but the Chinese Communists rejected it; (2) The government then proposed, in addition to convening the five-person group, also convening a three-person conference to discuss the issue of army reorganization, with the aim of quickly stopping military conflicts. The Chinese Communists did not respond to this proposal. On October 8th, General Ma informed the representatives of the Chinese Communists that Chairman Chiang was willing to halt the advance toward Zhangjiakou for a period of ten days, during which the two key issues of political and military reorganization would be discussed. The Chinese Communists have now rejected this new suggestion, which is deeply regrettable. However, the government still hopes to continue negotiations to seek a peaceful resolution to the Chinese Communist issue.

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 8th] Following the public statement issued by Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart on the afternoon of the 8th, our newspaper's reporter paid a special visit to Ambassador Stuart at 7:00 PM to request a statement from him in his role as a mediator. He graciously received the reporter and stated briefly that the purpose of issuing the public statement was to make the entire Chinese people aware of the content of the peace talks. General Marshall and he had not added any personal opinions but wanted to leave room for readers to make their own judgments. Regarding the progress of the peace talks, the Ambassador provided a detailed analysis of the mediation efforts since the beginning of the month, believing that the government side was sincerely seeking peace and hoping for a ceasefire. He stated that initially everyone acknowledged cooperation, and they believed that if the reorganization of the National Government Committee could be established, all problems could be resolved step by step. For example, regarding the issue of the military mediation department’s executive team entering the area within the ten-day ceasefire period proposed by the government, the Chinese Communists feared that government personnel would be active everywhere. They were willing to take responsibility for it. The government was earnestly hoping for a ceasefire, but now there has been another change. As for the ceasefire guarantee demanded by the Chinese Communists, General Marshall and he declared that they would do their best to guarantee it. Their hopes were high because they knew that the government wanted a ceasefire and also wanted a democratic government, as did the Chinese Communists. However, such negotiations must not be approached with excessive suspicion, lest they lead to a tragic outcome. Finally, the Ambassador solemnly told the reporter that if there was any possibility of saving the situation, they would still do their best and were still awaiting a response from the Communist Party. The Ambassador's tone was somber today. Although the reporter was in a luxurious living room, he could not help but feel as if he were facing an abyss. The Ambassador ultimately did not deny the seriousness of the current situation but believed that if there was any room for maneuver, he would still do his best. After the reporter shook hands with him to say goodbye, they went directly to General Marshall's residence to celebrate Mrs. Marshall's birthday.

Text of Marshall-Stuart Statement

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] General Marshall and Ambassador Stuart issued a public statement on the 8th, the text of which is as follows: "On the morning of October 1st, General Marshall received a memorandum dated September 30th from Zhou Enlai in Shanghai via Communist representative Wang Bingnan, outlining various activities of the Kuomintang. It concluded by saying: 'I am now instructed to inform you of the following facts and request that you convey them to the government side: If the Kuomintang government does not cease its military operations against Zhangjiakou and its vicinity, the Chinese Communists will be forced to assume that the government has publicly declared a complete rupture and finally abandoned its declared policy of peaceful resolution. The responsibility for all serious consequences arising from this state of affairs shall naturally be borne entirely by the government side.'"

"At General Zhou Enlai's request, the aforementioned memorandum was forwarded to Chairman Chiang. On October 2nd, the Chairman replied to General Marshall with a memorandum citing certain hostile actions by Communist troops. In this memorandum, the Chairman suggested that, in order to save time and demonstrate the government's sincerity, the government would make the following maximum concessions to resolve the current issues:"

"(1) The Chinese Communists have repeatedly urged the reorganization of the National Government, and the key to the reorganization is the allocation of seats. The government originally agreed to 8 seats for the Chinese Communists and 4 seats for the Democratic League, totaling 12 seats, within the National Government Committee. The Chinese Communists demanded 10 seats for the Chinese Communists and 4 seats for the Democratic League, totaling 14 seats. The government now makes a compromise concession of 8 seats for the Chinese Communists, 4 seats for the Democratic League, and 1 seat from the non-party seats, recommended by the Chinese Communists, totaling 13 seats with government agreement. The Chinese Communists should immediately submit the list of Chinese Communist members of the National Government Committee and the list of their representatives to the National Assembly. However, this agreement should be negotiated by the informal five-person group and then submitted to the Comprehensive Group for agreement."

"(2) In order to effectively implement the army reorganization plan, the garrison locations of the Chinese Communist's 18 divisions should be quickly determined, and they should enter the garrison locations in accordance with the prescribed time limit. This decision should be formally agreed upon by the three-person conference and then submitted to the Military Mediation Executive Department for supervision and implementation."

"If the Chinese Communists are truly sincere in peaceful cooperation and willing to quickly resolve these two issues, then both sides should immediately announce the cessation of military operations upon reaching an agreement."

"This notification was immediately conveyed to the Communist representatives, and the Communist representatives visited the American mediators within the same week, requesting clarification as to whether the Committee Chairman's memorandum of October 2nd was a response to Zhou Enlai's memorandum of September 30th, as it did not mention Zhangjiakou."

"Subsequently, the Committee Chairman, General Marshall, and Ambassador Stuart held several discussions. As a result, the Committee Chairman agreed to order a halt to the advance towards Zhangjiakou for ten days. During these ten days, the five-person group and the three-person group would hold meetings to consider the two suggestions made by the Committee Chairman on October 2nd. The Committee Chairman also agreed that, during this truce period, the Executive Headquarters would convene an executive team at various key points to investigate whether the truce agreement was being observed. However, within the Communist army's front lines, government representatives would not accompany the executive team. Executive teams would also be stationed between the Kuomintang and Communist armies, with representatives from both sides participating. In addition, the American representatives would have the right to decide where and when the executive team would proceed, and the representative himself would report any actions that he believed violated the truce agreement. The Committee Chairman also agreed that the truce communiqué would be issued by the American mediators, and both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party would avoid issuing any communiqués."

"This news was delivered to Communist representative Wang Bingnan on October 6th at 1:30 PM, to be forwarded to General Zhou Enlai in Shanghai."

"Today (Tuesday, October 8th), Mr. Wang Bingnan verbally conveyed the response from Zhou Enlai in Yan'an, the content of which is as follows:"

"(1) The truce should be indefinite, as experience has shown that nothing else will be satisfactory. Unless our government demonstrates its sincerity and withdraws its troops to their original positions, the above suggestion seems to be merely a strategic ploy."

"(2) The Communist Party is very eager for the three-person and five-person groups to convene meetings, but the scope of discussion should not be limited to the two paragraphs in the Committee Chairman's memorandum of October 2nd. The topics involved in the ceasefire state can be considered as being under military duress."

"(3) There was no response to the memorandum of October 2nd because the Communist Party was very eager for General Marshall and Ambassador Stuart to clarify the situation for achieving peace."

"The recent suggestion shows that the situation has not changed significantly. Therefore, General Zhou is prepared to submit a written reply and believes that there is no need to return to Nanjing for the time being."

### The Government Hopes Zhou Enlai Will Return to Nanjing to Participate in Negotiations; Liang Shuming Expresses Astonishment at the Communist Party's Response

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 8th] The Communist Party's response, which had been awaited by all parties in recent days, was delivered from Yan'an to Zhou Enlai in Shanghai last night, and Wang Bingnan visited Ambassador Stuart at 11:00 AM on the 8th to verbally inform him of their opinions. After Wang left, the Ambassador immediately visited Special Envoy Marshall to discuss the matter and inform him of everything. His personal advisor, Fu Jingbo, also visited Premier Song around 12:00 PM. In the afternoon, the Ambassador again invited Dong Biwu and Wang Bingnan to meet and review the morning's discussions. After reading the evening newspapers from 5:00 PM, people in Nanjing, having learned of the Communist Party's attitude towards the government, spread the fear that a rupture was imminent. Subsequently, the American Embassy issued another public statement from Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart, and the political atmosphere shifted from yesterday's hopes to a pervasive mood of pessimism. The reporter then visited government officials Shao Lizi and Zhang Lisheng, who both stated that they still hoped Zhou Enlai would return to Nanjing to reopen negotiations and unanimously believed that the fairness and sincerity of the two mediators, Marshall and Stuart, were deeply commendable. Liang Shuming of the Democratic League stated that he had no prior knowledge and expressed astonishment at the Communist Party's response. He said that he would visit Dong Biwu this evening to inquire about the matter. A spokesperson for the Communist Party delegation offered the following explanation to the reporter: 1. They had no prior knowledge of the American statement before it was published. Dong Biwu had not learned of it when he went to the Embassy in the afternoon, and only found out after it was published. 2. One aspect of the statement did not conform to the original suggestion, namely that the government specifically stated that the Communist Party should "implement" the two points mentioned in the government's memorandum of October 2nd within the ten-day ceasefire period, while the statement said "consider." Also, regarding the issue of troops returning to their original defenses, it referred to the withdrawal of the troops attacking Zhangjiakou, not the withdrawal of all troops. The reporter inquired about his opinion on this public statement, and the spokesperson said that Zhou Enlai would issue a formal statement, which was currently being drafted, and once drafted, it would express the Communist Party's attitude.

### The Chinese Communists Repeatedly Break Faith; Marshall and Stuart Raise Questions

[United Press, Nanjing, 8th] Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart summoned the Communist Party representative Dong Biwu to a meeting at the American Embassy at 4:00 PM this afternoon to determine the Communist Party's views on the new compromise proposal. This move by the two envoys seemed to be a last-minute effort to salvage the deteriorating peace talks. Mr. Dong reiterated the Communist Party's attitude to the two envoys, stating that the Communist Party regarded an unconditional and comprehensive ceasefire as a prerequisite for resuming peace talks. Marshall asked why the Communist Party was refusing to participate, given that it had once said that if the government stopped attacking Zhangjiakou, the Communist Party would participate in the five-person conference. Mr. Dong replied that the Communist Party had never made such an announcement because the government and the American mediators had not guaranteed that the government would cease military operations if the conference proceeded. The two envoys then said that since the government had agreed to stop attacking Zhangjiakou, they did not understand why the Communist Party was making new demands on the government. Mr. Dong replied that if the government troops were still within fifteen miles of Zhangjiakou, the Communist Party could not consider the city's danger to have been removed. Mr. Dong also made a counter-proposal, advocating that the National Army withdraw to its original positions before September 1st. At the same time, the Communist Party delegation here is carefully studying the Marshall-Stuart statement. A Communist Party spokesperson said that the statement quoted Zhou Enlai's reply with many inaccuracies, such as the last sentence, which said that Zhou "...believes that it is unnecessary to return to Nanjing," which was surprising because Wang Bingnan had removed this sentence when conveying the reply.

### Zhou Enlai Leaves Nanjing for Shanghai, Definitely Entrusted with a Major Mission

Evading Negotiations and Commanding the Chinese Communists

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] At this time when peace hangs by a thread, all parties are paying close attention to the actions of the Communist Party representative Zhou Enlai. Some non-partisan figures hope that Mr. Zhou will return to Nanjing from Shanghai on the 20th to break the deadlock. According to an observer here, Mr. Zhou Enlai's trip to Shanghai seems to be an action based on a pre-determined plan, aimed at evading negotiations, because Mr. Zhou is well aware that after Chairman Chiang returns to Nanjing from Jiangxi, the government will invite Mr. Zhou to resume negotiations. It was also learned from well-informed sources that the Communist Party claimed that Mr. Zhou's mission to Shanghai was to negotiate the investigation into the ban on the "Masses Weekly," but this was merely a smokescreen. His real mission was to urge the key leaders of the Democratic League to restore unity, under the instigation and exploitation of the Chinese Communists, in order to cope with the upcoming National Assembly. Since February, Zhang Lan, ill in Chengdu, and Luo Longji have had a dispute over neutrality and non-neutrality. Huang Yanpei has shown no expression other than focusing on his educational career. Shen Junru is also quite silent and lacks activity. Liang Shuming intends to resign as Secretary-General of the Democratic League. Mr. Zhou Enlai is extremely concerned about this situation. The meeting of the key leaders of the Democratic League in Shanghai happened to coincide with Mr. Zhou Enlai's arrival in Shanghai, and the relationship between them cannot be said to be accidental. Moreover, after arriving in Shanghai, Mr. Zhou told a reporter from the United Press that he had withdrawn from the negotiations and would not return to Nanjing unless Chairman Chiang agreed to convene a military three-person group meeting. However, when the three-person group and five-person group were about to be held at the same time, the Chinese Communists raised conditions to obstruct them. This further proves that his trip to Shanghai was not only to promote the unity of the Democratic League but also had other intentions. Therefore, it is certain that Mr. Zhou's trip to Shanghai is related to the following points:

(1) Discussing the deployment of new special agents sent to Shanghai with key personnel such as the liaison minister of the Central Military Region.

(2) Urging the overt personnel in Nanjing and Shanghai to end their external activities, concentrate in Shanghai to prepare for evacuation, and have specialized personnel draft an evacuation plan.

(3) Inciting pro-Communist elements to form a so-called "Committee to Substantially Aid the Chinese Communists" to raise huge sums of money at home and abroad so that the Chinese Communists can obtain substantial material assistance.

(4) Negotiating transportation and communication links with certain parties so that the materials obtained and aided in Shanghai can be smoothly transported to the Communist areas.

(5) Inciting an anti-American movement to stir up an anti-American trend in China and the United States. It is reported that he has ordered specialized personnel to collect materials from all sides to compile and issue a so-called "Record of American Military Atrocities." In addition, he wants to infiltrate the Chinese Communist organization into the press, strengthen cultural propaganda offensives, strengthen worker organizations, and absorb technical personnel to go to the "Liberated Areas." From this, it can be seen that Mr. Zhou's trip to Shanghai is entrusted with a secret and major mission.

### Premier Sun's Remarks

[Central News Agency, This City] Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing a few days ago. A reporter called on his private residence yesterday and asked for his opinion on the recent launch of the so-called "Week of Responding to the Withdrawal of American Troops from China" by a small number of people in Shanghai. Mr. Sun said: "The withdrawal of American troops is by no means a serious issue. First, the American military has no intention of permanently stationing troops in China. Second, the American military's stationing in China was approved by the government and has a specific mission. Once the mission is completed, they should naturally withdraw. Third, the American military's stationing in China has not interfered in China's internal affairs, and it is groundless to say that it affects China's sovereignty and independence." The reporter then asked whether the recent proposals in some newspapers to keep Soviet troops stationed in Lushun and Dalian was of the same nature as the stationing of American troops in China. He said that according to the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, Dalian cannot station troops, and Lushun is a seaport shared by the two countries. Therefore, the stationing of Soviet troops in Lushun and Dalian cannot be confused with the stationing of American troops in China. Finally, the reporter inquired about Mr. Sun's views on the current domestic situation. He said that the current financial and economic situation is caused by errors in the policies of the administrative authorities.

### No Trace of Communist Troops in Western Suburbs, Fragrant Hills Hot Springs

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 8th] Xinhua News Agency broadcasted from Zhangjiakou on the 6th, falsely claiming that Communist troops had invaded Fragrant Hills and Hot Springs in the western suburbs. According to the spokesperson of the Beiping Pacification Headquarters: Although Communist troops attempted to invade the western suburbs around Shahe, Changping on September 29th, only minor clashes occurred because the National Army was prepared. The Communist troops did not succeed. The Communist propaganda about occupying Fragrant Hills and Hot Springs is a ridiculous lie. The area near these two places is safe and sound, with no trace of Communist troops.

### Weichang, Zhangbei, and Shangdu Recovered; Zhangjiakou and Duolun Shaken; Fierce Seesaw Battle in Eastern Suburbs of Huailai

[Our Correspondent, Shenyang, 8th] Director Du flew back to Shenyang on the afternoon of the 7th. In addition to attending the Beiping military conference, he also flew to Chengde to inspect military affairs.

[Our Correspondent, Shenyang, 8th] The National Army entered Weichang in the morning of the 7th and is now clearing the Communist troops around Weichang. Most of the Communist troops retreated towards Duolun. Weichang is bitterly cold, and residents are already wearing leather clothes. Director Du inspected Weichang on the 7th and gave instructions on military affairs, saying that the next step for the National Army will be to move towards Duolun to reduce the threat. Weichang is a base for the Communist troops and a barrier to the east of Duolun and Zhangjiakou. Now that the Communist troops have withdrawn from Weichang, Zhangjiakou and Duolun have been shaken.

[Central News Agency, Yebaishou, 8th] The National Army stationed in Ningcheng in the Rehe Province on the 7th.

[Central News Agency, Guihua, 8th] The National Army recovered Zhangbei (located about eighty li north of Zhangjiakou) around 1:00 PM on the 8th. Shangdu was also recovered by the National Army on the 6th.

[Our Correspondent, Beiping, 8th] It is certain that the National Army in Chahar entered Huailai on the afternoon of the 6th, staging street battles. It seems that they then withdrew. As of yesterday, the two armies were engaged in fierce battles in villages about ten li east of Huailai. The Communist troops seemed to be very stubborn, equipped with tanks and heavy artillery. The seesaw battle was extremely fierce, and the Communist troops continued to reinforce Huailai. The train service between Beiping and Nankou, which was once suspended due to Communist sabotage, has been restored, and military transport is busy. Qiao Tingshan, chairman of the Chahar Provincial Party Headquarters, went to Nankou by car on the afternoon of the 8th to supervise and improve party affairs.

### Liao Yaoxiang and Others Arrive in Shenyang

### The National Army Continues to Recover Gaoyou; North and South Routes of the Grand Canal Converge in Sishui; Li Mo'an Goes to Shaobo Frontline for Inspection

[Our Correspondent, Zhenjiang, 8th] The situation in northern Jiangsu has taken a sharp turn. Since the National Army launched a counterattack northward along the Grand Canal on the 6th and 7th, it has continued to recover important strongholds. The Communist troops have collapsed at the mere sight of them and have been completely defeated. The National Army took advantage of the victory to advance forward. At 8:00 AM on the 8th, they captured Gaoyou County in one fell swoop. The remaining Communist troops retreated towards Xinghua. At the moment, the National Army is continuing to advance north, and will soon meet the National Army that went south to Baoying in the Jieshou and Sishui areas. At this point, the entire Grand Canal, which was occupied by the Communist troops, can be completely opened.

[Our Correspondent, Taixian, 8th] After the National Army recovered Gaoyou, the Grand Canal has been opened. The remaining Communist troops retreated to the northeast. The National Army is tracking and advancing, and the vanguard has reached Baziqiao. The Xinghua Communist troops are wavering. At the moment, part of the National Army is advancing by waterway towards the county, reaching near Laoge. The entire area is marshland with no defenses to rely on, and it will not be difficult to recover.

[Our Correspondent, Zhenjiang, 8th] The north and south National Armies along the Grand Canal met in Sishui on the afternoon of the 8th. Also, the eastern National Army recovered Qiushuge on the 8th. Baziqiao and Fanchuan are advancing towards San Duo.

[Our Correspondent, Wuxi, 8th] Military News: On the afternoon of the 8th, the National Army successively recovered Fanchuan, an important stronghold northeast of Shaobo, and Mapeng Lake, twelve kilometers north of Gaoyou.

[Our Correspondent, Taixian, 8th] It is reported that the important documents and materials of the Gaoyou Communist troops have been transported by waterway to the Yancheng area. Also, the Communist troops in northern Xinghua, seeing the tension on all fronts, have been on strict alert for days and have been checking household registrations from time to time.

[Our Correspondent, Zhenjiang, 8th] After the good news of the recovery of Gaoyou was received, Zhenjiang was immediately enveloped in a joyful mood. The ancient city, which had been lingering on the edge of the low-pressure area of northern Jiangsu for a long time, suddenly regained its fresh and lively appearance. Those running to tell each other on the streets and alleys were all beaming with joy. The distant future of a bright northern Jiangsu is gradually unfolding in the minds of every citizen.

[Our Correspondent, Taixian, 8th] It is reported that Commander Li Mo'an, Director Dong Zanyao of the Jiangsu Office, and others took a special car to the Shaobo frontline for inspection yesterday. [See the War News from Shandong on page 3]

### Arch-Traitor Who Ruined the Country Did Not Repent Until Death: Lin Baosheng Executed Yesterday by Firing Squad, Claiming "Sacrificing Life for Righteousness" Before Execution

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Lin Baosheng, this Oriental Goebbels, was executed by firing squad today. He continued to spew venomous words until his death. At 1:20 PM on the 8th, a line of people waiting to visit prisoners was lined up at the right side of the gate of the Tiger Bridge Capital Prison, but everyone's eyes were unanimously focused on a middle-aged woman hiding under a small pine tree on the left side, trying to avoid the cameras of reporters, and two children. The woman wore a bun, a gray woolen cheongsam, a light cyan Mao coat, and yellowish-gray leather shoes, dressed very neatly; the girl was fourteen or fifteen years old, wearing a dark blue cloth cheongsam, light gray socks, black "Hercules" shoes, her face flushed; the boy was seven or eight years old, wearing a light cyan shirt, blue cloth overalls, yellow leather shoes, squatting on the ground, playing with a small rattan bag filled with sundries, rubbing his eyes from time to time, while the woman and the girl stroked him from time to time.

A bailiff took an official document and gave it to the woman. She read it, accepted it, her eyes red, and wrote a receipt: "Received a sentencing document, Lin Xu-ying, October 8th." She was Lin Baosheng's wife, and the two children were her daughter and nephew. At 2:15 PM, two more women arrived in rickshaws, hurriedly calling them away as they wept, attempting a last-ditch effort. But a quarter of an hour later, Chen Luo, an official from the Capital High Court, arrived, followed by a large group of reporters. It turned out that the afternoon of the 8th was the execution date for Lin Baosheng.

At 2:40 PM, before the simple case of interrogating the traitor Mei Si-ping, Lin Baosheng stood there. Supported by the bailiffs, he reluctantly left the prison. Under the scrutiny of reporters' cameras and gazes, he walked into the temporary courtroom, wearing a light gray Parisian Cantonese-style short-crotch suit, gray socks, black shoes, newly groomed hair, and wearing a pair of chrome-rimmed glasses, looking calm. His short, stout body stood calmly in front of the execution supervisor Chen, a faint smile on his pale face.

Stubborn to the End

"What's your name?" the execution supervisor asked.

"Lin Baosheng!" the traitor Lin replied.

"How old are you?"

"Forty-five years old."

"Where are you from?"

"Panyu, Guangdong."

"Where do you live?"

"13 Shanghai Road, Nanjing."

"Were you arrested for being a traitor?" (The traitor Lin nodded).

"Was your case tried by the Capital High Court?" (Nodded).

Now we are acting on the instructions of the Procuratorate of the Supreme Court, transferred by the Ministry of Judicial Administration, your death sentence is to be executed immediately, do you have any last words?

"Yes." The traitor Lin shook a black leather book, a booklet, and a kraft paper package he was holding in his hand.

"Good, you need to calm down at this moment!"

The traitor Lin chuckled wickedly, "It's nothing, it's nothing, this is a matter for the country, don't worry, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, I still have a few words to write!"

Laughable Distorted Poem

On a separate desk, he wrote a poem in running script on the last page of the book "For Xu Ying and my children to remember: Spring goes and spring comes at a fixed time, flowers bloom and fall without certainty, life's metabolism is also like this, what is there to refuse in sacrificing life for righteousness? Baosheng, October 8th, 2:55 PM." On the back cover, he also wrote two slogans: "Revolution to save the country, science to build the country!" It was an elementary English calculus textbook. At this time, the execution supervisor said: "It's 2:55!" After he finished writing, he submitted it along with the package of last words, a booklet written for someone else, and then took a step back, waiting for the execution supervisor to ask if there was anything else to say. He then straightened his clothes, puffed out his chest, and began his final speech:

Two Requests

"I feel regret that when I was asked to come out just now, they only said it was to meet with family members, and did not say it was for execution, which means that I was not prepared at all, this is not in accordance with legal procedures, although not telling the person involved may be because they are afraid of being timid, but it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, the country's affairs should be made public, I don't have any inheritance, but I am very relieved, because my family can survive by begging. I have two requests: First, do not tie me up like in the era of autocracy; second, do not cut my clothes like when inspecting Mei Si-ping!"

Two Bullets End His Life

The execution supervisor agreed to all of his requests, then picked up the pen and wrote heavily: "Death sentence executed!" A checkmark was made above and below the name, and the bailiffs escorted him out. He strode forward on Mei Si-ping's path. At 3:02 PM, with a loud bang, a bullet entered the back of his head and came out from the top of his skull. After he fell down, he turned over and lay on his back, blood shooting out from the bullet hole, but he was not completely dead, still groaning and breathing. Moving, blood also spurted from his mouth from time to time. After a minute and a half, another shot was fired, and he finally died at 3:08 PM, with a hideous and blurred face, and a red mouth that could not be closed. This oriental Goebbels continued to spew venomous words until his death.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] After the traitor Lin Baosheng was executed, his family was notified, and his two children and a nephew went to the Capital Prison to collect the body. It is said that the body was moved to a certain temple for encoffining.

### Suzhou High Procuratorate Issues Arrest Warrant for the Traitor Gao Guanwu

### Talking About the Limitless Bright Future of Xinjiang: Significant Progress in Politics and Economy, Universal Suffrage in the Whole Province Actively Underway

[Central News Agency, This City] Ma Yanzhang, manager of the Dihua branch of the Central Bank, who has lived in Xinjiang for three years and came to Shanghai via Hami and Chongqing this time, and plans to attend the third business meeting of the Central Bank held in Nanjing on the 11th, recently told reporters that Xinjiang has made significant progress in politics, economy, and finance. It is expected that within a few years, it will be transformed and enter the stage of modernization, comparable to other provinces. In terms of finance, the legal currency is in circulation, the currency system is stable, and the Central Bank has branches in Dihua and Hami, supplemented by the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau. Three years before the victory, the government resolved to unify the currency system of Xinjiang Province. According to the local price index at that time, it was stipulated that ten yuan of legal currency would be converted into one yuan of new currency. Moreover, the Central Bank actively promoted industrial and commercial remittances to facilitate the exchange of goods and smooth financial operations. In the first half of this year, remittances out reached more than 16 billion yuan, and remittances in reached 31.4 billion yuan. In terms of trade, the target is the Soviet Union. In the past, there was no control, and the barter system was very popular for a while. Exports mainly include wool, sheepskin, sheep intestines, silk, and raisins, exchanged for manufactured goods and luxury goods. Due to the environment, the people are deeply influenced by the Soviet Union, and Russian is popular. Before Soviet commerce is brought into order, smuggling is inevitable. The peak season for trade in the province is summer and autumn. In late autumn, it falls into snow and ice, and merchants cannot make a living. When merchants sell goods, they transport coarse cloth from inland areas to Dihua in northern Xinjiang in exchange for gold to make ends meet. Gold is produced in Xinjiang, and locals regard it as a treasure. Its price is calculated by the price of rice, and it is currently valued at 280,000 yuan per tael of legal currency. The actual weights and measures are still conservatively calculated at 125%. When unrest occurs locally, people often carry gold to flee, so gold prices are affected every time the situation fluctuates. Mr. Ma believes that the future of Xinjiang Province is bright because it is rich in products and has amazing reserves. The island of Su oil mine between Yili and Dihua is of unparalleled quality. If refined, it can become aviation fuel. Although it has been damaged by a certain party, it is not difficult to find ways to rectify it, and our government has paid attention to this. In addition to Dihua being the political and military center, Yili is also rich in grain, with sufficient rice and flour, and is the granary of the entire province. Coal and iron are readily available, especially the Ashan Tacheng gold mine, which is famous. Other places have their own specialties, and fruits are even more common. Except for the Tianshan Mountains as the dividing line between the north and south of Xinjiang, the province has few large mountains and rivers, and it is not difficult to reorganize transportation.

[Central News Agency, Dihua, 5th] (Delayed arrival) The universal suffrage of county magistrates, county councilors, and provincial councilors in Xinjiang is actively underway. The ten election supervision teams organized by the provincial government have all departed one after another yesterday and today. The provincial government believes that the election is a major event, and specially published a statement to the people, signed by Governor Zhang Zhizhong, Vice Governor Raheb Mati, and Bao Erhan, repeatedly emphasizing the meaning of "election according to law" and strictly prohibiting "fraudulent manipulation." The personnel of the election supervision team and all the previously announced changes have been made, and all district commissioners will not participate in the election supervision work. This was decided by the provincial government at its recent provincial affairs meeting. This time, the election of county magistrates in Xinjiang adopts the "nomination election" method, not a vote-based election, so the responsibility of the election supervision team is extremely important.

### Communist Troops in Southern Shandong Flee to Linyi, National Troops Enter Yixian and Zaozhuang, Fighting Still Fierce in the Eastern Section of the Jiaoji Railway

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 8th] The National troops in southern Shandong recovered Yixian at 10:00 AM on the 8th and entered Zaozhuang at 3:00 PM, and the Communist troops retreated to Linyi. Another National troop entered Shigeying, Nan-shigou (20 li east of Lincheng) and other strongholds.

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 8th] The fighting in the Jiaoxian area, north of Ji-bi, in the eastern section of the Jiaoji Railway has been fierce for several days. The battles on the line of Dujiamiaozi, Xiaozhaojia, Wulihouzi, Weng-qiu north of Jiaoxian and the line of Mashan and Lianhua Mountain north of Jimo were fierce on the 7th. The areas south of Yinmazhuang on the east bank of the Wei River in the middle section and the Zuoshan area are also in fierce fighting. After the National troops recovered Zuoshan yesterday on the 5th, they were recaptured by the Communist troops on the 6th. The National troops fought bravely and recaptured Zuoshan again. The Communist troops are actively increasing their troops in various battlefields. Most of the artillery fire used is transported from the Northeast. The battle is expected to enter a more intense stage. The Communist troops north and south of the railway line in the western section are still busy mobilizing and replenishing, and there are also attempts to launch another battle. The Communist troops near Zichuan and Boshan are actively increasing, and the war is imminent. After the Communist troops near Jining breached the dikes, the disaster area is vast. Wuliying east of the city of Jining and the area east of the railway and the canal are all flooded, with a water depth of more than one meter. South of the city, west of the canal, and south of Lijiaji to Wang-guitun, the autumn fields east and south of Daliudian were all submerged.

Editorial

### Don't Let Down the Expectations of the People

The overall situation of the country is extremely serious! The hope for peace had a glimmer of light, but it was covered by the shadow of the CCP's reply!

We read the public statement issued again yesterday by Ambassadors Marshall and Stuart, and the speech given by President Song after arriving in Nanjing yesterday, and we feel both joy and fear. The joy is that President Song said that the government has not given up the path of peaceful negotiation; the fear is that Mr. Zhou Enlai's reply has covered the dawn of peace, which could have been achieved by stopping the war in Zhangjiakou, with clouds.

The government has repeatedly called for a ceasefire and military reorganization, but the CCP insisted on discussing politics first, so there was the suggestion of the "Five-Person Group" by Ambassadors Marshall and Stuart to discuss political issues. After the government accepted it, the "Five-Person Group" should have been able to start immediately, but the CCP turned around and insisted on discussing a military ceasefire first. This is the first change. Later, the Five-Person Group (political) and the Three-Person Conference (military) could not agree, so the government, in order to take the overall situation into consideration, allowed the "Three" and "Five" to be held at the same time, pursuing both political and military solutions, so that a quick solution could be found for peace in China, which should not have been a problem. However, the CCP suddenly issued a memorandum on September 30, demanding that the government immediately stop attacking Zhangjiakou, otherwise it would consider the peace talks to have broken down, so the door to peace was almost blocked. This is the second change. At that time, everyone was worried, thinking that the government would hardly agree, and that the CCP was deliberately raising a difficult question, intending to break down the talks. This newspaper, in its editorial on the 4th, strongly advocated that "the overall situation of the country cannot be further delayed" and called on both sides to endure for the sake of the country. In particular, we expected the government to "be kind to others" and not to close the door to peace under any circumstances. Therefore, we believed that even if the war in Zhangjiakou was temporarily suspended for a few days, to wait for the discussion and resolution of all issues, it would not be impossible. Now, Ambassadors Marshall and Stuart stated that, upon the suggestion of the two ambassadors, President Chiang has agreed to order a halt to the advance on Zhangjiakou for sixteen days, during which time the Five-Person Group and the Three-Person Conference will be convened to discuss the two concessions proposed by the government in its October 2 statement. Logically speaking, since the CCP previously requested that the war in Zhangjiakou be stopped first before discussing other matters, now that the government has agreed to a ten-day ceasefire in Zhangjiakou, the CCP should immediately send representatives to attend the two meetings, and Mr. Zhou Enlai should especially come to Nanjing as soon as possible to be responsible for the negotiations. However, the CCP has changed its mind again, insisting that this ceasefire is only the government's strategy, and that discussing it during the ceasefire is under military pressure, so Mr. Zhou has no need to return to Nanjing. To be honest, although the government has agreed to a ten-day ceasefire in Zhangjiakou to resume peace talks, the CCP has rejected it again. This is the third change; and this third change is even more unexpected!

From this series of facts, the government is retreating step by step, hoping for peace all the time, while the CCP is pressing forward step by step, changing its mind all the time, and its attempt to break down the peace talks has been completely exposed. The CCP's approach is, in its own view, well-calculated, and it believes that once it announces a breakdown, it can establish its own government and find its own backers. But it does not know that it is violating public opinion and losing people's hearts, and everything will be impossible to discuss.

For the sake of the country, for the sake of the nation, and even for the sake of the CCP's own future, we sincerely advise the CCP not to let down the expectations of the people!

### China Textile Mill to Ration Three Types of Woolen Fabrics to Public School Teachers and Civil Servants

Detailed Measures to be Decided by the Executive Yuan

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Regarding the rationing of cheap cloth to public school teachers and civil servants, the investigation work has been completed. The China Textile Mill will be able to supply three types of woolen fabrics: (1) Uniform wool, sold at 12,000 yuan per yard, (2) Overcoat wool, sold at 15,000 yuan per yard, and (3) Beaverteen, which is surplus US military supplies, used by the Navy during the war, sold at 30,000 yuan per yard. The above prices are the lowest cost prices for October, and may need to be appropriately increased in the future when distributed. The current difficulty is that the quantity is not enough. The China Textile Mill can only supply one-third of the total demand, and the remaining amount will be made up within two months. Therefore, the start time and detailed measures for this rationing are still to be decided by the Executive Yuan.

### Portuguese Spy Luo Mingzhi Indicted by the Sichuan Procuratorate for Sneaking into the Interior to Gather Military Intelligence During Wartime

[Central News Agency Chongqing, 7th] The case of Luo Mingzhi (original name Laurence Oswal Dcenna), a Portuguese spy suspect who was previously transferred from Kunming to Chongqing by the Military Intelligence Bureau, has been concluded by the Sichuan High Court First Branch Procuratorate. He is deemed to have violated Article 1, Paragraph 1, Items 1, 4, and 5 of the Emergency Criminal Law for Endangering the Republic of China. A public prosecution is initiated according to Article 230 of the Criminal Procedure Law. Luo Mingzhi is currently forty-four years old, his father is Portuguese, and his mother is Chinese. He grew up in Shanghai. In October 1937, he went to Macau and served as a police officer in the Portuguese government, eventually being promoted to detective. He had close ties with Chen Rengui, a special agent stationed in Macau by the Japanese. At that time, he assisted in disrupting the organization and facilities of Chinese government personnel stationed in Macau in order to obtain rewards. In November 1943, he was ordered by Chen Rengui to sneak into the interior, tasked with gathering military intelligence on our side. He initially served at the Hongmei Restaurant in Guilin (frequented by many Allied military personnel stationed in China), specializing in receiving foreign guests. The following year, in October, when Guilin was evacuated, he transferred to Kunming and took a managerial position at the American Red Cross Victory Club as a cover to achieve his mission. Last winter, he was detected by the Anti-Espionage Intelligence Office of the Aviation Commission Investigation Team in Kunming and the American Counterintelligence Reporting Office stationed in Kunming. He was arrested and sent to the Military Intelligence Bureau, which transferred him to the Sichuan High Court First Branch Procuratorate. After extensive interrogation, Luo Mingzhi absolutely denied the facts of his crime, but ultimately failed to justify his actions. Furthermore, the Procuratorate has obtained a substantial amount of relevant evidence, all of which proves that he was indeed a spy sent by the Japanese to the Chinese interior. Therefore, a public prosecution has been initiated according to the law.

### Northern Jiangsu has been Sacked by Communist Troops, This Year's Tax Exemptions Extended to Newly Recovered Areas; People Hope to Dredge the Canal to Revitalize the Region

[Our Huaiyin Dispatch, 5th] Most of the supplies in the newly recovered areas of northern Jiangsu have been carried away by the Communist troops, leaving little for the civilian population. It is reported that in order to alleviate the hardships of the people, the government has not only already exempted the land tax for the 34th year of the Republic, but will also exempt the land tax for this year. The order is expected to be announced soon.

[Our Huaiyin Dispatch, 5th] Today, I traveled along the Lianghuai Highway to inspect Huai'an. I am the first reporter to arrive here after the area was recovered. The highway is intact, but only military jeeps can pass. There are no commercial vehicles. Huai'an has three cities: the old and new outer cities. It was formerly the headquarters of the Central China Military Region of the Communist troops. The market is now depressed, and the number of returning people is limited. The scene is desolate. I searched the entire city and found no restaurants or hotels, only a few bathhouses open for business. The price of local products is very low. The residents who remained in the city do not know the value of the legal currency; everything is calculated in copper coins. Copper coins are worth 1,500 yuan in legal currency. Imported foreign goods, such as Marlboro cigarettes, cost 2,500 yuan per pack. I visited the "Crotch Crossing Bridge" of Han Xin. Only a stele remains; the bridge is no longer there. The current residents are looking forward to the dredging of the canal, hoping to revitalize the region.

Now, the main force of Liao Bingnan's bandits in Taihu Lake has been pacified, and the sporadic small bandits are also being cleared out in order. However, the traitor Xue Yonghui's troops are still roaming in the area, disturbing the locality. The headquarters has decided to further exterminate them completely. Director Chen Jian has also contacted relevant authorities in Shanghai to use landing craft to clear the lake. Furthermore, Liao Bingnan's troops have been stationed in Xukou, Suzhou, responsible for defense. Liao Bingnan himself came to Xi on the 5th and visited Chief of Staff Mao that evening, expressing his loyalty to the Party and the country and his maintenance of the locality.

### Investigating Enemy and Puppet Toxic Crimes; Wuxian District Court Opens Court for Interrogation

[Our Suzhou Dispatch] The Wuxian District Court Procuratorate, acting on orders from superiors, is investigating the enemy and puppet toxic crimes during the occupation of Suzhou.

However, none of the defendants appeared, indicating that they were evading punishment. Therefore, interrogation could not be carried out. According to Prosecutor Luo, if they fail to appear again after being summoned, arrest warrants will be issued or requests for wanted notices will be filed in order to bring them to justice. It is reported that there are still some major opium dealers who have not been reported, and it is planned to conduct a new investigation and report them one by one, and summon them for interrogation together. Furthermore, Ding Guangshi, who served as a standing director of the Suzhou Special Industry Association during the enemy and puppet period, fled in fear of punishment after the victory.

### Unexpected Harvest Amidst Conclusion; Investigation Team Receives Threatening Letter; Signed "Colleagues Receiving in Wuhan"; Letter Contains Drawings of Two Hand Grenades

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 8th] In the midst of concluding its work, the Hunan-Jiangxi District Investigation Team suddenly received a threatening letter signed "Colleagues Receiving in Wuhan". The letter contained drawings of two hand grenades, with the words "Emergency Warning" written above. The body of the letter read: "The investigation work should stop at an appropriate point. Patting flies and touching tigers, it is easy to get rich through receiving. Seeking fame and fishing for reputation through supervision and reporting, getting by is enough, why bother? What does it matter to you what others have obtained through fortune? You can stop if you have profited from gold digging. If you don't get out, beware of bombs." The letter was signed "Mr. Qiu Ao, for your consideration." After receiving the letter, Qiu told reporters with a smile: "This letter can be used as a report from our team to the central government." He added that the sender would gain nothing else from it. Qiu was originally scheduled to fly to Nanjing today, but since the concluding meeting of the joint office of the team in Nanjing is still pending, he has decided to return to Hunan first.

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 7th] The spokesperson for the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi District Investigation Team recently made the following observations to reporters regarding the investigation: (A) The local situation is not simple, and the receiving authorities are unable to control it, leading to chaos, and some people are inevitably robbing from it. (B) The lists are disorganized, and many agencies have changed heads several times, making it impossible to conduct a complete and systematic investigation, which is a great pity. (C) In Hubei Province, the investigation mainly covered Wuhan, and the other forty-one counties and cities, such as Yichang and Huanggang, were not thoroughly investigated, which is another shortcoming. (D) It is hoped that the court will appreciate the great significance of this central investigation and bring the cases transferred to the court for trial to a swift conclusion, without injustice. (E) This team is coming to an end, but this work can still be reported to the Supervisory Commissioner's Office or the judicial authorities. It is hoped that everyone will continue to work hard with justice and determination in order to completely eradicate corruption and establish a clean and honest atmosphere.

### Wuhan Garrison Headquarters Military Court Sentences Two Japanese and Taiwanese War Criminals; One to Life Imprisonment, One to Seven and a Half Years

[Hankou Dispatch] Japanese war criminal Ishigami Tetsushi, alias Shi Zhengtang, has been involved in Japanese aggression since 1934. In Liaoning, Nanjing, and other places, he engaged in secret activities under the guise of doing business. In 1940, he served as a translator for the Independent 18th Brigade of the Japanese 106th Division, and later as a liaison officer for the 97th Brigade of the 34th Division, carrying out espionage work in various counties in Hubei. He also organized the Xingya Association in Yichang, held the Dandao Association in Dangyang, and served as a part-time director of the Xiling Palace and a leader of the Zhian Palace, colluding with local officials, gangsters, and traitors to betray China and serve the Japanese army. He also continuously sold opium through his organized Xingya Association, implementing a toxic policy. After the Japanese army surrendered, he was captured by the intelligence team of the 66th Army Headquarters of the National Army and handed over to the military prosecutor of the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters Military Court for investigation and prosecution. He was sentenced to life imprisonment. Another Taiwanese war criminal, Ke Dashu, was dispatched to Hankou in June 1940 by the Japanese Consul Hana Wheel to serve as a secretary in the puppet Hankou Municipal Police Bureau. He later served concurrently as the chief of the Economic Police Department of the Jia Hankou Police Bureau, and successively served as the leader of the Investigation Team of the Puppet Hubei Provincial Material and Price Investigation Committee, and the head of the Joint Office of the Economic Police Bureaus of the Puppet Wuyang and Hankou Police Bureaus. Relying on the power of the Japanese, he arbitrarily imposed fines on merchants and profited from them. Any violation of his will resulted in detention or other harm. After the Japanese army surrendered, he was sent to the Hubei Provincial High Court by the joint supervision office of the military, police, and gendarmerie, and then transferred to the military prosecutor of the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters Military Court for investigation and prosecution. He was sentenced to imprisonment for seven and a half years and deprivation of public rights for seven years.

### A Young Man from Shanghai Commits Suicide in Suzhou; Suicide Note States It Was to Rescue His Family, But He Steadfastly Refuses to Tell the Truth After Being Rescued

[Our Suzhou Dispatch] Xu Zhixiang, a 20-year-old young man from Shanghai, a painter by profession, residing at No. 6, Lane 477, North Henan Road, came to Suzhou on the morning of the 4th of this month and checked into the International Hotel at No. 212, Hulong Street. He carried three net bags containing daily necessities and some old clothes. He was assigned room 112. He often went out and appeared calm, so the room attendant did not suspect anything. The next morning (the morning of the 5th), the room attendant, on change of shift, asked him to pay the room fee, but Xu Zhixiang politely asked if he could pay it together tomorrow and changed to room 118 to continue his stay. On the 5th, he still went out for a long time. He returned to his room late in the evening, closed the door, and went to sleep peacefully. He was not seen moving on the 6th. Until 4:00 PM, the on-duty room attendant Zhou Chunfa opened the door and peeped in, discovering that Xu Zhixiang's face was pale. He quickly informed Li Jinsheng, the manager of the hotel. He entered the room and found an empty bottle of Lysol disinfectant under the bed, confirming that he had taken poison. He was rushed to the Jingde Road Health Hospital for gastric lavage and emergency treatment. He slowly woke up two hours later and was sent back to the nearby Third Police Station. The police station had already sent Police Chief Wang Yixin to investigate. Three suicide notes, an empty Lysol bottle, six pawn tickets, and some other old clothes were seized. He had no money on him. The three suicide notes are as follows: (1) To escape the feudal family, I embarked on the path of suicide to obtain freedom in the afterlife and fulfill the wishes in my heart. Signed, Zhixiang. (2) Brother Li Ping, please give one of the net bags in my room to Gu Bin, and please convey my regards to Gu Bin on my behalf. (The bag contains Gu Bin's belongings, so give it to him.) Yours, Zhixiang. (3) This net bag belongs to Gu Bin, a soldier of the Second Platoon, First Squad, Second Company, First Battalion of the Security First Brigade. Please present it to him. Zhixiang. The brigade is currently residing in the Tianxing Garden Auditorium in front of the Zhenfu Temple. Zhixiang leaves a note. The police station went to the above locations to summon the team, but the team had already left, and no results were obtained. He repeatedly asked Xu Zhixiang the reason for his suicide, but he kept his mouth shut and could not be speculated. The police station prepared a document and transferred the case to the Third Police Station. His family from Shanghai came to Suzhou to claim him.

Stopping Extortion by Boatmen is Urgently Needed

At the back gate of the Lv family in Ningbo, there are many boatmen rowing boats, navigating the main lines of various locations of Shannan, directly reaching Hetou City. Due to the numerous boats, a group of drifters formed a gang with significant latent power. Although nominally helping customers carry luggage and belongings, they are actually forcibly extorting money. Because passengers pass through this place, regardless of whether you are willing or not, they uniformly demand fees of two to three thousand yuan or more, calling it "upper river money" and "lower river money." These people are essentially highway robbers. It was like this during the enemy and puppet era, and since the victory, they are still menacing. If you don't give them money, they not only won't let you pass but will also beat you up. Passengers suffer their abuse but still have to pay them. I have witnessed this and experienced it myself. I earnestly request the Ningbo police authorities to implement strict crackdowns to ensure the safety of travelers. (Shaofei)

Sock Factories Request Universal Allocation of Cotton Yarn

According to regulations, knitting factories can purchase cotton yarn from the China Textile Corporation (Zhongfang). We recently followed the procedures to register with the guild first, so that it could be forwarded to Zhongfang for processing. Now, according to the guild, Zhongfang has stopped processing registration matters, and new applicants cannot be approved. It is also said that those who have already been approved must re-register and go through the procedures again, but the date for re-registration is far off. Therefore, some sock factories can receive allocated yarn, while those who have not yet registered cannot enjoy this right. We hope that the yarn allocation authorities can establish regulations as soon as possible so that we sock factories that have been left out can complete the procedures and everyone can receive allocated yarn. This is the common request of our sock factories. (Hu Yi)

### The Peace Conference Continues to Discuss the Treaty with Italy: Representatives from Various Countries Debate Fiercely, The Trieste Question is the Most Difficult, Bevin Warns Southern Countries Not to Make More Mistakes

[Our Newspaper News] London, 8th Radio: The Paris Peace Conference continued its plenary session today. British Foreign Secretary Bevin delivered a speech, stating that he absolutely opposed the draft treaty with Italy because the obligations stipulated in the draft were beyond the ability of the new Italy to bear. Bevin also warned Yugoslavia not to repeat the same mistakes as with the Trieste issue.

Another dispatch: Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris threw a "bomb" at the Peace Conference's plenary session today, urging the representatives to reject Articles 21 and 22 of the treaty with Italy, which stipulate that Italy recognize and respect Albania's sovereignty and cede the island of Saseno to Albania. The Greek Prime Minister pointed out that the island should belong to Greece.

[Reuters Paris, 8th] The plenary session of the Peace Conference began at 9:30 AM today with Molotov as chairman. A total of nine speakers, including the four major powers, are scheduled to speak today and express their opinions on the most thorny issue of Trieste. Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak spoke first, saying that the general pessimism about the Peace Conference seemed excessive. Spaak pointed out that rebuilding the world was not easy when the concept of retaliation was still in people's hearts. Because the victorious countries suffered heavy losses, even the slightest problem seemed difficult. Spaak then criticized the procedural rules of this conference, saying that their results were enough to prevent the motions and cooperation of small countries. He hoped that a more reasonable procedural law could be adopted when negotiating the peace treaty with Germany. Polish representative Zimosky then spoke, saying that the treaty with Italy should first give Yugoslavia fair treatment. Yugoslavia suffered the most damage during the war, and the Gorizia region of Italy should be ceded to Yugoslavia. The free zone of the port of Trieste should be limited to the urban area. Greek representative Tsaldaris believed that Italy's compensation of 100 million US dollars to Greece was too small. Italy's current economic situation is very good, while Greece is still devastated and should receive more compensation.

[Our Newspaper News] Paris, 8th Radio, New York News: US Treasury Secretary Humes departed for Paris today.

The Key to the Success or Failure of the Peace Conference

[Reuters Paris, 7th] After South African Prime Minister Smuts claimed in the plenary session of the Peace Conference that the Paris Peace Conference had not failed, some representatives felt that his words were indeed those of an old politician, but others believed that it was too early to tell. However, in any case, the basis for optimism depends on the following two things: (1) Whether the Soviet delegation will again express opposition when the Peace Conference's plenary session votes on the Italian Political Committee's recommendations on Trieste the day after tomorrow. Whether the Soviet Union promises to be bound by the Peace Conference's recommendations on Trieste when the foreign ministers of the four powers draft the final text of the Italian peace treaty after the Peace Conference. Before these two questions are answered, it is impossible to immediately determine the success or failure of the Peace Conference.

### Guo Taiqi Reiterates Our Opinion: It Is Not Appropriate to Overburden Italy's Economy, Advocates that Libya Should Achieve Independence

[Agence France-Presse Paris, 7th] The Paris Peace Conference continued its plenary session at the Luxembourg Palace at 9:35 PM tonight. Ukrainian representative Manuisky first spoke, criticizing the resolution made by the Peace Conference on the four districts of Trieste. Dr. Guo Taiqi, Acting Head of the Chinese Delegation, then delivered a speech, saying that the efforts made by the Peace Conference have enabled people from all countries in the world to have a further understanding of maintaining lasting world peace, so it cannot be said to be futile. The committees have spent a very long time, working hard, and discussing various issues, which is worthy of praise. Speaking of China's attitude, I believe that the military terms of the treaty with Italy should be sufficient to prevent the recurrence of aggressive wars. In terms of economic terms, the compensation to be paid should not impose an excessive burden on the Italian economy. As for politics and territory, I am very pleased that several special clauses in the treaty related to China can be passed smoothly. I still remember that during the Boxer Rebellion, Italy demanded 27 million US dollars from China in compensation for the deaths of seven overseas Chinese, but at this time, China did not demand any compensation from Italy. Not only that, China was also the first among all countries to return all the property of Italian overseas Chinese in the country to the original owners. He also said that he fully agreed with the plan put forward by France on the Trieste issue. Regarding the disposal of Italy's old colonies, we firmly advocate that it should be discussed and that Libya should be independent immediately, otherwise it should at least be placed under the trusteeship of the United Nations for several years.

### Indonesia Convenes a Conference, Dutch Governor Addresses the Meeting On the Spot Saying That He Has Started to Set Up Public Opinion Institutions

[Reuters Batavia, 8th] The Indonesian Conference was held in Bangal, north of Celebes. Representatives from various Eurasian, Chinese, and Arab people attended the meeting. The Dutch three-member delegation also attended the meeting. Dutch Governor Van Mook addressed the meeting on the spot, expressing his gratitude for the assistance of the United Kingdom. Van also explained the reason why Indonesia's public opinion representative institutions have not yet been established, saying that the situation in the East Indies is complicated, and the government has to take into account the relationship with the mother country, military affairs, the British government, Indonesian people with republican ideas, and the lack of sympathy from the outside world. However, he said that recently, steps have been taken to establish this public opinion representative institution. Regarding the British army, Van said: There are those in the British army who have been actively serving for more than six years, and the British will never fight against the Indonesian people.

### Britain Builds New Strategic Base to Protect the Lifeline of the Middle East

The Status of Suez is Important and Will Never Be Abandoned

[United Press London, 7th] A senior Army Department official announced today that the British General Staff has proposed that the British administrative and supply bases in various parts of Palestine in the Middle East and in Kenya and Tanganyika in South Africa be abolished, and only forward military bases be maintained in Sudan, Palestine, Transjordan, and Iraq. The period is limited to what is practically feasible. This change is due to the gradual withdrawal of British troops from India, Egypt, and the unstable situation in Palestine. Although the precariousness and instability of the situation in Palestine has prompted the General Staff to make this proposal, the British army will never withdraw completely from the area. Military generals strongly support the possibility of developing the Negev Desert area in southern Palestine, and at least a combat base will be established there, equipped with limited supply stations. As times change, Britain is changing its century-old policy of protecting the lifeline of the intercontinental empire, which is inevitable. However, Defense Minister Alexander will never give up the Suez Canal politically or militarily, and will not give up Palestine and retreat to the Negev. The reason is here. At present, there are three divisions of British troops stationed in Palestine, which is almost the largest force of the British in the Middle East. Once the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty is revised, Egypt will inevitably lose its long-term military plans. Iraq has also become an unknown in the Chulai Plan. The Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930 is valid for another nine years, but the Iraqi government formally proposed to revise the treaty at the beginning of this year, which will eventually lead to the complete withdrawal of British troops. In addition to Palestine, Malta, and Cyprus, Britain can only station a small number of troops indefinitely in Transjordan. Palestine and Transjordan are not suitable for accommodating large-scale naval, land, and air force bases.

[US News Agency Washington, 7th] The new US Secretary of Commerce, Harriman, was sworn in today, with Justice Minister Vincent administering the oath.

### After Being Released from Nuremberg, Schacht is Arrested Again and Will Be Tried by the Anti-Nazi Tribunal

[Associated Press Stuttgart, 7th] Former German Minister of Economy Schacht arrived here tonight from Nuremberg for only one hour before being arrested by German police under orders. He is now being held in the Stuttgart police prison and will be charged with his former relationship with the Nazis and tried by the anti-Nazi tribunal here. Schacht immediately protested and took out a letter from the US military government, proving that he was free to act in the US-occupied area, but the police ignored it. Schacht then requested permission to meet with his wife and his lawyer, and to appeal directly to the German official who issued the arrest warrant. The US military government also issued a statement on this matter, saying that if the German side prosecutes Schacht, it is within the scope of German law and has nothing to do with the US military government. The US military government is only concerned that the case must be conducted according to law.

[Our Newspaper News] Paris, 8th Emergency Radio: Frankfurt News, General McNarny confirmed that twelve Nazi war criminals who were sentenced to death by the Nuremberg Tribunal will be executed on October 16 as scheduled.

[Reuters Frankfurt, 8th] The Allied Control Council is scheduled to meet tomorrow to discuss the appeals of the Nazi leaders convicted by the Nuremberg Tribunal. The meeting was convened by General Koenig, the current chairman of the Control Council from France.

### The Nuremberg Gang is Busy Writing Letters and Reading Books, Enjoying Milk and Coffee with Good Appetites

[Our Newspaper News] Paris, 8th Radio Nuremberg News: Nazi war criminal Frank, who was sentenced to death, said he did not want to see his wife again. The wives of Uter, Ribbentrop, etc. all eagerly hope to meet their husbands for the last time. The lawyers of the defendants have been unable to see their clients for three days, but they can only communicate with each other in writing, and each communication is carefully checked by experts. Jittel, Frank, Ribbentrop, and Streicher are all busy writing memoirs, but they are still immersed in writing long letters. Goering also sends out many family letters. Suker and Streicher never liked to write letters, but at this time they have to write a lot. The library in the Nuremberg prison is full of books of all kinds, ancient and modern. Suker, Rosenberg, and Spier are all immersed in classical literature and history, while Kaltenbrunner occasionally asks for modern works. The elderly Neurath prefers romance novels. Every day, the chaplains and priests of the occupying forces pray for them. The three meals are still good, with an average daily ration of 2,500 calories. Breakfast includes bread and coffee, lunch includes canned beef and potatoes, and occasionally you can eat a few more slices of white bread and sugar. Most of the war criminals have good appetites. Hess, during the long trial, used the excuse that the food was poisonous and refused to eat it lightly. Now he has reversed his usual state and also has a surprisingly good appetite. Everyone sleeps peacefully. The prison authorities strictly enforce the "silence" rule, so there is no midnight disturbance. Postal workers who deliver letters wear soft canvas hats instead of the white helmets of the military police, because the sound of the helmets touching the door may wake up the prisoners. The prisoners sentenced to death all have the freedom to write wills. The remaining seven prisoners who were sentenced to imprisonment will remain temporarily imprisoned in Nuremberg. Soldiers are still allowed to wear uniforms, but of course they are not allowed to wear medals and rank insignia. The prisoners in the prison receive an average of 50 letters a day, coming from all over Germany.

[Our Newspaper News] London, Radio, 8th: The German war criminals who were sentenced to death are still in the lower level of the Nuremberg prison, while those who were sentenced to imprisonment are in the upper level.

### The Far East Tribunal Opens, The Soviet-Japanese Relations Section Proves That the "Tanaka Memorial" is True

[Remodeling Society Tokyo, 8th] The Far East International Tribunal entered the stage of examining Japanese-Soviet relations today. Many Soviet people were suddenly seen in the VIP seats and the United Nations reporters' seats. After the court opened, Soviet prosecutor Kolensky first read a long statement in Russian, detailing Japan's aggression against the Soviet Union over the decades, saying that Japan's aggression against the Soviet Union was related to the entire world war and could not be discussed separately. Therefore, it is necessary to briefly involve Japan's occupation of the Northeast, the relationship between the Axis powers, and the aggression against China. At the same time, it is stated that Japan's aggression against the Soviet Union must be traced back to the historical background before 1928. In 1904, Japan attacked the Russian fleet in Lushun in bad faith and was criticized by world public opinion. The truth of this historical event can be understood today after the Pearl Harbor incident.

[United Press Tokyo, 8th] Today, the Soviet Union began its accusations against the main Japanese war criminals, submitting a 65-page statement to the International Tribunal, which accused Japan of violating the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Treaty and said that Emperor Hirohito should be tried as a war criminal. A United Press reporter learned that the Soviet Union will present evidence to prove that the "Tanaka Memorial," which was intended to dominate the world, actually existed.

### American Extravagant Lifestyle (Part 2)

The Darlings of Fortune Lavish Money Like Dirt; Scarcity of Goods Exceeds Supply (Translated by Yu Jing)

Trend of Extravagance Sweeps the Nation

Because a change in mental attitude is the trend of the times, all aspects show signs of extreme extravagance. The most obvious example is the church. Many churches have paid off their debts, which is an unprecedented fact in church history. Whenever church members gather, the collection plates are full of checks, and many people voluntarily burn church mortgage notes. The trend of extravagance starts with sports. The number of participants in football, basketball, baseball, track and field events has gradually increased to break any record of the era. People don't mind spending 100 U.S. dollars to watch a boxing match between Louis and Conn. A fat British man named Bruce, who traveled in the United States, said: "The people of America are playing all day long. When do they work?"

Farmers in a certain rural area buy small airplanes to fly around in the fields. Champagne fountains splash at welcome parties for new stars. Car accidents have also reached a new peak, and even crime has exceeded last year's by 16%. In short, everything is setting unprecedented records. The situation in cities and villages throughout the United States has been affected. In Reno, which has a population of only 28,000, a gas station that sold for $22,000 a few years ago has now risen to $300,000. Farmland in a certain area sold for $90 per acre five years ago, but now it is $140 per acre. More than 70 million people have purchased life insurance to protect their lives. For every yacht that is manufactured, there are ten customers who place orders. It is estimated that among the 34 million families in the United States, 14.5 million have savings, and 16 million receive salaries, requiring the purchase of 8 million different kinds of goods.

Black Market Rampant; Price Increases in Disguise

The ban on the black market was enacted 20 years ago, but now it is rampant. In the United States this year, you can get anything you want as long as you have money. For example, to buy a car, it has long been recognized that you must buy other parts, and these parts do not have invoices. If you rent an apartment, it is easy to find an apartment for $50 a month, but the furniture in the room costs $1,500, with only a bed and an old lamp from 20 years ago.

Americans believe that this prosperity will come to an end in about 15 years, because demand will change again in 15 years. What will follow 15 years later? Few people dare to say that it is a stable state of prosperity, and many people think that it must be a "depression." This popular view is not necessarily reliable. They have overlooked various aspects of the problem. For example, the important mechanical industry in the United States is sufficient to maintain over this period, foreign trade may increase, and artificial forces may come to avoid this depression. Most importantly, the country's resources and the planning of needs are sufficient to avoid the advent of this depression.

Because American highways still need to be repaired, schools, hospitals, and bridges need to be increased, river irrigation, flood control, river and harbor improvements, and ditch installations are endless. The 1,077 cities across the country with a population of more than 10,000 all need complete municipal plans. And the whole world needs American products. For example, there are already 100 million orders for American-made locomotives. As long as this production is properly controlled, it may allow the United States to smoothly pass the 15-year mark.

According to general speculation, if prices do not rise by 5% or 10% this year, the terrible depression of the previous 15 years may not occur. If it rises by more than 20%, an economic panic is very likely to occur.

### Hitler Had an Illegitimate Son with Goebbels' Wife; Both Died Before the Fall of Berlin

[United Press Munich, 7th] The former German State Secretary, Mrs. Messner, said today: Hitler had an affair with Goebbels' wife and had a son. Before the fall of Berlin, when the Goebbels family committed suicide, this son also died. Goebbels knew that Hitler was the father of this child, so he used this to blackmail him. Currently, only one person knows this secret. The child's name was Helmut, born in 1935. Later, the relationship between the two gradually became estranged, but Hitler was still deeply in love. This child looked very much like his biological father, so Hitler was very concerned.

They flew in two Royal Air Force transport planes, modified from British wartime aircraft, via Malta, Baghdad, Calcutta, Singapore, and Hong Kong.

Those who went to the airport to welcome them included Mr. Zhang Peter, Chief of the Protocol Section of the Municipal Government, representing Mayor Wu; Mr. Chen Guolian, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Mr. Zhang Dingling, representing Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs; Mr. Hutchinson, Commercial Counsellor of the British Consulate-General in Shanghai; Ms. Hender, British representative of UNRRA in China; and Mr. Stewart, British Naval Officer, and more than ten others.

After Sir Bowes and the delegation members got off the plane, they shook hands with the welcomers one by one, expressing their gratitude for the sincerity of the welcome from all sectors. Sir Bowes also told reporters that they were very willing to report everything to the reporters and that a press conference would be held today. Personal interviews have also been planned. The delegation will reside in three locations here: Cathay Hotel, Cathay Mansions, and 20 Rue Cardinal Mercier. Sir Bowes himself will stay at the Cathay Hotel. The delegation had a dinner at the British Consulate-General last night, and Commercial Counsellor Hutchinson will host a banquet to welcome them tonight, especially inviting Mayor Wu and people from all walks of life in China and abroad to attend. Mayor Wu is also scheduled to host a banquet for the delegation at his private residence on the afternoon of the 12th.

It is reported that the purpose of the delegation's visit to China is to conduct sightseeing and to investigate and study the trade situation in various parts of China, so as to promote Sino-British trade. They plan to stay here until the 15th of this month, and then go to Nanjing to meet with senior Chinese government officials to exchange views on economic issues. They will then visit West and North China, and return to Shanghai around November 20. At that time, they will stay for another week before leaving China via Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Guangdong.

The delegation is scheduled to hold a press conference at 3:00 PM today in the conference room of Jardine Matheson & Co. on the third floor of 27 The Bund.

It is reported that the police sub-bureaus have begun active training since the beginning of this month, and the general bureau's administrative office has been busy with various preparations in recent days.

### Airmail to Europe Can Be Forwarded via Hong Kong

The Shanghai Postal Administration announced that British Overseas Airways Corporation has now opened a direct air route from Hong Kong to Poole, England. Airmail (letters and postcards) to the United Kingdom and other European countries (excluding the Soviet Union), the Near East, Africa, and Australia can now be forwarded via Hong Kong. However, airmail letters delivered via this route should be marked "By air via Hongkong" on the envelope by the sender. Airmail letters sent to the above-mentioned areas without a specified route will still be forwarded via Calcutta.

In addition, the post office will be closed for one day on National Day according to regulations. The office hours of the Administration and its branches on that day will be in accordance with the Sunday schedule.

According to Wang Guangyu, the assistant manager of the Shanghai Post Office, who spoke to reporters, the post office is actively seeking to expand and improve after the war, but the funding is very tight and the income does not cover the expenses. It relies entirely on central government subsidies, so it has signed a request to the Ministry of Communications to increase postal rates in order to increase revenue. The request has not yet been approved. It was rumored that it would be announced after the National Assembly was convened, but this is not the case. The postal rate increase is currently being discussed and approved by the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Communications.

Dahua Airlines officials, feeling unable to close down, sent representatives to Beijing the day before yesterday to visit Minister Yu of the Ministry of Communications and seek instructions on everything.

### Method of Calculating Fares for U.S. Military Transportation

### Power Shortage Diminishes the City's Glamour; Neon Lights Go Out; Industry Representatives Petition the Municipal Government to Lift the Ban

[Our Own Dispatch] The neon lights that adorn Shanghai's night market have now dimmed. Last night, reporters drove around the city and found that the neon lights, which used to compete in redness and greenness, and winked their eyes, were no longer visible. The restoration of neon lights in the city was originally decided by the Municipal Advisory Council, with the initial intention of adding to the atmosphere of prosperity after the victory. However, in this time of power shortage, the electricity consumption of factories in the city has been reduced by 25,000 kilowatts each month, and the supply of electric heating to users has also been suspended. It is inevitable that maintaining purely extravagant advertising neon lights will cause psychological resentment among all sectors of society. Zhao Zengyu, Director of the Bureau of Public Utilities, said: Neon light factories in the city may temporarily switch to fluorescent lamps. The period of limited use is very short, and once the power supply is sufficient, they can be restored at any time.

[Our Own Dispatch] More than forty neon electrician units in the city have decided to prepare a written petition to the municipal government, requesting sympathy for the people's difficulties and lifting the restriction on the supply of electricity to neon lights, as they will all be forced to close down due to the authorities' ban on the use of neon lights.

### Introduction to the British Trade Delegation to China

— From the Materials Office of this Newspaper

The British Trade Delegation to China arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong yesterday and will stay in Shanghai for several days before proceeding to Nanjing, Hankou, Chongqing, Jinan, Beiping, Kunming, and other places. It is scheduled to return to Shanghai around November 20, and then return home via Guangzhou and Taiwan. He is the head of the British Trade Delegation to China.

Purpose of the Delegation

The purpose of the delegation is to learn about the true situation of general industry and commerce in China, so as to determine the path that future trade between China and the United Kingdom should follow. It is hoped that through contact with various aspects of the Chinese business community, some opinions on the recovery plan will be formed to help China achieve its economic balance. At a time when the Sino-British trade treaty is being negotiated, the mission of this trade delegation is naturally very important for the establishment of future trade relations between China and the United Kingdom.

The Head of the Delegation is an Expert on Transportation Issues

The British Trade Delegation consists of twelve people, including representatives from all aspects of the British business community, with Sir Bowes as the head. Sir Bowes is an expert on transportation issues and an important figure in the British railway locomotive manufacturing industry. He was born in South Wales in 1895 and participated in the First World War. In 1924, he obtained a master's degree from Oxford University. He has been a Member of Parliament since 1929 until last year. He is currently the Chairman and General Manager of GWR Railway Carriage & Wagon Co., Chairman of Gloucester Railway Carriage & Wagon Co., Vice Chairman of Gloucester Gas Company, and the person in charge of many other factories. With his rich knowledge and experience, he served as a consultant to the British delegation to the League of Nations early on, and participated in the parliamentary economic visit to Australia. This time

The Origins of the Seven Delegates

Accompanying him are seven other delegates: Mr. Bayliss, a senior official from the British Ministry of Food, who will pay special attention to studying the export of Chinese food; Delegate Busteed, an electrical engineering expert, is currently the Export Manager of the British Electrical and Allied Manufacturers Association. Last year, when the delegation of the Resources Committee of our country went to the United Kingdom for investigation, he was responsible for liaison; Delegate Morgan, director of William HALE & Sons, represents the general industrial sector of the United Kingdom; Delegate Camigao, a member of the Copper Development Association Council, and Delegate Scothern, director of famous company Torman & Co., represent the British metal industry; Delegate Hanworth represents general British exports, and Delegate Wimbledon is a textile industry expert. In addition, there are experts from the British Trade Association, Mr. Tanton, and delegation secretary Mr. Pellicer, who served as the private secretary of Minister of Commerce Cripps for many years. In addition to the ten people, the delegation also has two female assistant secretaries, namely Miss Lawrance and Miss Morison.

Looking at this list, we can know that the figures included in the delegation represent all sectors such as transportation, electrical industry, metal industry, textile industry, and import and export trade. Then, the importance of this mission representing the country can be imagined.

### Wang Manyun's Trial Concluded; Claimed that Serving the Puppet Regime was "Beneficial to the Country"; Puppet Ambassador Chen Jicheng to Be Sentenced Today

[Our Own Dispatch] The case of Chen Jicheng, who served as puppet ambassador to Manchuria, chairman of the puppet Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and chairman of the puppet Border Affairs Committee, has been concluded by the High Court and is scheduled to be sentenced at 2:30 PM today.

[Another Dispatch] The case of Wang Manyun, suspected of being a traitor, was concluded by the High Court yesterday and is scheduled to be sentenced at 2:30 PM on the 15th of this month.

Wang was formerly the principal of Shanghai Pudong Municipal School. He started serving the puppet regime in August of the 28th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1939] and served as Deputy Minister of the Puppet Ministry of Social Affairs, Permanent Vice Minister of the Puppet Ministry of Judicial Administration, Permanent Vice Minister of the Puppet Ministry of Agriculture and Mining, Deputy Secretary-General of the Puppet Rural Clearance Committee, and Director of the Puppet Executive Yuan Rural Clearance Affairs Bureau until the end of the war. The prosecutor's indictment charged Wang with organizing the masses to resist the central government while serving as Deputy Minister of the Puppet Ministry of Social Affairs; increasing production to provide supplies to the enemy while serving as Vice Minister of the Puppet Ministry of Agriculture; and being responsible for eliminating our underground workers while serving as Deputy Secretary-General of the Puppet Rural Clearance Committee and Director of the Puppet Rural Clearance Affairs Bureau. In summary, his actions should be punished according to law.

Wang, wearing a blue silk padded robe and black satin shoes, argued eloquently in court yesterday: "In the 28th year of the Republic [1939], Mr. Du Yuesheng wrote to me, instructing me to send someone to infiltrate the puppet organization. However, because there was no one to send at the time, I volunteered to join the puppet government, so my motivation was very pure and completely based on a patriotic standpoint. When I joined the puppet government as Deputy Minister of the Puppet Ministry of Social Affairs, there were no masses to organize. During my tenure as Vice Minister of the Puppet Ministry of Judicial Administration, all I did were routine official duties and I did not often go to the ministry to work. When I was Vice Minister of the Puppet Ministry of Agriculture and Mining, the country was devastated, and there was only one farm for experimentation. The food supply was handled by a separate Food Committee, so there was no question of increasing production to provide supplies to the enemy. The Deputy Secretary-General of the Puppet Rural Clearance Committee was just that, a deputy secretary-general. All I did on a daily basis was secretarial work, and I did not know about how the rural clearance work was initiated. At that time, the military was in charge of the enemy, and the administration was in charge of the puppet regime, but the puppet government at the time was anti-communist, so the administrative work of rural clearance was also based on this. The Rural Clearance Affairs Bureau was an internal agency of the puppet Executive Yuan, not a subordinate agency, so it had no seal or official stamp. As the name suggests, the director was responsible for administrative matters. If I was responsible for eliminating underground workers as the prosecutor stated, then it should be called the Rural Clearance Bureau, not the Rural Clearance Affairs Bureau. The rural clearance work in each province was the sole responsibility of the Rural Clearance Commissioners in each province. Therefore, my participation in the puppet government was partly based on orders and partly on my own

Desire for Recognition

I wanted to do something for the country. There was no intention of colluding with the enemy at all. The work I did in a positive way after taking up a puppet position can be divided into as many as nine items, such as providing intelligence. Mr. Wu Kaixian testified to the court last time that 'He told me to pass it on to the central government. Unless it wasn't sent, everything that was sent was accurate.' Therefore, it can be said that the reason why the central government's underground workers have not been threatened in recent years is entirely due to the power of the defendant's intelligence. Other examples include dividing Li Shiqun and Ding Mocun, causing them to suspect and be jealous of each other, which made underground work much easier. Other examples include rescuing Wan Molin, Wu Kaixian, Jiang Bocheng and other important underground workers, all of which have proof. In addition, I escorted Mrs. Du Yuesheng and others to the mainland, prevented others from joining the puppet regime, transported supplies to the interior, participated in defection work, and assisted in maintaining public order after the victory. Based on all these facts, there was only collusion with my own country to conspire against the enemy country. The defendant once used the alias 'Those who can and cannot,' which means that the body can be humiliated, but the will cannot be moved; the family can be destroyed, but the country cannot be lost. Therefore, I feel that I have done nothing to be ashamed of the country." The two lawyers, Chen Junrui and Jiang Rong, defended him, saying: "After the Songhu Anti-Japanese War, the defendant participated in confidential work and then went to Chongqing and Hong Kong. But why did he return to Shanghai? This part of the story has been explained by Mr. Du Yuesheng in court last time. Now, studying the inside story of the general cases of suspected traitors, it can be divided into two categories. One is to do it for a reason, that is, to be entrusted with a mission by the central government and to join the puppet government. The other is to do it for no reason, that is, to willingly surrender without any mission. The defendant in this case did it for a reason, so the court should investigate clearly."

### Sha Yunde and Wang Shuxun to Be Sentenced on the 15th

The cases of Sha Yunde and Wang Shuxun, also suspected of being traitors, were concluded on the same day and are scheduled to be sentenced on the morning of the 15th of this month.

### Sugar Distribution for Public School Personnel; Scheduled Pick-Up Dates

[Our Own Dispatch] The second distribution of raw cane sugar by the Public School Personnel Goods Distribution Office in the city ended on the 5th of this month. Yesterday, according to the director of the office, Yin Tiyang, the procedures for the office to pay the Taiwan Sugar Corporation for the goods have been completed. The office will start issuing the goods on the basis of the delivery order at 9:00 AM on the 12th of this month. Because there are a large number of people who are eligible to purchase the sugar, in order to avoid overcrowding, the dates of pick-up are arranged according to the time of payment. Each organization is requested to send personnel to the temporary warehouse of the office at 184 Maho Road to pick up the goods. Those who purchase less than 100 kilograms must provide their own cloth bags. The pick-up date schedule is as follows:

### Seeking to Resolve Unemployment Panic: Public Works Projects Recommended - Zhao Zengjue's Views on Eliminating Rickshaws

[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the gradual elimination of rickshaws in the city, a reporter visited Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Bureau of Public Utilities, yesterday. According to Zhao, from the perspective of the trend of the times and in terms of efficiency, the elimination of rickshaws is inevitable. Zhao cited an example, stating that an ordinary rickshaw is about three meters long and one meter wide, occupying an area of three square meters. Traveling from the "Throwing Ball Field" to the Bund takes about fifteen minutes, with an efficiency of forty-five square meter-minutes. In contrast, a person on a tram occupies only one square meter, and traveling from the "Throwing Ball Field" to the Bund takes only five minutes, with an efficiency of only five square meter-minutes, a difference of nine times. In terms of municipal construction, public transportation should be promoted to increase efficiency. However, given the current social situation, eliminating rickshaws presents its own difficulties. Public transportation is not yet as ideal as it should be, and the situation in factories is also poor, unable to accommodate a large number of workers. Therefore, the Municipal Affairs Conference has decided to postpone the ban on rickshaws until January of next year. However,

Delivery Dates:

The number of rickshaw pullers using the vehicles will be registered, and in mid-November, a lottery will determine which tenth will be eliminated first. Unemployed rickshaw pullers will be assisted by the Social Affairs Bureau, which will provide small loans to enable them to engage in small businesses. According to Director Zhao, public works projects can be undertaken to absorb unemployed workers and accommodate demobilized soldiers, as the post-war destruction has been severe and all construction projects are awaiting commencement. Moreover, opening factories faces many difficulties with raw materials and machinery, making public works projects easier to implement.

### Unable to Return Home: Request for Temporary Suspension of Prohibition

[Another Report] The Social Affairs Bureau has decided to adopt a lottery system to ban rickshaws in batches. The first batch of tickets drawn, those with the number "5" at the end, will be eliminated, expected to amount to over two thousand six hundred vehicles. The Rickshaw Guild believes that banning rickshaws will inevitably increase the number of unemployed laborers, and that most rickshaw pullers are from northern Jiangsu province, unable to return home. If a ban is implemented, the people of northern Jiangsu will suffer even greater hardship in their lives. Therefore, the guild has been urgently requesting various government agencies and the Shanghai Fundraising Committee of the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association to forward their request to the authorities, asking them to postpone the ban and implement a gradual ban from 1950 to 1953, as decided by the Municipal Council.

### Shui Xiangyun's Opinion: Establish Training Classes

Shui Xiangyun, Chairman of the Federation of Trade Unions, expressed his opinion on the elimination of rickshaws, stating that there are two prerequisites: (1) a proper solution to the re-employment of rickshaw pullers, and (2) dispersing rickshaws from the city to other cities that still need them. Shui suggested establishing re-employment training classes for rickshaw pullers to train them in driving cars and repairing machinery, which could be effective in the short term. If the authorities have not yet prepared proper follow-up measures, he hopes that implementation will be postponed to avoid increasing unemployment and affecting social stability.

### Ministry of Finance Raises Allied Debt in Shanghai: Total Increased to 500 Million

[Report from Our Newspaper] To increase the fundraising for the Allied Victory Public Debt, the Ministry of Finance has sent a telegram to the Shanghai Municipal Government to continue fundraising, stating: "Shanghai is the economic center and commercial hub of the country. During the war, many merchants regretted not being able to subscribe to the various Allied debts issued by the government. Now that we are rebuilding the country after recovery and funds are urgently needed, launching another fundraising campaign for the 30-year Allied Debt in Shanghai will surely attract enthusiastic subscribers. The 80 million yuan already raised is not a large sum and does not seem sufficient to demonstrate their patriotic fervor. The debt amount is now increased to 500 million yuan. In addition to assigning quotas to real estate managers, professionals, and wealthy gentlemen who have not yet been assigned, the various commercial associations that have already been assigned quotas should also have their quotas appropriately increased. Furthermore, in the past, the industrial sector in Shanghai, and especially the workers, always responded first to donation campaigns. Relevant agencies should be consulted to assist in promoting fundraising so that the fundraising campaign can be broadly expanded and achieve significant results." It is reported that the Standing Committee intends to follow the instructions of the Ministry of Finance, consider the actual situation, and adopt three methods: "supplementary assignment," "increased assignment," and "fundraising promotion," inviting heads of municipal commercial associations, responsible persons from various trade associations with strong financial resources, enthusiastic local gentlemen, and leaders from all sectors to enthusiastically subscribe.

### Two Routes Add Direct Beijing-Hangzhou Trains Starting Tomorrow; Beijing-Shanghai Line Adds 28 Services

[Report from Our Newspaper] To alleviate passenger congestion, the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau will add direct Beijing-Hangzhou trains starting tomorrow.

Passenger congestion has suddenly increased in the past week or two due to the peak season.

### Railway Bureau's Restoration Plan to be Completed by February Next Year

[Report from Our Newspaper] Chen Bozhuang, Director of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau, returned to Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago. Chen remained silent about the Railway Bureau case and made no comment. This is because Chen took the initiative to investigate the Railway Bureau case, rather than initiating the investigation after outside informants reported it. Since the case has been handed over to the court and a judgment is expected soon, he does not wish to make any defense.

The restoration plan for the Railway Bureau will be completed by the end of February next year. The main goal is to ensure traffic safety, striving to avoid malfunctions and ensure on-time arrivals. The improvement plan will take about a year, mainly focusing on modernization, adding new equipment, and replacing new sleepers. Currently, the two lines need to replace approximately two to three hundred thousand sleepers.

The mobile clinics of the two lines are currently planning to expand their services to provide medical care to the people of various towns and villages.

### Land Registration Deadline at the End of the Month: All Overdue Registrations to be Nationalized

The Land Bureau has decided that the general land registration for the six districts of Huangpu, Hunan, Zhabei, Fahua, Yinxiang, and Caojing will close at the end of this month. Those who fail to register by the deadline or fail to provide a reason to the bureau will be considered to have abandoned the land and will not be allowed to transfer ownership, freezing their buying responsibilities.

According to Zhu Pingyu, Director of the Land Bureau, the general land registration for the six districts of Huangpu, etc., has been underway for over ten months. According to central regulations, it must be completed within two months. Shanghai, due to its complex environment and to accommodate the difficulties of the people, has repeatedly postponed the deadline. As the delay has been too long from the period stipulated by the central government, it must be concluded. Generally, land in the suburbs has been fully registered with the bureau. Most of the urban areas have also been registered. Only a small portion has not been registered. After the general registration for these six districts is completed, the Land Bureau will begin the general land registration for the Pudong District at the beginning of next year.

### Traffic Improvement in Central District: Reduced Vehicle Violations

### Farewell Party for the Executive Yuan Colleagues: Saying Goodbye to Director Jiang Tingfu; Jiang Announces Decision to Return to School after the Party; Continued Personnel Changes in the Executive Yuan

[Report from Our Newspaper] All colleagues of the Executive Yuan held a cocktail party at the Yiyuan Hotel last night to bid farewell to the recently retired Jiang Tingfu. They presented Jiang with a large silver cup over two feet high and one foot in diameter, engraved with the words "Tang Yin Huan Yu," as well as a hand scroll, to express their remembrance. Nearly a thousand people attended, and the atmosphere was extremely warm.

First, Executive Director Liu Hongsheng delivered a speech on behalf of his colleagues, expressing his deep sorrow at the farewell. Then, General Egerton, Director of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) office in China, delivered a speech, humbly stating that he had only recently arrived and had limited knowledge of relief work, but he greatly admired Director Jiang's work ethic. Next, Ms. Price of the American Relief Mission to China delivered a speech, also praising Jiang's work.

Subsequently, Jiang delivered a reply amidst warm applause from the entire venue, stating that he was truly unworthy of the grand farewell and gifts given by everyone. The work of the Executive Yuan is difficult, and all of you have come with a spirit of service, not hesitating to make various sacrifices. He would like to express his deep gratitude here. The Executive Yuan has no bureaucratic habits, and those who want to become officials will definitely not come to the Executive Yuan.

Jiang repeatedly urged his colleagues not to have a sense of sadness. "While it cannot be said to be based on any evidence that the Chinese nation is the most outstanding in the world, we should not belittle ourselves. Seeing the efforts of all of you working in the Executive Yuan, I can only feel inspired."

Jiang emphasized the importance of the Executive Yuan's work, saying, "If our work succeeds, countless compatriots' lives can be saved. Conversely, if our work is neglected or relaxed, tens of millions of compatriots will perish in ravines!"

After Jiang's speech, many people rushed forward to shake hands with Jiang and express their farewells. When asked about his plans, Jiang said that he planned to take a two-month break first, and then make a decision, stating in a firm and definite tone: "I have decided to return to school."

As for the personnel of the Executive Yuan, Deputy Director Pu Xuefeng's resignation has been approved and Zheng Daoru will succeed him; Deputy Director Li Chemin's intention to resign remains firm, only agreeing to "stay for a few weeks." It is said that Wu Bannong has been internally designated as his successor. Director Huo also announced yesterday that Lu Hanqin will be the director of the Secretariat and Wu Guanxiong will be the secretary. More announcements are expected in the coming days. Furthermore, Director Huo is scheduled to hold his first press conference after taking office at the Duchen Hotel at 3 p.m. today.

[Nanjing, 8th] Pu Xuefeng, the Deputy Director of the Executive Yuan who recently resigned along with Jiang Tingfu, said: Tsinghua and other schools have recently sent telegrams inviting him to teach, but as he is suffering from a minor illness, he plans to rest briefly. He is not expected to leave Beijing in the short term. As for future writing plans, he may start writing again when he returns to school to teach in the future.

### Highway Transport Team Reorganized: Jointly Operated by the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Transportation

The Executive Yuan Highway Transport Team has recently been reorganized and is jointly operated by the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Transportation. After the reorganization, the general manager has been officially announced as Lu Zhenxuan, and the assistant manager will be Ma Niluo, the former acting general manager of the team.

The Shanghai team has one assembly plant, and two more are located in Kowloon and Qingdao. The team currently has 1,230 trucks. In the past nine months, the team's vehicles have traveled more than 2.5 million miles. In September alone, over 600,000 tons of relief supplies were transported.

In the past, the average monthly transport of commercial goods was 5,000 tons. In the future, the operating income surplus will be divided equally between the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Transportation, and the losses will be shared by both parties.

### Social Affairs Bureau Stabilizes Flour Prices: Calls Representatives from Flour Mills for Talks

To stabilize flour prices, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has adopted measures to limit flour prices and has achieved considerable success. To continue to stabilize flour prices, the bureau convened representatives from flour mills for talks at 3 p.m. yesterday. Qian Shouchun from the Fuxin Flour Mill and Xi Debing from the Fufeng Flour Mill attended. Ji Mingzhai, Chief of the Grain Section of the bureau, presided over the meeting.

### Evaluation of Woolen Yarn Prices: Review Meeting Held Yesterday

To equalize woolen yarn prices, the Social Affairs Bureau organized a Woolen Yarn Price Review Committee and held its first inaugural meeting at 3 p.m. yesterday. The committee included representatives from the competent authorities, commercial and industrial groups, and public opinion organizations. Its task is to review and determine reasonable woolen yarn prices based on the cost of goods and with reference to the Shanghai market. This price is limited to wholesale within the industry. If wholesale prices within the industry exceed the negotiated price, the committee will recommend that the municipal government take necessary action. Those who attended yesterday included Pan Shihao, representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Chen Qien, representative of the Woolen Textile Dyeing Industry Association, Shen Laizhou, Sun Guizhou, Zhang Yiping, representatives of the Woolen Yarn Commercial Association, Tang Hexiang, representative of the Binfeng Woolen Mill, Deng Zhonghe, representative of the Anle Textile Mill, Li Runsheng, representative of the Yumin Woolen Yarn Mill, and Zhu Jixiang, representative of the Ewo Textile Co., Ltd., and other personnel totaling more than ten people. Gu Bingyuan, Director of the Economic Administration Division of the Social Affairs Bureau, presided over the meeting.

Manufacturers State Their Difficulties

First, the manufacturers stated their current difficulties: (1) the source of raw materials is not smooth, and wool must be supplied from foreign countries, with no standard price. (2) The cost is rising, the cost of living is rising in a straight line, wage expenses are huge, interest rates are too high, and there is a lack of working capital. (3) Electricity is limited. The total electricity consumption for woolen yarn production is only 761 kW, so they requested that the restrictions be lifted. (4) The loss of machinery during the wartime occupation has not yet been restored, and the production of various factories has shrunk, less than one-tenth of what it was before the war.

Conduct Preliminary Investigation Before Setting Prices

Distributors said that they suffered heavy losses from the enemy's price control policy during the occupation period. After the victory, they were affected by the currency system, and they sacrificed even more due to Commander-in-Chief He's efforts to stabilize commodity prices on September 28 of last year. Therefore, they requested that no rigid price limits be imposed. Currently, the threat to the industry is the lack of inventory and the lack of smooth sources, followed by the temporary stores that speculate temporarily, affecting the industry's operations.

Later, Director Gu explained the price negotiation system, stating that it was not a rigid price limit, and studied the investigation matters. It was determined that the meeting would be held once every two weeks, and prices would be negotiated at the next meeting.

In addition, the Cotton Cloth Price Review Committee organized by the bureau is scheduled to be established this afternoon.

### False Alarm Triggered at Rong's Residence: Caused a Scare

[Report from Our Newspaper] Rong Hongqing, the nephew of Rong Desheng, resides at 186 Seymour Road. At around 3 p.m. yesterday, someone accidentally triggered the alarm bell.

### Garrison Headquarters Improves Reception of Reporters: Three Measures Agreed Upon

Twenty-three reporters from various newspapers in Shanghai, citing the inconvenience for reporters to conduct interviews for military news at the Garrison Headquarters, jointly sent an open letter to Commander Xuan a few days ago, requesting facilitation of interviews to achieve the purpose of freedom of the press. Commander Xuan immediately replied publicly, publishing it in various newspapers in Shanghai yesterday. The reporters felt that Commander Xuan's reply contained many misunderstandings of the reporters' intentions, and the requests made were not accepted, expressing dissatisfaction. They held another meeting yesterday and immediately drafted a reply to Commander Xuan, sending it to various newspapers for publication today. Feng Youzhen, the representative of the Central Propaganda Department stationed in Shanghai, heard about this and attached great importance to it. Feng believed that the Garrison Headquarters originally had no intention of deliberately creating difficulties for reporters interviewing the department's news. However, the various inconveniences encountered by reporters when interviewing the department's news were indeed true. The main reason was that the communication between the department's staff and reporters was not close enough, and the methods of releasing news were lacking in technical aspects. These shortcomings can be easily improved through consultation. Therefore, he stepped in to mediate. With the consent of the Garrison Headquarters, the department will provide as much convenience as possible for reporters from various newspapers to interview the department's news in the future, and three measures were agreed upon: (1) The department will distribute passes to reporters from various newspapers who cover military news. (2) Reporters from various newspapers can enter the reception rooms of various departments of the department. (3) The guards at the gate will be strictly ordered to improve their attitude towards reporters. The reporters expressed satisfaction with the Garrison Headquarters' measures and unanimously decided not to publish the reply to Commander Xuan, which was originally scheduled to be published today.

### Renji Hospital Raises Funds: Yan Huiquing Hosted a Gathering Yesterday with a Goal of 200 Million Yuan, Already Obtaining 80 Million

[Our Reporter] The Renji Hospital of this city, founded to this day, has a history of over a hundred years, and for many years, British individuals have held primary responsibility. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the board of directors was reorganized, with Chinese individuals holding sixteen seats and British individuals holding nine seats, with Dr. Yan Huiqing serving as chairman of the board. Yesterday (the 8th) at 5 PM, Dr. Yan invited representatives from all sectors of the city at the International Hotel's second floor to discuss matters related to raising funds for the hospital. Attendees included Mayor Wu Guozhen, City Council Speaker Pan Gongzhan, Jiangsu Inspector Cheng Cangbo, Deputy General of the Customs Service Ding Guitang, Director of the Finance Bureau Gu Chunfan, Director of the Health Bureau Zhang Wei, as well as prominent figures Dong Yinzhang, Cui Pingxi, Lu Meiseng, Xu Zhendong, Wang Qiyu, Sun Duanhuang, Zhan Peilin, Zhao Jinqing, Wu Weijing, Tang Xinghai, Xu Xiekang, Wu Yiran, and foreign guests, totaling approximately fifty people. First, Chairman Yan of the hospital reported on the process of reorganization and the current situation, praising the hospital as the earliest founded hospital in China. He noted that most good hospitals cannot be self-sufficient because their purpose is to help the poor, so he hoped that all sectors would actively contribute to the funding.

Mayor Wu then expressed his views, praising the reorganization of the hospital's board of directors, stating that this was in accordance with the new regulations set by the central government, requiring that both the chairman of the board and the hospital director be Chinese. However, he emphasized that rights and obligations must go hand in hand, and that in the past, Renji Hospital was managed by foreigners who were responsible for raising funds. Now that the hospital has been taken over by us, we should naturally fulfill our obligations. He added that all those present were known for their generosity, and he hoped that they would all provide assistance so that Dr. Yan's wishes could be realized as scheduled.

### Elliston Reports on History

Following Mayor Wu's speech, which ended with applause, Dr. E.S. Elliston, the British representative on the hospital board, reported on the history of the hospital, stating that Renji Hospital was founded in 1844, and its first fundraising effort took place in 1846, exactly one hundred years ago. At that time, the donation amount that the major benefactors were responsible for was five silver dollars per year. In 1850, the total annual expenses of the hospital were 533 yuan, which jumped to 750 yuan two years later. The founder of Renji Hospital was Dr. Lockhart, a British man who purchased a small plot of land between Fujian Road and Shandong Road and built a thatched house, single-handedly treating Chinese and foreign patients. Later, due to the small size of the house, it needed to be expanded (near Fujian Road, i.e., the current site), and a new building was constructed at a cost of 3,500 yuan. At that time, the total amount of donations from all sectors was only over 2,000 yuan, and the missing 1,000 yuan was borrowed from a bank at an interest rate of six percent. The total cost of moving from the old site to the new site was 13 yuan in legal tender. Since then, the hospital has been in deficit every year. However, Dr. Elliston said that every reasonable hospital will inevitably be in deficit. Hospitals that truly serve the people will never deposit money in the bank. And the best hospital directors are never those who sit idly in their offices all day! Dr. Elliston concluded by saying that the reason he listed all the past events was to arouse everyone's interest in the hospital and provide assistance. The British have created a hundred years of history for Renji Hospital. After the Chinese take over, he hoped that the future of Renji Hospital would be even more brilliant.

It is reported that the fundraising goal of Renji Hospital this time is 200 million yuan, of which about 80 million yuan has been raised. Rong Hongyuan, the nephew of Rong Desheng, has contributed the largest amount, 50 million yuan. Dr. Yan distributed many donation books at yesterday's meeting and is confident that the full amount will be raised soon.

### Forging Documents to Steal Coal: A Flaw Was Revealed During Transportation

[Our Reporter] At approximately 4 PM on the 6th, the Xinshijie Precinct of the Municipal Police Bureau intercepted two trucks transporting stolen coal. The trucks were loaded with ten tons of coal. A man claiming to be a soldier, carrying forged identification, escorted the trucks. As they were passing Sanmin Road at the intersection of the Athletic Association Road, they were intercepted by the local substation for inspection. The man jumped out of the truck, claiming to be Zhu Jiakui (27 years old, from Shaoxing), a lieutenant serving in the General Office of the Logistics Headquarters. Zhu claimed that the coal was for the military and should not be interfered with. Officer Guo politely replied that he was under orders to inspect. Zhu Jiakui unhesitatingly reached into his pocket and produced a piece of identification. Officer Guo examined it for a long time and noticed that the title of Zhu on the card and the identification did not match. Realizing that it was forged, he questioned him severely. Zhu stammered, showing signs of guilt, and turned to flee. He hastily jumped onto the front truck and sped away. The truck behind also accelerated and followed. At this time, the police officers were convinced that they were transporting stolen coal and quickly pursued them on bicycles to near Hongkou Park, where they managed to intercept the rear coal truck (number 35622) and apprehended two plainclothes men. Zhu escaped in the front truck. The truck and the two men were taken to the precinct for interrogation, where the precinct chief, Ni Huanan, personally questioned them. According to the two suspects, the two trucks they hired were rented from the Yiyuan Transportation Company. They claimed to be only responsible for transportation, loading the goods from Jiangwan First Warehouse and transporting them to Zhu's residence at Lane 632, No. 792 Kangding Road in Huxi. They claimed to know nothing else. Based on this clue, the head of the criminal division, Wang Haozai, along with officers Cui Yifan, Zheng Jingcheng, Wang Zhigang, and Lü Wenxuan, were immediately dispatched to the above location to stake out. Zhu returned to his residence at around 6 AM the next morning and was arrested and taken to the precinct for questioning. At first, he tried to pass the blame onto the two men, claiming that he was just helping them transport the goods and that they were the ones who claimed to be soldiers. However, when questioned about the forged documents, Zhu was at a loss for words and confessed to the theft. The precinct is currently compiling the record of the interrogation and plans to hand over the entire case and the suspects to the preparatory department for handling this morning.

### Answering Readers: Legal Questions

(1) Refusing to Accept Rent

Yang Chuheng asks: I previously rented a house from a certain property management office. The lease was due to expire at the end of June this year, and I had discussed renewal procedures with the property management office at that time. However, the property management office stated that continuing the lease would require an increase in rent and the payment of a large handling fee, to which I did not agree. The office has now refused to accept rent for two months. I have several questions and would be grateful for your guidance: (1) Does my inability to pay the large handling fee constitute a waiver of my leasehold rights? Can the property management office terminate the lease on this basis? (2) Can I deposit the refused rent in a bank on their behalf? (3) In the absence of a lease agreement stating otherwise, does the original lessee have the right to continue the lease? (4) If the rent continues to be refused, what should I do according to the law? (5) If the property management office disregards everything and forces me to move out, are there any legal remedies or protections available?

[Lawyer Qin Liankui's Answer] (1) If a fixed-term lease agreement expires and the lessor has negotiated terms with the lessee, it is clear that the lessor is willing to continue the lease. The municipal government has set standards for rent, so the term of the lease is the only key point of negotiation between the two parties. The so-called handling fee should not be a large sum, and should not be used as a condition for lease if it is a disguised form of key money? However, before a new lease is signed, the lessor may deny the lessee's right to lease on the grounds that the old lease relationship has been terminated and the new lease relationship has not been established. (2) The method of depositing in a bank is now very common, and its effect is to prove that you are not neglecting your obligation to pay. (3) If the lease agreement does not contain any records of being able to continue the lease after the expiration date, you cannot simply rely on the lease agreement to claim the right to continue the lease. (4) If forced eviction occurs, and the act violates criminal law, you can file a private prosecution according to the private prosecution procedure.

### City Chamber of Commerce Cables the Executive Yuan to Exempt Native Cloth from Business Tax: No Loss to Tax Revenue, Beneficial to Sales

[Our Report] The City Chamber of Commerce cabled the Executive Yuan requesting the exemption of native cloth from business tax, stating: "According to a letter from the Local Cloth Business Association of this city: Native cloth is originally the only sideline of farmers and is also a unique domestic product of our people. It is woven by women and mostly worn by poor people. Both supply and demand sides belong to the poor class, so the business tax on artificial hand-woven native cloth has always been reduced or exempted. As far back as the warlord era, although donations and taxes were heavy, native cloth was once exempted from likin. In recent times, such as the enemy puppet era, although extortion was rampant, native cloth was also spared harsh harassment. In the 17th year of the Republic of China, when the national government established its capital in Nanjing, it issued an order to the whole country to permanently exempt native cloth from likin tax. In the 21st year of the Republic of China, after deliberation by the Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan issued an order to all provinces and cities to exempt native cloth from business tax. The clear orders have become a fixed case. The government's intention to promote domestic goods and protect people's livelihood can be seen. The pain that cloth merchants are suffering is waiting to be resolved, but the unexpected burden of cloth merchants has suddenly revived. Despite repeated orders, permanent exemptions, and uniform exemptions from business tax on native cloth, the tax is being levied again. Although the Taihui has repeatedly petitioned, it has not yet been approved. The industry is in a panic, and they tell each other in distress. It is feared that cloth merchants will eventually affect the weavers. Both production and sales will inevitably perish together. After the catastrophe, people's livelihood is urgent. We beg your council to forward to the Executive Yuan for approval to investigate the established case and permanently exempt, etc. to the meeting. Native cloth is coarse yarn hand-woven, the scale is narrower, and is durable, is a rural side industry. The native cloth industry before the war was exempted by your court in previous orders. Article 41 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Business Tax Law promulgated by your court at its 579th meeting on January 19, 32nd year of the Republic of China, stipulates: "After the implementation of the Business Tax Law and these Detailed Rules, all provincial business tax separate regulations and the Ministry of Finance and various provinces previously approved for reduction, exemption, and deferral of business tax shall be abolished." From then on, the established case of native cloth exemption from business tax was also abolished. Paying taxes according to the rate is due to the fact that military needs were urgent during the war, and fundraising was in full swing, so we had to broaden the tax collection path. Now that the War of Resistance has ended for more than a year, the business tax, which was classified as centrally managed at that time, has been transferred to the local government for management in accordance with the revised financial revenue and expenditure system. Regarding the established case of native cloth exemption from tax before the war: we propose that your court still approve the recovery by explicit order. This matter will not harm the central government's tax revenue, but will benefit the sale of native cloth. The rural areas after the war are devastated, and the vitality has not recovered. Reducing the burden of native cloth will indirectly protect the livelihood of rural areas. We only hope that you will adopt our humble suggestions and implement them resolutely."

### US Dollar Transactions Still Unclear

Foreign currency, the US dollar, is stable and the British pound is strong, not deviating from the old path of the previous day. The exchange rate for US dollars is still shouted at 3,500 yuan to 3,530 yuan, but transactions can only be completed after the sellers receive income, so it is still a situation of having a price but no market. The off-market black market price is still between 4,000 yuan and 4,100 yuan, which is also relatively sluggish. The result is similar to the previous day. Hong Kong dollars are also extremely stable, struggling at the previous price without any gains or losses. The Hong Kong exchange rate has risen slightly due to the return of telegrams from Shanghai, and was sold at 925 yuan yesterday. The Indian exchange rate is 1,100 to 1,130 yuan, and the British exchange rate is 14,500 yuan to 15,000 yuan. Transactions are still difficult to develop. The official exchange rate for the US dollar has not changed, but direct trading is still unheard of.

### Large Difference Between Hong Kong and Shanghai Prices: More Buyers in the Gold Market, Resulting in a Rebound to 5.3 Million

Yesterday, the price of gold first weakened and then stabilized. There were signs of easing in the money market, coupled with the payment of taxes by the Guangbang, which led to this. The initial price was around 2.16 million, with a large number of offers, and it was once seen at 2.155 million, but it soon stabilized and rose slightly. After 10 o'clock, the central bank sold 100 bars at a price of 2.165 million. There were no major changes after this. Later, due to the easing of the money market and the large difference between the Hong Kong and Shanghai gold prices, there were slightly more buyers. Around noon, the price rebounded to 2.195 million before being pressured and weakened slightly. At noon, it stood at around 2.185 million. In the afternoon, the buying interest was strong again, and the overnight transaction price rose to 2.22 million, resulting in a rebound of 53,000. Ornamental gold was 234,000, silver was 3,400, silver dollars were unchanged, and the underground short-term money market was slightly relaxed, but the underground interest rate still needed 1.6 to 2 cents.

### Public Bonds Pulled Up Again: Unified Class C Rose Well by 320

Yesterday, the price of public bonds stabilized again. General financial buyers continued to pay, but there were not many chips, and it was easy to pull up the price. Unified Class C opened at 1,900 yuan. After continuous absorption by scattered buyers, the price rose well to 2,330 yuan before slightly turning. Finally, it hovered around 2,250 yuan. The result was a rise of 320 yuan compared to the previous closing. Class A and B continued to rise by 150 yuan, and Class D and E rose well by 100 yuan. The transaction volume was about 6 million yuan in face value.

### Foreign Stocks Rose and Fell Unevenly

The situation of foreign stocks changed, and the rise and fall of each stock were uneven and different. Ewo Yarns was the most stable, rising from 9,800 yuan to the 10,000 yuan mark. As a result, Ewo Yarns rose by half a percentage point compared to the previous close. British United Paper and Shipping rose. Jardine Matheson and Guangmao were average. Cold stocks were quite popular and relatively lively.

### Silk Was Sluggish

Although the factory's purchase price has requested an increase, the foreign firms and real sales accounts were very sluggish, so those who urgently wanted to sell had to depreciate the price. Yesterday, the city's various stalls were short of 50,000 to more than 100,000 yuan. The market price of silk goods was frustrated due to the weakness of raw materials. The real silk goods were even weaker. Yesterday, the artificial silk goods still maintained the original price of the previous day.

### Knitted Goods Sold to Southeast Asia: The Industry is Preparing

The knitted industry in this city is stepping up production recently due to the approaching winter. In addition to adding new machinery, each factory is also planning to develop sales in Southeast Asia. Some manufacturers have gone to Hong Kong to set up offices in preparation for export. Before the war, the average monthly production of the knitted industry in this city was 300,000 dozen, of which 170,000 dozen were sold in Southeast Asia, exceeding the number in the country, so the industry is preparing to promote trade in Southeast Asia.

### Tunxi Tea Approved for Borrowing Freight

The China Farmers Bank has approved the request of tea merchants in southern Anhui to borrow tea refining loans in accordance with the Pingshui District method. However, Qimen tea has already been packed into boxes, and the funds of manufacturers are concentrated on the tea itself. The transportation costs cannot be raised at present. The China Farmers Bank has also agreed to consider lending freight costs of 10,000 yuan per load. As of recently, the number of tea houses applying for loans is 16 in the Pingshui District, totaling 1.2 billion yuan, and 20 in the Tunxi District, totaling 500 million yuan. The funds for Pingshui will be issued this week, and the funds for Tunxi may be remitted before the 20th of this month.

### A Large Amount of Vietnamese Rice Will Arrive

[Our Report] In August, 5,000 tons of Vietnamese rice arrived in Shanghai. There were no imports in September. According to the confirmed news from the French Postal Shipping Company, a large amount will arrive in Shanghai this month. The first ship, the Panchini Yutipi Haini, loaded 3,700 tons of rice from Saigon at the end of last month and set sail for Shanghai. It is expected to arrive at the port today or tomorrow. The rice was also purchased by the Central Trust Bureau.

### New Textile Fiber Invented by British Scientists

[British News Agency, London, 8th] Britain has recently invented a new type of textile fiber, which is different from other natural and artificial fibers. It is named "Terylene." Its ingredients are obtained from chemicals. The material is strong and has special heat resistance and is easy to spin into knitting. Terylene is the result of the research of scientists at the Manchester Calico Printing Association Research Institute. The association has handed over the invention to the British Imperial Chemical Industries Co., Ltd. to improve it and sell it to the market. It is said that preliminary work is currently being carried out in the laboratory. A large amount of production will take a considerable amount of time.

### Money is Still Tight: Yarn and Cloth Have Not Escaped the Slump: Fangjian's Opening Cloth is Also Cheaper Than the Previous Period

Yesterday, the yarn market turned stable. In the early morning, it continued the downward trend of the previous day and continued to fall by 50,000 yuan. Then, the Hakka helped take advantage of the cheap absorption, so it was able to stop falling and rebound. The gains and losses of 20-count and 16-count yarn were mixed, roughly the same as the previous day. 42-count thread was about 60,000 to 70,000 yuan lower. 42-count Blue Phoenix spot goods were 3.08 million yuan, futures were 3 million yuan. 20-count Double Horse was 2.04 million yuan, and heavyweight was 2.12 million yuan. Because the money is still tight, although the supply of joint sales is not large, the price is still weak and unable to rise. In this situation, I am afraid that there is no hope of recovery before the National Day commemoration. The cloth market is becoming increasingly unreal, and the price is also falling more and more. Today is also the opening sales period of Fangjian, and the listed prices are cheaper than the previous period. Applicants for purchase are not enthusiastic, which is due to the fact that this street and the Hakka sales are still sluggish, and the money is extremely tight, so they cannot move forward, and the price is also falling frequently. Yesterday, the market price of Longxian fine cloth was 84,000 yuan, Yanghe and 3A Caqiu fine cloth was 78,000 to 79,000 yuan, and Four Gentlemen Yuan Bijia was 88,000 yuan. The price of fine cloth in various stalls has generally fallen by about 120,000 yuan compared to the peak.

Shu Yinzhang, general manager of Fangjian Company, convened a work review meeting of the persons in charge of Fangjian factories under his control at 3 pm yesterday to strengthen production work. There was a detailed discussion on the issues of strengthening management and increasing productivity. It was not until around 6 pm that the meeting dispersed.

### Reduce Dock Theft: Police Bureau Plans to Form Volunteer Police

In order to eliminate dock theft, the Municipal Police Bureau specifically convened the persons in charge of the Import and Export Industry Association, the Shipping Industry Association, and the Stevedoring Industry Association at the bureau at 2 pm yesterday to discuss the method of forming a volunteer police force.

### Hong Kong Export Restrictions: Part Has Been Canceled

[Reuters, Hong Kong, 7th] The Hong Kong government has announced the cancellation of restrictions on a variety of export goods, which is the prelude to the restoration of normal trade relations between Hong Kong and South China. Although the quantity and importance of freely exported goods are not very large, businessmen generally welcome the government's announcement and the true recognition that Hong Kong's trade must develop. Hong Kong's prosperity has always been closely related to South China's trade, but since the liberation of Hong Kong, it has been difficult to develop due to various restrictions imposed by governments. The following goods are still prohibited from export: grain, cotton yarn, piece goods, alkali, glass plates, auto parts, refrigerators, rubber, wood, newsprint, and printing materials. However, the following items are excluded: (1) Newsprint, glass (weighing no more than 18 ounces), and coconut oil, which are designated as a portion of all imported goods for export, (2) Piece goods that have been withdrawn from the warehouse by the Chief of Supplies.

### Woolen Cloth is Stable

Yesterday, the Hakka sales of woolen cloth were more relaxed, but the needs of various weaving factories on this street were still not weak. The trend of each cargo, except for Melton herringbone artificial cotton and silk grass green gabardine, etc., has slightly turned flat and weak. The rest have always been stable. The news of buying full wool suit flannel and overcoat flannel is even stronger. The industry is very optimistic because the arrival of goods is scarce, and the circulation of goods in the market is thin. Those who do not use high-interest loans are easily unwilling to sell.

### Rice Prices Are Flat, Grain and Oil are Sluggish: Hetao Rice Boats Resumed Receiving Rice Yesterday

The digestion of the rice market has turned sluggish. The registration of Hakka goods was more than 6,700 stones. Indica rice continued to fall by more than 1,000 yuan. Although the source of japonica rice is small, the people's hearts are also softening. Baiyuan's arrival and digestion are both flat, and the market situation is established. Yinyuan increased the killing. Yesterday, Hetao rice boats began to resume receiving rice and the authorities sent police to assist in preventing labor conflicts. The flour mills are limited to shipping goods per day, and the black market is no longer easy to operate. Wheat is in a slump and has not been opened. Bran's rise and fall are mutual. Small packages have returned to a slight fatigue of 100 to 200 yuan. Scattered warehouses are slightly firm by more than 100 yuan. Bean cakes have few transactions in both foreign ports and on this street, returning to a slight 200 to 300 yuan. The supply of soybean oil and rapeseed oil from the factory in the oil market is gradually increasing, and the source of raw oil on the market is seeing prosperity, and it continues to fall by more than 1,000 yuan. The sales of soybeans are also weak, falling by 1,000 yuan. Broad beans have also returned slightly by 1,000 yuan. Broad beans are temporarily lacking in gains and losses. Red grain wineries have reduced their intake, returning to a slight 500 to 600 yuan. Raw kernels have fallen and stabilized, but as soon as the goods arrive, they still have to be small.

### Wheat Trading: Grain Merchants Request Preservation

The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, in order to prevent wheat transactions from entering the right track recently, and the mutual buying and selling between firms to promote speculation and raise prices, ordered the Grain Industry Association to strictly prohibit it in order to stabilize the market. However, the grain industry believes that the buying and selling between wheat firms has become a convention. If you want to suppress the rise in wheat, you must prohibit exports. A special emergency meeting was called yesterday to solicit opinions. All said that the source of wheat in the market is purchased and transported to Shanghai by various member firms operating in transportation and sales, and the sales are sold to various flour mills and merchants through various member firms operating in distribution. Over the years, mutual buying and selling between firms has always been a misunderstanding in business. As for cracking down on hoarding, it is a normal measure, but there is no correlation between transactions between firms. If it is necessary to stabilize wheat prices, exports should be prohibited first, not the transactions between firms. They unanimously requested that the actual situation be truthfully reported to the Social Bureau for review and cancellation of the prohibition order. The Association has reported the actual situation to the Social Bureau for review.

### Spot Market Somewhat Eased, Chinese Stocks Improved

Yesterday, rumors spread that the money market for Chinese stocks had eased, causing the market to open higher. After the opening, the situation fluctuated, rising and falling unpredictably. The process was cyclical, and only at 11:05 AM did it begin to improve again. Within that hour, Northern traders were actively buying, but their bids were not high, easily suppressed by sellers outside the market. After 11:00 AM, the tide turned, with Sichuan traders re-entering Xinyi and Meiya, and traders from other regions rushing to bid up prices. By 11:20 AM, all stocks were at their most profitable, with Yong Yarn surpassing the 800 yuan mark, rising to 806 yuan. Meiya reached a high of 4520 yuan before retracting. Unexpectedly, the bulls took the opportunity to close out their positions, and after 11:35 AM, the market weakened again. The supply from outside the market continued unabated, causing panic among the longs. Traders eventually engaged in large-scale selling, and the market closed at its lowest price. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yong Yarn, Meiya, and Jingfu all showed small gains, Xin Guang and Qin Xing remained unchanged, Xinhe alone rose by half a percent, and Tongyi, Zhongfang, Rong, Jinglun, Zhongsheng, and Wuhe saw slight gains. Neiyi Co. and Lian saw slight declines, while Xinya, Huayi, and Cement remained unchanged. Price fluctuations for stocks outside the market were minor.

### Rayon Prices in the Black Market Lack Standards; Manufacturers Are Now Quietly Awaiting Allocations; Citywide Monthly Demand is 2,500 Cases

Yesterday, the rayon market was firm, while factory prices were weak. At 120 Tianqiao, Guangming rayon was quoted at 3.7 million yuan in the morning, and slightly better at 50,000 yuan higher in the afternoon. Other semi-gloss varieties lacked standard prices due to recent off-market transactions. The same brand of goods varied greatly in price, often differing by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. Transactions have been scarce recently, as manufacturers have enough allocated goods to support them. For the time being, they do not need to search for goods in the black market. Two batches of rayon ordered from Japan by the China Trust Bureau have arrived in Shanghai, the first batch of 4,800 cases and the second batch of 6,000 cases, which the China Textile Corporation plans to sell to members of the city's silk weaving industry in batches. According to a recent survey by the industry association, there are a total of 255 member companies in the city, with a monthly demand of 2,500 cases of rayon. A detailed list has been prepared and submitted to the China Textile Corporation for verification.

### Fucheng Creditors' Group Forbids the Company from Transferring Ownership Without Permission

The Fucheng Bank on Sichuan Middle Road previously closed down due to deficits. To manage the liquidation of Fucheng's debts, the creditors organized a creditors' group and posted a notice near the gate of Fucheng Bank, stating that the bank's properties could not be transferred, sold, or transferred to other owners without permission until Fucheng's debts were cleared. At the same time, the creditors scheduled a meeting of the creditors' group at the Sichuan Road Bridge Youth Association cafeteria yesterday afternoon to discuss various matters.

### Cigarette Industry Suggests Increasing Paper Wrapper Tax Rate

The severity of the crisis in the city's cigarette industry is evidenced by the bankruptcy of the Xin Yuan Tobacco Factory, which has over ten years of history and is the largest in scale. The industry is one of China's major industries, accounting for 49% of the city's total commodity tax revenue. Among the 82 cigarette factories in the city, there are more than 30,000 workers, with approximately 100,000 people indirectly dependent on it for their livelihoods. In addition to government loans and tax reductions, preventing the import of foreign cigarettes is also extremely important. At the same time, rampant smuggling of cigarettes on the mainland prevents the sale of local products in the interior. This is because mainland cigarette factories do not pay taxes at a 100% tax rate, and most of their raw materials are smuggled goods, resulting in lower prices. Members of the city's cigarette industry believe that if the government wants to eliminate mainland cigarette smuggling, it only needs to increase the commodity tax on paper wrappers to 100,000 yuan per ream. After purchasing the wrappers, if the factories complete the commodity tax when producing cigarettes, the tax evasion problem in the mainland can be resolved, and legitimate merchants can be protected.

### 11,000 Bags of Peruvian Sugar Arrive in Shanghai

This Tuesday, the Ramon wheel cargo ship carried 11,000 bags of white sugar from Peru in South America, planning to unload them at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou. This batch of foreign sugar was shipped by the American merchant Mellon &amp; Co., which holds an import license for foreign sugar from the Customs Import Management Office and is the first to import. Sugar industry peers attach great importance to it.

### Transactions in Native Sugar Are Not Quiet

Yesterday, the sugar market trend was stable with little fluctuation. The guild's spot market for No. 20 medium-grade white sugar was initially 141,000 yuan, and later 138,000 yuan. Raw sugar (red) was 126,000 to 128,000 yuan. Numbered goods were offered by Shantou dealers with 114,500 yuan for Tiqing, 112,500 yuan for Huanggangqing, 110,000 yuan for Bannanjing, and 113,000 to 114,000 yuan for ordinary cotton red. Xinghua dealers offered 137,000 yuan for Gongfenbai, 99,000 yuan for Xinghuaqing, 132,000 to 133,000 yuan for Xing red, 130,000 yuan for medium grade, and 128,000 yuan for Juezhi. Jianbang opened at 100,850 yuan for Diaojing, totaling over 500 bags.

### World Wheat Harvest This Year's Results Are Quite Good

[Reuters Washington, 7th dispatch] The U.S. Department of Agriculture reports that the 1946 world wheat harvest is approximately 5.9 billion bushels. In quantity, this is the largest since 1940. Europe had the best harvest, estimated at 1.36 billion bushels, an increase of 330 million bushels. The only exception was the British Isles, where the harvest was poor due to bad weather. However, the U.S. Department of Agriculture issued a warning: "Although Europe has a larger wheat harvest, it still needs to rely on imports."

### MacArthur Agrees to Japanese Shipments to China; Still Uses Barter; Saying 500,000 Bags as Compensation Is Not True

According to the person in charge of China Sericulture Corporation: Regarding the shipment of Japanese cocoons to China, MacArthur expressed great enthusiasm for the restoration of China's sericulture industry and shipped a large number of Japanese silkworm seeds and mulberry seedlings to China. Later, because the domestic authorities saw a sharp decline in cocoon production after the war, and due to the reeling by various silk factories, they requested the shipment of Japanese cocoons to China in exchange for goods. MacArthur also agreed, but was later unfortunately blocked by Mr. Magana, an advisor to MacArthur's headquarters. Now MacArthur has agreed to our request to ship Japanese cocoons to China, and it is still handled by means of barter. Therefore, our silk factories will not have to worry about the interruption of raw materials in the future. As for the rumor that 500,000 bags of Japanese cocoons will be shipped to China as compensation for wartime losses, it is not true, and Mr. Shu Yunzhang, general manager of China Textile Corporation, was not commissioned to go to Japan to purchase cocoons.

### Tax Officials Supervise Liquor Production; Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests Alternative Measures

[Report from this newspaper] The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, based on a letter from the Municipal Pharmaceutical Business Association stating that the announcement of the Shanghai Commodity Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance on September 19 has difficulties in implementation and requesting changes, has sent a letter to the bureau for consultation. The original letter stated: "We have learned that the bureau's announcement requires that any modifications to Chinese-made wine must first be submitted for approval and registration, and then verified under supervision to avoid tax evasion. In fact, the Chinese-made wines modified in this city are all transported from other ports and have tax-paid certificates, transfer certificates, and seals affixed to the containers, which are sufficient for inspection along the way, so there is no possibility of leakage. There are thousands of Chinese medicine stores in Shanghai that modify medicinal wines. Their wines are purchased in small quantities from wine merchants at any time. If each modification requires the bureau to send personnel for supervision, it is unlikely that there are enough personnel to dispatch. If it is necessary to arrange dates for each batch, the pharmacies will have to suspend production and wait, which will seriously affect business. Although the bureau has the duty to implement taxation rules, if there are indeed difficulties in implementation, for the convenience of business, it can also report the facts truthfully and request revisions. Correspondingly, we have prepared a letter to the bureau, hoping that the bureau will investigate and handle this matter."

### Insurance Industry Capital Should Be at Least 5 Million

[Report from this newspaper] The National Federation of the insurance industry previously suggested to the central government that the capital amount of insurance companies should be increased to no less than 50 million yuan. It is now learned that the Ministry of Economic Affairs approved this case on the 3rd of this month, stating: "According to Article 6 of the Wartime Insurance Management Regulations, the total capital of the insurance industry shall not be less than 5 million yuan in national currency. The Ministry has no restrictions on companies raising more capital to facilitate operations."

### Municipal Education Bureau Issues a Circular to Municipal Middle Schools to Stop Collecting Respect-for-Teachers Funds; This Is in Accordance with the Resolution of the Municipal Council; Female Schools Are Also Ordered to Add Health Education Courses

The Municipal Education Bureau has issued a circular to all schools to stop collecting the respect-for-teachers fund attached to this semester's tuition in municipal primary and secondary schools, in accordance with the resolution of the Municipal Council. According to Mr. Li Ximou, deputy director of the bureau, who met with a Central News Agency reporter yesterday, the funds that have already been collected will be managed by the Respect-for-Teachers Fund Management Committee, and those that have not yet been paid will no longer be collected in accordance with the resolution of the Municipal Council. Mr. Li also stated that the Municipal Council has approved 20% of the city's financial budget for education expenses, and the Education Bureau will do its best to work for the city's education within this budget. However, this amount is still far from the actual needs, as there are no dedicated funds for building school buildings, etc. Regarding the resolution of the Municipal Council to order all girls' schools to add courses such as obstetrics, common sense, and infant and maternity hygiene, the Education Bureau has decided to ask the Health Bureau for assistance in adding health education courses to the schools starting next semester, including teaching the above-mentioned hygiene knowledge.

### After Victory and Re-establishment, National Middle Schools Are Not Directly Established by the Ministry of Education; They Are Handled by Various Provinces and Cities

[Report from this newspaper in Nanjing, 8th] During the Anti-Japanese War, middle school students from provinces and cities in the occupied areas fled. To rescue these youths who had lost their schooling, the Ministry of Education specially established many national middle schools to accommodate and educate them. After the victory, as education in the provinces and cities was restored, the Ministry of Education handed over the national middle schools to the provinces and cities to manage. Recently, the eight national middle school students remaining in the rear were separately placed in six schools in Sichuan, still under the jurisdiction of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Education. The national middle schools have come to an end. However, the Ministry of Education had a Wartime Youth Recruitment Committee during the war. After the victory, the Recruitment Committee was renamed the Youth Enrollment and Employment Counseling Committee, and Minister Zhu Jiahua of the Ministry of Education continued to serve as its chairman. The committee's administrative documents were submitted to the Executive Yuan by the Ministry of Education, and its expenses were independent. After the victory, the education of youths in the recovered areas still needed to be handled. The Counseling Committee specially formulated a plan to establish 21 middle schools in the recovered areas, provinces, and cities to accommodate them. The required funds were huge, and it was proposed to request the Executive Yuan to directly allocate them and have the provinces and cities manage the schools. The specific plan and budget have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, and it is reported that they are still under review. If approved, middle schools will be established by the provinces and cities, and the Ministry of Education will not directly run national middle schools alone.

### Downsizing in Beiping City

Wang Jigao Says It's An Inevitable Measure

[Report from our newspaper in Beiping, 6th] (Delayed Arrival) Yesterday, the joint committee of the Beiping Municipal Elementary School Teachers' Union elected six representatives, including Zhang Zuxiu, to visit Director Wang Jigao of the Municipal Education Bureau to discuss a solution to the downsizing issue. Director Wang's reply was as follows: (1) This downsizing is an inevitable measure taken in accordance with central directives and due to financial reasons. (2) Regarding the unease of teachers in various schools, it is generally believed that if funds are further insufficient, there will be further downsizing. Director Wang stated that downsizing will only happen this time, and he absolutely guarantees that there will be no further downsizing as long as he is in this position.

### Education Bureau Sets National Day Commemoration Measures for Social Education Institutions; Budgeted Expenses are 2 Million Yuan

### Waiting to Meet Again at Next Year's National Games; The Two Strong Teams from the South and North Missed Each Other; The Qunsheng and Huasheng Teams Did Not Meet; Qunsheng Must Return to the Philippines on the 14th; Huasheng Can Only Fly to Shanghai on the 15th

[Report from this newspaper] The Qunsheng basketball team must leave Shanghai to return to the Philippines on the 14th due to shipping schedules. Therefore, they will go to Beijing today, planning to stay for two days and perform at the Lizhi Society before visiting Wuxi on the way. The trip to Suzhou was canceled due to lack of time. They will rush back to Shanghai on the 13th and return to the Philippines in two groups on the 14th, with some taking the plane and some taking the boat. The plan to have a game with the Zhenglun team can only be abandoned. The Basketball Committee urged the Tianjin Huasheng team from North China to come to Shanghai to compete with Qunsheng for the national championship. Huasheng's reply arrived yesterday, stating that they would catch a flight to Shanghai on the 15th due to the Double Ten National Day Games in North China. Unfortunately, Qunsheng could not wait any longer, and the good opportunity was missed, which is deeply regrettable. They can only wait to meet again at the National Games next year. The Basketball Committee has sent a special telegram to Tianjin Huasheng about this situation.

### Ten Wins in Ten Games Are Commendable; Qunsheng Completes Glorious Record; 37 to 28 Points Defeat the Giants for the Third Time Last Night; Going to Beijing This Morning and Returning to Shanghai on the 13th and Returning to the Philippines on the 14th

[Report from this newspaper] The Qunsheng basketball team from the Philippines has gloriously completed its mission in Shanghai, winning all ten games and creating a perfect record. In their final game last night, in a farewell memorial, they defeated the Giants for the third time with 37 to 28 points. In the first half, Qunsheng took the lead with 16 to 14. Last night, the plan was to play against the Qinglian team of the Giant Encas, but due to the illness of Encas's general Blot, the game was changed to be played by the pure Giant team. The gymnasium was still full, and the atmosphere was very enthusiastic, with about 5,000 spectators. Soldiers, police, and scouts maintained order, and the Shanghai Radio Station broadcasted live from the scene. The band from the Orphanage automatically came to the scene to play and cheer. Qunsheng is scheduled to go to Beijing by car led by Lin Zhuguang at 7:00 AM this morning, return here on the 13th, and leave Shanghai to return to the Philippines on the 14th.

Written Displayed Dullness

Before the game, Qunsheng team leader Lin Zhuguang presented a ball to the Basketball Committee as a gift, which Qian Xuchang received amid applause. Because Qunsheng had played ten consecutive games, they were inevitably tired, and with many injured players, the game was not as tight and effective as in the past, and the excitement was less than in the past. The situation displayed dullness, and the score in the first half was very close. In the first quarter, the Giants once led by six to one, but the overall situation was always under the control of Qunsheng. The Giants defended very strictly, but they were very poor at shooting, repeatedly missing shots, otherwise the situation might have changed.

Qunsheng Led by One Point

Referees Qu Honglv and Liu Hesheng blew the whistle to start the game. Cai Wenhua of Qunsheng took a short rest due to injury, and Chen Jinde, Chen Jinzhi, Cai Wenzhang, Yang Renhui, and Zhang Yuyi took the field. The Giants started with Founick, Stevenson, Ketjemilov, Tauberlinji, and Yelong. After the start of the game, Ketjemilov opened the scoring with a long shot. Jinzhi scored a point from a free throw to pull back one point. Ketjemilov scored a second goal, and the Giants led with six to one. Jindezhang scored four points together, but Yelong and Stevenson of the Giants scored three points, making it nine to five. Qunsheng called a timeout, and Zhang Yuyi made a free throw, and Jinde stole the ball, chasing to eight to nine. Before long, the first quarter ended. In the next round, Stevenson of Qunsheng fouled, and Yang Renhui scored one point, creating a tie. Wenzhang made a wonderful shot, and Qunsheng took the lead again with eleven to nine. They then tied at twelve points twice. Yang Renhui hit a long-range shot, and Qunsheng raised their heads again. Tauberlinji broke through the middle, creating a third tie. Jinzhi broke into the basket and scored a goal. When Cai Wenhua adjusted Chen Jinde out, the first half ended appropriately, with Qunsheng leading by one point at sixteen to fourteen.

Giants Fell Behind from Then On

After the break, Qunsheng replaced Chen Jinzhi with Cai Lianke, and the Giants brought in Qiang Dulai and Sashijin to replace Yelong and Stevenson. After the Giants made a free throw by Founick, they could not raise their heads from then on. Wenzhang, Lianke, and Wenhua of Qunsheng made repeated contributions, and in the blink of an eye, they led remotely with 21 to 15 and 24 to 16. At 26 to 20, Qunsheng Chen Jinzhi replaced Cai Wenzhang, and Zhang Yuyi made a long-range shot, breaking the net. Cai Lianke scored three points with consecutive free throws and shots. The Giants were at a loss. At the end of the third quarter, the visitors led by eleven points at 31 to 20. In the last quarter, the Giants replaced Sashijin and Ketjemilov with Stevenson and Yelong. Chen Jinzhi scored first, Stevenson scored a free throw, and Yang Renhui put the ball into the basket, making the score 35 to 21. The Giants replaced Tauberlinji with Sashijin. At this time, Zhang Yuyi was disqualified for five fouls, and Chen Jinde entered the field. The Giants saw a slight turnaround, and the score was slightly closer. By the time Sashijin scored, the bell had already rung, and Qunsheng defeated the Giants with 38 to 29.

Brief Reports from the Civil Administration

### Ministry of Interior Issues Handling Measures for Former Non-German/Japanese Nationals Who Have Reverted to Their Original Nationalities

The Ministry of Interior has approved a telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the question of "whether former non-German/Japanese nationals who subsequently acquired German/Japanese nationality due to marriage or other reasons, but after the Allied victory, have reverted to their original nationality and possess a certificate from their original country's embassy or consulate in China, are exempt from the various measures for dealing with enemy aliens." The matter has been reviewed and resolved as follows:

1.  If a former non-German/Japanese national in China acquired German/Japanese nationality due to marriage or other reasons, and subsequently, after the promulgation of various laws and regulations by our government regarding the handling of German/Japanese nationals, reverts to their original nationality because the marital relationship has indeed ended or for other reasons, then the aforementioned laws and regulations shall still apply to those nationals.

2.  If a former non-German/Japanese national in China acquired German/Japanese nationality due to marriage or other reasons, but retains their original nationality according to the nationality laws of their home country, our government will still recognize that such nationals possess their original nationality. If these nationals engaged in acts endangering China in occupied areas or other regions, they shall still be dealt with in accordance with our laws.

The above two points have been approved by the Ministry of Interior with the consent of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Municipal Government has been instructed to take note.

### The Light Trotting of Hooves on Bluestone Slabs: The Weary Journey on the Xuzhou-Huaiyin Road

— Report from Huaiyin, 2nd, Our Special Correspondent, Hang Zhou

The recovery of Huaiyin, the "Yan'an of Northern Jiangsu," is a significant event. Militarily, the situation in Northern Jiangsu is expected to clear up soon. Politically, it nakedly exposes the true nature of the Communist Party's "liberated areas."

On September 28th, the reporter traveled from Xuzhou to Huaiyin. The Xuzhou-Huaiyin highway can arguably be described as the worst road. As the Communist army retreated section by section, they destroyed the road section by section. They are indeed experts in destroying roads, and the road was destroyed so thoroughly. The National Army mobilized a large number of laborers to repair it, but even now, the road is still like waves in the sea. A six-wheeled army truck, weighing five tons itself and reaching a total weight of nine tons, moved forward like a drunkard, swaying and staggering. Everyone inside the truck was dizzy from the bumping.

Like Emerging from a Coal Mine

The north is the world of wind and sand. More than a dozen large trucks drove in succession, and those behind seemed to be driving in a cloud of dust. We arrived in Suqian late in the evening, and after getting out of the car, everyone looked as if they had emerged from a coal mine.

There was no place to stay in Suqian. Most of the houses had been destroyed, and the few that remained were occupied by soldiers. I had no choice but to stay at the county government. County Magistrate Dong Jianhua received me with a half-sick body. He told me that since returning to his hometown, both the secretary-general of the county party committee and the secretary of the county youth league had fallen ill, and he hoped that he could keep going.

Early the next morning, I took a car to Siyang again. The closer we got to the front, the harder the road became. In Yanghe Town, famous for its "Yanghe Da Mian" (wheat noodles), there was a bridge that could not bear heavy loads. The supplies had to be unloaded, the empty truck driven across, and then reloaded. This up-and-down process took two hours. This was not economical, and there was always the possibility of being attacked by the Communist army. The troops at the front found the inflexibility of transportation the most troublesome thing.

Arsonist Xue Weixian

We stopped in Siyang for another night. The large trucks could only go this far. Further ahead, the old Yellow River Bridge and the Grand Canal Bridge were obstacles. The Communist army set fire to these two bridges when they left. The arsonist was Xue Weixian, the chairman of a civilian association. I saw him in the Siyang County government prison. He admitted that he did it, but as usual, he claimed that he was forced to. The damage to the two bridges is simply impossible to quantify. Currently, engineers and laborers are concentrated on repairing them, and they should be officially open to traffic on October 3rd. If it were not for the destruction of the bridges, which prevented supplies from reaching the front, the National Army would not have temporarily halted its advance after reaching Huaiyin and Huai'an, giving the Communist army a chance to catch their breath.

The extent of the damage in Siyang is the most severe of the counties recently recovered by the National Army. The city is almost gone. The new city, Zhongxing Town, is on the opposite bank of the river and is also in ruins. There are very few residents. According to statistics, there are only 8,200 people in the urban area. All commerce has ceased. There are only a few vendors selling cigarettes and pancakes. I came from the prosperous areas of Jiangnan, and it was like going back a century. I was truly overwhelmed with emotion.

Riding Straight to Matou Town

With the main road impassable, the only way to go to Huaiyin was by a small road. It was originally a oxcart path, but the surface had been widened due to military transportation. Jeeps could pass from Siyang to Nanxinjie. He Zhenming, the branch supervisor of the 12th Logistic Station of the Joint Service Headquarters, happened to be going to inspect the area, so I hopped in his jeep and went.

It was only 35 li, and we arrived in an hour and a half. The headquarters of the 28th Reorganized Division was stationed here. The adjutant's office sent a horse to take me to Huaiyin. It was another 60 li from here.

After lunch, I set off at 2:00 PM. The horse was a Japanese horse, quite tall, but it walked very slowly. The groom wanted me to whip it hard, but I was a little worried, fearing that it would get excited and run so fast that I couldn't hold the reins. So, we proceeded at a speed of 10 li per hour. Near Matou Town, we needed to cross two rivers. The ferry was small, and the water was deep, so we couldn't cross. I asked the horse to return. I walked to Matou Town. Looking at my watch, it was already 6:00 PM. It was still 20 li to Huaiyin, and my legs were sore from using too much energy, so I couldn't walk fast. But I was determined to get to Huaiyin. I inquired in Matou Town and learned that the 192nd Brigade of the 28th Division was stationed here. I visited Brigade Commander Zeng Zhen. In addition to sending a horse to take me, he also sent four soldiers with guns.

Weary Journey of Three Full Days

Before long, it got dark. The night was when the Communist army was active, and the suburbs of Huaiyin were not very peaceful. But I came to visit it. The sound of hooves echoed on the bluestone slabs. I arrived at the north gate of Huaiyin. My excitement banished my fear.

Huaiyin City was under martial law. After 8:00 PM, traffic was prohibited. It was already 8:30 PM. After some negotiation, I was finally allowed into the city. The martial law was indeed extremely strict. When I first arrived in Huaiyin, I saw how thoroughly the officers and soldiers of the 74th Reorganized Division, which had recovered Huaiyin, carried out their orders. From the north gate to the adjutant's office of the division headquarters, I went through more than a dozen checkpoints, which took two hours.

It took me three days to get from Xuzhou to Huaiyin, which I was told was the fastest possible. County Magistrate Huang Jiaju walked to his post, which took him even longer. Huaiyin was once a place shrouded in mystery, and now, I will uncover this secret for you.

### On the Strength and Improvement of Overseas Chinese Commerce (Part 2)

— Qiu Bincun

(4) The Strength of Overseas Chinese Commerce in Burma

Overseas Chinese in Burma are geographically divided into two parts: Upper Burma and Lower Burma. The former, due to its proximity to Yunnan, has land routes. They engage in civil engineering and the gemstone industry. Therefore, most immigrants are from Yunnan. The latter comes via sea routes, so most immigrants are from Fujian and Guangdong, residing along the Irrawaddy River and the coast, with Rangoon as the center. People from Yunnan account for about 32%, Fujian 28%, Guangdong 21%, and other unspecified overseas Chinese 19%. There are more than 350,000 overseas Chinese in Burma with citizenship that can be relinquished, and about one million mixed-race Burmese without citizenship, totaling more than 1.3 million, accounting for more than one-tenth of the total population of Burma. The international trade of Burma and the commercial situation of overseas Chinese are analyzed as follows:

1.  Burma's Trade with the International Community and China

Now, let’s explore the trade situation between Burma and the international community, and China. Regarding its relations with the international community, we can express it with the following numbers:

(1) Burma's Trade with the International Community

Table of Burma's Foreign Trade and Percentage Distribution from 1939 to 1940 (Unit: Thousand Rupees)

Looking at the previous table, it can be seen that in Burma's trade with the international community, India ranks first, the United Kingdom and its colonies rank second, Japan ranks third, the United States and Africa rank fourth, and Europe and other countries rank fifth.

(2) Burma's Trade with China

As for Burma's foreign trade with China, it was first recorded in our customs registers in 1868, with a value of 23.4 million customs taels that year. This record was not broken until 1900. From 1901 to 1930, there was gradual progress, reaching 199.912 million yuan. From 1933 to 1934, due to the global economic depression, trade declined. Sino-Burmese trade was incorporated into Indian statistics in 1934, and only later became independent.

The following is a table of Burma's trade statistics with China from 1936 to 1940:

Statistics of Burma's Exports to China and Percentage of China's Total Foreign Trade Value (Unit: Thousand National Currency)

According to the table on the right, it should be known that Burma's trade with China has always had exports exceeding imports. Although there has been a tendency for import surplus since 1940, much of it is due to goods imported from China and transshipped to other countries via Burma. Moreover, in the 78 years, Burma's trade position with China has always been less than 1% of China's total import and export volume. However, this refers to maritime trade. Land trade has not been included in the customs register, making it difficult to accurately estimate. During the war, China's seaports were blockaded. Following the international sister road of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, the Burma Road became important. According to investigations, from 1939 to 1940, the value of goods transported from Burma to China via land was 19.5 million rupees.

In summary, we can get a correct understanding: that many raw materials needed by countries such as Britain, the United States, China, and the Netherlands must be supplied by Burma; conversely, many of the manufactured goods produced also need to find considerable outlets in Burma. Moreover, Japan ranked second in Burma's trade. After the invasion and occupation, it built the Burma-Thailand Railway and forcibly implemented cotton planting plans in Burma, producing 17,900 tons annually from 1942 to 1943, and 16,000 square yards of cotton cloth. Therefore, the earliest recovery of Burma in the Pacific War: (1) From the perspective of our Allied countries, China, Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands, the recovery of Burma enables each other's economies to complement each other's strengths. (2) Furthermore, from the perspective of inflicting a major blow on Japan through economic warfare, the recovery of Burma eliminates its long-term exploitation of Burma's resources for its own survival, thereby leading to its early collapse and surrender. Burma's relationship with international economy, whether in peacetime or wartime, is of such importance.

2.  Commerce of Overseas Chinese

As for the employment situation of Burmese and overseas Chinese, the former's agricultural population accounts for less than one-third of the total population. More are engaged in primary industries, with a total of 12,422,074 people employed. The latter mainly engages in commerce and industry, with commerce being twice as prevalent as industry. The most common businesses operated are general merchandise stores. The next most common are rice and grain and local produce businesses. These are explained separately below:

(1) Rice Industry: The power is in the hands of Europeans, but inland transportation is mostly operated by overseas Chinese, especially those from Fujian. There are about 100 rice mills owned by overseas Chinese in Burma, and hundreds of grain trading firms. Overseas Chinese engaged in the rice business mostly obtain profits through lending and acting as intermediaries.

(2) Local Produce Industry: Commonly known as coarse goods merchants, overseas Chinese, in addition to focusing on soybean exports, also include selling betel nuts, tobacco, bananas, cowhide, black tea, etc. imported from India. Most of those engaged in this business are from Fujian, followed by Yunnan, and then Guangdong. The footprints of these merchants can be found in large and small cities. Among them, betel nut is a daily necessity for local people and has a very wide market. However, due to insufficient capital or lack of understanding of market conditions, overseas Chinese merchants cannot directly handle the goods, so the market is often seized by Indian merchants. Cowhide is transshipped to Europe and America, with substantial profits.

(3) General Merchandise Merchants: They deal in selling daily necessities. Indian merchants are the most powerful in this category, followed by overseas Chinese. However, the universality of Chinese merchants far exceeds that of Indian merchants. The items sold include daily necessities such as oil, salt, sugar, garlic, chili, beans, and seafood, as well as domestic goods such as tea, firecrackers, lychees, candles, and tooth powder.

(4) Foreign Goods Stores: They sell piece goods, decorations, appliances, and Chinese and Western stationery.

(5) Timber Merchants: These merchants mostly purchase large quantities of forests from local people or contract for logging, and then resell them to factories.

(6) Pharmacies: They specialize in selling Chinese and Western medicines, medical supplies, etc. Most of these commodities in Burma are operated by overseas Chinese and Indians. Locals who operate this business are as rare as phoenix feathers. However, compared with Indians, overseas Chinese account for a larger proportion.

(7) Ironware Merchants: There are about 100 households in total. Because European goods are expensive, they are quite popular.

(8) Remittance Business: Generally known as "Piye" in South India. They specialize in handling remittances for overseas Chinese. Although post offices and banks have been actively involved recently, these merchants can obtain replies for remitters, so overseas Chinese trust them quite a bit.

(9) There are also other non-purely commercial businesses: such as (1) Convenience Stores - with sweet flavors and snacks, such as coffee, cocoa, sweet tea, pastries, etc., and salty flavors and snacks, such as noodles, rice, and dishes; (2) Workshops - with photography, dentistry, sewing, barbering, shoemaking, and repair of machinery; (3) Specialty Stores - managing local government monopolies on tobacco, alcohol, opium, kerosene, and contracting pawnshops. Slaughter tax and other taxes. Among these three types of businesses, except for (1) and a part of (2), which are operated by Chinese, Indian, and Burmese people, the rest are almost exclusively occupied by overseas Chinese.

Among the above nine categories, in terms of the proportion operated by overseas Chinese themselves, the former category (1) accounts for 11%, (2) accounts for 20%, (3) accounts for 17%, (4) accounts for 16%, (5) accounts for about 6%, (6) accounts for 5%, (7) accounts for 4%, (8) accounts for 3%, and (9) accounts for 15%.

(5) The Strength of Overseas Chinese Commerce in Malaya

There are 2.4 million overseas Chinese in Malaya, with those from Fujian ranking first, accounting for about 53%, followed by Guangdong, accounting for about 41%, and other overseas Chinese from various provinces accounting for about 6%. Singapore in Malaya, geographically located at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, has become the largest port in Southeast Asia and is used by various countries as a distribution center for goods. Singapore is not only the economic center of overseas Chinese but also the place where overseas Chinese in Southeast Asian countries promote culture and education, and even launch activities such as saving the country and disaster relief. The leaders of overseas Chinese in Singapore always lead. Singapore also ranks third among the seven major commercial ports in Asia. The importance of overseas Chinese commerce in Malaya is self-evident. According to the 1931 population census report of Malaya, there were 940,972 employed overseas Chinese, accounting for 55% of the total population, of which 146,882 were engaged in commerce and finance, accounting for 85% of the total overseas Chinese population in Malaya, or 15.6% of the employed population. According to a survey by the Singapore Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in 1938, there were 110 types of commercial activities engaged by overseas Chinese in the Singapore area, with 6,750 shops. The following analysis focuses on the two aspects of the types of stores operated by overseas Chinese in Singapore and their position among rubber merchants, reflecting a glimpse of the commercial activities of overseas Chinese in Singapore and Malaya.

1.  Categories of Overseas Chinese Shops in Singapore

Among the 6,765 shops owned by overseas Chinese in Singapore, the following five categories are the most numerous among the 110 types of businesses:

Among the five categories, general merchandise merchants rank first, followed by coffee merchants, and then agents. This is sufficient to prove that there are many shops owned by overseas Chinese, but they are mostly intermediaries. In terms of businesses, rubber, number nine-eight guild, rice, automobiles, porcelain, and cordage are mostly operated by people from Fujian. General merchandise is mostly handled by people from Guangzhou and Jiaying, fabrics are mostly handled by people from Chaozhou, coffee is mostly handled by \[unclear], pawnshops are mostly handled by Hakka from Dabu, leather shoes are mostly handled by people from Jiaying, Western medicine is half from Fujian, and Chinese medicine is mostly handled by Hakka from Guangzhou.

2.  The Position of Overseas Chinese and Foreign Rubber Merchants in Singapore

There are 228 rubber merchants in Singapore, and 177 of them are owned by overseas Chinese, which is more than any single country such as Britain, Japan, the United States, or the Netherlands. The comparison is listed below:

Although the number of rubber shops owned by overseas Chinese is more than the total number of shops owned by Britain, Japan, the United States, and the Netherlands combined, like other shops, overseas Chinese rubber merchants are also mostly intermediaries, and their capital scale is difficult to match that of foreign merchants.

6.  The Strength of Overseas Chinese Commerce in the Dutch East Indies

There are 1.4 million overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies, most of whom are engaged in commerce. They occupy an intermediate position in commerce, purchasing goods from "Tokos" (warehouses) of large Western and Eastern ocean liners and reselling them to local people. At the same time, they purchase local products from local people and resell them to European, American, and Japanese exporting "Tokos," making a profit of one percent. Few directly operate importing and exporting "Tokos." Most are small and medium-sized merchants, especially retailers. Not only are there overseas Chinese retail merchants in large cities, but even in remote areas, as long as there are people living, there are their traces. The pervasiveness of their strength is unparalleled. Therefore, the investments and income of overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies are divided into two points as follows:

1.  Investments of Overseas Chinese

(1) Comparison of Investments by Overseas Chinese and Foreigners

According to a survey by Helfferich in 1921, among the investments in the Dutch East Indies, the Netherlands accounted for 73%, ranking first, overseas Chinese accounted for 10%, ranking second, Britain accounted for 9%, ranking third, and Japan accounted for 1%. Although this may seem outdated from today's perspective, it can still reflect the situation at that time and the foundation of overseas Chinese investment.

(2) Commercial Investments of Overseas Chinese

The previous survey by Helfferich on overseas Chinese investment may have been incomplete due to the lack of inspections on that day, or because overseas Chinese investment has increased with the evolution of the times. Therefore, his statistics can only serve as a preliminary basis for overseas Chinese investment in the Dutch East Indies and cannot be regarded as a definitive conclusion. Recent surveys of overseas Chinese investments in various commercial sectors show that, in terms of invested capital, there are 1,500 overseas Chinese local product merchants with capital of more than 100,000 guilders, 600 fabric merchants with capital of more than 50,000 guilders, 1,250 general merchandise merchants with capital of more than 50,000 guilders, 50 other ordinary merchants with capital of more than 10,000 guilders, and 8 merchants with capital of more than 1,000 guilders. Statistics show that the commercial wealth of overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies is around 792.5 million guilders. As for the regional origins of overseas Chinese active in various commercial sectors in the Dutch East Indies, generally speaking, those from Fujian mostly deal in local products, and those from Guangdong mostly deal in general merchandise. Further analysis shows that people from Zhangzhou and Quanzhou mostly deal in local products, fish, rice, and fabrics, rubber factories, and oil mills. Hakka mostly deal in general merchandise, wine and cheese, shoe stores, jewelry, and sewing. People from Changting mostly deal in medicinal materials. People from Guangdong mostly deal in hotels, restaurants, photography, civil engineering, and machinery factories. People from Chaozhou mostly engage in agriculture and vegetable gardens.

2.  Assets and Income of Overseas Chinese

According to the report of the Dutch East Indies Central Bureau of Statistics: In 1937, there were a total of 3,079 overseas Chinese with assets ranging from 25,000 guilders to 1 million guilders, with a total asset value of 242 million guilders. In 1938, it decreased to 2,684 people, and the total assets also decreased to 220 million guilders. The average monthly income of ordinary overseas Chinese ranges from 40 guilders to 150 guilders. Furthermore, according to the 1938 report of the Dutch East Indies Central Bureau of Statistics, the annual income and number of overseas Chinese are as follows: Unit: (Guilders)

Annual Income Number of People

900——1,000 3,631

1,000——1,200 5,811

1,200——1,500 8,262

1,500——2,000 8,627

2,000——2,500 5,095

2,500——3,000 3,008

3,000——4,000 3,738

4,000——5,000 1,900

5,000——6,000 1,097

6,000——8,000 1,209

8,000——10,000 544

10,000——12,000 318

12,000——15,000 270

15,000——20,000 196

20,000——25,000 85

25,000——30,000 85

30,000——40,000 55

40,000——50,000 18

50,000——60,000 12

60,000——80,000 15

80,000——100,000 3

100,000——120,000 2

120,000 and Above 1

Total 3,955,000,000

The previous table only lists the annual income of overseas Chinese above the middle class; the income of those below the middle class is not included. It is estimated that the total income of overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies is at least 5 billion guilders.

More than half of the overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies are engaged in commerce. Jan Pieterszoon Coen, the first Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, said: "The overseas Chinese are the most hardworking and an indispensable ethnic group in our cities." W.J. Katon, commenting on the economic status of overseas Chinese, said: "Due to the diligence, frugality, and business acumen of overseas Chinese, they are not only beneficial to the future Dutch East Indies society but also an indispensable element." In peacetime, the overseas Chinese have made contributions to the construction of cities and the development of mountains and fields in the Dutch East Indies. During World War II, the overseas Chinese assisted the Dutch Allied forces and local people in jointly resisting the Japanese army. After the Allied victory and the defeat of Japan, the Sino-Dutch Equal Treaty was signed in London on May 29 last year, and the ratified copies were formally exchanged in Chongqing on December 5 of the same year. It is hoped that the Dutch East Indies government and local people will understand that the overseas Chinese are hardworking, frugal, easy to get along with, and worthy of being treated differently. Do not oppress the overseas Chinese at every turn, and give each other "the right for the people of the other contracting party to enter and exit its territory, as well as to travel, reside, and engage in commerce throughout the territory," so that overseas Chinese can live and work in peace, and the economic relations between the two countries will be even closer and more advanced.

3.  Principles for Improving Overseas Chinese Commerce

From the above, it should be possible to get a glimpse of the strengths of overseas Chinese, which are their diligence and frugality, making their commercial power solid and invincible. On the downside, it is obvious that overseas Chinese commerce only occupies an intermediate position, lacking the tight organization and scientific management of modern large enterprises. They rely on individual self-reliance, hard work, and perseverance, but lack the spirit of pooling ideas, collective efforts, and cooperation. Matters such as national protection and financial accommodation are considered inadequate. Therefore, although there are many overseas Chinese and their business talents are outstanding, they can only be intermediate merchants and cannot become large merchants with uniqueness and control over the commercial arena. When engaging in commerce, one should engage in large-scale businesses and enterprises, not small businesses. Merchants should be large merchants who occupy important positions in the commercial arena, not small merchants who haggle over every penny. In the future, to promote the strengths of overseas Chinese, address the shortcomings of overseas Chinese, and improve overseas Chinese commerce, the following three principles should be followed:

1.  National Aspect

(1) There should be dedicated institutions and capable personnel to guide overseas Chinese investment.

(2) Protect national capital and adopt conservation policies.

(3) Improve the equal legal status of overseas Chinese in their places of residence and promote the participation of overseas Chinese in local political activities.

(4) Enhance China's international status, improve China's foreign economic relations, and strive for equal opportunities for overseas Chinese in the economic development of Southeast Asia.

(5) The state should provide loans to assist those returning overseas, especially those returning to Southeast Asia, to develop economic enterprises abroad.

2.  Overseas Chinese Aspect

(1) Promote joint ventures and cooperation among overseas Chinese businesses: (1) In terms of nature - reduce retailers and switch to production enterprises. (2) Concentration principle - concentrate scattered capital into capital for production enterprises. (3) Utilization method - use idle capital to concentrate on production. (4) Cooperation method - promote talent and technical cooperation.

(2) Improve business methods: (1) Change from sole proprietorship or small partnership to modern enterprise organization. (2) Establish overseas Chinese financial circulation institutions. (3) Directly handle international trade and improve the status of overseas Chinese intermediaries. (4) Recognize the weaknesses of foreign economic enterprises, strive to develop our strengths, and get along well with local people with a good attitude of national diplomacy to enhance mutual feelings.

3.  Coordination and Connection

(1) Overseas Chinese invest in shipping to assist the government in developing foreign transportation enterprises.

(2) Utilize the rich resources of China and foreign countries to make up for the lack of domestic resources.

(3) Promote the sale of Chinese-made finished products and materials abroad.

(4) After China's industrialization, transfer the surplus population to Southeast Asia to develop overseas Chinese economic enterprises.

(5) Under the condition that foreign economic enterprises do not harm their development, invest their surplus capital domestically to develop production and construction enterprises in the motherland.

(6) Seek cooperation and coordination of domestic and foreign talents and technologies.

(7) Develop cooperative business operations between the government and merchants through mutual assistance and cooperation in capital.

(8) The state and overseas Chinese should assist each other in developing international trade.

In short, in order to promote the economy and commerce of overseas Chinese in the future, one must consider the following points:

(1) The development of Southeast Asian economic enterprises after the war should abandon the laissez-faire doctrine of the past and closely cooperate with domestic economic construction.

(2) The individualistic free competition method in overseas Chinese economic enterprises should be greatly improved in order to achieve the purpose of protecting overseas Chinese businesses.

(3) The government should strive for equal treatment for overseas Chinese through diplomatic channels.

(4) The government should provide technical talents and give overseas Chinese appropriate guidance.

(5) Overseas Chinese economic enterprises, which have been destroyed and plundered by the enemy during the war, should be assisted by the government with practical and swift methods through loans to help them recover, revive, and develop after the war, depending on the actual needs. (End)

### Economic Merger of the British and American Zones in Germany to Counter Soviet Expansion; British and American Expenditures Exceed 400 Million Yuan Annually

— Translated by our editorial department from U.S. News & World Report — Xi

The British and American occupation zones in Germany are now preparing for an economic merger. The current cost to the British and American governments for Germany is approximately two billion yuan annually. After the two zones merge, the burden on British and American taxpayers can be reduced by thirty percent. However, even after the merger, Germany will not be self-sufficient for several years.

The real purpose of the merger is actually political, nothing more than to let the Soviet Union know that abolishing all boundaries and economically integrating Germany is beneficial to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union can isolate itself from the Western occupation zones and await an opportunity, hoping that the burden Germany places on the British and Americans will cause them to become impatient or even withdraw from Germany, in which case all of Germany will fall into the hands of the Communists and the Soviet Union.

The Soviet Union has no difficulty waiting for an opportunity. Among the four occupation zones, only the Soviet zone has a surplus of food, exceeding 2,654,000 tons in 1939. What the Soviet Union fears is that, regardless of the cost, the British and Americans will proceed with their planned development of Germany into a non-communist country with an economic power greater than the Soviet occupation zone.

American occupation zone official Clay expressed his opinion on the merger of the British and American occupation zones, saying, "The main reason for the merger is necessity. The American occupation zone is not economically self-sufficient, but it contributes greatly to other occupation zones. After the merger of the British and American zones, Germans can have the opportunity to earn a living for the first time since the end of the war."

Since Germany was divided into four parts, it has completely lost its economic function. This economic paralysis has increased the heavy burden on British and American taxpayers. The purpose of the merger is to alleviate this unhealthy state.

The annual cost to Britain and the United States for providing supplies and managing their respective occupation zones is 200 million yuan for the United States and 220 million yuan for Britain, in addition to occupation expenses. Until suspicion among the great powers is eliminated, and until Germany can achieve economic self-sufficiency under the supervision of the powers, British and American troops cannot be reduced to the minimum number as planned.

According to British estimates, the total annual salary of the 350,000 British troops stationed in Germany is 430 million yuan, excluding food and other maintenance costs. British soldiers' salaries are far less generous than those of American soldiers. The average annual salary of a British soldier is about 2,700 yuan, while that of an American soldier is about 6,000 yuan. The annual cost of maintaining 315,000 people in the American occupation zone has not been accurately estimated, but even if the total cost per person is reduced to 3,000 yuan, the total would be around one billion yuan.

In addition to these staggering figures (more than two billion yuan combined for Britain and the United States), there are countless losses suffered by Britain and the United States due to the economic disorder in other parts of Europe caused by the unresolved German problem. If a divided Germany did not burden Europe, then the billions of dollars spent on relief work and loans could be greatly saved.

It is expected that within six months after the implementation of the merger of the British and American zones, the dependence on external sources of materials can be gradually reduced. Several benefits are already available. Britain can supply ample bituminous coal and coke, gravel, phosphate fertilizers, pig iron, semi-finished iron, finished steel, construction steel, and railway materials.

The American occupation zone is politically more advanced than the British occupation zone. Germans under American supervision hold real power, while Germans in the British zone are only advisors. To align with this situation, Britain will grant German officials greater power.

The joint development of economic resources in the two occupation zones can enhance strength to resist inflation. If the Soviet Union firmly opposes restoring Germany's productivity, then this new strength must be used.

The financial plan drafted by three American experts is being promoted by Clay. The plan advocates that the unavoidable war expenses and the price of defeat be shared equally by the German people. The new currency, capital tax, and property tax in the plan will apply to all of Germany. If the Soviet Union rejects this plan, Britain and the United States will establish a financial system independently in the merged area.

After the merger of the two zones, a standard rationing system will be implemented. Initially, it is planned to reduce the ration of the ten million Germans in the American occupation zone to be equal to the ration of the Germans in the British zone. However, with a good harvest expected, the ration in the British zone may be increased to be equal to the ration in the American zone.

The harvest of sweet potatoes in the British zone this year may reach nine million tons, almost double the more than five million tons last year. The harvest in the American zone has also increased. If the food ration for miners in the Ruhr area can be increased, then assuming there are 360,000 miners, daily production can reach 300,000 tons.

The merger of the British and American occupation zones indicates that the Soviet Union and France must choose between "competition" and "partnership." In fact, economic merger and agricultural improvement can reduce the annual burden on British and American taxpayers by thirty percent. This is a considerable saving. However, experts admit that the merger of the British and American occupation zones is only an expedient measure. Its purpose is to encourage France and the Soviet Union to cooperate and work towards the economic unification of all of Germany, so that all the powers can benefit.

### The World Situation: Relaxed Externally, Tense Internally

— Chu Yukun

Verbal Peace, But Vigilance Unrelaxed

Since Stalin's call for peace, the world, filled with talk of war, has suddenly had a chance to clear up. Although the American press was very indifferent to Stalin's speech, Eisenhower, who had just arrived in Berlin, was the first to express his belief that the Soviet Union could cooperate with Britain and the United States. Former Secretary of State Hull, old and respected, also called for peace among the powers from his deathbed. At the same time, US Secretary of State Byrnes spoke in Paris in response to Stalin's speech, also expressing disbelief that "a new war" was about to break out, and changing the 25-year treaty to a 40-year treaty for the disarmament of Germany. President Truman also expressed his support for Byrnes' policy in Washington, believing that the international situation could be eased as a result; however, the result of the Paris Peace Conference not only did not eliminate the contradictions between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, but instead made the rift deeper than before. Therefore, the world's attention has once again focused on the rumors of a meeting of the Big Three.

Therefore, the world situation this week is relaxed externally and tense internally. Whether the pleasing peace calls will have a real effect on the creation of world peace depends on the actual actions of all countries.

British and American Vigilance Increasing

The continued presence of the US Navy in the Mediterranean has caused unease among various countries; everyone is eagerly awaiting the decision of the US authorities. Navy Secretary Forrestal issued a statement stating that the US Navy's continued presence in the Mediterranean has two main purposes: (1) to supply the military needs of the Allied occupation forces in the European occupation zones and to assist the Allied military governments in fulfilling their occupation tasks; (2) to protect American interests and support American policies. At the same time, President Truman also explained to reporters the US policy on existing bases in the Pacific: (1) to maintain Guam and Saipan as the center of American defense in the Western Pacific; (2) to establish secondary bases in Okinawa, Truk, and other islands; (3) to also establish bases in the Philippines; (4) a solid base is currently being established on Kodiak Island near Alaska for the use of the US Navy. Subsequently, US Secretary of the Army Patterson stated more directly that the United States should maintain a strong military, with a standing army of 70 army divisions and 27 air force groups, whose tasks are two: (1) to occupy the territories of enemy countries in Europe and the Pacific to ensure the victory of the Allies; (2) in the event of any attempt to attack the United States, the standing army should immediately retaliate.

In addition, US aviator Colonel Irvine flew the Superfortress "Dream Boat" directly from Honolulu to Cairo, and the test was successful, which will have an extraordinary and significant contribution to American defense.

British Cabinet Reshuffle: Unified Military

Rumors of a British cabinet reshuffle have been circulating for a long time, and it was finally announced on the 4th. The most noteworthy feature of this reshuffle is twofold. First, the British cabinet added a Ministry of Defense to unify the British military structure, with Secretary of the Navy Alexander appointed as minister, which is a major innovation for British national defense. This move by Britain has been rumored for a long time. Army Chief of Staff Field Marshal Montgomery visited Washington earlier this month to inspect the US military organization, and stated that Britain would also reorganize its military organization according to the US system to facilitate future military cooperation between Britain and the United States. Therefore, the British cabinet's addition of a Ministry of Defense is actually a preparatory work to deal with "future wars." Second, the British cabinet reshuffle this time employed several young and promising rising stars, and the promotion of Undersecretary McNeil to Secretary of State was particularly welcomed by all parties. Today's Labor cabinet is the most vibrant cabinet in the world. However, most of the veteran members of the Labor Party remain in the cabinet, so there will not be any changes in the general policy direction, and the focus remains on state-owned policies to improve the national economic life. However, the Conservative Party Congress is being held in Blackpool, England, and Churchill believes that the opportunity is rare, so he gave a speech, fiercely criticizing the Labor government, saying that the Labor Party is willing to undermine national unity for the political interests of its party and has failed to maintain the position that Britain should occupy in the international arena. This kind of argument can often resonate with a part of the British people, but the Labor Party is in a tight spot, and the road is getting narrower and narrower. It really needs to find a way out of the depression.

### Strengthening Western Hemisphere Defense to Cope with New Aggression in the Future; US-Argentine Relations Have Improved

— Report from "World Weekly" Argentina Correspondent — Nan

The political discord between Argentina and the United States has lasted for almost five years, but recently the relationship between the two countries has clearly been undergoing a transformation. As a result of repeated meetings between Argentine President Perón and US Ambassador to Argentina Messersmith, almost all major differences have been resolved, and the stage of issuing public statements has been reached.

Once the agreement between the two countries is announced, they can proceed to discuss the plans for the Inter-American Defense and US training and partial equipment of the Argentine Armed Forces.

"World Weekly" Buenos Aires correspondent Raymond reported that diplomatic circles in the Argentine capital all believe that concerns about communism are an important factor in promoting harmony between the two countries.

Everyone remembers that in June of this year, Perón gave special preferential treatment to the Soviet Union's commercial delegation. At that time, Soviet newspapers publicized the improvement of Soviet-Argentine relations, but now he is paying special attention to Messersmith. The diplomatic community finds this change to be quite meaningful.

Three Difficulties Approaching Resolution

In fact, several difficult issues between the United States and Argentina are approaching resolution: (1) The control of industrial and commercial enterprises previously owned by Germans is being intensified. (2) The closure of German schools will soon be announced. (3) The work of deporting many Germans has been completed, including the crew of the German pocket battleship "Admiral Graf Spee."

However, there are still two points that make the United States feel dissatisfied: (1) Argentina has been slow to ratify the Inter-American agreements of Chapultepec and Mexico City. Although Perón said after being elected president that the Argentine Congress must pass them, no action has been taken to date, which baffles US officials. (2) The existence of German potential power is also a concern for the United States. One of the most puzzling points for the United States is that German tycoon Fluhr, whom the US considers to be a Nazi but Perón considers to be a close friend, claims to have obtained Argentine citizenship. The United States advocates that the nationality of people like Fluhr should be revoked and they should be expelled from the country. But no decision has been made to date.

However, the United States and Argentina will not fail to reach an agreement because of this, because other countries in the Americas hope to restore past friendly relations.

Convening a Military Conference After the Agreement is Concluded

The first part of the agreement will be largely military in nature. It is expected that Argentina will ask the United States to send a military delegation, just like the US military delegations sent to other Latin American countries to engage in military training. Therefore, US military regulations and training methods can replace the German military regulations and training methods currently used in the country. There are already US naval advisors and air force delegations in Argentina.

In addition, the United States can supply a limited number of weapons and equipment to replace the outdated equipment obtained from Europe. Officers of the Argentine army, navy, and air force can go to US military academies to study, just like officers from other Latin American countries.

After the agreement is concluded, it can also enable the Inter-American Conference to be convened earlier in the capital of Brazil to jointly discuss the defense of the Western Hemisphere to prevent aggression. The Brazilian government hopes that this meeting, which has been repeatedly postponed due to the discord between the United States and Argentina, can be convened in November.

Argentina used to be a traitor to the Inter-American Conference. The diplomatic community expects that this meeting in the capital of Brazil can test how far Argentina can cooperate with other countries in the Americas.

### The Art of Making a Living in France: My Fellow Chinese Suffer through the Years

— Our Special Correspondent Song Yu

[Our newspaper's Paris, September 26th dispatch] Chinese people who have been to Paris have probably also been to a small Zhejiang noodle shop near the Lyon station to eat wontons or fried noodles. This noodle shop is very small, the decoration is not outstanding, and there is no sign in front of the door, so it is difficult for strangers to find. It is expected that business will be slow. It is only because the wontons and fried noodles it makes are completely authentic Chinese style, so the compatriots in Paris are always willing to invite you to experience this taste of home. There are five or six such small restaurants in this small alley. The business is equally sluggish, and they are all heading towards a declining fate. Except for a few compatriots living nearby as regular customers, few French people patronize them. But if you want to know the true situation of the lives of most overseas Chinese in France, you can investigate here. Strictly speaking, this is not a formal business. It is just a few unemployed people from Qingtian County, Zhejiang, who are stranded overseas, helping each other and doing some scattered business to make a living. Speaking of the people of Qingtian in France, many people will naturally think of a group of adventurers full of romance who walked through Siberia, crossed the Ural Mountains, and relied on selling stones for a living along the way. The reporter was also attracted by this romantic story, and took advantage of the short stay in Paris to specifically visit this group of Qingtian people several times, hoping to obtain some story materials narrated by them personally to report to the people of the country. However, after several investigations, it was discovered that the people who relied on selling Qingtian stones to walk to Europe are already an old generation's past events. The people who personally experienced it have either died or are sick, and the surviving elders who can be found are only four in Paris. Even these four surviving adventurers are now sick, disabled, and old, and their actions are very inconvenient. The reporter made several appointment requests, but they were not fulfilled, which is a great regret. Although the more than 400 Qingtian people who now live near this small alley have also fled to this foreign land in order to escape the pressure of life and find a way out, their experiences are far less heroic than those of the previous generation. Therefore, there are no romantic adventure stories worth praising among them, only some tragic experiences of being tortured by life and mistreated by foreigners, which may arouse the pity of kind-hearted people, but will not win the admiration of those who worship heroes.

It is said that there are about 2,000 overseas Chinese in France (referring to Chinese people who make a living in France, not the dignitaries who fly in today and fly away tomorrow), most of whom are from Guangdong and Qingtian, Zhejiang. Among them, about 800 live in Paris, with the number of people from Guangdong and Zhejiang being comparable. Because of different residences and different ways of making a living, they rarely interact with each other. The people of Guangdong seem to be better at business management, so among the people of Guangdong, there are occasionally families with small wealth. The several decent Chinese restaurants in Paris now, except for Shenjiang Paradise, are all opened by people from Guangdong. The people of Zhejiang are almost all from Qingtian, and they all live in the small alleys near the Lyon station, and they are almost all extremely poor. Although they also barely support five or six noodle restaurants, the business is very sluggish, and it is difficult to maintain the expenses of a family. The time they arrived in France varies. Among the more than 20 people the reporter spoke with, the earliest arrived in France 18 years ago, and the latest 11 years ago. So when they came, they were young, energetic, and adventurous adults, but now they are gradually aging, and they cannot help but think of their homeland. The motives for coming were different. Most of them took a boat from Shanghai to France to work as laborers. After World War I, France lacked labor and needed to recruit it overseas, and the people of Qingtian flocked to France to take risks because of the promotion of the previous generation of stone sellers. For more than ten years, they have barely maintained their lives from hand to mouth. Those who are relatively lucky and can save a little have married French wives. According to what they told the reporter, about half of them have started families in Paris, and most of them have children. The oldest is 18 years old and is studying in a French school, and is considered a French person. Since the end of the war, a total of more than 30 people have recently returned home with their families, which is obviously the luckiest of them and is envied by their peers. Those who remain in France now do not have the money to return home, and at the same time, they are not sure of making a living after returning home, so they can only continue to remain in France, living one day at a time.

Strict Restrictions by the French

During the German occupation, the Germans did not discriminate or persecute the compatriots excessively. They were allowed to continue operating small businesses and small restaurants. Those who lost their jobs in factories because the factories were closed also switched to doing small businesses, and their lives could still be barely maintained. It is said that during the German occupation, not a single compatriot died at the hands of the Germans. However, once French bandits came to rob a small noodle shop, and a dispute arose, resulting in one compatriot being shot dead by the bandits. The murderer has not been apprehended to this day, and the case has not been closed. However, the Germans conscripted Chinese laborers to build defensive fortifications near Paris. On two occasions, they were attacked by Allied aircraft, and a total of more than 30 compatriots died. In 1940, Germany ordered the Vichy government to send young men to Germany for military service. The Vichy authorities sent compatriots to make up the numbers. They had already been sent to Berlin, but because the German authorities insisted on only wanting French people, the compatriots who had already been sent were sent back to French territory, and they were safe and sound.

Now that France has been restored, factories have resumed operations one after another, and some compatriots have returned to the factories. The daily wage is about 300 francs (equivalent to 60 or 70 cents in US dollars), which is only enough for personal subsistence. Because most compatriots cannot read French, they cannot learn or take on more sophisticated and specialized work, and the wages cannot be high. The rest of the people make belts, wallets, and the like and sell them on the street, and they can also earn 400 or 500 francs a day. What they feel most painful about is that whether doing business or working in France, they must obtain a permit from the French government, otherwise they will be punished if they are caught doing it secretly. And when these compatriots arrived in France, their passports were not properly handled, and they had no idea about the current system of laws and regulations in France; therefore, they were often punished for minor offenses. Local students publish a mimeographed Chinese newspaper, and the overseas Chinese rely entirely on this newspaper to understand the national situation. They also know that China is now one of the five major powers, so they sent people to the embassy to request that the embassy negotiate with the French authorities to issue permits for compatriots to work or do business, but our current embassy in Paris does not pay attention to the requests of these poor compatriots at all. Therefore, in March of this year, they held a meeting and decided to submit four petitions to the country, one to Chairman Chiang, one to President Song, one to Minister Wang, and the other to Minister Chen Cixiu based on hometown relationships, requesting relief and asking them to order the embassy to assist in handling the work permits. The replies from Minister Song and Minister Wang came very early, saying that they had separately sent letters to the embassy to handle the matter at the appropriate time. The compatriots also found out from the embassy that the letters from Song and Wang had indeed been sent to the embassy in April, but the embassy did not take any action. This time, Minister Wang came to Paris in person for the European Peace Conference, and the compatriots sent representatives to present the actual situation in person. On September 3, the Paris overseas Chinese held a meeting to celebrate our country's Victory Day. That evening, the compatriots took the opportunity to invite Minister Wang to attend the meeting and give instructions, giving Minister Wang the opportunity to see the overseas Chinese community in person and urging the embassy to work hard to negotiate. The situation may improve somewhat in the future.

Now the overseas Chinese in Paris have different opinions on the matter of wanting to return to their motherland. People who still have brothers and sisters in the country mostly want to go back to visit, so they are all looking forward to the opportunity to return home. On the other hand, they believe that if they can find a job in France and earn 300 or 400 francs a day, then although life is hard, at least they will not starve. Before leaving the country, they had already tasted the bitterness of unemployment, and they do not believe that they will have better luck this time when they go back. Even if they find a job in the country, the remuneration and treatment cannot keep up with that in France, so they would rather continue to work in France. Both of these hopes are based on facts. If the authorities can help these compatriots, it seems that both paths can be pursued at the same time.

### A Tragedy of Optimism

— Hualin

It is impossible in life to satisfy one's own happiness; one can only "beautify" life with a transcendent spirit, breaking free from all realistic shackles, using courage to escape all the depression of life! A tragic life should not be painful any longer! We should be happy, we should laugh, we should sing and dance. We roar on lonely mountaintops, we swim in the tide of the raging sea. We savor the taste of pain, making it the material of our songs. We jump into the abyss of darkness, making it our human game. Nietzsche said: "Those with great desires have great contempt and great disgust." To heal pessimism, one should overcome it with a transcendent and progressive spirit of happiness! Therefore, he advocated the "Übermensch," because when people reach their greatest despair, they will generate the greatest new hope!

"Megalos's" sunset sculpture is a male figure. He turns to close his eyes, unwilling to see the terrifying situation of internal turmoil at the time, hoping that it will die, leaving only a little memorial. Juyou also said in his philosophical poem, I follow my path, walking towards a distant future. The brilliance of dawn, the beautiful future, is my precious life! Why is it so warm? Because it is still distant, which shows that only hope is sweet! He also said, "The highest joy almost brings tears!" These transcendent feelings all contain much pain. Nietzsche also said, "To know the greatest joy, one must first know the greatest pain." Juyou also had the same sentiment, saying that earnestness creates pain. Perhaps reduced to death, no matter what happens, my eyes will always look straight ahead!

A tragedy of optimism: that is, using a transcendent spirit to prevent life from falling into depravity and prison, using courage to escape the shackles and depression of reality! Cheer! Sing! Grow wings and dance! Dance on water, fall on fire, dance on all the injustices of the world! Treading on the rhythm of the universe, experiencing the game of humanity. My shadow calls to me, shrouding me, it plunges me into the abyss of darkness, but I can leave it, escape it, and save myself, because I have great contempt and great disgust. I raise my head, raise my hands, and my legs also jump up, as if growing wings, flying to the mountaintop, flying to the distant morning star. I bow my head and smile at the abyss. Wise philosophers are always laughing there! "Laugh!" Like an innocent child!

### In Fast Motion

— By Czech Čapek, translated by Jiang Si

Catching a Moth

A person sits with a book or newspaper in his hand; suddenly, he raises his head, his eyes following something in the air, as if looking at an invisible picture. Then he jumps up, grabs with his hand, and then kneels down, slapping the ground with his palm. He jumps up again, grabbing at emptiness; runs to a corner, clapping his hands; slaps the wall, and then carefully looks at his hand. Then, helplessly shaking his head, he walks back and sits down, suspiciously looking at the corner he just slapped. Three seconds later, he leaps up again, jumps into the air, clapping his hands, falls to the ground, hitting the walls and furniture, frantically waving his arms, jumping around, his head turning back and forth, and then sits down again. Five seconds later, he jumps up again, performing this ritualistic dance all over again.

Chasing a Tram

For this, you need a tram that is about to depart. At this time, a person going to the tram stop turns around and starts moving his legs faster, the motion like a pair of scissors; then he skips lightly like a ballet dancer, and then runs at a slow pace, smiling as if he is just playing around. Then, he holds down his hat with one hand and starts running as hard as he can. The tram, which did indeed wait for a while, now departs at full speed. The person chasing the tram runs a few steps in despair, but the tram rumbles past indifferently. At this time, the person chasing the tram comes to the conclusion that he cannot catch the tram, his enthusiasm collapses and disappears; he runs a few steps forward with weak leaps, and then stops, waving his hand at the departed tram, as if saying: "It doesn't matter, go to hell if you want, go! I can wait for the second tram—a better one than you!"

Walking the Dog

A person walking a dog often thinks he is leading the dog, rather than the dog pulling him. If the dog wants to smell something, its owner also stops, looking at the surrounding buildings or scenery; and when the dog squats down to relieve itself (which lowers the status of its owner), its owner slowly lights a cigarette, or pretends that he needs to stay here for a while, indicating that he is pondering something, completely unaware of what his dog is doing at this time.

Stumbling

A person slips on something, or suddenly changes the rhythm of his steps for some completely external reason. He often waves his arms in surprise, as if trying to grab someone, and suddenly uses the most undignified haste to regain his lost balance. But after doing so, he continues walking with a noticeable and energetic agility, as if saying to everyone passing by: "Hey, what are you staring at? Did you think I was going to fall? Hey, I didn't fall, but what does that have to do with you? Can't you see that I'm striding forward now?"

Avoiding Mud

A person crossing a puddle of mud really does this. He first stands by the puddle thinking of a way to cross it without getting his feet wet; then he takes light steps, like a cat, stepping only on his toes; then he concentrates, jumping in the puddle, changing direction, and proceeding very carefully; however, unexpectedly, he happens to step in the deepest and dirtiest part of the mud. At that time, the person trying to avoid the mud shows a "ouch" face; he stops dejectedly for a while, and then struggles out of the deepest part of the puddle. In the long journey, like the journey of life, this is called accepting fate.

### Shrimp Vendor Girl

— By English Hogarth

### Office Gossip

— Qi Kuo

The office is the easiest place to be bored. When busy, everyone shouts that there are not enough people, and if more people are not added, they will have to ask for leave to go home and see their uncles; when idle, everyone is redundant, as if an office only needs three or five people to cope with ease.

So everyone stops complaining, watching those three or five people lowering their heads and working on official business, while the rest find their own ways to pass the time.

Old Liang, who is most particular about calligraphy, is the first to pull out a sheet of official stationery from the wire basket, dip his small writing brush in thick ink, and meticulously copy his most proud "Diamond Sutra":

"Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was in the Jetavana Grove of Anathapindika's Park in Sravasti..."

This is his greatest invention: writing small characters both cultivates temperament and deceives the boss's eyes. While others are chatting idly, only Old Liang, Old Liang is always bent over, writing stroke by stroke, as if he has official business to do, perhaps even busier than those three or five gentlemen who are busy with official business.

Others naturally pull out a copy or two of square weekly magazines from their drawers to give themselves a little relaxation, but they all remain silent and do not disturb others. Only Little Wang and Little Li, the youngest and most frivolous, put their feet on the desk, chatting about everything under the sun, specializing in office news, and no one knows where they get so much. Those who like to talk love to talk, and those who like to listen love to listen, no one investigates the source, anyway, just pass the time.

Little Wang said:

"Little Li, Section Chief Xue's luck has come, he recently got a new girl, a singer..."

"Hmm!"

Little Li, in order to hear more clearly, tilted his body, and the foot and chair propped up on the desk lost their balance, suddenly leaning onto Old Liang sitting behind him. Old Liang was writing:

"...begging completed..."

The tail of the word "completed" was stretched very long, like a fox running in the snow with its tail dragging. Old Liang was very unhappy, picked up the sheet of official stationery, turned around, and pointed it to Little Li:

"Look, a good Diamond Sutra... Young people don't leave any oral virtue, specializing in talking about other people's privacy..."

Little Li clapped his hands and laughed:

"I know, Old Liang, we both understand each other, I won't talk about you!"

Old Liang frowned:

"Me? A real man sits upright and stands upright, not afraid of you talking!"

Little Li nodded hurriedly:

"Okay, okay, I said too much. Yesterday at the entrance of the welfare company,... Aiya... I won't say it, I won't say it..."

"Pah!"

Old Liang spat into the spittoon, then sat up straight again, pulled out a new sheet of official stationery from the wire basket:

"People just need to sit upright and stand upright,... um..."

He dipped his small writing brush in the inkpad and began to copy his Diamond Sutra again!

"Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was in the Jetavana Grove of Anathapindika's Park in Sravasti..."

Old Liang could spare Little Li, but Little Wang couldn't spare Little Li. He leaned over hard, tugged at Little Li's sleeve, and asked in a low voice:

"What? Little Li, what? Old Liang's romance?..."

Little Li pretended to pull his sleeve away, acting very serious:

"Nothing, promised others, not to say, a gentleman's agreement!"

The difficulty was that Little Wang and Little Li also had a gentleman's agreement, so Little Li had to say softly:

"Actually, there's nothing much, yesterday I saw Old Liang accompanying a young lady at the entrance of the Great Brightness Theater..."

Before he could finish speaking, Little Wang jumped up:

"Big news, Old Liang is a gentleman... Wow!..."

With such big news in his stomach, Little Wang simply couldn't hold it in. He left Little Li and circled around the office, whispering in Zhang Fang's ear:

"Old Liang has a romance, he hooked up with a pretty girl yesterday and went to see a movie at the Great Brightness."

Zhang Fang laughed, raised his head and looked at Old Liang's back, who was writing the Diamond Sutra, a little disbelieving, such an old man?

"Really?"

Little Wang patted his chest:

"Lie to you? Little Li saw it with his own eyes!"

Yue Daoming, sitting opposite Zhang Fang, curiously leaned over:

"What's the matter, what's the matter?"

Little Wang raised his thumb:

"Go ask him!" He circled around to another place.

Zhang Fang leaned his head hard towards Yue Daoming, and said softly:

"Old Liang, that gentleman, is also playing with women. Yesterday someone saw him accompanying a very pretty girl, very intimately, watching a movie at the Great Brightness.

"And after the movie?"

"Maybe they had dinner at the International Hotel, who knows..."

Yue Daoming turned his head with a belly full of laughter, patted Yan Tizhi's shoulder:

"Old Liang, this person really deserves a second look, yesterday someone saw him hugging a pretty girl, watching a movie at the Great Brightness, and after the movie they went to the International Hotel to eat, wow!"

Yan Tizhi stuck out his tongue.

"Not sure, not sure, did you go into the International Hotel with him?"

Yue Daoming shook his head; Yan Tizhi was very proud:

"That's right, how can you guarantee that he didn't rent a room?"

He couldn't sit still any longer, threw down the tabloid he was holding, and dragged his chair to the desk next to him:

"Ah Huang, Ah Huang, I'll report a piece of news to you, do you know this Old Liang?"

"That's a gentleman, all he knows is writing the Diamond Sutra all day long."

The one who stuck out his tongue!

"Now he has a romance, yesterday he and a girl watched a movie at the Great Brightness, the two of them hugging, um, maybe they even rented a car, and after the movie they went to the International Hotel to rent a room..."

Ah Huang turned his head to look at Old Liang, and then turned to another corner: Old Xu was sitting there calculating with an abacus, not knowing whether he was calculating official accounts or private accounts. Ah Huang walked over with a straight face!

"Old Xu, I have something to talk to you about."

Old Xu hurriedly pushed the abacus aside:

"Please, please..."

"Your brother-in-law is having an affair, yesterday someone saw... um... at the International Hotel... We don't ask about relatives, but you have to persuade him, his reputation as a gentleman these past few years has not been easy..."

Old Xu left before it was time to leave the office. When Old Liang returned home, Mrs. Liang was lying on the bed crying, Old Xu was sitting there sighing, and when he saw Old Liang, he sighed listlessly:

"Brother-in-law, you're too wrong, you've been married to my sister for more than ten years..."

Mrs. Liang suddenly jumped up from the bed:

"You don't have to talk to him, if he can do it, I can do it too, I'll fight him!"

She crashed into Old Liang, and the two fell on the floor, shaking the floor loudly.

Old Liang's niece ran over from the small room next door and said:

"Uncle and aunt, don't be angry, I heard what you just said, it's not true, yesterday afternoon my uncle accompanied me to buy things, I was with my uncle all afternoon, and my uncle accompanied me back, and my uncle hasn't left the house since he came back, my aunt also knows that."

The rice in the kitchen was already burnt, and a burnt fragrance rose upstairs.

### An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 57

— Ye Jingfeng

Chapter Five: Plunging into the Devil's Den

That evening (July 28th), when I was about to leave Changxindian, I called No. 04 again to reiterate the things he should handle, telling him to try his best to handle them properly. After finishing the matter, he could come to Beiping to find me, and I told him the location, saving him the trouble of exploring.

At this time, within a circle of thirty to forty miles around Beiping, it could be said to be very chaotic. Gunshots and artillery fire, crazy hissing and roaring, several places were emitting smoke and fire. On the road into the city, some sections were as calm as ancient roads, and some sections had scouts coming and going like shuttles, shouting orders, mixed with gunshots, erupting at the same time; in the dim night, along the road, one could often see groups of men, women, old and young, on the side of the road, like ghostly shadows, carrying heavy steps, heading in the direction they thought was safe, sighs mixed with the cries of children.

A little after ten o'clock, I returned to Mr. W's headquarters. At this time, probably because he was busy, his office had two more message receivers, one answering the phone, and one receiving and sending secret telegrams. I briefly told him about the Changxindian incident; and asked him to quickly point out a method that could settle Dingyuan's problem. This was not because I was unfamiliar with the situation in Beiping, in fact, I was putting the entire burden of Dingyuan on his shoulders; because I had to leave for Tongxian immediately. Mr. W did not hesitate slightly, and immediately ordered someone to send Dingyuan to the Xiehe Hospital, saying that he would think of a solution after seeing the situation in a short period of time.

He also briefly told me about the situation in Beiping—Song Zheyuan had arrived in Zhuozhou, and the surviving generals of the 29th Army also retreated with him, Zhang Zizhong was now in the city, shouldering the heavy burden of governing the military and politics, and Tianjin was the responsibility of Li Wentian—he said, "It's a pity that this kind of measure was handled a little too late, and many generals, soldiers and civilians were sacrificed in vain."

I raised the issue of going to Tongxian and asked him to send a car and two assistants to go with me. He did everything, and mentioned a few points that should be paid attention to. He said that the entire territory of Tongxian was a hell, if the meaning of "hell" was so chaotic, terrifying, dark, and miserable. From Beiping to Tongxian, a distance of more than forty miles, the devil's hands of the Japanese and puppets were everywhere, seizing and slaughtering at will. The city of Tongxian was simply a world of ghosts and monsters, and if one's eyes were not bright, every step was thorns and traps.

"Whether from a political or humanitarian standpoint, we must use all our strength to turn it over." Mr. W said calmly, "It's a pity that... we originally planned to implement the planned actions early this morning, before the Japanese's 'dawn attack', to disrupt the little devils' rear lines and extinguish their enthusiasm. This would also have a considerable effect in military affairs; it's a pity that Yaoqun and Little Tiger went a day late, and the arrangement was a little bit off."

At this time, I was lying on a soft chair to rest, eating something to restore my strength, while listening to him speak. When I heard him mention Yaoqun and Little Tiger, I immediately sat up, wanting to ask him a few questions.

Mr. W immediately stretched out his hand to make a gesture of pressing down and said, "You should still lie down and rest, I know what you want to say—you think that Yaoqun and Little Tiger, those two young children, how could their actions have such a big relationship, how could going a day late delay the entire action? In this way, our secret work is simply a bit of a child's play, isn't it?" As he said this, he immediately took out two letters from the document stack:

### Marguerite Audoux

— Da Chun

Marguerite Audoux lost her parents when she was young and was raised by nuns in an orphanage. After leaving the orphanage, she worked as a shepherdess on a farm in Sologne. Later, she went to Paris to work as a seamstress. Around 1910, she wrote two autobiographical novels about her childhood experiences and working life in a simple and touching realistic style, namely Marie Claire and Marie Claire's Studio (L'atelier de Marie Claire). After the publication of her debut work, Marie Claire, it immediately shocked the literary world, and Mirbeau considered it a masterpiece. As a result, she received the French "Femina Literary Prize" (Prix Femina) in 1910, and the book has sold more than 100,000 copies to date. After Marie Claire's success, she lived alone on the top floor of a small house on Leopold Robert Street in the Montparnasse district, until the last few months before her death.

Audoux knew deeply that in order to live, she had to work hard, so from then on, she wrote day and night, and could also relieve her loneliness. She spent a total of thirty years of writing life. Her appearance in the literary world was as sudden as lightning. Her mission was to spread that rare thing among us: purity. Mirbeau once said to her:

"You, you are an angel!"

This sentence was not an exaggeration. In that poor little house, she often received all visitors with a compassionate heart: her friends, great writers, great artists, or unknown people. When those people first arrived at her place, they always felt burdened with fatigue and frustration. But after listening to her conversation and looking at her face, they gradually felt relieved and felt that everything had been washed away. She would often first open the green curtain in front of the window in the small dining room, point to the flower pots that decorated the window sill, and say to the visitor in an appetizing Sologne accent: "Please take a look at my garden first! Then we'll chat."

In winter, a heart-shaped small fire embers "snored beside her desk. While mixing the fire in "carefully", she handed a large willow armchair—this was her only good armchair—to her friend to sit on, and sat beside her, smiling and said:

"Please tell me all your little troubles." and clear, a harmonious and beautiful sentence. When Charles-Louis Philippe, Francis Jourdain, Mirbeau and many other writers saw her repeatedly revised exercise books and appreciated her works, they were all surprised. I can't help but ask: Who taught this seamstress such writing and such a style?

Audoux replied to this strange question: "I don't know at all! I didn't learn at all! But I dreamed very hard in my life!"

This is her mystery. She dreamed very hard, and suffered very hard? She leaned over the desk with a sick body, her sick eyes staring at the paper, and went to the world she had lost to find those voices, those fragrances, and those lights.

This honorable woman did not think of a little bright sunshine until the end of October 1936, when she went to Saint-Raphael to recuperate. She lived there for three months, and finally died there on February 1, 1937. Audoux's departure from the world was not only the loss of a great writer in the French literary world, but also the loss of a pure light in the world.

She worked hard all her life, and the masterpieces she left us, in addition to the above two books, also include Fiancée, From City to Mill, and the belatedly completed Dovcelumiere, etc., Dovcelumiere is another Marie Claire-type work.

### Comforting and Encouraging Colleagues

— Shao Fu

Here is a small story to encourage our colleagues in the field.

That was the United Nations Food Conference held in Hot Springs, Virginia, USA in the summer of 1944. The meeting was held on May 18, and it was decided in advance that representatives from all countries should not meet with newspaper reporters, and new reporters were restricted from entering the Garden Hotel where the representatives were staying. This decision naturally aroused protests from reporters from various countries, and the New York Times frankly criticized "this will create a bad precedent"...... After the reporters' requests, the US Congress's debate, and the protests of most newspaper editorials, finally, the US government finally gave in and cancelled those bans.

Freedom will not fall from the sky, it must be fought for. If our freedom of the press does not harm the freedom of others, we are determined to fight for freedom. The United Nations Food Conference is just one of thousands of examples.

### The Lie Detector

— Traveler

According to the Shen Bao of October 5th, the police bureau recently planned to allocate a portion of the prize money donated by Mr. Rong Desheng to purchase equipment for criminal police. Among the new equipment is a lie detector. It is said that this machine can immediately determine the truthfulness of a suspect's statement during interrogation. The so-called lie detector has been used since 1921 at the Berkeley Police Department in California, USA. It has more than a decade of history, and with its assistance, police have narrowed the scope of investigations, saving a lot of time, money, and energy. Therefore, it has become a common criminal investigation tool for police departments in Europe and the United States. However, in the cosmopolitan city of Shanghai, it is only now being considered for purchase. Here is a brief introduction to its principles, structure, and uses:

You Can't Lie

The lie detector is not a magical device. It is simply a machine that records changes in the human body, just like a thermometer or stethoscope used by doctors during diagnosis. During the interrogation of criminals, it can be used to determine whether the criminal's statement is true based on its recordings, because changes in the human body are caused by the liar's emotional changes. In ancient China, when interrogating suspects, people often gave them rice flour to chew and spit out. If the spit-out rice flour was dry, they were considered guilty. A hundred years ago, an American prison guard named Coman provided a scientific explanation for this Chinese method of interrogating criminals: Coman experimented with dogs and found that fear, anger, and pain could completely stop the peristaltic movement of saliva in the internal organs, preventing it from flowing into the mouth. Even if the rice flour was held in the mouth for a long time, it would not become moist. The current lie detector is based on this principle.

The current lie detector is divided into three parts: one part measures and records the subject's breathing, one part records changes in pulse rate and blood pressure, and another part measures subtle electrical changes in the skin's electrical resistance. These bodily changes can be recorded simultaneously on a moving piece of paper, which is driven by an electric motor (whose normal speed is directly proportional to the current frequency). Each part is an independent unit and can act alone. When these three parts work together, they create the so-called lie detector.

The results recorded by the lie detector, after a clear explanation by the staff, can determine whether the person being investigated is telling the truth. Therefore, a staff member using a lie detector must have a precise mind, calm observation, and rigorous training to be able to use this delicate machine effectively, just like the qualities a good doctor should possess.

Confessing Without Being Beaten

The uses of the lie detector are truly vast: it can find stolen property, it can check fugitives who are being pursued elsewhere, it can release innocent people who have been implicated, it can help examine witnesses to see if their evidence is accurate, it can help police officers find the culprit, it can investigate cunning criminals who kill their wives and falsely report to the police that their wives were killed, and it can investigate corrupt officials who embezzle warehouse goods and destroy them with fire.

The first case solved by the Berkeley Police Department using a lie detector was a murder case: a young girl in Berkeley was killed, and all indications pointed to a crime of passion. The police brought all the suspects into the station and interrogated them individually, but they could not find out who the murderer was. They had to resort to the newly invented lie detector. The first few people tested did not show any criminal reactions in their bodies. When the ninth person was tested, the diagrams drawn on the lie detector proved that he was guilty. They showed him the records, and he confessed without hesitation. If ordinary investigation methods had been used to solve this case, it would have taken much more time and effort. Furthermore, in this situation, if there had been no lie detector, the case probably could not have been solved so easily.

### About Steel Wire Recording

— Fei Ran

Upon seeing a section in today's newspaper (October 6th Shen Bao) about Mr. Chen Deliang being specially invited to speak at the Chinese Export Commodities Exhibition on "Steel Wire Recording," I was reminded of some things about this steel wire recording!

Our country's steel wire recording has just been successfully invented by Mr. Chen Deliang, truly a highlight of our country's scientific community!

However, steel wire recording already existed in the United States, but they only used it for military purposes and kept it a great secret, refusing to reveal any information about it. Therefore, Mr. Chen personally created it himself.

In fact, the principle of steel wire recording was invented fifty years ago by the Dane Poulsgo, but no one paid attention to it at the time. It was not until the Second World War that the Soviet youth Camras officially invented and successfully created it in the United States, truly marking a great revolution in the science of recording.

Currently, there are three types of recording methods: one is mechanical, which is the most common type of record currently used. It records sound on a wax disc, but it is damaged after being used several times, and all of its components are very bulky, making it inconvenient in certain venues, and it can only record for three minutes. The second type is optical, which is mostly used in sound films. It is a thin line of shadow next to the film, but sound is emitted through the action of light and electricity. Of course, the price is also very expensive. The third type is steel wire recording, also called magnetic recording. It relies only on an extremely thin steel wire, but it is not an ordinary steel wire. It is formed through a strong or weak magnetism. When it is played back, the steel only needs to be reinserted between the poles of an electromagnet at a speed of about two feet per second, and then the sound can be emitted through an amplifier, and the sound is very clear. At the same time, one recording can be repeated 200,000 times without changing, and it is still very clear. When it is no longer needed, it can be automatically erased by a magnetization method, and then a second recording can be made.

In short, this method is equivalent to writing white words on a blackboard, and it is convenient and quick to use. For example, if a dignitary gives a speech somewhere, it can be recorded at the time and immediately taken to the broadcasting station to be broadcast, without having to repeat making any plates, and it can be broadcast for at least an hour or more.

Therefore, everything at the recent San Francisco Peace Conference used this steel wire recording as a record.

### Sleeping Through a Century

— Ben Xun

After reading Mr. Jia Ling's "Sleeping for Thirty-Nine Years" in the "Free Talk" column of this newspaper on October 6th, I couldn't help but recall an interesting story I heard when I was in school, "Sleeping Through a Century." My classmate said: "If you go to bed before 12:00 PM on December 31, 1999, and wake up the next day, it will be January 1, 2000. Wouldn't that mean he slept from the 20th century to the 21st century?"

### "Many Monks and Taoists in the Gates of Hell"

— Jian Mang

Not long ago, the Director of Civil Affairs, Mr. Zhang Xiaosong, proposed borrowing or allocating abandoned temples and monasteries as offices because there was no land for offices in various districts, implying the benefit of public service. Before he could finish speaking, it aroused the true fire of samadhi of bald-headed monks, who held meetings, formed teams, paraded, and petitioned, making a big splash and causing a city-wide uproar, violating the Buddhist principle of "benefiting oneself and benefiting others." Examining the Sangha, there are many who cultivate "precepts, concentration, and wisdom," but there are also many who violate the five precepts of "killing, stealing, adultery, lying, and drinking," especially the monks in Shanghai. As the saying goes, "Many monks and Taoists in the gates of hell." Indeed, here is an order from Emperor Taizu of Ming regarding Chinese monks after the war:

"Today, most of the monks in the world are mixed with the common people, and many are even worse than the common people. They enter the religion but ruin their conduct. It is reasonable to purify their ranks and complete their sect. After the order is issued, Chan practitioners should practice Chan, lecturers should lecture, and Yogis should practice Yoga, each according to their sect. Those with wives and children who wish to return to secular life may do so, and those who wish to practice [religious practice] may do so. After this order, anyone who dares not enter the monastery, still privately has family members, secretly lives among the people, and is reported to the government or caught by officials, must have their "heads cut off" to show the public. Those who harbor them will be exiled three thousand li."

Historically, there was this Sangha law, which also illustrates the dark side of monks and Taoists, and the contempt that monks and nuns have suffered is not without reason. We should re-evaluate the hypocrisy and compassion of those who constantly chant Amitabha Buddha!

Miscellaneous Thoughts

### Horse Racing · Concubinage

— Fan Fu

The municipal government's expenditures exceed its income, so someone proposed restoring horse racing to increase government revenue. This publication conducted a public opinion poll, and the majority opposed the restoration. The city council also discussed this issue, and two opposing opinions emerged, which could not be resolved.

However, regardless of whether horse racing can be restored, the municipal government's deficit is an obvious fact, and ways to make up for it must be sought. The means and methods are nothing more than taxation and increased donations. For example, the current entertainment tax has directly affected the operation of theaters due to its increase.

It is said that the Hong Kong government is also experiencing an economic panic?

On September 23, the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce discussed the issue of "increasing tax revenue in Hong Kong" at a routine meeting. Yuan Jiancheng, a representative of the catering industry, immediately proposed a method that would "increase government revenue without increasing the burden on merchants and without affecting the prosperity of the market"—levying a "concubine tax."

Mr. Yuan also added: "I propose that anyone who takes a concubine should pay a tax of 20,000 yuan per person, with more taxes levied for more concubines. In this way, the Hong Kong government can broaden its tax base, and the general public will not increase their burden. Isn't that a win-win situation?"

Listening to Mr. Yuan's words, he seems quite confident. Hong Kong is, after all, a place where "high-class Chinese" gather. Taking a concubine is like buying a car or a foreign house, and it's not a big deal. Despite the fact that families in the disaster areas of the motherland are selling their wives and children, they can still have three wives and two concubines. Therefore, Mr. Yuan has foresight and is afraid of tax evasion, so he specifically added: "More taxes levied for more concubines."

But Hong Kong is, after all, a semi-changed Hong Kong. Otherwise, our "horse-protecting" gentlemen could write an article: "People use concubinage to collect taxes, why can't we rely on horse racing to collect donations!"

Important figures can fill the position of × Director, and can also concurrently hold the position of × Director, with three heads and six arms, and the able are overworked, which means that when one has achieved success, they can retire honorably, and holding a few titles can also create a real business, running a company, and the family that accumulates virtue has plenty of blessings, the more the better. People have the same mind, and there are ways to get in, and there is no way to stop them; no wonder a hole was left when the money was cast. To this day, "Brother Kong Fang" is still well-known to women and children, and famous at home and abroad.

Autumn wind blows, minds are confused, especially the ladies. First of all, the style of the coat has become a problem. Secondly, are the sleeves of the cheongsam inside long, short, or neither long nor short? From empty words of discussion to practical observation, referring to the progressive Western culture and researching the classical art of the national essence, they still dare not decide. They are even more humble and eager to learn, and they are not ashamed to ask the willows by the road and flowers on the wall. Finally, they must consult the master tailor and listen to the great cut. Last year was short, this year is long, next year is short, and the year after next year is long. In the eyes of men, the old bottle is filled with old wine, and there is no epoch-making special change. The men's coats on the back are sometimes separated and sometimes closed, called "1946", but in reality, "it is already old".

After a long period of division, there must be unity, and after a long period of unity, there must be division. This is generally the way of the world.

Teachers diligently guide, from knowledge to habits to health, everything is painstaking, and still in a state of [hard work and difficulty], with little food and a heavy burden, the mission is too great; therefore, teachers evade, and "floating capital" is filled, so education is in danger.

In the past, teachers from private schools ran to public schools, but now, it is exactly the opposite; it is not that the teachers are rebelling, but that life is rebelling. Life, i.e., treatment, has replaced the imported phrase "life is education." Alas!

### The American Oil King - A Wealthy Man Skilled at Health Preservation

— Written by Dale Carnegie, translated by Zhuang Wenye

John Rockefeller performed three amazing feats in his life:

First, when Mr. Rockefeller first started out, he was a tenant farmer who earned only four cents an hour, but he eventually became a "king," the person who accumulated the most wealth in all of history. At that time, there were fewer than six millionaires in the United States; while Mr. Rockefeller alone accumulated between 100 million and 200 million US dollars in assets.

Second, Mr. Rockefeller donated more money than anyone else in history; from birth to death, he donated a total of 750 million US dollars, an average of 75 cents donated every minute, day and night.

Third, Mr. Rockefeller's lifespan reached the high age of ninety-seven. Among white people with millions of assets in the world, only thirty can live to the age of ninety-seven. And at this advanced age, without needing dentures, I am afraid that there is no second person among these thirty people. Mr. Rockefeller, at the age of ninety-seven, still did not have a single denture in his mouth.

The Secret to Longevity

What is his secret to longevity? Perhaps it is a tendency towards longevity given to him by nature! Perhaps this tendency is due to his calm mind and gentle temperament. He has never been angered in his life, nor has he ever been impatient. When he was managing the Mobil Corporation, there was a couch in his office at 26 Broadway. Every noon, he would take a nap on this couch for half an hour. He continued to practice this daily nap until his death.

Mr. Rockefeller's physical strength gradually declined at the age of fifty-five, but this was the only gospel in the history of medicine. Because of his physical discomfort, he was motivated to donate money to the medical field as funds for exploring medical scholarship. Nearly one million US dollars were withdrawn from the entire Rockefeller Foundation every day to improve human health.

In the summer of 1932, cholera spread in China. At that time, the author happened to be in China. Who knew that in this country plagued by poverty and disease, I could actually step into the Peking Union Medical College Hospital, founded by the Rockefeller Foundation, to receive a vaccination. Only then did I realize that even in the farthest corner of Asia or the earth, there were traces of Mr. Rockefeller's good deeds.

Bodyguard Escort

Although Mr. Rockefeller was so charitable, he was one of the most hated people in the United States. He received no fewer than thousands of letters threatening his life, so he had to have bodyguards on guard and protection day and night. Even in this emotion of horror and danger, he was still able to calmly manage and plan great enterprises.

Mr. Rockefeller never received a university education. He studied at a secondary school at the age of sixteen, and then attended a commercial school for a few months, never having the opportunity to study again; however, he generously donated 50 million US dollars to the University of Chicago as expenses.

He is indeed an admirable figure. In his youth, he vowed not to gamble, smoke, drink, dance, or watch plays, which led to his success as a great entrepreneur.

Recalling Youth

Mr. Rockefeller's industrial development led to a continuous increase in his wealth. Almost one hundred US dollars or so in the improvement of his wealth. And Mr. Rockefeller's only great wish was not to increase his wealth, but to earnestly hope that he could have a long life of a century of cycles. He said that if he could hold a grand celebration for his hundredth birthday on July 8, 1939, he would lead a band on his property at Pocantico Hills, conducting them to play the song "When you and I were Young." Unfortunately, he passed away in 1936, otherwise, it would have been another great spectacle!
