### Large Forces Gather on the Songhua River Line; Northeast Communist Army Issues Mobilization Order; Offensive Launched in the Jitao Road Area

"Our Shenyang Dispatch, 26th" It is learned that the Communist army on the north bank of the Songhua River is actively preparing. The Nationalist army outposts north of Yongji are located at Daolajie on the north bank of the Songhua River. Communist forces are located ten li northwest of that street. On the Layen line from Shulan to Harbin, Communist forces are busy drilling and placing explosive holes in various bridges, preparing for demolition. The Communist army headquarters in Harbin has moved to Qiqihar. Harbin is currently using local circulation coupons from the Northeast Bank and puppet Manchukuo banknotes, as well as ten-yuan military scrip. Prices are gradually rising, and recently there have been many killings of former puppet Manchukuo officials and Japanese people.

"Our Peiping Dispatch, 26th" The Northeast Headquarters, currently in Shenyang, will move to Weichun in a month. The reason for the move is that the Nationalist army's recovered areas are gradually expanding and solidifying. There may also be new developments in northern Manchuria soon. The Headquarters feels it is difficult to direct the overall situation from Shenyang, hence the move north.

"Our Changchun Dispatch, 26th" Liang Huasheng came to Changchun yesterday. This afternoon, he inspected the Changchun police force at Jinshan Park.

The heavy oil express train between Shenyang and Changchun can arrive in eight hours, which is quite convenient for people. Currently, the Shenyang Railway Bureau manages the Yingkou, Haicheng, Anshan, and Shenyang lines. Bridges that were previously destroyed on various lines were all temporary structures. Currently, the Shenyang-Hailong line is beginning to construct permanent bridges with cement and steel. The Liaoyang-Gongyuan line has also begun permanent bridge construction. Thirty-eight bridges were destroyed on the Shenyang-Andong line and between Sujiatun and Benxi, and plans are being made to repair them. However, the double tracks will be dismantled to single tracks to cope with the current difficulties. According to the person in charge of the bureau, the projects that have already begun can be completed this winter.

### The United States Has No Intention of Withdrawing Its Troops Stationed in China;

It Is Believed That Stalin's Statements Are a Diplomatic Tactic

[Our Newspaper Report] Washington, 27th Radio Broadcast: Officials in Washington stated that the US government has no intention of withdrawing its troops from China at this time. Well-informed sources believe that Stalin's opposition to the stationing of US troops in China is merely a diplomatic tactic aimed at diverting the world's attention in order to conceal the Soviet Union's actions in Eastern Europe, rather than truly forcing the United States to withdraw from the Far East. Although the US government has kept the strength of US troops stationed in China a secret, officials openly acknowledge that there are only three to four thousand US Army personnel stationed in China, approximately twenty-two thousand Marines, and very few Navy personnel, totaling no more than twenty-five thousand. Unless there are unexpected developments, US troops will continue to be stationed in China until the work of maintaining order and mediating the Chinese civil war is completed. Government officials expressed the opinion that if the US Marines were to withdraw, the Communist army would cut off railway transportation lines and block the source of coal needed by industries in the Shanghai and Guangdong areas. They firmly believe that chaos would immediately break out throughout China after the US military withdrew. When asked if the US military was assisting the Nationalist army in engaging in the civil war, they replied, "The US military stationed in China maintains an absolutely neutral position," and emphasized that the US military no longer airlifts Chinese government troops, nor does it provide them with food and military supplies.

### Wu Tiecheng Criticizes Gromyko's Speech

[United Press, Nanjing, 27th] Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters, met with reporters today and criticized Soviet representative Gromyko's recent accusations in the Security Council, saying, "The stationing of US troops in China will not endanger world peace; on the contrary, it is conducive to promoting world peace. In my opinion, it is the stationing of foreign troops in a country's territory without the permission of that country's government that endangers world peace." Although he did not explicitly state it, he was clearly referring to the Soviet troops who are continuing to remain in certain locations in the Northeast in violation of treaty provisions. Wu stated, "The so-called 'Withdrawal from China Week' movement was initiated by a small number of pro-Communist elements in Shanghai and is merely a mouthpiece for Yan'an." He emphasized, "The US military has sacrificed its material comfort to come to China and continues to fulfill its important mission as an allied nation. We value the US military's past and future actions equally."

### The Chairman Receives US and British Ambassadors; Foreign Minister Wang Reports on the International Situation; Ambassador Stuart's Letter to Zhou Enlai Has Been Delivered to Shanghai

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] The atmosphere for political negotiations in the capital has become more intense due to the Chairman's return to Nanjing, but Zhou Enlai is still in Shanghai, so there has been no significant progress. Yesterday, Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart jointly sent a letter to Zhou Enlai. It is said that the contents are simple, expressing a deep hope that Zhou will return to Nanjing as soon as possible to discuss the overall situation of peace. This letter was sent by a special person dispatched by the Communist delegation on the night train of the 26th to Shanghai to be handed over to Zhou. Some people believe that there must be a clear reply to this letter as to whether the Communist Party will adhere to its prejudices, or have other opinions. Marshall visited Chairman Chiang at the official residence on Huangpu Road at 11:00 AM on the 27th for forty minutes. In the afternoon, at 5:30 PM, Ambassador Stuart, along with his personal advisor Chuan Jingbo, also visited the Chairman, leaving at 6:10 PM. The content of the talks all described the contact situation of the peace negotiations. It is heard that the current situation still focuses on the Communist Party's attitude, because the government's attitude of starting to solve the problem from a political perspective follows the advice of the mediator Ambassador Stuart, and was agreed to by the Communist Party, however, suddenly it reversed, I am afraid that before the three-person meeting is convened, the Communist Party will have new actions. Observers also believe that the Nationalists and Communists disputes must be resolved through political channels; not resolving the fundamental problem and talking about other things is putting the cart before the horse. Also, at 4:00 PM, Fu Jingbo visited Wu Dingchang and generally discussed the current situation.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] Ambassador Stuart had a one-hour meeting with the visiting Australian Ambassador on the 27th at 10 AM, and also held a tea party at his residence in the afternoon at 5:00 PM, to entertain American personnel in the churches, and invited Special Envoy Marshall to participate. The Ambassador was very interested in the church personnel. He will host a banquet at noon on the 28th for Bishop Yu Bin, who arrived in Nanjing from Hankou today, the Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, and Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Jiang Menglin. All of this is enough to show that the peace negotiations, which have been depressed for many days, are turning active.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 27th] Communist spokesman Wang Bingnan said that he received a letter from Ambassador Stuart yesterday, which has been forwarded to Shanghai for Zhou Enlai to read. A reply is expected today or tomorrow. Zhou's return to Nanjing and investigation depend on the results of the talks between Marshall and Chairman Chiang. The Communist Party still insists on restoring the Military Three-Person Group Meeting to discuss a comprehensive ceasefire; the Five-Person Group Meeting is not necessary.

[French News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] Chairman Chiang received Foreign Minister Wang Shijie on the 27th, keeping him for lunch. It is heard that Foreign Minister Wang reported to the Chairman on the participation in the Paris Peace Conference and the international situation.

### The Legislative Spirit of the May 5th Draft Constitution is Based on the Theory of the Five-Power Constitution;

The Revised Draft Reviewed by the Political Consultative Conference Still Needs Ratification

Wu Jingxiong's Talk

[Central News Agency, City Report] The National Assembly, which is attracting national attention, will open on November 12th. The main mission of the conference is to formulate and promulgate a constitution and implement constitutional government. The May 5th Draft Constitution, which was previously passed by the Legislative Yuan in three readings, will be submitted to the conference for discussion as the basis for generating a complete Constitution of the Republic of China. In order to understand the legislative spirit of the May 5th Draft Constitution and the comprehensive opinions of various parties, the reporter specifically visited Dr. Wu Luoneng, former Vice Chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee of the Legislative Yuan, yesterday to inquire about its content. He said: In order to make the country's politics enter the normal track of modernization, we must not ignore the importance of the constitutional period, but the prerequisite for implementing constitutional government must be a good constitution. In recent years, the government has attached great importance to the preparation work for the constitution. Under the main leadership of President Sun of the Legislative Yuan, after extensive consultation and consideration of the national conditions, after a long period of consideration, the procedure for the three readings produced a draft constitution of the Republic of China promulgated on May 5, referred to as the "May 5th Constitution". The basic spirit of the draft constitution emphasizes two points. (1) Based on the theory of the Five-Power Constitution. (2) Adopt the strengths of various democratic countries. Wu also said: The politics of Western countries are either biased towards the people having "power" and the government falling into a state of "inability", or the government has "ability" and the people lack "power." Therefore, the Founder of the Nation, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, placed special emphasis on the people having "power" and the government having "ability" in his Zhang Constitution. This is the latest and most valuable contribution to the theory of the constitution in democratic countries. The May 5th Draft Constitution is formulated based on this spirit. Recently, before the American legal authority Pound returned to the country, I had several studies with him on the May 5th Draft Constitution, and he was very satisfied with the draft constitution as a whole, especially the point that China implemented the presidential system, which he greatly appreciated. He once stated that the cabinet system does not seem to be applicable to China, because among the Western countries, the one that has been most successful in implementing the cabinet system is only the United Kingdom, but its main background is that the British people have undergone a hundred years of training in constitutional government and have developed the habit of constitutional government. The Chinese people cannot be compared with the British in this respect; he believes that if the May 5th Draft Constitution can be passed, China will become a very modern democratic country, and at the same time he believes that constitutional government focuses on implementation and cannot haggle over the wording, but only on whether it is suitable for the situation of the country. As for my opinion, the May 5th Draft Constitution is not unchangeable, but if there is any change, it must not depart from the theory of the Five-Power Constitution, which is the crystallization of the Founder of the Nation's lifelong efforts and political experience. At this point, the reporter raised several questions, which Wu answered as follows:

(Question) What are your views on whether the powers of this National Assembly are limited to constitution-making, or whether they also include concurrent constitutional implementation?

(Answer) I think: (1) It is not easy to convene the National Assembly. (2) It is easier to discover the shortcomings of the constitution and facilitate amendments if the same institution makes the constitution and implements it concurrently. Therefore, I advocate that the powers of this National Assembly are best to make the constitution and implement it concurrently.

(Question) Is there a standing institution during the adjournment of the National Assembly?

(Answer) If another standing institution is established, I am afraid it will create a "supreme government" and fail to sell the theory of separation of "power" and "ability."

(Question) What are the views of the Political Consultative Conference's Constitution Review Committee on the May 5th Draft Constitution?

(Answer) The results of the committee's review are not far from the original legislative spirit of the May 5th Draft Constitution. At that time, there was an understanding among the various parties and factions that the proposed revised draft was not a final conclusion and must be ratified by the highest authorities of the various parties and factions. The most important revision was to add a chapter on "the powers of the central government and the provinces" to the draft constitution.

### Proposals from Councilor Yin Shuxian and Others: Exchange Rates Should Not Be Further Devalued; the Council's Standing Committee Resolved to Submit the Issue to a Subcommittee for Review; Requesting the Government to Provide Relief to Disaster-Stricken Provinces Such as Yunnan and Shanxi

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 27th] The 9th regular meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Consultative Council was held on the morning of the 27th on the second floor of the National Assembly Hall. Attendees included Yin Shuxian and Fan Yusui, among others. Presided over by Chairman Shao Lizi, Minister of Judicial Administration Xie Guansheng reported on the latest judicial administration measures and the handling of traitor cases, stating briefly: Regarding the restoration of judicial organs, from October of last year to August of this year, a total of 275 units have relocated back to their original locations to conduct business. These include 12 High Courts, 16 High Branch Courts, 92 District Courts, and 155 Judicial Offices. Regarding the reserve of judicial personnel, a judicial personnel examination was held once last year, and 181 people were admitted. In the first examination this year, 403 people were admitted. The judicial groups of various universities can admit approximately 139 people. Currently, 190 registered judicial officials have been found qualified after review, including 102 judges and 28 military judicial personnel. Regarding the handling of traitor cases, Xie stated: As of August, 764 cases have been reportedly prosecuted, 2763 cases have not been prosecuted, 2972 cases have resulted in criminal sentences, and 879 cases have resulted in acquittals. Furthermore, regarding the investigation of war criminals, between January and June of this year, 13,983 cases have been sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and 1,262 defendants have been found guilty after review. Xie concluded by mentioning that the American legal scholar Pound's recent visit to China has contributed greatly. Mr. Pound is proficient in English and American law and continental law. He believes that it is very appropriate for China to adopt continental law, but it should be further adapted to national conditions. He also suggested that China's laws are not yet perfect, and the government should invite legal experts to annotate the true meaning of civil and criminal law to avoid divergent interpretations and inconsistent applications. We are currently considering this suggestion. Subsequently, the councilors questioned Xie regarding the case of He Dekui, which was previously reported by Councilor Luo Heng, leading to heated debates. Following this, the following proposals were discussed: (1) A proposal by Ren Chunwu and others requesting the government to quickly provide relief to the disaster-stricken areas of western Yunnan and reduce the amount of grain requisitioned in Yunnan Province. It was resolved to submit this proposal to the government for prompt action. (2) A proposal by Wu Zhaoxu and others stating that the disaster situation in Shanxi is serious, especially for the people of Datong and those from Shangdang who are refugees in Henan and Shaanxi, whose plight is even more tragic, requesting the government to quickly send senior officials with large sums of money and food to provide urgent relief to save the lives of the people. It was resolved to submit this proposal to the government for prompt action. (3) A proposal by Kuiyi and others stating that the living allowance standards for faculty and staff of national colleges and universities should be consistent, and the differentiated adjustment method should be abolished to alleviate the crisis in higher education. It was resolved to submit this proposal to a subcommittee for review. (4) A proposal requesting the government to quickly assist overseas Chinese victims in the Dutch East Indies. It was resolved to submit this proposal to the government for prompt action. (5) A proposal stating that rice shortages are severe in Xiamen and requesting the Ministry of Food to allocate loans to purchase and transport rice to regulate the food supply for the people. It was resolved to submit this proposal to the government for action. (6) A proposal by Xue Mingjian and others requesting the government to instruct the China Tobacco Corporation to improve the method of purchasing dried tobacco leaves. It was resolved to submit this proposal to the government for prompt action. (7) A proposal by Yin Shuxian and others stating that after the adjustment of foreign exchange rates, prices have soared and the financial market has become increasingly chaotic, and requesting the government to quickly devise appropriate measures and not further devalue exchange rates to alleviate the people's difficulties. It was resolved to submit this proposal to a subcommittee for review.

### Standing Committee Member of the Political Consultative Council Questions the Case of He Dekui; Minister Xie's Explanation Sparks Heated Debate

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 27th] In Minister Xie's report to the regular meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Consultative Council, not a word was mentioned about the handling of the case of He Dekui, which was previously reported by Councilor Luo Heng. The councilors expressed dissatisfaction and questioned him one after another. Xie explained that the suspicion of treason lies in the following two points: (1) those who worked under the puppet organization, and (2) those who engaged in acts of collusion with the enemy. He Dekui's position in the Shanghai Municipal Council, an international organization, does not make it a completely puppet organization. As for whether it constitutes collusion with the enemy, it can be further studied. He also reported that the case of He Dekui was notified to the Executive Yuan by the Supreme National Defense Council, and the Executive Yuan notified the Ministry of Judicial Administration. The ministry immediately sent personnel to Shanghai to investigate and submit a report. This report has been forwarded to the Supreme National Defense Council. The Supreme National Defense Council discussed it for a long time at its last meeting, but no conclusion has been reached. Regarding the evidence presented by Councilor Luo Heng, namely the approval of the use of puppet textbooks, Xie stated: This official matter was submitted by his subordinate on June 24, while He signed it on July 27, delaying it for more than 30 days. Although this cannot be said to be sufficient to mitigate the crime, it also cannot be said to constitute collusion with the enemy (Note: At that time, He was the Director of the Education Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the Japanese Okamoto was the Chairman. After the signature was established, all schools switched to using puppet textbooks). After Xie finished explaining, councilors Fan Yusui, Xu Xiaoyan, Yin Shuxian and others expressed dissatisfaction, believing that the government should not delay the handling of the case. Luo Heng then presented his views to refute it, approximately as follows: If the Shanghai Municipal Council cannot be considered a puppet organization, then what kind of institution is a puppet organization? If the Wang Jingwei government, which was controlled by the enemy and puppets, is called a puppet organization, then how can the Shanghai Municipal Council, which was controlled by the enemy and puppets, not be? Therefore, this point should be explained from a legal perspective. Secondly, after the Shanghai Municipal Council was taken over by the enemy, the government instructed the original staff to withdraw, but He did not withdraw, which clearly constitutes treasonous behavior. This matter has not been noticed by the judiciary, nor has it been reported, but it is indeed necessary to draw attention to it. Furthermore, when the government sent personnel to investigate, the case files were suddenly lost, and this should be investigated. He then stated: Whether the Shanghai Municipal Council can be called an international organization should be studied, and it should be studied from a practical perspective, not from a formal perspective. For example, the Shanghai Higher Court once handled the case of Huang Fusen, who worked in the police station. The nature of the police station is the same as that of the Shanghai Municipal Council. In the past, both were international organizations, but Huang Fusen was convicted of collusion with the enemy, while He was not. At this time, Councilor Yin Shuxian stated again that whether or not there was collusion with the enemy is not the point. The promotion of slave education is a fact and is detrimental to the nation and the people. The debate was extremely heated, and many opinions were raised. It was then decided to discuss it at the next meeting. The meeting adjourned at around 1 p.m.

### Hankou's Puppet Army Commander Zou Pingfan Raids Large Quantities of Supplies; Investigation Team Releases Details and Requests Immediate Arrest

[Our Hankou Dispatch of the 26th] The Xiang-E-Gan Area Investigation Team has recently released the case of Zou Pingfan, the puppet army commander, who took advantage of the enemy's surrender and the chaos in Wuhan to plunder supplies on a large scale. The main points are as follows: (1) He commanded his troops to guard all the important enemy warehouses in Wuhan and the warehouses of the enemy's Wuhan Business Association, and used trucks to transport various inventory goods to his private residence in Hanyang for concealment and private ownership. The continuous transportation lasted for ten days. (2) Taking advantage of the takeover, he stole 10,000 dan of salt stored by the enemy at the Xuanmiaoguan Temple outside the West Gate of Hanyang and transported it to the Huanglingji area of Caidian for sale. He also privately transported and sold 15,000 dan of salt stored in the Taikoo Wharf godowns. (3) On August 26 of last year, he ordered his team to transport 200 Type 38 rifles, 2,500 Type 99 rifles, 4,000 Type 38 light machine guns, more than 500 Zhongzheng rifles, and 400 boxes of pistols from the Japanese 112th warehouse (located at the Fourth Wharf) and concealed it without reporting it. (4) On September 5 of last year, Sun Mingdu's troop, the Second Special Agent Battalion of the puppet army, robbed the Japanese warehouse in Wuchang of 1,600 Type 38 rifles, 13 Type 38 heavy machine guns, 8 light machine guns, 50 grenade launchers, more than 1,000 grenades, and more than 70 various pistols. (5) He robbed 3,000 dan of rice from the Japanese 105th warehouse, and robbed more than 500 dan of rice from Yongfeng, Maoshenglu, Hengmao and other rice mills on Minzu Road. (6) He robbed the gold jewelry and clothing of Liu Lifan, the puppet mayor of Wuchang. After investigation by the Japanese Materials Management Committee of the Sixth War Area Headquarters, only a small part was recovered. Finally, the team concluded: Zou Pingfan held an important position in the puppet army under the protection of the enemy and puppets, resisted the National Army, and harmed the people. He was already guilty of heinous crimes. After the enemy army surrendered, the Central Government was magnanimous and allowed him to start anew. However, he did not reflect and continued to do evil under the guise of takeover. The value of his stolen goods and property in Wuhan amounted to hundreds of millions. If such a major criminal is not severely punished, it will be impossible to face the people and maintain order. Therefore, yesterday, based on the facts of the investigation, it has telegraphed the Wuhan Chairman's Headquarters to issue an arrest warrant for Zou Pingfan and bring him to justice. It also requested that all his property in Wuhan be sealed up first.

### "There Is No Place Like Home"; Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia Suffer Economic Discrimination; Chinese Nationals in French-Viet Nam Often Affected by Fights

[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 27th] According to returned overseas Chinese who recently arrived here from Singapore and spoke with reporters about the situation of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, currently, overseas Chinese are not only being treated with hostility by the colonial rulers, but are also suffering from serious economic discrimination. As a result, Chinese communities everywhere feel that "there is no place like home" and are planning to transfer their assets back to China. However, because they are not fully aware of the current situation in China, most are watching and hesitating. Last month, overseas Chinese leaders in Singapore proposed to raise 30 billion yuan to establish the Fujian Economic Construction Company. It is generally believed that if the government can provide practical guarantees of rights and interests, then many times more funds could be raised. Overseas Chinese in Singapore still have some development in the rubber industry, and the economic situation is relatively stable. In Viet Nam, however, the Chinese are often affected by the ongoing struggles between the French and the Vietnamese. The sugar industry is subjected to harsh treatment, and the future is bleak. In the Philippines, due to the promotion of diplomatic relations between China and the Philippines, the situation of overseas Chinese is gradually improving. Currently, overseas Chinese schools there urgently need teachers, and it is hoped that the motherland will send people to go. The returned overseas Chinese also stated that the number of overseas Chinese and their economic strength are the greatest in Fujian and Guangdong. It is by no means difficult to call on them to return home to invest.

Editorial

### Considering the Big Picture, Not Arguing Over Trifles

The peace talks between the government and the Communist Party have shown signs of renewed hope since Chairman Chiang's return to Nanjing the day before yesterday. We, the common people, eagerly hope that this atmosphere will become increasingly strong, and especially pray that it will not end merely as talk. We cherish peace and also deeply believe that the government desires peace; after nearly two months of military engagement, we imagine that today's Communist Party may also be seeking peace. Therefore, now that Chairman Chiang has returned to Nanjing and Marshal Ma has put forward a compromise solution, if both parties seize this good opportunity and do not let it slip away, then the peaceful unification of China, at this final critical juncture, should have the possibility of being realized.

To realize the peaceful unification of China, the most important condition, of course, lies in the sincerity of both the government and the Communist Party. However, sincerity alone is not enough; both parties must have far-sighted vision and broad-mindedness. With great vision, one can consider the big picture; with broad-mindedness, one can avoid arguing over trifles. If both parties can consider the overall situation and not be preoccupied with petty disputes, we believe that as fellow Chinese, as long as they are not willingly subservient to foreign powers, what issues cannot be discussed and must be resolved by force? In the past, perhaps the Communist Party, relying on its rebellious military strength, thought it could compete with the central government, and thus only viewed peace talks as a process of gaining time for attack, without any sincerity. But after the trials of the past two months, the Communist Party should realize that military force is not necessarily reliable, and it is better to turn back and sincerely seek a political solution. In the past, perhaps the government believed that the Communist army occupied strategic locations and blocked transportation, and the government could not allow it to secede in the name of peace talks; but now, the war in northern Jiangsu is expected to end soon, and several important strongholds have gradually been recovered. The areas from which the government originally hoped the Communist army would withdraw have seen their influence weakened, and the government may also feel that there is no need to insist on a counter-offensive. Therefore, if both parties broaden their horizons and expand their minds, reopening peace talks at this time would be the best opportunity, and it is hoped that it will yield results.

The reason why previous peace talks were stalled was the dispute over whether to convene a five-person group or a three-person group first; in other words, it was the dispute over whether to discuss the reorganization of the National Government first or to discuss a military ceasefire first. In fact, ceasefire orders have been issued repeatedly, and opinions on the reorganization of the National Government have been exchanged more than once, making the order of discussion meaningless. Now, the two mediators, Ma and Ssu, have suggested that the three-person group and the five-person group be convened simultaneously, and that military and political planning be considered together. This is deeply in line with the principle of moderation, and now we are only waiting for a response from the Communist Party representative, Zhou Enlai, as to whether he will return to Nanjing. There used to be a joke about the great scientist Newton, who had a big cat and a small cat at home, so he made a big hole and a small hole in the wall for them to pass through. In fact, with a big hole, couldn't the small cat also enter and exit freely? Today, arguing over a five-person group versus a three-person group for the sake of peace talks is no less ridiculous. We, the common people, have suffered enough and are tired of war. We have no mood to listen to such meaningless disputes. We sincerely ask both parties to consider the big picture and not argue over such trifles.

For the sake of the government, we want to advise the central figures to embody Heaven's virtue of cherishing life and the Chairman's heart of loving the people. The counter-offensive against the Communist army should be stopped when appropriate. As long as the Communist Party expresses its willingness to participate in the reorganized government and sincerely participate in the National Assembly for constitutional drafting, then the stability of the overall situation can be assured, and the happiness of the Chinese people can be expected. Everything else can be discussed calmly, and there is no need to continue mobilizing troops. For the sake of the Communist Party, we must also advise their leaders not to regard themselves as grassroots heroes in Chinese history, holding onto the outdated idea of "if you succeed, you are a king; if you fail, you are a bandit." They should broaden their horizons, learn from the style of opposition parties in democratic and advanced countries around the world, put down their guns, speak up, jump out of the battlefield, and enter the political arena. Then, even if they withdraw from a few cities and towns on the battlefield today, who knows if they will occupy more seats in the parliament in the future? Moreover, to be honest, the Communist Party should also see clearly that at present—at least in these few years—the Soviet Union is not necessarily determined to go to war with the United States, so why should they volunteer to take an anti-American stance on the Chinese battlefield first? The construction and revival of China after the war depend on the assistance of all allied nations. If we are peaceful and united internally, then any external help, whether capital or technology, can be supplied continuously, and China's future is promising. If the Communist Party does not want to be a sinner of the nation, it should not obstruct China's construction by creating war. Therefore, for the sake of the people and for the sake of both parties, we cannot help but earnestly advise both the government and the Communist Party to consider the big picture, not argue over trifles, and complete the historical task of peaceful unification.

Whoever can take the lead in showing that they will not argue over trifles, whoever can thoroughly show that they will consider the big picture, will win the support of the people, and will win the country.

### Someone is Pulling Strings Behind the Greek Civil War, Britain and the United States Decide to Adopt a Firm Stance, British Troops Will Not Withdraw to Maintain Order and Tranquility

[United Press International, Washington, 26th] According to high-level sources today: The U.S. government is planning to adopt a "hard-line" policy to deal with the suspected activities of the Soviet Union in the Greek situation, and the first step may be to provide further financial and economic assistance to Greece. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes has discussed this situation with British Foreign Secretary Bevin in Paris, and both sides have apparently agreed that the British and American governments should be absolutely firm in their position on Greece, as they are on Iran and other areas of conflicting interests. According to behind-the-scenes indications, the Communist forces in northern Greece who are stubbornly resisting the government army are receiving arms supplies from Yugoslavia and Albania. A diplomat familiar with the overall situation said that this "creeping war" in northern Greece has caused great concern in Washington, because although the direct combatants are small countries, behind them is the power struggle between major countries, which is where the danger lies. Britain and the United States believe that only by jointly adopting a "tough" stance to assist the Greek government can this conflict be controlled, otherwise the Soviet Union may expand its influence southward through Greece and gain control of the eastern Mediterranean.

[United Press, London, 26th] The government today stated that if the Greek army cannot suppress the Macedonian Communist rebellion, British troops may intervene in the Greek civil war. Reports that the British commander has been ordered not to participate in the Greek civil war have been denied by the Foreign Office, which emphasized that the purpose of the British troops' stay in Greece is to stabilize the government's position and maintain peace and order.

[United Press International, Thessaloniki, 26th] Greek troops are conducting military operations in the north. According to Greek officials, a group of rioters attacked a Greek outpost from eastern Albania through the Yugoslav border. The attackers used automatic weapons and hand grenades, but were driven back. At the same time, it is reported that the British command is reorganizing the 30,000 troops stationed there, and it is rumored that one of the two British divisions will be withdrawn from Greece. According to a London dispatch, a British Foreign Office spokesman said that the war between the government army and the left-wing rebels in northern Greece is most intense south of the Yugoslav and Albanian borders, and is expanding westward to the area south of the Bulgarian border. The British government has no intention of withdrawing its troops from Greece immediately.

Potentially Lead to Serious Consequences

[Reuters, London, 26th] London observers believe that if the civil war expands to the entire country and the British troops have not yet withdrawn, the latter will inevitably be involved. Supporters of the Greek government believe that the left-wing guerrillas, with the help of southern Albania and even Bulgaria, may exceed the strength of the government army, eventually forcing the British army to intervene. Currently, the support of Greece's northern neighbors for the left-wing guerrillas is becoming increasingly obvious and active, and may eventually overwhelm the government army. The possible consequences are three: (1) British troops withdraw immediately, regardless of the fate of the Greek army; (2) Large-scale but covert foreign intervention, creating a situation similar to the Spanish Civil War; (3) British and Slavic countries aid the war, openly acknowledging it. The last of these three scenarios is the most dangerous and could ignite a widespread war.

Turkey Consolidates Border Defenses

[United Press International, Athens, 26th] According to sources in Istanbul, Turkey is taking a calm attitude towards the so-called "small-scale civil war" in northern Greece and will not take any action. Turkey has consolidated its defenses in Thrace Province, north of the Dardanelles Strait and adjacent to the Greek border. Some people doubt whether the deterioration of the Greek situation is as serious as reported, but hundreds of Turks living in Thrace Province are fleeing back to their country to avoid persecution by the Greek Communists. According to Turkish newspapers, 800 people fled back to their country three days ago, and those who could not escape are said to be being "slaughtered."

### Greek King Returns to Power, Communist Party Proposes Conditions for Joining Government

The police have announced that no one will be allowed to carry weapons at that time for security reasons. People are not allowed to move freely along the King's procession route, and residents are not allowed to watch from the rooftops or balconies within 100 yards.

[This Newspaper] London, 27th Broadcast: As King George II of Greece departed London to return to his country, the Greek Communist Party today proposed six conditions for ending the civil war and joining a coalition government: (1) Expanding the cabinet to include all parties and factions; (2) Requiring Britain to withdraw all troops; (3) Amnesty for all political prisoners and officers exiled to the Aegean islands; (4) Reorganizing the army to include people of all views; (5) Revising the electoral rolls for the constitutional assembly; (6) Stipulating a foreign policy of equal friendship with all allies. If these conditions are not accepted, they will intensify their resistance.

### General Assembly of Peace Conference Passes Resolution to Expedite Work, Byrnes Expresses Optimism About Future of Peace Conference

[United Press, Paris, 26th] The Peace Conference held a plenary meeting tonight, and after a heated debate between Chairman Byrnes and the representatives of Yugoslavia, Ukraine, and the Soviet Union on the rules of procedure, unanimously passed a four-power resolution to expedite the work of the Peace Conference and adjourn on October 15. The Yugoslav representative asked the General Assembly to pay attention to Greece's request for Albania to cede the Northern Epirus region, and the Greek representative surprisingly expressed his willingness to withdraw this request on the spot.

[This Newspaper] Paris, 27th Broadcast: General Mossot, Chairman of the Military Committee, proposed that the review of the various clauses be completed as early as September 28, before the deadline stipulated by the General Assembly. However, whether the clauses for Hungary and Finland can be completed on time is still a question, so the committee decided to hold two meetings a day. Soviet representative Novikov advocated stopping unproductive work and shortening the report submitted to the Italian Political and Territorial Committee.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 26th] Byrnes stated at a press conference that he was very satisfied with President Truman's recent statement that the US foreign policy remains unchanged. Since the opening of the Peace Conference two months ago, small countries have had ample opportunities to speak, and he feels optimistic about the future of the Peace Conference. According to Bei, it is the first time to express public optimism

[United Press International, Long Island, New York, 26th] He Yingqin, the Chinese representative to the United Nations Military Staff Committee, met with reporters at his residence here today and stated that after 20 years of military life, he has experienced the tragedy of war. The general hope for world peace must be based on mutual trust among all countries. Establishing a world army under the control of the United Nations that can reach the most remote areas of the world in three or four days is the ideal way to maintain world peace. He believes that the US plan to conduct inspections in various countries is the only way to stop the accelerated approach to war. He also stated that Chinese intelligence proved that Japan had considered a truce in June 1945 due to heavy ship losses. He learned after the war that Japan was researching a "death ray" that could be fatal within one kilometer, but it had been destroyed before the surrender.

King George II of Greece, who was in exile in London during the war, has returned to power today due to the support of the vast majority of the people in the recent referendum. Since Greece was invaded by German troops in April 1941, resulting in its fall, it has been more than five and a half years, and it has now restored its pre-war political order, which is naturally a great joy. But this matter, especially today, when Britain and the Soviet Union are competing for hegemony in the Balkans, has an even deeper meaning.

Greece, a country with a glorious history of ancient politics and culture, can be said to have gone through many vicissitudes in the past hundred years. Since the division of the Roman Empire in the fifth century, Greece was annexed by Turkey in 1473. It was not until the outbreak of the revolution for independence in 1821 that it finally succeeded after eight years of bloody struggle, and separated from Turkey to become independent. But as soon as the rule of Turkey came to an end, the power of Russia stepped in. In 1828, when the independence movement had not yet fully succeeded, Count John Capodistrias, who had served as Foreign Minister to the Russian Emperor Alexander, was elected President of the Greek Republic. However, due to his excessive pro-Russian policy and the government's autocratic dictatorship, the Greek people were greatly dissatisfied, and the new president was eventually assassinated. In 1830, it was announced that the political system would be changed to a monarchy, and Prince Otto of Bavaria was elected as the first King of Greece. At this time, Greece was under the protection of Britain, France, and Russia, and the leaders of the government each formed pro-British, pro-French, and pro-Russian groups, opposing each other. In 1862, Otto was driven out of the country, and with the support of Britain, Prince Alfred was elected to succeed the throne. Since then, Britain's power in Greece has far surpassed that of Russia.

In 1923, the current King George II ascended the throne. In March of the following year, a revolution broke out in the country, establishing a republic, and the King fled the country. In 1935, as a result of a referendum, it was agreed to restore the monarchy, and George II returned to the country. At the beginning of this World War, Greece originally declared neutrality, but due to the pro-British attitude of its government, it had long been resented by Germany and Italy. In 1940, Italy issued an ultimatum to Greece, demanding that Italian troops occupy several strategic locations in Greece. The Greek government replied and refused, and Italian troops invaded from the Albanian border. German troops also sent troops to assist. Although Greece had the assistance of British troops, it continued to retreat. In April 1941, the capital Athens fell, and both the British and Greek governments retreated to Crete. German troops then landed paratroopers on Crete. The island had already been largely under the influence of the Soviet Union, so the status of Greece became even more important to Britain. This small piece of land, with an area of only 50,147 square miles, currently occupies an extremely important strategic position in the Mediterranean. Its northwestern neighbor Albania, its northern neighbor Yugoslavia, and its northeastern neighbor Bulgaria have all become areas of Soviet influence. It is bordered by the Aegean Sea to the east and faces Turkey across the sea, close to the Adriatic Sea to the west, and facing the vast Mediterranean Sea to the south. If the Soviet Union's power invades this area again, Britain's hegemony in the Mediterranean will be completely shaken.

The recent referendum decided whether to support the restoration of the King or to form another republican government. As a result, among the 1,779,924 votes, 1,135,675 voted in favor of restoring the King, and only 521,540 voted against it, with the rest being invalid votes. This matter was certainly a great success for Britain, but on the other hand, it also symbolizes a major setback for the Soviet Union's southward expansion. Before the vote, the Soviet Union launched a large-scale diplomatic offensive, first accusing the British troops' stay in Greece of endangering peace, and then inciting Ukraine to file a complaint against Greece in the recent United Nations Security Council. This was originally intended by the Soviet Union as a kind of diplomatic pressure, and to stir up the Greek people's suspicion of Britain, but unexpectedly, the result turned out to be counterproductive, causing the resentment of most of the Greek people. The reason why the pro-monarchy faction was able to achieve such an unexpected victory in this referendum lies in this. Recently, three events have occurred in the Balkans and the Middle East, all symbolizing the decline of Soviet power: (1) In Turkey, with the support of Britain and the United States, Turkey strongly rejected the Soviet Union's request to jointly manage the Dardanelles Strait. (2) In Yugoslavia, regarding the incident in which the southern country shot down two US transport planes, due to the strong pressure from the United States and the failure of the Soviet Union to provide southern countries with support in practice, Yugoslavia had no choice but to completely succumb. (3) In Greece, the result of this vote has dealt a serious blow to the Soviet Union. Therefore, this Greek referendum is not just a question of whether a king can return, but represents the balance of power between Britain and the Soviet Union, the Western bloc and the Soviet bloc, in the Balkan Peninsula.

Currently, the Greek Communist army has rebelled, and a civil war may break out. If the Greek government is unable to contain it, the British troops stationed in Greece will intervene to help quell the internal unrest. Whether this will lead to a conflict between the two major powers behind the scenes is a matter of great concern in this era of volatile international situations, where everyone is on edge.

### Petition Group of City Council Decides to Go to the Capital the Day After Tomorrow. Resolution Made in Yesterday's Conversation Meeting. Three More Guiding Principles Proposed: Establish Economic Policies, Establish an Economic Revival Association in Shanghai, and Allocate Special Funds for the Revival of Shanghai.

[Report from Our Newspaper] The City Council's eleven councilors organized a petition group to advise the government to improve financial policies as soon as possible. Yesterday at 3 p.m., a conversation meeting was held at the Fuming City Council. Except for Councilor Wang Xianqing, who was in Hangzhou, Deputy Speaker Xu Jiqing, Councilors Xu Guomao, Jin Runxiang, Luo Qinghua, Wang Yansong, Tao Baichuan, Yang Fusheng, Xi Yushu, Yu Zuoting, and Liu Jingji, totaling ten people, attended. Speaker Pan Gongzhan also attended. During the meeting, Speaker Pan first reported two points of view from the outside world regarding this petition group: (1) Some people believe that the previous petition by the business community to the capital did not yield any results, and they are deeply afraid that this petition by the councilors will repeat the same mistakes and still yield no results. (2) However, some people still expressed that this matter is of great importance, and regardless of the success or failure of the petition, the mission is still necessary, at least to enable the government to understand the opinions of the citizens of Shanghai and also to fulfill the wishes of the people of the country. Therefore, they have high hopes for the petition group. Speaker Pan continued, stating that this petition is by no means a mass movement but a rational statement. Therefore, he hoped that the delegation would conduct preliminary research and separate resolutions on the most important and secondary matters before departure, and exchange opinions to prepare.

Subsequently, Deputy Speaker Xu proposed, and the councilors agreed, to depart for the capital separately next Monday (the 30th). On October 1st, at 9 a.m., they will meet at the Zhejiang Industrial Bank in Nanjing and then go to the Executive Yuan to petition. On the morning of October 2nd, they will go to the Supreme National Defense Council to petition. They will also submit written petitions and telegrams to the Chairman of the National Government, the Central Standing Committee of the Central Party Headquarters, the President of the Executive Yuan, the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Economic Affairs, the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, the Minister of Transportation, and the Supreme National Defense Council. In addition, special telegrams will be sent to Wu Dingchang, Chief Secretary of the National Government, and Yu Jishi, Chief of Staff, requesting them to present the reports and arrange meeting times to meet with the Chairman, President Song, and the ministers of various departments. The representatives are scheduled to return to Shanghai on October 2nd. The travel expenses to the capital will be borne by the representatives themselves. After the petition group returns to Shanghai, a press conference will be held.

The conversation meeting resolved to propose three more guiding principles to be presented to the highest authorities: (1) Establish economic policies. The government's economic policies during the war were indeed flawed, and it is even more wrong to apply the previous policies after the war. Currently, the government's economic measures are inconsistent, with "saying" one thing and "doing" another. If this continues, the economic future will be unimaginable. To save the industrial and commercial crisis, the government must act consistently, strictly adhere to the teachings of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and implement the economic policies of the Three Principles of the People. (2) In terms of organization: The government should establish an Economic Revival Committee in Shanghai. Since the victory of this war, the central government has established many agencies in Shanghai to receive a large amount of materials. However, no organization has been established to provide relief and revive Shanghai's economy. Therefore, it is proposed to petition the central government to consider Shanghai and establish a formal organization, requesting President Song to personally serve as the chairman, with the mayor and the speaker of the City Council as vice-chairmen, and inviting major industrial, commercial, and financial institutions in the city to participate jointly. At the very least, this can enable the government and the people to understand each other's difficulties. (3) Request the central government to allocate 50% of the funds from the Enemy Property Administration for the materials received as special funds for the revival of Shanghai.

Furthermore, councilors expressed their opinions, believing that this organization should be sustainable and hoping that the government would value public opinion and do its best to assist in achieving its goals. The petitions submitted by the petition group to the relevant government agencies are as follows:

### Proposed Telegram

The victory of the Anti-Japanese War has been over a year. Because the national economic policies have not fully met the people's expectations, and financial measures have failed to coordinate with the reconstruction plan, prices have risen daily, the value of currency has fallen, production has been trapped in a dead end, the financial situation has become increasingly unbalanced, the trade deficit has increased daily, and economic collapse is imminent. The handling of enemy and puppet properties has been mishandled, and corruption has been rampant, causing public resentment to boil over. This city has always been the economic and financial center of the country and deeply understands the details and feels the pain firsthand. Since the opening of the first session of the first congress of this council, the city's Chamber of Commerce, the Banking and Money Trade Association, the China Tea Association, and councilors Wang Zhengting, Luo Qinghua, Liu Jingji, Lao Jingxiu, and Mei Huaishu have addressed the current malpractices and proposed concrete solutions. After careful review by this council, the congress solemnly resolved the case. Now, we specifically extract its outline and list it on the left:

Regarding the adjustment of banking business:

(1) In order to improve the efficiency of national banks, the government should strengthen the specialization of banks. The central bank must fulfill its function as a "bank of banks" and handle rediscounting and re-mortgaging so that the banking industry is happy to accept production loans. At the same time, reduce the deposit reserve ratio, confirm the performance of the reserve, and actively utilize it. (2) Commercial banks have close relationships with industry and commerce. The government should relax the management methods for commercial banks and effectively support them to indirectly support industry and commerce.

Regarding the adjustment of agricultural, industrial, and commercial funds:

(1) All factories lack production funds. Long-term, low-interest, and planned industrial loans should be conducted to increase production and guarantee repayment. (2) For factory loans, state-owned specialized banks should investigate the actual needs of industrial production of each factory and provide low-interest loans. The collateral should not be limited to raw materials and finished products. All factory buildings, machinery, and real estate should be allowed to be provided as collateral. The acceptance of remittances and the sales financing of goods should be actively undertaken to facilitate the flow of goods. (3) In rural areas, due to the years of burning by soldiers, the purchase of seeds, plows, and agricultural tools, the management of water conservancy, and the prevention of disasters all require borrowing a large amount of funds. Agricultural loans should continue to be actively conducted. As for the production and processing loans for agricultural export products such as raw silk, tung oil, and tea, they should not be suspended. With the autumn harvest in sight, low grain prices are passed on to farmers. To protect the production interests of farmers, the China Farmers Bank is expected to quickly launch grain loans and cotton loans. (4) All loans should be provided at the lowest possible interest rate, and loan procedures should be simplified. (5) To prevent excessive issuance of currency, in-kind loans can be provided separately. The government should provide necessary materials, such as production raw materials, fuels, and machinery equipment, to the factories that actually need them to develop co-production. (6) Organize an industrial revival investment company with a capital of 2 billion US dollars, of which one-quarter is raised by the private sector. All private funds overseas should be allowed to be invested first. The remaining three-quarters are raised from overseas Chinese and foreigners. The government stipulates guaranteed principal and interest to promote it.

Regarding the development of international trade:

(1) Implement an import and export linkage system (either linked in terms of amount or linked according to its type, such as importers of cotton, responsible for exporting yarn within a certain period), and supplement it with export subsidies or high-priced purchases. The government should purchase certain materials related to barter and debt repayment at high prices to maintain agriculture. (3) Implement a barter system. For example, at the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, the government used tea to barter with the Soviet Union and airlifted it to the United States to support sales in North Africa, which achieved considerable results. This method is most suitable for countries that control international trade, such as the Soviet Union, and is also an urgent requirement for tea merchants. (3) Use economic diplomacy to expand the market. Taking Chinese tea as an example, some countries' tariffs have unfavorable regulations on Chinese tea. For example, the United Kingdom limits this year's Chinese tea imports to 2.5 million pounds, only 20% of the amount of Chinese tea exported to the UK in 1937. The United States restricts prices for Chinese tea due to price restrictions. For example, Casablanca, the center of the North African green tea market, which is the largest market for Chinese silk and tea, has not yet established a consulate. Tea merchants are greatly hindered in their trade due to lack of guidance and contact. It is proposed to increase the number of consulates as soon as possible to protect and promote trade. (4) Exempt goods for export from commodity tax to reduce costs.

Regarding enlivening local land finance:

(1) For land finance, the government should quickly formulate measures and actively implement them to develop agricultural finance. (2) The draft Banking Law limits the maximum period for a bank to re-sell real estate after it has been taken over to only one year, which is too short and should be amended. (3) Shanghai's industrial and commercial sectors often use real estate as an important guarantee for financing from the banking industry. However, in recent years, banks such as the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank do not use real estate as collateral for financing to the industrial and commercial sectors. Commercial banks and firms therefore dare not accept it. This is the biggest obstacle to enlivening land finance and should be improved by the government as soon as possible.

Regarding compensating for the losses of the city's Anti-Japanese War:

(1) All losses suffered by resuming factories should be compensated by the government as soon as possible, and they should be allowed to preferentially accept confiscated enemy and puppet factories and raw materials under preferential conditions to complete industrial recovery. (2) The Enemy and Puppet Property Administration handles materials, factories, and houses in the Shanghai area, and the total value of the proceeds from the auction can reach more than one trillion yuan. They are all the fat and blood that the enemy and puppets plundered from the citizens of Shanghai and should be returned to the city to restore vitality. According to the meaning of the central and local equalization of rights, half should be allocated to the city for construction, culture, and public welfare.

Regarding solving the city's fuel panic:

This city has many factories and a large population, and the demand for fuel is very large. Since the victory, coal mines in coal-producing areas have been unable to provide a steady supply due to traffic obstructions. The Central Fuel Management Committee has added control over the purchase and sale of coal. As a result, the famine for coal has become increasingly serious, and the price of coal has risen increasingly. If this continues, it will not only affect production but also hinder the people's livelihood. The control should be lifted quickly to encourage citizens to freely purchase, sell, and adjust supply and demand to relieve the people's difficulties. In summary, these are the most pressing problems in the city today. The city's Chamber of Commerce, after the ninth congress in August, summarized the important resolutions on economic construction, created an outline, and sent personnel to the capital to pay their respects to the Central Standing Committee, the National Government, the Supreme National Defense Conference, the Executive and Legislative Yuans, and the Ministries of Finance and Economy to petition. However, after more than a month, there has been no effective approval. After the recent adjustment of exchange rates by the central government, exports have not improved due to production costs being higher than foreign market prices, and domestic prices have risen first. Following this, the Four Banks Joint Office issued a statement denying eight types of production loans and national banks stopping industrial loans, which is another mistake on top of a mistake, only showing the empty name of "supporting production and rewarding exports" and making the production sector even more deeply in a state of irretrievability. This council's responsibility is to convey the people's grievances. Observing the more than 3.5 million citizens in deep water and fire, eagerly hoping, we cannot remain silent any longer. In addition to sending the original six resolutions by telegram, we have specially appointed Deputy Speaker Xu Jiguang, Councilors Xi Yushu, Wang Yansong, Ling Runxiang, Liu Jingji, Luo Qinghua, Tao Baichuan, Yu Zuoting, Wang Xianqing, Xu Guomao, and Yang Fusheng, eleven people as representatives, to state the facts. We hope that you will consider the city's crisis, which the whole country shares, accept the suggestions, and implement them quickly one by one. This is for the public convenience. Pan Gongzhan, Speaker of the First City Council of Shanghai. Xu Jiqing, Deputy Speaker, bows.

### Two Monks from Jing'an Temple Detained After Interrogation. The Most Prominent Charge Against Them Is Implementing Slave Education. De Wu and Mi Jia Unexpectedly Entered Prison Submissively.

[Report from Our Newspaper] Abbot De Wu and Supervisor Mi Jia of Jing'an Temple in this city were accused of communicating with the enemy and collaborating with the enemy. Yesterday morning at 11 a.m., the High Prosecutor's Office held a third court session to investigate. After investigation, it was considered that the suspicion was serious, and Prosecutor Chang Ting ordered their detention. They were sent to the Zhongzi Prison in Shanghai Prison at 12:30 p.m. Both of them were wearing black robes. Because they did not expect to be detained beforehand, they were empty-handed and did not bring anything with them. They recited Amitabha and sadly entered prison.

The case was jointly accused by Xie Xiqing, Cai Jianquan, Lu Zhonghou, Zhou Yinquan, and witnesses Chen Zhixin, Yao Shaoxiu, and Xu Honghan, businessmen in this city. Three major charges were listed, one of the most prominent being the establishment of the Tongpeng Japanese Language School to implement slave education. After accepting the case, the High Prosecutor's Office summoned and investigated twice, and the defendants were allowed to be released on bail. The accusers believed that the wanted criminals were still at large, so on the 23rd of this month, they requested the City Council to uphold justice, presented the defendants' documents of collaboration with the enemy, and requested a public decision. After the congress decided, it agreed to forward the matter to the court. Yesterday afternoon, during the third investigation by the High Prosecutor's Office, the defendants were suddenly detained.

Two Grandfather and Grandson Appeal for Injustice

Multiple Cases Investigated on the Same Day: (1) Lu Jie, 37 years old, from Xuzhou, was a confidant of Lu Ying and served as the Deputy Director of the puppet Chuansha Police Bureau.

### Implementing the Resolution of the City Council, the Municipal Government Reduces Redundant Personnel. Mayor Wu Proposed It in Yesterday's Municipal Meeting.

[Report from Our Newspaper] At the 48th municipal meeting yesterday morning, Mayor Wu verbally proposed to implement the principles decided by the City Council, intending to reduce redundant personnel to save municipal administrative expenses. He immediately instructed that the standard for layoffs should be 15% in principle, and the affiliated bureaus and offices should consider and implement it themselves. At that time, Mayor Wu left early in a hurry due to other important official business, so the detailed methods and specific steps were not decided. However, it was decided that those whose actual number of personnel did not exceed the central government's establishment number could be handled at their discretion.

[Another Report] After the Executive Yuan's instruction on the "Methods of Punishing Those Who Held Puppet Positions but Were Not Convicted Under the Traitor Law" arrived at the municipal government, the mayor ordered all affiliated bureaus and offices to conduct strict investigations and submit the list of such personnel to the Personnel Office of the municipal government.

### Forced Poor Son-in-Law to Death

Stealing Glass Was Severely Beaten, Tried to Escape, Was Chased, Jumped into River and Drowned

[Report from Our Newspaper] Qian Jinyuan, 21 years old, from Qianjiatang Village, Jiangwan, married Fengyuan (21 years old), the daughter of Wang Fuquan, the owner of a tobacco paper shop in Jiangwan Town, as his wife through a matchmaker several years ago. They had a son. The Huang family was well-off, while Qian Jinyuan was very poor. Therefore, he moved to his wife's family with his wife Fengyuan. He usually helped with chores, which led to contempt from the Huang family, and the relationship between the young couple became increasingly cold, and quarrels occurred from time to time. On the afternoon of the 24th of this month, Qian Jinyuan stole two pieces of glass from his father-in-law's flower shed and was caught by Huang Quanxing, the cousin of his brother-in-law Huang Quanxing. He was taken back to the Huang residence. His father-in-law Fuquan, without asking the reason, grabbed a tree stick and beat Qian severely, causing injuries. He also used ropes to tie him up and hang him upside down on a tree. Jinyuan cried for help, struggled hard, the rope broke and he fell to the ground, and he got up and tried to escape. Huang and his ten nephews chased after him. When he chased him to a small river, Qian was anxious and jumped into the river to swim to the other side. The three members of the Huang family still detoured and chased him relentlessly. Unexpectedly, Qian escaped for about half a mile and encountered a large river several feet deep. Qian was forced to chase and had to ignore everything. He jumped into the water and tried to swim across. In the end, he was tragically drowned due to the wide river surface. Not long after, Jinyuan's mother (59 years old) heard the news and reported it to the Jiangwan Branch Bureau. The branch director Chen Dagong sent police to investigate, and the body was fished out and reported to the court for an autopsy. The murderers Huang Fuquan and others have fled in fear of crime, and the police station is currently tracking them down.

### Shanghai-Hangzhou Group of Investigation Team Discusses Handling Matters in a Temporary Conversation Meeting. Makes Final Decision on the Municipal Government's Corruption Case.

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai-Hangzhou Group of the Investigation Team for the Receipt and Handling of Enemy and Puppet Properties in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Regions held a temporary conversation meeting at the Jiangsu Supervisory Envoy's Office yesterday morning at 10:00 a.m. Group Leader Zhang Zhiben, Commissioners Cheng Zhonghang, Fan Zhengbo, Wu Wangji, Zhang Qingzhen, Zhao Junhao, Ma Junshuo, He Yuanming, Wang Jian'e, and others attended, discussing the conclusion of the group's work and the handling of important cases. It lasted for more than an hour.

According to sources, in yesterday's meeting, the attendees thoroughly studied the municipal government's 4 billion corruption case, which has attracted much attention, from the perspectives of administrative punishment and legal viewpoints, and made a final decision. The municipal government's unauthorized disposal of received materials was clearly illegal, without any doubt. However, the case will not be sent to court.

### The Li Songling Case Has All Documents Collected and Officially Transferred to the High Prosecutor's Office

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai-Hangzhou Group of the Receiving Work Investigation Team previously received a secret report: Li Songling colluded with the enemy and suddenly became rich, buying a large number of properties. After being seized, they were returned, which was suspicious. We pray that the case will be thoroughly investigated and dealt with. We have learned that the group has transferred the documents to the handling bureau for review, believing that whether Li Songling is a traitor should be clarified by the judicial authorities. Whether the seizure was carried out by someone who was corrupt and whether the handling bureau approved the return should also be investigated. Yesterday, all the documents were collected and officially transferred to the Shanghai Higher People's Procuratorate for investigation.

According to investigation, Li Songling was originally a dock worker. After the city fell, he colluded with Japanese ruffians to steal coal from Pudong. Later, he cooperated with the enemy, controlled land and water transportation, and served as a compradore for Mitsubishi Corporation of Japan. He accumulated concubines, built Chinese mansions, and entertained Japanese for gambling and comfort. Li's properties include Maoling Village on Qiqi Road, Maoling New Village on Yaozhu Road, Maoling Villa on Fulvli Road, and Tianshicheng Maoji Silver Building and Anhua Bank stocks on Nanjing Road and Sanma Road. It is heard that Li Songling has transferred his property and fled to Hong Kong.

### Receiving the Zhanghua Factory – Concealing Materials Case – Requesting Original Inventory List from the Ministry of Economic Affairs

[Our Dispatch] Regarding the receipt of the Zhanghua Woolen Mill, and allegations of corrupt conduct, the Investigation Team has conducted a detailed investigation since receiving the confidential report. It is understood that: "Zhanghua" was a partnership operated by Liu Hongsheng and others, forcibly occupied by the enemy. After the victory, the Ministry of Economic Affairs dispatched Li Zhizhan to be responsible for the takeover, and later dispatched Liu Hongsheng to jointly participate in the takeover. After the enemy occupied Zhanghua, the equipment was greatly expanded, and a great deal of raw materials were stored. Now Zhanghua should be returned to the original shareholders at their request. The parts expanded by the enemy will be nationalized, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs will sell them to Zhanghua at a price. It is said that the equipment and materials of the expanded part by the enemy have been concealed. However, regarding this point, no clues have been found in the files of the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau. The Investigation Team is now requesting the original inventory list from the Ministry of Economic Affairs. As for the allegation in the confidential report that Zhang Zi Kuo accepted a bribe of one hundred gold bars, the person in charge of the Investigation Team believes that there is no basis for this.

### Dah Tong Bank Comprador and Others – Accused of Stealing and Occupying Cemetery Land

Wang Detang requests compensation of 20 million yuan for coffin relocation and reburial expenses. The District Court held a trial yesterday and advised the two parties to attempt reconciliation out of court, scheduling a retrial for October 4.

### After the Hurricane's Forewing Passed – Shanghai Became a City of Water – Sewage Swirling, Knee-Deep – Public Works Bureau Says Improvements Can Be Made Next Year

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] The hurricane's forewing swept across this city the day before yesterday. The hurricane has passed, but it has left Shanghai with a vast expanse of water. Linsen Road, Zhongzheng Road, Nanjing Road, Daxi Road, Huashan Road, Robison Road... Almost the entire city of Shanghai, wherever it is slightly low-lying, has become a "Venice of China."

On Nanjing Road, pedestrians at most find the water inconvenient, at most feel that they are being fleeced a few more times by rickshaw pullers. On Linsen Road, the rippling water may even add a lot of poetic charm to this neat and quiet street. However, in the densely populated areas, in the areas where workers and the poor, the so-called lower classes, are concentrated, the water appears so ugly, so cursed.

In the center of Changshou Road (Robison Road), around the large chiming clock, the water is knee-deep. Passing by tram number 16 or 24, a stench reaches the nostrils from afar. People walk barefoot, rolling up their trouser legs, through the stinking water mixed with all kinds of filth. The low, dark shops and houses on both sides of the road, with water submerging the black mud inside, or the dilapidated floors, appear so damp, so damp that it feels like mold is growing in one's heart. However, the people living in those houses continue to live their lives, staring blankly at the water outside the door and smiling foolishly. And many ragged, thin children, the water has brought them great joy. They jump, chase, and play in the water. When the tram passes, a wave is stirred up, and they use their little hands to splash water, laughing so happily. The dirty and foul water pool is as great and beautiful as the ocean in their little hearts. Is the Chinese people's optimism, acceptance of fate, patience, and peace cultivated from such a young age?

The cause of the water accumulation is said to be that the tide gates were closed, and the rainwater could not be discharged in time. Along Suzhou Road to Zhongzheng Road, 164 tide gates have been built, and another 30 are under construction in the former French Concession area. The most important one, Jijiabang, will be completed next month. There is also a water pump that can pump 60,000 gallons of water per hour, which will start working at the end of this year and the beginning of spring. The Public Works Bureau has issued a check, saying that by that time, the areas around Risheng Building, Yuyuan Road, and Haining Road in the former British Concession, and the area near the Lyceum Theatre in the former French Concession, will no longer have the phenomenon of backflow from the ditches. This is great news, worth reporting to the citizens of Shanghai. But, I can't help but think of the stinking big chiming clock area, and the many, many poor areas that are not noticed, will they also no longer be filled with stench at that time?

### Rickshaws to be Banned – To be Phased out in Three Years – Lottery to be Drawn Starting in November

Regarding the ban on rickshaws in this city, Chairman Chiang ordered the Executive Yuan to instruct the Shanghai Municipal Government to ban them within a time limit and to comply with the instructions. If they still do not comply by winter, they will be treated as disobeying orders. After receiving the order, the Municipal Government immediately instructed the Public Utilities Bureau to work with the Police Bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau to draft a plan for review. The Public Utilities Bureau, in compliance with the order, consulted with the Police and Social Affairs Bureaus and decided: (1) The Public Utilities Bureau will use a lottery method to phase out the rickshaws completely in three years. In the first year, 10% will be phased out first, totaling 2,065 operating rickshaws and 630 private rickshaws. The percentage to be phased out in the second year will be determined based on the results. (2) The Social Affairs Bureau will draft detailed measures for the relief of rickshaw pullers, and will also draft implementation measures for managing and banning rickshaws and operating manufacturing sites for rickshaw bodies and parts, to be jointly submitted to the Municipal Government for review by the three bureaus. Subsequently, the Chamber of Commerce sent a letter stating that the majority of rickshaw pullers are from northern Jiangsu, have no homes to return to, and the city's industry and commerce are becoming increasingly depressed, making it difficult to accommodate them. It requested a delay in implementation. The Public Utilities Bureau submitted this to the Municipal Government, which telegraphed the Executive Yuan for approval to accommodate the situation and implement the ban starting next year. Now, because it seems difficult to delay the case any further, the Public Utilities Bureau has drafted and presented implementation steps based on the previous plan jointly submitted by the three bureaus: (1) Starting from October 1, investigate and register rickshaw pullers and rickshaws, as well as parts manufacturing factories, with a target of completing this within one month. (2) Hold a lottery on November 1 to determine the rickshaw numbers to be phased out, using 10% of the total number as the standard, and requiring the licenses to be returned before the end of the year. (3) Starting in October, prepare in advance for small-sum loans to rickshaw pullers who are selected in the lottery, phased out, and return their licenses, according to the Social Affairs Bureau's proposed small-sum loan relief measures, starting in November. (4) The Social Affairs Bureau will expedite the planning and implementation of small-sum loan relief measures. (5) Regarding the expansion of other transportation tools, the Public Bus Company Preparatory Committee is currently carefully formulating a plan and will first purchase a large number of vehicles to expand routes. For the connection between the suburbs of the city and the adjacent counties, the Suburban Public Bus Route Review Committee has resolved to hand over the various suburban routes to businesses for operation. After the Municipal Government approves, it will order all routes to be opened to traffic by November. The above is the process of banning rickshaws and the implementation steps passed by yesterday's municipal meeting.

### Verdict in Case Against American Reporter – Randall Declared Not Guilty – Reasons Explained in Two Parts

The News Published by the Defendant Proved Not to Be Fabricated

[Our Dispatch] The case in which Shen Ke, a German Nazi spy suspect, sued Randall, the head of the Shanghai office of the American United Press, for defamation, was pronounced by the District Court yesterday afternoon, finding Randall not guilty. The reasons for the verdict are as follows: This case is explained in two parts:

Procedural Issues

Article 311 of the Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that the victim of a crime may file a private prosecution. Therefore, the only requirement for a private prosecutor is that they are a person who has been directly harmed by the crime, and there are no other restrictions. Therefore, whether they are citizens of an enemy country or war criminals who are being repatriated is irrelevant. In this case, the private prosecutor is a German national who is being repatriated. The US Military Headquarters in China has initiated a public prosecution against them as a suspected war criminal and is currently detaining them at the US Military Headquarters in China. According to the above explanation, before our government has suspended the right of enemy aliens to sue, they are still able to file a private prosecution. Moreover, Article 23 of the 1907 Hague Convention on Land Warfare, Customary Law Convention states: "In addition to the prohibitions stipulated in special treaties, the following are specifically prohibited... Article 8 states that declaring the rights or right to sue of the people of the enemy country as invalid, or suspending or making them unenforceable in court." According to this provision, which is within the chapter on combat, this is still the case during combat. After the cessation of combat, it is even more obvious that the right to sue of the people of the enemy country cannot be suspended, because if the right to sue is not allowed, then all their private rights will be illegally infringed, disrupting social order. Therefore, modern international law provides protection for people of the enemy country residing within the jurisdictional area of the warring country's courts, and their right to sue is generally not suspended as a result. International law scholars and precedents from various countries lack precedents for this. Furthermore, according to our country's criminal law, those who are deprived of public rights are only deprived of the qualifications to be civil servants, the qualifications to be candidates for public office, and the qualifications to exercise the four powers of election, recall, initiative, and referendum. Article 36 of the Criminal Law clearly stipulates this, and the right to sue is not among those deprived. Therefore, even if the private prosecutor is a war criminal and has been deprived of public rights, their right to sue is not affected. Furthermore, Article 295 of the Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that judgments of inadmissibility should be issued in the following cases: "1. The prosecution procedure violates the regulations. 2. The case has already been prosecuted publicly or privately and is being prosecuted again in the same court. 3. For crimes that require a complaint or request, no complaint or request has been made, or the complaint or request has been withdrawn, or the complaint period has expired. 4. A decision not to prosecute or a withdrawal of prosecution has been made and is in violation of the provisions of Article 239, and a new prosecution is filed. 5. The defendant has died. 6. The court has no jurisdiction over the defendant. 7. Trial may not be conducted in accordance with the provisions of Article 8." The prosecution of enemy aliens or war criminals is not listed among these cases. If it is not accepted, there is no legal basis for it. Therefore, the private prosecution of the private prosecutor in this case is not inappropriate in terms of procedure, and this is explained first.

Substantive Issues

The private prosecutor alleges that the Shanghai English-language China Press published on April 16, 1946, an article stating that Shen Ke, a former reporter for the German Völkischer Beobachter, received special training in Germany and served as a staff member of the Nazi High Command. The US authorities claimed that Shen Ke was ordered to go to Chongqing to expose secret workers in Chongqing who were active in coastal cities, and to find routes for Americans and other prohibited personnel to escape to the free areas of China. This record was news released by the American United Press managed by the defendant, arbitrarily damaging his reputation. This court finds that the fact that the dissemination of words is sufficient to damage the reputation of others, and that this can be proven to be true, is not punishable, as Article 310, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law clearly states. In this case, the private prosecutor Shen Ke was indeed a special commissioner of the "Ehardt" agency of the German General Command's intelligence department, illegally engaged in military activities in Shanghai to resist the United States and its allies, collecting, editing, and transmitting news about the military activities of the United States and its allies' armies, navies, and air forces, and providing the "Ehardt" agency with other reports and assistance that were beneficial to the Japanese army. This has been verified by the US Military Headquarters in China and prosecuted, and was fully disclosed in the press release of the US Military Headquarters in China on June 18 of this year. Therefore, the news published by the defendant in the China Press is not without basis. Moreover, since the private prosecutor is detained at the US Military Headquarters in China as a war criminal, which is admitted by the private prosecutor, the defendant has no defamation to speak of. As for the news disclosed in the Xinwenbao Shenbao on April 16 of this year, since it was not released by the defendant's United Press, it is not related to the defendant, and it is sufficient to prove that the fact that the private prosecutor is a spy is already a well-known fact. Furthermore, although the travel passport presented by the private prosecutor is sufficient to prove that the private prosecutor had entered Vietnam via Chongqing and Guiyang in July 1941 and then transferred to Hanoi to Shanghai, the private prosecutor could not have gone to Chongqing again after arriving in Shanghai, and it is not sufficient to prove that the private prosecutor is not a spy. The certificates presented by Chen Jie and Wu Shaoshu, not to mention that the effect of these certificates is different from the sworn testimony, which is difficult to adopt as the basis for the judgment, and the defendant is indeed a spy, as has been verified by the US Military Headquarters in China and prosecuted, it is difficult to oppose it with empty certificates. Since the news published by the defendant has been proven to be non-fabricated and is not unrelated to the public interest, his behavior should not be punished. Therefore, a verdict of not guilty is rendered. Based on the above arguments and conclusions, the judgment is based on Article 393, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

### Military Forcibly Occupying Houses – To Evacuate by the End of the Month – Garrison Headquarters Convened an Executive Meeting Yesterday

### Scalpers Rampant at the North Railway Station

At 10:00 AM the day before yesterday, employees of the Shanghai Fish Market near the North Railway Station were loading and transporting fish that had arrived to the market to be concentrated for trading in accordance with the regulations. Suddenly, many scalpers swarmed forward to obstruct the transportation. The situation was tense. Later, the employees of the fish market asked the relevant sub-bureau to send police to assist, and the situation calmed down. This shows that the latent power of the scalpers in that area still exists.

### Minister Zhu Hosted Capital Press Corps Yesterday – Reported on Current Educational Issues – Investigation into Dismissal of Jinan University Professors Has Been Dispatched – Hoping to Provide as Much Relief as Possible for Students Unable to Attend School

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 27th] The Ministry of Education hosted the press corps at 9:00 AM on the 27th. Minister Zhu Jiahua gave a report on current educational issues. Directors, secretaries, supervisors, and specialists, a total of six people, accompanied him and supplemented his report: (1) Two-thirds of the schools evacuated to the rear have been restored, one-third are en route, and a small portion is still in Chongqing. The opening dates of the schools will be in early January next year. (2) Although self-funded students must take an exam, the admission standards will be lenient. Zhu said: He hoped that the people of the country would not ignore China's scientific progress in the past 20 years. Domestic research institutes are available for further study, and it is not necessary to study abroad at one's own expense unless absolutely necessary, because the exchange rate is very high. The increase in the number of Chinese people will result in a large foreign exchange loss. The central government has approved 100 translators for studying abroad. The translators requested an increase to 360, which has been submitted to the central government for approval.

Admission Quotas for Studying Abroad

(3) For the study abroad exam, the Ministry of Education will select 120 government-funded students, 50 Sino-French exchange students, and 20 from the Sino-British Education Fund (i.e., the Boxer Indemnity Fund) Board of Directors, for a total of 190 students, and the results will be announced soon. (4) The Ministry of Education can only provide convenience for college students evacuated from the rear who return to their hometowns to transfer to other schools, but cannot assign them. They must take the entrance exams themselves. (5) All levels of schools are overcrowded. In recent years, education has generally developed, but wartime school buildings have been damaged. Due to economic reasons, it is not easy to restore them, which is an inevitable trend. The United States also has hundreds of thousands of students who are unable to attend school. The ministry will make its best effort to provide as much relief as possible.

Secondary and Elementary Schools to Implement Two-Part System

(6) There are currently 182 colleges and universities with 120,000 students, 1,163,000 secondary school students, and 18,600,000 elementary school students. (7) Secondary and elementary schools have implemented a two-part system, which allows each school to enroll twice as many students, thereby increasing capacity. (8) During the war, resources were scarce, equipment was simple, and the education level was reduced. We will try to improve this in the future. (9) Regarding the dismissal of professors from Jinan University, Supervisor Tong Daxi has been dispatched to Shanghai immediately to investigate the truth, in order to resolve the matter fairly and reasonably.

Requesting Additional Funds for Restoration

(10) For the restoration of the entire education system, the central government has approved 60 billion yuan for travel and repair expenses for various schools. Due to rising prices and increased transportation costs, the actual difference is very large. We have requested the Executive Yuan to add 120 billion yuan in accordance with the standard that administrative expenses should not exceed two to four times the amount approved by the central government. We are still awaiting approval. (11) After the victory, our international status has increased, and international cultural cooperation affairs have become more complex. The Higher Education Department previously had a section to handle this matter. In the future, the section will be changed to a department to strengthen the work. In addition, cultural commissioners or counselors will be stationed in the embassies of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union to facilitate progress. This matter is also being submitted for approval.

Extending Government Funding for Students for One Year

(12) It is still difficult to stop government funding for students in national secondary schools and above due to the economic situation in various places and the burden on people's lives. We have requested an extension of one year, ending in the summer of next year. Subsidies for government funding for students in private schools have also been requested to be extended for one year. However, government funding for new students has been completely stopped.

### Fu Sinian to Fly to Nanjing Tomorrow – Will Report a Traitor Before Leaving Beiping

[Our Dispatch from Beiping, 26th] Fu Sinian will leave Beiping and fly to Nanjing on the 29th. He said today that he will report a traitor before leaving Beiping, implying that the traitor is someone who once served as the puppet president of Peking University but escaped justice. He is reporting this because he is the acting president of Peking University, so he believes that all heads should report puppet heads equivalent to them. Fu believes that the acquittal of Zhang Yanqing is "the worst major event." Fu criticized the Hebei-Chahar-Suiyuan District Investigation Team, saying that "their investigations often cut people off arbitrarily," but said that "the case of Liu Naiyi's large-scale search was handled quite well." Finally, he lamented the low salaries of professors, saying, "It is fundamentally impossible to conduct academic research."

### An Urgent Proposal – Raise Teacher Salaries

US Education Authorities at Washington Conference

[US Information Service, Washington, 27th] US education authorities recently convened a conference here to address the unprecedented surge in student numbers and the nationwide teacher shortage, and put forward an urgent proposal to increase teacher salaries to at least $45 per week or $2,400 per year. Currently, the average annual salary of teachers is less than $2,000, which is far lower than other public officials, resulting in about 350,000 of the 850,000 teachers switching careers. The reasons for the current shortage of competent teachers can be summarized as follows: (1) The number of normal school students decreased during the war, (2) The rapid increase in the birth rate has led to an increase in school-age children, (3) Most of those who originally intended to dedicate themselves to education have switched careers, and most of the soldiers returning from overseas intend to continue their education and are unwilling to take on the task of teachers in public schools with low salaries.

### Peking University Stipulates Regulations for Professors Holding Additional Classes

[Our Newspaper, Beiping Dispatch] Regulations for professors holding additional classes at Peking University have been stipulated: (1) Full-time professors and associate professors are not allowed to hold other paid positions outside the university. Those holding additional classes outside the university are limited to four hours per week, and must obtain prior consent from the dean and department head, with a written record kept at the Academic Affairs Office. (2) Full-time lecturers and teaching assistants are not allowed to hold any positions outside the university.

### Having shots that never miss, the Masses overwhelm the Giants; The game tight, 42 to 32, only ten points apart; Reporters defeat star Wei Ming

[Our Dispatch] Last night, the Masses basketball team defeated the Giants, a strong Western team. The intense and exciting game brought the four thousand fans to their feet with cheers.

Last night, Chairman Qian Dajun and Vice Chairman Wu Shaoshu of the Sports Association were present to watch the game, the excitement was unprecedented. The Giants used a very tight man-to-man and collective defense under the basket to counter the Masses, but it was still broken through by the Masses. The Masses were very cautious, so the scoring was relatively low. In the third quarter, the Masses attempted a stalling tactic, which gave the Giants an opportunity to score. The defenders on both sides displayed their strengths, but the Masses' ability to make every shot, leaving no space uncovered, was the key to victory.

### Recent Sharp Rise in US Dollars; Financial Inspection Office Finds Organized Speculation; San Taiyu and Two Qianzhuang Heavily Suspected

[Our Dispatch] According to Li Lixia, the director of the Financial Institutions Reporting Office of the Central Bank, the recent fluctuations in the market for US dollars and various foreign currencies were purely caused by organized investment trading. After a close inspection, the organization recently discovered that the purchase figures reported daily by some foreign currency trading qianzhuang are  inconsistent with the exchange numbers of each zhuang in the clearing houses. Among them, San Taiyu and the two qianzhuang are the most suspected. Therefore, the Central Bank dispatched responsible personnel to check the accounts of the two zhuang yesterday. If the circumstances are serious, the perpetrators will be prosecuted according to law. The other suspected zhuang are also being strictly investigated. At the same time, all sectors of society are urged to report any zhuang found to be engaged in such speculative activities to the Financial Inspection Office of the Central Bank, so as to facilitate investigation and handling, rectify the business of each zhuang, and stabilize the financial market. It is also reported that San Tai qianzhuang, which is suspected this time, was the main protagonist in the Central Bank gold case three months ago. The zhuang was suspended from business for buying stolen gold from the Central Bank. It was closed not long ago, and then engaged in back door transactions, which is extremely inappropriate. As far as the zhuang's telephone line is concerned, there are dozens of them. The Central Bank is currently investigating thoroughly.

After Strict Inspection, Gold and Silver Both Became Stable

Last night, the Central Bank continued to strengthen controls, coupled with strict account checking, speculators did not dare to be active, and continued to stabilize. The highest opening was 2,155,000, which rose slightly to 2,167,000. In the end, the pressure increased, the account books of small money changers on Sichuan Road were inspected, people's hearts were unfavorable, and gradually returned to normal. After 10 o'clock, the Central Bank allocated 50 bars at a price of 2,150,000, and became more gloomy after 10 o'clock. It once fell to 2,140,000 before noon, and recovered slightly at noon. In the afternoon, the spot exchange was mediocre, and the next day's transaction moved at 2,170,000 before the final decision. The result was similar to the previous closing. The secret interest was still around one and a half corners.

Foreign currencies were stable and changed little. The highest price of the US dollar at the beginning was no more than 3,970 yuan, and the lowest price in the middle was still at 3,900 yuan. The price was slightly stable at noon. The intentions of both buyers and sellers were consistent, and the process was very peaceful. In the afternoon, the price rose slightly to 3,990 yuan following the gold market, and then finalized, resulting in an increase of 10 yuan compared with the previous closing. Hong Kong notes were stable, also rising by 5 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate hovered around 780 yuan. The immediate exchange rate fell to 955 yuan for sale and 935 yuan for purchase. The British exchange rate was still between 12,500 yuan and 12,700 yuan, with no major changes. There was no direct quotation for the US exchange rate.

Bonds Stable

Yesterday, foreign firms purchased Class A and B bonds, so the situation stabilized slightly. For Unified C bonds, the highest opening price was 1,800 yuan, and after the opening, it rose to 1,850 yuan. When the bank suddenly started to supply, it was immediately unsustainable, and the price dropped again to 1,720 yuan. Finally, seeing the stability of the difficult cards, it closed outside 1,800, resulting in a slight increase of 30 yuan compared with the previous closing. Classes A and B rose from 1,050 to outside 1,100, also a good 30 yuan, Class rose 50 yuan, and Class E was flat.

Foreign Stocks Slightly Up

Foreign stocks gradually picked up yesterday. Da Kang Cheng came in, and some parts saw gains. Yi Yarn was at 8,400 yuan, Yinglian at 10,200 yuan, and Yi Beer at 2,150 yuan, gradually improving. The results were slightly better than the previous closing. Yi Yarn, Yinglian, Huadefeng, and Asian Copper each rose nearly equally, Paper and Yi Beer rose slightly, and Guang was flat.

### Northeast Direct Remittances; Bank of China Handles Free of Charge

More than a year has passed since the victory. Due to currency issues, the Northeast has not yet remitted funds. Recently, the Central Bank formulated measures for industrial and commercial remittances and drafted exchange rates, which were reported to the Economic Committee of the Northeast Headquarters and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. The Bank of China here is aiming to connect the economic relations between the Northeast and the mainland and develop industry and commerce. It has started handling remittances to the Northeast based on the Northeast industrial and commercial remittance measures. Remittances to and from Shenyang and Jinzhou have already been opened. Funds remitted from Shanghai to the Northeast will be converted into Northeast circulating coupons and paid to the recipient according to the Central Bank's exchange rate on the day. Funds remitted from the Northeast to this place will also be converted into legal currency at the exchange rate on the day. In order to support industry and commerce, the Bank of China will waive all remittance fees. According to the exchange rate quoted by the Central Bank, the outgoing exchange rate is one to eleven yuan and five jiao, and the incoming exchange rate is one to twelve yuan and five jiao. It is reported that the National Bank of China will also continue to handle Northeast remittances to Changchun, Yingkou, and Siping Street. Once the link is smooth, people inside and outside Guan are extremely excited. In recent days, people going to the bank to remit money have been very enthusiastic.

### 6% British Gold Loan; Last Drawing Scheduled for End of Month

The twenty-fifth drawing of the The Chinese Government 23rd Year 1924 6% Sterling Indemnity Loan will be held publicly at 10:00 AM on Monday, the 30th of this month, in the Department of Public Debt of the Ministry of Finance at Guotuan Minghui Wu Bazhansizhong. It is reported that this will be the last drawing.

### Artificial Silk Rises Again by 700,000; Market Exists but No Goods; Only Four or Five Boxes Traded; Japanese Goods on the Way, Exact Number Unknown

The rise in artificial silk prices is jaw-dropping. Yesterday, it rose wildly again by more than 700,000 yuan. No. 120 Tianqiao opened at 650,000 yuan, an increase of more than 300,000 yuan compared with the afternoon of the previous day. Afterwards, it rose even higher, closing at 900,000 yuan. In the afternoon, the last transaction was at 4,970,000 yuan. The prices of various brand names also followed suit, rising by 600,000 to 700,000 yuan each. However, due to the shortage of goods, although the market price was high, only four or five boxes were actually traded. According to industry insiders, given the current situation, unless the source of artificial silk is found and the supply is increased, the market sentiment will remain bullish. Manufacturers have strong demand, while the actual inventory in the market is dwindling day by day. The inventory of commercial firms is even more limited, and the demand for those who need it to search and purchase becomes more and more urgent, and the price only rises and does not fall. It is urgently hoped that the relevant authorities will start from unblocking the source and increasing the supply. The reporter then visited Mr. He Zonglin, the manager of the Material Procurement and Barter Department of the Central Trust Bureau, to inquire about the shipment of Japanese artificial silk. According to him, part of the barter trade with Japan handled by the Bureau is indeed artificial silk. As for the exact quantity, because it fluctuates from time to time, it is not possible to announce a definite number. Recently, a batch of artificial silk has indeed been loaded on ships from Japan. As for the exact date of arrival, because no telegram has been received, the details are unknown. However, it is expected that it will arrive within days. After the arrival of this batch of artificial silk, we will consider evaluating the supply to meet the needs of the market.

### Allotted Yarn Prices Unchanged; 3,600 Pieces Allotted; Sales Not Enough, Also Affected by the Cloth Market; Cotton Cloth Still Mostly Marked Up and No Sellers

[Our Dispatch] The yarn market was slightly flat at the beginning, with prices falling compared to yesterday. 42-count spot was 2.9 million, futures were 2.8 million, and 20-count remained at the original price. Transactions are no longer as strong as before. Then, the Tianjin gang absorbed it, and the cloth mills also made up for their insufficient supply of allocated raw materials at low prices, and the price rose again by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. However, most people in the market are wary of the style of the building that will leave the cloth open the day before, increasing sales, so the market price in the morning was generally flat. In the afternoon, it became firm again. In addition to actual sales accounts coming in at low prices, the improvement in the cloth market also brought up the price a lot. If the guest gang does not have a large number of purchases, the yarn market will turn into a spinning game.

The Yarn Allocation and Joint Sales Committee held its routine meeting to open yarn yesterday afternoon. It was decided to open for sale 20-count standard cotton yarn, with a quota of 2,706 pieces for private factories and 907 pieces for the Textile Construction (the Textile Construction Company's figure is 910 pieces), all of which were allocated separately according to the application amount. The selling price is 1.55 million yuan per piece, with 400 pounds of 20-count cotton yarn as the standard. The next opening date was decided to be September 30.

The cloth market's rising momentum has continued for two weeks. Since a large number of textiles were opened up the night before, the prices were high, and those who got the goods did not dare to hold on. Therefore, the market was tired at the beginning yesterday. Blue V fine cloth was 90,000 yuan, three A colored balls were 84,000 yuan, and Yanghe Wufu was 81,200 yuan. In addition, the street sales were greatly reduced due to the cloudy and rainy weather. Actual sales accounts did not wait and see. Loose households sold their allotted goods at discounted prices due to tight finances, so the market situation was deteriorating. Unbranded colored balls were discounted by 3,000, white printed cotton was discounted by 5,000, and Gan branch unbranded was discounted by nearly 1,000 yuan. This is a great warning for those who are used to applying for goods. Later, the dye continuing factory and the strong guest sales cloth shop absorbed the low prices, and the prices rose again due to the good prices. Not only did no one sell at discounted prices, but the high-end goods were even tighter with more markups. Some cotton fabrics had markups of 3,000 to 4,000 yuan, but there were no sellers. According to market news, the guest gangs have not yet eaten enough. If the construction department does not change its allocation policy, the rising momentum will be difficult to suppress. As for the news spread outside that Huang Niu and Dangmanji were accumulating goods, it is said that it is purely speculation outside the industry and not the truth. News revealed by Tianjin gang said that the road here is mostly broken into pieces, and then transferred to the Northeast. Although the transport is difficult, there is a severe shortage of goods in the local area, and it is said that there are several famous white goods brands in this city that have already sent people to Tianjin to set up zhuangkou to promote business.

### International Chamber of Commerce Report; Rate Stability is Still Early; Inflation Should be Curb

[Reuters, London, 26th Dispatch] The International Chamber of Commerce recently submitted a report to the United Nations Economic and Social Council, emphasizing the instability of prices in various countries around the world. It pointed out that inflation is the most urgent phenomenon in the world today and may repeat the price situation of 1920-1921. To some extent, this situation is not caused solely by monetary reasons, such as a lack of materials, insufficient production, and high costs. However, in most countries, currency plays an important role, so preventing inflation should be the top priority. However, in some countries, the internal situation is unstable and it is not easy to do so for a while, so it is necessary to find ways to provide relief during this transition period. The stability and other issues in the world must be resolved before it is possible to hope for stable exchange rates and international investment.

### Hardware Prices Rise in a Straight Line

Since rumors of foreign exchange caused prices to change, guest gangs have been purchasing in large quantities, resulting in a shortage of spot goods. Steel plate prices were very sluggish because there was a rumor that the remaining materials from the Japanese remnant birds would be shipped to China. Most parts and hardware are produced by the factory, and the trip to the factory is affected by work and sales, forming a straight line rise.

### Industrial Raw Materials Fall

Yesterday, the black market for US dollars stabilized slightly. Industrial raw materials fell, and transactions were also sparse. The price of caustic soda, which had risen to 800,000 yuan per barrel three days ago, has fallen to 690,000 yuan. Other items such as soda ash and bleaching powder have also fallen. Vanillin and white alkali have arrived in large quantities, and prices have not improved. Water glass, which once rose to less than 100 yuan per pound, has recently risen to 140 yuan per pound, but the cost of foreign orders is 250 yuan per pound.

### Chinese Stocks Tired First, Then Good, Closing Prices High

Chinese stocks did not see strong trading yesterday, but new buyers joined in. However, transactions were limited. The machine surface gang suddenly panicked in the middle, and the situation was very unfavorable. Each stock was slightly firm at the morning opening, and there was a northern plate in. However, at this time, the Ying gang sold high, and soon the board was small at high prices. The mid-way trading piano was quiet, and the machine surface gang was uneasy, and the situation was extremely difficult for an hour. It was not until 11:30 that a ray of light appeared. The Guangdong gang first came to maintain Yong yarn, and the securities gang also purchased Meyer. There were a lot of rebounds on the machine surface, and the situation gradually improved. Around 5 o'clock, the financial gang also came to force purchases. The buying intention gradually increased, and they rose sharply, making high prices in the short-selling market, and the ground was tired after closing. As a result, Yong Yarn, Meyer, Jingfu, and Xinguang stocks were all about half good compared to the previous closing. Among the cold stocks, Tongyi, Huafeng, and Yong Cement were still slightly lower, Rongjian Xian was flat, China Textile rose by a little less than 10%, and the rest all rose slightly. The total transaction volume was about 780,000 shares, and the rise and fall of off-market stocks were small.

### South China Yarn and Cloth Exports Can Be Applied for Next Week; To the Ministry of Finance's Order to Implement

As for the formal export, it will be implemented after the customs receives a formal notice from the Ministry of Finance. As for the issue of national cotton procurement, the spinning construction department previously received 15 billion yuan of loans from the Central Bank. Although the formal contract has not been signed, the principle is generally no problem. The spinning construction department has mobilized Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Zhangde, Nanyuan, Gaomi, Hankou, Nantong and other places to receive reports. As of yesterday, a total of 30,000 bales had been received. As for the acquisition by private enterprises, it is planned to organize a loan of 20 billion yuan in the form of mortgage financing. The detailed measures have been drafted and submitted to the relevant authorities for approval.

### China Trust Bureau Standard Sales Materials; Tenders to Open This Month Afternoon

### The Market Price of Aged Tea Rises

Foreign Firm Tea Market: Yesterday, 110 boxes of aged Zhong Hao tea were absorbed by the same foreign firm, and over 700 boxes were acquired by the Wu Chang Tea Company. The highest price per box has risen to 145,000 yuan, an increase of more than 5,000 yuan compared to the previous price. Similarly, the daily reported price of aged Xia tea has increased from 90,000 to 95,000 yuan. Other aged teas such as Chou Zhen, Zhen Mei, Fujian Xiao Zhong, and aged Wen Hong tea are being significantly purchased by Yong Fa, Xinhua, Hua Cha Wang Yu Tai, and Yuan Li. Internal sales of black and green tea remain consistent, but due to the rain, transactions in Shui Street shops and those in the Suzhou and Wuxi areas have not increased.

### Wool and Textile Industry Requests Exemption from Commodity Tax; Tianjin Counterparts Send Letters in Support

The Municipal Wool and Textile Dyeing Industry Association believes that the widespread use and high tax rates on wool fabrics and wool products are beyond the capacity of various factories to bear. The association requests that the government make a decision to reduce the burden, or at least postpone the implementation. The association recently received letters from counterparts in Tianjin, who also unanimously advocate for a joint approach to address the issue, fearing that the entire wool textile industry will collapse under the pressure of foreign goods dumping.

### Silk and Wool: American Merchants Urge Expedited Exports, Fearing Loss to Other Countries

[United Press Washington, 16th] The U.S. agricultural delegation to China stated today that both the production and the purchase volume of Chinese silk and wool can be greatly improved. However, difficulties may arise due to increased costs, transportation delays, and recent exchange rate fluctuations. The agricultural delegation recently held a ten-day meeting with commercial representatives from Shanghai, advocating for taking advantage of the current market opportunities to immediately purchase large quantities of silk and wool to supply the American market, fearing that otherwise, it will be seized by other countries.

Change of Manager at He Cheng Bank

He Cheng Bank is a commercial bank with considerable success in the southwestern financial industry.

Mr. Zhi has many years of experience in the financial industry and is a backbone figure of the bank. It is scheduled to officially take over on October 1st.

### Taiwan Rice Distributed Yesterday: Over 7,000 Bags in the North and South Markets; Price at 53,000 Yuan per Shi

Due to rain, the rice market saw fewer transactions as goods could not be measured on the riverbank. However, sentiment remains firm, and tax rice is slightly tight, with an increase of 1,000 yuan. White rice is still in short supply. Chen rice is stable due to concerns about deterioration. Other rice varieties are still in demand. Taiwan rice was officially distributed in the afternoon market today, with 4,650 bags in the southern market and 2,650 bags in the northern market, priced at 53,000 yuan. Purchases are still good.

### On the Friendship Between Wang Anshi and Su Shi

— Fa Wei Hong

"Women scorn women," which is of course not a normal phenomenon in the literary world. As for "politics overshadowing friendship," that is even more so when women insist on confining themselves to a "narrow cage," so why bother to say it's normal! Mr. Zhongming said it well: "Literary friends need to have broad minds and not hate each other because of differences in political positions or opinions. Don't expect your literary friends to all be your comrades. You must be able to accommodate literary friends from all parties." (See the article "Literary Friendship and Political Relations" in the September 11 issue of this publication.) Therefore, I am reminded of the friendship between Wang Anshi and Su Shi, which did not change due to differences in political positions or opinions.

Everyone knows that Su Shi was one of the most vigorous critics of Wang Anshi's New Policies. When he was the magistrate of Kaifeng Prefecture in the fourth year of the Xining reign of Emperor Shenzong of Song, he submitted a memorial criticizing the New Policies as inconvenient. Later, the censor Xie Jingwen used another matter to impeach Su Shi, and Su Shi was transferred to Hangzhou as a judge. Su Shi was repeatedly demoted and suffered many hardships thereafter, all related to his criticism of the New Policies. From a political standpoint, they were on opposite sides. But they did not change their friendship because of this, and they admired each other's literary and artistic achievements. Let's look at the following records:

"When Dongpo wrote the Stele for the Temple of Loyalty, Jinggong placed it in the corner. A guest asked, 'Does Prime Minister like this person's work?' Jinggong said, 'This is very much like the Western Han.' The guest praised him endlessly. Jinggong smiled and said, 'Who in the Western Han can compare?' Some guests compared him to Sima Xiangru and Yang Xiong. Jinggong said, 'Xiangru's 'Fu of Sir, Vast and Great,' and his "Letter to Convey Dissuasion from Hunting’ are the greatest works. Xiong's 'Tai Xuan' and 'Fa Yan' are based on the Book of Changes, but I have not seen him narrate events and gaze like this. He should be allowed to gallop up and down with Zichang, like the Chronicles of the Princes and Kings since the Chu-Han period!'" [Pan Zizhen's Shihua]

"When Shu Wang was at Zhongshan, a guest came from Huangzhou. Gong said, 'What wonderful words has Dongpo said recently?' The guest said, 'Dongpo stayed overnight at the Linfu Pavilion, woke up from a drunken dream, and wrote a record of the scenic spots of Chengdu, more than a thousand words, finalizing only one or two words. There is a handwritten copy, which is left in the boat. Gong sent someone to fetch it. At that time, there was a forest shadow on the ground coming from the southeast. Gong unfolded and read it under the windy eaves, and he saw the joy of his eyebrows, saying, 'Zizhan is a dragon among men! However, one word is not stable.' The guest said, 'What do you mean?' Gong said, 'Day by day wins poverty, it is better to say like good gamblers, day by day loses.' Dongpo heard this, clapped his hands and laughed loudly, and also regarded Gong as a knowledgeable person." [Hui Hong's Leng Zhai Yehua]

"When Dongpo was in Huangzhou, he wrote a poem about snow: 'Frozen and coalesced jade vest rises millet, light shakes silver sea dazzling flowers.' People do not know that he used allusions. Later, he moved to Ruhai, passed Jinling, and saw Wang Jinggong to discuss poetry and said this: 'Taoists use the two shoulders as jade vests, and the eyes as silver seas, is this what you are using?' Dongpo laughed at it. He retreated and said to Ye Zhiyuan, 'How can those who learn from Jinggong be so knowledgeable!'" [Zhao De Lin's Hou Qinglu]

"All the officials sent lyrics to Guizhixiang in Quangling Huaigu, a total of more than thirty poems, but only Jie Fu's was the most superb. When Dongpo saw it, he couldn't help but sigh, 'This old man is a fox spirit!'" [Yang Ti's Gujin Cihua] How much they cherished each other! This is precisely because they both valued friendship. As for the difference in political positions or opinions, that is another matter and need not be discussed together. Zhu Sheng's Quhu Jiuwen said:

"Dongpo was transferred from Huang to Ru, passed Jinling, and Jinggong wore casual clothes and rode a donkey to visit him at the boat station. Dongpo greeted him without wearing a hat and said, 'I, Shi, dare to see the Prime Minister in casual clothes today.' Jinggong smiled and said, 'Are rituals set up for us?' Dongpo said, 'I also know that you won't use me in your school.' Jinggong was speechless, so he invited him to visit Jiangshan."

Su Shi's words naturally contained thorns, but they were still tactful, and there was neither anger nor a break in friendship. Isn't this something that the modern literary world can emulate?

Now, I have something else to mention. Later, after Wang Anshi died, the court discussed awarding him the title of Grand Tutor, and Su Shi wrote the imperial edict, praising his great virtue. For example, he said that he "netted the lost texts of the Six Classics, and decided them with his own intention; refined the dross of the hundred schools of thought, and made new this man. During the period of the Xining reign, he crowned the virtuous and was useful, and he was trusted, something that had never happened in ancient or modern times. Just as his achievements were about to be completed, the rebellion began; floating clouds were nothing, and he shed them like they were lost; he repeatedly contended for seats with fishermen and woodcutters, and did not disturb the deer; the occasion of his advance and retreat was admirable." How appropriate this praise is! Chen Shan's Mufeng Xinyu said that this edict was Su Shi's words of long-standing regret, which is a colored-glasses view. After reading this edict and looking at the current literary world, there should be many feelings: Is it true that political relations are more important than friendship, and is it true that ancient and modern people are not related?

### A Record of Artistic Terms

— Ma Chao Ying

Primitive Art

In English it is Primitive Art. It is the art that occurred in primitive times. The art produced by the fear and doubt of nature, and the fear and praise of God, arising from this state of mind, is primitive art. Also, utilitarian art generally has the characteristics of being naive, clumsy, and simple, and is also called primitive art.

Plastic Arts

In English it is Bildende Kunst. Specifically refers to painting, sculpture, architecture and the art of the sense of touch. This is in contrast to the art of sound and rhythm, such as poetry, music, and dance. This type of art has three characteristics: * Using tangible materials, * Occupying space or a point in space, * Can interact with the visual senses. At the same time, there is a difference between plastic arts and figurative arts (Bildkunst), and spatial art (Art of Space). The former refers specifically to painting and sculpture, while the latter refers to decoration and so on.

### Entering the City (Photography)

### An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 46

— Ye Jin Feng

Tomorrow! July 27th. The night before, I lay awake all night until dawn, as the artillery fire continued incessantly, only occasionally becoming slightly sparse, but not for long before intensifying again. According to news exchanged from various radio stations, this action was entirely due to the personal opinion of Matsui and a few others, who probably wanted to use this artillery fire to intimidate Song Zheyuan into signing a troop withdrawal agreement; in this way, the Japanese intelligence agents and military leaders stationed in Beiping could make up for their failures.

However, Song was being held by several high-ranking military and political officials in Beiping and Wanping, and he also felt that the Japanese were not giving him enough face, forcing him to sign the withdrawal, which smacked too much of a "treaty under the city walls," so he also wanted to resist the Japanese army.

At dawn on this day, around six o'clock, the Japanese artillery fire suddenly stopped. According to news from Mr. W, the Japanese sent a liaison officer for one last time to request a face-to-face conversation with Song himself, regardless of whether he agreed or refused, as long as he gave his word. This, of course, was rejected again. According to news from the Shen Staff Headquarters, this last envoy contact was ordered by the headquarters; if Matsui and others did not comply, they would face severe punishment. Matsui, being cunning, feigned compliance, only sending two or three lower-ranking adjutants and attendants to the Jinde Society's headquarters, loitering for a while before leaving and returning to the office, saying that "the Chinese side has formally refused." Matsui then reported this.

As soon as this "report" was sent in code, the artillery fire resumed. Immediately following, twelve planes took off in four groups and dropped bombs indiscriminately on the suburbs of Beiping and the vicinity of Wanping. This was neither strategic bombing nor positional bombing; if one had to give it a name, it could probably be called "terror bombing," because the bombs were dropped with too little aim, and most of the destroyed buildings were temples, schools, and residences; nine out of ten people killed were innocent civilians. After the bombing, they added strafing, and after the strafing, it was back to bombing, until the bombs and bullets were used up before they retreated. All that remained in the bombed areas were piles of rubble and ashes, and scattered limbs and bones. The cries of mothers calling for their sons and fathers calling for their children were truly tragic and heart-wrenching.

On this day, the people of Ping, Wan, and Qu passed the day in terror under the fire of cannons and planes, clinging to their lives. The strangest thing was that despite the turmoil, the Japanese army remained on their own positions, not advancing a single step, and our side, not having received an attack order, naturally did not attack, only firing a few shots at them from the artillery, just going through the motions. The evening was relatively calm. Perhaps this was the momentary calm before a huge storm.

With frequent telecommunications, I went to Dingyuan's place twice in the morning and evening. Because of the ground-shaking artillery fire all night, he had another sleepless night, and only slept for two or three hours in the early morning. The daytime air raids made him uneasy, and he was not as spirited as the day before. I told them that I had already spoken with Mr. W on the phone about the situation in Changxindian, and explained the issue of their family participating in military work. Mr. W expressed great agreement and promised to proceed immediately.

According to Mr. W's opinion, this matter did not seem to be a problem and they could join at any time; that is to say, their family could enlist whenever they were ready, and even join the Wanping garrison's Xingwen Corps nearby for temporary work, which was also a viable option. But Dingyuan's opinion was that they must first identify a corps, complete the formal appointment procedures, and participate formally according to regulations. This was the obstruction of a long-standing habit of English gentleman style. During our two meetings, we made this issue the focus of our conversation.

### Record of Sichuan Mountain and Water Paintings

— Zhao Jing Shen

I am a native of Yibin, Sichuan, but I have never been to Sichuan. The year before last, when I went to the rear, I had already arrived in Lihuang, Anhui, and I wanted to enter Sichuan from Henan and Shaanxi, but unfortunately the Pinghan Railway was cut off, and I still could not go to see the place where my ancestors were. However, these two days have given me compensation, and that is the national exhibition of Quan Wu Guanggfu and Wu Yingbao.

Coincidentally, Mr. Wu Guangfu had also been to our Yibin, and left traces: "A Scene of the Taoist Temple in the River in Yibin" and "Pigeon House in Yibin". In the former, water flows between the two mountains. It is said that the water is very rapid, merges with the river water, and creates torrents, washing between the rocks and flowing in circles, showing Mr. Wu's specialty of viewing water. The way he paints the water flow is different from the average person, and it can be said that he has created his own style. The latter is located in the high mountains, with two Buddha statues sculpted in the rocks. The water flows rapidly under the mountain, and three boatmen (the "boatmen" that Ye Shengtao spoke of) are working hard to prop up a sailboat. I had the drawing outlined and kept as a souvenir.

I read Fan Chengda's Travels to Mount Emei, and the cloud scenery made me yearn for it so much that I couldn't wait to go and enjoy that kind of realm myself. Now that I have seen Mr. Wu's (Mount Emei's Golden Summit Cloud Color), I know that what Fan Chengda described was not false. That kind of vast and boundless scenery is indeed great and magnificent, but Mr. Wu's brushwork is sufficient to support it.

Mr. Wu's paintings imitate Shi Tao a lot, and he likes this old bitter gourd's landscape paintings the most. In addition, he also imitated Song Huizong, Mi Fu, Lu Baoshan, and Jin Dongxin. But he copied the works of various masters, but he was not bound by them. Mr. Wu is still Mr. Wu after all. Sometimes he boldly breaks through the traditional patterns of Chinese painting, and only paints half of the boat or people at the end, like this method of cutting off at the waist, the ancients may have regarded it as a taboo. ("Gorge Boat" and "Great Emei Jieyin Temple"). He also did not hesitate to add mountain shadows to "Jialing Dawn Raft". His special method of painting water is especially his proud work, he painted the water alive!

Mr. Wu's paintings left a deep impression on me, and in my personal feeling, the best works are still the following: "Autumn Colors of Stream and Mountain" and "Cloud Colors of Great Emei" are both delicate and elegant. "Yuanming's Leisurely Mood" depicts Tao Qian drinking wine, with a waiter supporting him. The waiter is painted the best, with his eyes staring straight, as if he is working very hard. I have seen the calligraphy and painting photos of the London exhibition in the Commercial Press edition. The original face of Zhou Yuzhi's waiter was not fully revealed. Far inferior to Mr. Wu's painting. "Spring Mountain Ruisong" is sparse and well-proportioned, with a very design-like flavor. "Shu Mountain Travelers" and "Guiyang Huaji Ling Mountain" are both excellent works of realism. The former depicts towering mountains and ridges, high and shading the sun, and the latter depicts the scenery of Ling Mountain, making people linger. There is also a painting "Shiming Qingxiang Green Landscape," the shadowy small boat and the chaotic mountain colors are dim, which reminds me of the return journey to Hangzhou Xixi that time. I said to Yao Fu: "This one can be said to be the scenery of dusk, right? Like Monet's painting of haystacks, we are reluctant to call the bright mountain color the daytime, and the dark mountain color the dusk, what do you think?" He also nodded casually. I don't care whether he agrees or not, anyway, I have already enjoyed it with relish.

Mr. Wang Yingbao's paintings are not as strong as Yao Fu's in terms of color, but he is more inclined to the meticulous aspect than Yao Fu. His paintings are also often smaller than Yao Fu's, and sometimes the narrow vertical or narrow horizontal strips also have a special charm. General appreciators especially appreciate his waterfalls, and what he paints are all waterfalls. He also inscribed poems on the paintings, but the title of the painting is also a excerpt from the poem. In this way, except for letting us know that he painted it in Chongqing Zhangyuan or Hexiang Caotang, we don't know what place he painted, and it is not as interesting as Yan Dingming's note of Wushan Gorge. I guess that he probably paints more of the freehand style than the realistic style, the composition may be more complete than Yao Fu, but the sense of reality or obvious personality seems to be relatively less. But he did not completely disappoint me, because he had clearly noted a Qingcheng Mountain in the style of Zhang Daqian; my purpose is probably to especially focus on certain special landscapes of Shu Mountain, such as Yao Fu's Giant Buddha Rock. In the past, Zong Shaowen traveled to the Five Mountains, and thanked Mr. Wu Guangfu, now I can be said to be "standing-traveling" in the mountains and rivers of Sichuan.

Free Talk

### White Criminals

— Shao Fu

Now some people call friends who specialize in riding in white cars to watch free shows "white criminals", this term is quite elegant. It is said that in Fuzhou, in order to rectify social mores, the authorities once mobilized the military, police, and gendarmerie on a large scale, arrested more than 100 of these white people, men and women, and punished them by using several large trucks to take them in white cars once more in the evening, and sending them to the suburbs sixty miles away to release them, and let them run back to the city. That night was a night of great wind and rain, and it is said that these characters walked back to the city crying and weeping all night.

Thinking about the scene at that time is indeed a ridiculous and comical scene! This method of punishment, I don't know which master of humor came up with, to be honest, it is very interesting.

I often think that there are many administrative punishments in China that are full of human touch, and the method of dealing with these friends who ride in white cars to watch free shows is one example. Some people say that this method is somewhat frivolous and abusive, but in fact it is very interesting!

There are also quite a few white friends in Shanghai who ride in white cars to watch free shows, I am afraid that the authorities have not yet come up with a more appropriate method. The method of sending them to the suburbs for release in Fuzhou seems to be able to be emulated, but it is best to release them to Pudong and let them cross the Huangpu River to see the long river, but in this way, both land and water are dispatched, which is also a huge project.

News Data

### Gazelle People and Others

— Mi Shan

Recently, the "Gazelle People" discovered in the outer deserts have become excellent news items for various newspapers. The characteristics of the so-called "Gazelle People" are: first, their actions and calls are like those of gazelles, they only eat green grass and do not eat ordinary food, but they are clearly "people"; second, they run extremely fast, being able to run fifty miles per hour, which is more than two and a half times the world record for the 100-yard dash, but this "Gazelle Person" is only fifteen years old.

After this news spread, people all over the world found it very interesting, and natural scientists and medical scientists also encountered unprecedented problems. British people said, "I hope to urge him to attend the next World Games."

Several years ago, in the "Luogan" area of Sumatra, an animal that looked like a human and like a monkey was also discovered. The local natives called him "Guman." His height was only about one meter, his eyes were bright, he walked as fast as lightning, and he would run away immediately when he saw people, disappearing in an instant. His lifestyle was exactly like that of apes and monkeys, but his physiological form was clearly human. If we infer according to the current name of "Gazelle People," then that kind of person can be called "Ape-Monkey People."

"Gazelle People" and "Ape-Monkey People" are all formed by being influenced by living in animal groups since childhood, affecting their lifestyle and actions, and due to physiological peculiarities or abnormalities, forming strange "special figures." Here is a note:

Strange

In 1935, a commercial painter in Chicago, USA, named Sam Becker, had a big change in his body: his head suddenly swelled three times, his neck shortened and was "eliminated", his body bent, his legs were bent, his arms stretched out and were thin, and his body shortened day by day; what's even better is that he felt a strange pain and itching between his buttocks at the end of his spine, and the doctor determined that a tail would grow there, and he was very likely to become an ape-monkey. Unfortunately, this Becker died soon; he did not live to see a "fresh and alive" ape-monkey come to create the new law that "ape-monkeys evolved from humans".

It is not uncommon for newborn babies to have strange shapes. In the twenty-third year of the Republic of China, a boy was born in the Shao family in Yingzhou, Anhui. His body was covered with golden hair, the color was bright, and the buttocks were especially abundant. Just in July this year, a woman in Nagano Prefecture, Japan, gave birth to a girl with two faces, four arms, and four legs, completely connected together above the buttocks. (According to the Changchun Xinsheng Daily on August 30, a woman also gave birth to such a freak.

Double Brain

Australia has a young man named Wilkinson who was born with a "double brain." He can write letters, draw pictures, or write essays with both his left and right hands at the same time, the contents are completely different, and he can think about two different questions at the same time without confusion. Local companies and agencies are vying to hire him, because one person can do the work of two people.

From the "Gazelle People", I quickly wrote about some special phenomena of human beings. These special phenomena all need to be studied in detail by general scientists.

### Announcement of Winning Couplets

— You Tai

Editor's note: A British reporter said that the Hong Kong issue is like "a wave in a teacup," and we can't help but feel it; so we asked readers to reply to it with a second line. Many readers responded, and here are the most obvious and profound ones. As for whether the couplets themselves are precise or whether the tones are correct, it is not important, the main thing is to take their meaning.

(1) "The snoring beside the bed" (unbearable) — Zhong Qiu

(2) "The bacteria on rotten feet" (Hong Kong feet, be careful of spreading!) — Wu Guangxiang

(3) "The embers in the opium pipe" (please check history) — Qi Shi

(4) "The white worms on the top hat" (referring to the top hats of gentlemen) — Wen

The rest will not be listed one by one, and we can only let it be "a pearl left in the sea!" — Editorial Office

### "Teachers" You Tai

The so-called "teachers" are like this:

Elementary school teaches "death" (teachers),

Middle school teaches "resentment" (teaching staff),

University teaches "sorrow" (professors).

### From the Death of the Tank Inventor, Discussing the Birth of the Tank

— Jin Xia

According to a London dispatch, Sir Tritton, the inventor of the tank (knighted by the British royal family for his meritorious invention), passed away at his home in Lincoln on the 24th of this month, at the age of seventy-one. Counting back, he was exactly forty years old when he invented the tank. Regarding his personal "achievement," we are not in a position to say anything; because what he invented was a tool of war. Here, we only introduce to readers some stories about the birth of the tank, which is very interesting common knowledge.

Far back in the 15th century, during the Renaissance in Europe, there was an artist, Leonardo da Vinci, who wrote in a text his fantasy: "I am working on designing a war chariot fully clad in iron armor, sturdy and impenetrable; when driving it, firing guns and cannons to charge into the enemy ranks, no matter how powerful the enemy army, they will have to collapse, and the infantry behind it can safely advance straight in." At the time, in Leonardo's mind, it was only the fantasy of a scholar, but unexpectedly, he became a most accurate prophet: he uttered the functional structure of the greatest weapon on land, born more than four hundred and thirty years later.

Madman's Rant

From 1911 to 1914, several engineers in England submitted plans of something similar to a tank to the War Office; currently, these documents are still stored in the files of the British War Office, with the annotation "This is a madman's rant!" added on top.

When the First European War broke out, the Allied forces and the German army were locked in a stalemate on the banks of the Somme River in France. Although the battle line extended west to the North Sea, the German defenses were solid, and the Allied forces could not break through. At that time, Colonel Swinton was assigned to the French General Headquarters as an observer. He believed that to break the deadlock of trench warfare, it was necessary to use a war chariot that could not be deterred by bullets, could cross trenches, and was equipped with quick-firing guns; he returned to China in October 1914 and presented this idea to the General Headquarters. This proposal was seen by Churchill, then the Minister of the Navy, who gave it special support. The following year, the British Ministry of War and the Admiralty jointly formed a joint committee to conduct research. On September 19, a model exhibition was held in Lincoln. The design of the model made by the committee was not exactly the same as the original. Swinton thought it was a failure; later, the wooden model designed specifically by Tritton and his assistant Captain Wilson was tested, and it fully met the actual conditions: (1) it could climb over obstacles five feet high, (2) it could cross trenches eight feet wide. Therefore, the British authorities decided to build according to that model.

Secret Test

In the summer of 1916, this new weapon was secretly tested in the UK. On the morning of September 15 of the same year, it was used in combat in the Somme region of France. When the German army saw this huge monster for the first time, they were shocked and retreated in defeat.

As for the origin of the name "tank," it was because the British authorities, in order to avoid attracting attention, put the completed new weapon in a box and sealed it, with "Tank" (meaning "water tank") marked on the outside, so as not to arouse suspicion.

The German army originally did not have tanks, but in May 1917, they had successfully copied them and confronted the Allied forces.

Early tanks had many shortcomings. Military experts criticized them, saying that tanks had three diseases: "lame, mute, blind." Because at that time, the tank's speed was only three or four miles per hour, there was no communication, and the observation holes were narrow. However, when it appeared in the Second World War, its power greatly increased, becoming the king of the land, with a speed increased to thirty miles per hour, wireless communication and command, and various types: amphibious, flamethrower, light, medium, heavy tanks, etc.

Although we have now reached the atomic age, tanks are still important weapons in land warfare.

News Figures

### Veteran Anti-Japanese General Ma Zhanshan

— Chong Zhen

General Ma Zhanshan is China's first anti-Japanese general. As early as 1934, he stood on the icy and snowy banks of the Nenjiang Bridge, boldly firing the first bullet of "resistance" at the Japanese invaders. This old general, now sixty-two years old, has never left the anti-Japanese post from that time until now. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, he sat in Halahai, in the cracks between Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Sui provinces, struggling with the stubborn Japanese invaders; however, in recent years, he seemed to be buried in the wind and sand. Many people cared about him, and many people forgot about him. A few days ago, the newspaper suddenly revealed his new appointment. Now, he is the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Security.

Grew up in a Farmer's Family

Looking back to his birth: it was in 1885 in the home of a farmer in Huai District, Liaoning Province. When he was young, he liked to practice martial arts and was full of heroic thoughts. At the age of thirteen, he could shoot with both hands, hitting the target nine out of ten times, and was also proficient in horsemanship. This was also the environment that cultivated him into such a martial figure. He was extremely filial to his mother, day after day for decades. If his mother was sick, he would personally take care of her. He was sincere and frank in making friends. If others were in trouble, he would do his best to help them, especially if strangers asked him for help, he would be even more generous. Therefore, although the general has held important positions for decades, he is still very poor.

In his decades of military career, he has always adhered to the spirit of Jiang Taigong guarding the law and avenging grievances, engaging in arduous anti-Japanese work. During the War of Resistance, people often had a legendary myth about him, saying that he had disappeared, and saying that he was in battle. In fact, he was always just like that.

When the Lugou Bridge Incident broke out, he immediately went to Nanjing to ask for instructions and met with Chairman Chiang. At that time, he was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Advance Army. In mid-October of that year, his troops participated in the virgin battle to defend Gui Sui in a semi-mature state. He tried his best to serve the country. Later, although he was forced to retreat, he himself was the last one to withdraw. He took the last train to leave Gui Sui. Subsequently, in the enemy's winter mopping-up campaign, he led his troops to fight hard in the north and south, establishing extraordinary achievements. In 1939, he also wanted to lead his troops to the east to fight back to Heilongjiang. Under extremely difficult circumstances, he rushed to the western border of Rehe, but in the smooth progress, he encountered complex environmental encirclements and attacks everywhere. He seemed to be bound. During the "February 3rd" Yimeng Incident in 1943, he quietly guarded an empty city, and finally did not allow the enemy to succeed, but turned danger into safety, protecting that great city.

Great Ambition and Aspiration

He often thought to himself: "I can lead brave soldiers across the Chahar steppe and directly attack Heilongjiang, igniting every corner!" However, this ideal did not become a reality, and his great ambition and aspiration could only lurk deep in his heart, waiting for that day to fight back to the Northeast. Finally, the War of Resistance was won, and General Ma looked towards the Northeast with a smile, but the Northeast was again subjected to international "robbery" and the internal conflict ignited by a third party. This disappointed General Ma too much!

After the victory, he was willing to hand over the fourteen guerrilla teams into two divisions (20,000 people) to the country. Because he himself was old and should retire, letting the younger generation and up-and-coming military officers take on new tasks. But the current situation prevents him from retiring.

Although General Ma is an old general in his sixties, he is still constantly learning. He always reads a lot of books every day, especially the most important news in the newspapers. He likes to talk, his mouth surpasses his pen. When he is talking vigorously, he will light a cigarette, which is his most energetic shot.

Today, he has been transferred to the post of Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Security. When the people of the Northeast saw this old general return to the Northeast, it was like an old village elder returning to his hometown after many years. Their hearts are pure. I believe that all compatriots in China must also be concerned about this old general.

From the Northeast issue, I thought of General Ma Zhanshan, and from General Ma Zhanshan, I thought of this battered Oriental Balkans, which is full of emotion!
