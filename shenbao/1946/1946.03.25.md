### Investigation by Military Commission and Statistics Bureau Confirms Death of General Dai Li: Plane Crashed into Ma'anshan Mountain in Nanjing

[Special Dispatch from Ta Kung Pao] Regarding the news of the death of General Dai Li of the Military Commission's Investigation and Statistics Bureau in a plane crash, since this newspaper first revealed it on the 22nd, rumors have been rampant in the city, with no consensus. According to the results of investigations by this newspaper's reporters from various sources, it is confirmed that General Dai's plane, en route from Beiping via Qingdao to Shanghai on the 17th, crashed into the summit of Ma'anshan Mountain in Banqiao Town, southwest of Nanjing, resulting in his death. Dai's body was also identified in the burned wreckage of the plane and was placed in a coffin in Nanjing on the 22nd. The following is a comprehensive report from this newspaper's special correspondent in Nanjing and detailed information obtained from relevant sources in this city:

On the morning of the 17th, General Dai Li departed from Beiping on Aviation Commission plane number 222, bound for Shanghai. A telegram had been sent to the Shanghai Military Statistics Bureau office beforehand, stating that he would arrive in Shanghai on the afternoon of the 17th and planned to preside over the memorial week at the Shanghai office on the 18th. The plane was piloted by two American pilots. Also on board were seven staff members of the Military Statistics Bureau, including Xu Xuanfang, Director of Personnel, a deputy, two translators, and two guards. In addition, there were twenty-three officers and generals from our military organs.

The plane landed in Qingdao at noon to allow the passengers to have lunch. After continuing its flight, it sent out two telegrams. Later, due to a leaking fuel tank, radio communication was lost with the ground.

When the plane left Qingdao, the pilot mentioned that the weather report was very bad at the time. If they were unable to land in Shanghai, they planned to land in Nanjing. If they still could not land in Nanjing, they were prepared to return to Qingdao. Therefore, the amount of gasoline carried was very large, for use in hovering and flying around in various places in bad weather. The speed of the fire and its intensity after the plane crashed into the mountain summit were also likely due to the excessive amount of gasoline stored.

Flying Low to Choose a Location, Crash into Mountain Summit Ignites Gasoline

A few hours after the plane departed, it encountered strong winds and heavy rain. According to investigations, the plane circled near the suburbs of Shanghai in an attempt to land, but due to poor visibility on the airfield ground, it turned towards Nanjing, intending to land at Ming Palace Airport. However, while circling near Nanjing, dense fog made visibility poor, so it flew low to select a landing spot. Unexpectedly, it crashed into the mountain summit, and the gasoline inside the plane ignited, causing an unprecedented plane crash disaster in recent years. According to the investigation by this newspaper's special correspondent in Nanjing, there were three impact marks on the summit where the plane crashed. The plane's door was pressed against the ground after the crash. Judging from the situation, even if there were survivors among the passengers at the time, they were unable to open the door and escape in the brief moment before the gasoline exploded. According to nearby villagers, they heard miserable screams at the time, but they dared not approach to rescue them because of the exploding bullets inside the plane. After losing radio contact with the plane, personnel at the Shanghai and Nanjing airports immediately telegraphed the Aviation Commission to report the incident. Four special planes were dispatched on the afternoon of the 17th to search. The U.S. Air Force Command and our Air Force units ventured out despite the bad weather to conduct reconnaissance. On the 18th, eight more planes were dispatched to participate in the reconnaissance, but due to the dense fog and poor visibility, the burned wreckage of the plane was not discovered until the 19th on the slopes of Ma'anshan Mountain in Banqiao Town, southwest of Nanjing.

Shanghai Office Receives News, Personnel Rush to Investigate On-Site

Upon hearing the news, personnel from the Shanghai Military Statistics Bureau office rushed to Nanjing to conduct an on-site investigation. Li Chongshi, Chief of Staff of the Military Statistics Bureau, also personally led personnel to investigate. However, due to the intense fire, the bodies of the passengers were almost impossible to identify. However, the first items discovered were the personal seals of Xu Xuanfang, Director of Personnel of the Military Statistics Bureau, and a guard. Later, Dai's personal self-defense pistol and luggage key were also found, proving beyond a doubt that Dai was a passenger on the plane. Investigators also found gold teeth fillings resembling Dai's in the charred remains, further confirming that Dai was killed in the plane. Dai usually wore American-made wool sweaters. Investigators found a similar sweater on the back of one body, and based on this, they identified the corpse as Dai's remains. The skull of the corpse was fractured, and one hand was also destroyed. Among the remaining twenty passengers, only the bodies of Xu Xuanfang, Director of Personnel of the Military Statistics Bureau, two translators, one adjutant, and two soldiers were identifiable. The bodies of the remaining personnel were all burned. The Military Statistics Bureau recovered eight bodies and seven pistols from the crash site.

Placed in Coffin on the 22nd, Friends Deeply Mourn

After the unmistakable identification of Dai's body, it was moved to the Military Statistics Bureau office on Yixian Bridge, Zhongshan East Road, Nanjing, on the 22nd to be placed in a coffin. Silk floss was used to fill in the upper and lower parts to make a complete body, a ceremonial hat was placed on the head, and a silk quilt was placed over the body before it was placed in the coffin. Staff members from the Bureau's offices in Nanjing and Shanghai wept loudly at the time, and Dai's friends deeply mourned. After the news of General Dai's death reached Chongqing, it was reported that the authorities were discussing the selection of a successor.

General Dai, named Yu Chen, was fifty years old and a native of Jiangshan, Zhejiang. He was a graduate of Wenxi Elementary School, Hangzhou First Middle School, and the sixth class of the Whampoa Military Academy. In the 16th and 17th years of the Republic, he served as a staff officer under Hu Zongnan, stationed in Xuzhou, Jiangsu. In the 22nd year of the Republic, he succeeded Deng Weny in Nanchang as the Director of the Investigation Section of the Military Commission. Later, the section was reorganized into a bureau, and he was promoted to Director. His wife, née Mao, was also from Jiangshan and died of illness in Shanghai during the War of Resistance. He never remarried. His mother, née Lan, is seventy-one years old and still alive. Dai came from a prominent family with modest means. His son, Zangyi, is twenty-six years old and runs the Jianguo Middle School in Jiangshan. During the Xi'an Incident, Dai accompanied Madame Chiang Kai-shek and T.V. Soong to Xi'an. Dai was extremely strong-willed, with keen and insightful views, and acted with魄力. For more than ten years, he endured hardship and was very frugal.

### National Army Penetrates Deep into Northeast Plains, Clearing Liaodong Peninsula, Red Star Newspaper Says Soviet Army is Accelerating Withdrawal

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Changchun on the 23rd] Today, six more planes transported another group of receiving personnel. Although rumors are rampant in the city, most people are quietly observing the changes, standing in the Mantetsu Building or walking the streets, feeling a new feeling, but certainly not an unpleasant one.

[United Press, Shenyang, 24th] The National Army Headquarters received news today that the New Sixth Army has reached Anshan, fifty miles south of Shenyang. Another unit of the National Army entered Liaoyang yesterday afternoon. They are waiting for reinforcements to arrive before continuing south. It is apparent that the 共军 in the area have retreated. It is rumored that a considerable number of 共正 are concentrated in the area, equipped with Japanese weapons. Furthermore, the National Army, starting from Xinmin, advanced in two routes, southeast and northeast, towards Panshan and Yingkou, which are occupied by the 共军. Once they occupy Yingkou, the National Army reinforcements can land at that port. Judging from the current situation, the National Army is currently making every effort to clear the entire Liaodong Peninsula. The situation in Changchun is still chaotic. According to fragmented news received in Shenyang, the Soviet army has withdrawn from the city without notifying the Chinese authorities beforehand. Telephone, telegraph, and railway traffic between Changchun and Shenyang remain blocked. The last two planes from Changchun yesterday carried forty high-ranking Chinese officials. Four hundred lower-ranking officials remain in the city.

[United Press, Chongqing, 24th] According to news from Shenyang: The National Army entered Fushun on the 20th, assigning troops to be stationed there permanently. A unit of the 52nd Army is advancing near Liaoyang, and a unit of the New First Army entered Tieling on the 21st. After the Soviet army withdrew from Sipingjie, the 共军 took the opportunity to occupy it. There is currently intense fighting there.

[United Press, Shenyang, 22nd] (Delayed) The New First Army is still advancing on foot. The reporter, at a place more than twenty li outside the ancient city of Shenyang, watched these brave soldiers who had fought in the India-Burma theater, carrying automatic rifles and rifles, wearing U.S. military leather clothing, steel helmets, and high-heeled Arctic leather boots, marching in long columns on muddy and rutted roads. Cold and sudden raindrops hit their faces, indicating the arrival of spring in the Northeast. These soldiers, trained by Stilwell into a formidable force, are led by General Sun Liren, a graduate of the U.S. West Point Military Academy. They have just emerged from the malaria-infested tropical forests and arrived in the bitterly cold north. Now they are penetrating deep into the Northeast plains, heading towards Sipingjie, three hundred li away.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 24th] The number of Soviet troops here has significantly decreased. The withdrawal work in the last day or two seems to be slowing down, no longer as hurried as in the previous few days, and the atmosphere of uneasiness has also slightly eased. Some observers believe that the number of Soviet troops who have already withdrawn from Changchun may be greater than those who have not yet withdrawn. They believe that once the Soviet command issues the order for the final withdrawal, it can be completed in one or two days, or even within a few hours.

[French Press Agency, Moscow, 23rd] Officials recently announced that the Soviet army has not only withdrawn from Shenyang but also from neighboring areas, and the number of withdrawals has gradually increased.

[United Press, Moscow, 23rd] The Soviet army's official newspaper, "Red Star," reported today that the weather in Manchuria is warming up, and the Soviet army is accelerating its withdrawal. The reason the Soviet army initially failed to withdraw was due to two requests from the Chinese government, and later due to severe cold weather, which made marching difficult. The Soviet troops in Shenyang and Fushun have completely withdrawn.

### Soviets No Longer Object to Using China Changchun Railway to Transport National Army

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 23rd] Regarding the transport of the National Army to Changchun for handover via railway, the Soviet side no longer objects and is currently discussing technical issues. When our military delegation formally presented a note to the Soviet side on this matter, the Soviet side, although expressing agreement in principle in its reply, concluded that it was "difficult to comply." After Liu Zhe, director of the China Changchun Railway, earnestly discussed the matter with Karger, the Soviet deputy director of the railway, Karger initially strongly opposed it, but soon expressed his agreement. Karger stated that there were not many vehicles on the railway and that it might be necessary to use some vehicles from the Beining Railway in the future. It is generally believed that there are no problems in principle or in theory with using the China Changchun Railway to transport the National Army. The so-called technical issues include the deployment of employees, the allocation of vehicles, and the repair of damaged sections of the railway. It is believed that if the Soviet side can provide us with some convenience in these areas, the process will be very smooth. Liu Zhe and Karger held their initial talks on the 21st. On the same day, they also sincerely exchanged views on the issue of selecting employees for the China Changchun Railway. As a result, they agreed that both parties would jointly issue employee identification cards to protect their safety. Liu, in his capacity as a member of the National Government and director of the China Changchun Railway, issued a notice to the Chinese and Soviet employees of the railway. The wording of the document had been agreed upon by Karger. The document stated: "My dearest Chinese and Soviet employees of the China Changchun Railway, as the Soviet troops withdraw and the Chinese troops take over, your ability to stand at your posts and fulfill your responsibilities is what I admire most." According to Liu, recently, the employees of the China Changchun Railway felt panicked due to the unsettled situation, but after reaching an agreement with the Soviet side on stabilization measures, the situation has stabilized. Liu also stated that, as of now, all employees of the board of directors are working as usual, except for two who left without resigning due to their relationship with the Economic Committee. Liu instructed the reporter to convey to the readers within the pass that the Chinese employees of the China Changchun Railway have "stood firm."

### Exchange of Ratification Instruments for China-Mexico Friendship Treaty

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th] The ratification instruments for the China-Mexico Friendship Treaty were exchanged at the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs on February 26 of this year. According to Article 10 of the treaty, it will take effect from the date of the exchange of ratification instruments.

### Life of Traitorous Officials Imprisoned in Nanjing, Emperor Chen Died of Illness Last Week

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Nanjing, 24th] Chen Quan, the puppet Nanjing Gendarmerie Commander, who was arrested in Nanjing in the first batch of traitors last September 28, died of illness in prison last week. It is reported that Chen was addicted to opium in the past and repented incessantly before his death. After the news of Chen's death spread, Hu Yukun, who had served in the puppet army, and Li Ou, who had served in the puppet police, panicked greatly. They were relieved only after learning that Chen had died of illness. The imprisoned traitors are living their lives in prison in various ways. Li Shengwu spends his days searching for books and newspapers, drawing, and writing. Chen Junhui eats and sleeps all day, pretending to be calm. Lin Bosheng, whenever he has the opportunity, relapses into his old habits, bragging at will, but the guards ignore him. Pu Dong, also known as the Red Bean Hall Master, claims that he is a famous amateur opera singer in Beiping who has fallen into a Nanjing cesspool, a true "falling into a pit." With nothing to do in prison, he sings loudly, his enthusiasm still intact, but it is unknown when he will sing "Being Escorted."

### Marshall Requests U.S. Loan to Aid China for Large-Scale Industrial Development, U.S. Department of Agriculture Proposes Recommendations for Reviving Our Agriculture

[French Press Agency, New York, 23rd] Marshal George C. Marshall, President Truman's special envoy to China, today requested the U.S. National Advisory Council for an additional $560 million in loans to China. Regarding this matter, the Chinese government has already submitted a request for the Export-Import Bank to consider. Well-informed sources here believe that Marshal Marshall intends for the Chinese government to quickly obtain this loan to ensure political stability and to rely on it for large-scale industrial development. However, this issue seems to be better handled by the newly established Reconstruction Bank. The reason the Export-Import Bank has been slow to study the Chinese government's request is likely due to this.

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 23rd] The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Foreign Agricultural Relations Office released a report on the 22nd, proposing several recommendations for reviving rural areas in China and Korea to compensate for the enormous losses suffered during the war against Japan. The report pointed out that about half of China's rural areas have been destroyed by war and suggested a broad agricultural expansion plan to meet China's specific needs. The report strongly urged assistance to Chinese farmers in adopting modern methods and improving general health and hygiene conditions.

[U.S. Information Service, Boston, 23rd] According to a recent report in the Christian Science Monitor: Lu Guangmian, one of the leaders of the Chinese cooperative movement, and his wife have been visiting cooperative stores in New England for a week. Lu stated that he hopes to use the experiences he gained in the U.S. to expand cooperative enterprises after returning to China. He plans to visit England, Scotland, Denmark, Sweden, the United States, and other places on this world tour. The purpose of this trip is fourfold: (1) To discuss ways to exchange products with other countries that promote cooperative enterprises. (2) To exchange cooperative technologies in order to increase production and improve the quality of goods. (3) To promote the cooperative movement to assist ordinary people in improving their economic standing. (4) To communicate news about people and their public economic problems in various places in order to help maintain international peace.

### Madame Chiang Arrives in Shanghai from Chongqing, Chen Bulei Accompanies Her for Short Rest

[This Newspaper Report] Madame Chiang, accompanied by Central Committee member Chen Bulei and his wife, arrived at Longhua Airport at 4:10 PM yesterday on the special plane "Meiling." Also accompanying them was Ms. Kong Lingwei, the daughter of former Executive Yuan Vice President Kong Xiangxi. Central Committee member Chen Bulei has been suffering from fatigue and insomnia for the past two months, so he came to Shanghai for a short rest. Those who greeted them at Longhua Airport included Mayor Qian, Dong XianGuang, Huang Renlin, Chen Xunyu, Zhan Wenhu, Shi Yonggeng, and dozens of relatives and friends. At 4:00 PM, the 210 "Minjiang" plane carrying Madame's entourage landed at the airport first. At 4:10 PM, "Meiling No. 1" slowly landed. Madame Chiang, full of energy, stepped off the plane first with a smile, nodding to each of the greeters. Chen Bulei and his wife followed suit. Chen looked thinner than a few years ago, a testament to his hard work for the country over the past eight years. When reporters asked about his feelings on this trip to Shanghai, Chen replied: "I have lived in Shanghai the longest, and Shanghai is no different from my second hometown to me. It has been a full nine years since I left Shanghai in March of the 26th year of the Republic. This trip to Shanghai is like a traveler returning home. I am very grateful for the friendly struggle of Shanghai during the difficult times of the War of Resistance." Chen also said that he plans to visit Hangzhou in the near future to adjust to the tense life of the past years. After getting off the plane, Chen and his wife returned to their residence with his younger brother, Chen Liannian. After getting off the plane, Madame Chiang returned to her residence on Garth Road with Dong Xianguang and Ms. Kong Lingwei. Mayor Qian also went by car to pay his respects, leaving with Dong after a few minutes. After resting for a while, Madame Chiang visited Kong Xiangxi, who had arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. It is reported that Madame's purpose in coming to Shanghai this time, in addition to visiting Endner, may be to go to Nanjing to arrange matters for returning to the capital.

[This Newspaper Report, Guangzhou, 23rd] Madame Chiang will come here in the next few days, and Chairman Chiang plans to visit Guangdong in April.

### Yesterday's People's Political Council Passed a Resolution Requesting the Government to Relieve the Food Shortage, Councilors Expose Corruption, Listeners Moved

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th] The People's Political Council held its seventh meeting at 8:30 AM on the 24th. 144 councilors attended, with Jiangxi as chairman. Agriculture and Forestry Minister Zhou Yichun and Judicial Administration Minister Xie Guansheng gave reports on agriculture and forestry and judicial administration, respectively, completing them in two hours. More than 40 councilors, including Wang Guanying, proposed a motion requesting the government to quickly relieve the food shortage in various parts of the country, suggesting that the government adopt three relief measures, such as "exempting disaster-stricken provinces from purchasing military grain." It was passed by a vote. Subsequently, councilors raised written and oral questions regarding agriculture and forestry and judicial administration. One of the most heated questions regarding agriculture and forestry was about why Ling Xuan, an official of the ministry, committed suicide after being dismissed and the bribery and illegal sales of dairy cows and other malfeasance by Qian Tianhe, vice minister of the ministry, and his subordinate Zhang Binzhen during the takeover of enemy and puppet Shanghai farms, requesting the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to investigate and deal with them severely. Regarding judicial administration, several councilors raised questions about the slowness of punishing traitorous officials, the low salaries of judges, the need to increase their salaries in order to implement the rule of law and eliminate corruption in accordance with the principle of "adequate salaries to foster integrity," and the shortage of judges. The oral questioning was still not completed at 12:00 noon. The chairman announced that it would continue in the afternoon session. The spirit of the councilors hating evil like an enemy and exposing corruption was fully demonstrated during the questioning at today's meeting, moving the listeners. The eighth meeting was held at 3:20 PM, with Social Affairs Minister Gu Weiji attending to give a social report. Wang Yunwu presided over the meeting, with 154 councilors in attendance. Councilor Zhou Binglin attended for the first time. Gu's report was divided into four points: (1) Relief for unemployed workers and handling of labor-management disputes. (2) Development and enrichment of professional organizations. (3) Implementation of social relief work. (4) Development of cooperative enterprises, lasting for one hour. Due to time constraints, the number of questions raised by the councilors was very small, only He Chunfan, Wu Yunchu, Xue Mingjian, Zhang Shouyue, Li Jianzhi, and Wu Wangji inquired about the China Labor Association having received $600,000 in donations from American workers, but the association did not use the funds for the welfare of workers, but as capital for political activities, which should be investigated, and the problems after the takeover of factories. The Federation of Industry and Commerce should strengthen its organization and determine wage standards to prevent labor unrest. Finally, Minister Gu replied, stating briefly: "Labor discipline takes the national interest as its premise and will strive to maintain it." There are factual difficulties in improving agricultural professional organizations and cooperative institutions. Adjusting wage standards varies from place to place, but the general principle is to take into account both the livelihood of workers and the welfare of industry. Gu also stated: "The Labor Association is a cultural organization, not a statutory workers' organization. It is true that American workers donated to the association. The association has now made personnel adjustments to ensure that the association truly becomes an institution for research and culture."

### Harbin's Atmosphere Eases; Li Zhaolin Case Culprit Under Interrogation

[Our Newspaper, Harbin, 24th] Recent rumors spread widely that a large force of Li Zhaolin's Anti-Japanese Army had entered Harbin, indeed approaching the city limits, creating an extremely tense situation. The Harbin branch of the Central Bank was also ordered to withdraw. Mayor Yang Chuo'an calmly handled the situation, and the Soviet army expressed full responsibility for security. Li Zhaolin's remains were buried at Daoli Park on the 24th. Li's forces did not enter the city; only representatives were sent to participate in the funeral procession, and the atmosphere began to ease slightly. The main culprit in Li's case has now been apprehended by the police bureau and is undergoing strict interrogation. There are no signs of withdrawal yet from the Soviet troops in northern Manchuria. The public eagerly anticipates the arrival of the National Army. The weather in Harbin is mild. The eight members of the municipal government and various departments receiving personnel are continuing to work as usual.

[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 23rd] Li Zhaolin, president of the Harbin-Soviet Friendship Association, was assassinated on the 9th. Memorial services were held in both Changchun and Harbin on the 24th.

Judging from news from the Northeast, there has not yet been a major conflict between the regional government and the Communist armies.

[Associated Press, Beiping, 24th] Authoritative sources here reported today that several teams of the executive group will travel to the Northeast in the coming days on airplanes piloted by American pilots.

### Security Council Meeting Opens Today; Soviet Union Takes Unexpected Action; Proposes Suggestions to Expand Veto Power; Iranian Prime Minister Denies Direct Negotiations with Soviet Union

[Our Newspaper] London, 24th Radio: Twenty-four hours before the Security Council meeting, the Soviet Union suddenly took an unexpected action. The Soviet side has submitted suggestions regarding procedural rules to the Drafting Committee. These suggestions would, in effect, give the Soviet Union the right to veto any country listing the Iranian issue as a "dispute." It is heard that the representatives of the United Kingdom and the United States will oppose these suggestions.

[Central News Agency, New York, 23rd, Associated Press] According to authoritative sources: The Soviet Union is attempting to expand the application of veto power in the United Nations Security Council. The Soviet Union suggests that even if the five major powers are parties to a dispute, they can also veto any resolution of the Council. In addition, the Soviet Union also suggests that any country, whether or not it is a member of the Security Council, should have the right to propose motions in the Security Council if it is a party to a dispute. It is learned that permanent procedural rules are currently being discussed, but there is no preparation to submit a report to the upcoming Security Council.

[Our Newspaper] London, 24th Radio: The Iranian Prime Minister made an important speech today, denying that the Iranian side had conducted direct negotiations with the Soviet Union on the issue of the Soviet army's withdrawal from Iran. It is said that his negotiations in Moscow yielded no results, and there have been no new developments since his return to Iran, nor has he discussed this issue with anyone. The Iranian Prime Minister admitted that he had met with the new Soviet Ambassador to Iran twice, but said that he only introduced the new ambassador to the Iranian King in his capacity as Foreign Minister so that the Soviet ambassador could present his credentials. The Iranian Prime Minister also denied that he had submitted his resignation.

[Our Newspaper] London, 24th Radio: The Security Council will be held tomorrow. Iran's protest against the Soviet army's continued stay in northern Iran will be an international issue that must be discussed. It is believed that the relationship of the Iranian issue is not limited to the independence of that country, but contains extremely important significance. In Iran, newspapers and people attach importance to whether the Security Council can smoothly handle this incident. Washington admits that the purpose of the Soviet Union's actions in Iran is to ensure the Soviet Union's security, but in order to achieve this security, the Soviet Union is actively attempting to dominate Middle Eastern countries and weaken British and American influence. This point is no longer concealed in diplomatic circles.

[United Press, New York, 23rd] When the Security Council holds a meeting, Iran's accusation against the Soviet Union is currently listed as the third item on the agenda. However, according to Secretary-General Lai Yi, after the meeting, the agenda can be rearranged according to the American proposal, and the case will be immediately submitted for discussion.

[Reuters, New York, 24th] During the United Nations Security Council meeting, the chiefs of staff of the five major powers of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, China, and France will study secret memoranda as the basis for United Nations military action. The discussion will be conducted in wartime secrecy.

[Central News Agency, New York, 23rd, Special Dispatch] The Soviet representative Sobulev, Assistant Secretary-General of the United Nations in charge of handling Security Council affairs, said that the Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Gromyko, has been appointed as a permanent member of the Security Council and has arrived in New York from Washington. The Soviet Union nominated Gromyko as the chairman of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, while the Netherlands nominated Security Council permanent member Kleffens as the representative.

### Truman Delivers Speech; Strengthen the Foundation of the United Nations; Never Retreat Because Peace Encounters Danger; World Trade Must Be Restored

[United Press, Washington, 23rd] President Truman delivered a speech at the Jackson Memorial Day dinner today, saying, "The United States must lead towards a more perfect world order. We want to increase close friendship with all countries and will strengthen the foundation of the United Nations. We will never retreat because peace and progress encounter danger on the way, and we will achieve our goals regardless of all difficulties and create a prosperous and peaceful world. The world we need is one where all countries can trade with each other and with us. This means that other countries also have the opportunity to rebuild their war-torn countries and can also cooperate with the United States to maintain orderly transactions and exchange of goods. We have made great progress in this. Just a few days ago, the International Bank and the International Monetary Fund were established in Savannah, Georgia, according to the Bretton Woods Agreement. Therefore, President Jackson led social and political reforms and fought against reactionary forces, and his achievements are well known. Following this, there is another advocate of social justice who has revived these principles. This is the late President Roosevelt. If this great savior of the world were still with us today, he would happily inspire our courage and faith and lead us to strive to improve the fate of mankind everywhere. He would shout: Continue to struggle! The complete interruption of economic life has never been greater than that of our economic relations. During the war, most of the foreign trade was managed by the government and for the government. This must also be changed. World trade must be restored and must be restored to private enterprises." Truman's speech mostly involved domestic issues, calling on the Democratic Party to unite and take responsibility. America's leadership position in the world is due to the Democratic Party's "enlightened internationalism."

Vandenberg Doubts Soviet Intentions

[United Press, Grand Rapids, Michigan, 23rd] Senator Vandenberg declared tonight: If the United States and the Soviet Union each choose their own path, the United Nations organization is unlikely to survive in its current form. If Washington and Moscow guide their foreign policies with common sense and realism, there is no need for war between the Soviet Union and the United States. Although the progress of the United Nations structure so far is deeply exciting, the solution to the biggest mystery of modern times remains elusive. The so-called biggest mystery of modern times is what the Soviet Union's true intentions are now.

[Associated Press, Grand Ledge, Michigan, 24th] US Senator Vandenberg demanded today that free elections be held in Poland, which has now become a Soviet satellite country. Otherwise, the United States should present this fact to the United Nations organization and demand a public trial.

Editorial

### Spring Arrives in Jiangnan

"Apricot blossoms, spring rain in Jiangnan," this conjures up so much painting-like and poetic Jiangnan springtime scenery. People living in the city rarely have the opportunity to see apricot blossoms, but the spring rain in Jiangnan is always something that can be experienced; especially in the past month, the entire Jiangnan region has been immersed in the spring rain. The sound of trickling rain has accompanied the people of Jiangnan for a month. After a long period of rain, having deeply tasted the flavor of Jiangnan's spring rain, it is lovely to see the delicate spring sunshine. This is the first spring after the victory of the War of Resistance, and it should be joyful and exciting; however, looking at the current situation, one cannot help but feel somewhat heavy amid the joy and excitement. The news seen when opening the newspaper includes problems lurking within the United Nations organization, the Iranian issue, our Northeast problem, and also a constant stream of records as annoying as the spring. Regarding the United Nations organization, we see the following report: "The second session of the Security Council, which is under public scrutiny, is only three days away. British representative Cadogan and Stetinius are strengthening diplomatic warfare. They have been constantly consulting with representatives of various countries over the past two days, hoping to use a majority vote to reject the Soviet Union's proposal to postpone the meeting when discussing the first item on the agenda." Regarding Iran, it says: "Iran is tense while celebrating the New Year. Tehran is threatened by a coup. It is said that the leftist Democratic Party is planning to overthrow the government." Regarding the Northeast, according to a report from Changchun on the 22nd, the receiving personnel were evacuated from Weichun to Jinzhou by eight aircraft; another report stated that in the plain area between Liaoyang and Yingkou, nearly 100,000 unidentified armed troops have gathered in the past week. The leaders and their cadres mostly speak with Shandong and northern Jiangsu accents, and the weapons used are mostly Japanese-made, with many heavy artillery pieces attached.

However, what is thought-provoking is another piece of news that does not receive much attention; it reads as follows: "According to the person in charge of the Postal Administration, the 'Transportation Bureau' of the Communist Party suddenly sent personnel to 'take over' the areas of Qilin Town, Sanyang Town, Beixin Town, Jiulong Town, and the Qidong area under the jurisdiction of the postal district in this city at the beginning of last month, dispersing all the postal workers and issuing Mao Zedong stamps. Now the postal route between this city and that area has been interrupted. This happened within the postal district of Shanghai, and these places are only twenty or thirty miles away from the center of Shanghai." "Apricot blossoms, spring rain in Jiangnan," people in the city do not often see apricot blossoms, but apricot blossoms are sometimes cultivated in private courtyards within the city. Only twenty or thirty miles away from the decadent and extravagant Shanghai, what kind of situation is happening and developing?

Nantong, which faces Shanghai across the Yangtze River, according to a letter from a reader in Nantong to our newspaper, says: "Since the Japanese invaders surrendered, the people of Nantong naively thought they could live a happy life, but the opposite is true; the communist troops in the surrounding countryside are watching intently, and there is a possibility of being swallowed up at any time, so people are living in fear, especially the people in the countryside. After the National Army occupied the county seat, they exempted one year's land tax, but the New Fourth Army in the countryside forcibly levied public grain, and the amount levied was many times more than the exempted land tax. Almost all the rice and grain earned by tenant farmers was taken away by the New Fourth Army; they also issued 'Resistance Currency', using this worthless piece of paper to exchange for a large amount of cotton and cloth; then they sent people to transport the cotton and cloth to Nantong or Shanghai to buy bicycles and other military supplies. Thus, the materials that the common people worked hard for a year were all turned into 'Resistance Currency' printed with Mao Zedong's image... The political consultations above have no impact on them, but instead have intensified, prohibiting students from going out to study... The only authoritative news for the communist troops near Nantong is the 'Jianghuai Guide', which previously stated: 'On × month × day, the Nationalist troops ×× people, invaded Shigang, and were repelled by our defending troops. They fought fiercely in Yujiawei for a day and night and were unable to support themselves, and retreated to Fengjiadu'. At that time, the author was in Shigang, and not only did such things not happen, but there was no 'Fengjiadu' place in the Shigang area at all. The people of Shigang didn't know whether to laugh or cry after seeing it, but the communist parties in other places thought there was evidence that the Nationalist troops were not complying with the ceasefire agreement..."

These few days, after Mr. Zhou Enlai made a speech in Chongqing criticizing the KMT's Second Plenary Session for undermining the Political Consultative Conference agreements, he quietly flew back to Yan'an; the Communist Party representatives also avoided attending the National Political Consultative Conference held in the capital. Judging from the honest reports sent by our readers from Nantong, we can know who is plotting to undermine the results of the Political Consultative Conference. Spring rain in Jiangnan makes people feel depressed; but in the political field, isn't there also a feeling of annoyance like spring rain? Spring has arrived in Jiangnan, what kind of mood should the people of Jiangnan have?

The Suzhou Electric Light Factory Again Faces Coal Shortage

The Suzhou Power Plant, after ordering coal from Shanghai a week ago and transporting it to Suzhou, had only about 20 tons left as of the 22nd. Due to insufficient electricity transmission, it first partially stopped on the evening of the 22nd, and the entire city went dark at 10:30 p.m. The second batch of coal of more than 700 tons has not arrived yet due to continuous rainy days. If no coal arrives in Suzhou within two days, it will inevitably fall into complete darkness (including Wujiang and the Huxi area under the county). According to the person in charge of the factory: a coal ship previously loaded coal in Shanghai and sailed to Suzhou. When it passed near Gaochang Temple, it was sunk by a military ship. The remaining coal ships will arrive in Suzhou within a few days.

After the police bureau was ordered to arrest their debtors one by one, they interrogated them several times and dealt with them with reference to the handling methods of opium paste shops in the recovered cities and provinces in North China. The third section of the police bureau and the responsible persons of the former opium paste shop association dispatched personnel to investigate the business conditions of the opium paste shops at that time and the situation of shareholders and managers one by one, and formulated differentiated grading fine measures. The use of the fines was (1) to make a set of uniforms for all officers, officials, and police officers of the Qingdao Police Bureau, and (2) to be used as funds for establishing a drug rehabilitation hospital. All the managers and agents of the opium paste shops who were detained have been released on bail. The police bureau has specially organized a clothing committee to publicly bid for the production, and after the bidding is announced, it will order the responsible persons of each shop to pay the uniform factory.

### Grand Tea Party Held by the Engineering Community to Welcome the Engineering Planning Group - Over 300 Attended with Enthusiasm - Railway Group One Will Fly to Beiping this Morning and Proceed to North China

The Engineering Planning Group of the Executive Yuan was recently organized and established, with the general headquarters in Shanghai, and will begin planning the restoration and construction of national railways, highways, port and water conservancy projects. The group is composed of 15 American engineers and 30 Chinese engineers, who are about to depart to various places for inspection. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, four groups, namely the Chinese Institute of Engineers, the Chinese Society of Automotive Engineers, the Chinese Power Engineering Association, and the Chinese Institute of Electrical Engineering, held a special tea party at the International Hotel to welcome them. Hou Jiayuan, the head of the Engineering Planning Group, Mao Yisheng, the deputy head, Dode, the chief engineer, Wang Jujun, the chief engineer of the railway group, Kang Shizhen, the chief engineer of the highway group, Shao Fuzuo, the chief engineer of the port group, and engineers from various groups, as well as over 300 member representatives from the Chinese Institute of Engineers, etc., attended.

Zhao Zukang Delivers Welcome Speech

First, Zhao Zukang, the president of the Chinese Institute of Engineers, delivered a welcome speech, stating briefly that all the staff of the Engineering Planning Group of the Executive Yuan are well-known technical experts at home and abroad. Their arrival in Shanghai this time will surely provide much assistance and guidance for the city's restoration and construction. This city has been actively repairing roads since September last year, but due to funding and material difficulties, it has not been able to complete quickly. Currently, the total length of roads in the urban area is about 1,000 kilometers, all of which need to be repaired. There are also 500 kilometers of drainage channels (divided into sewage and rainwater) that need to be dredged, and they are now being carried out separately.

Chief Engineer Dode Delivers Speech

After Zhao's speech, Chief Engineer Dode of the Engineering Planning Group was invited to give a speech. He first explained that the 15 American engineers all work at the Morrison Knudsen Engineering Company in the United States. The company has done some practical work in South America and the Pacific Islands. Next, he explained the significance of coming to China to serve, which is to assist China in completing the restoration and construction of transportation and water conservancy projects. However, since the Engineering Planning Group has just been formed and has not yet set off for inspection, there is no actual material available for reporting. He then separately introduced the American engineers to everyone.

The Organization of the Group Has Extensive Significance

Next, Hou, the head of the Engineering Planning Group, gave a speech. He said that after the victory of the War of Resistance, the work of demobilization and restoration is very important, so the Engineering Planning Group was organized. The word "planning" has a very broad meaning, and usually plans cannot be executed, and they are easily reduced to empty paper materials, which are criticized by the general public. But the mission of this group is to do practical work, which must be completed within half a year. This year is the year of preparation for national construction, and all efforts must follow the most urgent and most needed paths. This group will adhere to this purpose to achieve success. However, the standard materials for various engineering plans still rely on the guidance of colleagues in the engineering community, and it is hoped that the Engineering Institute will often hold seminars on various practical engineering problems, gather ideas and discuss them, and provide this group with reference and lessons.

Mao Yisheng Introduces the Head of the Group

Deputy Head Mao Yisheng was invited to speak. Mao gave a very detailed introduction to the personal experience of Head Hou, praising Hou as the "Railway King." All railway construction from Hangzhou in the north to Myanmar in the south has been planned and managed by Hou. With his leadership, the Engineering Planning Group will naturally be able to fulfill its mission. As for the future work center of the group, Mao said that attention should be paid to the simultaneous development of railways, highways, ports, and water conservancy departments, but close contact and cooperation must be established with the Ministry of Transportation, the Water Conservancy Commission, the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and the national engineering community to avoid becoming a paper plan. After Mao finished speaking, Hu Songzhao, a representative of the Automotive Engineering Society, Chen Shiying, a representative of the Power Engineering Chang Society, and Haught, Tanks, and Wang Zhicheng, three engineers, gave speeches one after another, and the atmosphere was enthusiastic, until it dispersed at around 6:00 p.m.

Hou Jiayuan Gives a Speech

According to Head Hou, the group is divided into three groups: (1) the port group, with Wang Jujun as the chief engineer, (2) the highway group, with Kang Shizhen as the chief engineer, and (3) the railway group, with Wang Jujun as the chief engineer. Each group has one to three American advisers. The railway group will first go to North China to inspect the Tanggu New Port and the restoration projects of various railways in North China. The highway group will first go to the southwest to inspect highway projects. The port group will also go to North China to inspect water conservancy and port projects. The railway group is divided into four teams. The first team will fly to Beiping this morning and then go to North China for inspection. Also, Head Hou and Chief Engineer Dode will fly to Beiping by plane in early next month to inspect the construction of Tanggu Port.

### U.S. Sailor Snatches Diamond Jewelry and Refuses Arrest, with No Way to Escape, Commits Suicide Out of Fear of Punishment - A Police Sergeant on Bush Road Shot and Injured in the Hand

(Our Newspaper) Yesterday afternoon on Linsen Road (i.e., Avenue Joffre), a U.S. sailor robbed a diamond ring from a jewelry store and tried to escape with the stolen goods, and also opened fire to resist arrest. Because he had no way to escape, he committed suicide out of fear of punishment. The details are as follows:

Linsen Road

At about 3:30 p.m. yesterday, a U.S. soldier named Dahl entered Dachang Jewelry Store at No. 568 Linsen Road, claiming that he wanted to buy a diamond ring. Wu Yuzhi, a shop assistant, took out five diamond rings of different sizes and let him choose. The soldier selected three of them, including a diamond ring with 31 small diamonds, a diamond ring with 31 small diamonds, and a diamond ring with 23 small diamonds, estimated to be worth 450,000 legal tender.

The U.S. Soldier

After examining them for a long time, he put them on his fingers one by one, and then suddenly rushed out the door. Shop assistant Wu Yuzhi chased after him, shouting "Thief!" along the way. When the U.S. soldier went from Linsen Road to Chengdu Road South and turned to Bush Road, Sergeant Li Shaoji, No. 83, and police officer No. 4950 were patrolling here and bravely chased after him. At that time, the U.S. soldier heard the noise behind him and the number of pursuers was increasing, so he ran into Hehe Lane. Because one side of the alley was blocked, he came back out and ran,

Actually Opened Fire

Two shots were fired to resist arrest. One bullet grazed the hand of Sergeant Li, but fortunately it was minor. Seeing that the sergeant was injured, police officer No. 4950 behind him drew his gun and fired three shots in return, but none hit. The U.S. soldier crossed Chongqing South Road and passed through Bush Road to the alley behind the Jiuxing Grand Theater on Julu Road, but he knew that this alley was also blocked. At this point, knowing that there was no way to escape, he shot himself. The bullet penetrated his right temple and exited his left temple, and he immediately fell to the ground, barely breathing. Later, the U.S. military police team on Luban Road was notified and immediately sent many military police officers to the scene by car.

### Shanghai's Roads - Total Length Approximately 1,000 Kilometers - Over Half of Road Repairs Completed After Victory - Large-Scale Repairs Await Overseas Materials

— Our Correspondent Canglong

If you haven't forgotten, you should remember Shanghai's roads eight years ago. The smoothness of Nanjing Road, the straightness of Xiafei Road, the spaciousness of Minguo Road... But after eight years of enemy occupation, the iron hooves left scars on the road surface, and the devil's claws seized the tram tracks, leaving behind those ugly deep grooves... How to repair the old and renovate the new? How to open up new roads? Especially today, when Shanghai is repeatedly called the world's first-class metropolis, how can we complete the basic condition of smooth roads, even if we have to exert the energy of a young China?

According to the Public Works Bureau, since taking over road administration on September 12th last year, a surveying team was established. The survey results showed that the total length of roads in the city is equivalent to three times the distance from Shanghai to Nanjing, roughly 1,000 kilometers. An area of 340,000 square meters of this 1,000-kilometer road surface was found to be damaged. After the Public Works Bureau started work, the city was divided into six major work zones. These damaged roads have been successively repaired by the work zones. It is said that 200,000 square meters of damaged road surface have been repaired.

However, due to material shortages and too many roads needing repair, the current material used to repair major roads is still the smelly asphalt purchased from the Shanghai Gas Company, which can only cope with winter road repairs and will melt in the summer. Small and remote roads can only be repaired by scattering gravel into the potholes. This barely works. After a few heavy-tonnage military trucks drive over them, the potholes reappear. Therefore, old wounds are barely repaired when new wounds appear, endlessly cycling. People who don't pay attention won't notice that road repair work is underway.

When can Shanghai's roads be thoroughly repaired on a large scale? The director of the Public Works Bureau's road department told me that this time will not be too long, because the bureau has recently ordered a large batch of asphalt oil from the United States, which is expected to arrive by the end of April. Once the raw materials arrive, thorough repairs can be implemented.

The construction materials of Shanghai's roads can be roughly divided into four categories: (1) Cement concrete roads, (2) Asphalt concrete roads, (3) Sett roads, and (4) Cinder roads. The first type of road has the highest construction cost and is the most durable. There are not many of these roads in the city, such as the section of Ninghai West Road (formerly Rue Wagner). This type of road is highly susceptible to expansion and contraction due to hot and cold weather, so a small gap is left at regular intervals to allow for expansion. The second type of road also has a considerable construction cost, and the damage is currently the most severe. The main roads, such as Nanjing Road, Jinling Road, Linsen Road, and Zhongzheng Road, are representative of this type of road. The third type of sett road is made up of ordinary, irregularly sized stones pieced together. These roads are most common in the Nanshi area, and the road surfaces are uneven, making them the least popular among pedestrians and vehicles. The last type, cinder roads, are more common in the suburbs.

The road widening plan that has been initially realized is only the road on the north side of the Nanjing West Road Racecourse, which has been widened to 20 meters. However, the plans to widen Jielu Road to 35 meters and Zhejiang Road to 20 meters have been shelved due to the issue of demolishing houses. In today's housing shortage, this plan has been virtually stranded. However, it is guessed that the authorities intend to promote the entire road administration from the standpoint of benefiting the majority of citizens. It is said that the design of the entire urban road system will be based on existing airfields, stations, and docks, and the distribution and arrangement of roads will be coordinated accordingly!

### U.S. Latest Type Merchant Vessel - China Mail Expected to Arrive Today

Speed is Sixteen to Eighteen Nautical Miles per Hour

[Our Newspaper] The U.S.'s latest (C4) type merchant vessel, operating on the Pacific Sino-American route, the first American President Lines' World Banner Sea Arrow, arrived in Shanghai at the end of last month. It then departed Shanghai at the beginning of this month for Southeast Asia, passing through European ports and returning to New York via the Atlantic Ocean. It is learned that the company's second new vessel, the Sea Bao, carrying a large batch of relief supplies from New York to China, has now arrived at Dagu Port in Tianjin. After unloading the North China relief supplies, it is expected to arrive in Shanghai in early next month. It is also learned that the U.S. Foree Steamship Company has also built four new (C4) type mail ships operating on the Sino-American route. It is reported that the first China Mail has departed from Seattle, passing through San Francisco to Luzon, Hong Kong, and Shanghai, and is expected to arrive today. The vessel has a deadweight of 14,000 tons, a speed of 16 to 18 nautical miles per hour, and is equipped with modern facilities, including refrigerated compartments suitable for transporting fresh produce. Therefore, in addition to fruits loaded from the U.S., it has also loaded a large quantity of mangoes from Luzon. It will stay in Shanghai for three or four days and is scheduled to depart Shanghai for the U.S. on the 29th, heading directly to Seattle. According to the vessel's speed, it only takes two weeks to travel from Shanghai to Seattle, making it the fastest mail ship today.

### U.S. Military Demobilization - May Likely to be Completed - Most Agencies are Preparing to Close

Most of the agencies under the U.S. Military Headquarters in this area are preparing to close. According to reporters, the various departments of the U.S. military will determine the order of their closure based on how long they are needed, demobilizing separately between April and May. General Wedemeyer is scheduled to leave China and return to the U.S. on the 2nd of next month. His work will be temporarily taken over by General Wedemeyer's Chief of Staff, Major General Matt. It is not known whether General Wedemeyer will return to China after returning home. In addition, many ships have been allocated to transport troops back to the U.S. to handle demobilization. The General Cheatham is scheduled to sail from Seattle, USA, in late March and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on April 15, transporting most of the U.S. military back to the U.S. The Navy's USS Attu is also scheduled to arrive in China in May. The work of transporting U.S. troops back to the U.S. is likely to be largely completed in May of this year.

Unfinished Work Must Continue

The work that is becoming more intense with the demobilization of the U.S. military includes the U.S. Military Advisory Group in China led by General Magruder, the Executive Headquarters led by Special Envoy Marshall, and the U.S. Foreign Surplus Property Disposal Committee headed by General Georgeson. According to reports from various sources, Marshal Marshall will return to China soon, and his representative, General Gillem, is carrying out all of Mr. Marshall's duties in Chongqing. The heads of the various departments of the Executive Headquarters responsible by the U.S. held an important meeting in Chongqing at 9:00 PM last night. All the key U.S. military personnel of the Executive Headquarters flew from Peiping and Shanghai to Chongqing for the meeting the day before yesterday afternoon or yesterday morning. General Wedemeyer has announced that although the U.S. military is engaged in demobilization, the unfinished work must continue to be completed.

### Garbage Dumped into the Huangpu River - Unclean Drinking Water Endangers Health

Hoping the Health Bureau Will Immediately Investigate and Handle Properly

Dear Editor: Today, I am talking about the garbage problem in Shanghai, which is currently the most serious and urgently needs to be handled by the health authorities. It is said that the amount of garbage accumulated in the city every day is huge, reaching thousands of tons. Before the war, the Ministry of Public Works and merchants hired wooden barges to transport the garbage to designated locations for unloading, and there were water police to monitor to prevent boatmen from cheating. But now, the boatmen, disregarding public morality and seeking convenience, load the garbage to a point a little past [name unclear] Hua, in the river area called the Garbage Beach, and dump it into the river without unloading it on the shore, and no one investigates. This garbage is all filthy and unbearable, and the Huangpu River is the source of drinking water for the entire city. Now that garbage is thrown into the river, the citizens are ingesting large amounts of bacteria, how can they not get sick and endanger their lives? Moreover, as it accumulates over time, the Huangpu River will become clogged, and will the traffic between Jiangsu and Zhejiang be affected? Your newspaper serves the community, and I hope you will grant a small space to publish this article, so that during this period of promoting cleanliness and dredging the Huangpu River, the relevant authorities will see it and immediately send personnel to investigate and deal with it, in order to eliminate this harm and benefit the citizens. Sincerely yours, reader Yao Datian.

### Shanghai Leshan Society Continues Soup Kitchen

The Shanghai Leshan Society at No. 7, Lane 858, Haining Road, Shanghai, previously held a winter relief soup kitchen for two months due to the general hunger of poor households without food, from December 1, 1934, to the end of the first lunar month of 1935. This period has now expired, but honorary chairman Wang Xiaolai, chairman Huang Yantang, president Liang Yuming, and chief standing director Huang Yongqing, given the current high prices and the precarious lives of the poor, feel that the soup kitchen should not be stopped. They have made every effort to raise funds and have decided to continue the soup kitchen for another two months from April 1, again at the Society. This is truly good news for the general poor households, and the gentlemen's compassion and great ambition to help the world are worthy of praise.

### Gold Prices Stabilize, Speculation Concentrates on Securities, Including New "Full Position" Tickets

Since the Central Bank of China (CBC) allocated gold measured in rice, the financial trend has gradually stabilized. Speculation has shifted its target to raising the prices of Chinese and foreign stocks and government bonds. In the commodity sector, the rise in rice and grains is the most stimulating. High-quality rice consistently fluctuates around 31,000 to 32,000 yuan. Flour sales are quite strong, and prices are also tight, with "Warship Brand" once hitting the 10,000 yuan mark. Cooking oil briefly surged to 63,000 to 64,000 yuan, but then retreated to around 60,000 yuan. A detailed overview is provided below:

Gold: Last week, the trend of cooked (refined) gold was calm. However, on Monday, the news of the US suggestion to raise gold prices, coupled with the CBC's allocation of 1.62 million units, boosted sentiment, causing prices to fluctuate between 1.6 million and 1.7 million yuan. From Tuesday to Friday, the trend weakened. The CBC maintained the allocation price at 1.6 million yuan from Monday onwards, but the gold industry's absorption was not enthusiastic, and the black market price was already lower than the allocation price.

Foreign Currency: On Monday, US dollars hovered above 2,000 yuan. Because the US exchange rate remained stable, sentiment was idle, and supply and demand were scarce. Only money exchangers engaged in slight buying and selling. From Tuesday to Saturday, it retreated below 2,000 yuan, struggling above 1,900 yuan, with uncertain gains and losses. Old Hong Kong dollars remained stable at around 404. New issues (namely, the 1936 and 1937 series) suddenly became popular. Starting on Wednesday, a certain bank in the city created activity, attracting attention. Foreign firms took the opportunity to snap them up, and due to a shortage of chips (available currency/assets), a rising trend suddenly emerged. As of Saturday, it was still steadily climbing, exceeding 220 yuan and reaching around 230 yuan, already surpassing double the price of old issues.

Consolidated Bonds: Unified public bonds saw little interest from Monday to Friday, with narrow fluctuations. Category C bonds hovered above 1,600 yuan, fluctuating only by 30 to 50 yuan. On Saturday, due to speculators' desire for movement after extreme stillness, a buying trend suddenly emerged, and prices were firm. Category C once exceeded 2,000 yuan but then retreated to 1,920 yuan. Categories A and B rose to 1,005 yuan, Category D to 1,011 yuan, and Category E to 1,013 yuan.

Stocks: After the stabilization of gold prices, speculative groups sold off gold and switched to stocks, leading to a significant surge in the stock market. The market trend continued to rise. On Tuesday, foreign stocks saw a collective decline due to excessive floating profits. On Wednesday, Chinese stocks showed a very stable trend, especially in the afternoon, when the momentum was sharp. After yarn mills crossed the 4,000 yuan mark, they continued to advance, and other stocks followed suit. Foreign stocks also saw many gains amid a chorus of buying. On Thursday, buying sentiment permeated Chinese stocks, and the market trend shifted from large-cap stocks to small-cap stocks. Jingfu and Qinxing both broke through the 300 yuan mark. The rising trend of Xinguang was also fierce. Retail investors in foreign stocks sold off, and prices retreated slightly. On Friday, Chinese stocks initially experienced a slight setback at the opening, but later, large investors pushed up prices, and a fierce rising trend was sparked again among the "three smalls" (small cap stocks). The gains of large-cap stocks were relatively flat. Sentiment in foreign stocks was boosted, and they moved towards new highs. Over the weekend, Guangdong investors continued to absorb Chinese stocks relentlessly, continuing to push up prices and create new highs. The gains of foreign stocks were uneven, with Asia and Jardine Matheson being the most prominent.

Raw Yarn: Last week, initially supported by the rising trend of the previous weekend, coupled with strong buying from Guangdong investors, the trend was extremely strong, and prices hovered at high levels. 60-count Sunlight double-strand fine yarn once reached as high as 2.8 million yuan. Although major buyers such as Yuehan continued to purchase actively, the pressure was heavier due to the textile construction company taking over Japanese-owned yarn mills and operating day and night, actively producing yarn. Therefore, the rising trend gradually weakened. The highest price for the entire week was 2.8 million yuan for 60-count Sunlight yarn on Monday, and the lowest was 510,000 yuan for 10-count Jiahe yarn on Thursday. Except for 20-count Special Double Horse, which rose independently, all yarns uniformly softened, especially 42-count Blue Phoenix, which plummeted by 170,000 yuan, the most significant decline.

Fabric Market: Due to weak sales from buyers and distributors, and increased output from manufacturers, the market had an ample supply of chips (available product). The market trend was consistently weak for days, with all brands uniformly weakening by 3,000 to 6,000 units (currency unit not specified).

Cotton Market: Because the textile construction company took over Japanese-owned yarn mills and urgently needed raw materials, the purchase of fine cotton raw materials was quite large, so market prices remained firm. Only Zhoupu seed cotton was slow to move, falling by 7,000 yuan.

Rice and Grains: At the beginning of the week, the rice market rose due to continuous spring rains. Flour and cooking oil were both profitable, and sugar continued to decline. Local cotton and rice were particularly bleak. The next day, rice prices rose again by 2,000 yuan due to reports of price increases from production areas. On Wednesday, the weather cleared, and rice arrivals were particularly smooth, causing the market to turn towards easing, with uniform declines. Flour also softened. In terms of miscellaneous grains, raw peanuts had a particularly strong momentum, rising sharply by about 3,000 yuan. On Thursday, the source of rice increased, and the market trend continued to loosen, with high-quality rice falling by 500 yuan, and medium-to-low quality rice falling by 1,000 to 1,500 yuan. Flour was mediocre. Sales of cooking oil were matched by arrivals, with a slight drop of 500 yuan. Sugar flooded in, and the market trend was depressed. On Friday, the rice market showed a strong trend again due to rainy weather, with prices rising by several hundred to 1,500 yuan. Flour sales were active, also up by about 300 yuan. Miscellaneous grains uniformly declined, and cooking oil arrivals flooded the market with sluggish sales, causing a decline. Over the weekend, the rice market was initially firm and then weakened, with prices mostly the same as yesterday. Flour prices were high in other regions, rising again by over 400 yuan. In terms of miscellaneous grains, soybeans turned better by 300 to 500 yuan, raw peanuts saw mixed gains and losses, cooking oil declined by several hundred yuan, and bean cakes also fell by several tens of yuan.

### Eliminating the Division System, Concentrating Check Clearing, All Foreign Banks Participate

Before the war, due to the special circumstances of the environment, the check clearing system could not be centralized. For example, foreign banks' checks were jointly managed by HSBC and the Bank of China, while Chinese banks' checks were managed by the Shanghai Banking Association's Joint Reserve Committee's check clearing house, and money shops were managed by the Money Shop Association's Joint Reserve. After the victory, after the strenuous efforts of the financial authorities to improve the system, the divided system was eliminated, and centralized clearing was implemented. Banks and money shops found it convenient, and the results were excellent.

153 Clearing Banks and Money Shops

The Shanghai Check Clearing House is a merger of the original check clearing houses of the banking and money shop industries, and a new organizing committee manages all business. Representatives from the Central Bank of China (CBC) serve as the chairman of the committee. The "Four Banks, Two Bureaus" (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank of China, Central Trust Bureau, Postal Savings Bureau) and all foreign banks participate in the clearing. The allocation and settlement of all clearing balances between the banks and money shops are centralized at the CBC. As of last week, there were a total of 50 clearing numbers, meaning there were 35 directly clearing banks and 15 money shops. There were 63 banks, 33 money shops, and 7 trust companies that did not obtain clearing numbers and used agents for clearing. Banks and money shops that obtained clearing numbers opened accounts directly with the CBC to handle the allocation and settlement of clearing balances. Banks and money shops that did not obtain clearing numbers opened current accounts with the clearing house, and the clearing house deposited the daily clearing balance into the CBC, simplifying the procedure and unifying management.

Clearing Amount Increases Daily

Since the clearing house was improved and centralized, the daily total clearing amount can be checked on the same day, and the actual situation of market changes can be known at any time. For example, the check clearing amount in February of this year was 459,251,266,270.62 yuan, and the amount of checks cleared by agents was 208,453,034,719.64 yuan, totaling 667,704,300,990.16 yuan. The check clearing amount in January was 306,972,070,945.86 yuan, and the amount cleared by agents was 129,868,936,756.59 yuan, totaling 436,841,007,702.45 yuan. Therefore, the February amount increased by 50% compared to January, which reflects the expansion of market liquidity, rampant speculation, and price fluctuations in February.

### South American Cotton Expected to Have a Bumper Harvest

[Reuters, New York, 24th] It is reported that Peru's new cotton is expected to have a bumper harvest due to evenly distributed rainfall. The prospects for Paraguay's cotton harvest are also optimistic. If the weather is dry during the harvesting season, the quality is expected to be above average.

### US Tung Oil Production Reaches Half of Its Consumption

Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, China's foreign trade has almost completely stalled. In particular, tung oil, because it is widely needed in the United States, had over thirty substitutes developed. The most effective of these were linseed oil, perilla oil, oiticica oil, and dehydrated castor oil. Currently, the United States has planted tung trees on an area of ​​approximately 20,000 acres, with last year's output being 6.7 million pounds, only half of its consumption. Since the abolition of US tung oil controls, the maximum consumption is said to be as high as one million pounds. Therefore, there is a great hope that China's high-quality tung oil will be exported in large quantities.

### Arrivals from Home and Abroad: Glass... Cement... Mangoes

Large quantities of glass and cement arrived in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's Yuezhou wheel, which returned to Shanghai from Qinhuangdao, transported 6,000 cases of glass and 8,500 bags of cement. It arrived in the evening, berthed at buoys number six and seven, and was unloaded yesterday.

Luzon mangoes, which have not been seen for many years, are about to arrive in Shanghai. It is reported that the China Post ship of the Foo Lai Steamship Company, which is making its first voyage from Seattle to China, via San Francisco to Little Luzon, and then via Hong Kong to Shanghai, is expected to arrive around Monday or Tuesday next week. The ship has loaded a large batch of mangoes from Little Luzon. Having not been seen for six years, they can now be tasted again.

### Economic Briefs

The Provincial Bank Regulations have recently been promulgated, providing detailed provisions for the responsibilities and powers of local banks in various provinces. The financial department previously stationed supervisory officers in various provincial banks, but they are no longer necessary. It is reported that orders have been issued to abolish them.

The British government restricts overseas remittances to 45 yuan of remittance currency per person per month. This was noted in this newspaper. If the first batch exceeds this amount, it will be deducted in the following month. It is also stipulated that the total number of overseas Chinese in Nanyang (Southeast Asia) is used as the calculation base. If there are 1,000 overseas Chinese in Nanyang, then the monthly remittance limit is 45,000 yuan. Therefore, recent overseas remittances from Nanyang have been interrupted invisibly due to this restriction. The Star-Chang Bureau (a financial institution) explained that this is a small financial measure from the military government era, and it will be abolished once the military administration ends.

### From the Perspective of Legal Orthodoxy: Discussing the Inspection of Factory Boilers

— Tian Heqing

I recently read a news item on page 3 of your newspaper on the 17th of this month regarding the Municipal Bureau of Public Works' inspection of factory boilers, which stated: "The Municipal Bureau of Public Works, in order to prevent fires in factories and protect the safety of factories, neighboring buildings, workers, and the general public, has sent personnel to various factories to investigate boilers, electrical equipment, machines, and layout positions. If any factory equipment is found to be dangerous, they are instructed to move or improve it immediately. As of the end of February, more than 400 factories have been inspected, and more than 800 boilers have been registered..." After reading this news, I feel very surprised. It is indeed an urgent need for the Bureau of Public Works to carry out inspections for the safety of people and citizens in factories, but the question is to which administrative system does it belong?

According to the news report, the inspection work carried out by the Bureau of Public Works is clearly stipulated by national laws and must be carried out by specific factory inspection agencies. This factory inspection work had been exclusively and jointly carried out by the Shanghai Factory Inspection Institute for five or six years before the Anti-Japanese War. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Ministry of Social Affairs in the Great Rear Area directly trained legal personnel and sent them to various industrial zones to carry out inspection work without interruption. The person in charge of the current Bureau of Public Works must not be unfamiliar with the factory inspection system!

Factory inspection work is considered a very important administrative matter in all industrially advanced countries. The governments of various countries are particularly cautious about this work and implement it very strictly. It cannot be done by one or two scholars who only understand engineering, because the scope involved is very broad. Therefore, the National Government has been particularly cautious about this work. Since 1929, the Factory Law, the Factory Law Implementation Regulations, the Factory Inspection Law, and the Factory Safety and Sanitation Regulations have been promulgated successively. Before 1931, the Ministry of Industry once held a factory inspector training institute in this city to train a batch of legal inspectors and send them to various provinces and cities to carry out inspection work. In 1933, in order to further promote inspection work, the central government specially established the Central Factory Inspection Office in the capital to specialize in this matter. In September 1931, the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs established a special section to appoint trained personnel to carry out inspection work. This is not an ordinary administrative work. In 1933, the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities also planned to get involved in boiler inspection. At that time, there was a debate on the issue of legal orthodoxy at the municipal meeting. As a result, this was a specific power granted by law to factory inspectors and should of course be carried out by factory inspectors. At the same time, for the fire protection issues in factories, the Bureau of Social Affairs also had a written dispute with the Public Security Bureau. Unexpectedly, the current Bureau of Public Works wants to overturn the old case from more than ten years ago.

The Bureau of Public Works' current inspection work also has a history. This evolution was left over from the puppet government era. Tracing back to 1937, after the National Army withdrew to the west, the Public Works Bureau of the then Public Concession also had factory inspection work, which was presided over by Ms. Xing De, who recently returned to Shanghai. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the Japanese army entered the concession, and the factory inspection work was taken over by the Japanese. After the concession was taken back by the puppet government in a sham operation, the Public Works Bureau was renamed the First District Public Office. At that time, the inspection work was the responsibility of the Industrial Social Affairs Department. Last year, in the first half of the year, when the First District Public Office was abolished, the original inspection work of the Industrial Social Affairs Department was inexplicably merged into the Bureau of Public Works. After the victory, the receiving officers who flew from Chongqing took over all the files and personnel of the Bureau of Public Works, and Xiao followed the rules and continued to inherit the same pattern, so this work, which is clearly stipulated by national law and must be undertaken by specifically trained factory inspectors, was still carried out by the Bureau of Public Works.

The author does not oppose the implementation of factory inspection work, but this work, a system and legal orthodoxy that has been established for more than ten years, should be observed by both the government and the people. Especially in a country ruled by law, legal orthodoxy should be maintained and should never be undermined. The author is purely out of love for the factory inspection system to remind the government authorities to pay attention to the legal orthodoxy of this work. From the perspective of the industrial sector in this city, it is also hoped that the competent government authority managing factories should preferably be concentrated in one government office, which will preside over and manage it. The government can achieve twice the result with half the effort, and factories can also avoid many unnecessary troubles. It is hoped that the Bureau of Public Works will return this inspection work to the legal agency for execution as soon as possible.

In order to transfer the legal orthodoxy of this factory inspection power, there is a very important prerequisite that must be resolved, that is, the issue of Shanghai's factory inspection agencies should be resolved as soon as possible and restored as soon as possible. It is hoped that the Ministry of Social Affairs should not only address the issue of Shanghai, but also the entire factory inspection system in the country should be stipulated as soon as possible and established as soon as possible, so that both labor and management have something to rely on, and there will be no similar legal orthodoxy issues.

The schools in attendance included Yucai, Jinyuan, Gezhi, Jiju, Jinglai, Yangjing, Wuben, Preschool Teachers' Training, Wusong, and Xinlu, totaling ten units of representatives, and 39 teachers and staff attending from various schools. Five representatives were immediately elected to discuss everything with the Bureau of Education. Li Ximou, the Deputy Director of the Bureau of Education, and Chen Xuanxian, the Division Chief, were present. After several discussions, the various methods proposed by the delegation have been resolved with mutual understanding. Other welfare programs of the municipal government will be equally enjoyed by public education personnel. It was also decided that classes will resume in all municipal middle schools starting today.

### Municipal Elementary School Staff Association Sets External Responsibilities

[Dahua News Agency] The seventh regular meeting of the board of directors of the Municipal Elementary School Staff Association, in addition to listening to the association's representatives' report to the Bureau of Education on the disbursement of salary arrears and the temporary advance of emergency salaries of 50,000 to 80,000 yuan, expressed disagreement regarding the general representatives' meeting convened on the 23rd, where important issues were discussed without prior notification to the representatives of various schools, and the suspension of the joint deliberation of all directors of the board of directors. The association is the executive body entrusted by the general assembly to carry out association affairs, so it could not recognize the resolutions of a small number of representatives and stipulated that all external contact matters should be the responsibility of personnel appointed by the board of directors. In addition, for the purpose of introducing occupations, job registration forms have been set up. The contact points are located at Wanzhu Elementary School, Xiaozheng Road Elementary School, and He'an Elementary School. Those who need talent and those who seek teaching positions can make contact.

### Private Primary and Secondary School Friendship Association to Discuss Teacher Salaries

[Dahua News Agency] Recently, prices have increased several times compared to last year, so employees in all sectors have been demanding salary adjustments. The education sector, which is known for its integrity, is also unable to maintain itself due to the increasing difficulty of making a living. Therefore, the petitions of municipal elementary schools and the strikes of municipal middle schools have occurred one after another, and are now being discussed by representatives of various schools with the Bureau of Education. However, the treatment of private schools is even lower than that of municipal schools, so the issue of teacher salaries in various private primary and secondary schools in the city also urgently needs to be addressed. It is reported that the Private Primary and Secondary School Friendship Association will hold a special meeting to discuss solutions.

### Women's Movement in Hangzhou

### Student Records Confirmed in the Capital

[Our newspaper, Nanjing] After the victory, the student records of middle schools in the capital have been gradually sorted out and are now generally confirmed. A special analysis is provided:

University Preparatory Class Accommodating Preparatory Students

(1) The temporary university preparatory class established by the Ministry of Education, which has been discontinued, will accommodate preparatory students until the summer of this year. Those who pass the exam can also be admitted to regular universities after the summer. (2) Students who studied at several national secondary schools run by the puppet government will be accommodated by the Ministry of Education in three national temporary middle schools, No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3. Their student records will be graded according to their level during the entrance examination, and they will be rigorously assessed again during the winter vacation. (3) Municipal and private primary and secondary school education continued uninterrupted, but the principals of municipal schools were changed and adjusted in the winter after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. Most schools had screening effects during the winter vacation exams, so many students were dismissed, held back, or demoted.

Middle School Refresher Class Actual Study

(4) For young people who were studying in the free area but lost their schooling due to the environment and were displaced, the Ministry of Education's Recruitment and Training Committee (now renamed the Youth Re-enrollment and Employment Guidance Office) has established the Nanjing Youth Training Institute (similar schools for youth re-enrollment and employment are also located in Shanghai, Anhui, and Beiping) to accommodate and educate them. Among them, there are high and junior grades, with lectures on the main courses of middle school, and more civic and physical education training. In the past, the institute periodically distributed trained youth to various national temporary middle schools. It is now reported that in March, the training institute will be transformed into a refresher class for study advancement, expanding the curriculum to be consistent with that of general middle schools, still divided into high and junior grades for teaching. After the class change, it will be no different from general middle schools, and students will be assigned official student records. The class currently has 400 students, and it can be expanded to 500 students in the future depending on the school's capacity. The progress will be one semester for every four months of actual study without winter or summer vacations. When necessary, students can also be distributed to public middle schools to enter appropriate grade levels. ()

### An Episode Before the Opening of the Political Consultative Conference: Premier Song's Informal Tea Party

— A Special Dispatch from Chongqing on the 21st by Our Newspaper's Correspondent Zhao Haosheng

The morning of the 21st was devoted to economic reports and inquiries. At 4:00 PM in the afternoon, Premier Song of the Executive Yuan held a tea party in the Victory Building to entertain the Councilors.

In the hall, old-fashioned long tables were arranged in rows, with a short row of seats in the center. The walls of the auditorium were colorful, and the bright lights illuminated the white tablecloths and gleaming silverware, creating a magnificent sight.

Mr. Liu Wenlong arrived the earliest. Around 4:00 PM, several large buses arrived one after another, and the venue immediately became lively. Many Councilors took advantage of this time to take out their own proposals and ask others to sign them. Many people were still discussing the storm of the economic report and inquiry in the morning with great interest.

A Lively Gathering and Enthusiastic Handshakes

Premier Song appeared at the door, still wearing a dark green suit with a white silk scarf around his neck. He walked along the long table, shaking hands enthusiastically with each Councilor, and finally reached the door.

At the entrance to the hall, Shao Lizi stood on the left, and Premier Song stood on the right. Weng Wenhao, Jiang Menglin in a long gown and mandarin jacket, and Premier Song stood in a row, greeting the people who arrived one after another.

The hall was full. Without being invited by the host, everyone automatically helped themselves to refreshments. Premier Song invited a few people to sit in the row of seats in the center. Premier Song sat in the middle, with Jiang Yong, Li Huang, Qian Xinzhi, and Wu Runchu on the left, and Huang Yanpei, Chu Fucheng, and Yu Feipeng on the right. Shao Lizi and Weng Wenhao sat at the ends of the long table. Zhang Lisheng and Zhu Jiahua, as co-hosts, sat in the middle of each table. Wang Shijie, as a guest, also placed himself among the crowd.

The host stood up to speak, and the whole room applauded enthusiastically. Qian Xinzhi, because he was holding a pipe in his left hand, had to raise a spoon in his right hand and tap the plate in front of him to express his welcome.

The Host Raises His Glass and Blesses Everyone

Premier Song spoke in pure Shanghai dialect. He said that he did not speak the last time he entertained the Councilors. He originally planned not to speak this time either, but Mr. Shao Lizi had just told him that it seemed that the situation had already created the need to speak, and it was impossible not to speak. He said that his political report would be given at the general meeting tomorrow morning. In order to avoid delays at the meeting, he invited everyone here today to chat casually first. Finally, he raised his teacup and gave everyone his blessings.

After the host spoke, Chu Fucheng stood up and talked about the seriousness of the price issue, hoping that Premier Song would quickly come up with a solution. He talked about the sealing of goods and gold bar activities in Shanghai, and the difficulty of buying rice in Hangzhou. He kept waving the napkin in his hand to emphasize his tone.

Mr. Huang Yanpei Speaks as He Walks

Jiang Yong stood up and, as usual, raised his glass to thank the host. It seemed that the meeting was already coming to an end, but Huang Yanpei suddenly stood up to speak at this time. As usual, he greeted everyone first, but his movements were too slow, and many people had already stood up. His speech had already begun, and it was not good to stop abruptly, so he had to continue speaking. But people were already leaving their seats and walking outside. In this situation of scattering and speaking, Mr. Huang's speech ended inaudibly.

The meeting adjourned, and the hosts stood at the door again to shake hands and say goodbye to everyone. The last person to walk out was Huang Yanpei. (21st)

### Evening Scenery of Beng Mountain: A Heavy Town on the Huai River Shows its Beauty

*Report from this newspaper on the 21st. Contributed by Correspondent Qian Mengchao*

Bengbu is my second hometown. Before my current position, I lived in this city, which boasts both northern and southern Chinese scenery, for over a decade. I only tearfully left this beloved second home on the eve of its fall in early February of the 27th year. The victorious news filled me with excitement, and I finally returned to this important town on the Huai River from the provisional capital with a joyful heart.

Beng Mountain is Well

It is still doing well, the scenery as before. The several roads crisscrossing the city are still rugged and uneven, and the tall and short buildings on both sides have not changed much in the past eight years. Beng Mountain, standing tall on the southern edge of the city, remains graceful and well-arranged, with lush flowers and trees adorning this bright spring scenery. However, at the eastern and western foothills, many houses formerly occupied by the enemy and puppets have been added. Beng Mountain has endured more than seven years of bloody rule. Although the Japanese invaders surrendered in exhaustion, and the land has regained its light, the stains and traces here cannot be washed away even by flooding the Huai River.

Sightseeing at Zhongshan Park

Beng Mountain stands within Zhongshan Park, the only scenic spot for city residents to visit. Yesterday, I took advantage of a wisp of the setting sun in the evening after a rainstorm, and made a tour, my first visit since returning from Chongqing. The Cemetery of Anti-Japanese War Martyrs at the southern foot of the mountain was meticulously built by General Xu Tingyao. The cemetery still exists, but it has been neglected for many years and is gradually deteriorating. At the eastern foot of the mountain, the bronze statue of the famous Northern Expedition General Ma Wenbo has long disappeared. It is said that it was dismantled and taken away by the enemy. The tomb has been moved to the northern foot, and a stone tablet inscribed by the traitor Wang Jingwei stands majestically in front of the tomb. This stain should be removed as soon as possible. In addition, attractions such as "Dispelling the Clouds," the Sanmin Pond, and the Bandit Suppression Memorial Tower still exist, but the Fire Alarm Pavilion on the mountain ridge has been renovated. Soldiers are stationed here, prohibiting visitors from approaching.

The Huai River Winds Like a Snake

The Huai River resembles a long snake winding its way. Since the Yellow River reversed and flooded the upper reaches of the Huai River last year, the river water has taken on an orange-yellow color, as if dyed by countless grains of yellow sand. Little Bengbu, north of the river, still retains the appearance of a village. The old and new wharves on the south bank of the river have been completely transformed into mud and sand due to years of siltation, and no longer serve as mooring places for ships. Many thatched sheds have been built nearby. Recently, it has been said that the authorities plan to open a new eastern wharf behind Yuzi, east of the railway. Surveys have been conducted several times, but when construction will begin is still unknown.

Evening Scenery of the Huai River is Picturesque

The large iron bridge spanning the Huai River still maintains its majestic posture. Trains between Pukou and Xuzhou rush across it day and night several times a day. I recall that on the eve of Bengbu's fall in the 27th year, the National Army used explosives to destroy it, but it was soon repaired and reopened by the enemy. The scene is still vivid, but in these seven years, Bengbu has witnessed countless tragic events worthy of song and tears, and has also created countless hateful and shameful scandals.

A distant view of the Huai River at dusk, with sails like forests and seagulls flying over the water, people in the setting sun and twilight smoke, is truly a picturesque natural scene full of poetic charm.

Noisy Songs in the Northern District

The Huachang Street area and the alley in the Grand Hotel on Second Road were once famous pleasure quarters. Countless prominent figures, scholars, wealthy merchants, politicians, and military men left their traces and stories here. After eight years of the torrent of the Anti-Japanese War, these filthy places have still not been completely washed away.

Most of these "flowers" from the northern district are from Jiangdu and Xicheng. They perm their hair, powder their faces, apply lipstick, and wear high heels. Each one is fashionably dressed, no different from those in Shanghai. Every evening, when the lights are lit, there is a constant stream of traffic. The women, like flowers, flutter about in the streets, some leaving to serve customers, cooing and feigning anger, singing lewd songs. While this is certainly disgusting, there are still many who lavish money on them. The local public security authorities collect "flower taxes" as usual, reportedly 5,000 yuan per person per month. It is estimated that there are more than 300 prostitutes engaged in prostitution in Bengbu. Every evening, the scenery is beautiful and the music is loud, and one can imagine the situation.

After a gust of noon wind, the miserable sounds of beggars knocking on doors fly in, a stark contrast to the above situation, forming two different types of suffering. (March 21st)

### Record of Investigating Three Major Projects in Northern Henan

*Report from this newspaper. Contributed by Fan Shiqin*

Projects the Enemy Dreamed of Completing

The Japanese carried out three major projects in northern Henan, none of which were completed. One project, located southeast of Jiyuan, involved building canals across ten square *li*. Only one-third of this project was completed. If this project had been fully completed, the dry land around the ten square *li* of Jiyuan would have been transformed into paddy fields, wheat seedlings would have been replaced with rice seedlings, green water would have flowed constantly, and green crops would have lived forever. The majestic scenery of the north would have been combined with the delicate customs of the south. The second project was to divert the Qin River into the Grand Canal. A river channel from Qin County to Zhangcun in Boai County had already been dug, with only five sluice gates yet to be built. The enemy wanted to improve the soil in Qin County and Boai County to plant rice seedlings, and at the same time increase transportation capacity through river transport. Another project was quite grand, involving digging a 110-*li* long river channel from Wuzhi to northeast Xinxiang. Construction began in the winter of the 32nd year, and the enemy released water last year, reportedly with good results. Eighty percent of that project was still unfinished, and when fully completed, it would benefit five to six thousand *qing* of land. The enemy not only engaged in small acts of kindness, but sometimes seemed to undertake grand benevolent acts. These projects can be considered grand benevolent acts. However, the enemy's purpose was, first, to win over the hearts of the people in the short term, like building embankments in the Yellow River flood area, deliberately doing it for the people to see; but their ultimate goal was to further exploit our people. The enemy's development of northern Henan meant deepening their exploitation. Every foot dug deeper, every inch of water released, meant the people would shed an extra foot and inch of blood and sweat. Fortunately, now that we have been liberated, these projects are all in our hands, and we will complete these projects and bestow great benevolence upon our people!

Organizations and People Look North Eagerly

In towns and villages, many organizations, groups, and people heading north are lingering. Seeing those organizations, groups, and people gazing north, as if in a daze, they were overwhelmed with emotion. When you arrive in Xinxiang, there are even more organizations, groups, and people lingering than in Zhengzhou, and they return after running into obstacles, unlike those lingering in Zhengzhou who stop after seeing a sign that says "No Thoroughfare". Arriving in Anyang, there are even more organizations, groups, and people lingering than in Xinxiang, and they not only run into obstacles and turn back, but also experience life and death to get there.

In Anyang, there are countless commissioner's offices, and countless special commissioner's offices, and even more, I don't know how many exiled county governments. There are more than a thousand party and government workers from several counties in southern Hebei exiled in Anyang. They are now struggling to eat and clothe themselves, drifting aimlessly, with misfortune befalling them.

I grabbed a few party and government workers from southern Hebei and asked, "What's going on in southern Hebei?" According to them, the struggle in southern Hebei is fierce, and the sacrifices of Kuomintang members are great beyond description. Wu Te, the secretary-general of Lincheng, died heroically; Li Zhenyuan, the county magistrate of Cixian, and Wang Shaozeng, the secretary-general, died at the same time, with more than 200 comrades killed. Yang Xiaoting, the secretary-general of Feixiang, and Zheng Ganqing, the secretary-general of Guangping, jointly defended Feixiang City for 74 days. Currently, there are teams from 14 counties near Xingtai, led by party affairs supervisors Ren Xiaomin, Guo Shutang, Liu Shuyuan, and Xingtai secretary-general Yu Huai, holding high the banner of righteousness amidst the fragmented landscape. Lu Zihe, the secretary-general of Jize, is independently supporting the situation in Handan. In other counties such as Nanhe, Baixiang, Linluoguan, Chengan, and Yongnian, brave and loyal people are firmly guarding their posts. Comrade Xu Zhongqi of Linluoguan is exceptionally brave and fearless, so some call him "Xu Ironhead".

The Living are Destitute, the Dead are Wronged

Under the gloomy circumstances, the tragic struggles and heroic sacrifices of some people are rarely known. They are very unfortunate, the living are destitute, and the dead are silently wronged. In Luoyang in the past, seeing some exiled provincial governments, I felt extremely sad. This time in Anyang, meeting those loyal and brave patriots, that sad feeling resurfaced, and it felt even more unbearable. I only hope that Chinese history will quickly enter a new era of righteousness, so as to avoid this kind of unfortunate tragedy from happening again. (March 13, Jizhou)

### Initial Contact with the True Face of "Treasure Island": Taiwan's Crisis Awaits Overcoming

*Report from this newspaper on the 16th. Contributed by Twilight, from Taipei*

From Southern Fujian

From the top of Drum Mountain in Fuzhou, at an altitude of 2,800 *chi*, we can look far across the sea to Taiwan. Separated by a strait of raging waves, the voyage is 144 nautical miles, a short distance that would only take two or three days of walking on land, but it took us a whole month to safely arrive at our destination.

We originally estimated that there were regular voyages from Fuzhou to Taiwan, so we took a two-day, three-night voyage to Fuzhou. Unfortunately, the powered junks bound for Taiwan had been requisitioned, sailing ships were too risky, and the China National Aviation Corporation's scheduled flights had not yet materialized. A group of more than 20 people could request a plane, but the fare would be calculated from Shanghai, which was a great blow to us. Our only belief was to wait, wait for a ship.

We inquired with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and the reply was that more than 2,000 people had already registered to go to Taiwan. A ship was expected at the end of the month, but whether we could squeeze into the first two batches was questionable. Fortunately, through someone's intervention, we finally bought tickets for a ship sailing on March 10th. The powered junk was managed by the Taiwan Provincial Department of Transportation and was about 96 tons. It was a wooden-hulled fishing boat that had been taken over, but it was equipped with a diesel engine, so it was called a "bang-bang boat" in colloquial speech. The entire crew was composed of Japanese prisoners of war because they only received a monthly salary of 200 yuan, which led them to collude with certain individuals to engage in smuggling and taking passengers. According to regulations, this ship could carry 80 people, but 40 people were temporarily added, and the result was that more than 200 passengers were crammed aboard. This group was not composed of government officials going to Taiwan, but rather single traders who regularly traveled back and forth. The captain and the Fuzhou China Merchants Steam Navigation Company welcomed them because the regulated fare of 12,000 yuan could be privately raised to 58,000 yuan, a staggering amount. But this added to the great suffering and mortal fear of the travelers.

The main discomfort was not just the heavy load, with people squeezed together like dead pigs, and no water to drink, but also the irregular sailing schedule of the ship. It wouldn't sail if the wind direction wasn't right, if the weather was bad, or if the captain was sick. The passengers had no right to ask, and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ignored them. All the power was in the hands of the prisoners of war. Their poor management and embezzlement were hateful, and the lack of Chinese talent was also pitiful.

The ship, which was scheduled to depart on the 10th, bid farewell to the Min River on the 6th and arrived in Taiwan after four days and four nights, thanks to good fortune. The winds and waves in the Keelung Strait are unmatched in the north and south oceans. The crew constantly watched the flow of the raging waves, fearing that the bow would be swallowed by the waves. The ship's angle of inclination was often around 38 degrees, and two more degrees would mean the loss of life. When they finally stepped onto the Keelung wharf, the tired and nearly dead passengers looked at each other and celebrated their rebirth!

The arduous sea journey from Shanghai to Taiwan took a month, fraught with danger and shock. As I, the reporter, pen this dispatch, I still feel lingering fear in my heart!

Keelung Rain Scene

Looking at Keelung from afar on the blue sea with its surging waves, it is within sight but out of reach. After the ship enters the harbor, looking back, one doesn't know which direction the ship came from! The advantage of this military port is not only because ships of several thousand tons can directly dock at the wharf, but also because it is surrounded by high mountains with forests. The verdant green and the blue sea waves complement each other.

Taiwan belongs to a humid and mild zone with a very strong maritime climate. When we landed, the clothes we wore in Fuzhou didn't feel too hot, but the misty mountains, harbor, and street corners were constantly covered with light rain. We wandered through the city in the rain, starting to come into contact with the true face of Treasure Island. We stayed in the city government guesthouse, which had been converted from a hotel. It was next to the station. Opening the window, we could see the outline of Keelung Harbor. Walking around the streets with an umbrella and wearing long boots, the mud felt like the yellow plum season in southern China, humid but not refreshing. Light rain fell, and people spent long days in the rain.

The streets are wide asphalt roads, and people are wearing worn-out cloth clothes and wooden clogs, struggling for life. There are no large-scale stores here, only sheds built of wooden planks, opening food shops and retail stores. The scene is like refugees after a major fire. Indeed, there is not a single habitable house in the central area of Keelung City. They have all been destroyed by bombing. The streets are full of small piles of concrete, earth, and bricks. The post office building seems to maintain its past majestic appearance, but it has been covered with thousands of bullet holes. The power of the bombs has forced the transportation station and railway station along the pier to be left with a broken skeleton. The ships sunk and sunk by bombing in the harbor further reveal their wreckage. People are all looking for a way to survive in the rubble, building makeshift new homes after the bombing. On the other side of the rubble scene, we also saw thousands of Japanese expatriates waiting to be repatriated. The miserable faces of the men and women and the embarrassment of the children made people feel a surge of sympathy beyond the hatred of aggressors, believing that this is human sympathy!

Passing by a banana shop, I bought a catty for six yuan and four jiao in Taiwanese currency. The shopkeeper told us that everything was rising in price. Bananas used to be only three cents a catty, oranges used to be one yuan and two jiao, but now they are twelve yuan a catty. The main thing is rice, which has risen to eighteen yuan and five jiao a catty. With this unprecedented cost of living, the people not only cannot get the comfort of victory, but on the contrary, it has given them the greatest hardship, and they have begun to live on sweet potatoes and mixed grains.

At the station, I saw the stationmaster who had taken over. He was very eager to talk to us. He said, "I have been here for four months, and the second batch has not yet arrived. It's really lonely!" The lonely Keelung in the rain, I don't know when it can clear up and let people enjoy a little happiness of victory?

Taipei Stroll

In the past, there were many trains from Keelung to Taipei, like trams; now it is very different, with fewer trains and frequent delays, said to be because there are few locomotives and it is difficult to dispatch. We took a ticket from Keelung to Taipei for five yuan and five jiao in Taiwanese currency, and that was the end of the discussion.

After a short distance, we passed through three tunnels and followed the road, winding through the mountains on equal footing with the cars. The surrounding mountains are covered with tea trees, and under the coconut groves, we can smell the fragrance of bananas and osmanthus. In the plains, the ancient, purely Chinese farming methods are still appearing on this electrified and industrialized island. Farmers are using oxen to plow the fields, like the waterwheels in eastern Zhejiang scooping up spring water to irrigate the newly planted rice fields. People are returning to a normal and peaceful life in a time of peace.

Taipei Station, like Keelung, has been baptized by bombs. Because it was five o'clock, people were returning from the city to the suburbs, and the station was crowded with people. We walked from the station to our destination and settled down.

Taipei is the heart of Taiwan, the seat of the Governor-General's Office and the Provincial Government during the Japanese era. During the war, this place was also bombed and changed its face. The Governor-General's Office, the High Court, and the tall Western-style buildings in the neighborhood were all destroyed. Decades-old banyan trees, leaving their original roots, grew new branches, and in the rubble fields, people still seemed to recall the terror of being bombed and the arrogance of the Japanese before the bombing. The Provincial Government is unscathed and is now the hub for building a new Taiwan! Longgong Administration.

A high degree of industrialization and the Japanese's hard work have turned the island of Taiwan into a purely Japanese-style modern capital. Its original character cannot be seen not only in the appearance of the city, but also the essence of the Taiwanese seems to be detached from the tradition of the motherland, although we are everywhere where the Japanese language used to be, now it has been changed to Hokkien, and the number of women wearing cheongsams has also increased.

The level of education in the region is very high, and children are receiving compulsory national education, with hundreds of school units, but now most of them have been suspended because the school buildings are occupied by soldiers, and there is no way to resume classes.

Taihei-cho in Taipei is full of stalls selling second-hand goods, just like Qu Jiang Road in Shanghai. They are all things sold by the Japanese. Many couples are doing business together, and even men and women and children are being called to sell, in order to prepare more money to return to their conquered homeland.

Demolishing Houses and Selling Them Secretly

The people of Taiwan are now in unprecedented despair for the past 51 years. They held high hopes at the time of victory, but now they are disappointed, and they have sunk into the abyss of pessimism due to the rising cost of living, gradually losing popular support, and further affecting public security, and the abuse of power by some receiving personnel has also given the people a bad impression. Because the government cannot employ general intellectuals and young people, it has caused some serious unemployment panic, that is, those who have been re-elected, seeing the politics, cannot quickly get on the right track, and have gradually expressed passive resistance, we must point out: this is the current crisis in Taiwan Province.

In a period after we..., because of the panic of the Japanese, the people of Taiwan were given the opportunity to cause chaos. When the central government came, some illegal Taiwanese colluded with some corrupt workers, disrupted public security, and perverted the law for bribes. To give an example, when Japanese expatriates were repatriated back to their country, what the government received from the property of the expatriates was only immovable real estate, which could be moved had long been moved away, and recently even houses have been stolen, demolished and sold, the scene, people say is compared with Shanghai, fifty steps compared to one hundred steps, it is really regrettable!

The government's governance of Taiwan certainly has a set national policy, but it is worth embracing to take governing Taiwan by Taiwanese as the ultimate standard of governance. The staff going to Taiwan Province should be deeply vigilant and strive to preserve the vitality of Taiwan Province, and must not hold the distorted mentality of the conqueror.

Taiwan's weak "Political and Economic News" said: It is difficult for a light-industrialized and backward country to manage heavy-industrialized Taiwan, but we only hope to be able to do not to advance, and maintain the status quo, but just maintaining it, is so unbelievable that it can be done!

### The New China that Concerns the British: A Lack of Full Understanding of Chinese Issues, Revealing Jealousy Towards America in Matters of Interest

— Special Correspondence from London by Xueyan, Our Newspaper's 14th Day Airmail

When someone newly arrived from China meets British friends, they are invariably asked, "What is China like now? What is the Chinese impression of Britain?" The person being asked inevitably feels that such broad questions are difficult to answer. After residing in Britain for some time, letters from friends in China often include a sentence like, "What is the British impression of China now?" This is equally bewildering and difficult to answer. It is natural for the people of the two countries to be concerned about each other, but it is also a fact that mutual understanding is insufficient.

**A Flick of a Finger Can Point Out Reasons for Concern**

The British concern for China is self-evident. A simple flick of a finger can list more than ten reasons. For example, Britain and China were allies in this war, Britain was the first Western country to have entanglements with China, Britain was the European country with the most trade relations with China before the war... all of that goes without saying. Just take Hong Kong, India, and Burma. The British naturally consider them to be part of the British Empire. These lands are all adjacent to China and have special relationships with China. Therefore, in the eyes of the British, Britain is practically China's neighbor. Especially Hong Kong, from a historical and racial perspective, we know that Hong Kong is a Chinese world. From an administrative system perspective, the British still consider Hong Kong to be part of Britain. From this point of consideration, many related relationships arise. Chinese people traveling on the London Underground may be patted on the shoulder and asked, "Friend, can you let me know if you are from a part of China?" If you say Shanghai, the answer is: "Good place, I've been there in 19xx..." Then you can talk for a long time, even asking about the well-being of friends in China. The same situation can also be encountered in restaurants or hotels. There are quite a few British who have reached China, of course, the reason is that there were too many opportunities for former troops, warships, and merchant ships to come and go. Perhaps that's why. Many British people feel that they have a very deep relationship with China, only estranged by the war in recent years. In these years, naturally, they have heard not-so-good news about China, but because the news itself often contradicts itself, it is generally difficult to know the truth. It is only natural to ask around when encountering Chinese people.

**The Entire Report is Often Not Very Fair in its Stance**

There is no question that Britain is very concerned about China today. It is a fairly widespread phenomenon. However, the points of concern vary from person to person. There are many aspects that are not easily imagined by those of us in China. The amount of Chinese news published in British newspapers today is not that great. Most of the most important issues in China have been mentioned in British newspapers. The British Broadcasting Corporation also often has Chinese news. For example, the Political Consultative Conference, the ceasefire agreement, the reorganization of the army, and the recent Northeast problem have all been reported on the main points. People who care about the situation in China can also barely get a general idea. But unfortunately, British reporters, when reporting on Chinese events, often harbor old ideas and irresponsibly insert a sentence or two, causing the entire report to lose its fair and objective stance. For example, the Manchester Guardian recently reported on the establishment of the Sino-French agreement, when the National Army was about to hand over northern Vietnam to the French army, the reporter, when mentioning that the communique did not mention the exact date of withdrawal, suddenly added a sentence full of arbitrary atmosphere, saying, "This may be because the Chinese government is not sure whether the local garrison can obey orders." Also, when French warships bombarded Haiphong, most of the newspaper headlines read "Chinese troops bombard French warships" or "French warships were bombarded," which did not match the content. As for the news issued by our Central News Agency, saying that French warships fired first, it was quoted in quotation marks, expressing doubt. However, a few of the more left-leaning newspapers did not make such headlines, but only stated the facts, without implying any bias. Generally speaking, the attitude of British journalists towards China does not seem to be as enlightened as that of the general public.

**British Intelligence Department Plans to Hire Students to Write Articles**

From our Chinese perspective, the British press seems to not understand China enough. Conversely, Britain hopes that the Chinese people can understand them more, and they are very eager. The British Broadcasting Corporation broadcasts in Mandarin and Cantonese Chinese every day, targeting Chinese people, hoping to make the Chinese people more aware of Britain. At the same time, the British Intelligence Department has recently considered hiring a few Chinese students to help them write news about Britain, which is telegraphed to the news commissioners in the British Embassy and supplied to the newspapers for adoption. Because Chinese students select British materials, they naturally understand the Chinese psychology better, and there is a greater chance of winning agreement in China. Recently, in a China dispatch in the Daily Telegraph, it severely criticized the errors in the British propaganda method, saying that Britain's many contributions and sacrifices during the war did not make a deep impression in China, but the hardships of British domestic life and the news that Britain had to borrow from the United States were published a lot in Chinese newspapers, so that in the impression of the Chinese people, Britain is just a poor country. The Manchester Guardian recently pointed out in a Kunming dispatch that the British Information Service in China, although once closed, has been reorganized and is now issuing a large number of press releases. Chinese people who are eager to understand the world situation read the news supplied by the United States, so they have a deep impression of the United States. Therefore, this reporter advocated that Britain should also follow suit.

**The Seminar Reveals a Jealous Attitude Towards America**

It is very strange that although Britain recognizes the need to cooperate with Britain in general foreign policy, in matters of interest, the intensity of competition and jealousy is beyond what can be imagined at home. Today, many British people, when thinking of the Far East, cannot help but think of the powerful enemy, the United States, and cannot help but express indignation. Therefore, when mentioning China, they cannot help but cautiously attack the actions of the United States in China. When the reporter first arrived in Britain, by chance, he attended a seminar organized by the China Campaign. The host that night was a Labour Party member named Collag Iiam. He had been to the front line and had a considerable understanding of the Chinese issue. That night, he analyzed the issue of the Nationalists and Communists, and many of the points were insightful. Later, when talking about the attitude of the United States towards the Chinese government and the Communist Party, he attacked the United States very fiercely. The other people present also expressed the same sentiment, and their attitudes were very somber. This member of parliament later resigned in anger because he opposed the conditions agreed to by the government for loans from the United States. At that time, the reporter had just arrived in London, and although it was not difficult to infer from their arguments that they were motivated by jealousy, the depth of jealousy for Chinese affairs to such an extent was surprising to the reporter. Later, after getting along with the British for a long time, I learned that this kind of jealousy is quite common. Last year, about a hundred students came to Britain to study with Geng Kuan and British scholarships. Some of them went to factories for internships. It is said that many bosses and managers of regular factories directly asked them whether they would prefer British goods or American goods when they returned to China to purchase materials in the future.

**Britain Expresses Opposition to Studying in the United States**

Furthermore, the courses for the selection of students studying abroad in China now are all based on China's needs, which is theoretically very correct. However, before sending them to this country, they did not carefully inquire whether the schools in this country have this subject. In recent years, most of the students sent abroad by China are practicing applied science, but applied science is not recognized as advanced knowledge in many countries and is not included in graduate schools. This is the case in Britain, so many people who come to Britain to study their specialty of applied science in graduate school find that they have gone down the wrong path. Some therefore rush around, unable to find their place, some change their careers, and some do not want to change their careers and want to go to American schools, but encounter opposition. British scholarships are out of the question. Even for Geng Kuan students, it is said that British directors also oppose it and cannot fulfill their wishes. In previous sessions of the British Geng Kuan students, there were those who wanted to change to study in the United States, but none succeeded. Only in the sixth session, when Britain was heavily bombed and the students could not study with peace of mind, were they sent to Canada, but they were not allowed to go to the United States.

**The Atmosphere of Unease May Be Slightly Eased in the Future**

Speaking of the British jealousy of the American mood, I would like to mention a very interesting diplomatic event. The British and Soviets have conflicts of interest in Iran, which was already the case in the era of Imperial Russia. Later, because of the Russian Revolution, it was unable to develop outwards. Later, because of the fox kingdom revolution, there was no strength to develop in the meal, so there was a short period of Ning Jing. After this battle, the Soviet army won, and took the opportunity to seek the "foreign development" that Imperial Russia had sought. As a result, the British and Soviets competed for supremacy in Iran again, which was a matter of course. By the end of last year, because northern Iran demanded autonomy, the situation had deteriorated considerably. Just at this time, the United States proposed opening the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers' Rumor. Britain gladly participated, hoping that the Iranian issue could be resolved in the Three Foreign Ministers' Rumor. However, in the Rumor, it is said that although the Soviet Union did not show any concessions to the United States, it remained tough on Britain, so that Britain's original hopes could not be realized at all. For a while, British newspapers, when talking about the Iranian issue, always talked about the Soviet troops in the East Nine Provinces in the same breath, and the tone was quite somber. In the eyes of the British, the East Nine Provinces should be the location of the US-Soviet conflict, so the extent to which the Soviet army acted in the East Nine Provinces, regardless of the treaty, was only slightly less than in Iran. Britain believed that it was the Soviet Union's tone of Xuan Yu between Britain and the United States. When Iran submitted the case to the United Nations Security Council, and the Soviet Union and Ukraine also proposed requiring British troops to withdraw from Greece and the Dutch East Indies as counter-cases, British newspapers keenly felt that the Soviet Union did not simultaneously demand that American troops withdraw from China, which showed that the Soviet Union was more cautious about the United States. This attitude can often be seen in British newspapers. Well, recently, there have also been problems with the Soviet army in the East Nine Provinces, and the United States has also lodged a strong protest against the Soviet army's delay in withdrawing from northern Iran. The British sense of indignation will be slightly eased in the future.

Special Edition on Production and Construction

### Hopes for the Production Sector

— Han

I remember that when the government moved west to the temporary capital, Chongqing, the center of all industries also shifted to the Sichuan-Guizhou area. At that time, due to the changes in the situation and the blockade of international routes, everything presented a "different price in the morning and evening" increase, especially in the period when victory was about to come, prices rose several times! At that time, manufacturing plants were indeed facing a serious threat. Due to the instability of prices, after the products were sold, they could not get back the required raw materials, so the income and expenditure were disparate, and the losses were huge! Some manufacturers were still steadfast, struggling to support themselves, but most factories still purchased raw materials, but did not start work. Their output was still the original raw materials. They had withdrawn from the production sector and were engaged in speculative hoarding! As a result, product output decreased sharply, speculators increased, prices rose with the tide, and the people's suffering deepened day by day.

Now, the price fluctuations in the recovered areas are no different from those during the war; the existence of the crisis is indeed serious. The stimulation of this bad environment is enough to hinder the development of the production industry. The existing production sector should have a high degree of vigilance, seek the development of production, the improvement of production, and then stabilize prices in the extreme fluctuations of prices! In order to save the overall situation of the rise and fall of people's livelihoods, even if it means sacrificing some interests, they should strictly adhere to their posts, actively solve the entire problem, and assume the responsibilities that the production sector should fulfill. Then we can talk about how to industrialize.

### Production First

The British Efficiency Magazine once expressed the opinion that the composition of a country is industry, commerce, and agriculture, so politics actually occupies a very small part, and the government's income is also mainly based on taxes, so the news published in newspapers should also focus on the construction of industry, commerce, agriculture, etc.

This opinion was expressed a few years ago, but it is even more relevant to the current situation in China. Therefore, "Production First" can be said to be the most suitable slogan for the current era.

### Urgently Needed Sewing Thread Raw Materials

— Luo Liqun

Regardless of the type of industrial product, the selection of raw materials is an important factor in determining the quality of the product. In industrialized countries, many factories' main raw materials are self-sufficient, because they can not only reduce costs, but also obtain the quality required to match the products.

Taking the thread making industry as an example, the Lian Tiao brand of wood yarn, which was once popular in China, because the main raw material of cotton yarn was specially spun, so the uniformity and tensile strength of the fiber were in line with the standards of thread making.

The history of the development of China's thread making industry is not long, the equipment is not yet sound, and the acquisition of raw materials has always relied on the supply of yarn factories. Before the war, yarn factories specially spun cotton yarn for thread making, but now the products spun by general yarn factories are mostly needed by cloth factories and other woven products. Although there are also cotton yarns available for thread making, the tensile strength and uniformity do not meet the standards, so that the selection of raw materials for the thread making industry has encountered considerable difficulties.

Now that the maritime ban has been lifted, foreign goods are taking the opportunity to come in. If the raw material problem is not urgently solved, how can we compete with them? The future development of China's thread making industry will inevitably enter a major crisis. To solve this problem, in addition to the thread making industry itself working hard to find ways to solve the self-sufficiency of raw materials, it is also hoped that the yarn factory industry can specially spin and supply cotton yarn on the market according to the raw material needs and production volume of the thread making industry. Please do not ignore the importance of the thread making industry in production and construction, and cooperate with each other.

Although the problem of sewing thread raw materials has not yet been resolved, the Fei Lun Sewing Thread Factory will never compromise on the selection of raw materials due to difficulties. The raw materials used are specially spun by a certain yarn factory, so the quality is more improved than before, and on the other hand, it actively configures spinning equipment, hoping to achieve the ideal standard in the products.

### The Seriousness of the Raw Material Problem of Handkerchief Weaving Factories - Hopes for China Textile Construction Corporation

— Yao Siwei

Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the whole country has been shouting "production and construction" in unison, but due to the lack of raw materials, this slogan has not yet been officially realized. And our handkerchief weaving industry is even more suffering from such a serious problem.

It is found that our handkerchief weaving industry has more than 100 companies in Shanghai alone, with a total of more than 2,000 looms. If fully operational, it can produce more than 10,000 dozen per day. The raw materials used require more than 10 pieces of cotton yarn, divided into 8.9 tenths of 60 single yarns and 1.2 tenths of 84 double and triple yarns and 100 double yarns and 120 double yarns. Although cotton yarn of 84 counts or more is only needed by a few manufacturers, such as Huanqiu Factory, etc., the problem of seriousness arises with these cotton yarns of 60 counts or more.

Although China's national policy is to establish the country on agriculture, most of the products are inferior to those in Europe and the United States, especially the production of the main agricultural product "cotton" has been decreasing year by year after this long war, and all the products can only spin coarse yarn of 20 and 40 counts. If fine yarn of 60 counts or more is to be produced, foreign cotton must be used.

Shanghai, during the enemy and puppet occupation period, according to the statistics of the monthly report on imports and exports of customs, in the 29th year of the Republic of China, the handkerchiefs exported from January to June totaled 213,724 dozen, and in the 30th year of the Republic of China, from January to June, they had increased to 325,584 dozen, all sold to Hong Kong, Singapore, the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines and other places. In recent years, due to the war, transportation has been blocked and has been suspended, but since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, orders have been placed in various parts of Nanyang, and if sea transportation is unimpeded in the future, the sales volume must be considerable, which can increase the input of foreign capital into the country and will also contribute to production and construction.

Handkerchief factory colleagues, in view of the raw material problem, is becoming increasingly serious, and there are only a very small number of 60 single yarns on the market, and the selling price of more than 60 double yarns is almost twice as high, which is due to the relationship between supply and demand, resulting in general merchants speculating and raising prices. However, the raw materials used in our industry are all single yarns, which increases the cost and of course affects production.

After the general meeting passed a resolution requesting the China Textile Construction Corporation to find ways to supply raw materials, representatives and the author were sent to the company to explain the seriousness of the problem in person. If the raw materials were cut off, thousands of workers would lose their jobs, which would affect society. Mr. Wu Weijing, Deputy Manager of the Company, and Mr. Jiang Xianlu, Director of the Business Department, agreed to find ways to supply them continuously.

Bearing the good intentions of the China Textile Construction Corporation, the 60 single yarns that had never been opened for sale were listed for sale on the 21st of this month. The selling price of each piece is 4.25 million yuan. However, we questioned the excessive price, because the same 60 double yarns only cost 2.5 million yuan, and the difference is the same as the general market. If our handkerchief colleagues use such expensive raw materials, the cost will increase, and the production and sales will be more affected, so we have to send representatives and the author to contact the China Textile Construction Corporation again. Mr. Wan Zuochen was kind enough to delay the interview. After inquiring about the reason for the price difference, it was answered that it was also due to the "relationship between supply and demand". If it is reasonable, the price of 60 single yarns should be slightly higher than that of 60 double yarns, because the procedures for spinning yarn are more complicated for double yarns than for single yarns.

China Textile Construction Corporation is the only state-owned commercial institution in our country, and of course it aims to support industry and commerce and develop production. Any move is enough to affect the national commerce. It is hoped that the company's authorities will use fair and reasonable prices to curb the bad habit of speculation. If it is also due to the "relationship between supply and demand" and the price also rises following the market, I think it seems to be somewhat contrary to the original intention of the founding.

### Mutual Discussion on Management in General

— Xu Baiyi

(2) The Connection of the Three Major Departments

Production, sales, and economic management are the three important departments of general industry and commerce. To ensure that a business has a solid foundation and rapid development, these three departments must develop equally. At the same time, in addition to equal development, there needs to be a close connection. This can be illustrated with a clear analogy: managing a business is like farming. Production is like sowing seeds, sales is like harvesting, and economic management is like coordinating with the weather. Diligent sowing naturally leads to a bountiful harvest. At the same time, to have a bountiful harvest, we naturally have to diligently sow seeds. But besides these two efforts, we also require favorable weather throughout the year. Only then can growth and prosperity reach the anticipated goals. If the weather is unfavorable, such as long periods of heavy rain this month followed by a long period of drought next month, or if rain comes when it is not needed and does not come when it is needed, then the crops will suffer enormous damage. In business management, purchasing raw materials, selling goods, and daily wages are all inseparable from economics. If economic management is not properly handled, then there will be no ability to purchase raw materials when needed, and by the time the ability to purchase comes, the price will already be high. When sales are not necessary, one has to sacrifice painfully due to urgent need for funds, and when the goods are sold, the market price happens to rise, resulting in a decrease in the quantity of raw materials replenished. It can be seen that proper economic management can lead to ease and success from all directions, while improper management leads to hitting walls everywhere and failing step by step. Therefore, economic management can truly be said to be the most important key to the success of a business. And this is no different when it comes to the individual. Webster's Dictionary defines the word "Finance" (i.e., economic management) as "the science of managing property to generate profit." Since business management cannot abandon profitability, managers cannot be ignorant of this science.

At the same time, the connection between production and sales is also easy to explain. Before goods begin to be manufactured, the production department needs the sales department to provide reports on the general situation in the market, so that the goods produced can capture a reasonable market share. The sales department also needs the production department to provide information on all aspects of manufacturing, so as to know the advantages of the goods. If the sales department sees that the sales of goods can be expanded, then it can ask the production department to expand production. If the production department estimates that there is a way to obtain raw materials and that production can be increased, then it can ask the sales department to generate new sales channels in addition to the existing ones. In this way, through mutual cooperation, both sales and production can be confident. Add to this appropriate economic management methods, and the success of the business can naturally be assured.

In the past, during the War of Resistance, profits could be made simply by hoarding materials due to material shortages and currency devaluation. But this was ultimately a wartime phenomenon and not a proper way to run a business. After the victory, it is necessary to adapt to the times and develop equally in all three aspects. Because market competition is becoming increasingly fierce, good sales methods are needed not only to maintain existing business but also to expand future sales. If sales cannot be expanded, costs can never be reduced. At the beginning of construction, raw materials are not easy to purchase, the work of the production department is also quite laborious, and the turnover of funds, at a time when most manufacturers feel that capital is insufficient, requires even better management methods to make one dollar produce the effect of two dollars.

Thinking in broad terms, we want to get the wheels of the entire industrial and commercial sector turning. Speaking in smaller terms, we want to get the wheels of every industrial and commercial enterprise turning. The close connection and joint discussion of the three departments can be said to be the driving force behind the rotation of the industrial and commercial wheels.
