### Content of Sino-French New Treaty Negotiations; Foreign Minister Wang Will Go to Paris to Sign It Early

[Reuters, Paris, 20th] Well-informed sources expect that once Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie arrives in Paris, the new Sino-French treaty can be signed early, and the withdrawal of Chinese troops from northern Vietnam can be realized with the establishment of the treaty. Other issues still under discussion include: (1) extraterritoriality, with the French believing that they should retain their extraterritorial rights in China before the treaty is established; (2) the property rights of the French Catholic Church in China; (3) the establishment of a free port in Haiphong; (4) the transfer of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to China; and (5) the occupation fees for Chinese troops stationed in Vietnam.

It is reported that the French cabinet discussed the matter yesterday, and Colonial Minister Moutet reviewed the situation in Vietnam.

Lieutenant General Gillem, of the War Department, whereas Marshall represents President Truman and the State Department. Marshal Marshall is now preparing to depart for various parts of China for inspection.

[United Press, Washington, 19th] It was learned today from authoritative sources that the plan for the U.S. Military Advisory Group in China has been completed and has been approved by the highest military and political leaders. It is now only awaiting final approval from President Truman.

[United Press, Chongqing, 19th] Zhou Enlai has also flown back to Yan'an to confer with Mao Zedong. At the same time, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie consulted with Chairman Chiang in Nanjing yesterday after returning to Chongqing and then discussed matters with Chiang Ching-kuo and Zhang Jiaao. With all parties rushing around frequently, it can be seen that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are once again vying for control of the Northeast.

[United Press, Yan'an, 19th] Zhou Enlai returned here today to meet with Mao Zedong. Zhou was unwilling to comment on the mission of this trip, perhaps to discuss the situation in the Northeast. It is reported that the Chinese Communist Party requested negotiations with the government a week ago on the issue of local autonomy in the Northeast and recognition and reorganization of the 300,000 troops in the Northeast. It is said that Zhou Enlai will stay overnight and return to Chongqing tomorrow.

[United Press, Washington, 19th] Secretary of State Byrnes told the press today that the State Department has not yet obtained proof of the Soviet army's withdrawal from the Northeast. He said that the United States has asked China and the Soviet Union to notify Washington of the progress of negotiations regarding the Northeast, but the Chinese and Soviet governments have not yet replied. Secretary of State Byrnes expressed the hope that the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission in Korea could begin work in early March to deal with various economic and administrative issues. Regarding the division of Korea north and south at the 38th parallel, progress is only expected after the commission begins work. He also revealed that Acheson decided to return to Japan to assist General MacArthur with political issues.

[Central News Agency, New York, 19th, United Press] The New York Herald Tribune commented that the current situation in Northeast China disappoints those who hope that the United States and the Soviet Union will maintain good relations. The recent future development of the area will be a touchstone for the United States and the Soviet Union to establish friendly relations. Such a test may be a good thing. This test will give a clearer indication than the current facts as to whether the international cooperation agreed upon earlier for the Northeast region of Asia is a fact or merely high-sounding and meaningless words.

### This Year's National Defense Plan Decided; Implementing the Construction of the Air Force and Navy; Army Generals Leave Beijing and Return to Their Posts

[Report from This Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] Chongqing News: The decision of the military demobilization conference, this "elite soldiers policy," is not limited to the army. It is heard that this year's long-deliberated national defense plan also has timely decisions suitable for refining the air force and rebuilding the navy. In the future, the Chinese Air Force and the Navy's Qingdao. Judging from the measures currently taken by the government, the construction creed of the Chinese Air Force and Navy in the future will obviously emphasize quality over quantity. The fact that the Navy only sets up one place and does not mention setting up a department for the time being, and the air force units are becoming less and less, also illustrates that today, not only all construction of the Navy and Air Force of China must emphasize quality over quantity, but the same is true of the institutions themselves.

[Report from This Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] One-fifth of the generals who attended the military demobilization conference returned to their posts this morning. The generals remaining in Beijing visited the 74th Army stationed in the Beijing-Tianjin area to see field exercises today.

### Increasing Obstacles to Road Repair Work; Encountering Serious Tests; Communist Troops Busy Moving in Shandong Province

[Report from This Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th, Urgent Telegram] News from transportation circles indicates that road repair work is now encountering serious tests. Although the equipment, materials, and manpower to be used to repair the Jinpu and Jiaoji Railways have arrived at the work sections one after another, it is difficult to predict when the work will begin. According to engineering personnel who returned from supervising the repair of the railway north of Xuzhou, the obstacles to road repair have increased in the past three days, and it is heard that the Communist troops in Shandong Province are very busy moving, which seems to be related to the situation in the Northeast. Moreover, according to well-informed sources, if the repair work cannot proceed unhindered within the next five days, this matter may become a pie in the sky. The obstructors within the Lunan Military Region of the Communist Army are currently very interested in purchasing grain, and all other matters are dismissed as unknown.

[United Press, Peiping, 20th] According to today's Chinese newspapers, the National Army and the Communist Army clashed about five miles from Hedingnan on the Pinghan Railway. Chinese sources also said that there was also contact in Anyang in northern Henan. The Railway Supervision Team is scheduled to leave here today for Anyang to supervise the railway repair work in that province.

### Special Commentary: The Opening of Door Households and the Current Chinese Balance of Power

— Shi Zhigang

I. The Decline of a Strong Nation's Mission

Domestically, although political consultation has been declared successful, the hope of political parties cooperating in construction remains faint. Political instability leads to economic and social collapse. No measure can satisfy the people, and the authorities already feel overwhelmed. The clamor for democracy only increases disorder and does not promote real progress. Internal contradictions prevent China from following in the footsteps of Britain and the Soviet Union and immediately embarking on the road to revival. The attention of the entire nation is focused on the stability of domestic order, somewhat weakening attention to the infiltration of external forces. Amid the ebb and flow of international power, China has passively become the focus of world problems again. Although this victory has created a once-in-a-millennium opportunity for us, this opportunity is about to be "missed." To put it urgently, China is about to step into the position of a semi-colony again. Of course, China is one of the four powers in the United Nations, but China's ability to become a strong nation in victory is a "shameful victory." How is this so?

First, China won the war but lost sovereignty over Outer Mongolia. Although this is in line with the principles of nationalism and the Atlantic Charter's self-determination of nations, why must the Soviet Union and we conclude an alliance treaty stipulating this only today, after the victory? Among the victorious countries in World War II, only Poland and our country lost territory. What position do we place ourselves in? Second, allied countries have troops stationed in China. Although China is one of the four powers, it is too much like Iran and Greece in many ways. We relied on others to win the war, so other people's troops can be stationed in our country to assist in the surrender or delay withdrawal. Especially in the Northeast, the Soviet army repeatedly postponed its withdrawal. In this situation, what is the difference between the Russian army's unwillingness to withdraw after China's defeat in the Boxer Rebellion? Furthermore, Japan was defeated and therefore must be monitored and interfered with by foreign countries. However, in our victorious country, there is also a disguised struggle for rights and interests, allowing others to handle it. Although the names are different, it is actually the same as a defeated country. How can this be explained?

Not only the United States and the Soviet Union, whose national strength has expanded particularly after the war, are actively extending their influence to our country, but even the two imperialist countries, Britain and France, whose situation is as "miserable" as ours, are also intentionally or unintentionally attempting to restore their original appearance, fantasizing about prolonging their dim-witted dreams in this awakened land. The Kowloon Ping Shan Airport incident, the Shanghai Bairding incident, and the anti-Chinese tragedies performed in Malaya and Siam are enough to illustrate our judgment.

We can open the window from this chaotic house and look out at the world. The world outside China has clearly formed three divisions after this war – the newly emerging capitalist United States, the socialist Soviet Union, and the group of declining imperialist countries such as Britain and France. They are each relying on their own systems and forms, attempting to actively expand their influence and extend it as far as possible to any corner of the world. China may become an independent entity outside the three spheres of influence, or it may be absorbed by any one of them. This is the largest arena of competition. This is a re-enactment of the Warring States period in history.

This is a huge crisis. In the arena of national competition, our own strength is too weak, and our attention is focused on long-pending domestic problems. If we must start with clarifying internal rights and then extend to the world, then perhaps Korea will no longer be independent, Vietnam will fail to achieve autonomy, the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia will be almost completely excluded, and our own fate will have been "predetermined" by others.

In short, if everyone does not awaken and we remain in a dominated position, the fleeting "strong nation" destiny will inevitably decline!

II. The Extension of Soviet Influence to the East

埃, 里务 (Emery Reves) in his book "The Anatomy of Peace" once said this:

"The development path of Soviet foreign policy is exactly the same as that of other strong countries – alliances, spheres of influence, expediency and compromise when power is exhausted, and expansion after military victory. Communism is only a means for the Soviet Union to achieve this goal – a great nationalist goal...

After 1920, communism gradually decreased in importance, while nationalism continued to increase. In the early twenty-five years, although the Communist International was very ambitious, its influence failed to extend far beyond its borders. However, the totalitarian Soviet national state followed. Even the Communist parties in foreign countries, which were indeed encouraged by Moscow, have set aside their struggle to socialize their own countries and gradually become tools of Soviet nationalist policy. Their attitude is not based on the need to establish communism, but on the need to enhance the international position of the Soviet Union."

Interpreted in this way, why is there an Eastern European country group? Why does Turkey want to reaffirm its position? Why does Iran want to request UN mediation? All are obvious.

This turmoil and disturbance is not only seen in the neighboring countries on the western border of the Soviet Union, but also in China, the eastern neighbor of the Soviet Union. In addition to the matters stipulated in last year's Sino-Soviet Alliance Treaty, the shadow of the Soviet Union is flashing all over our Northeast and Northwest. Approximately as follows:

1. The Yining Incident: After the Kazakh national riots last year, the Chongqing government sent personnel to pacify and negotiate, allowing a high degree of autonomy. Recently, there have been rumors that the "East Turkestan Republic" is stirring up trouble again.

2. The Outer Mongolian Tangnu Ulianghai region was incorporated into the Soviet Union and renamed "Tannu Tuva Province," which was not decided by a referendum of Outer Mongolian citizens.

3. Autonomous regimes have emerged in Inner Mongolia and the Xing'an Mountains area of the Northeast.

4. There are new economic negotiations on the Northeast issue.

The above are all based on recent reports, and the so-called legal treaty provisions are still outside. These include—

1. In the Sino-Soviet Agreement, China recognizes the independence of Outer Mongolia. China and the Soviet Union jointly manage the Chinese Changchun Railway, and the Lushun Military Port is jointly used by China and the Soviet Union and defended by the Soviet Union. Dalian becomes a free city.

2. In the Yalta Agreement, in addition to the Chinese side, the Soviet Union also occupies the Kuril Islands and Southern Sakhalin.

3. According to the UN decision, Korea is under trusteeship for five years. Soviet troops are stationed in northern Korea. In summary, the Soviet Union's gains in East Asia have been quite substantial. No wonder the Americans are jealous, pointing out that the Soviet Union has restored the rights of the Tsarist era.

According to unconfirmed news, the Soviet Union has even demanded to demarcate the area along the Chinese Changchun Railway as a "security corridor." At the same time, the Jinzhou Northeast Headquarters will be established. It seems that Liaodong will become the division between the two major forces of China and the Soviet Union. If this trend cannot be reversed, what is the difference between this and the inability to recover the Sixteen Prefectures of Yanyun after the Liao Dynasty was destroyed in the Five Dynasties period?

We can prove from this point that what 埃. 里务 said does have its reasons.

We cannot solely blame the British and Americans for the betrayal policy in the Altai Agreement. The Soviet Union can demand the restoration of the rights of the Tsarist era, so why can't we, who are also a victorious country, restore all the rights we lost before the Qing Dynasty? In short, "weak countries have no diplomacy" is a fact. Taking a step back, if we compare the gains and losses of China in this war with those of Turkey in the Crimean War or Italy in World War I, then it may not be possible to comfort ourselves with "better than nothing."

Regarding the current situation in the Northeast, as the Americans say, it is as thorny as the Shandong issue after World War I. The Soviet Union is too much like Japan. The Soviet Union has completely and flawlessly inherited Tsarist Russia. Let's see how Tsarist Russia treated China. It always received some unearned gains whenever China could. During the Anglo-French War, the Qing Emperor fled Beijing and formed a humiliating alliance with Britain and France; the Russian envoy Igniatiev mediated peace, and as a result, Russia obtained the land of the Sixty-Four Villages East of the River. During the Shaanxi-Gansu Hui Rebellion, Russia even came forward to negotiate, and as a result, China lost the area along the lower reaches of the Ili River. In the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, China ceded the Liaodong Peninsula, which was intervened and recovered by Russia, Germany, and France. As a result, the Sino-Russian secret treaty was established, creating the historical basis for the various conditions of this Sino-Soviet military alliance agreement. Although the Soviet Union once solemnly declared its abandonment, it went back on its word in the Yalta Agreement and demanded inheritance! At that time, Tsarist Russia even encouraged Germany and France to occupy Jiaozhou and Guangzhou Bay respectively, forming a crisis in which the Qing Dynasty was almost divided by the great powers. During the Xinhai Revolution, Russia instigated the independence of Outer Mongolia's Zhangjia Hutuktu. There are countless examples of this.

In this Sino-Soviet military alliance agreement, the two signatory countries, China and the Soviet Union, are the cornerstones of the stable democratic camp. This agreement is sufficient to ensure the stability of the Pacific West Coast order; its contribution is great, and there is no need for much speculation. However, speculating from the recent rumors of new negotiations makes people increasingly reminiscent of the past history and have a cautious feeling.

Furthermore, try to observe the history of Japanese aggression against China since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, such as: encouraging ethnic minorities, creating vassal regimes, actively plotting division; massacring responsible personnel (such as martyr Cai Gongshi), disregarding Chinese sovereignty; and raising remnants of the fallen Qing Dynasty, harboring evil intentions, etc. There are so many tricks that it is difficult to hide them from the world. The Japanese bandits made every effort to weaken China and facilitate their own expansion, which is indeed the act of an aggressor. After this war, the aggressive forces have been almost completely eliminated. We hope that any country can take Japan as a lesson and no longer fantasize about infringing upon the sovereignty of the Republic of China. (To be continued)

### Secrets of Atomic Bomb Manufacturing Still Held in American Hands Canada Decides to Purge Domestic Traitors Investigation of Espionage Cases Continues, Suspects Arrested

[United Press Washington, 19th] U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes told the press today: The secret knowledge of manufacturing atomic bombs is still being kept by the U.S. government. This secret has not been detected by any international spies in Canada. Regarding the atomic bomb information shared by the U.S., Britain, and Canada, Byrnes made another formal statement, stating that neither the British nor Canadian governments know the secrets of atomic bomb manufacturing, let alone other countries. He claimed that the Canadian spy case elements did not deploy in the United States, and no U.S. citizens are involved in the case. He also claimed that he has no reason to arrest any suspects in the U.S. He does not believe that Major General Groves, director of the atomic bomb laboratory, ever said that some secrets of the atomic bomb had been leaked. Byrnes said that he had recently met with Groves, and Groves never said such a thing. If it is as rumored that Soviet secret personnel stole a suitcase full of espionage case documents and were able to leave the U.S. port, he would be very surprised.

[United Press Washington, 19th] Today's "Toronto Star" reported that Canada will require all Soviet agents related to espionage to leave Canada. "Canada will insist on a total cleansing of the personnel of the Soviet Embassy and demand that measures be taken to ensure that the movement to detect Canada's military and scientific secrets does not happen again." Montreal magazine today accused the Soviet Union, "The Soviet Union's plan to dump 125,000 pounds worth of black market uranium on the Canadian market has been discovered."

[Agence France-Presse Ottawa, 20th] The case of leaking atomic bomb secrets is still shrouded in mystery. The cabinet met yesterday, but no statement was issued afterwards. According to the authorities, the government's primary goal is to purge domestic traitors. It is said that there are more than a dozen major traitors among the arrested suspects, some of whom are engaged in fraud, and a few are professional spies.

[Associated Press Ottawa, 20th] The Canadian government announced today that regarding the "atomic espionage network," the government is prepared to issue further announcements to clarify indiscriminate rumors. The cabinet is quite uneasy about the worldwide attention to this case and the outside world's unfounded suspicions, and is eager to pay attention to government officials suspected of leaking secrets, knowing that some of them hold extremely high positions.

[Agence France-Presse London, 19th] According to today's Star Evening News, the intelligence department of the British Army Ministry is conducting an investigation into the Canadian atomic secret leak case and is currently conducting searches in the London area and the southern counties where Canadian troops are stationed.

### Limited Number of Visitors to US Atomic Bomb Test About 200 Reporters

[Agence France-Presse Washington, 20th] Secretary of State Byrnes said at a press conference yesterday: When the US Navy conducts atomic bomb tests in May and June, the only foreigners allowed to visit will be representatives of the UN Atomic Energy Commission. The representatives of the committee include China, Britain, France, the Soviet Union, Canada, Australia, Egypt, the Netherlands, and Mexico in addition to the United States.

[Associated Press Chicago, 20th] Navy Public Information Director Miller told the Inland Daily Newspaper Association that the atomic bomb test in the Pacific may be broadcast to the world like a play, and about 200 newspaper reporters will be allowed to visit the experiment on ships 8 to 10 miles away. There are 19 ships used as targets and 150 ships around the perimeter.

### UK Officials' Mission to India is Important, Seeking Solutions from Indians to Open the Way for India's Constitutional Government

[Reuters London, 20th] Three key members of the British cabinet are scheduled to fly to India at the end of next month to make the greatest efforts to open up constitutional solutions. A government spokesman said that the success of this mission is of great importance not only to India and the British Commonwealth, but also to world peace. The three cabinet members are Secretary of State for India Lawrence, Secretary of Commerce Cripps, and Secretary of the Navy Alexander. According to Lawrence, this proposal has been fully agreed to by Indian Governor Wavell, and the future of 400 million people will be determined by this. The three ministers have broad powers for this trip and will actually represent the British cabinet in India. Their research matters are not limited to Cripps' proposals, but will seek the best way to deal with the situation from the Indians themselves. The most important thing is to establish a constitutional body. Britain recognizes that constitutionalism is the task of the Indians themselves, and Britain only intends to assist them in reaching a consensus. The time the delegation stays in India is not limited, and the negotiation situation will depend on the local environment. They will listen to the opinions of all parties in India as much as possible, and do not carry specific suggestions on this trip. They can only decide on a plan that is most suitable for India after referring to the opinions of the Indians.

### Another Example of Nazi Atrocities Soap Made from Human Fat

Institutes specially designed for this were quite interested!

[Associated Press Nuremberg, 19th] Soviet prosecutors announced in the international court today the details of how Nazi Germans extracted oil from the bodies of victims in a special factory in Danzig and made soap. When a German assistant testified that he had helped boil the bodies and used the soap, many people turned pale. The assistant said that in the summer of 1943, a building was completed in the Danzig Anatomy Institute, named "Human Skeletal Product Experiment Institute." In January of the following year, it began to make soap from human fat. The human raw materials were supplied by a mental hospital, which routinely terminated the lives of those who were physically and mentally unsound. Later, 400 headless corpses were obtained from the Konigsberg prison. The Nazis had a guillotine in the prison. Nazi officials and scientists were very interested in this soap-making experiment, and many people went to the experimental institute to visit. Dr. Conti, who once served as the Nazi Minister of Health, was one of them. Conti has committed suicide in Nuremberg. The assistant also confessed that he had personally boiled the oil from 40 male and female corpses, obtaining 7,280 kilograms, and had used as much as 4 kilograms of this human fat soap for cosmetics and washing.

The matter was discovered by the company, and he was transferred to the military headquarters. Subsequently, the military headquarters received orders from Suzhou, and the soldier was escorted to Suzhou along with the army.

Changzhou

Drug Trafficking Fugitive Arrested and Sent to Beijing

Izo Sakubei, 30 years old, from Niigata Prefecture, Japan, previously came to China with the invading Japanese army and had been here for five or six years. He served as the captain of the enemy police guard team in Wutang, Changzhou. In addition to wantonly harming our compatriots, he colluded with Chinese traitors and vagrants to sell opium, heroin, and other drugs on a large scale. After his military service expired, he was reassigned as a ticket inspector on inland riverboats. Using his brutal methods, he mistreated passengers, accumulating a large sum of money, which he lent to civilians at high interest rates. In August of last year, when the Japanese surrendered, Izo Sakubei, because of his fluency in Chinese, was able to hide more easily and was not discovered and sent to a concentration camp. However, his loans became uncollectible, and he gradually became impoverished. He gave three privately hidden handguns to a Mr. Jia in Wutang, allowing him to hide in the countryside for a long time. Recently, Mr. Jia, fearing that the fugitive's whereabouts would be exposed and implicate him, transported him by boat to the countryside of Liyang. He was eventually discovered by the Changzhou garrison and arrested, and evidence of his crimes was collected and sent to Beijing for investigation.

### Investigation of Household Registration in the City - Mobilizing Over 26,000 People

Estimated Expenses Exceed 10 Million Yuan - If Not Completed Within a Week, It May Be Extended

[Our Report] The Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau began investigating household registration throughout the city some days ago and originally planned to complete the task within a week. It has been learned that, to facilitate procedures for citizens, the effort may be extended by one or two days. The investigation will result in precise and detailed statistics. Currently, approximately 70 people are being trained to carry out this work, and the results are expected to be published in early March. This investigation involves the mobilization of over 26,000 people each day, with an estimated cost exceeding 10 million yuan. According to officials from the Civil Affairs Bureau yesterday, the investigation has been proceeding smoothly. However, there have been some misunderstandings regarding this effort. The Baobaojia system was promulgated in our country in the 18th year of the Republic of China. The enemy and puppets stole our inherent good system to carry out their governing agenda and plunder the people's food and private property. Therefore, the nature is fundamentally different. Moreover, investigating household registration is necessary for any country, whether for educational, economic, or social reasons. It is hoped that citizens will understand the true meaning and cooperate with the government.

### High Court Held Hearing Yesterday - Interrogation of Former Puppet Prison Warden - Lei Midi Di, Si Xue Er Fa and Xi Bao Xiong and Three Other Criminals Summoned on the Same Day

[Our Report] The former puppet Shanghai Prison Warden, Shen Guanquan, transferred 850 prisoners from the prison to Zhoushan Islands and other places to assist the enemy in constructing defensive fortifications. Due to the unbearable torture, 60 to 70 of these prisoners died one after another. Those who survived were mostly unrecognizable. During his tenure, Shen also stole and sold a large number of paper, white cloth, scrap copper, gray felt, and other items stored in the prison, which were worth tens of millions of yuan in puppet currency at the time. After the victory, he was reported by Chen Weifan, a senior official who had left the prison. After an investigation by the High Procuratorate, he was prosecuted by the High Court in accordance with Article 2, Paragraph 1, Sections 1 and 4 of the Regulations for Punishing Traitors. Several other people were also implicated, including Xu Quanyuan, the head of the prison's work section; Shen Guanrong, the deputy head of the work section; and Zhang Xuemei, the deputy head of the general affairs section. Shen and Zhang are currently on the run, Xu has been released on bail, and Shen Guanquan is in custody. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Cao interrogated Shen Guanquan in the criminal court of the Tilanqiao High Court. Shen Guanquan stated that the Japanese initially requested the transfer of 1,200 prisoners, with orders from the puppet Shanghai Municipal Government and the puppet Shanghai High Court Procuratorate. The Japanese also sent trucks to force the loading of prisoners, so there was no way to refuse. In the end, a total of 850 people were transported. As for the sale of items, it was due to a lack of funds and was approved by Wu Songbi, the Minister of Puppet Judicial Administration at the time. The proceeds that were not accounted for were used to provide for underground workers and political prisoners imprisoned in the prison and to provide them with travel expenses after their release. In addition, they were used to establish an obligation school, so he was also an underground worker. Subsequently, the court interrogated Xu Quanyuan. The lawyer hired by the defendant presented various pieces of evidence and requested that the court summon Ai Guofan and Wan Molin, and five others who were responsible for underground work in Shanghai at the time, to testify. The court ruled that the court would deliberate and decide. The accuser, Chen Weifan, was absent. The case was adjourned for further hearing. Shen Guanquan was returned to custody.

Yesterday morning, Judge Cai also interrogated the Portuguese national Lei Midi Di, Si Xue Er Fa, and the Hungarian national Xi Bao Xiong, who were accused of purchasing a large amount of gasoline, alcohol, and other supplies for the enemy for military use. The defendants hired lawyer Tang Huaiqun to defend them. After investigation, the court ruled that the hearing be adjourned for further investigation.

### Cotton and Wool Textile Workers Go on Strike Again - Social Affairs Bureau Continues to Mediate

### Continued Trial of War Criminals on the 18th - Decision to Extend the Formal Sentencing

The Japanese Commander Continues to Feign Ignorance

The American Military Tribunal began trying eighteen Japanese war criminals at the beginning of this month and has now reached its third week. Originally, the formal sentencing was scheduled for yesterday, but because various testimonies and arguments have not been completed, the sentencing date will be changed to this Saturday. The defendant's defense lawyer, Hawkins, seems to be trying to absolve each offender of guilt or at least reduce their sentences, but the plaintiff's defense lawyer, Webster, is also striving to seek justice for the deceased. As a result, a war of words breaks out in the court from time to time, putting the five presiding judges in a difficult position. Hawkins cited two points in an attempt to win the case: (1) Each offender had to follow orders from superiors and act against their own will in order to fulfill their military duties. (2) To overturn each offender's original confession, so that they could shift the blame to others. Yesterday, the court successively summoned Major General Kabumoto Masao, Commander of the Japanese 34th Army; Colonel Fukumoto Kameji; and Major Sakai Sadaji to appear in court to extract confessions. These three people were extremely cunning, sometimes saying "I don't remember," sometimes saying "I don't know," and sometimes saying "I didn't do this." But judging from the appearances of the three, they were not confused or forgetful people. Yesterday morning, Lieutenant Colonel Hawkins asked Matsumoto Satoru, who had just arrived, about the importance of orders in the Japanese army during wartime. Matsumoto Satoru said that it was equal to the Emperor's order, because Hawkins wanted to reduce the guilt of each offender from the point of obeying orders. Then, Colonel Fukumoto Kameji, Commander of the Garrison in Hankou, was summoned. This man was 52 years old, with graying hair, and claimed that he did not agree with the parade and only dispatched the garrison to cooperate on orders. The reasons for dispatching the garrison to cooperate were threefold: (1) to protect American pilots, (2) to prevent them from escaping or committing suicide, and (3) military orders are like mountains and cannot be violated. At this time, Lieutenant Colonel Webster produced his confession and asked to explain the meaning of "punishment." Fukumoto firmly denied participating in the action and cited the words of Tadano Masayoshi, Commander of the 34th Army, and Hattori Moriji, Commander of the Garrison: "You don't have to worry, I will take care of everything." Asked if he knew that what he was doing violated international law and humanity, Fukumoto said, "I know, so I don't agree." At this point, the judge left the courtroom. Fukumoto Osamu was summoned again in the afternoon, and he still pretended to be confused, repeatedly shaking his head and saying, "I don't know." The judge then summoned Major Sakai Sadaji. Sakai Sadaji was 50 years old, came from a farming family, and had served in the army for 30 years. He had a wife, one son, and six daughters. It is said that after the murder of the American pilots occurred, he learned of the situation from a report from Lieutenant Izumi Takeshi (who is on the run). At the time, the Japanese army thought that they could use this parade opportunity to publicize it widely and falsely claim that the Japanese had shot down an American plane, and at the same time quell the anger of the people in Hankou. He had discussed this with Fukumoto Kameji at the time, and Fukumoto said that he was afraid there would be trouble, but since it was an order, he had to execute it, "I have no way to help it." Lieutenant Colonel Webster asked, "Did you send the person who participated in the killing of the American pilots?" He replied, "Yes, but I only designated one person and did not specify who to send." So Lieutenant Colonel Webster read out a part of his confession. The offender countered that the confession had some errors. Then, because of the difference in the meaning of the words "punishing war criminals" and "insulting war criminals," the translator had to spend half an hour looking up dictionaries. Sakai Sadaji also did not admit to signing the order paper. His confession was largely the same as the above two. Yesterday took five hours, but to no avail.

### China Tobacco Company - Three Factories Start Production

Monthly Output of 5,000 Large Cases of Cigarettes

[Our Report] The China Tobacco Company, an enemy asset taken over by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, has had its first, second, and third factories start production since resuming work on the 11th of last month. The three factories have a total of 65 cigarette machines, most of which are now in operation, and can produce 5,000 large cases of cigarettes per month. It is reported that there are no difficulties in obtaining raw materials at present. Recently, a large shipment of tobacco leaves is expected to arrive from Qingdao. All of the cigarette factories taken over by the Tobacco Group of the former Ministry of Economic Affairs, except for those that were auctioned off and returned to their owners, will be operated by the company. The company's organizational and operational charter has been drafted and is awaiting review and approval by the relevant authorities. The nature of the company is roughly similar to that of the China Textile Construction Company and the China Silk Company. The company's operating period is set for two years. When the deadline expires, the company will issue shares to facilitate the transfer to private operation. Currently, before the board of directors is formed, the position of general manager will be temporarily filled by Yang Xiren, designated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs.

Chinese Tobacco Factories Preparing to Resume Work

According to the person in charge of the local Chinese Tobacco Factory Association, a total of 65 Chinese tobacco factories in the city have registered as members. In reality, more than 30 factories are in production. Large factories such as Huacheng and Nanyang are preparing to resume work. Although the current stock of raw materials for cigarettes, such as tobacco leaves and paper wrappers, is still sufficient, the source is not yet fully smooth. Moreover, the ad valorem tax on cigarettes is a heavy burden, so it is hoped that Chinese tobacco factories will do their best to rely on their own efforts to strengthen the position of Chinese cigarettes.

However, it is still doubtful whether there are any surplus military supplies in East China and the Shanghai region.

Bidders in this city will still be given the opportunity to purchase surplus goods from various American military outposts in the Pacific region. The commission has already obtained one return flight and will soon obtain another to transport bidders to various locations to

Inspect the Surplus Goods on Site

to clarify the situation. It is reported that the commission is being very careful in selling surplus goods in this city. The background of each bidder and their relationships with all parties will be reviewed. The commission reserves the right to refuse to sell any surplus goods and stated that "the US government does not intend to engage in retail or wholesale business, nor does it intend to provide 'profiteers' with huge profits." The

Overall Goal

of handling American military surplus goods in China is to assist in relief and rehabilitation work. Therefore, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is the largest customer for American surplus goods. UNRRA has already obtained a large number of surplus goods, especially trucks and building materials. UNRRA will also absorb a large amount of American military surplus food. Currently, various sectors in this city are applying for various

Vehicles, Primarily

Jeeps. However, according to one observer, most of the bidders are merchants who intend to use these surplus goods as a substitute for imported goods from the United States. However, it is predicted that the bidders' hopes of obtaining surplus goods are slim. It is reported that the commission will

Categorize and Price

various surplus goods according to their location, type, and condition, and then publicly solicit bids. Within a certain period, tenderers are required to submit a tender together with a bid bond of 10%. All tenderers will be invited to attend the bid opening. Before accepting a bid, the commission will give comprehensive consideration to the bidder. For special reasons, even the person who bids the highest price may have their bid rejected. It has also been reported that a batch of surplus transport aircraft has recently been

Sold to UNRRA

, China National Aviation Corporation, and Central Air Transport Corporation. Currently, the commission divides bidders into three categories: UNRRA has the highest priority for certain major surplus goods, followed by the Chinese government. Bidders in this city are classified into the third category, "Others."

Commercial News

### Mobile Market Transactions Lead to Simultaneous Rebound in Gold and Paper Money. Document Folders and Coupons are Not Traded Publicly. Chinese Stocks are Quoted at a Premium.

Due to the easing of credit yesterday, buying sentiment increased, and transactions moved to the Sichuan Road area due to inconveniences caused by authorities inspecting the Securities Exchange Building. Trading was conducted secretly. Early morning trading showed slight improvement, reaching 1.42 million. Trading was extremely difficult, and even small transactions were prone to fluctuations. The price once fell from 1.45 million to 1.40 million. However, the international situation stimulated sentiment, and the easing of credit further fueled buying activity. The afternoon closing rebounded to above 1.45 million, an increase of 50% compared to the previous close. Scattered buying continued in the afternoon, with bids rising to around 1.50 million, and the trend was quite firm. Ornaments were still not listed. Sycee silver was around 1600, and silver dollars were around 800 yuan. Interest rates continued to ease, with daily interest rates at 15% to 20%.

The price of US dollars followed the gold market's ups and downs, initially hovering around 2000 yuan. Hundred-dollar bills were refused for delivery, and buyers had difficulty obtaining chips. The price gradually strengthened from around 1980 yuan. As the gold market improved, the price above 2000 yuan became stable. The price finally rose to around 2050 yuan, an increase of 60 yuan compared to the previous close. Old Hong Kong dollars were quoted at 37 times the Shanghai dollar in Hong Kong, with a 79% exchange rate. There were fewer sellers than buyers at around 330 yuan. Hong Kong telegraphic transfers were above 340 yuan, and new notes were between 80 and 85 yuan, all showing slight declines.

There were no gatherings for government bonds or Chinese and foreign stocks. Private transactions were conducted based on the actual needs of both parties. Initially, government bonds hovered around the previous closing price, but finally rebounded slightly. Chinese stocks were slightly higher than the previous closing price, with some matched trades. Foreign stocks were all offered at prices below the previous closing price, with few buyers and no sellers.

### Yarn Sales Improve

The yarn market turned onto a smooth path yesterday as sales improved and purchasing was strong. 20-count Double Horse yarn once again exceeded the million-dollar mark, while Blue Phoenix and Golden Bridge also exceeded 900,000. Confidence was strengthened as a result, and the trend was quite stable.

### Scattered Transactions in Spot Cotton

Spot cotton transactions were less active yesterday, likely due to tight credit and the Shanghai Textile Construction Company's sudden wait-and-see attitude. Transactions included over one hundred pieces of imported cotton, Midlin, and Fire Engine brand Zhoupu cottonseeds.

### Good Sales of Woolen Fabrics

Woolen fabric transactions saw significant progress yesterday. Western clothing tailors from various districts in this city, as well as tailors from Nanjing and Hangzhou, had strong demand. Most transactions were for single pieces or boxes, as, under today's high prices, most only sought to match various colors. Only one or two out of ten could afford to purchase entire boxes or bolts of woolen fabric. It was also reported that the Shanghai Textile Construction Company had released a batch of woolen fabrics yesterday.

### Weak Cotton Cloth

The cotton cloth market was quiet, and buyers remained hesitant. In addition, the China Textile Construction Company continued to supply and sell cotton cloth as a precursor to suppressing market prices, so the cloth market was unable to rise.

### Silk Market Initially Weak, Then Strong

The silk market was stable. It opened slightly lower in the morning, but as factory costs had not decreased, traders bought on the cheap, and the market trend initially weakened but then strengthened. Meiya bed sheets opened at 1.09 million and were sold out, closing at 1.1 million bid. Dacheng Bi crepe rose from 3740 yuan to 3830 yuan. The afternoon trend was uniformly upward, and the silk market was firm. Based on current market prices, they were still insufficient to cover production costs, and the market generally expected higher prices.

### Hundreds of Boxes of Chinese Tea to be Shipped to the United States Soon

[Our Newspaper's Report] It has been several years since the export of Chinese tea from this city ceased. Currently, there is strong demand in Europe and the United States. According to reporter investigations, recently, New York and other places plan to order several hundred tons of black tea, pearl tea, Gongxi tea, and other green teas from a tea merchant in this city. However, the tea merchant in this city, considering the depleted inventory in Shanghai and the fact that the new tea season is still far away, is finding it difficult to make a decision and remains hesitant. However, it is said that several hundred boxes will be shipped to the United States within days to meet the urgent overseas demand.

### Stable Trend in Black Tea

The trend in black tea, which had been weakening for several days, has stabilized. This is partly because distress sales from small holders due to tight credit have become scarce, and large holders are maintaining prices. Therefore, although buying demand is small, the market atmosphere is still stable. The results are largely unchanged compared to the previous day. As for green tea, under the influence of concentrated demand, sentiment remains strong, and transaction prices for all goods are very optimistic.

### Reduced Supply, Strong Demand, Rice Prices Rise Again

The rice market is very active, with a limited supply and more demand than supply. Prices have risen by more than 2,000 yuan again. Flour has also increased by 300-600 yuan. Soybeans remain stable. The oil market is stable with a continued supply from Qingdao, and prices are temporarily unchanged. Soybean cakes have risen by 100-200 yuan, bran is strong, and raw peanuts have increased slightly.

### Lumber Sales are Robust

The lumber market has been thriving recently, with robust sales to other ports and within this city. As a result, the price of foreign pine building materials is strong, and the price of Lauan plywood is also rising steadily. It is reported that small-scale plywood is being sold in this city, currently priced at 320 yuan per square foot, produced by Taichang.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Sugar prices have fallen due to the goods tax, making it difficult to transport goods.

Northern and Southern goods: Melon seeds remain strong, black dates are firm, and longan are declining rapidly.

Various brands of soap and Beautiful Phoenix matches are selling well and have risen in price. Wax candles are firm in price due to limited sales in northern Jiangsu.

Cigarettes: Front Door cigarettes are selling well and are strong, while transactions in older brands of factory cigarettes are being negotiated downwards.

### New Women's "Re-Departure"!

— Bao Shixi

In the epoch-making sound of national construction, new women should move in step; "re-depart" towards the construction road of a great era!

The "women's movement" of the past failed:

(1) In terms of psychology: Loss of confidence. Reliance on blind obedience. Hypocrisy and self-deception. Existence of passive psychology.

(2) In terms of ethics: No lofty concept of "self-cultivation, family management, national governance". No virtues of "valuing propriety, emphasizing righteousness, being honest and knowing shame". Failing to encourage men to "devote their loyalty to the country and their filial piety to the nation". Failing to be "public-spirited and disregarding self-interest, prioritizing the nation and forgetting the family".

(3) In terms of society: Not seeking social "modernization". Lacking cooperation. Not working towards the realization of a "new society". Not going deep into rural areas. Not focusing on rebuilding the grassroots work of the country.

(4) In terms of politics: Not striving based on the needs of the country and the trend of the times. Lacking clear and ambitious goals. Lacking lofty aspirations—not aspiring to serve on the frontier, not devoting themselves to political construction, not taking serving the country and saving the people as their ambition.

(5) In terms of economics: Lacking a simple and frugal life; indulging in the drunken dreams of the "Ten Miles Foreign Concession". Not "self-reliant". Lacking technical knowledge. Not engaging in the development of agriculture, industry, and commerce. Not seeking practical work. Not seeking creation. Not seeking invention. Not aspiring to be technical personnel or engineers. Not planning for "mass enjoyment".

The past has become "yesterday's flowers", there is no need to miss it, nor is there any need to be sad. I only hope that the "new life" will begin from now on.

Eastern "weak and frail," "capable of dancing in the palm of one's hand," "sleeping beauties," arise! The great wheel of the times has entered the age of atomic threats, and no longer allows you to sleep sweetly! No longer allows you to "parasitize." Lift your feet, move in step, be bold, challenge traditional thinking! March towards the road of construction!

Let us unfold the majestic posture of the "New Women's Movement" and "re-depart"!

First, eliminate the psychology of reliance and blind obedience, do not seek vanity, do not pursue luxury, do not live a romantic life. Demand practical learning, overthrow the outdated idea that "a woman without talent is virtuous"; a policy of keeping the people ignorant! Focus on reading, cultivate yourself, and bury yourself in research. Completely wash away the passive psychology of the past. Practice a simple and frugal new life.

Second, dedicate yourself to social work and strive for the realization of an ideal "new society." Strive for social "modernization." Advocate for the cooperative movement. Practice the grassroots work of national construction; go deep into rural areas, enlighten the illiterate, relieve the poor and weak, and seek the welfare of the people.

Third, new women should be "self-reliant." Use their hands and brains. Aspire to be teachers, mechanics, engineers, pilots, doctors, pharmacists, nurses, and political participants. Devote themselves to social education and cultural work, devote themselves to scientific research work, and seek new developments in agriculture, industry, and commerce.

Fourth, you must aspire to do great things, but do not seek to become high officials. Set ambitious goals, take serving the country and saving the people as your lifelong ambition, strive for women's suffrage, and seek the spiritual and physical liberation of women! Strive for the "freedom, equality, and happiness" of mankind. Cultivate the bright and beautiful flowers of the future world.

From now on, new women are no longer "powerless" and "brainless" "illiterate" figures, but rather women who are physically and mentally healthy, with practical learning, skills, and progressive thinking. To their children, they are not only "good mothers," but should also be "wise teachers"; not "blindly indulging," but "gently guiding" and teaching effectively. To their husbands, they are not only "virtuous wives," but often revolutionary "good helpmates"; not "assisting the wicked"—lacking the virtues of "honesty and shame," lacking the "faith of national construction," lacking the "morality of saving the country." Rather, they must provide spiritual encouragement; not engaging in self-interest or corruption; devoting all their loyalty to the country and their great filial piety to the nation.

### Landlords and Tenants Should Cooperate and Work Together

— Li

At present, there is a great shortage of housing in Shanghai. Many people who come from the interior cannot find housing for a while and are staying in hotels. Shanghai is experiencing a housing shortage, which naturally has its reasons. One reason is that the houses that were destroyed during the war have not been rebuilt; another reason is that the population of Shanghai is increasing day by day, but the construction of houses has not increased.

However, there are also many people who are taking advantage of the housing shortage to profit. In general, second landlords rent out part of their houses and demand exorbitant key money. There are also cases where they use the excuse that the contract has expired to take back the house for their own use, leading to disputes with subtenants, which are heard of every day.

Originally, the second landlords of Shanghai have a special face (naturally there are also good second landlords). When renting out houses, they are absolutely welcome to subtenants, but after living together for a period of time, they either restrict electricity today or restrict tap water tomorrow. The relationship between the second landlord and the subtenant becomes incompatible, which greatly hinders the construction of social order and the improvement of family life.

Second landlords should recognize that everything has not yet returned to normal. Even in the United States, there is a housing shortage, and it is not easy to build the necessary houses. They are also trying their best to come up with solutions based on reality: (1) Use existing movable temporary houses that are uninhabited, (2) Use abandoned but well-built residences, (3) Convert large residences and office buildings. We must also deal with the current difficulties together according to the current environment. Second landlords and subtenants should cooperate and work together and cannot be in an antagonistic position.

In today's world, a country cannot survive alone without other countries, and individual families can no longer "sweep the snow in front of their own doors" but should cooperate with each other.

Physiology

### Melancholy

— Tracing the Cause

In a hospital room with windows on three sides, a girl lay quietly on a bed near the south window. Her face was dim, her brows lightly furrowed. Although a young woman just coming into her prime, she had lost the inherent charm of a maiden. Her pair of sorrowful eyes were staring blankly at a row of treetops outside the west window, bathed in the last rays of the autumn sun.

"Why hasn't Doctor Yu come this morning? I have something to say, but he just won't come. It's five o'clock now, isn't it? Maybe Doctor Liu will come soon. I'll tell him."

There was a burst of talking, followed by hurried and heavy footsteps on the stairs. Her heart pounding, she hurriedly tidied her collar and disheveled hair. At this moment, the burly figure of Doctor Liu, the hospital director, appeared before her.

"Good morning, Doctor Liu!"

Doctor Liu stood outside the threshold, nodding slightly. "Miss Shen, are you feeling well?"

In the past, she always answered as usual: "Yes, I am." But today, she hesitated. She couldn't say "yes," but she couldn't say "no" either. She saw that Doctor Liu looked particularly rushed today, not even stepping into the room. She almost decided not to say what she had prepared, thinking, "I'll tell him another day." But Doctor Liu, seeing her hesitant expression, stepped inside. Nurse Miss Lin followed closely behind, walking to her bedside and trying to smooth out the crumpled blanket at the foot of the bed. But Miss Shen pulled the blanket away from her feet.

"Doctor Liu, please take a look at this right foot. Yesterday, when my mother came to wipe my feet, she noticed that the calf and knee of this foot were swollen!"

Doctor Liu calmly bent down to press and knead her leg and knee for a while, then looked at her face. "This isn't swelling, it's just fat! Isn't your face fatter too?"

"Oh, I don't think so! My mother said this left foot is thin and slender."

Doctor Liu pressed and compared her left foot. "About the same." Then he turned to Miss Lin and said, "Test the urine." He smoothed the blanket over Miss Shen's feet and said, "It's nothing, don't worry," before hurrying out. She watched Doctor Liu's back, full of suspicion.

At nine o'clock in the morning, Vice President Doctor Yu routinely inspected each ward. When he and Nurse Miss Zhu walked into Miss Shen's room, they noticed the deep melancholy hidden between Miss Shen's brows as she gazed at them.

"Good morning, Doctor Yu! Why didn't you come yesterday?"

"I went to Hangzhou for a consultation. Is there anything you need?"

Her face turned red, and she stammered, "Yesterday Doctor Liu asked for a urine test. It just so happens... it just so happens my period came. I don't know if it's okay to test?"

Nurse Miss Zhu, standing next to her, suddenly covered her nose and rushed out of the room when she heard her words. She was so embarrassed that she wanted to disappear. Her originally pale face was now as red as the sunset. She said anxiously:

"I asked Miss Lin if it was okay to test, and she said she didn't know and told me to ask you."

"You can't test. Why do you need a urine test?" Doctor Yu asked calmly.

"Because of the leg swelling." Her nervousness lessened as she uncovered the blanket from her feet.

Doctor Yu kneaded and examined her leg. "It's not swollen."

"Oh?" She raised her head and neck to try to see her leg herself, but Doctor Yu held her body down with one hand. "Don't move! Moving will damage your spine."

At that moment, Miss Zhu returned to the room and made a face at Doctor Yu. "How embarrassing!" She was so embarrassed that she almost cried. Fortunately, Doctor Yu turned and left, and Miss Zhu followed him out.

Moonlight shone through the glass window, casting itself on the bed and the floor, reflecting a dim brightness throughout the room.

"Ah! Isn't today the fifteenth of the tenth lunar month? Why hasn't my period come yet? Last time it came in late August, more than half a month late. Although it's been late before, it was at most ten or eight days. Maybe I have 'dry blood consumption.' Isn't Miss Zhou in room fifteen downstairs said to have 'dry blood consumption' too? She's been in the hospital for four months, and she's still not better. I heard this disease is lingering and difficult to cure. If I also have this disease, then that's terrible, and this back pain won't get better either! Ugh!" A wave of fear washed over her.

"Should I ask my mother when she comes? ...No, I can't let her know, because if she knows, she'll have even more reason to send me home. Once I go home, she definitely won't let me rest like this anymore, because she says the leg swelling is the result of lying down for too long. But the doctor says it's very dangerous if I don't rest for my 'spinal consumption.' Sigh, what should I do?" Fear, sorrow, and confusion all surrounded her heart.

"Should I ask the doctor if I really have 'dry blood consumption' these days?" But the feeling of shame immediately pushed aside fear, sorrow, confusion and other emotions and occupied her heart alone. The impression of Miss Zhu covering her nose and rushing away a month and a half ago broke through the suppression of her strong consciousness and re-emerged in her mind. She struggled to shake off the embarrassment of that unbearable impression. "What's the use of asking? They'll always say it's not true, just like the leg swelling."

She fell into the abyss of melancholy. She went from suspecting to believing that she had contracted 'dry blood consumption.'

### This Year's Weekday Calculation Method

— Peng Dou

Do you want to know what day of the week a certain date is in the twenty-fifth year? Here's a very accurate method for you.

Rule: Add one to January, add four to February, add four to March, add zero to April, add two to May, add five to June, add zero to July, add three to August, add six to September, add one to October, add four to November, and add six to December.

Formula: Add the date to the added number, divide by seven, and the remainder is the day of the week. If there is no remainder, it is Sunday.

For example: What day of the week is March 14th? What day of the week is August 25th?

Explanation: For March 14th, according to the formula, add 14 and 4, divide by 7, and the remainder is 4, which is Thursday.

For August 25th, according to the formula, add 25 and 3, divide by 7, and there is no remainder, so it is Sunday.

Essay

### "Unfilial" Sons

— Zi Fang

Because there is a saying in ancient books: 'Yao's son, Danzhu, refused,' therefore, later generations called people who are unmotivated and do not study well 'unfilial.' The meaning of these two words is unreasonable and illogical, and anyone with a little common sense will feel it. Think about it: If all sons who are bad are due to their unfilial fathers, then everyone who is a father in the world is undoubtedly Tang Yao. No wonder the Song Dynasty scholar Luo Zhongsu said: 'There are no bad parents in the world.' This sentence can be said to be a footnote to the two words 'unfilial.' If we must say that it is an unbreakable truth, then all sons who do not study well only need to marry and have children, and they will immediately become saints, which is 'as easy as turning one's hand,' why not do it?

However, in fact, there are many people with children around their knees who are also considered 'unfilial.' Then, does the son of this 'unfilial' son consider his father to be 'right'? For example, if someone is rebellious and disobedient to his father, then according to the iron rule that 'there are no bad parents in the world,' should that person's son consider his father's behavior of being rebellious to his grandfather to be correct, and even further imitate his father's 'excellent behavior'? If this is the case, then should that person say that his son is 'filial' and gladly endure his rebellious behavior?

### Family Talk

— Xing Ju compiled

Be careful not to deceive young children – *The Book of Rites*

In prosperous times, always think of times of decline; when entering the arena, always think of when you will leave. Wealthy families should keep these two sayings firmly in mind.

The appearance of a diligent and thrifty family: All utensils are neatly arranged. Precious things should be cherished, and even ordinary utensils should be neatly arranged and categorized, with everything in order. Even bamboo scraps and wood chips are useful. – Zeng Guofan

A family with a constant occupation will not starve even in famine. – Han Feizi

The legacy of a good family lies in preserving etiquette and law, not in not losing face –

Thrift to reduce desires can sustain life; thrift to do good can help others – Xu Shukai

Be careful of your words and deeds around your wives, children, and servants; examine your mind and body during your daily life – Lü Xinwu

The prosperity of a family is like the light of a lamp. A family does not prosper without accumulating virtue, and a lamp does not shine without adding oil. – Wu Cuisheng

Fathers and brothers cannot always be relied upon; people should value self-reliance – Huang Daozhou

Introduction to a Phthisis (Pulmonary Tuberculosis) Formula. In recent years, the use of oil-soaked ginkgo nuts to treat pulmonary tuberculosis has become popular in the north, and it is indeed effective. This formula is also known in the Suzhou-Hangzhou area, but it is kept secret and not widely publicized, so few people know about it. Recently, after successful experimentation, the method, efficacy, experimentation, and administration of oil-soaked ginkgo nuts have been printed for distribution. Inquiries can be made at Bao Shan Tang, No. 24, Lane 239, Fuxing Middle Road.
