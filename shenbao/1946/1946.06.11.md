### Marshall and Zhou Enlai's Secret Talk; Communist Troops' Attack Precludes Reconvening of Pre-Truce Group; Yan'an's New Demands Contain Three Points

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] Special Envoy Marshall received Zhou Enlai at his official residence on Ninghai Road at 10:00 AM this morning for a secret talk lasting two and a half hours. After Special Envoy Marshall learned of the new proposal from Yan'an brought by Zhou Enlai, he planned to visit Chairman Chiang this afternoon to convey the CCP's views. According to a certain authoritative source tonight, based on observations of the current situation, the basic attitudes expressed by the government and the CCP before the truce announcement were initially very far apart. It was only after Special Envoy Marshall's continuous mediation that a temporary 15-day truce agreement was reached, offering a glimmer of hope for peace. Unexpectedly, after the government's truce announcement was issued, the Communist troops inside and outside the passes relapsed into their old ways, launching planned offensives and attacking the National Army everywhere. Such deceptive behavior of clamoring for peace on one hand and engaging in fighting on the other hand, coming from the Communist troops, is not surprising. However, it has deepened the government's, the people's, and even allied friends' vigilance towards the CCP. It is faintly heard that, as a result of this morning's talks between Marshall and Zhou, although opinions were exchanged on the need to immediately hold the Military Three-Man Committee, given that the Communist troops in various places inside and outside the passes have not yet earnestly complied with the order to cease fire, the future of this meeting is also difficult to predict.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] It is rumored that the new proposal brought back by Zhou Enlai from Yan'an this time, although its content has not been publicly announced, has hinted at its main points to news reporters in some way. The general idea of what they plan to propose at the Military Three-Man Committee meeting is as follows: (1) Detailed methods for the truce will involve issues such as troop transportation, the takeover of Harbin, and the handling of democratic regimes. (2) Full restoration of transportation will involve issues such as how to dismantle blockhouses and remove blockade lines. (3) The military reorganization plan will discuss the implementation of attachments and dispatch of executive groups to various locations.

[United Press, Nanjing, 10th] Minister of Transportation Yu Da-wei visited Special Envoy Marshall's headquarters today to discuss the restoration of transportation. A headquarters spokesperson stated that since Zhou Enlai's return to Nanjing, Special Envoy Marshall has not yet scheduled another meeting with Chairman Chiang, and that what Zhou Enlai brought this time may be the CCP's "final price" for a permanent truce.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] Representatives of the Democratic League at the Political Consultative Conference, Luo Longji, Zhang Bojun, Huang Yanpei, and Shen Junru, took the train to Shanghai separately last night and this morning.

Also, Li, and Liu Dongyan, members of the Central Committee of the Youth Party, will go to Shanghai on the 11th. It is reported that the representatives of the Youth Party and the Democratic League plan to jointly issue their opinions on the current situation around the 15th.

### When Local Revenue and Expenditure Cannot be Balanced, Subsidies Will be Verified and Allocated by the Central Government; Opening of the Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure System Conference

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] The Conference on Revising the Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure System closed this afternoon. From the morning until the moment of closing, all participants debated the proposals with the utmost enthusiasm. The focus was on the "Ministry of Finance's Proposal to Adjust the Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure Budgets of Provinces (Cities) and Counties (Cities) for the Second Half of the 35th Year [of the Republic]". Among them, the proposal that the collection of local public grain should not exceed 30% of the tax quota was considered practically difficult. While taking into account the principle of considering the local people's capacity, it was decided to negotiate with the Ministry of Food and the Ministry of Finance to allocate subsidies for 30% of the collection. Various methods were also established for those whose revenue and expenditure could not be balanced in the second half of the 35th year: (1) In accordance with the provisions of the revised principles of the fiscal revenue and expenditure system, each province and city shall prepare a statement of revenue and expenditure balance and report it to the central government for verification and allocation of subsidies. (2) Expenditure on staff salaries should be planned under the revenue from the premium on the sale of goods in kind. (3) Remote provinces and areas that have not yet been restored, in addition to following the above two methods, should request the central government to specially subsidize and borrow the necessary business expenses, and should be handled on a case-by-case basis. It was not passed according to the review opinions.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The closing ceremony of the Conference on Implementing the Revised Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure System, convened by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Food, was held at 4:00 PM this afternoon. Yu Hongjun, Xu Kan, and more than 200 guests and members attended. Xu Kan presided over the meeting and delivered the opening speech, expressing gratitude to all members for the smooth progress of the meeting, and proposed opinions such as strictly prohibiting harassment, vigorously eliminating malpractices, and central and local cooperation. The ceremony concluded at 5:00 PM. Also, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM, general meetings were held, chaired by Yu Hongjun, and three suggestions from the first group on streamlining provincial and county institutions were passed. The meeting adjourned at 3:00 PM.

Chen Lifu's Alarming Speech

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] During the closing ceremony of the Finance and Food Conference, Chen Lifu, Minister of the Central Organization Department, delivered an alarming speech. It is said that this conference was a meeting dedicated to studying the fiscal revenue and expenditure system, but the results were not satisfactory. The internal cause was only a technical change, not a fundamental solution, and it was far from the goal of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. Moreover, our country is an agricultural country, but today's financial policy is not related to the 85% of farmers, placing the majority of the people on the brink of starvation. We should know that what China needs now is a thorough financial policy and active economic measures. If all policies and measures only benefit a few merchants, regardless of factory closures and rural bankruptcies, it would be inappropriate. Revolution lies in cultivating local autonomy, but at present, those at the bottom are all being grabbed to the top, resulting in a loss of both people and wealth, which is too far from the goal, thus forming an economy that abandons the fundamentals and pursues the superficial, and a political structure that is top-heavy, with many undesirable phenomena. After Chen's speech, the entire audience responded with enthusiastic applause.

### Central Memorial Week; Minister Yu Reports on Financial Measures

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The Central Memorial Week was held at 9:00 AM on the 10th. After Chairman Chiang led the ceremony, Minister Yu Hongjun reported on finance. Yu gave a brief explanation of the recent important financial measures: (1) the implementation of the national general budget for the 35th year, (2) stabilizing finance, and (3) enriching local finances. Yu also emphasized the need to reform the tax system, increase tax revenue, use gold and foreign exchange to stabilize the currency value, contract currency in circulation, and improve the banking system to promote production in order to alleviate the current financial difficulties. He concluded by saying that the most important issue in our country's finance at present is how to balance fiscal revenue and expenditure. He hoped that the CCP issue could be resolved soon, so that political stability and transportation could be restored, which would allow for the circulation of materials, stabilize prices, and gradually reduce the burden and suffering of the people.

### President Ju Arrives in Hankou; Stays for a Week Before Going to Chongqing

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 10th] President Ju arrived in Hankou at 1:00 PM on the 10th aboard the E Province Government's special ship, Jianjia, from his hometown of Guangji. After disembarking, he visited Cheng Qian, He Chengrong, and his old friend Xiong Shili. When reporters visited him at his residence and asked about his return to his hometown, he said: "The situation in the countryside is very peaceful, and the spring harvest is abundant. Although there are too many types of apportioned donations, the villagers are quite distressed. However, today, suffering can be openly stated, which, compared to the eight years of occupation, can be said to be suffering but not really suffering." When asked about the amnesty issue, he said: "This case has been shelved in the Legislative Yuan after it was proposed, and there is probably no concrete decision at present, which is regrettable." President Ju will attend a banquet held by all sectors of Wuhan tonight. He plans to stay in Hankou for a week and then take a boat to Chongqing to deploy the resumption of work of the Judicial Yuan before going to Nanjing. Rumors that he will return directly to Nanjing are inaccurate.

### National Government Commends Dai Li; Posthumously Awards the Rank of Lieutenant General

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The National Government issued an order on the 11th: "The late Director of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission, Dai Li, was loyal and pure in thought and courageous in action. He participated in the revolution at an early age and faced danger repeatedly. In the Northern Expedition, his strategic military achievements were great. During the War of Resistance against Japan, he was transferred to manage military intelligence, and he worked diligently and effectively, enabling him to anticipate the enemy's movements and overcome difficulties. He also concurrently handled the work of eliminating traitors, without rest. Unexpectedly, he died in a plane crash. Recalling his past achievements, we deeply mourn his death. The late Director Dai Li should be commended by a public order and posthumously awarded the rank of Lieutenant General. He should be given a public funeral in accordance with the example of those who died in battle as commander-in-chief of a group army, and the relevant department should provide preferential treatment for his pension.

### Hong Kong Government Protects Traitors; Guangzhou Newspaper Criticizes in Editorial

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 10th] The Hong Kong Overseas Chinese Daily continued to operate and attacked the Allies during the Japanese occupation. Recently, the Guangzhou Military Headquarters determined that the newspaper had assisted the enemy and, after investigation, confirmed that its President, Ling Weixiu, should be listed as a traitor. The Hong Kong National Daily specially published an editorial on the 7th denouncing Ling's crimes and urging all Hong Kong overseas Chinese to pay attention to Ling's actions and the transfer of the Overseas Chinese Daily's assets to prevent him from escaping justice and upholding the law. Unexpectedly, the Hong Kong government ordered the National Daily to cease publication for one month on the afternoon of the 8th. The Zhongshan Daily also ran an article titled "We Protest, We Accuse," arguing that this was an unfriendly action by the Hong Kong government. The editorial specifically pointed out, "The Hong Kong government has the obligation to arrest and extradite those who assisted the enemy. Not only has it not arrested Ling Weixiu, but it has also suppressed the newspaper that criticizes Ling Weixiu and represents the public opinion of the Chinese people. No matter what the actual intention of the Hong Kong government is, the Chinese people cannot but feel regret. This action by the Hong Kong government clearly has the suspicion of protecting Ling and speaking on his behalf. Therefore, we cannot but protest to the Hong Kong government and accuse the people of justice all over the world. At the same time, it also pointed out that the National Daily is sponsored by the Central Propaganda Department, which is well known to the Hong Kong government. Now the Hong Kong government has taken such a severe measure against the agency established by the Chinese government in Hong Kong, which is regrettable." The editorial concluded by saying that at present, many Chinese people, given the fact that the Hong Kong government does not act according to the wanted list of our government and automatically orders the Overseas Chinese Daily to cease publication immediately, doubt whether the Hong Kong authorities are really sincere in strictly implementing the cooperation measures that have been formulated. Furthermore, the press in this city is paying close attention to this incident and plans to take unified action to express a solemn protest.

### Jilin Provincial Capital to Be Established in Yongji; Northeast Headquarters Intensifies Repatriation of Japanese Prisoners; Zhang Daofan and Pan Gongbi Leave Shenyang for Changchun by Plane

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 10th] It is learned that: (1) The capital of Jilin Province will be permanently established in Yongji. The Northeast Headquarters has no intention of moving the Jilin provincial capital. The previous establishment of the Jilin provincial government in Changchun was temporary. After Liang Huasheng took over as acting chairman of Jilin, former chairman Zheng Daoru led a small number of staff from Shenyang to Beiping yesterday. Rumors here say that Zheng will replace Zhang Ting'e as mayor of Tianjin. (2) The Northeast Headquarters is currently repatriating Japanese prisoners at a rate of 6,000 people per day, returning to their country via Huludao. The area under the National Army's control is gradually expanding, and the task of repatriating Japanese prisoners is becoming increasingly heavy. Therefore, the Shenyang Japanese Overseas Chinese Management Committee has been placed under the jurisdiction of the Headquarters.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 10th] Central Committee members Zhang Daofan, Gu Zhengding, Gao Zongyu, together with special commissioner of the Central Propaganda Department Pan Gongbi, chairman of the Liaoning Provincial Party Department Xingzhou, chairman of the Jilin Provincial Party Department Li Xien, and others, left Shenyang for Changchun by plane on the 10th.

### Communist Troops Massing in Northeast; Fierce Fighting East of Yongji; Personnel Decisions Made for Changchun Executive Headquarters

[Our Peiping Dispatch, 10th] Official intelligence reports indicate that Communist troops are reinforcing the Northeast without slowing down despite the fifteen-day Northeast ceasefire agreement. Communist troop movements are still frequent on the Peiping-Suiyuan Railway line, with large numbers of Communist troops heading northeast via Peiping.

[Our Peiping Dispatch, 10th] Today marks the fourth day of the ceasefire. The sounds of war drums still resonate between the Yellow River and the Songhua River. Official sources report that the Communist forces are fiercely attacking Lafa, Wukeshu, Taolaizhao, and Hailar in the Northeast, as well as Dezhou, Yongnian, Gaomi, and Liaocheng in North China. Official analysis suggests that Communist leaders, anticipating the imminent ceasefire order, ordered the capture of the aforementioned locations as quickly as possible before the order was issued. However, due to the late arrival of the order, the Communist forces began their attacks after the ceasefire took effect.

[Our Peiping Dispatch, 10th] Military News: Around 10,000 troops from the Communist 2nd Brigade and 2nd Division launched a fierce encirclement and attack on our champion force thirty kilometers east of Yongji around 3 PM on the 7th. Fierce fighting continues as of the time of this telegram.

[Another Telegram] The Government's personnel selection for the Changchun Executive Headquarters of the Military Mediation Department has been decided: Major General Cai Zonglian will be the Chief of the Headquarters, with a Chief of Staff position under the Chief, to be filled by Major General Zhou Liwu, Deputy Director of the Government side of the Planning Department of the Military Mediation Department. The Headquarters will have an Adjustment Office and two intelligence sections and is scheduled to depart for Changchun from Peiping on the 12th.

[United Press Changchun Dispatch, 9th] For the first time in twenty-five years, the Communist army has suffered another defeat in "positional warfare." The first instance was the Jiangxi campaign from 1930 to 1935. This time, it occurred in the Northeast. The Communist forces, equipped with heavy weapons obtained from the Japanese Kwantung Army, waged a desperate thirty-two-day defense of Siping Street, reminiscent of the Battle of Stalingrad. Although the Communist forces sought to transform Siping Street into the so-called "Stalingrad of the Northeast," the National Army, with its superior quality, shattered their heroic dreams. The prolonged struggle in Siping Street considerably delayed the National Army's advance into the Northeast, but the crushing defeat at Siping Street severely damaged the Communist elite troops, forcing them to continue their retreat into forests and mountainous areas in other regions. Amidst the mountains of war spoils, the reporter witnessed the Japanese heavy weaponry used by the Communist forces, such as heavy machine guns, light machine guns, countless mortars, binoculars, automobiles, rifles, etc., along with a large quantity of Japanese pharmaceuticals. The National Army in the Northeast, due to its excellent training, experience, and equipment, displayed high morale in combat, knowing that they were reclaiming territory from the Russians.

### Executive Yuan Relief Administration Plans Four Major Projects: Improving Water and Land Transportation in Guangdong; Dredging the Pearl River and Completing the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway

[United Press Guangzhou Dispatch, 9th] The Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration’s (UNRRA) Eastern Branch has drafted four major plans to improve transportation and promote social welfare in Guangdong Province. The most important of these is to dredge the Pearl River to allow ships to navigate at any time, without having to wait for the tide. UNRRA has already allocated 4,500,000 yuan for surveying work. UNRRA engineering expert Feiler is currently in Shanghai, trying to obtain dredgers, pumps, and barges. The total budget is 81,657,160 yuan, with UNRRA covering 20 percent. The remaining funds will be jointly covered by the Guangdong Provincial Government, the Guangdong Customs, and the Pearl River Dredging Bureau. The Pearl River has become severely silted during the seven years of Japanese occupation. Even inland river steamers can only enter and exit during high tide, causing much inconvenience for passenger and freight transport. Before the war, ships could freely enter and exit, and ships with a displacement of 2,500 tons could directly reach the port of Guangzhou. The Pearl River is the main river of Guangzhou, and dredging is considered necessary by the shipping industry and other sectors. The second project is to complete the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway by the end of this month. This project is being undertaken by the Guangdong Provincial Government, with UNRRA providing flour for the workers’ meals. Before normal railway transportation is restored, the Guangzhou-Kowloon Highway will compensate for the shortfall. The third project is to repair thirty-six dikes in the Pearl River basin and build the Baobao Water Conservancy Project, 35 miles southwest of Guangzhou. UNRRA will provide flour for the workers' meals. These dikes protect 1,776,000 mu of farmland from flooding, safeguarding 2,782,000 residents in the area from threats. The total cost of labor and materials amounts to 2,875,310,000 yuan. UNRRA has allocated 1,946,000 pounds of flour as part of its donation. The final project is to develop the Leizhou Peninsula and Hainan Island, which are known for their natural resources and suitable environment. Up to 5,000 war refugees will have the opportunity to participate in resettlement and development on the Leizhou Peninsula. The first batch of 1,000 people will develop Hainan Island. This project will be implemented in cooperation with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) and with the approval of the UNRRA headquarters. Hainan Island produces hemp, ramie, tobacco, beaver pelts, and hogs, while Leizhou Peninsula mainly produces agricultural crops.

[Central News Agency Guangzhou Dispatch, 10th] The entire Guangzhou-Hong Kong Kowloon highway has been repaired and will be open to traffic in a few days. Once this road is completed, it will greatly contribute to the inland transport of supplies and import-export trade.

### Editorial: Encouraging the Youth Army's Demobilization and Return Home

The National Youth Army's term has expired in May, and all members will be transported back to their hometowns within this month. Those in the Southeast region, divided into the Marine General Team and the Yangtze River General Team, will be concentrated in Shanghai and Nanjing before being dismissed. The first group of over two thousand people arrived in Shanghai yesterday, and various circles in this city will hold a comfort meeting this morning.

Tracing back to the initiation of the Youth Army, it was during the spring and summer of the 33rd year of the Republic [1944]. At that time, the Japanese invaders launched the Xiang-Gui Campaign, Dushan fell, and Guiyang was in imminent danger. The situation in the War of Resistance was extremely tense. The Supreme Commander then issued the call "Ten Thousand Youths, Ten Thousand Soldiers," launching a movement for educated youths to join the army. Aspiring youths from all over the country arose in response, abandoning their pens for swords, and enlisting in the army in Chongqing, Qijiang, Luzhou, Wanxian, Guiyang, Xi'an, Kunming, Ganzhou, Yong'an, and other places, forming nine Youth Divisions. They were ordered to complete training in the shortest possible time, so that they could be sent to the front lines at any time to participate in the holy war for national liberation. By the early autumn of last year, the enemy surrendered, and the War of Resistance ended in victory. Although the young patriots did not have the opportunity to serve on the battlefield, the task they undertook can be said to have been completed. The military authorities then changed the battle-oriented education into preparatory officer education, scheduled to expire and demobilize in May of this year, so that these one hundred thousand youths could return to school if they desired to study, find employment if they desired to work, or continue to serve in the military if they desired to do so, each fulfilling their aspirations and finding their place. We express our utmost respect for the return of these one hundred thousand youths after their demobilization. Taking the opportunity of the arrival of the first batch of two thousand youths from the Southeast region Youth Army to Shanghai, we briefly write down our feelings to encourage the aspiring youths of our country.

First, you joined the ranks of the revolution in the autumn when the War of Resistance was at its most critical, becoming a strong force in the War of Resistance. Especially in the Southeast region, where most areas had fallen, the youths, unafraid of hardship, abandoned their pens for swords, which is truly commendable. Now, with the mission completed, you are demobilized and return to your respective positions. You should be able to maintain your original aspirations, saving the country and loving the people, and becoming cadres for national construction. You must know that the difficulties of national construction will be ten or a hundred times greater than those of the War of Resistance. Looking at the domestic phenomena in the ten months since victory, with all the disturbances and chaos, one can see that this statement is not false. We have not yet embarked on the right track of national construction. The reasons for this are undoubtedly numerous, but the most important thing is still the social disorder, the restlessness of people's hearts, and the even greater lack of discipline. In this chaotic, noisy, squalid, and superficial social environment, how can the revitalization and construction of the country even begin? Fortunately, you have all received rigorous military training and spent a year and a half in military life, having long cultivated excellent habits of valuing order, abiding by discipline, and being able to govern yourselves, act autonomously, be self-reliant, be strong, help each other, and cooperate. After returning to society, if you can still cherish these most precious habits, endure hardships and hard work, and set an example for the people, then the unhealthy atmosphere of today's society will surely be transformed by you, so that every person can be like you. The ancients said, "Scholars cannot but be broad-minded and resolute, for their burden is heavy and their road is long," which is almost exactly what applies to you. You are still young, with pure aspirations and strong spirits. In this prosperous and superficial metropolis, you should be especially vigilant, paying attention to the lurking traps at all times and in all places. A slight carelessness could lead to a misstep. Haven't you heard people say, "Society is a big melting pot"? You must be determined to be a piece of real gold that is not afraid of fire, and never be assimilated by the environment. Otherwise, if you drift with the tide, what can you say about transforming society? We wish you all the best, relying on the valuable training you have received, to practice what you preach, to fight against the environment, and to create a new world. This is what it means by "heroes create the times." Only in this way can you be regarded as cadres for national construction.

Second, everyone knows that it is not easy to start a business, especially the great cause of revitalizing and building the country. Our country has undergone eight years of arduous War of Resistance, suffering immense trauma and deep pain. Looking around the country, we see devastation everywhere. We all feel that the future of national construction has a heavy burden waiting for us to shoulder. Moreover, our material conditions are far inferior to others. Other countries have already reached the era of atomic energy research, while we are still lagging behind in the confines of industry. To speak of national construction, we must "catch up head-on." In the process of catching up head-on, we will encounter countless difficulties and obstacles, which require us to overcome them with perseverance and courage. Chairman Chiang, in his address to you on the 3rd of this month, also encouraged you to maintain the virtue of "hard work and endurance." The army serves on the battlefield, which is certainly "one drop of blood for every inch of land," but the same is true in the cause of national construction, truly "one share of spirit, one share of enterprise." We have seen the Soviet Union before the war, calling on the people to tighten their belts and build a socialist country, with the Five-Year Plan completed in three years. And now we see the post-war Soviet Union again, asking the people to tighten their belts and work hard on industrial recovery. We are a backward country, and we need to devote ourselves to the fullest extent. Fortunately, you have already trained your bodies to be like bronze muscles and iron bones. You are not afraid to carry any heavy burden, and you are prepared to endure any hardship. Some shortsighted people fantasize about living a comfortable and happy life after the war, but you, with your youthful aspirations, are determined not to indulge in self-deception. We also believe that you will not only not slacken in your work, but will also work even harder to complete your greater mission in the future.

The National Youth Army of one hundred thousand has begun to demobilize, and soon those who seek to study will study, and those who seek employment will be employed! In the past, you were a strong force in the War of Resistance; today, you are cadres for national construction. The burden is heavy and the road is long; may you all encourage each other!

### To Break the Stalemate in Policy Towards Germany, the U.S. Prepares to Send a Note to the Soviet Union: Germany Must Be Recognized as a Single Economic Unit; British and American Still Considering the German Federal Plan

[This Newspaper Dispatch] San Francisco, June 10 Broadcast: In order to break the stalemate in the major powers' policies towards Germany, the United States is preparing today to send a note to the Soviet representative stationed in Paris. If the Soviet side continues to refuse to recognize Germany as a single economic unit, then Germany will be divided into two, and the current one world will become two worlds. U.S. officials believe that in terms of policy toward Germany, the four powers have reached a crossroads. If Germany is not recognized as a single economic entity, then the clause on reparations in the Potsdam Agreement must be abolished, and the division of Germany into two must be implemented.

[This Newspaper Dispatch] London, June 10 Broadcast: Rumors that Britain and the United States have agreed to establish a German federal government are inaccurate. This matter is still under consideration, and Britain and the United States will not immediately submit it to the Council of Foreign Ministers. Detailed measures have not yet been formulated.

### British Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton Delivers a Speech: Calls for Understanding with the Soviet Union; Pravda Comments on Bevin's Speech: Says Britain is Prepared to Abandon the Principle of Mutual Cooperation

[Reuters, London, June 9] Tonight, before several British cabinet ministers delivered speeches to two protesting crowds at a Labour Party meeting, where they were drafting guidelines for the government's future domestic and foreign policies, Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton urged the elimination of misunderstandings and suspicions between British and Soviet relations. He stated: If the people of Britain and the Soviet Union can advance shoulder to shoulder in a strong alliance, then European peace can be guaranteed; otherwise, evil consequences will occur, and Germany will seize the opportunity to rise again, seeking its dream of controlling the world.

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, June 9] Today's Pravda editorial, recently broadcast by Moscow Radio, stated: Bevin's recent speech in the British House of Commons has psychologically constituted a real preparation, thereby completely abandoning the principle of mutual cooperation among nations. In practical terms, this speech attempts to take advantage of the failure of the Paris Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference to impose pressure and threats on the Soviet Union. We cannot remain indifferent even if we want to. Regarding the various issues discussed at the Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference, Foreign Secretary Bevin still insisted on the position adopted by the British representative at the meeting. It is reported that Soviet newspapers' comments on Bevin's speech are the first time.

### Disagreements Between the Three Powers Exist Everywhere, Not Excepting the Social and Economic Council

[United Press, New York, June 10] The United Nations Economic and Social Council has been in session for three weeks so far, and there are many differences of opinion on various important issues, but it is still hoped that this session will end on June 18. The United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union still have inconsistent opinions on major issues, and the Soviet Union's position is contrary to that of Britain and the United States, which is almost the same as the situation in the United Nations Security Council. There are now at least four committees working on redrafting the various proposals put forward by the temporary committee. The purpose of these proposals is to eliminate the different opinions expressed by the representatives during the ten lengthy meetings, which involve various economic and social issues, methods for resolving these issues, and which appropriate institutions should handle them. The Council hopes to pass various proposals at this meeting, create permanent committees on human rights, economic occupations, statistics, social issues, transportation and communications, and also approve proposals on refugees, assisting in the reconstruction of war zones, promoting freedom of reporting, and establishing the World Health Organization.

### Anglo-Egyptian Treaty Negotiations Stalled; British Chief of Staff Arrives in Egypt; Meeting Will Be Held to Review Future Defense Strategy Issues

[This Newspaper Dispatch] London, June 10 Broadcast: British Chief of the General Staff Montgomery arrived in Egypt today.

[Reuters, London, June 9] Field Marshal Montgomery left for Egypt this morning to hold an important meeting to discuss the defense strategy of the Middle East in order to adapt to the needs of the era of aviation and atomic bombs, and to plan a defense plan to protect imperial properties. The urgent issue in Egypt now is what Britain will do after the British army fulfills its promise to withdraw from Egypt.

Dispute Focus of Treaty Negotiations

According to reliable diplomatic sources, the difficulties in the current Anglo-Egyptian treaty negotiations are two: namely, (1) Britain agrees to withdraw its troops from Egypt, but requires retaining land and air force bases in the Suez Canal area to protect its vital imperial lifeline to India. (2) Britain requires adding a clause to the treaty allowing British troops the right to return to Egypt in emergencies. Egyptian people believe that with this provision, Britain can rebuild Egypt at any time under the pretext of this "emergency." It is now known that Britain's plan is to establish bases in Transjordan and possibly also establish bases in East Africa.

Various Speculations on the Purpose of the Visit to Egypt

[Reuters, Cairo, June 9] Experts here believe that the main purpose of Montgomery's visit to the Middle East is to study the military disputes after Britain decides to withdraw from Egypt. Some experts believe that in the event of a war directly affecting the Middle East, Britain will be prepared to abandon the value of the Suez Canal. The recent war has proven that the Mediterranean Sea is a captive sea, and in terms of new tactics, the Suez Canal is extremely vulnerable to being rendered unusable. Therefore, it is believed that Britain's new strategy in the future will focus on navigation around the Cape of Good Hope and the flight of aircraft across Africa. This tendency already existed during the Second World War. The English-language "Egyptian Gazette" reported that Montgomery's trip will definitely discuss new defense bases and defense plans for the Middle East, and a proposal to regard East Africa as a new British base to replace Egypt. It is reported that Montgomery will arrive in Cairo the day after tomorrow.

### Representatives of Seven Arab Nations Hold Meeting in Syria to Discuss Arab Unification Policy and Jointly Safeguard Legitimate Rights

[Reuters, Broumana, Syria, 9th] Representatives from seven nations—Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Transjordan—as well as Palestine, convened yesterday for a meeting of the Arab League Council, lasting three and a half hours, held in secrecy. It is anticipated that the meeting will result in the establishment of a unified Arab policy to support the Palestinian Arabs in resisting Jewish immigration and to support Egypt's national demands. The meeting's chairman, Transjordan's Foreign Minister Shuraiqi, stated before the start of the closed-door session that no power in the world could prevent the Palestinian Arabs from demanding their legitimate rights. Syrian Prime Minister Mibri Bay stated that the convening of this meeting serves to demonstrate to the world that the opinions of the Arabs cannot be ignored. Arab League Secretary-General Azzam stated that the withdrawal of foreign troops from Syrian territory was a result of the League's efforts, and therefore he expects that the Palestinian issue will also be resolved satisfactorily. After the meeting, the delegates split into two subcommittees and passed a resolution in support of the recommendation of the Arab Heads of State conference held two weeks ago, which was to block the implementation of the Anglo-American investigation proposal. The Palestinian representative attending the meeting was al-Husseini, Chairman of the Arab Higher Committee. Egypt was represented by Senate President Haikatar, former Prime Minister Nokrashi, former Finance Minister Ebert, and former Chief Justice Ramadan. All major Arab issues will be discussed during the meeting.

### Indian Congress Party Writes to Governor-General, Advocating No Party-Based Representation in Interim Government; Muslim League Expected to Occupy Five Seats

[United Press, New Delhi, 10th] Reliable sources stated today that once the final plan for Indian independence is finalized, Governor-General Wavell is prepared to grant the Muslim League five seats on the 12-member Executive Council of the interim government.

The Executive Committee is expected to pass a resolution today or tomorrow, expressing its position. Indian political figures here believe that the Muslim League's acceptance of the British Cabinet delegation's proposal is conditional upon the hope of obtaining equal representation with the Congress Party in the interim government. Congress Party President Azad stated that he has not yet agreed with the Governor-General on a date for a meeting. Muslim League President Jinnah has reported the details of his talks with the Governor-General to the League's Executive Committee.

The Council of Princes will meet in Bombay on Friday, and it is understood that the general sentiment among the representatives is to accept the British proposal.

### Southeastern New York to Build World's Largest Air Terminal, Covering an Area of 70,000 Miles

### U.S. Sailors Insist on Original Demands, Vowing to Strike Until Goals are Achieved, and Declaring Rejection of Government Arbitration

[Associated Press, Washington, 9th] The National Maritime Union announced today that unless sailors achieve their goal of reduced working hours, the union will strike on the 15th of this month. Oil tankers, riverboats, and even foreign ships arriving in the United States will join the strike. The current working hours are 56 hours per week. Government mediators advocate maintaining this level, but granting sailors one day of shore leave every 14 days with full pay. Shipowners claim that reducing time at sea would require onshore accommodation, inevitably increasing expenses and placing the U.S. shipping industry at a competitive disadvantage worldwide.

The union declared that any government action attempting to investigate, arbitrate, or discuss temporary agreements regarding the sailors' strike would be rejected. They stated that such plans do not consider the union's interests but merely delay matters in order to erode the workers' resolve. This declaration was unanimously passed by the National Committee of the Maritime Union. The forty members returned to their bases with strike plans and $1 million in funds. The declaration denied that the strike was motivated by any political reasons.

### Conditions on Sakhalin Island Under Soviet Occupation; Large-Scale Immigration of Russians; No Place for Japanese Residents

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 10th] Suzuki, secretary of the Sakhalin Island Farmers' Association, and twenty other Japanese refugees arrived in Wakkanai, Hokkaido, today after drifting for three days in the Soya Strait on a small sampan from Houghton Port. According to Suzuki, after the northern part of the island was ceded to the Soviet Union, the Soviet army generally treated the remaining Japanese residents mildly. Japanese workers operate the island's pulp mills under Soviet supervision, but Japanese shops have all been closed. Since February 5th of this year, all banks have been nationalized, and the Japanese yen has been uniformly converted to rubles. Rice production continues as usual. Most Russians have been relocated to Sakhalin Island, but most are single men. These people are purchasing houses, and the Japanese are being forced to move out. Rumor has it that Japanese residents will be repatriated to their home country in August or September. Among the senior Soviet officers, some are second-generation soldiers. There are also Japanese officers in the Soviet army who are of Soviet nationality.

### New Developments in Iran Negotiations; Azerbaijan Province Demands Cabinet Reshuffle

[Agence France-Presse, Tehran, 9th] According to reliable sources, negotiations between the Iranian central government and the autonomous government of Azerbaijan Province, which had originally seemed promising, are now facing new difficulties. After Prime Minister Sadana expressed his willingness to accept the province's various demands, the province's representatives made further demands, the most important of which was that the Sadana cabinet must be reshuffled before the agreement is officially established. The reason given was that as long as the opposing cabinet members remain in office, they will find ways to prevent the implementation of the agreement, and all issues cannot be resolved. However, in fact, a cabinet reshuffle will encounter major difficulties. According to Iranian traditional customs, the Prime Minister cannot demand the resignation of cabinet members; this is the prerogative of Parliament. According to those close to the cabinet, rumors that the negotiations have broken down are not true; correspondence between Tehran and Tabriz remains extremely frequent.

### The Foreign Ministers' Conference is of Great Importance; Bevin to Make "Last Effort"

[Associated Press, London, 9th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin is feeling very disappointed with the current world situation and will return to Paris again this week, reportedly to make "one last effort" to get the Soviet Union to cooperate for world peace. About thirty-six years ago, Bevin gave up his job as a coachman to organize the dockworkers' union, wanting to "do something" for the dockworkers. Now Bevin, who is nearly sixty-five years old and considered by some to be one of Britain's greatest Foreign Secretaries, is still in the same spirit, wanting to "do something," this time for the ordinary people suffering or often starving around the world.

Bevin is not optimistic about the upcoming Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference in Paris, but according to people close to Bevin, "the success or failure of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference is of such great importance that Bevin must make another effort." Although Bevin is very disappointed with the Soviet Union's rigid attitude, he is not surprised. He has only been Foreign Secretary for seven months, but he is not a novice in diplomacy. He served in Churchill's wartime cabinet for six years and participated in person whenever major British foreign policy decisions were made. According to people in the British Foreign Office, the then-British Foreign Secretary Eden and Bevin were often inseparable.

After the Labour Party cabinet was formed, it continued the previous British foreign policy. During the 1945 Labour Party election campaign, it enthusiastically declared that relations between Britain and the Soviet Union could be closer after the Labour Party came to power. However, the current situation is that Moscow's expression has not been friendly, and the so-called closer relationship with the Soviet Union is still a big question. However, Bevin may not think so, because if he thought that cooperation with the Soviet Union was impossible, he could have remained silent. Rumor has it that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov does not like Bevin, but he respects him.

Bevin is well aware of the difficulties of his work, but he does not show any sign of backing down. Last time he went to Paris, he said at a cabinet meeting before leaving: If peace is broken in any way, I will notify you.

Bevin likes to speak straightforwardly, and when he argues with the Soviet representatives, he is unwilling to show any weakness, but this has not diminished his patient and pleasant demeanor.

During the last Paris Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, he often sat stiffly in an easy chair, with no expression at all. He was willing to let U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes' opinion be completely consistent. According to his entourage, if there was any trickery at the meeting, he could immediately see what kind of meaning was contained behind the trickery.

Bevin has always been skeptical of the Communist Party, and this did not start today, but this attitude has not diminished his repeated negotiations with the Soviet Union. Bevin believes that using trickery will never be successful, and he does not care about personal grudges.

On February 1st, when he addressed the meeting of the Security Council of the United Nations in London, he said: The reason why the world is threatened is because Moscow is constantly using propaganda to attack Britain and using the Communist Parties of various countries as tools to attack the British people and the British government. The next day, the Daily Mail, run by the Conservative Party, published an editorial saying that Bevin's speech was a frank and challenging statement issued by the spokesperson of one strong country to another. But a short time after he spoke so solemnly and condemned communism, he and his fierce rival, Soviet representative Vyshinsky, "drank to the workers."

On May 27th, just after the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference adjourned, Bevin sent a telegram to Molotov, asking him to have "patience, tolerance, and understanding" when the Soviet Union was in contact with the Western powers. He returned to Paris with this hope.

Although some people disagree with Bevin's policies in the British Empire, the withdrawal of British troops stationed in India and Egypt, and the delegation of British-administered land to the United Nations, his firm stance on the Soviet Union has won the support of both the Conservative and Labour Parties.

A friend of Bevin said: "Bevin wants to restore Britain to 'greatness.' He believes that cooperation with the United Nations can achieve this goal."

### Truman Urges People to Defeat the Lurking Enemy: Internal Strife, Hardship, Famine, and All Disasters

[Agence France-Presse, Atlantic City, USA, 10th] President Truman gave a radio address last night, urging the American people to unite as they did during the war to end the suffering of millions of war-affected people. According to the President, it was easy to understand who the enemy was during the war, and all disputes were easy to overcome. But today, although the external threat has been avoided, justice and security do not automatically follow. For this reason, the American people must continue to fight against the lurking enemy. The enemy is internal strife, indifference, hardship, famine, and all disasters in the troubled world.

### Tibetan Scenery: Interview with Madame Kai at Jinshan Hotel; Sitting Cross-Legged in Bed, Reciting Sutras; Kai Moba Talks About Local Customs: Tibetan Men and Women Can Sing and Dance; National Assembly Delegation Leaves for Hangzhou This Morning

[Our Newspaper's Report] More than 40 Tibetan National Assembly representatives, who have come to Shanghai this time, have been widely welcomed by all sectors of society. Yesterday, our reporter made a special trip to the Jinshan Hotel to interview Zha Sa Kai Moba, director of the Bureau of Secular Affairs, the Tibetan representative, to talk about Tibetan scenery. At that time, Madame Kai was sitting cross-legged in bed, reciting sutras. Her scriptures were wrapped in a colorful satin scarf and placed in a yellow lacquered wooden box.

Kai told the reporter that the religious atmosphere in various parts of Tibet is extremely strong, which is completely different from places like Beijing and Shanghai. Dialects also differ from place to place. Lhasa is the political, economic, and cultural center of Tibet, producing the most wool. Among the residents from other provinces who are engaged in commerce, those from Beiping, Xikang, and Yunnan account for the majority. Most of the local residents are engaged in agriculture and nomadic life. Regarding education, Tibetan is the main language. Ordinary schooling, completing six years, is already considered higher education. The curriculum includes geography, history, mathematics, and other general courses. Most people can recite scriptures, so the general level of knowledge is considered average. However, not many people learn Chinese, and even fewer learn English.

### Women Are Not Skilled in Cooking

There are very few professional women in Tibet, and there are no women serving in government agencies. Most upper-class women are not skilled in cooking, and even if they know how, they never go to the kitchen themselves. The average age of marriage for men and women is 18 or 19. The common system is monogamy, but there are also polygamists.

For Tibetan entertainment, people usually gather to sing and dance, and there are dance performances. A grand gathering is held every month, and a large-scale gathering is held in July every year. Transportation in Tibet is quite inconvenient. To travel to and from the mainland, one can take the route through Qinghai and Xikang provinces, but it is most convenient to transfer through India.

### Representatives' Tour Program

The representatives will go to Hangzhou this morning to visit scenic spots and worship Buddha in famous temples. They will return to Shanghai on the afternoon of the 15th, and will be hosted by the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and other groups on the afternoon of the 16th.

They will return to Shanghai again on the afternoon of the 19th and plan to wait here for a shipment of luggage transported from India, and then go to Lushan and other places.

### The High Court Heard Many Traitor Cases Yesterday Morning and Afternoon; Zheng Liangbin, Former Supreme Advisor to the Puppet Propaganda Department, Vigorously Argued and Denied

[Our Newspaper's Report] Zheng Liangbin, the former supreme advisor to the puppet propaganda department, was interrogated for the first time at the special criminal court of the High Court in Tilanqiao yesterday morning. Zheng is from Ningbo, 45 years old, and has always worked in the shipping industry. In March 1933, he surrendered to the enemy and served as the executive director of the enemy-controlled China Shipping Company, and also concurrently served as the minister of the shipping department. Later, he also served as the director of the puppet construction department's Shanghai office, a special foreign affairs committee member of the puppet central political committee, the general manager of the puppet National News Agency, and the supreme advisor to the puppet propaganda department. However, Zheng still tried to argue and deny in court yesterday, claiming that he was forced to join the puppet regime and that the puppet positions were just nominal. After strict questioning in court, the court ordered a postponement for further questioning.

In addition, the court also heard the cases of (1) Lu Laiguang, from Nanhui, 39 years old, who served as the deputy director of the tax management section of the puppet Ministry of Finance's Salt Affairs Administration, relying on the power of the enemy's military police to specialize in buying houses and selling bricks, tiles, and wood; (2) Wang Luqing, the deputy manager of the puppet Fuxing Bank; (3) Wang Abing, an enemy secret agent.

The cases of Sun Fei and Lu Jinsheng, the secret agents of the puppet police bureau's political department, were also postponed for further questioning.

In addition, he will send a telegram to the land, sea, and air force authorities, requesting them to quickly designate a coordinating officer to discuss matters related to vacant housing. The meeting also resolved: (1) To complete the investigation of more than 8,000 houses inhabited by Japanese nationals within one month (including houses in Hongkou District, Tilanqiao District, Jiangze District, Yangshupu District, and outside the concentration areas); (2) To formulate a registration form for agencies applying for housing, to be submitted to the committee by the 20th of this month for review and allocation; (3) To punish owners who have driven away refugees and collected gold bars as rent.

After the meeting, in order to understand the actual situation, Secretary-General Dai Jimin, Deputy Secretary-General Chen Guanqiu, and group leaders Song Xunlun and Bi Gaokui went to Baodi in the Hongkou area to inspect the housing situation. They discovered that a small number of houses were originally empty when they were investigated, but were occupied in an instant. They immediately ordered the occupants to move out.

### Principal's Rape of Female Student Case Settled with a "Note"

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Jiangshu Middle and Primary School Principal Xiao Zhenpei, who was charged with raping female student Wang Qianying, was tried in the criminal court of the local court yesterday afternoon. The defendant was defended by lawyer Yu Congdao. Wang Qianying did not attend, but her mother, Wang Xiuying, appeared in court. Judge Xie asked, "Since you suffered so much, why did you withdraw the charges?" She replied, "The defendant's side repeatedly came to cry and beg to withdraw, so I filed a statement requesting it." He asked, "Have you already received 800,000 in compensation?" She replied, "Yes, but 300,000 was taken by the lawyer." At this point, the defendant's lawyer stood up and said that according to Article 217 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the charges can be withdrawn before the conclusion of the first-instance debate. Judge Xie then ruled in court: "This public prosecution is not accepted, and the defendant is released on bail." This sensational case of disrupting public morals was thus settled with a "note"!

[Our Newspaper's Report] According to news from the insurance industry in this city: In the past four months, cargo theft along the Huangpu River in this city has increased daily, with an average of 6% of cargo stolen from each cargo owner. A certain American insurance company has had to pay out between US$20,000 and US$30,000 per month in compensation for this in the past few months. If this theft situation does not improve, insurance companies will be forced to stop accepting cargo theft insurance. It is reported that most of the thieves are stevedores and idlers at various docks. It is hoped that the relevant authorities will pay attention to this.

### Cholera Spreads: Hope that Citizens Will Be Self-Aware; Authorities Must Not Neglect Improving Environmental Hygiene

The spread of cholera is currently threatening the lives of all Shanghai citizens. According to a report from the Health Bureau, as of the day before yesterday, 126 cases of the epidemic have been discovered in the city, with 13 deaths. This number may not seem alarming for a city of four million people. However, the key point is that it has only been a few days since the Dragon Boat Festival, and the weather has only started to get hot in the last three or four days. There is still a long period in the long summer. If the cholera spreads at this rate, it is truly chilling to think about. Seeing this year's situation, we cannot help but recall the great epidemic of 1932. According to the statistics in the book "Cholera" by Wu Yunde and others from the former Port Quarantine Station, a total of 100,666 cases of the epidemic were discovered throughout the country that year, with 31.8 deaths. The detailed numbers for Shanghai, Nanjing, and Beiping are as follows:

Location | Number of Patients | Number of Deaths | Mortality Rate
------- | -------- | -------- | --------
Shanghai | 4,260 | 317 | 7.4
Nanjing | 1,588 | 373 | 23.5
Beiping | 493 | 391 | 79.3

From the table above, we can draw two conclusions: First, in 1932, the number of cholera cases in Shanghai reached more than 4,000, and this newspaper has pointed out before that this year's objective environment, due to various factors such as population concentration, housing shortages, poverty, and ignorance after the war, cholera has a greater possibility of being rampant. There are now fewer than 1,000 epidemic beds in Shanghai, and if preventive measures are not taken to actively prevent and eliminate cholera bacteria, the future is truly unimaginable. Second, although there were so many cases of the epidemic in Shanghai in 1932, the number of deaths was relatively small. On average, only seven lives were lost for every 100 patients, which is much better than Nanjing's 23 deaths per 100 people and Beiping's 79 deaths per 100 people. What is the reason for this? It can be said that the main reason is that the number of people vaccinated against cholera in Shanghai is relatively large.

Vaccination can produce two significant effects: First, after vaccination, the chance of contracting the disease can be reduced to 10%. In other words, if you originally had a 100% chance of contracting cholera, after vaccination, there is only a 10% chance left. Secondly, if you unfortunately still contract the epidemic after vaccination, then your probability of death is still much lower than that of people who have not been vaccinated. It is estimated that the mortality rate of the latter is roughly 25 times higher. The effect of preventive vaccination can be seen from the statistics of Shanghai from 1928 to 1931:

Year | Number of Vaccinations | Number of Patients | Number of Deaths | Mortality Rate
------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------
1930 | 537,034 | 128 | 16 | 12.5
1931 | 761,279 | 482 | 57 | 11.8
1932 | 1,062,609 | 4,260 | 317 | 7.4
1933 | 940,600 | None | None | None

The number of patients in the above table has no comparative value due to other factors. It is worth noting that the mortality rate decreases every year with the increase in the number of vaccinations.

### Not Afraid to Repeat Old Sayings: Pay Attention to Daily Life

However, to be precise, vaccination cannot give you absolute protection. The most important thing is to have a strong body and pay attention to hygiene, so that cholera bacteria have no chance to take advantage of the weakness. The reporter is not afraid to repeat old sayings and here again puts forward a few points that should be paid attention to in daily life: (1) Drinking water must be boiled, and street cold drinks must not be eaten. (2) Flies should be killed as much as possible. The fundamental thing is to eliminate the environment in which they breed. Doors and windows should be fitted with screens, and at least food utensils should be covered with screens. (3) Vegetables should be washed clean and thoroughly cooked. Raw fruits should be peeled before eating. (4) Try to pay attention to personal hygiene, stay away from patients, and do not touch the bowls, spittoons, and clothes used by patients before they have been disinfected.

Finally, I want to shout loudly: The spread of cholera has reached a very serious juncture. Administrative and health authorities must take action quickly, reasonably solve the housing shortage, and thoroughly improve the sanitary environment, so that cholera bacteria have no place to grow. In this way, combined with widespread preventive vaccination and the self-awareness of all citizens, we can work together to eliminate this epidemic tiger that threatens the life of every individual at all times.

### Huang Fusen Scheduled for Sentencing: Witness Speaks Heartbreakingly, Trembling All Over

[Our Newspaper's Report] The case of Huang Fusen (former deputy inspector of the Central Police Station), the deputy inspector of the Special High Class and Criminal Section of the Second Section of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, was heard yesterday afternoon. Wang Ming, who had worked underground, testified in court. He said that when he was working in Shanghai, Huang, disguised as a beggar, arrested him, slapped him in the face, and said sternly, "You want to resist Japan in Chongqing? What are you resisting in Shanghai?" He also insulted the leader and confiscated six of his pistols and two hand grenades, and harmed his son, so he hated him to the core. While speaking, he trembled all over, his voice choked, and said with tears in his eyes, "I wish I could bite him three times!" But Huang absolutely denied his statement and hired a lawyer to defend him. The court ordered that sentencing be held on the afternoon of the 17th. Also, the case of French national Sari and Eminov destroying our underground radio station and using our radio materials to aid the enemy has also been concluded and is scheduled for sentencing on the same day.

### Xu Shaodi Returns to Hangzhou, Discusses Zhejiang Education, and Hints at Weariness

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch] Xu Shaodi, Director of the Zhejiang Education Department, returned to Hangzhou on the afternoon of the 7th after reporting his duties in Beijing last month. A reporter interviewed him, and he discussed the following points: (1) The plan to concentrate high school graduates for military training for one year before they can continue their education or find employment will be temporarily suspended this year due to insufficient preparation. (2) The budgeted number of publicly funded students, normal school students, and vocational school students in the province is more than two thousand less than the actual number. Minister of Education Zhu is very concerned about this and has promised to strongly advocate for additional funding from the Executive Yuan. (3) There may be changes to the methods of public funding and other benefits in the next semester, but the central government has not yet decided on the principles. (4) It will be difficult to restore the provincial-level people's education practice school, the Huazhong Agricultural School, the Hangzhou Senior Agricultural School, as well as the Girls' Middle School and Fisheries School for the time being. The previously planned establishment of a girls' normal school and a technical school is naturally out of the question. (5) The movement to respect teachers should be promoted. Those in charge of the recent movement in Shanghai and the enthusiastic people in society are all admirable. However, the principle that scholars should be poor and not take what is unrighteous seems different from raising donations to save Qing dynasty refugees. There must be some consideration for the propriety of respecting teachers by having their students beg from their neighbors to give to them. My narrow-minded view may be overly pedantic. (6) During the eight years of the War of Resistance, the educational institutions in this province suffered great losses and were severely weakened. Like a person after a serious illness, they must be properly cared for and nurtured. It will not be a matter of a day or two to restore their health. Recalling the past eight years of war, when schools traveled through rugged and desolate lands, or in and out of enemy-controlled areas, their ability to maintain education and barely survive depended entirely on the benevolence of the central government, the protection of the provincial government chairman and colleagues, and the arduous efforts and responsible dedication of colleagues in the provincial education community. As an official in charge of education, I have been constantly worried about making mistakes for the past eight years. Now that the responsibility of nation-building is even more arduous, I am aware of my lack of talent and feel overwhelmed by the task. I am determined to resign from the position of Director of the Education Department. (Skinny)

### Peking University Alumni Association to Commemorate Su Jiarong and Set Up Memorial Tablet to Commemorate Zhang Xinfu

[Our Report] The Shanghai Alumni Association of National Peking University has scheduled a meeting at 2:00 PM on the 16th of this month at the Xinzha Road Elementary School, at the intersection of Xinwen Road and Xiaoshadu Road in this city, to commemorate the late alumnus Su Jiarong. Su, courtesy name Yancun, was from Teng County, Guangxi Province. He graduated from the Department of Philosophy of the Faculty of Arts of National Peking University in 1920. He was very devoted to saving the country. While studying, he often wrote articles for various newspapers to discuss current affairs and awaken national consciousness. He was especially active in the May Fourth Movement. He was an expert in geography and first created the "Historical Evolution Map of Chinese Geography," covering the changes in territory and the rise and fall of national power from the time of Yu Gong to the Republic of China. He also created the "Sun Yat-sen Industrial Plan" based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's nation-building strategy, detailing plans such as port construction, river management, and road construction for the reference of the Chinese people. He also created the "Map of Transportation Aggression by Various Countries in China" to alert the Chinese people and encourage self-strengthening. After the January 28th Incident, he specialized in making various anti-Japanese maps, such as the "Map of Japanese Invasion of Northeast China," "The Province of Rehe and Northern Hebei Invaded by the Brutal Japanese," "Map of Japanese Invasion of Rehe," "Map of Japanese Invasion of Southern Jiangsu," "Map of Japanese Invasion of Shanghai," "Map of the Situation of China and Japan," "1/1,000,000 Map of the Three Eastern Provinces," etc., all of which shocked the Chinese people and aroused their shared hatred of the enemy. Later, when the government moved west, Su believed that he was engaged in cultural education and could not leave Shanghai for a while. After the fall of Shanghai, he remained in seclusion. Although he knew that he was under the enemy's tyrannical power, he still worked day and night to provide the Chinese people with unyielding maps of the Northeast, such as the "Complete Map of the Republic of China," "Far East Map," and "Pacific Map," often hinting at the enemy's movements to warn the Chinese people. As a result, he was resented by the enemy's military police department, who pointed out that the map did not include Manchuria, considering it a great act of rebellion. He was arrested on July 11, 1944, and all the maps he had made were taken away. He was detained for ten days and subjected to beatings and waterboarding. Su was physically weak and suffered internal injuries as a result. He sought treatment in every possible way, but to no avail. After the victory, he continued to write in order to make a living, but his illness worsened. He died on December 28, 1945, without any savings and in a desolate state. It was also learned that the school's alumnus Zhang Xinfu was killed during the takeover of the Northeast. A memorial tablet will be set up and a memorial service will be held on the day of the commemoration of Su to jointly commemorate the two loyal alumni.

### Respect Teachers Movement: Fundraising Results of Students in the City

City Schools Paid 20 Million, Private Schools 130 Million; More Than 30 Schools Have Not Paid Yet

[Our Report] The Student Fundraising Payment of the City's Respect Teachers Movement Committee has collected 20,831,200 yuan from city schools and 138,048,100 yuan from private schools. Except for the donations raised by university students, which are distributed to various universities separately and are currently being processed, more than 30 middle schools have not submitted their donations on time. According to general opinion, the donations from all the shops in the city are public funds from the citizens of the city. The formalities should be completed to maintain school discipline and show respect for education. It is reported that a small number of schools that have not paid have been inquiring with the committee because they did not understand the procedures, and are paying one after another. In addition to collecting the second tuition fee or raising funds on their own and the government subsidy of 20,000 yuan per person, the Respect Teachers Committee is currently planning to allocate 200 million yuan to private school teachers. City schools do not collect tuition fees, nor do they raise funds on their own. The Respect Teachers Committee only allocates 16 million yuan per person in succession. It seems that private schools are better than city schools. However, according to experts, the numbers are not much different (Ren)

Welcome Submissions: Primary School Curriculum Research Forum (2): Arithmetic Should Be Exempted for First Graders

Regarding the primary school curriculum, this can be considered an experimental report, and this can also be considered a temporary suggestion:

My third son, Lingling, is six years old this year. He entered the first grade of elementary school in February. He is a smart child. After studying for more than three months, he can speak Mandarin decently, and he can write small pencil letters as big as the squares on the exercise book, clearly. His grades are not bad, but his written arithmetic is relatively immature. One day a month ago, Lingling told me in frustration, "Today, the teacher said that I can't do arithmetic and scolded me." I asked him what arithmetic he was doing, and he wrote an equation with a pencil: 2 + ( ) = 5, saying, "The teacher asked me to write a number in this bracket, but I don't understand, and I can't write it, so the teacher scolded me." I usually don't criticize the teacher in front of the child, so I said to Lingling, "You can write a 3 in the bracket, and 2 plus 3 is 5." Lingling clapped his hands and said, "That's right, that's right!" A kind of innocent and completely unpretentious expression made me feel the cruelty of the educator. Why scold him and make him frustrated?

In the recent short month, Lingling has learned subtraction from addition. Three days ago, Lingling again complained to me in frustration, "Today, I couldn't do arithmetic, and the teacher scolded me for being stupid!" I asked Lingling what arithmetic he was doing. Lingling said, "The teacher said it was subtraction: My brother kicked 4 shuttlecocks, minus my brother kicked 2 shuttlecocks, how many more shuttlecocks did my brother kick? The teacher asked me, but I couldn't answer, so the teacher scolded me for being stupid." I comforted Lingling, "You are not really stupid, and you are not stupid. Subtraction that is so difficult, children as young as you, of course, can't do it." Lingling asked in surprise, "Then why did the teacher scold me for being stupid?" I replied, "Because Teacher Guang is smarter than you!" This answer is beyond the child's understanding. I was criticizing the teacher out of temporary anger. Young children are not omnipotent. Teachers should consider their intelligence and teach them well. They should not open their mouths to scold them for being bad and close their mouths to scold them for being stupid, so that their weak minds are constantly subjected to strikes that they should not be subjected to. To be honest, this is the teacher's fault, the teacher's stupidity.

Therefore, I thought that this is not only the teacher's fault and stupidity, but also the fault and stupidity of those who formulated the primary school curriculum standards. The teacher teaches addition and subtraction, all based on the nationally designated textbooks, and the nationally designated textbooks are compiled in accordance with the primary school curriculum standards. In the final analysis, it is the self-righteousness of those who formulated the primary school curriculum standards. I am not bragging, children like Lingling are really not considered stupid. He is not intelligent enough for arithmetic, and other less intelligent children should be even more frustrated. We educate to cultivate children's body and mind and spirit, and we must never make our children frustrated. I think: first graders, because their intelligence is not sufficient, may as well be exempted from arithmetic. In addition to teaching the ten numbers from 1 to 10 in combination with Mandarin to recognize them, there is no need to teach addition and subtraction at all. This is the standard curriculum that truly cultivates children's body, mind, and spirit. I don't know what the education experts think? Please advise. (Lou Shangwu, 1946.6.9)

### Hao Gengsheng Public Lecture: Review and Outlook on Chinese Sports; Shanghai as an Experimental Zone for Implementing Ideal Sports

Hao Gengsheng, a sports supervisor from the Ministry of Education and standing committee member of the National Physical Education Commission, recently came to Shanghai. Gu Yuxiu, Director of the Education Bureau, took the opportunity of Supervisor Hao's visit to Shanghai to invite him to give a public academic lecture yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM. Physical education teachers from various public and private schools in the city and staff from social education institutions attended the lecture with great enthusiasm. Director Gu of the Education Bureau and Director Shao Rugan of the Gymnasium accompanied him to the venue. Director Gu gave an introductory speech, and then Supervisor Hao began his lecture titled "Review and Outlook on Chinese Sports." The key points of the speech are excerpted below:

Hao stated directly that the original title of today's lecture was "Recollections of Chinese Sports During the War of Resistance and Today's Outlook." Due to time constraints, pre-war sports facilities were not included in the review. Today's lecture starts from 1938. In that year, the National Government moved its capital to Chongqing. The government's first serious concern was the inadequate physical fitness of conscripted soldiers. As a result, the examination standards had to be lowered from Grade A to Grade B, and even Grade C. On average, only 49 out of every 100 men passed. In other words, less than half of the men in the rear area who were serving in the military for national defense and resistance against the enemy were qualified. At that time, people in the sports community were alerted, especially those in charge of sports administration, who should quickly seek solutions for improvement. Therefore, in the spring of 1939, a sports plan was drafted, divided into three main parts: the first part was sports administration, including organization, laws, and funding; the second part was school sports, divided into implementation plans for physical education in colleges and universities, secondary schools, and primary schools (promulgated in 1940), as well as minimum standards for physical education facilities in schools at all levels; the third part focused on physical education teacher training, including ten points: increasing quantity, improving quality, hiring foreign professors, sending students abroad, registering physical education teachers, holding summer workshops, teacher training classes, military and police physical education training, normal school physical education training, and establishing a research center. Regarding the future outlook, there are also six points: (1) Implementation and development of the national physical education plan; (2) Review of the standards of next year's National Games and the World Games the following year to seek new performances; (3) Review of the effects of this war of resistance; (4) Necessity of adopting the principle of focusing on key areas; (5) Shanghai as an experimental zone for implementing ideal sports; (6) Aerial sports activities. The discussion was thorough and precise, and it was truly the most important and valuable conference on education at present. After the lecture, which lasted until after 6 PM, Director Shao delivered a thank-you speech, and the meeting adjourned.

### Black Market Retreats to Passive Position; US Dollar Rises Higher and Higher, Reaching a Maximum of 2650 Yuan

Yesterday, rumors spread in the black market that our country was researching a currency system reform, which stirred up some people. The market opened slightly higher, but the upward momentum was weak. After the opening, the price fell from around 1.88 million to the opening price. The Central Bank allocated 279 taels to the industry at a price of 1.865 million, at which point the market was still very stable. However, the US dollar was again stimulated by settlement demands and rumors, and the gold market was passively pulled up. Around noon, it rose to 1.9 million, then hovered around 1.89 million. In the afternoon, the demand for US dollars increased, and arbitrage buying surged, rising to 1.91 million before slightly stabilizing. After 2 PM, the pressure of next-day settlement increased, and the price fell slightly, fluctuating around 1.895 million. As a result, it was 50,000 higher than last Saturday. Ornament gold was 10,000 yuan higher, silver bullion was flat, and silver dollars rose slightly. Black market interest rates ranged from one dime to one and a half dimes.

Foreign currencies, especially the US dollar, saw a large settlement from the pharmaceutical industry, and the price rose higher and higher. There were rumors that the official exchange rate would be raised to 3,000 yuan, an old story repeated. From an initial 2510 yuan in the early morning, the price gradually rose to over 2600 yuan. Around noon, it was around 2590 yuan. In the afternoon, buying interest surged again, rising to over 2650 yuan before slightly falling back. As a result, it was 145 yuan higher than last Saturday. Gold hedging was squeezed to 725 yuan per ten taels. Hong Kong banknotes were lifted by the US dollar and Hong Kong telegram rates by 10 yuan. Indian exchange rate was 535 yuan, Hong Kong exchange rate was 442 yuan. A certain bank had a large cotton settlement, and the US dollar exchange rate was flat officially but sluggish unofficially.

### Cracking Down on Speculation and Eliminating Waste; Decision to Strictly Manage Foreign Exchange

Since the Central Bank implemented strict foreign exchange controls, the city's import and export associations believed that it hindered the development of their business and hoped to improve it. A reporter from the Joint Credit Bureau visited the person in charge of the Central Bank to understand the meaning of the management measures and whether there was any intention to change them. According to the official, the bank designated several banks to handle foreign exchange in order to develop international trade and support domestic industry and commerce. For more than a month, the situation has been good. However, after reviewing the reports of various designated banks, it was found that many applicants for foreign exchange were not merchants in the industry, and many only purchased fruits, cosmetics, and other items, hoping to profit from speculation. It was also found that some merchants purchased foreign rice, which could not arrive until the end of September, missing the timeliness of relieving the food shortage, and the foreign exchange they requested was often several million US dollars. Some trading companies only had a signboard and did not register with the government according to the law, but also applied to purchase foreign exchange. The bank was ordered to manage foreign exchange in order to support the development of industry and commerce, so that the materials for production and construction could be continuously imported. Unexpectedly, such a phenomenon occurred, which is truly regrettable. In order to avoid wasting foreign exchange, strict management must be implemented. All legitimate import and export merchants will be absolutely protected, and designated banks are advised to pay close attention. Except for import and export trading companies established before the war with more than three years of history, and those registered after the war, they are not allowed to apply to purchase foreign exchange. In short, the bank's measures are for the sake of the entire country and not for speculators. The established measures not only have no intention of changing for the time being but should be strengthened.

Furthermore, in order to avoid wasting foreign exchange, the Central Bank will conduct a thorough review of the foreign exchange applications of various merchants, examining whether the foreign exchange they requested was used to purchase goods as scheduled, and whether the purchased goods arrived as scheduled. If there are any cases of hedging or falsehood, severe penalties will be imposed. Moreover, the foreign exchange fund prepared by the bank is very sufficient. For legitimate merchants transporting materials related to the national economy and people's livelihood, the scale will be relaxed, and the supply will be provided as much as possible.

### Bulls Emerge; Government Bonds Decline

Yesterday, a certain bull faction collapsed, and government bonds fell slightly. The C bonds opened slightly lower at around 6,000 yuan. Some northern dealers emerged, and bull factions also sold off their holdings. After the opening, the price gradually fell to 5,600 yuan before slightly stabilizing. Around noon, it fluctuated around 5,850 yuan. As a result, it fell 300 yuan compared to last Saturday. A and B bonds fell 400 yuan, and D and E bonds fell 300 yuan each.

### Chinese Stocks Gradually Decline; Foreign Stocks Also Unable to Rally

The interest in Chinese stocks has waned again, and after the opening, the price gradually declined. At high prices, Yongsha was 5,920 yuan, Meiya was 4,420 yuan, Jingfu was 320 yuan, Xinguang was 308 yuan, and Qinxing was 240 yuan, all declining steadily. Before noon, Yongsha retreated to 5,600 yuan, Meiya to 4,150 yuan, Jingfu to 290 yuan, Dongxin to 215 yuan. The price rose slightly around noon. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Yongsha and Meiya suffered small setbacks, and Jingfu and the other three small stocks fell by half a percent. Cold stocks also fell by half a percent to one percent. Veteran stocks were also weak, and foreign stocks were still difficult to rally. There were too many chips, making it impossible to push up the price. Yisha opened slightly lower in the morning, fluctuated narrowly, and had little trading. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Gangye was flat, and the rest all fell.

### Yarn Market Trading Listless; Cotton Trading Still Good, Cotton Cloth Weak

The yarn market still showed no improvement yesterday. The price of 20-count large yarn was flat and sales were weak. Small and medium-sized factories intended to supply, but there were few buyers, causing the price to continue to fall by more than 10,000 yuan. 42-count double yarn and 32-count fine yarn were particularly sluggish, falling another 50,000 to 70,000 yuan. Weaving factories not only did not buy, but also sold off, resulting in no way out and making the price even more difficult to support. At noon, Fangjian opened yarn as usual, with prices of 20-count to 80-count yarn generally reduced by 40,000 to 100,000, but this still did not attract the intention of industry insiders to purchase in large quantities.

Yesterday, the New York American cotton telegraph continued to rise by 7 to 15 points. The prices were 28.75 for the near term, 29.25 for the long term, and 29.41 for the current spot price in Middleling. The local raw cotton trade was still good. Changzhou Dacheng and Anda factories both made purchases. In addition, flower trading was also lively, and market prices were higher than before.

The cotton cloth market's confidence softened. At the same time, the customer's intake was slightly sluggish, and grey cloth dyeing factories were also watching and waiting. Jin dealers still needed 12-pound colored ball fine cloth, but 1036 bleached cloth and White Cat patterned cloth were out of stock, supporting the price at 2,000 yuan. Other cloth grades saw mixed ups and downs.

### Market Arrivals and Sales Not Strong; Rice Prices Trending Steadily

Yesterday, the rice market was affected by rain and higher prices in the interior. Arrivals were not strong, and shop purchases were acceptable. The market was firm. Flour was firm, rising 100 to 200 yuan, bran was weak, falling 100 yuan, soybean cake was flat, and the price of oil was stable, with many arrivals from Qingdao and slightly fewer from Henan. The market was active but not strong. The price was stable. Yellow soybeans were scarce in both arrivals and sales. Broad beans were stable. Wheat rose by 1,000 yuan. Raw peanuts fell by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. According to information from the rice market, the total amount of rice arriving in the city yesterday was more than 4,000 shih, and the types and amounts were as follows: White glutinous rice 1,856 shih, Wuxi rice 455 shih, Bo Dao rice 1,418 shih, Bai Yuan rice 70 shih, Early rice 406 shih, Yin Yuan rice 90 shih, Yangxian rice 230 shih, Du Xian rice 95 shih.

### China Silk Company Establishes Factories to Produce Silk; Merchants Must Register to Sell

In addition to producing raw silk, the China Silk Company has recently promoted the improvement of dyeing and weaving of various silk fabrics. It is understood that in February of this year, the company took over two enemy and puppet silk factories in Shanghai and established the First and Second Experimental Silk Factories. The two factories produce more than 300 pieces per month. Since its establishment, it has produced more than 1,500 pieces, including eight types of silk, such as white spun silk, striped spun silk, black crepe de chine, and brocade. They are now officially allocated for sale. To avoid merchant manipulation, merchants are registered first, and the company gives the merchants the appropriate profits. Various procedures are established in accordance with the company's business regulations. There is no requirement for the capital of the merchants. After the registration is approved, various silk products will be supplied regularly. The company's main purpose is to urge privately-run silk factories not to stick to old methods. In addition to the silk factory in Shanghai, there is also a silk spinning factory in Jiaxing. At the same time, several enemy and puppet silk factories in Shanghai have been handed over to the China Silk Company by the government for reorganization and continued resumption of work.

In addition, the Yanping Road and Bailinan Road Silk Factories taken over by the company have been producing more than 300 pieces of various colored silk fabrics every month since they started operation. Currently, the company has more than 1,000 pieces in stock. It started registering silk merchants from both local and foreign areas yesterday to determine the actual sales volume of each silk merchant and allocate silk accordingly. According to Sun Bohe, director of the company's business department, the price of these silk fabrics will be cheaper than the general market price when they are allocated in the future. He is currently planning to start night shifts to increase the monthly output to 500 pieces.

### Chinese Engineering Students Doing Internships at British Factories

[Reuters, London, 10th] Sixty Chinese engineering students recently arrived in the UK for internships. The internship is planned by the British Industrial Association and the British government. They have been assigned to factories in various parts of the UK, such as London, Bristol, and Glasgow. Ninety students have already completed their training, and more than half of them have returned to China to work.

### Taiwan Tiles Arrive in Shanghai; Transportation Costs Are Lower

Recently, Taiwan shipping has transported large quantities of bananas and other fruits, as well as tiles. It is heard that the production cost and transportation cost of Fuliang tiles and porcelain are higher than those of Taiwan, and the transportation time is slower than that of Taiwan tiles. Therefore, part of the porcelain market will be occupied by Taiwan tiles.

### Overseas Chinese Loans; Totaling 50 Million US Dollars; Overseas Chinese Offer Two Opinions

The overseas Chinese leaders in Shanghai have offered their opinions on the government's overseas Chinese reconstruction loan program for the authorities to refer to. Combining the opinions of all parties, there are the following two points: (1) In the past, most of the loans were taken up by ordinary overseas Chinese who were not engaged in industry and commerce. Loyal and hardworking overseas Chinese have not benefited. It is deeply hoped that the loan-issuing banks will pay close attention to the review and enable loyal overseas Chinese who have been affected by the war to use the loan to rebuild their businesses and maintain their livelihoods. (2) Many overseas Chinese have now returned to their original places to prepare for rebuilding their old businesses. It is hoped that loans will be issued in a timely manner. Although the total amount of overseas Chinese loans is currently set at 50 million US dollars, the central authorities have indicated that they may increase it.

The China and Jiaotong Banks, which are in charge of the overseas Chinese loans, are actively preparing. Once the central authorities have negotiated the technical aspects of the loan measures, they will allocate the funds to the two banks and inform the overseas branches to start processing the loans.

### Silk Industry Thriving; Rayon Rises by 100,000

Yesterday, the silk market rose along with the rising gold price. The opening price of 120 Tiangiao rayon with light was 1.34 million yuan. It rose steadily, and the closing price was 1.37 million yuan. It was even better in the afternoon, with someone wanting to buy at 1.38 million yuan, and the selling price asked for 1.4 million yuan. Finally, it was called up to 1.42 million yuan, a huge increase of 100,000 yuan compared to last weekend. Various other miscellaneous goods also rose by 50,000 to 80,000 yuan. 75 Jinji semi-gloss was only 1.42 million yuan, 30,000 yuan higher than last Saturday. The same was true for factory silk, which also rose. 77-grade high-uniformity was priced at 2.275 million yuan. Dachang Foreign Company had four or five bales of transactions yesterday. The price of user silk in all grades rose by about 50,000 yuan. Actual sales were very rare. Intra-industry trading resulted in 40 to 50 dan of transactions yesterday. Silk goods were thriving, and there were many transactions. The forepart of Meiya was priced at 1.47 to 1.48 million yuan in the morning, 30,000 to 40,000 yuan higher than last weekend. Dacheng plaid was priced at 5,200 yuan, 100 yuan higher than last weekend.

### Tea Market Steady as Before

More than two months have passed since the new tea was launched on the market. According to news from the production areas, the harvests in various places are not as good as in the past, and the quality is also old and dry. Tea farmers are also affected by the huge amount of taxes and expenses, and costs are not low. On the sales side, exports are still stagnant. Only domestic shops and customers still have a way out. Because holders are reluctant to sell lightly, prices remain firm. In addition, old goods are mostly sold domestically, and the situation remains stable.

### Draw for Redemption of Four Types of Government Bonds Held at the Bankers Association Yesterday

Starting this month, the Ministry of Finance has resumed holding the government bond redemption lottery in Shanghai. The 21st redemption of the C type bonds of the 25th year Unified Government Bonds, the 8th redemption of the 27th year Relief Bonds, the 6th redemption of the 2nd issue bonds of the 30th year Construction Bonds, and the 3rd redemption of the 31st year Allied Victory Bonds were held at the Bankers Association on Hong Kong Road in the city at 9:00 AM yesterday. Eighteen bonds were drawn for the 25th year Unified Government Bonds, totaling 4.68 million yuan. Eight bonds were drawn for the 27th year Relief Bonds, totaling 240,000 yuan. Two bonds were drawn for the 2nd issue bonds of the 30th year Construction Bonds, totaling 800,000 yuan. Thirty bonds were drawn for the 31st year Allied Victory Bonds, totaling 30 million yuan. The winning numbers will be announced separately. All winning bonds and matured interest coupons, except for the 25th year Unified Government Bonds, will still be handled temporarily in accordance with the Customs Tariff Guarantee Debt Amortization Method, and the 27th year Relief Bonds will still be paid by the Chongqing Central Bank. All other bonds will be paid by the Central Bank and its authorized banks in various places on the original payment dates of each bond.

### Anthracite Trading Scarce

Due to the off-season, the market's intake is sluggish, and trading is extremely scarce. The price is hovering weakly. However, in terms of arrivals, in addition to those who have pre-booked vessel space, there are still sporadic arrivals. The excess of arrivals of anthracite and coke in Shanghai recently has not been promoted by actual sales. Supply exceeds demand in the market. Customers who transport coal to Shanghai are losing money and returning, so they have no intention of transporting it to Shanghai again for the time being.

### Sugar Prices Continue to Tighten

Yesterday, the sugar market continued to rise due to smooth sales. The association's price for spot white sugar was 73,000 to 73,500 yuan, up more than 1,000 yuan. The company's warehouse receipts were even tighter due to the convenience of delivery. The initial price was 72,000 yuan, gradually rising to 73,250 yuan, up more than 2,000 yuan from last Saturday. No. 1 goods opened at 61,000 to 60,000 yuan, with more than 700 bags traded. Xinghua Qing traded more than 80 bags at 71,000 yuan, and Diao Qing traded dozens of bags at 56,000 yuan, all up by thousands of yuan.

### Possible US Decontrol of Penicillin Allocation

[United Press, New York, 9th] The heads of major penicillin allocation companies in the United States all believe that the government's control over the distribution of penicillin in the country may be lifted on July 1. Representatives of the industry will hold a meeting with the government in Washington on June 15, when the issue of canceling control may be discussed due to the sufficient supply of penicillin.

[This Newspaper] The Fort Pascoe, managed by Jardine Matheson & Co., Ltd., arrived from the United States and Australia with 8,000 tons of wheat. The ship has arrived outside Wusong Port. Because there is no reliable port in the port, it is temporarily anchored outside the port. Also, the Green Pidgeon, which arrived from the United States with a large amount of gasoline, about 3,000 tons, entered the port yesterday morning and is moored at the Texaco Wharf. Unloading will begin today. Also, the Joplip of the American Steel Company entered the port yesterday evening, also loaded with more than 1,000 tons of gasoline.

### US Rayon Production Breaks All Previous Records

[Reuters, Washington, 10th] According to the Textile Economics Bureau, US rayon production broke all previous records in January-March of this year. Total rayon and hemp production reached 212,800,000 pounds, of which rayon accounted for 169,000,000 pounds and hemp accounted for 43,700,000 pounds. This figure is 10% higher than the same period last year and 4% higher than October-December last year. Domestic rayon consumption in January-March of this year reached 164,300,000 pounds, also exceeding previous records, 12% higher than the same period last year and 5% higher than October-December last year. Rayon exports in January-March of this year were 3,300,000 pounds, 27% higher than in October-December last year, but 42% lower than the wartime export rate in early 1945.

### US Invents Another Rubber Substitute

[Reuters, New York, 10th] The American Rubber Company has recently produced another new elastic material that can be used to replace rubber in the manufacture of belts, handbags, travel bags, etc. This substitute is available in various colors and can be engraved or painted, with a lustrous finish. Other advantages are that it is not easily stained and is not affected by alcohol, sweat, grease, mildew, and most acids.

### Government Bonds Redeemed!

— (Quiet)

After the victory, the government resumed holding the government bond redemption lottery in Shanghai. Yesterday was the first time. There were four types of government bonds drawn. Now, taking the Unified C bonds as an example, a total of 4.68 million yuan were redeemed. (Calculated at yesterday's black market price of 3,700 yuan, this would be 17,316 million yuan.) All kinds of rumors circulating in the Shanghai bond market have been dispelled. Although there may still be people who believe that the redemption of Unified C bonds should be handled in accordance with the Customs Tariff Guarantee Method, or still have considerable hope, the national treasury is a burden on the people. Whether the government is willing to enrich the private pockets of a few capitalists with the blood and sweat of the people is something that does not require wise men to know.

### Figures for U.S. Import Surplus: Import/Export Ratio of 7 to 1

[United Press New York Dispatch] The U.S. Department of Commerce announced that for January and February of this year, the value of goods imported by the U.S. from China was $8,360,000, while the value of goods shipped to China was $57,252,000.

According to customs statistics in our country, the value of American goods that have already arrived in Shanghai and been declared to customs exceeds 700 million US dollars. Other materials currently en route to China and those ordered from the US by various commercial firms in this city are not included in this figure. Calculated at the current exchange rate, this amounts to over 144 billion yuan in national currency.

### Priority Loading, 20% Discount: China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (招商局) Assists with Grain Transport, 2400 Tons of Sichuan Grain Headed East

In order to assist the municipal government in encouraging the purchase and transport of coarse grains, the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has responded to the municipal government, stating that it will prioritize the loading and transport of grain from production areas to Shanghai and offer a 20% discount on shipping fees. The company has already notified its branch offices in various locations to implement this policy.

The National Shipping Allocation Committee announced that from May 22nd to June 6th, ships dispatched by the committee to transport Sichuan grain to Shanghai or Hankou totaled approximately 2,498 tons. Previously, the committee's main transportation task was to rush the transport of Japanese prisoners of war. Now that all 340,000 Japanese prisoners have been transported, with only 1,500 medical technicians remaining, the prisoner transportation work has come to an end. Subsequently, efforts will be concentrated on transporting Sichuan grain eastward. It is reported that if there are no other obstacles, 10,000 tons of Sichuan grain can be transported each month.

### Summer Sales Campaign Launched: Buddha's Hand Slices Become Popular Again

Amidst the overall decline in prices of traditional Chinese medicine and Guangzhou goods, Buddha's hand slices have surprisingly become popular again. This is due to price increases in the production areas and the arrival of summer, which has spurred sales. Consequently, there is strong demand, with prices increasing by approximately 20%.

### U.S. Selling Old Ships: Age and Price of Vessels

[Hong Kong Dispatch] Several shipping companies here are engaged in ship sales and flag transfers (i.e., changing the nationality of ships). It is reported that the United States currently has many old ships for sale, with deadweights ranging from 1,200 to 5,600 tons and speeds of 9 to 10 nautical miles per hour. These ships were mostly built around 1916, with an average age of around 30 years. The price per ton is USD 35 to 46.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Timber: No significant changes, as incoming goods continue to arrive but actual sales are limited, remaining weak.

Seafood: New dried fungus sales are sluggish, experiencing a sharp decline. High prices and scarce sales for Hunan lotus seeds are further impacted by the influx of Raozhou lotus seeds, indicating a downward trend. Pickled mustard tubers are also weakening successively. Demand for agar-agar is exceeding supply, resulting in a decline.

Woolen Fabric: Price increases have reached their peak, and current demand has subsided. Lixing Palaces fell slightly by 500 yuan, and prices of other items remain flat.

Cotton Textiles: 6001, 8001 Double Monkey undershirts and 840, 640 Chrysanthemum undershirts are scarce on the market and are very popular. Zebra socks are selling well and rising slightly, and other products are stable.

Western Medicine: Saccharin is experiencing a sharp price increase due to large-scale purchases by merchants from Fujian Province. Due to the Health Bureau's ban sale message, Doulengle injection prices are decreasing due to public's fear, while prices of other items are mixed.

Leather: Merchants are actively purchasing textured leather, resulting in brisk sales and firm prices. Other products are unremarkable.

### Economic Briefs

Since the start of the silkworm cocoon market in Dongting Xishan, Suzhou, a total of over 390 loads of fresh cocoons have been collected. The purchase price is 104,550 yuan per market load.

The current yarn and cloth market in this city is not yet a legitimate organization. In order to develop yarn and cloth sales, preparations are underway to request the government to reinstate the yarn and cloth trading market.

The China National Industries Association earnestly requests the authorities to change the principles for handling enemy and puppet property, returning private factories that were seized by the enemy and puppets during the occupation. All raw materials, finished products, and additions or alterations made to the factories should also be handed over to the original owners to compensate for their losses. The disposal bureau is currently carefully considering this proposal.

According to statistics from the banking industry, recent inland remittances from Xuzhou and Tianjin to Shanghai have been significant. Recently, large quantities of silk fabrics and paper from Shanghai and cotton yarn from Tianjin have been transported to Xuzhou and Tianjin, respectively. These two places are known for exporting large quantities of furs, but the season is still early, and prices are similar to those in Shanghai. Merchants see no profit in purchasing, so most transactions involve remittances in cash to Shanghai.

### A Group Portrait of Fourteen Traitorous Giants Escorted from Beiping to Nanjing

— Special Correspondent Zhang Jianmei

Report from our newspaper's Beiping office, dated the 25th

Wang Yintai: Wang Yintai is the leader of the fourteen major traitors from North China being escorted to Nanjing. On the eve of the Japanese surrender, he was still the chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission. He is 58 years old, from Shanxi Province. He studied in Germany in his early years and has a German wife. He worked as a lawyer and a judge, speaks fluent Mandarin, and has a silver tongue. He is a high-profile individual. After the July 7th Incident, he served as a puppet official for eight years, holding positions such as Minister of Industry in the puppet Provisional Government, Standing Committee Member of the North China Political Affairs Commission, Superintendent of the puppet General Bureau of Industry, Chairman of the puppet North China Cooperative Enterprise Federation, Superintendent of the puppet General Bureau of Agriculture, Director of the puppet General Affairs Department, Member of the puppet National Economic Commission, and Chairman of the puppet North China Food Commune. Later, his treacherous career flourished, and he became the Chairman of the puppet North China Political Affairs Commission and concurrently the President of the puppet Xinmin Association. He recruited laborers for the enemy, provided intelligence to the enemy, called on the people to donate copper and iron, and supplied the enemy with large amounts of coal, willingly serving as the enemy's hunting dog in ruling China.

When he was escorted from the Army Prison in Paoyuju Hutong, Beiping, he was wearing a rather smart tea-brown Western-style suit, a white shirt, a bronze-colored tie, and a pair of leather loafers made from leather shoes. When his clothes were inspected before boarding the plane, it was discovered that his belt was a white gauze bandage. He was somewhat embarrassed.

When a reporter asked him what his thoughts were, he initially refused to answer. Later, he cunningly said, "I have nothing to say. The people of North China will know everything about me, and I believe that the government's judgment will be fair."

At the gate of the Army Prison, just before the car was about to leave, he smiled bitterly at the reporter and said, "Farewell, Beiping. I'm afraid I won't be able to return." As the truck passed Dengshikou, his German wife and three daughters were watching him and weeping in the crowd of people pointing and cursing the traitors.

Qi Xieyuan: Qi Xieyuan can be considered the most senior warlord among this group of major traitors. Before the July 7th Incident, this general, who had "retired in Tianjin," was already flirting with the Japanese intelligence agencies. After the July 7th Incident, he organized the puppet Provisional Government with Wang Kemin and others, serving as a standing committee member and the Director-General of the Security Department. Subsequently, he served as the president of the puppet military academy, the superintendent of the puppet General Security Department, the commander-in-chief of the puppet Security Army, and a standing committee member of the puppet Military Commission. During his tenure as a puppet official, he repeatedly recruited puppet Security Army soldiers, forming eleven group armies stationed throughout North China, disrupting the War of Resistance and arresting and killing many underground workers of the Central Government.

He is 62 years old this year and is the tallest among these traitors. He is bald, wearing a black satin hat, a black mandarin jacket, a light gray lined robe, and satin shoes. This old fellow's face is red, and a smile constantly floats on his thick skin. However, when someone asked him about his feelings about the escort, he became agitated and patted his chest, saying, "I have not wronged the common people. This time, I will definitely listen to the sanctions of the national law!" Then, as if comforting and self-deprecating, he said to Liu Yushu, the puppet mayor of Beijing, who was handcuffed to him, "Mayor, you have not wronged the people either." A set of self-deceiving nonsense.

Yin Rugeng: Yin Rugeng is an "advanced" traitor. Eleven years ago, in November of the 24th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1935], he took advantage of Japan's attempt to invade North China and openly seized 22 counties in eastern Hebei, establishing the so-called "East Hebei Anti-Communist Autonomous Government." He accepted Japanese command, forcing people to sell the Liujiang Coal Mine, establishing the East Hebei Bank, and protecting Japanese and Korean ruffians who smuggled silver exports. After the Tongzhou Incident, he secretly signed three major conditions with Japan: (1) Do not announce the truth about the Tongzhou Incident, (2) Do not engage in political activities, and (3) Report all activities to the Japanese military police at any time. After the "East Hebei Government" collapsed, in the 32nd year [of the Republic, i.e. 1943], he responded to Wang Jingwei's invitation and served as a special commissioner of the National Economic Commission. He is an old-brand traitor.

He is 57 years old this year and looks old, completely different from how he looked in the East Hebei era. He is wearing a large blue cloth coat and a black satin vest. When a reporter asked him what his thoughts were, he just smiled and said, "Nothing to say, nothing to say." He pretended to be calm but constantly took off his hat and wiped his sweat with a handkerchief. He carried Lao Tzu and Zhuang Tzu's books and the "Book of Great Exaltation."

Wang Shijing: Wang Shijing was the superintendent of the Finance Department of the puppet North China Political Affairs Commission. He is the most handsome and extravagant figure in this group. He wears a light-colored woolen lined robe, floral striped woolen dress pants, yellow thin-soled leather shoes, a taupe-colored top hat, and carries a small leather bag. He wears white rings on both hands. During the inspection at the airport, it was discovered that his handbag contained the most complete items: various tonics, powder, soap, a fan, and a small, tightly wrapped package. When opened, it was a roll of confessions, and a large, meticulously mounted hardcover xuan paper notebook, probably for writing confessions.

His identity is difficult to understand. According to those in charge, he was indeed involved in "underground work." His family had a radio station for contacting the Central Government, so the authorities were relatively polite to him. For the past six months, he and Yu Jinhe had been under house arrest and did not enter the Army Prison until 25 minutes before the escort, when they were taken to the Army Prison in a small car. However, he is not without sin, such as issuing counterfeit currency and disrupting the financial system.

When the reporter asked him questions, he feigned deafness and dumbness, with Yu Jinhe serving as his translator. Yu Jinhe put his hand to his mouth in a trumpet shape and aimed at Wang's ear, "This gentleman is asking you if you have anything else to say?" He smiled shamefully, "Nothing, nothing, thank you, I am just ashamed, I should be, I should be."

Yu Jinhe: Yu Jinhe served as the mayor of Beijing, a member of the puppet North China Political Affairs Commission, and the chairman of the puppet Cooperative Enterprise Federation. During his five years in puppet positions, he emphasized frugality and increased production, obeyed the enemy's orders, strengthened enslavement education, issued residence permits, and captured and killed anti-Japanese personnel.

He is 58 years old this year, wearing a felt hat, a gray silk robe, and coarse cloth shoes. He speaks very elegantly, "In Beiping, I have not wronged the people." "It is right for the state to punish traitors and rectify discipline, but it seems that we should also consider our circumstances." He also said, "This time I was not clear-headed, I will die without regret." On the prison truck, he looked around. He saw many of his former subordinates before the incident (he was the police chief of Peiping before the incident) who had participated in the War of Resistance and returned to Beiping, some even serving as escorts. He talked to an old acquaintance, and his eyes were already moist.

Jiang Kanghu: Jiang Kanghu, who opposed vernacular Chinese in his early years, returned from the United States in the 28th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1939] and lived in Hong Kong. Soon after, he heeded Wang Jingwei's encouragement and participated in the "Peaceful National Construction Movement." He subsequently served as the vice president and president of the puppet Examination Yuan, and a member of the puppet National Government. After the victory of the War of Resistance, he was arrested in Beiping on December 5th of last year. In prison, he showed off a bit, saying that when the Japanese strictly controlled food, he had advocated protesting in the puppet National Government. He had also requested serious consideration when declaring war on Britain and the United States, but unfortunately, none of these had any effect.

This 64-year-old fellow looked old and frail when leaving the Army Prison, his face pale, as if he were very frightened. He wore black-rimmed glasses, a black felt top hat, and a gray cloth lined robe. He didn't look like a student who had stayed in the United States at all. He did not answer the reporter's questions, but in his heart, he seemed to be trying to suppress his uneasy emotions.

Zhou Zuoren: After the fall of Beiping, the old scholar suddenly grew impatient with the loneliness of Kuyuzhai and enthusiastically became a puppet official. He served as the president of the puppet Peking University and a standing committee member and superintendent of the Education Department of the puppet North China Political Affairs Commission. After the victory, national law brought him from Kuyuzhai to "Bitter Prison Studio," to taste the flavor of iron bars.

The old scholar Zhou is as thin as a monkey, bald, wearing yellow-rimmed glasses, and wearing a gray-yellow lined robe, with a desolate look. He said, "After the victory, I sat at home waiting for the sanctions of the state. I have no feelings now." His voice was very low, with a bitter smile. Before being arrested, he argued to reporters in Kuyuzhai that his reason for becoming an official and president was to educate young people in the occupied areas for the country and to preserve the country's vitality. He had negotiated with the Japanese several times, telling them not to force students to participate in rallies all day long, so as not to waste their studies.

Among this group of major traitors from North China being escorted to Nanjing, he is the lightest in weight, only 52 kilograms. Compared to Tang Yangdu, the puppet governor of Shandong Province, who weighs 90 kilograms, he is almost half the weight. Although he served as a puppet official for several years, he is the poorest compared to other traitors. It is said that his family members visit him in prison every month, bringing him only a little more than ten thousand yuan for spending money. Compared to Zou Quansun, whose family sends one or two hundred thousand yuan at a time, he is far behind. His luggage for this escort to Nanjing is also the simplest, a small bundle weighing less than ten pounds, containing two books: one is his own "Collected Essays on Dragons," and the other is "Zhu Xi's Family Instructions."

Pan Yugui: Pan Yugui is the criminal who colluded with the "Tiger of Malaya" - Yamashita Tomoyuki to station troops in Beiping after the July 7th Incident. At that time, he was responsible for hosting the Maintenance Committee, using the excuse of maintaining public order to intimidate the National Army and party and government personnel, setting a deadline for them to leave Beiping, and leading enemy troops to station in the city. He also burned the Premier's legacy and various books related to party ideology in private collections. Later, as the mayor of Tianjin, he completely obeyed the enemy's commands.

In the Army Prison, he once argued that when he was the police chief of Beijing, he had used his body to block the cannon muzzle when the enemy was bombarding the city, preventing the bombardment and protecting the lives and property of the Central Party, government, and military personnel and citizens. During his tenure as the puppet mayor of Tianjin, he never set up a "Higher Special Agent Section" to avoid harming the citizens. As the chairman of the North China Reclamation Company, he had negotiated with the Japanese and obtained 2,000 bags of food, none of which were acts of benefiting the enemy and betraying the country.

This traitor, nicknamed "Traitor Cao Cao," is 64 years old this year, with a white beard and a green complexion. In his suitcase, in addition to pastries, there are all tonics. It is said that his heart disease is quite severe. He did not respond to the reporter's questions.

Zou Quansun: Zou Quansun was the president of the Beiping Chamber of Commerce during the occupation, manipulating finance, manipulating prices, and committing all kinds of evil. After the victory, he was one of the most active traitors, using the ill-gotten wealth he had plundered from the people over the years to bribe officials and seek leniency everywhere. Unfortunately, his crimes were too great to be covered up by money.

He is 44 years old this year, from Fushan, Shandong Province, wearing a gray cloth long gown, obviously trying to appear poor. He said to the reporter, "I think I will be very natural, because..." He laughed loudly, his mouth full of gold teeth, wide open.

Now let me write down his important resume: Chairman of the puppet North China Chamber of Commerce Federation and the Beijing Chamber of Commerce, Director of the North China Headquarters of the East Asia Economic Roundtable, Member of the North China Political Affairs Commission.

Liu Yushu: Liu Yushu served as the puppet mayor of Beijing and a member of the North China Political Affairs Commission. He is from Suining, Sichuan Province.

A small old man of 63 years old, but looks only like he is in his forties, wearing a light blue thin cotton robe. On the way from the Army Prison to Nanyuan Airport, he made a lot of noise on the large truck where fourteen people were sitting together, something he was not used to. He replied to the reporter's inquiry, "I have nothing to say. The crimes I have committed are not open to appeal, and my life will be judged by the people of Beijing." Another reporter, also from Beijing, then asked him, "Do you remember feeding the people of Beijing mixed flour?" He blushed and said nothing.

Tang Yangdu: Tang Yangdu served as the puppet governor of Shandong Province, as well as a standing committee member of the North China Political Affairs Commission and the Superintendent of the Public Works Department. He is from Zou County, Shandong Province, 57 years old this year, and tall. He can be described as the "donkey in the sheep herd" among the traitors. He wears a long robe and mandarin jacket, and the beard hanging down his chest is completely white. Some people say that he has the air of a Greek scholar, but he is a thorough old traitor.

He still wants to live, shamelessly using his children as a shield: "My elder brother is also resisting the war in the mainland, and my eldest son died for the resistance in Kunming, and my second son died for the resistance in Chongqing. As for myself, I am old and decrepit and will die. It doesn't matter, I have been preparing for it for a long time. Before you started arresting us, I voluntarily surrendered to the headquarters. Please give me a fair trial."

Chen Zengi: Chen Zengi served as the governor of Hebei Province, as well as a standing committee member of the North China Political Affairs Commission and the Superintendent of the Agricultural Affairs Department. He is 63 years old this year, from Qingxian, Hebei Province. He wears a light blue sherwani coat and satin shoes. He is plump all over. After arriving at the airport, he said, "It's almost over. I'm going to take another flight." Wang Shijing glared at him, as if saying, "You're so insensitive!"

Wen Yuanmo and Wang Mo

Among this group of major traitors from North China being escorted to Nanjing, there are three cultural traitors. In addition to Zhou Zuoren, there are also two devils—Wen Yuanmo and Wang Mo. They both served as standing committee members and superintendents of the Education Department of the puppet North China Political Affairs Commission.

Wen Yuanmo is a well-known physics professor. He unfortunately lost his integrity when he took office as the superintendent of the puppet Education Department in April of last year. He said that he was a poor teacher and that the money he was taking to Nanjing was also very meager.

Wang Mo studies geology. The World Geography published by the World Book Company, which is quite famous, was written by him. He served as a puppet superintendent during the occupation. That day, he was wearing a gray cloth shirt and looked extremely embarrassed.

The Expressions of the Major Traitors in Beiping When Answering Questions from Our Newspaper's Reporter

### Visiting the World's Smallest Republic: San Marino

By Xue Tong, from Rome, May

Although Italy is a boot-shaped peninsula in the Mediterranean Sea, it encompasses two independent nations within its small territory: the Vatican Papal State in Rome and the world's smallest republic, San Marino, located approximately 400 kilometers north of Rome. The former is more widely known, while the latter receives less attention due to its remote location. Taking advantage of the Spring Festival holiday, I drove north from Rome for a day trip and now record my experiences.

(1) Sightseeing Along the Way

The Italian region that suffered the most war damage was Rimini, located in central Italy along the Adriatic coast. Rimini marked the end of the German Gothic Line, the other end being Florence. British and German forces fought fiercely here, advancing and retreating repeatedly for 25 days. Consequently, nine out of ten houses in Rimini were destroyed. The Republic of San Marino is located 23 kilometers northwest of the much-feared Rimini. To its north was the German defense line, and to its south the British positions, truly in the midst of crossfire—one can imagine the constant fright they endured. I first paid my respects to Rimini, where the ruins and debris reflected in the clear, beautiful blue sea resembled a dead city, filling my heart with sorrow. Then, I drove towards San Marino. Two rows of peach and bamboo trees lined the road, their vibrant colors intense and radiant, exceptionally fresh and beautiful. As the car approached the villages, a fresh breeze greeted us, filling us with a sense of longing. The terrain became increasingly elevated, and the capital of San Marino was located on Mount Titano, a majestic and towering peak. The sound of the car startled the village girls working in the fields, who, draped in light veils, leaned against their huts and smiled, signaling their welcome. Apparently, few tourists had visited since the war, and I was likely the first Chinese national to visit this country after the war. Upon reaching the border, there was a small bridge about two zhang (approximately 6.6 meters) long. Beside the bridge stood a horizontal plaque with the inscription "Republic of San Marino." The bridge had just been repaired. Upon inquiry, I was told that San Marino had maintained neutrality throughout the war, but the bridge was the only international transportation route, so it had to be destroyed to ensure national defense. Having booked a hotel by phone the day before, I was greeted outside the city by a hotel attendant who guided me to the capital. The hotel was named "Titano," after the mountain. It was clean and well-arranged, and the prices were reasonable, aimed at attracting tourists.

(2) A Brief History of the Founding of the Nation

After a brief rest, I visited the government. Due to the Spring Festival holiday, I was unable to meet with the main administrative officials. I only met with the Secretary of the Interior Ministry, who kindly received me and accompanied me on a tour of the entire country. According to him, the entire national territory is 61 kilometers long, with a population of 16,000, including one capital city (population 2,000) and eight rural towns. The country's founding dates back to 301 AD, by an Arab priest named Saint Marinus. It initially began as a religious collective, and in 542 AD, it formed into an independent state. In 1600 AD, the constitution was formally promulgated, establishing a republican system of government. I asked how such a small place had been able to survive to this day, unaffected by global changes. He replied that in the Middle Ages, when military equipment was not sophisticated, San Marino was located on Mount Titano, commanding a high vantage point and having a strategic location. In addition, the people were martial and skilled in battle, so it was repeatedly invaded but never conquered. In 1807, Napoleon I occupied Italy and wanted to gift the nearby cities of Rimini and Cesena to San Marino, but the San Marino authorities refused, for which the Italians are still grateful to this day. In 1849, during the Italian unification movement, General Garibaldi sought refuge in San Marino for two days, narrowly escaping with his life, for which the Italians also felt indebted. During this war, San Marino took in 10,000 Italian refugees, saving lives, which almost led to a severe food shortage nationwide. However, from now on, the Italians will not forget the benefits they received and will provide support in various ways. Therefore, its national spirit can be symbolized by its flag, which is white and blue. White represents peace, and blue represents freedom. It features a national emblem in the middle, with a laurel branch on one side, representing honor, and a cypress branch on the other, representing military strength. Below is the Latin word "Libertas" (Freedom), above which is a crown, representing "sovereignty." Above the crown is a cross, representing universal love. Therefore, its national spirit can be summarized as "Peace, Freedom, Sovereignty, and Universal Love." During World War I, it declared war on Austria-Hungary out of a sense of justice. However, it was forgotten at the Paris Peace Conference and did not sign the treaty. During this war, it remained neutral throughout. Initially, the German commander in Italy, Kesselring, promised not to invade. However, in the last two months, the desperate German forces crossed the bridge and broke neutrality, entering its territory. Thus, part of the national territory became a battlefield. However, the capital was never invaded by any side. The most significant war damage was caused by the American bombing on June 26, 1944, which resulted in 60 deaths and injuries. After protesting to the United States, the U.S. acknowledged it as an unfortunate accident due to a miscalculation. The current government is rushing to complete three statistics: (1) War damage caused by the German army; (2) War damage caused by the British and American Allied forces; (3) Losses caused by the overall war impact. The second item is particularly important because it requires submitting a request for compensation to Britain and the United States.

(3) Government Organization

The Republic of San Marino has territory, people, and sovereignty, so it is recognized by the international community as an independent country. In addition to the constitution, it also has civil and criminal laws and regulations. The government organization is a three-branch system of executive, judicial, and legislative powers. It has two presidents, one elected by the residents of the capital and one elected by the residents of the towns. They are required to hold citizen reception hours from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM every Wednesday, where citizens can directly present their difficulties. The parliament is organized by sixty popularly elected parliamentarians, forming the highest legislative body. The judiciary is a three-level, three-trial system. There is also a State Council, composed of ten members elected by the parliament, serving as the highest executive body. Under the President, there is a Minister of Foreign Affairs, who oversees foreign affairs and internal affairs, as well as a Minister and Deputy Minister of Finance, who oversee internal affairs and finance. There are a total of 22 staff members. There are also ten bureaus, smaller in scale than ministries, for health, transportation, education, sports, public works, public drama, architecture, publishing, post office, and labor. Before the war, there was only one Fascist party in the country. Now, due to current trends, there are also three major political parties: the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and the Democratic Alliance. The first two are left-leaning, and the latter is right-leaning. The current two presidents, the one elected by the capital is from the Socialist Party, and the one elected by the towns is from the Communist Party. The term of office for both the presidents and the parliamentarians is half a year (the president is the ex officio speaker of the parliament), and elections are held every April 1 and October 1. Currently, out of the 60 parliamentarians, 40 are from the Socialist Party and the Communist Party, and the remaining 20 are from the Democratic Alliance (the ten members of the State Council are allocated by each party according to this proportion). Therefore, the country is currently ruled by the left-leaning parties. Former Fascist party officials have now been arrested and imprisoned for trial. In terms of international relations, it has ambassadors stationed in France and the Vatican. It has established consulates with Italy, Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium, the United States, France, and other countries. It has also participated in the International Agricultural Association (established in 1905, China is also a member), the Universal Postal Union, the International Red Cross, the International Radio Conference, the Paris Motor Traffic Conference, the Hague International Permanent Court, and others.

(4) Finance and Economy

The main source of national finance is the issuance of stamps. The country has been issuing stamps since 1877, and their beautiful designs are treasured by stamp collectors worldwide. In addition, it relies on tax revenue subsidies from the Italian government. San Marino is primarily an agricultural country, only producing wheat and wine. It produces 15,000 dan (approximately 750 tons) of wheat annually, and after consuming 12,000 dan themselves, it can export 3,000 dan annually. However, all daily necessities must be imported. To facilitate the import of Italian goods, it has an agreement with Italy that it does not set up customs checkpoints to levy taxes and does not issue paper currency but uses Italian currency. In return, the Italian government pays 25 million lire annually to subsidize its tax revenue. The last agreement was made in 1939, and it was recently revised once by Italian Prime Minister Gasperi. The main revision stipulates that San Marino cannot handle divorce procedures in the future. Because Italy is a Catholic country, according to Catholic doctrine, spouses cannot divorce unless specially approved by the Pope. Therefore, Italians seeking divorce go to San Marino to complete divorce procedures. The current Italian Prime Minister Gasperi is the leader of the Christian Democratic Party, and to remedy this situation, he made this amendment to stop the outflow of currency.

The country has 23 kilometers of highways and 32 kilometers of railways (with 16 tunnels), which are narrow-gauge railways with electric locomotives. They were donated by Mussolini in 1932, with a value of 48 million lire at the time (approximately 240,000 US dollars). After the outbreak of the war, they were destroyed by the Fascist party. Currently, it plans to issue public bonds to raise funds for repairs. The government owns 42 cars, one of which was used by the former president. The two current presidents each use one. Recently, one car was damaged and being repaired, so the two presidents shared one car. The Transportation Bureau issues approximately 400 R.S.M. (Republic of San Marino abbreviation) license plates, which are valid in all countries worldwide. Because the annual license plate tax is only 1,000 lire (approximately 4 US dollars), which is cheaper than in Italy, many Italians nearby apply for licenses in San Marino.

(5) National Life

There is no military service or taxation in the country. There are only 300 volunteer soldiers and 12 military police, who are borrowed from the Italian government. The president's honorary honor guard of 32 people is an honorary position held by nobles. Therefore, the economic burden on citizens is extremely light, but it is extremely difficult to obtain its citizenship. Ordinary entry is limited to three days. Beyond three days, it must be reported to the government for approval. According to law, those who apply for citizenship are limited to those born within San Marino who are 21 years old. However, few are approved. But recently, the left-leaning government has slightly relaxed the nationality law, stating that anyone who has lived in San Marino for 40 years can apply for citizenship. After this happens, about 300 people will qualify for citizenship, and the left-leaning parties will therefore gain 300 more votes. It can be seen that even such a small country as San Marino cannot avoid the overwhelming trend of the modern world. The country awards honorary citizenship to those who have contributed to humanity and the country. Mussolini was awarded honorary citizenship for donating 32 kilometers of railways, and Marconi was awarded honorary citizenship for inventing radio. Recently, the parliament is discussing awarding honorary citizenship to former U.S. President Roosevelt, which will be announced soon.

Because the whole country lives and works in peace, the public order is extremely good, with a prevalence of not picking up lost items and not locking doors at night. The entire country has only nine prisoners, four of whom are Fascist political prisoners, and the other five are thieves. All must be stripped of their citizenship and deported after serving their sentences. National compulsory education is implemented nationwide, with primary school lasting five years and eight schools (one in each town), junior high school lasting five years and one school, and senior high school lasting three years, all located in the capital. There is also an orphanage with 28 orphans, which I visited for a week. It was neatly arranged and quite large in scale. In addition, there is a modern hospital (with 150 beds), three cinemas, and one theater, all run by the state. The architecture is magnificent, and the facilities are excellent. There are three newspapers nationwide. One is the "Titano Bi-Monthly," hosted by the Socialist Party, with a circulation of 2,000 copies per issue, the most widely circulated. The second is the "Great Bell Monthly," hosted by the Democratic Alliance, and the third is the "Mars Bi-Monthly," hosted by the Communist Party. Recently, the Democratic Alliance criticized the government in the "Great Bell Monthly" for lacking a thorough plan for issuing stamps, and it believes that the government overdrafted the budget by 2 million lire (approximately 7,000 US dollars) without legal procedures, which is illegal and improper. However, the government stated that government finances have been greatly affected by the depreciation of the lira in recent years. Recently, it plans to hire financial experts in Rome to study taxation methods to inject capital. It can be seen that the devastation of this war is so deep that even a small country like San Marino is affected by it. The so-called paradise on earth is no longer to be found anywhere. The national capital is located on the mountain peak, overlooking the entire territory. The mountain peak is extremely high, and a bell tower is built. There is one large bell and one small bell. The large bell tells the hour, and the small bell tells the quarter hour. The sound of the bell can be heard throughout the country, so people do not need to wear watches. After staying overnight, I quietly departed in the faint morning light amid the melodious sounds of the bells!

### Sunday Forum: The Problem of Atomic Bomb Defense

— Zhao Zengjue

—Fifth Discussion on the Atomic Bomb Problem—

1.  The Power of the Atomic Bomb

Although atomic bombs have only been formally used twice, the actual manifestation of their power has shocked the world! A single atomic bomb can destroy a large city, making all other weapons pale in comparison. This leap forward surpasses mankind's improvements in weaponry over the past several hundred years. It is not only unprecedentedly destructive, but its radioactivity can persist for a considerable period, causing animals to develop internal changes and die unknowingly without apparent external injuries. It has been nine months since the atomic bombs fell on Japan, and Japanese hospitals still have many people being treated for invisible wounds, which is clear evidence. According to recent reports, the latest American atomic bomb is over a thousand times more powerful than the ones dropped on Japan, with a destructive force equivalent to a million ordinary ten-ton bombs. Its power is still being researched and expanded. The test scheduled by the United States to be held on Bikini Atoll on July 1 has the potential to destroy an entire fleet in one fell swoop. From the invention of the atomic bomb to today, only a year has passed. It is reported that, under the efforts of American scientists, the production raw materials have increased sixfold, and the manufacturing cost has been reduced by half. Within a few years, any country with a scientific and industrial foundation can also imitate it. Without appropriate controls, mankind's calamity is just beginning, and the end of the world may not be far away!

In addition to material destruction, there is also psychological threat. In the event of a conflict, any hostile country's location is likely to be hit by an atomic bomb. People who sleep soundly tonight do not know if they will still exist in the world tomorrow. This feeling of uneasiness can completely paralyze a country's institutions, so how can we talk about "freedom from fear"!

2.  Active Defense

The only active defense is to repel enemy planes carrying atomic bombs and prevent them from flying over our country. The advancement of radar can accurately measure the arrival of enemy planes, allowing our powerful air force to intercept them outside our borders. However, the sky is so vast that it is impossible to prevent any enemy plane from sneaking into our country's airspace. Any intrusion by an enemy plane can determine our country's fate. At the beginning of the European theater in World War II, Hitler of Germany boasted that he would not allow an enemy plane to enter German airspace, but what was the reality? Except for a short period, Allied planes were almost always present in German airspace. All those who study air defense have not yet discovered an effective method of active air defense. Perhaps one day in the future, the aircraft of warring nations will take off simultaneously, and by the time they complete their missions and return to their countries, they will each discover that their important cities have been destroyed!

Moreover, missiles (i.e., guided missiles) or unmanned aircraft are constantly being improved, making it easy to accurately attack enemy targets with radio control. In the future, they will inevitably use planes carrying atomic bombs, in high-altitude and high-speed formations, to attack the other side in groups of hundreds or thousands. At that time, it will be impossible to defend. The only effective solution is for the entire country to strive to research science and develop industry, so that our country can also manufacture its own atomic bombs and missiles and other new weapons, so that the enemy is afraid of our retaliatory measures and dare not easily use atomic bombs. For example, poison gas was not tried by the Axis powers in World War II. This is because the Allied powers could also produce poison gas, and the Axis powers had concerns and dared not use it easily. This proves that "an eye for an eye" is indeed the most proactive and effective method of preventing atomic bombs.

3.  Passive Defense

What about passive defense? The only way is to disperse as much as possible to reduce the potential for damage. The entire country can be divided into several self-sufficient regions, and each city should preferably not have an excessive population. Cities with hundreds of thousands of people or more should be divided into several central areas, each with sufficient self-sufficiency in industry, commerce, water, and electricity. Cities with large populations, such as Shanghai, should be divided into at least three or five central areas, with gaps between each central area based on the range of each atomic bomb's destructive power. If there are natural mountain barriers, they should be used as intervals between the areas.

Based on the experience of World War II, more people died from burns than from shrapnel. The firestorm caused by bombs can engulf people and cities at a speed of ninety miles per hour. In addition to being directly burned to death by the flames, many people also died due to lack of oxygen or exposure to carbon monoxide poisoning. Therefore, some people advocate that air defense buildings should be built on five- to seven-story buildings to reduce the invasion of flames and have heat protection and ventilation equipment. However, it is doubtful whether ordinary buildings can withstand the explosive force of atomic bombs, and the high heat of atomic bombs is far beyond that of ordinary incendiary bombs. Therefore, if there is sufficient oxygen storage in underground facilities, it is undoubtedly the most effective method of defending against bombs. Important factories should be built underground, and perhaps in the future all important buildings—factories, warehouses, and transportation facilities—will be hidden hundreds of feet underground.

In addition to the thousands of times greater destructive force and high heat of atomic bombs compared to ordinary bombs or incendiary bombs, they also have their unique radioactive destructive power. Future buildings must have equipment to defend against radioactivity.

4.  Conclusion

The active and passive defenses mentioned above are not absolutely effective methods. Some people still believe that for every offensive weapon, there will be a corresponding defensive weapon. But in the atomic age, I am afraid that there is no weapon in the world that can overcome the atomic bomb. The only safe and effective way is to permanently eliminate the suspicions and hatred that lead to war, and it is best to eliminate all national, ethnic, religious, and belief boundaries and form a world government, with atomic energy controlled by the world government. Then people can forget the word "war" and no longer engage in killing. All enlightened people believe that this ideal is urgent. U.S. President Wilson had already cried out loudly thirty years ago. Unfortunately, the suspicions between countries are not easy to eliminate, and the League of Nations is weak and ineffective, existing in name only, ultimately leading to the outbreak of World War II. Although the war is over now, no one can say for sure whether the United Nations organization is much stronger than the League of Nations. However, in the atomic age today, mankind has reached a crossroads of destruction and happiness, and it is no longer just talking about ideals, but seeking how to realize them without further delay. It can be said that the promotion of mankind's "self-awareness" is also the highest achievement of social science.

According to the current situation, optimism is not allowed. A sense of narrow security based on nationality and country is still deeply rooted in the minds of people in various countries, and the shadow of aggression still extends to every corner of the world. Humans are truly strange animals, experiencing pain but still wanting to experience pain, creating civilization but still wanting to destroy civilization! Therefore, our people should not rely solely on the United Nations organization to an excessive degree without any preparation, and we cannot ignore "reality" based solely on "ideals." We must quickly unite and work together to promote the science and industry that should be researched and built in the atomic age to protect the safety of the country and the nation. The current atomic bomb uses "uranium" as its main raw material, which is extracted from carnotite or pitchblende. The main production areas of these two minerals are currently Africa, the Belgian Congo, Denver in the United States, Silesia in Germany, the Ural Mountains in the Soviet Union, and Guangxi and southern Jiangxi in our country. If our country researches and manufactures atomic bombs, there is no need to worry about a shortage of raw materials. Only if we can manufacture atomic bombs can we prevent others from threatening us with atomic bombs.

Britain is a country that is purely advanced in science, and she also participated in leading the invention of the atomic bomb. But being mindful of danger in times of peace, it has not relaxed its preparations for protecting the safety of the British Empire. This time, mobilizing scientists across the country to engage in scientific research is nothing more than targeting the manufacture of atomic bombs and atomic bomb defense. Considering this, it is not difficult for the people of our country to choose which way we should go. We believe that only nationwide sincere cooperation and efforts in scientific research and industrial construction is the only way to achieve national security!

### Loan Sharks Exploiting Rice Scarcity!

To the Editor: Post-victory Shanghai is a place where almost every family lacks rice and grain. Only those engaged in large-scale business and the wealthy are using their intellect and skill to enrich themselves, creating a stark contrast to the common people who toil diligently with pale faces. Now, they are exploiting the rice shortage by lending rice at exorbitant interest rates: for every 160 catties of rice lent, 240 catties of rice (including principal and interest) must be repaid after the autumn harvest. Such high interest for a mere three months! The common people are unwilling to bear such a burden, but hunger forces them to borrow. The common people are being forced to yield to the pressures of life! For example, a commoner who cultivates ten acres of land, with a family of five, might need to borrow 200 catties of rice this year. If the harvest is good, each acre might yield 200 catties of rice, giving them 2000 catties in total. After repaying the 300 catties (principal and interest), they would have 1700 catties left. The five people in the family would need at least 1500 catties of rice for the year. This leaves only 200 catties, and that does not include miscellaneous expenses. These 200 catties can only be used to buy some fertilizer, so they will still be short on expenses. How will they ever be able to repay their debts? If things continue like this, I fear the bankruptcy of the rural areas is not far off! I am a poor teacher, earning just over 20,000 (currency unspecified) a month, but even that is often in arrears. The county government is said to be short of money. That meager amount can only buy 60 catties of rice, which is hardly enough for one person's sustenance, let alone supporting a family. Therefore, I have had to endure the suffering of borrowing with heavy interest, as described above! So this is what they mean by the "rich and abundant region of Jiangnan!" Respectfully submitted by Wu Xiangshan, teacher at Hexi National Primary School, Shanghai County.

### Strengthening Public Opinion Sanctions

Dear Editor: Readers often have no way to express their opinions on political and social issues. Although your newspaper has a "Reader Opinions" section, it is too small, and many submissions are verbose. I propose several ideas. After gaining public agreement, please allocate a larger space so that readers have a place to speak and voice their grievances. The following are my suggestions: (1) Suggestions or discussions on the merits and demerits of local (or regional) political facilities should be allowed to help alleviate suffering. (2) Verifiable complaints of unreasonable bullying or extortion should be reported. (3) Information related to social disorder and cases threatening the lives of residents should be exposed as much as possible to attract public scrutiny. (4) Submissions must be based on facts, with authentic signatures and no false accusations or personal attacks. (5) The language must be concise, avoiding lengthy and redundant prose, to prevent depriving others of the space to express their views. (6) This column aims to raise the voices of the people, strengthen the sanction of public opinion, and express genuine public sentiment.

### Tiger Hill Flower Farmers Petition for Tax Exemption

To the Editor: Respected Sir, in the Tiger Hill area of Wu County, approximately one thousand households, large and small, make a living by growing camellias. They are normally diligent and thrifty, working hard to make a living. These camellias, including bitter oranges, jasmine, and white orchids, are agricultural products and are therefore exempt from taxes. However, since the start of the Anti-Japanese War, during the eight years of occupation, the people have suffered under the enemy's tyranny, subjected to seizure and plunder. The harm to flower farmers has been especially severe. As late as October of the thirty-second year of the Republic, a person named Gu Shunhua, abusing the enemy's power, attempted to extort the villagers and destroy the rural economy by creating a special camellia tax. As the flower business is agricultural and exempt from taxation, flower farmers rose in protest. Fearing unrest and unable to defy public opinion, the puppet government pretended to care about the flower farmers and ordered the tax abolished. Then, in the spring of the thirty-third year of the Republic, Japanese businessmen Oyama Mitsuhiro and Matsumoto Okio came to the area and founded the Dahua Foreign Firm, oppressing the flower farmers and attempting to control the industry. The flower farmers initially resisted, leading the Japanese Matsumoto Okio to beat the flower farmer Wang Jufu. Because Mr. Wang was old and weak, he lost too much blood and died despite medical treatment. This is a fact showing the loyalty of our Tiger Hill flower farmers to the region and to the government, worthy of praise and tears. For eight long years, we lived in dire circumstances, awaiting the light. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been won, everyone is celebrating with joy. But suddenly, on May 29th, we saw in Suzhou newspapers that the Wu County Council meeting included a proposal from the county government to levy a special camellia tax, which had already been approved by the provincial government. The flower farmers were terrified. Our flower business suffered greatly during the enemy occupation. Now that the rural economy is on the verge of collapse, we urgently need the government to provide assistance, increase production, and restore our former business. We were very hopeful. Moreover, according to Suzhou newspapers on April 11th, the Ministry of Finance has strictly prohibited local governments at all levels from levying taxes on goods, as the regulations are incompatible. Furthermore, agricultural products have never been included in standard taxation. In addition to submitting a petition to the authorities requesting exemption from this harsh camellia tax, we are specifically appealing to all sectors of society to uphold justice and provide assistance. We are sincerely grateful. Sincerely, all the flower farmers of Tiger Hill, Wu County.

### Understanding

— Shao Fu

A person has an inner pain that cannot be represented by superficial smiles. You see that a person is outwardly happy and joyful; if you think that they are truly happy and joyful, then you are mistaken, because you have not penetrated the inner layer of that person's life.

The Russian literary giant Tolstoy died in a foreign land. His last words were: "Water in a bucket, too full, too full, too full, it will overflow." The bucket cannot act as a barrier.

This is the last sigh of a soul, and the most painful cry of human nature. Because, because of the one person in the world he loved most, he understood that he had despaired of her; she could not understand him. He left, at the age of seventy, and died in a foreign land. However, his great and brilliant achievements in the world, even in the centuries before and after, cannot compensate for the tragedy he personally experienced.

Understanding a person is not an easy thing!

As in the example above, even after decades of marriage, it is not possible. How can one say it is possible for an ordinary friend?

### Go to Changshu

— Cao Zuo Han

Perhaps I am not yet qualified to describe Changshu, because I have only been there for a few days. I have not yet familiarized myself with the roads, so how can I write an impression piece?

However, precisely because I am unfamiliar, I can still write something. Once I become familiar, I will be assimilated, and I will see black as white, and there will be nothing to say.

I remember when I first went to Wujiang, I felt that Wujiang had two characteristics: many crows and few beggars. However, the old residents of Wujiang would never think about this, let alone be surprised by it. Just as those who live in Suzhou spend their days crowded in Guanqian, sitting in Beiju, and relaxing in Wu Yuan, they never appreciate the poetic charm of Suzhou, which is found in the cold alleys.

Enough small talk. Changshu's scenery is famous for Yushan Mountain. Being famous is not necessarily good; this is also a strange thing. The fun place is not Yushan Mountain, but Poshang Mountain outside the North Gate. With Dianfu Temple as its center, the mountain up and down, in front and behind the temple, has the flavor of a corner of West Lake. There you can see waterfalls, much better than Taoyuan Stream. Generally, Taoyuan is secluded, while this place is bright. Taoyuan Stream is hidden in overgrown weeds, and it is indeed difficult to find without the guidance of locals—some locals do not even know about it.

"Wang Si Restaurant's Beggar's Chicken" and "Shi Family Restaurant's Fatty Lung Soup" are equally famous. Wang Si Restaurant is also near Poshang Mountain. I once made a special trip to patronize it, but I didn't get to eat chicken, I didn't get to eat rice, I didn't get to eat dishes, all there was was wine. The signboard was gold, but my two legs suffered, and my mouth didn't feel comfortable.

Yushan Mountain is in the city. Nearby are the tombs of Yan Zi and Zhong Yong. The tombstones are incomplete and unreadable, covered in bird droppings and animal excrement. The ancients are certainly playing a joke, but the locals don't say it's unpleasant. There is a pavilion on the top of the mountain called "Zhen Jiao," which means "Suppressing the Dragon." According to ancient mythology, the immortal Xu Zhenren suppressed a dragon here, which is related to the feng shui of the entire county. A more recent myth says that after the enemy army occupied Changshu, they built fortifications on the mountain and planned to dig a tunnel in the pavilion. As a result, they dug up an ancient well. At the edge of the well was a thick iron chain. The enemy army pulled it up, very long, and pulled up an old ape with white hair, jumping and leaping, with no trace of water on its body. The enemy army saw this as a miracle and respectfully sent it back into the well. It is said that the iron chain and the old ape are still in the well in the pavilion.

Out of curiosity and wanting to see the whole city, I climbed to the top of Yushan Mountain. Who knew that there were soldiers guarding the pavilion? I was driven out before I could even enter. This was an unexpected encounter. From a glance, I managed to see Shanghu Lake. The houses inside and outside the city were densely packed, interspersed with patches of green trees. The people of Jiangnan are fortunate after all. If you look at the north bank of the Yangtze River from the top of Jinshan Pagoda in Zhenjiang, it is extremely desolate, like the vast and boundless lands north of the Yellow River. It is a pity that in such a poor place, the people have enjoyed the "blessing" of "liberation" and still millions are fleeing to Jiangnan. The National Government has returned to its capital, but when will these wanderers be able to return to their homes!

The folk customs here are very simple and generous. Just look at the number of people drinking alcohol, and you can imagine. As the sun sets, with a cup in hand, amidst the salted fish sauce, meat, and peanuts, they have reached their own paradise.

The rice wine is brewed very well, but it is no longer in season. Otherwise, I would very much like to empty my pockets and buy a drunken stupor. Such is the spectacle of life. I am neither a hero nor a superman. Being awake seems more uncomfortable than being drunk. This is not a complaint.

### Impressions of Taiwanese Women

— Xiao Jianmin

Taiwanese women's clothing is unusually brightly colored, and the styles are all original. Perhaps this is a symbol of depression! However, they don't like to wear kimonos. They usually wear skirts or dresses. They also wear evening gowns at banquets. In the mainland, ladies can get by for a long time with two or three qipaos made of Shilin cloth. This is not the case here. Not to mention housewives, decoration is their profession. Even working women, female workers, or maids have to change clothes three or four times a day. They always carry a rush grass bag to work. The things in the bag are a lunch box, a piece of clothing, and a side dish or a book. They take a break in the morning, open their lunch box for lunch, take a bath after lunch, and change clothes after bathing. Factories and agencies here almost all have bathing facilities. Although the clothes are brightly colored, they are not gaudy or vulgar. The patterns and styles are simply too numerous, and the coloring is bright and dazzling. Some dresses have only one flower occupying the entire area; some dresses are covered with insects, fish, flowers, and plants. It is said to be the crystallization of Japan's economic development: rayon has a soft color and texture, is mass-produced, and is sold at a low price. At this time, cotton cloth is about thirty yuan per foot, while rayon is only about 120 yuan per yard. In my hometown of Hunan, a piece of coarse blue government-made cloth can be worn for a lifetime and can be left as an inheritance for a son to wear. Rayon cannot do that; at most, it lasts a year. Beautiful fibers will eventually collapse, unlike coarse blue government-made cloth, which can be mended when it is broken and can be worn for another ten or twenty years. I have not been to the Paris fashion center, but based on my impressions of watching French movies, I feel that Parisian women's clothing is far less novel and bizarre than here.

At first glance, there seem to be more women than men here. Low-level occupational workers in agencies and organizations are all women. Female workers in factories are usually twice as many as male workers. Hotel attendants, food service attendants, and shop clerks are all women. It can be seen that gender equality in employment is indeed realized. To achieve this in the mainland, it may take thirty to fifty years, or at least ten to twenty years. They are generally healthy, love cleanliness, and iron their clothes neatly, covering themselves in colorful garments. But inside? They all seem to have endless loneliness and melancholy. Some female workers go to the factory at the age of ten, and when their daughters are ten years old, they also go to the factory. The days pass year after year in the sound of the whistle in the morning and afternoon. In other companies and government offices, it is common to see the owner of a document change from a young woman to a middle-aged woman to an aging woman. These subtle things are probably impossible to say. So whenever they have free time, they sing. After dusk, the whole city sings, radios sing, phonographs sing. It is truly a music city. Young people like excitement and naturally find the environment beautiful, but we, who have just come from a quiet city, find it a bit too noisy. (Sent from Taipei on the 18th.)

### Cold Drink Exhibition Hall

— Ying Dai

Astronomers have predicted that there will be no summer this year. We don't feel anything about it, but cold drink merchants will jump up in fright. If there really is no summer, then the sales of cold drinks will be a cold case and will be frozen in the cold palace forever. But looking at the situation in the past few days, the sun is high, and the asphalt pavement starts to melt at noon. There is summer after all. The astronomers are talking nonsense. The cold drink merchants turn their worry into joy, stop crying and start laughing, and cheer up to focus on their business.

Indeed, summer is the world of cold drinks. Roadsides and streets are filled with cold drinks. It starts in early summer and only quiets down after the Mid-Autumn Festival, lasting such a long time. During the entire cold drink season, Shanghai people don't know how much money they spend on cold drinks. Otherwise, why would there be so many cold drink vendors on the street corners? Unfortunately, there are no accurate statistics. Otherwise, the numbers for this expenditure would be very impressive.

The cold drink market changes with the weather. The cold drink market suddenly becomes active as the weather warms up in the last few days. In Shanghai, the "Paris of the East", the largest cold drink factory is the American-owned Ha Ning Foreign Firm. The factory is located in Hongkou. During the Japanese occupation, it was damaged, and some of the machines were moved or destroyed. But after several months of reorganization after the victory, its products are now (relatively quickly) preparing to supply cold drinks to food stores throughout the city in the fastest way possible during the entire cold drink season.

Speaking of Ha Ning Foreign Firm's cold drinks, one will unconsciously think of the Beauty Brand. The Beauty Brand is Ha Ning Foreign Firm's special logo. All of Ha Ning Foreign Firm's products are marked with the Beauty Brand, and the yellow refrigerators displayed at cigarette shops and fruit stalls are also marked with the Beauty Brand. It is said that these refrigerators were acquired before the war and are now scarce commodities. Existing tenants are unwilling to terminate or sublease them to others.

To get a bird's-eye view of Shanghai's cold drink market, most cigarette shops and fruit stalls operate both businesses, and food stores have also set up elegant seating areas called ice drinking rooms. Flags are hung at the door, fluttering in the wind, creating a new atmosphere. In other places, such as dance halls, bars, movie theaters, and Peking opera theaters, cold drinks are also available for people to choose from, and cold drink locations are also set up in several parks. In this way, wherever we go, if we want to cool off and quench our thirst, we don't have to worry about not being able to buy cold drinks.

There are many food stores in the Great World area, and in the summer, it becomes a concentrated cold drink market. General food stores have all been renovated and have elegant seating areas for cold drinks. Several Cantonese restaurants even display all the ice cream making machines and manufacture them in public. A store near the YMCA that sells Beijing sour plum soup is even more famous. On hot days, young men and women queue up all day long to buy sour plum soup.

Looking at the streets, wherever there are many pedestrians, there are cold drink stalls every few steps, set up in the open air. Tables are full of soda, fresh orange juice, Coca-Cola, etc. Soda can be served with an opening fee, in large cups or small cups, as you wish, and stands across the street from the tea sellers. These are the places where coolies and rickshaw pullers cool off and quench their thirst, appearing on the streets every year on this day.

Looking at the goods prepared by various cold drink vendors, from ice cream, fresh orange juice, popsicles, Snow White, soda, shaved ice to herbal tea, jelly, mung bean soup, and earth cream, a blend of Chinese and Western styles, everything is available, as if Shanghai has a cold drink exhibition hall!

### Little Bear

— Zhu Wei

A newborn bear is very small compared to the proportion of other newborn animals to their mothers. It is only eight or nine inches long and weighs only twelve or fifteen ounces. The mother bear often weighs around 500 pounds. So the weight of a newborn bear is only one-five hundredth of the mother's weight. In humans, the weight of an infant is often one-twentieth of the mother's weight.

According to statistics from the American Camel Cigarette Company: Each pound of tobacco can make 350 cigarettes.

### Serial Comics - Sanmao Joins the Army (Twenty-Eight)

### Night Stroll

— Li Lingzhi

Taking a stroll on the night streets, I thought of a kind of morbid condition in our women.

When they are alive, they cannot distinguish between millet and wheat, and when they die, they still cannot distinguish between black and white. There are still many women like this today. This is a heartbreaking fact.

To cure this "female morbidity", I think we need to use the "open door to see the mountain" method.

"Open door to see the mountain" is a very straightforward method, calling on our girls not to be confined to the inner chambers, not to be limited to the classroom, not to be stuck in the kitchen. Open the door and go out, and you can see the lofty and majestic mountains. This mountain is the society we come into contact with. For example, if your home is on Shanghai's Avenue Joffre or Nanjing Road, you can see, on the street, that the mountain is certainly not there, but you can see a "wordless book". Most noticeable: In the evening, dancers and prostitutes gather in groups and dance wildly in the streets. You will naturally see the bright lights and goods shining in the windows of many department stores: glass handbags, glass socks, various cosmetics, genuine and fake DDT, with a wide variety of styles. Then you will think about how dancers and prostitutes are produced? Especially today, when there are loud calls to ban dancing and abolish prostitution, what kind of way out will these poor women find? On the same night street, all kinds of situations and all kinds of people will come into your view: A forty or fifty-year-old woman, as thin as a rake, nibbles on the bark of old plane trees next to the trees. As you watch with fascination or sympathy, a ragged old man suddenly runs towards you from the other end, extending his hand to beg for food, and you may be startled. In a corner that the streetlights do not illuminate, something like a stray dog rummages through the garbage. When you walk closer, you realize that it is a thirty-four-year-old middle-aged woman, naked and in rags, scavenging there. Children under the age of fifteen or sixteen pull empty carts and solicit business from you. Beautiful ladies and misses sit in Austin cars and act spoiled to their husbands or fathers. Teenage girls sell flowers to American soldiers with pleading expressions, saying "Best Flower" and "Thank you" Although they speak a pidgin English, it is clear that they have been temporarily trained several times. Dressed in fancy clothes, prostitutes and street girls shuttle back and forth like weavers.

Pay attention! This is a lesson in society! What you read in school turns into real life here. For your own life, you can live and develop with confidence, and there will be no more things happening against your will. Why fear that reading living books will make you a female beggar, a nun, a dancer, a prostitute, or a female traitor?

### Star-East Football Match - Revenue of 20 Million Yuan

— Feng Yi

The match between Star-East and the British Navy attracted over ten thousand spectators, a true spectacle in the football world. It has been nearly ten years since a Hong Kong team last visited Shanghai. This time, with a strong new lineup, they presented themselves to Shanghai fans, adding much-needed excitement to Shanghai's long-dormant football scene.

In terms of "business sense" derived from "attendance," the match was a success, generating revenue of over 20 million yuan. Aside from the diverse crowd of spectators, whose details are too numerous to mention, Mayor Wu Guozhen also made a brief appearance, arriving ten minutes before the game started. However, he quietly departed after the opening ceremony, spending no more than twenty minutes at the venue. Former star player Zhang Rongcai was also in attendance, appearing with a plump face and a bulky figure, a far cry from his former agility. It is said that since Zhang's union with the dancer Li Xiaomei, his heart has broadened and his body has grown larger, a credit to Li's influence.

Star-East originally intended to invite Li Huitang to join them on this trip to Shanghai, and Li initially agreed. However, as Li was a pillar of South China Football Club, the club inevitably had some reservations about showing favoritism. Therefore, Li Huitang ultimately decided to consider the bigger picture, unwilling to act alone, and the plan was abandoned. From a business perspective, Li's absence undoubtedly resulted in a slight loss of "ticket" revenue.

Among the thirteen members of the Star-East team, if we were to impartially rank them based on their football skills, the goalkeeper Zhu Zhaoheng should be placed "dead last." Recalling Zhu's performance during the war, he was a second-rate figure in Hong Kong, a B-team player. Ultimately, his experience is lacking, and his skills are not refined enough, so we cannot be too demanding. His "boss," Zhu Chizi, was originally a famous sports reporter for the "South China Daily." After the Pacific War, he formally fell into disgrace, becoming an adjutant to the Wang puppet regime. After the victory, he was finally arrested and imprisoned for violating national law!

Brief Remarks

### The World Is Not Without Good People: Two Good Landlords in Nanjing

— Wuling Ren

Two people in Nanjing wrote to the Central Daily News: (1) Mr. Wu Weiyang: willing to rent out his spare house, with the rent determined by the tenant. (2) Mr. Hu Chufei: praising landlord Jin Yushan for treating tenants like family. This shows that the world is not without kind-hearted people, and Nanjing already has two of them.

The ceasefire, the drop in rice prices, and the end of labor strikes – these past few days seem to bring many good news. Some say it is "four blessings arriving at the door," hoping for one more to complete the set. In fact, if these three can be maintained permanently, all difficulties can be resolved easily.

Some compare housewives to thermometers, saying that a housewife with a bad temper casts a shadow over the family, making it uninhabitable. Conversely, warmth and vitality fill the house. Similarly, comparing a family to a region's climate, Kunming is the most cherished, while Guiyang and Chongqing are the most disliked. However, the extreme heat of South Africa is frightening, causing people to exclaim, "I can't take it!"

A delegation of dozens of National Assembly representatives from distant Tibet was hosted by the city government, having breakfast at Sullivan, lunch at the Lao Zhengxing restaurant in Xiyuan, visiting the City God Temple, watching Mei Lanfang's opera, and touring factories. It is said that they "felt quite entertained."

### Guilin: An Ominous Sign of Fall

— Fisherman

The enemy's atrocities of burning and killing in Guilin during the Xiang-Gui Campaign in the winter of 1944 still send chills down my spine to this day. During the late summer and early autumn, Guilin's Guidong Road, known as Bank Street, witnessed a peculiar sight every evening. Thousands of swallows would suddenly gather on the overhead power and telephone lines, chirping incessantly. They would roost there at night and scatter in the morning, seeming to seek shelter in the atmosphere of the banks and gold shops. It was unknown where these swallows came from, and their numbers increased daily. Initially, they only gathered at the crossroads of Zhengyang Road, but later spread to the surrounding areas. At the time, the elders of Guilin said that this was one of Guilin's auspicious signs, known as "auspicious birds." According to local lore, Guilin had three auspicious omens: the evergreen osmanthus in Bagui Hall, which was a blessing for the people of Guilin; the healthy elders on Mount Laoren, which was a sign of prosperity for the people of Guilin; and the constant chirping of birds on Houfu Street (Guidong Road), which was a symbol of good fortune for the people of Guilin. Little did they know that Guilin would soon fall, suffering unprecedented destruction. The so-called good fortune of the people of Guilin turned out to be the opposite. It was also heard that before the fall of Guilin, the howls of wolves could be heard all night long on Mount Qixing, sounding like weeping, extremely mournful. Only afterward did people realize that the abnormal appearance of swallows and wolves was not a sign of good fortune, but an omen of disaster. Could it be that animals also have a premonition of impending doom? This is truly inexplicable.

### H4: The World's Largest Airship

— Translated by Bao Zhongqi from Science News Letter

In the past, the world's largest airship was the "Mars," but now the United States is about to complete an airship three times heavier than the Mars, named H-4. The airship is 200 feet long, with a wingspan of 320 feet, powered by four 3,000-horsepower engines, and can carry 42 tons of gasoline.

The cargo hold is large enough to accommodate an airplane. For rescue purposes, the H-4 can accommodate 350 patients plus doctors, nurses, and medical equipment.

The airship has a long range and a speed of 175 miles per hour, requiring over a mile of runway for takeoff.

### Heartbeat

— Wei

The first to organize wartime news reporters was Montezuma II of Mexico (1480-1520), the last emperor of the Aztec people of Mexico.

If a person's lifespan is sixty years, then their heart will beat approximately 2,500,000,000 times in their lifetime.

According to recent reports, mayflies are the root cause of many asthma cases, carrying over two thousand hair-like scales on their bodies.

### Social Services: Answering Readers

Legal Inquiries

(1) Li Gan asks: My deceased grandfather had three sons. My father was the eldest son and had two sons. The eldest grandson is twenty years old, and the younger grandson, myself, has one son. The second son (second uncle) had one son, but both father and son are deceased, leaving only a daughter-in-law with no children. The third son (youngest uncle) has one son who is not yet an adult. Who inherits the property of the second son (second uncle), or is it divided equally? (The clan elders intend for my son to be the heir, is this permissible?) The second son's daughter-in-law is immoral. Can she be expelled, or if she cohabitates with a man, can her property be entirely claimed by the heir or divided equally?

[Lawyer Duanmu Kai replies] If the second uncle passed away before his son, then the son should inherit from the father, and the daughter-in-law should inherit from the son. However, the son's death must have occurred after the implementation of the inheritance section of the Civil Code on May 5, 1931, for this to apply. Because before the implementation of this section, spouses had no inheritance rights. After the abolition of ancestral temple inheritance, the title of adopted son no longer exists. Adopting another person's children as one's own must be done according to the free will of the adoptive parents.

(2) Zhang Dingzhong of Lin'an asks: In the winter of 1934, A mortgaged three city houses to B for twelve years. At the time of the mortgage, B paid 200 silver dollars. In 1939, A sold the houses outright to C, but the mortgage money was deducted from the selling price of A. Last winter, B's lease expired. C is responsible for redeeming the houses from B. If C redeems with 200 legal tender dollars, can B demand 200 silver dollars? Please advise.

[Lawyer Duanmu Kai replies] Regarding the situation you described, you can request the court to fairly assess and increase the payment in accordance with Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Lawsuits After the Restoration. There is no basis for redeeming with silver dollars.

(3) Li Yunzhu asks: In February 1943, Li purchased a house from Chen for 26,000 yuan in puppet Central Reserve Certificates, paying 24,500 yuan and owing 1,500 yuan, stating that it would be paid off after land survey. This was during the period of enemy occupation, and the matter was delayed until January 25 of this year. Now Chen claims that the outstanding 1,500 yuan must be calculated as 1,000 times in legal tender. Does the government have such a regulation? How should old currency be converted reasonably?

[Lawyer Duanmu Kai replies] Only the provisions of Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Lawsuits After the Restoration can be consulted.

Women and Family

### Talking About Clothing in Early Summer

— Li Pingxian

Women's clothing doesn't have strict rules. Whether you're stepping out for a bit or going to a banquet, you can wear whatever you like.

For most people, material is the standard: good material means good clothes, beautiful design means beautiful clothes. Actually, warmth is first, aesthetics second, and price should not be a standard for beauty. Because between people, or in social situations, the goal isn't to judge wealth or hold a fashion competition to show off.

It's early summer now. If you wear a plain, soft blue silk dress to a summer evening banquet, along with shoes of nearly the same color, you're guaranteed to look gentle, elegant, and win the appreciation of friends and family under the soft lighting. Conversely, even if you wear elaborate, priceless trendy silk, it might give friends and family an unpleasant or unattractive feeling, because it's really not appropriate for an evening party.

### German Husband, Russian Wife: Chinese Court Grants Divorce

—

German national Tus Furv Lawan, 40 years old, and Russian woman Nikola Mina, 31 years old, married in Tianjin in April 1934. They lived together at No. 9 Qingdao Road, Tenth District of Tianjin and were registered with a foreign official. Now, the two have incompatible feelings and can no longer live together, so they asked the Soviet Consulate in Tianjin for a consensual divorce. The consulate stated that, in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty, it was difficult to break the relationship without proof from a Chinese court. The two then hired lawyer Fan Duobiao and filed a lawsuit with the court requesting a consensual divorce. On the afternoon of the 28th, the court summoned the two and a settlement was reached, with three articles of agreement attached. The divorce certificate stated: 1. The divorce is mutually desired and there will be no future disturbance. 2. After the divorce, the two parties will be strangers and free to marry as they wish. 3. The two parties are divorced unconditionally, and neither party may claim any rights.

This is a small demonstration of China's improved international standing.

### New British Laundry Machine; Women in Disaster Areas Have No Clothes

— Han

A new type of automatic dry-cleaning machine has been invented in a British factory. According to the "Engineer" quarterly, this machine is designed to make the washing process fully automatic from beginning to end. You simply place the clothes to be washed in a rotating body, and the processes of dirt removal, drying, and disinfection are all automatic. There are three types of machines, large and small, each capable of washing 30, 60, or 90 pounds of clothes. Unfortunately, many Chinese girls can't afford clothes. The machines may be good, but they can't afford them.

### Beautiful Lady's Big Campaign; Husband Becomes a Judge

— Han

The beautiful Mrs. Aston, 29 years old, dreamed of two things after the victory: first, to get her husband (a lieutenant) stationed overseas out of military service, and second, to help her husband get an ideal job after his return. This time, to elect a judge (a six-year term with an annual salary of $6,000), she thought it was a good opportunity and immediately began campaigning.

She went out and asked the public for help, which finally aroused great interest among the general public. The results revealed that her husband was "victorious right from the start."

The Chinese have a saying, "The husband sings, the wife follows." The Americans now have "The wife sings, the husband follows."

### The Fruit of Divorce

— Qingguang

Mrs. A: "I heard you've decided to get a divorce? Have you divided the property?"

Mrs. B: "It's already divided. I took my children. My husband took the house."

Mrs. A: "Then how was the money divided?"

Mrs. B: "That's the lawyer's."

### Don't Play Small Games!

Great modern women should have strength like a carved statue in their hearts, a thoughtful sensitivity on their faces, and spiritual depth in their eyes. In her new book "Challenge to Female Compatriots," the famous American female writer Annie Meyer pointed out that American women lack the above qualities. At the same time, she said that the personalities of women in other countries are developing, and great achievements can be expected in the future. But American women seem to have become "finished products."

She also gained some inspiration from the conversations of two returning veterans: The only thing American women are interested in about men is what they can get from them. Here and there, they are either squeezing to buy nylon stockings or patiently lining up in long queues to buy a few loaves of bread. In short, she believes that modern women's horizons shouldn't be so narrow and they shouldn't just play small games with themselves or the men around them. Look at the wider world!

I think this view can also be given to my country's sisters.

Expand the horizons of women

### A Word Killed Cao E

— Wenxia

During the reign of Emperor Shun of the Han Dynasty, there was a family named Cao in Shangyu (now Shangyu County, Zhejiang Province), who had only a father and daughter who depended on each other for life. The family was very poor and relied on fishing for a living. The daughter, named E, was only fourteen years old. She was clever, lively, physically strong, and had a strong personality. Although her father was middle-aged, his hair was already gray due to years of overwork. Although Cao E was young, she knew how to comfort her father. She often stroked her father's white hair and said confidently:

"Dad, don't dislike me because I'm a girl. I'll definitely do something better than men for you to see in the future."

"Is that why you're secretly going to the pond behind us to learn how to swim? Is that doing something better than men?" The father said this with a straight face, without a smile.

"Dad, don't blame me. Learning to swim isn't a bad thing. You have to do the god-jumping on May 5th (god-jumping is to welcome the god Wu Jun in the river. Wu Jun Shen is Wu Zixu, who was killed by King Fucha of Wu and thrown into the river. Later people worshiped him as a god). You're old and have no son. If I learn to swim, I can do it for you in the future."

"Silly girl, you're a woman, how can you do things to worship gods?" Dad said, shaking his head and waving his hands.

Although Dad loved his daughter very much, he didn't agree with her showy behavior. He wanted her to be a gentle and refined girl. Cao E's little heart was also a little unhappy that her dad didn't understand her and stopped her freedom. Therefore, even though her father didn't agree, she still secretly learned to swim. When May 5th arrived, Dad went to perform the god-jumping again, but this year he wasn't feeling well and lost his footing, getting swept away by a wave. Cao E was standing on the shore, watching. She immediately wanted to jump into the water to save her father, but was held back by a crowd of people. They all said, "The water is deep and the waves are big. Your father was unfortunately swept away by the tide. Why would you want to let her go to her death?"

Cao E cried her heart out, but no one was willing to let her jump into the water. She watched her father being swallowed up by the wind and waves, and the group of people who saw her as useless still held her back, so she was extremely angry.

She thought, it was the waves that swept her father away, and it was this group of men who looked down on her that killed her father. Now that she couldn't save her living father, she had to find her father's body.

With this determination, she waited by the river day and night. Sixteen days passed, but she still hadn't found her father's body. On the morning of the seventeenth day, she went to her mother's grave and said sadly:

"Mom, if you have a spirit, you should help your poor daughter find her father. If I can't find my father's body today, I'm going to jump into the river to find him."

She left the grave and went to the river again. She searched more carefully that day, but still couldn't find the body. Until the sun was about to set, a group of villagers came to the river to wash their farm tools. One of the young men with particularly sharp eyes spotted a pile of black stuff on the far side of the river. So they went with Cao E to look for it. When Cao E saw this pile of things, she didn't care if it was her father's body or not, and jumped into the river. This pile of dark things was indeed her father's body, so she jumped into the river. This pile of dark things was indeed her father's body. She hugged the body and swam close to the shore, but a meddling youth shouted.

"Hugging a man face-to-face, what is that supposed to look like."

Cao E heard the criticism in the water and was so ashamed that her anger rose. She immediately turned the body over, but she didn't have the strength, and the current was rapid. She couldn't hold onto the body and was swept by a wave to the center of the river. From then on, Cao E could never return to shore!

### Some Thoughts on the Development of Shanghai's Cultural Undertakings (Part 2)

— Liu Xian

(6) Botanical Garden

Besides a zoo, the establishment of a botanical garden is also essential. The educational, scientific, aesthetic, and economic values of a botanical garden are similar to those of a zoo, but the land area required is much larger. The world-renowned Kew Gardens in London cultivates rare plants from all over the world, some even arranged according to botanical classification systems. It has extremely large greenhouses with tropical temperatures where tropical plants are grown. Other plants, such as alpine and aquatic plants, are cultivated in artificially created environments that mimic their original habitats. I believe Shanghai should also build a large-scale botanical garden like Kew Gardens.

(7) Observatory

An observatory is a symbol of academic development, so the presence of an observatory in a certain place is enough to show that the cultural level of that place is quite high. A place as big as Shanghai does not have a modern observatory. The so-called Xujiahui Observatory is just a weather station. In order to complete the cultural development of Shanghai, it is indispensable to establish a state-of-the-art observatory.

(8) Art Gallery

Although Shanghai constantly holds various art exhibitions, giving art lovers the opportunity to learn from each other, they are nothing more than renting a corner of a shop or borrowing a public place for a few days to do some business. There is no art gallery where exhibits can be permanently displayed for people to view. Foreign friends who come to Shanghai for the first time and want to see Chinese art simply have nowhere to go. In major foreign cities, it is very common to establish an art gallery to display art pieces. It would be strange not to have one. I hope the Shanghai municipal authorities will quickly establish a permanent art gallery, so that foreigners will not find it strange.

(9) Music Hall

In order to accelerate the cultural development of Shanghai, a music hall, a Chinese opera hall, a Western opera hall, and other large buildings related to music are absolutely essential. They can be used for springtime performances, but also for studying music and opera history. The highest institutions of learning are vastly different from cinemas, dance halls, or concerts that focus solely on profit. I hope the municipal government will change the prevailing atmosphere, improve the position of music and song, and start working on this as soon as possible. Let foreigners no longer say that Shanghai has no culture or cultural awareness.

(10) Literary Hall

The establishment of a literary hall has two purposes: one is to provide writers with a central gathering place for holding seminars, lectures, banquets, and other social events; the other is to provide a suitable place for displaying writers' manuscripts, drafts, and memorabilia for public viewing. Literary halls exist in major cities throughout Europe and America. Shanghai, a place with a rich humanistic tradition and a birthplace of writers, is one of the centers of the national cultural movement. It should have established a literary hall long ago to serve as the center of Shanghai's literary arts.

(11) Two Suggestions

In addition to the above ten cultural undertakings that need to be developed as soon as possible, there are two additional suggestions that are also related to cultural undertakings. First, Shanghai has such a dense population, but there are too few parks and recreational spaces, especially in the city center. I suggest that the Hardoon Garden be nationalized and turned into a park for public recreation. Hardoon made a fortune from the rise in Shanghai land prices during his lifetime. Now that he is dead, it is only right to take from Shanghai and give back to Shanghai, to avoid many adopted sons and grandsons fighting over inheritance and going to court. Second, Shanghai has a large population and expensive land, so there are too few sports fields. Even playing tennis requires paying to rent a court, which is greatly related to the health of the national physique. I suggest that the Racecourse be converted into a Shanghai sports field, allowing the general public to continue practicing horseback riding, but prohibiting gambling-related sports equipment, so that citizens can exercise their bodies. The Racecourse is located in the center of the city, making it extremely convenient for citizens from all districts to go there for exercise and recreation, especially providing convenience for students to exercise after class. Both of these things are easy to do, and we eagerly await the implementation by the municipal authorities.

Building Shanghai's cultural undertakings is not a very difficult task, because Shanghai has many superior conditions.

First, Shanghai is China's economic center and financial hub, making it relatively easy to raise funds. Second, Shanghai is a place where talent from all over the country gathers, especially in the cultural field. Talent is the second essential element for cultural development. Third, Shanghai has convenient transportation and is the gateway to domestic and foreign countries, allowing for cultural exchange and catching up with trends, and enabling the rapid completion of material construction. Fourth, Shanghai has a vast urban area, a magnificent scale, beautiful buildings, and well-developed public utilities, making it easy to coordinate once cultural undertakings are built. With these advantages, I dare say that building Shanghai's cultural undertakings is by no means difficult, as long as the municipal authorities fully understand the importance of cultural undertakings, recognize the backwardness of Shanghai's cultural development, broaden their horizons, have a long-term vision, make overall plans, hire experts, formulate plans, quickly raise funds, and implement them in stages. Anything that should be built by the central government should be requested from the central government; anything that should be undertaken by the municipal government should be implemented by the municipal government; anything that can be built automatically by the people can be encouraged for the people to do. In this way, it will be easy to complete quickly.

In short, Shanghai has too much commercial atmosphere and too little cultural development. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been won and construction has begun, we should seize the opportunity, change the atmosphere, and quickly build up cultural undertakings one by one, thereby increasing the city's cultural level and citizens' knowledge, and enhancing Shanghai's position in the international cultural community, so that Shanghai can successfully become a truly modern city. We are all citizens of Shanghai, and we all hope that Shanghai will not only be commercially prosperous, but also a cultural center. [The End]

### Scattered Notes from Prison [1]

— Yao Jun

Prison is My University

"Everything works for good, first of all, because the oracles of God were entrusted to them."

——New Testament "Romans" Chapter 3

Here, I quoted a passage from the Apostle Paul's letter to the Romans. The oracles of God referred to here are the truth. So it can also be said: everything works for good, because it can reveal the truth.

Truth cannot be obtained from fantasy, but must be experienced from real life. In the past, didn't we often feel that the scope of our lives was too narrow and our experiences were not enough? But in normal times, we would not take off our shoes and socks and step out of the small circle of intellectuals to contact the vast lives of the people. Even if we did, it would be very artificial and forced, like amateur actors performing on stage, unable to have a deep understanding. Moreover, we still have to guard against all kinds of malicious suspicions and taboos.

But now, people have thrown me into prison. If I were in my hometown, I could still rely on the assistance of relatives and friends, and with my status, I could obtain many conveniences. But if I did that, I would not be able to have such a deep experience. But instead, I was taken to a strange place thousands of miles away from home. In this strange place, I am unfamiliar with the place and have no relatives to rely on. My loved ones and friends are so far away from me; my position and status are of no use to me. I have been reduced to a lowly position, stripped naked, and forced to live with many different kinds of people, becoming one of them, enduring suffering with them, and enjoying happiness with them.

Here, I am able to experience life more deeply. I am able to observe people's lives from another perspective. I am able to excavate humanity from the deepest places.

In prison, life is the most difficult, but human nature is also the most exposed. Here, there is no need for any falsehood or pretense. Whether you are a murderer or a petty thief, no one can deny that you are a prisoner, and your fellow prisoners will not blame you for your mistakes.

Here, there is no need for any status or position. Everyone is treated the same - this is the most equal place possible. A county magistrate sleeps with a deserter, and a university professor makes friends with a farmer. If you are rich, people may not come to flatter you; if you are poor, no one will look down on you. If you have status, people don't need to curry favor with you; if you are humble, you can still enjoy a share of prison rations. Even if you say you have been wronged and think you cannot be compared to the other prisoners, there are many people here who are even more wronged than you.

Here, if people treat you well, it is because you treat them well; if people treat you badly, it is also because you treat them badly. People respect you because you are humble and upright; people despise you because you are cunning and arrogant. In prison, everyone shares hardships together, so everyone needs each other's help, and often those with status and position have to rely on the help of those they normally look down on.

So, I feel that my time in prison is not wasted, and my suffering is not in vain. In this series of days, I have learned many things that I never dreamed of before. I have a better understanding of the meaning of life, and I have experienced the most difficult and profound life in my life. This is not without benefit to me - a person studying in the field of literature and art. Let me repeat the Apostle Paul's words: "Everything works for good."

If life is a school, then prison should be the highest institution of learning. And I finally have the opportunity to study at this highest institution. Prison is my university. Looking back at human history, how many philosophers, revolutionaries, and writers in the world have been forged here? Fortunately, my imprisonment this time is not because I have committed any fault in this world, but because of a great injustice. Therefore, even though people use venomous tongues to slander me and set traps to frame me, they cannot put any dishonorable charges on my body and shame me. On the contrary, I am honest and at ease. I can only comfort myself with this, and use it to comfort my loved ones and all my caring relatives and friends.

Ode to Friendship

What I feel most deeply about this time in prison is the great friendship between human beings.

When we were like defenseless lambs, roped and led to the land of death, my heart trembled, my lips were dry, my limbs were sore and weak, the terrifying ropes bound me, the net of death shrouded me, and an unknowable fate was waiting for me ahead.

When we arrived at a place, I discovered that there were also people inside, people with humanity just like me. They gave us preferential treatment and convenience, and shared our sorrows and joys. Not only did relatives and friends give me enthusiastic concern, fellow prisoners gave me tangible help, and even those in charge of guarding did not stint their warmth and gave me abundant sympathy.

In this series of difficult days, I have lived in the friendship of people. This great friendship has kept me from falling into despair and has given me great comfort. No matter what situation I am in, people have given me sympathy and help. When I am sad, people comfort me; when I am sick and lying down, people support me; even when I am taken to a strange place thousands of miles away from home, I am still filled with people's friendship. Many people I have never met before take off their inner and outer garments to cover me, share their food to feed me, and in these small things are pregnant with the great love of humanity that my little heart cannot bear.

The great friendship of humanity that I have received in this suffering is beyond my ability to describe with pen and ink, nor can this small space contain it. I don't want to go into detail here, because the sympathy and help that people have given me is purely out of a righteous act and does not expect any return. I do not want to express my gratitude here in empty words, lest I profane this divine friendship.

In these days, I have not shed tears because of my own unfortunate experience, but because of the tangible friendship of people, I have repeatedly been unable to hold back the tears welling up in my eyes.

"Wherever there are people, there is friendship." This is a sentence that I experienced in prison. When I was about to leave my hometown on the eve of being taken away, when I said goodbye to two friends in need, I once told them to tell my loved ones and all my caring relatives and friends, and I also used this sentence to embolden myself. It is based on this belief that even though I am thousands of miles away from home, lonely and helpless, I have not been invaded by pain and sorrow. The further I am from home, the more I feel the preciousness of human friendship. At the same time, I also deeply feel that there is still justice and truth between human beings. They are the two daughters of the god of truth.

In prison, I saw those upright people! They are not great figures, but they have great grievances. Although their clothes are tattered and their bodies are covered with sores, they are respected by people.

Under the sun, I also saw those who do evil and succeed. Although they have power and money, they are still despised by people, and even their parents and children are ashamed of their names.

Therefore, I can say: "Wherever there are people, there is friendship, justice, and truth."

These things are only shown to those who have been humbled and suffered. Because those who live in freedom do not feel the importance of sunlight and air; similarly, those who live comfortably and are proud of heart do not feel the preciousness of sympathy.

Only those who are lonely and helpless can appreciate the preciousness of friendship; only those who have been harmed can appreciate the value of justice and truth, which are more precious than life.

Therefore, I understand why beggars can beg from door to door and enjoy themselves; and I understand why vagrants can make their homes everywhere and have smiles on their faces.

Therefore, I also understand why those who are persecuted for justice can calmly sacrifice themselves; and I understand why Jesus Christ was willing to sacrifice himself for the world and be nailed to the cross.

I remember the psalm of David, King of Israel: "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside quiet waters. He restores my soul; he guides me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me. You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. Surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever."

I am willing to gird up my loins, put on my sandals, take up my staff, and travel to the ends of the earth, to go to every place where there are people, to experience the great friendship of humanity, to pursue truth and justice.

### Further Discussion on Foreign Films in Shanghai

— Gu Zhongyi

My previous article on foreign films in *Chunqiu* has attracted a lot of attention from all sides. Friends who have seen it have come to inquire, and I myself feel that I have not said enough and must add to it.

We acknowledge that film is the most powerful tool for social education. If the Allied nations bring films with educational value to China for business, we should welcome them wholeheartedly. If they make money from us as a result, we will not be stingy. However, we have two requirements for film distributors:

(1) Knowing that China needs widespread knowledge and primary education after the war, we ask that film distributors specifically transport films related to education. American film distributors should automatically refrain from transporting films that are frivolous or toxic to the Chinese people (which may not have a bad influence in the United States, where the level of education is high), such as films about murder, modern theft, the dissolute lives of men and women, and excessive drinking and dancing.

(2) Film distributors' revenue splits are too high. For color films, they often go as high as 60%, while theaters only get 40%. Therefore, theaters have no choice but to repeatedly raise ticket prices, barring ordinary poor viewers from the door. Film distributors' revenue splits are breaking world records. In the United States, they can only take a maximum of 30%, and anything above that is illegal. However, they are acting lawlessly in China, arbitrarily raising the revenue split percentage. Chinese film merchants have no other films to show, so they have no choice but to endure being bullied. Foreign film distributors also know that the Chinese government will not protect Chinese film merchants, so they are even more unscrupulous and arbitrarily set prices. Therefore, I hope that American film distributors will reduce the revenue split percentage on their own initiative in the spirit of Allied friendship and assistance.

At the same time, I hope that those in power in the central government will understand that the film industry is not a commercial industry but a cultural industry. Of course, we acknowledge that many Chinese film merchants do not understand that film is a cultural industry, but only know how to make money to fill their own pockets. We should overthrow these merchants. The government should do its best to support this cultural industry. The methods of support are as follows:

(1) Assist cultural figures in establishing privately-owned film studios. Return confiscated property as soon as possible, lend large sums of capital to those with insufficient capital, send film talent abroad to study, and donate public land to film studios as a base... In short, make private film studios start working immediately in the shortest possible time.

(2) Reduce entertainment taxes and at the same time require theaters to reduce ticket prices to make them more accessible. I have always insisted that the most reasonable entertainment tax is: 10% for plays and 20% for films. A wise government that wants the majority of people to have the opportunity to see films will definitely consider this issue.

(3) Use diplomatic means to negotiate sternly with foreign film distributors: prohibit the import of frivolous or toxic films, and order film distributors to reduce the revenue split to a maximum of 30%. Americans are the most reasonable people. As long as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sends someone to negotiate, I believe they will agree immediately.

(4) Reward Chinese films with educational value, either with funds or with tax exemptions. Then everyone will definitely compete to make new films.

As long as the above points are achieved, the film cultural industry can be brought into line and thrive.

### Double Flying Together (15)

— Zhao Qingge

If there were a few days when the business of Huichuntang wasn't good, the old woman would pout and grumble, "Strange, why hasn't anyone gotten sick these past few days?" Whenever he heard these words, Liao Lao immediately stopped her, saying, "You can't talk like that. We opened this pharmacy to save people. It's good if no one is sick. We shouldn't just hope for people to get sick for the sake of making money. You have to know that our kind of business is different from other kinds. Our kind of business is close to charity." But the old woman would never think like that. She only knew that doing business was for making money, regardless of what kind of business it was. The purpose was always the same. The one who sells cloth, naturally hopes that people's clothes are often torn so that he has business. The one who sells furniture, naturally hopes that people's furniture often breaks so that he has business. The one who sells coffins, naturally hopes that many people die so that he has business. Similarly, the one who sells medicinal herbs, naturally also hopes that people are constantly sick so that he has business. There is no righteousness in business. If you want to make money, you can't have a conscience! Otherwise, don't do business, don't think about making money. This is a fact, and Liao Lao admitted the old woman's reasoning, but he couldn't bear to think that way! He told the old woman, "My original intention in doing the medicinal herb business was to save people! I would rather make less money than wish for people to be sick." Because of this issue, the two of them argued constantly, but neither could convince the other!

The business of Huichuntang truly encountered misfortune! Two months ago, two foreign doctors emerged from who-knows-what clouds; and then batches of foreign medicine were shipped to the Jinglv Inn. Before long, even a foreign pharmacy opened in the city. The two foreign doctors themselves attached an internal and surgical clinic to this foreign pharmacy. Everyone who went to consult with them neither had their pulse taken; nor did they have to pay a prescription fee; the medicine cured their illnesses, and the medicine was also cheap. So, in everyone's hearts, the two foreign doctors became reincarnations of Hua Tuo; the foreign pharmacy became a miraculous and effective temple. Thus, the fame of the foreign doctors spread throughout Jingzhou; the business of the foreign pharmacy was extremely prosperous. Although a few conservatives were not seduced by the foreign doctors, they were ultimately in the minority. The majority of the common people welcomed the generosity of the foreign doctors. Therefore, the traditional Chinese doctors of Jingzhou frowned, and the traditional Chinese medical profession of Jingzhou lost business! Huichuntang was no exception. For two months, almost no one patronized it. Occasionally, a few doses of herbal medicine were still requested, but pills and powders were simply ignored.

Liao Lao became very anxious! He could accept having no business because he hoped people were healthy, but he was unwilling to close his doors because of the invasion of foreign doctors and foreign medicines. Standing from the position of a traditional Chinese doctor, he felt that Chinese people should not be superstitious about foreign doctors. The treatment methods of foreign doctors were simply Mongolian treatment methods. He had seen a doctor use a pair of scissors to forcibly cut the festering sore into a hole, and then stuff it with some cotton, and that was it. He had also seen a person suffering from tuberculosis. The foreign internal medicine doctor tapped on the person's chest with his fingers for a while, and then took a five-inch-long glass tube needle and stuck it into the patient's wrist vein. All of this horrified Liao Lao, who had some medical knowledge! He thought that this was not treating illness at all, but clearly adding fuel to the fire, making people suffer "foreign" torment! He told everyone how ignorant and barbaric and dangerous foreign doctors were, but on the one hand, he repeatedly stated: he was not worried about his own business, but was worried about ignorant patients being deceived!

### Memory

— Fei Cun

I linger over reviewing the ruins behind me

Parting the overgrown weeds and thorny bushes of years

Seeking a smile left behind by an old friend

Or the tear stains of childhood mourning a small cat

Even if memory is a pile of broken glass

Cutting my heart

But that dripping blood

Nourishes my about-to-dry-up life
