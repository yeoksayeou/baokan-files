\[Our newspaper's Beiping dispatch dated 28th] According to reports received by relevant agencies, the Northeast Communist troops are actively transporting troops to Yantai by water to reinforce it. The industrial machinery acquired by the Communists in Shandong, along with Yantai's own industrial capabilities, will enable them to defend the city to the greatest extent possible. The Communists are currently using motorboats and sailboats to transport troops to Yantai by sea. There are currently two motorboats in use, each capable of towing twenty sailboats. Each sailboat can carry 300 people, and the motorboat itself can carry 1,000 people, enabling the transport of 6,000 to 7,000 troops at a time.

Japanese Present Exquisite Gifts, Including a Gold-Inlaid Box Depicting Pine Trees, Delivered to Shanghai Yesterday by Zhu Shiming

Those welcoming him at the scene included Zou Renzhi, Director of the War Criminals Management Office of the Ministry of National Defense, Yao Gengsheng, Director of the Mission's Shanghai Office, and many others. After returning to his residence by special car, Mr. Zhu met with reporters and spoke freely about Japan after the war. Mr. Zhu first stated that after the war, Japan was under Allied control, and social order was quite stable, and industry and commerce gradually recovered. Foreign trade had to be negotiated through the Foreign Trade Group of the Allied Headquarters and the Japanese Trade Agency, which took a long time. Regarding the situation of our compatriots in Japan, Mr. Zhu stated that our compatriots in Japan were living in good conditions. However, due to the long war between China and Japan, resentment among the compatriots and conflicts with the Japanese were aroused. The Shibuya incident was one example. The case is currently being tried by a specially formed court. The judges of this court consist of two Americans and one Chinese. The Chinese military judge participating is Qiu Shaohang. It is believed that a fair judgment will be obtained after a legal trial. It is understood that Mr. Zhu is scheduled to fly to the capital from Shanghai on the morning of the 29th to report on his duties and will return to Shanghai in a few days to hold a tea party to invite reporters from various newspapers to report on the situation of controlling Japan.

Furthermore, the Japanese people specially presented many valuable birthday gifts in honor of Chairman Chiang's sixtieth birthday and asked Director Zhu to bring them to the capital for presentation. However, Director Zhu followed Chairman's instructions and only accepted two items: one was a gold screen with a painting of pine trees and eagles by Kawai Gyokudo, and the other was a "gold-inlaid writing box." The gold screen could not be carried this time and will be transported later. The latter is a wooden square box six inches high, eight inches long, and six and a half inches wide, with a black, diffused, gold-inlaid surface depicting pine trees, exquisite and beautiful, surrounded by green silk and encased in a wooden box. Attached is a note written on xuan paper: "To His Excellency Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the National Government of the Republic of China, from Saito Tadashi, representative of the New Japan Allied China Club, and Tsukada Nobuo, representative of former Japanese residents in China." There was also a "lacquered hand box with orchids" presented by all the overseas Chinese in Japan, of the same size and style as the one presented by the Japanese, with a surface entirely inlaid with scattered gold and decorated with chrysanthemums. Inside was a set of dishes with fan-shaped inlays and plum blossoms, exquisite and beautiful, and extremely valuable.

Enemy Military Police to be Sent Back: Identify Your Tormentors – A Final Chance!
　　The Shanghai Anti-Japanese War Martyrs Association previously gathered over ninety members on September 18th at the Jiangwan prisoner of war camp to identify enemy military police. Twenty-six brutal officers were identified on the spot, but due to deception and cover-ups, the majority of those who should have been identified escaped. It is reported that the Association has received notice from the War Criminals Management Office of the Ministry of National Defense that all enemy military police in China will be sent back to their country in the near future. Therefore, to accommodate members who were unable to participate in the previous identification, the Association has arranged for members to gather at the Association's office (557 Hart Road) before 9:00 AM on October 30th. A large number of vehicles have been borrowed from various agencies for transportation, and all members are welcome to register and join. The identification method will be the same as before: all Japanese military police will be lined up, and members will inspect them one by one. If any are identified, they will be immediately detained for legal proceedings. Once all the brutal officers have been sent back to their country, it will be much more difficult to report them. Therefore, this identification can be considered the last opportunity. Members are encouraged to participate actively.

Preventing Blindness: Establishment of Anti-Blindness Committee; First Preparatory Meeting Held Yesterday Afternoon
　　[Our Newspaper] To promote the prevention of blindness in Shanghai, the China Blind Welfare Association, in conjunction with the Bureau of Health, and with the invitation of experts and socially concerned individuals, is jointly establishing the "Shanghai Anti-Blindness Committee." The first preparatory meeting was held yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM in the conference room of the Bureau of Health. Attendees included Director of the Bureau of Health Zhang Wei, Director of the Anti-Tuberculosis Department Chen Bangxian, Secretary-General of the China Blind Welfare Association Jiang Boqi, Lu Chenglong from the YMCA, and limited-subject experts Zhou Chenhu, Hou Xuemin, Zhang Fuxing (represented by Zhai Xiangqian), and others. Chairman Zhang Wei gave a speech, stating that the majority of blindness can be prevented, but due to the low level of knowledge among Chinese people and the lack of medical knowledge, trachoma and blindness are particularly prevalent. Seeing the lack of importance placed on eye diseases in Chinese society, we should pay special attention to this work. Prevention lies in seizing the time and not waiting until the disease develops before seeking treatment. The purpose of the Anti-Blindness Committee is also to achieve this. It was immediately resolved that the name of the committee would be the "Shanghai Anti-Blindness Committee of the China Blind Welfare Association," inviting the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, the Bureau of Education, and other relevant agencies to participate. The committee will consist of 15 to 21 members, with 5 to 7 standing committee members. Their duties are: (A) Matters related to the prevention and treatment of eye diseases that cause blindness. (B) Planning the source of funds and medicine. (C) Matters related to research on the prevention of blindness. Zhou Chenhu, Jiang Boqi, Chen Bangxian, Hou Xuemin, and Zhang Fuxing were appointed as preparatory committee members to discuss detailed steps.
De Fuyo Trading Company's Dye Inventory: Still Available for Six Months; Government to Form New Agency to Handle Future Supply
　　[Our Newspaper] Among the German assets being liquidated by the German Assets Liquidation Office, the inventory of De Fuyo Trading Company is the largest. The dyes already sold amount to approximately 15 to 16 billion, and the current inventory is also worth approximately 15 to 16 billion. The machine dyes allocated by the office are mainly for factories that are members of the municipal machine dyeing industry association. Other factories with actual needs may also apply for allocation. Hand dyes will be sold by auction to dye shops in the city. Prices will be adjusted based on market prices, with allocation prices and auction floors being 10-20% cheaper than market prices. The office holds auctions once or twice a week, and the current inventory is expected to last for six months. The government may establish a new agency to replace De Fuyo Trading Company in the future regarding the supply of dyes. The office's responsibility is only to liquidate the assets of De Fuyo Trading Company. According to insiders, De Fuyo Trading Company monopolized the dye market in China in the past, and dyes are closely related to industry and commerce. The government should establish a new agency to supply dyes.

Tenants of Enemy and Puppet Houses Urge Continued Tenancy Rights
　　The Municipal Council, in view of the severe housing shortage in the city and to prevent landlords from taking back houses under false pretenses, resolved that "when a fixed-term lease expires, the original tenant has the right to continue the lease." The resolution has been sent to the Municipal Government to be communicated to the entire city and to be forwarded to the Legislative Yuan for consideration when revising the Housing Lease Regulations. Recently, legal tenants renting enemy and puppet houses in the city, considering that although the property rights belong to the enemy and puppet regimes, the tenancy rights are the same as ordinary leases in law, will request the Municipal Council to supplement the aforementioned resolution with "the preceding provision also applies to those who legally rent enemy and puppet houses" to clarify and prevent disputes. It is reported that there are thousands of such tenants in the city, and they fear that the upcoming auction of all enemy and puppet houses by the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau will cause disputes, hence the request.
Songdan Ship to Arrive This Afternoon; China Union Ship to Ningbo Unnecessary

Regarding the report yesterday that the ship would sail to Ningbo with people celebrating Chairman Chiang's birthday, General Manager Zhou Caoyi told reporters that the Fellow Association had requested the Hualian ship to sail to Ningbo, but now that Chairman Chiang has returned to Nanjing, it is no longer necessary for celebrants to go to Fenghua, so the Hualian ship will not need to sail to Ningbo. It is also learned that the company has arranged for connecting transportation between Xingang Tanggu and Dagu to facilitate passengers, with cars traveling between Xingang Tanggu and Tianjin.

Municipal Council Approves in Principle the Reclamation of the Water Company; Convenor of Sub-Committee Holds First Joint Meeting Yesterday
　　[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Council held its first joint meeting of various committee convenors at the Council's headquarters at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, presided over by Speaker Pan Gongzhan. Deputy Speaker Xu Qiqing and committee convenors Tang Shichang, Wang Zhuyi, He Yuanming, Zhu Fojiu, and 26 others attended to discuss (1) the reclamation of the British-owned Shanghai Waterworks Company, (2) the authority of various committees, and (3) the inspection of municipal facilities by councilors. Deputy Minister Peng Zhaoxian of the Ministry of Interior, accompanied by Liu Xuehai, Special Commissioner for the Suppression of Opium in the Shanghai Area, and Shi Zhongxiu, Secretary of the Ministry of Interior, attended at 4:45 PM, accompanied by Zhang Xiaosong, Director of the Civil Affairs Department. Peng expressed his views on the authority of the various committees of the Municipal Council, stating that many central laws and regulations are adopted from those implemented in Europe and the United States, but in reality, China may not be able to do them well. At the same time, the complexity of jurisdictional relations affects work efficiency. He hopes that the councilors of this city will provide more suggestions for improvement and assist in the work of suppressing drugs. Peng left immediately after his speech. He plans to attend the meeting of the Autonomous Region Committee again today.
　　During the meeting, Secretary-General Xiang Changquan first gave a brief report on the resolutions of the various committees after the adjournment of the General Assembly, and then began to discuss the motion.
　　(1) Approve the letter from the Municipal Government, stating that the exclusive operating contract of the British-owned Shanghai Waterworks Company will expire on July 1, 1947. It is difficult to recover funds for reconstruction due to the urgent need for funds, and it is proposed to extend the term for ten years and revise the contract to maintain sovereignty. In addition to reporting to the Executive Yuan for approval, please discuss and reply as soon as possible. Councilors expressed their opinions enthusiastically. Councilor Fei Shusheng, representing the opinions of some councilors at the previous symposium, reported to the joint meeting, saying that foreign-owned companies should be reclaimed, and it would be unwise not to reclaim the British Waterworks Company when there is an opportunity to do so. After discussion, five points were tentatively proposed for reference: (1) The original government shares of the company can be taken over by the Municipal Government. (2) The central government should participate in some government shares. (3) Open up some equity to encourage merchant investment. (4) If the above methods are not easy to implement, the Municipal Government can issue public bonds. (5) Foreign capital can continue to be retained, but it should not exceed 49%. Foreigners can still be hired for management and technical aspects.
　　Councilor Lu Shidao also expressed that it should be reclaimed. It is estimated that the capital of the waterworks company is about 13 billion yuan. In addition to some Chinese shares, the remaining amount is not too large. If the central government can allocate and sell the Broadway Building, the estimated value is 12 billion yuan. Moreover, with two years of preparation, a solution can be found.
　　Councilor Ma Junshuo explained, based on the rights in the contract and the rights of the state, that the Shanghai Municipal Government has the exclusive right to public utilities in the city and the right to dispose of them freely, and is absolutely not bound by the previous period of the Municipal Council and the waterworks company, so it can be reclaimed at any time, and it can be reclaimed and operated by itself when it expires.
　　As a result, the speaker put forward his opinion, which was unanimously approved: (1) In accordance with the principle of Article 2 of Resolution No. 5 of the first session of the first meeting of the Council, the Shanghai Waterworks Company of British Business shall be reclaimed immediately upon expiration, and the implementation measures shall be drafted by the Public Utilities Committee of the Council. (2) The opinion of the Council shall be sent to the Municipal Government and telegraphed to the Executive Yuan. The draft shall be revised by the heads of the Regulations Group, Wu Zhengxi, Zhu Fojiu and Ma Junshuo. In addition, the Municipal Council is still soliciting individual opinions from councilors for the reference of the Public Utilities Group.
　　(2) According to Article 3, paragraph 4 of the rules of procedure for the various committees of the Council, the authority of the Council is to study or review relevant motions, and there is no right to make a decisive delivery of implementation. During the recess, if emergency cases occur, the exercise of the authority of the Council is often inconvenient to convene, and it is difficult to convene a temporary General Assembly. Please discuss how to remedy the situation. Decision: In cases where the General Assembly has adopted the principle, the implementation measures and relevant rules and regulations may be resolved and implemented after review by the various committees.
　　(3) In order to enable the councilors of the Council to thoroughly understand the actual situation of municipal facilities in the city, so as to propose suggestions for improvement, it is stipulated that the councilors shall conduct on-site inspections and draft an outline. Please make a public decision on the resolution: (1) It is not necessary to limit the inspection date, and the content of the outline can be changed to matters needing attention, and the Council shall send a letter to the councilors to pay attention to them regularly. (2) The matters needing attention shall be sent to the Municipal Government and forwarded to the relevant departments for compliance. Later, there was also a temporary motion that all resolutions of the various committees must be sent to the competent authority through the official letter of the Council before they can take effect. Please call for attention to the resolution and approve it. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM.

Severe Disaster Situation in Anhui Province: Appeal for Donations for Relief
　　The Anhui Disaster Relief Association held a tea party for reporters at Xingzhong Academy yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. Secretary-General Wang Jiyi reported on the disaster situation in Anhui Province, stating: (1) War disaster: In the twelve counties in northeastern Anhui, which have been occupied by the Communist army for seven or eight years, nine out of ten houses are empty, and the houses are in ruins. The number of victims is about 4 million, and farm implements and cattle have also been taken away. Without plowing in autumn and winter, there will be a famine in the wheat season next year. (2) Flood disaster: Since the Yellow River breached its banks in Zhongmu in 1938, nineteen counties and cities have been flooded. This year, due to the Communist army's invasion of Zhongmu, the breach could not be closed, and the flood is even greater than in previous years. It is estimated that over 4 million acres of farmland have been affected, with a loss of about 6 million piculs of grain, over 60,000 houses lost, and over 5 million refugees. (3) Locust plague: Almost every county affected by floods and hill disasters has also suffered from locust plagues. About 10 million refugees are in urgent need of relief. The association has launched a fundraising team. Fellow Anhui people in Shanghai have automatically donated 15.5 million yuan. In addition, the association has invited the soccer king Li Huitang to hold a soccer charity match in Shanghai and invited famous opera singers to perform Peking opera to raise relief funds. The fundraising target is tentatively set at 500 million yuan.

A public notice was published in the newspaper on September 28 of this year, setting a deadline of two months for return. It is now learned that the above deadline will expire on November 30. After that, there will be no further extension. The refund of remittances sent from the above units to various places has also been verified separately.

The return procedures are recorded as follows:
　　Return Procedures
　　(1) The units for returning remittance refunds are the Shanghai Branch, Suzhou Branch, and the eight offices of South Shanghai, West Shanghai, Kunshan, Taicang, Songjiang, Changshu, Wuxi, and Nantong of the Puppet Central Reserve Bank.

All verified refund remittances can be returned.

(4) If the original remitter is far away in another place and it is inconvenient to apply in Shanghai, they may issue a power of attorney to entrust a business or individual in Shanghai to apply on their behalf. If there is no power of attorney, they can directly contact the office by letter for handling. (5) For the sake of prudence, in addition to the application procedures, each applicant for the refund of remittances should also prepare a guarantee, which should be filled out by the original applicant and sent to the office, but if the original remittance receipt or draft is complete and there are no other questions, the guarantee may be waived.

Inducing Friend's Wife and Instigating Husband's Murder: Conspiracy Fails, Enters Prison
　　[Our Newspaper] Yang Rongquan, 23 years old, from Yuyao, who lives at No. 131, Xiaoxingli, Bansongyuan Road, is a road foreman in the Railway Bureau. He married Zheng Xiuhua, a Cantonese woman of the same age, a few years ago. Zheng is beautiful and has received secondary education. Yang has a friend named Wei Shougui, nicknamed "Xiao Shazi," also known as "Beiping." During the enemy and puppet period, he was the puppet chief. He often came to Yang's place, so he was very familiar with Zheng.
　　On the afternoon of the 16th of this month, Zheng sent gifts to her mother's house. On the way, she passed the Baxianqiao on Kaisarerni Road. After greeting Chen Ailan (16 years old), a girl Wei knew, Wei asked Zheng to go to the Huguang Theater to see a movie after sending the gift. Then Zheng went to the theater and saw Wei waiting alone at the side of the door. After the end of the play, Wei tricked Zheng to go to the Laoguangdong Cantonese Restaurant at the intersection of Xizilaihuo Street on Zhongzheng Road for dinner. He repeatedly persuaded Zheng to drink fine wine and got her drunk. He hired a car to the Guotai Hotel on Yunnan South Road, opened Room 304, and took advantage of her drunkenness to rape Zheng. Zheng returned the next morning. On the 20th, Wei again asked Zheng to go to the Empire Theater to watch a Shanghai opera. After the end of the show, they were walking arm in arm when they suddenly encountered Yang's friend, Kan Honggui, near the Nanyang Bridge. Wei feared that the matter would be revealed and insisted on inviting Kan to a photo studio, where the three took a group photo. After going out, he threatened Honggui not to spread the word, or he would kill him. The next morning, Wei went to Yang's house again. Zheng happened to be washing clothes in the kitchen. He gave her a packet of black medicine powder and ordered her to mix it in Yang's coffee to poison him. But after several days there was no news. On the 25th, he asked Chen Xiulan to inquire about the situation. He learned that Zheng had thrown the black medicine powder into the mud ditch. At the same time, Yang also learned the truth from Honggui. Kan and Chen Ailan were willing to testify. Yang reported to the Penglai Police Station at 3:30 PM yesterday. Director Yao immediately ordered Section Chief Yao and staff Sun Hao to lead plainclothes police Wang Xiaoyun, Wang Yimin, and Yang Jinxin to arrest Wei. Zheng Xiuhua and witnesses were summoned for interrogation. He was handed over to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation on charges of inducing rape and attempted murder.

China's Emerging Special Forces: Paratrooper Warriors in Growth

Twenty-Fourth Day, Suzhou Dispatch - Our Suzhou Correspondent, Wu Shouren - Paratroopers, in China's national defense history, are still considered an emerging term; it originated at the end of December in the thirty-second year of the Republic [1943], in Kunming, the rear area, where the first paratrooper regiment appeared. It has only been three years and ten months since then, and it is growing vigorously every day. The general public has a mysterious conjecture and yearning for this group of warriors who descend from the sky! It cannot be said that it is a coincidence that this emerging special force has come to the Beijing-Shanghai line; the headquarters of the paratrooper general team has even gracefully moved to Suzhou. Suzhou, with its clear mountains and beautiful waters, has a great reputation in history; the arrival of paratrooper warriors is like a beauty meeting a hero; in every corner of Suzhou society, which is known for its literary style, it has aroused excited attention and grand welcome! Everyone wants to delve into this peculiar group to break the mysterious conjecture and yearning; but for two months, people's hopes have not been satisfied. However, this reporter was fortunate enough to be invited by Major General Ma Shigong, commander of the general team, to be the first to break into the interior of this group. Rather than excavating secrets, it is more appropriate and appropriate to say that it is excavating treasures! Before making a detailed report to the readers, this reporter dares to make such a conclusion: paratrooper training is indeed a valuable treasure in the requirements of China's national defense modernization!

October 22nd was an autumn season with a high sky and refreshing air, a quiet and clear sky; at 4 pm, the reporter stepped into the commander's office as agreed. Before the visit, Commander Ma gave a detailed explanation of the history, education, training, and living conditions of the paratrooper unit to enable the reporter to obtain a true reference with the field observation. The reporter would like to express his gratitude here for Mr. Ma's enthusiastic feelings!

The existence of paratroopers in China is required by facts and urged by the trend; at the beginning of the Second World War, Germany used the force of a paratrooper army in Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Crete, etc., to help extend the devil's hand of Nazi aggression and achieved results, which shocked military scientists all over the world; it opened a new era in war history. Since then, the Allied countries such as the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union immediately implemented plans to establish and enrich airborne troops, and strived for perfection; they finally harvested the great effect of blocking traffic, containing reinforcements, and cutting off the rear in the landing operations on the southwestern Pacific islands and the counter-offensive against Germany in the Normandy landing. In December of the 32nd year of the Republic [1943], when northern Myanmar was recovered and China won a great military victory, the War of Resistance entered a new stage; the government, in view of the expected counter-offensive, and the smooth advancement of the counter-offensive, all needed airborne troops to be able to exert their power behind the enemy as they pleased! Therefore, General Du Yuming, who had not been back from the expedition for a long time, was specially ordered to plan and organize the paratroopers. On New Year's Day of the following year, this was an epoch-making day in the history of China's national defense; the prototype of the airborne troops, the first paratrooper regiment, was officially established in Gangtou Village, a northern suburb of Kunming, Yunnan.

The first paratrooper warriors were entirely young men from Hunan and Guangxi provinces who had received junior high school education; under the command of Major General Li Hanping, the regiment leader, they became the basis for China's true paratroopers. In April, the organization was expanded, new forces were added, and it was reorganized into the Army Assault General Team; many American instructors were hired to begin lightning-style true paratrooper training. In addition to the headquarters, the organization also had a replenishment brigade and various subordinate units, with a total of four battalions, twenty teams, and one hundred and fourteen platoons; cadres at all levels included all provinces except Tibet, with Shaanxi, Sichuan, Henan, and Guangdong being the most numerous. Major General Ma Shigong was ordered to be the commander of the general team in August of the 34th year [1945]. This March, he was ordered to be subordinate to the Air Force and renamed the Paratrooper General Team.

Due to the innate operational environment, paratroopers often have to survive only under conditions of certainty of victory; therefore, its education has its subjective characteristics, which is to cultivate the officers and soldiers' strong fighting will and the spirit of either success or death. This is also the focus of the admiration of the broad masses of society for the greatness of the paratrooper warriors! Commander Ma has indelible achievements in completing this educational work; for example, he has clear rewards and punishments for cadres and soldiers at all levels, and a kind attitude; except for working hours, they get along with each other like family members, and express their true feelings to each other without any likes or dislikes; these are phenomena that are not often seen in ordinary general troops. This kind of sincere and loving group life, coupled with multi-faceted education, can easily cultivate loyalty, courage, enthusiasm, and the ambition to sacrifice oneself, and reap the great effect of the heroic spirit that puts life and death aside being strong and active.

### The Pride of the Military Branch

However, to become a sound paratrooper, it is not enough to have a spirit of selfless sacrifice; he must also have a physique as strong as an ox, as well as firm nerves and a solid heart. Only in this way can he jump from a height of ten thousand feet with a heavy load without being dizzy or bewildered by the shock of the wind! Therefore, paratrooper officers and soldiers have exceptionally strict enlistment conditions; in terms of age: captains and below must not exceed 25 years old, lieutenant colonels and majors must not exceed 32 years old; soldiers must be over 18 years old and under 25 years old. In terms of physique: regarding weight and height, all officers and soldiers must be 48 kilograms and 165 centimeters or more; and without any hidden diseases. Others require soldiers to have a lung capacity of more than 30 cuo [a traditional measure], a breathing difference of more than 5 centimeters, and a single-handed grip strength of more than 20 kilograms. In terms of academic qualifications: officers above the rank of captain must have graduated from military school, while lieutenants and below must have graduated from the cadre training class of a division or the cadre political team in various places; soldiers generally must have a junior high school education or above. Moreover, after enlisting, they must also undergo a year and a half of training, which includes seven processes: (1) spiritual training, (2) fitness training, (3) weapons training, (4) combat training, (5) special training, (6) parachute training, (7) parachute folding training; only after completing these seven stages of training can one be considered a true paratrooper!

A true paratrooper is the pride of any military branch; he can soar in the sky like a bird; supernaturally overlook the earth, with high mountains like mounds, jungles like thin grass, and wide lakes like bright mirrors. Who can enjoy such a clear overview? As for the deeds of "flying generals descending from the sky" in legendary novels, realistically displayed in modern society, it is especially a proud magical skill! The state also gives special treatment to this group of outstanding warriors: in terms of supplies, each person receives 27 liang [a traditional unit of weight] of rice per day, and a monthly food allowance of 30,000 yuan; the salary is higher than that of ordinary army soldiers, officers are twice as high, sergeants are twice as high, and privates are three times as high; this is still the standard before the adjustment in September. In daily life, in addition to the work and rest schedule set according to the season, there is also normal adjustment in terms of entertainment; they have a film projection team and a drama troupe, showing two films every week, and performing dramas on Saturdays; a party is also held once a month, with "party" music, singing, acrobatics, drama and other programs; the only principle is to sing and play by themselves, without hiring dancing girls or singers, and without hiring professional performers from outside. Recently, in order to celebrate the chairman's sixtieth birthday, Colonel Zhang Tianyi, the chief instructor, is preparing an unprecedented grand party, scheduled to be held on October 31; with Commander Ma's kindness, he repeatedly urged the reporter to attend this grand event as scheduled. The reporter yearns for the warm scene on this day, and the sincere carnival celebration of officers and soldiers regardless of rank, and cannot help but stir up endless yearning!

### Barracks Tour

The sun gradually sank below the horizon, and brilliant evening clouds rose in the western sky; against the background of the beautiful autumn dusk, the reporter took a photo with Commander Ma and Chief Instructor Zhang, and then began the barracks tour. The barracks of the paratrooper general team headquarters in Suzhou cover a total area of 50 mu [a traditional unit of area]; the cavalry unit and the army military prison reside there, and the paratrooper garrison area is only a corner. Inside, there are wide lawns, flat training grounds, lush trees, and tidy buildings. Commander Ma accompanied the visit and briefly talked about the paratrooper's battle achievements; in July of the 34th year [1945], at that time, it was only one year and three months since the beginning of true paratrooper skills training; a part of this group of warriors was ordered to land in Kaiping, Guangdong, to destroy the enemy's water and land transportation behind the enemy in the Jiangxi area; and to capture Nankou, Nanyao, Nandu and other enemy water and land central stations, and the first test of their skills showed their talents. Afterwards, they landed near Honglu District in Hengyang, cutting off the Hengbao Highway and threatening the enemy's rear; and airlifted Liuzhou, occupied Danzhu Airport, making the enemy look down on them and showing supreme power! With China's newly emerging paratroopers, being able to leave such a glorious page in the history of the War of Resistance, the reporter cannot help but pay his sincere respect to this group of heavenly soldiers and generals from the bottom of his heart!

Walking and talking, we walked through a long corridor, and the rooms on both sides were the soldiers' dormitories; although the reporter glanced quickly, the impression of neatness and cleanliness was deeply imprinted in his mind. One point that must be specially mentioned is that every room and every bed has more or less books; this can prove that the education level of paratroopers is indeed quite high! The reporter experienced that the Chinese soldiers are eliminating the accumulated habits of rudeness and entering a new life; this new life undoubtedly symbolizes the bright and powerful future of China!

In the twilight, the reporter walked out of the gate of the paratrooper general team headquarters, which was covered with pine and cypress arches; walking on the road paved with fine sand, his mind was still lingering with a face; the handsome face, matched with thick eyebrows and dark eyes, fully showed his shrewdness and ability. The moderate height and the elegant temperament are completely the demeanor of a Confucian general; this is a sketch of Major General Ma Shigong, the commander of the general team! Mr. Ma is 44 years old this year, from Suide, Shaanxi, a graduate of the first class of Whampoa Military Academy and the sixth special class of the Army University; he joined the army early and participated in dozens of battles, large and small, such as the East Expedition, the Northern Expedition, Kunlun Pass, and Myanmar. He once served as General Du Yuming's chief of staff, and he was extremely frugal and had no hobbies. He deserves to be called a progressive soldier!

"Paratroopers are mobile strategic troops and strategic units; in future wars, infantry must be airlifted, otherwise infantry will inevitably lose its effectiveness in national defense; therefore, to build a modern army, we must first build a strong air force and expand a sufficient number of paratroopers! Our paratroopers are still in their infancy, and we are now preparing to develop vigorously. We hope that the spiritual education and fitness education of paratroopers can be popularized among the people; this is a great way for China to continuously strengthen itself!" The reporter silently blessed, wishing this emerging special force of China - the paratrooper warriors - would become newer and more vigorous every day!

Guangdong Voices for Democracy

Twenty-First Day, Guangzhou Air Dispatch - Our Special Correspondent, Liang Feng - In this season of high autumn and refreshing air, the most important news here is undoubtedly the provincial administrative conference that is watched by 35 million people. This conference was held in the Zhongzheng Middle School in Yuexiu Mountain, composed of more than 100 people, including attending commissioners, county magistrates, mayors, and specially invited or designated attendees, forming a great scene. This is really a grand event for the post-war Guangdong provincial government; from reports, reviews, to discussion of proposals, it took a full 12 days; in the policy reports of various commissioners, county magistrates, and mayors, we learned about a common situation in the localities, that is, financial difficulties, which affected administrative facilities; and when reviewing the work, everyone could frankly admit shortcomings and humbly exchange opinions, which can be said to be the most successful part of the meeting. In addition to the detailed discussion of the major topics of people, finance, construction, and education, the province's five-year construction plan has also been researched and important decisions made; this is indeed giving the people of the province a new hope for the future provincial government, although the cost of this conference is said to have been more than 60 million, and the travel expenses of the attendees and other indirect expenses are even more than this number, but as long as it truly benefits the people of the province, I believe the people will not be stingy.

At the meeting, Chairman Luo repeatedly emphasized "establishing a strict political atmosphere" and "purifying the government style to correct the people's spirit"; Li Yangjing, the director of the Civil Affairs Department, also said: "Today, the duty of the county magistrate is not only to win the hearts of the people, but also to regain the hearts of the people..." These are all what everyone is happy to hear. However, just as the solemn meeting was in progress, a rather "disappointing" thing happened, that is, a total of seven county magistrates, including those of Nan'ao, Zengcheng, Sihui, Pingyuan, Ruyuan, and Dongguan, were accused of corruption and malpractice by the local councils and people's organizations. Now the Civil Affairs Department is sending people to thoroughly investigate; whether the county magistrates are corrupt or the councils are making false accusations, I believe there will be a clear result soon.

After the administrative conference closed, there was another grand event following, that is, the first formal Guangdong Provincial Council, which opened on the scheduled National Day; because this is also a matter of 35 million people, the eyes of 35 million people are focused on this election of the speaker of the council. The election of the speaker of the council is scheduled to be held on October 11, which is only a few days away, so the figures participating in the election of the speaker are now facing the most tense stage. Newspapers use considerable space every day to publish news about the election, and news reporters have been overwhelmed this week by the rotation of invitations from the candidates!

There were originally five people participating in the election of the speaker of the council: Yu Junxian, Lin Yizhong, Luo Yiqun, Lin Wenbo, and He Tong; needless to say, these are all figures with a long history and great prestige in the party and the country: Yu Junxian is a member of the Central Committee, the current director of the Guangdong Provincial Party Headquarters, and has always been loved by the people of Guangdong Province. He has long been known as the "red man" of Guangdong Province. This time, he has the most votes from party affairs personnel elected as councilors, so his strength is also the greatest. Lin Yizhong is the current speaker of the Provisional Council, and also a member of the Central Committee. The central government has always attached great importance to him. He also has Chen Bonan as his backing, so his economic conditions are also better than other candidates. In addition, he served as the Director of the Civil Affairs Department during the Chen Bonan era, so this time he seems to be the most vocal candidate. Luo Yiqun and Lin Wenbo are both veterans of the party and the country. This time, they have erected this signboard, which naturally won people's respect; what Luo holds is probably the councilors from the Dongjiang area, and what Lin holds is the votes from the councilors from the Nanlu area, so compared with Yu Junxian and Lin Yizhong, Luo and Lin are not much weaker. As for He Tong, because of the lack of economic conditions, his activity conditions are inferior to others in this money world, so his prestige is the weakest; but he has the old qualifications of the first term of Baoding Military Academy, and he served as the Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Guangdong Province for seven years during the War of Resistance, a people-friendly official who best understands the people's sentiments and knows the people's hidden sufferings, so his position as the speaker is also an ideal one.

Looking at the above five people, each has its own merits, and it is difficult to predict who will win the position of speaker. However, in the midst of the fierce election, Yu Junxian suddenly announced his abandonment, which caused a new change in the entire election situation. Regarding the reasons for Yu's sudden abandonment of the election, some said that Yu received a secret letter from the Central Committee as long as seven pages, strongly urging him to give up the competition and concentrate on presiding over party affairs; others said that he gave up because the political authorities did not express support and his personal economy did not have this power; there are many opinions, and no one can agree; however, according to Yu's own statement of the reasons and process for this abandonment, he said: "Yu is the director of the Provincial Party Headquarters, and should always consider the interests of the party and the people of Guangdong. The party hopes that in the first popularly elected council, a large number of comrades and people who believe in the Three People's Principles should participate in the elections in various counties and support their success, so as to enrich the future council and realize the democratic politics of the Three People's Principles. This time, the comrades who participated in the elections in various counties have been supported by the voters and have been elected, and Yu's mission has been completed; as for those who are running for the speaker of the council, it has been determined, and it can be judged that those who are likely to be elected are all comrades of our party, and no matter who is elected in the future, they will be able to implement the party's propositions. From the perspective of the Provincial Party Headquarters, it can be said that the mission has been completed, so I really have no need to engage in the election again." After Yu's statement, the public's doubts were naturally cleared up; therefore, the general public believes that this is the result of the Kuomintang's open policy.

As for the opinions of the military and political authorities on this election of the speaker, they unanimously advocate respecting public opinion. Zhang Fakui, the director of the headquarters, said in a speech on the 2nd: "The establishment of the Provincial Formal Council is the prelude to the implementation of democratic politics in our province. The choice of its speaker should first respect public opinion. The council is an agency of public opinion, representing public opinion. Whoever the people want to elect as the speaker is entirely an expression of the people's own opinions." As for the provincial government, although a certain party had indicated to Chairman Luo, asking him to support a certain person, Chairman Luo has never expressed his opinion. In this way, it can be seen that Chairman Luo's opinion is of course standing on the position of fully respecting public opinion.

Then, what is the expression of the people themselves? According to the reporter's observation from the streets and alleys, everyone does not seem to have a very strong interest in the election of the speaker of the council; everyone's meaning seems to be: it does not matter who becomes the speaker of the council. In today's serious social problems, the people's suffering has nowhere to appeal. As long as the council can truly take the people as its foundation, seek welfare for the people, and call for the people's suffering, assist the government in remedying what the people lack, and convey the true public opinion, the people's sentiments, and the people's hidden sufferings to the government, then it is the same whoever becomes the speaker of the council!

Hunan's Educational Difficulties Obtain Effective Solutions

Thirteenth Day, Changsha Air Dispatch - Our Special Correspondent, Gao Yuanli - Wang Fengjie, the director of the Hunan Education Department, went to Beijing last month to ask the central authorities to allocate funds for the province's educational recovery. Now that the matter is over, he returned to Changsha on the 12th. According to his words to the reporter, he went to Beijing this time to report on his duties and ask for instructions on solutions to various educational problems. Because the problems involve a wide range, it took a lot of time, but solutions have been obtained.

### Funding for National Middle Schools Has Been Resolved

(1) Regarding the issue of receiving students and funds from national middle schools, national middle schools were originally established to provide relief to students in the war zone. After the victory, the situation changed, and the Ministry of Education decided that middle schools should be run by the provinces in principle. It was decided that national middle schools would be closed in the first semester of this year, and all students from national middle schools would be distributed by their original provincial education departments to study. The faculty and staff of national middle schools would be assigned by their original provincial education departments to serve. The original funds for national middle schools would be distributed to the provinces according to the number of faculty and staff and the number of students in each province. This decision is reasonable in principle, but there are many difficulties in implementation. It is difficult for provincial schools to recover, there is a lack of school buildings, and it is impossible to accommodate national middle school students. If new schools are established, the construction and equipment will cost a lot, and the construction funds allocated by the Ministry of Education are very small and cannot be supplied. The faculty, staff, and students of national middle schools are ordered to return to their original places of origin, but the number of faculty and staff and the number of students affiliated with each province may not have a suitable ratio, and the courses they teach may not be coordinated with actual needs. Moreover, due to various reasons, it is not easy to accurately count the places of origin, and the students of each national middle school are combined into one school, and the number of classes and students in several schools varies, making it impossible to establish an accurate budget. Moreover, due to traffic difficulties, the national middle schools have not been able to close as scheduled, so the funds for August and September are still issued to the national middle schools, and the funds for the provinces to take over are not available. More than 4,000 students from national middle schools distributed in Hunan Province are large in number, and the problem is even more serious. After repeated consultations with the Secondary Education Department of the Ministry of Education, the results are as follows: (1) The food expenses for publicly funded students will be tentatively set at 2,400 from October, calculated at 15,000 yuan per month per student, and will be paid by the ministry. (2) The Ministry will provide regular expenses and living allowances based on 40 student classes and 160 faculty members from October onwards, which will be allocated in a unified manner, and the registered Hunan faculty and staff of the National Middle School will be given priority for employment. The above figures are obviously not enough to meet actual needs. It will be difficult to feel the difficulties in August and September. The director of the Secondary Education Department believes that the situation of the recovery of national middle schools is complicated, and many schools still need to continue to spend, so the quota and funds allocated to each province must be tightened to avoid exceeding the budget, and it is allowed to be adjusted in the future. The National Yuanling Middle School is under the supervision of the Youth Army Resumption of School and Employment Guidance Committee. After the school was transferred to the province, it was agreed that the funds for this year will still be issued by the Transfer Committee in the form of provincial procedures. After the Chadong Normal School was ordered to be transferred to the province, people from all walks of life requested that the school, which is located in the border area of Sichuan, Hunan, and Guizhou, should remain national due to its special nature. The Ministry of Education has especially granted its request and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for approval, and it is expected that an order will be issued soon.

### Three Provincial Vocational Schools Will Be Temporarily Merged

(2) The issue of the restoration and reorganization of the three provincial vocational schools of agriculture, industry, and commerce. These three schools were approved by the Ministry of Education in August of the 33rd year [1944] to be reorganized into colleges, but due to the war, they were suspended before they could be implemented. After the victory, the plan was to restore them. The Ministry instructed that there was no need to reorganize them into colleges, so it formulated a plan based on the actual situation to restore the schools first. The Ministry of Education believed that after the war, Hunan's culture and education suffered unprecedented damage, funds were difficult, and material resources were scarce, so it was not easy to restore vocational schools. It ordered the three vocational schools to refrain from restoring the schools. At the same time, the Provincial Council repeatedly consulted the government to reorganize the schools into colleges. The two were far apart. The Sparrow Mansion weighed the actual situation and proposed a concrete plan, consulting the Ministry of Education to allow the three provincial schools of agriculture, industry, and commerce to be merged and renamed as the Keqiang College to commemorate the sage, and to establish a preparatory committee for the Keqiang College to engage in preparations. The author reported this plan to the Ministry and gave a detailed explanation of the situation in Hunan Province. Regarding the continued operation of the three vocational schools, the Ministry of Education has fully agreed, but due to the difficulty of school buildings, they will be temporarily merged, and they will be separated in the future. This year, they will concentrate their efforts to enrich the content and not recruit new students. Regarding the issue of reorganization into colleges, the Ministry of Education insisted on its original proposal. After repeated statements, the Keqiang College was allowed to be prepared, but the departments must be simple, and funds should be raised and equipment enriched. After sending personnel to inspect and believe that it meets the standards, it can be established. Regarding the issue of funding, it should be proposed to allocate it from the grain warehouse coupons returned to Hunan Province by the central government. The Ministry of Education strongly agreed, but this matter must be passed by the public opinion organ before it can be handled. The old Fifth Middle School houses in Hengyang were ordered to be transferred by the Hankou Air Force Fourth Military Region Command by the hand of Commander Zhou Zhirou. They still need to be negotiated with the local air force station.

### Provincial School Restoration Funds Can Be Allocated and Issued

(3) Regarding the issue of requesting additional educational recovery funds, the loss of education and culture in Hunan Province is estimated to be 90 billion, and the restoration fee is estimated to be more than 50 billion. The last time the central government approved only 1.4 billion, which is far from the actual need. Both public and private schools feel difficult. I will request the Executive Yuan to increase the restoration fee to meet the urgent need. I was instructed that the state's financial resources are difficult, and Hunan Province is already superior. In the future, the restoration of various provinces should be self-reliant, but the site of the Nanyue Provincial School has been transferred to the National Teachers College, and Hunan Province has distributed many students from the National Middle School. The situation is special, and the provincial school restoration fee can be increased appropriately.

Eight Years of Military Students at Caotang Temple

October 20, Chengdu Civil Aviation News - Holy - People are like wearing school uniforms, and the river is surging and endless, running on the Chengyu Highway. When the car steps on the Longquanyi (25 kilometers from Chengdu) mountain, it slowly climbs up and slowly opens down. You will see a distant, lower jungle, which is like a sweet sleeping child lying tenderly in the arms of his mother. - That is the Chengdu Plain you yearn for. Everyone who has been to Chengdu knows about Caotang Temple. In the past, it was famous and powerful. During the War of Resistance, it was a strong revolutionary fortress.

The dawn of the East is about to break through the dark night, and everything on the earth is dead and shrouded in darkness. At this time, a burst of singing suddenly came from the southwest corner of Rongcheng. The sound was so majestic, loud, and intense. This alarm-like singing floated to Tiangu, floated to Yougu, floated to the dead city; floated to millions of miles away, awakening all the intoxicated people. This singing can represent the roar of the Chinese nation, the cry of the oppressed. This great holy place is the base where the Whampoa heroes who persisted in the revolution and the War of Resistance were trained. The revolutionary furnace - Caotang Temple. This is the famous Caotang Temple in Sichuan, the home of the proud poet, and the blessed place for Buddhist practitioners.

Every spring, "cars and horses gather heavily" in an endless stream. Many people are admiring, marveling, praying, and worshiping the towering temples and brilliant palaces. In the camphor forest, you can see the dazzling glass, the establishment of white powder walls, the exquisite plaques, and the solemn statues of gods. People's hearts are attracted by this paradise, forgetting sins, greed, ...

Now, in this quiet temple, there are thousands of young people stationed. They come from all corners of the world, the southern country, the isolated island, the vast Gobi Desert, ... and other different directions and different regions. Under the call of the same banner, they come to this glorious and mobilizing anti-Japanese group of the times, and throw themselves into the furnace of this great era. These young people are rippling with lively spirit and surging vitality, so pure and so sacred. Thousands of strong arms like iron have gathered together, forging the light of freedom. The children of the motherland, a group of anti-Japanese fires, burning steel chests, are being tempered in the melting pot.

Although the road is surrounded by countless Sakyamuni believers, under the military orders and orders, when the children of the motherland think of the surging blood waves on the Whampoa River, and the moment when the vast wilderness is trampled by animal hooves, they more calmly think of "the white bones of the old father are still buried on the Lugou Bridge and on the banks of the Yongding River." This heartbreaking grief accelerated the boiling of their blood.

The sky was just showing the color of fish belly, the fog on the mountain had not yet dissipated, the villagers had not yet woken up, and the city people were having sweet dreams. The startling bugle woke up this group of partners. So, they began a vigorous and tiger-like combat life. On the playground and in the wild, they moved like fierce tigers. In the lecture hall and dormitory, they were as quiet as virgins. When raising the flag or listening to training, they stood solemnly and towering. In their spare time or during rest, they jumped and were lively as much as possible, giving full play to the vitality of youth.

At dusk, all the people rested, and the western moon was already hanging high on the tree. At this time, "the angry tide is surging, the party flag is flying..." The solemn and tragic school song resounded in every corner of Caotang Temple. This group of spirited partners was like a death god going to a dreamland.

Day after day passed, and every minute was lived in tension. In the morning light, after dawn, when the ruthless sun was shining, in the moonlight, on the wide playground, there were always countless crowds moving. Listen, the loud bugle is roaring...

"Fight, fight!... We are the youth of New China!... We are the combatants of Whampoa... The great principal leads us forward... Students must be diligent... endure hardship... be quick and sure... Our team is vast and boundless."

With light steps, "one two three four", thousands of legs seemed to be walking by one person, row by row, column by column, left and right, vertical and horizontal, all in a straight line. These children, red and black eyes, were growing hotly here.

For eight years, Caotang Temple has dedicated itself to the motherland, making its greatest efforts, and like the surging waves of the river. It has created countless stalwart warriors, spread all over the major battlefields in the north and south, rushing forward and fighting with the enemy day and night! Stepping on the blood of the martyrs, sacrificing their own heads, and sprinkling bright red blood to exchange for the freedom and happiness of the motherland.

Now, the great task has been accomplished, the rivers and mountains have been restored, and the victory has been restored. We cannot but attribute this to the flesh and blood struggle of the Whampoa soldiers. However, thinking of the Whampoa heroes in the War of Resistance, we cannot forget this Caotang Temple, which is located in the western suburbs of Rongcheng. It has indirectly made supreme contributions.

Writing here, I see the lighthouse of peace shining on the land of the recovered areas. In Shanghai, Nanjing, Beiping, Wuhan! In the major cities, the pre-war prosperity and bustle have been restored, and the lights and wine are strongly intoxicating the people who have returned victorious. These military students are scattered all over the world, and the immature students who remain are also about to leave Rongcheng for Beiping. The immortal Caotang Temple still lies quietly alone in the western suburbs of Rongcheng, Sichuan, which makes people feel reluctant.

Visiting Du Yuming

Seventeenth Day, Shenyang Dispatch - Our Shenyang Correspondent, Zhao Zhan - General Du Yuming lives in his green official residence. This house used to belong to a Korean named Kim, whom the people in Northeast China call Goryeo Kim. He was a rich man. This house can be said to be the most comfortable residence in Shenyang, but it is not luxurious on the surface. The Northeast Zhongzheng University, which General Du founded, is next to it.

It was a sunny afternoon at four o'clock. Outside, the north wind was shaking the fallen leaves. I was led by an adjutant to a living room. A famous painting of "Cossacks" was hung on the wall of the living room, and a half-length military portrait of General Du was newly added. It was painted and presented by a Japanese.

Finally, General Du came and shook hands with the reporter cordially. We sat on the leather sofa and talked. The questions were not the draft that had been prepared in advance. The conversation was conducted in the form of a chat. He kept smoking. I thought it was after dinner.

When I interviewed Mr. Liu Handong, Chairman of Liaobei, the purpose was very different. He explained the military situation to his subordinates like a staff officer of a division, talking endlessly about the Battle of Xifeng. It was entirely military, and political issues were rarely discussed.

General Du said that the communist army was preparing to retreat to the border mountain areas bordering Mongolia, North Korea, and the Soviet Union, with something to rely on behind them, as if to say that it would be more difficult to fight again. The reporter asked about the story of the hundreds of thousands of Japanese troops remaining in the primeval forests of the Dian'anling Mountains. He said that it was nonsense.

General Du said that the reporter could follow the army to Benxi, Andong and other places to take a look. He had answered the reporter's question, that is, the national army was going to drive out the communist army in the coastal corridor on the east side of the railway, because the communist army in this area was too threatening to the China Chang Railway.

Regarding the war in Rehe, General Du said that the people there were suffering too much and must be rescued. At this time, the national army captured Weichang. He said that Chifeng could be recovered in one or two days, and the national army on the outskirts of Zhangjiakou still had 70 li [a traditional unit of distance] to go. Marshal Ma in Nanjing had a suggestion to stop the war for ten days, but he said that he could take it down in three days. He was right.

General Du's health has fully recovered. He has taken off his blue silk gown for summer rest and recuperation and put on his khaki military uniform. I asked him about his views on the prospects for peace and war. He said meaningfully: "Fighting is also peace, and peace is also fighting."

He finished his last cigarette without any fatigue. The reporter said goodbye and came out. Looking at his watch, it was waiting for one hour, and talking for one and a half hours was still worth it!

Autumn Eve on the Front Line

Bai Min

After a year since the victory, eight or nine out of ten of the experiences of the eight-year war have been forgotten. Today, when peace has not been fully restored, many of the painful experiences of the

### Chairman Departs Shanghai and Returns to the Capital, Immediately Summons Government Negotiation Representatives, Inquires About the Latest Situation in Peace Talks

[Our Newspaper's Report] Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and his wife arrived in Shanghai from Taiwan on the 27th. After staying in Shanghai for a total of twenty hours, they departed Shanghai at 10:30 a.m. on the 28th and returned to Nanjing. Chairman and Mrs. Chiang arose at 6:00 a.m. on the 28th, and at 8:30 a.m. received Wu Zhihui, a Party and State elder statesman, at their official residence. The meeting lasted approximately fifteen minutes. Mr. Wu bid farewell, and the Chairman personally escorted him to the side of the living room door, watching him get into his car before returning inside. At 9:30 a.m., he summoned Mayor Wu [Guozhen] and Commander Xuan [Tie Wu] to his residence and informed them of his impending departure from Shanghai. The Chairman and his wife then departed their official residence on Dongping Road at 10:10 a.m. in car number 17445, heading to Longhua Airport, where they immediately boarded the plane. Those seeing them off at the airport included Mayor Wu, Commander Xuan, Wu Shaoshu, Qian Dajun, and more than ten others. Dozens of citizens remained waiting nearby the plane to admire the Chairman and his wife's demeanor. The Chairman was still dressed in a long gown and black mandarin jacket, draped in a black cloak, and held a felt hat. His wife wore a black coat over a long green floral-printed cheongsam. After shaking hands with each of the well-wishers, the Chairman nodded repeatedly, saying, "Good, good, goodbye, goodbye." He then stepped into the "Meiling" special plane, which took off at 10:30 a.m. Those accompanying the Chairman on the same plane included Yu Jishi, Director of the Bureau of Military Affairs, and Secretary Zhou Hongji. Chen Xizeng, Director of the General Affairs Bureau, Secretaries Shen Changhuan and Cao Shengfen, and attendants, among others, took another plane back. Before leaving Shanghai yesterday, the Chairman inquired in great detail from Mayor Wu and Commander Xuan about the city's prices, people's livelihood, and public security, and gave some instructions. At the same time, he also summoned Tao Yishan, Chief of the Inspection Department of the Garrison Headquarters, and gave instructions on public security policies. Li Jishen, Deputy Dean of the Military Council, and his wife went to pay their respects, and the Chairman also summoned them for a meeting.

[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Chairman Chiang and his wife flew back to Nanjing at 11:30 a.m. on the 28th aboard the Meiling special plane. Initially, because the Chairman's whereabouts were uncertain, only Zhou Zhirou, Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force, and Chiang Ching-kuo were waiting at the airport to greet them. The special plane landed at Ming Palace Airport. After the plane door opened, the attendant first took down the Chairman's cloak and walking stick, and the wife's wide-brimmed straw hat. The wife disembarked first, followed by the Chairman. The Chairman smiled and nodded. Today, the capital's autumn sky was overcast, and the west wind brought a strong autumnal feel. The Chairman was in excellent spirits. He immediately boarded car number 1982 and left the airport, heading directly to his official residence to rest.

[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] All government and Political Consultative Conference (PCC) representatives, as well as Chen Cheng, Bai Chongxi, Yu Dawei, Peng Xuepei, etc., were summoned to a banquet by the Chairman at 7:30 p.m. They went to the Huangpu Road official residence to report on the situation of the peace talks during the Chairman's absence from Nanjing and the contents of the new proposals made by the Democratic League, the Youth Party, and social elites. The Chairman inquired in great detail, but because the plan still awaited final revision, he did not make any kind of statement. At approximately 9:00 p.m., the PCC representatives left the official residence. Sun Ke, Shao Lizi, and Lei Zhen then went together to visit the Democratic League representatives at Lanjiazhuang to convey some of the Chairman's opinions.

[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Special Envoy Marshall visited the Chairman at 4:00 p.m. on the 28th for talks on everything.

### Third-Party New Ceasefire Proposal, To Be Resubmitted After Revision Today, Documents Sent to All Parties Temporarily Withdrawn Yesterday

[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] After a week of back-and-forth negotiation among the Democratic League, the Youth Party, and social elites in off-site talks, a plan suitable for resolving the current situation was finally obtained on the 28th. They gathered at 9:00 a.m. on the 28th to conduct a final and meticulous study. When they believed it was perfect, they decided to send this written plan to both the Nationalists and Communists after the meeting and notify the American mediator. The meeting adjourned at 11:00 a.m. First, Luo Longji, Li Huang, and Miao Jiaming visited Special Envoy Marshall to verbally inform him of the content of this proposal. They left at approximately 12:00 noon. In the afternoon, Luo and others visited government representative Sun Ke at 1:00 p.m. and then Special Envoy Marshall again at 2:00 p.m., and then Communist representative Zhou Enlai at 3:00 p.m., respectively handing them the written document of the proposal. At 4:00 p.m., the government representatives immediately gathered at Sun Ke's residence to study the proposal. While conducting a preliminary study, Luo Longji of the Democratic League and others returned, explaining that the content and wording of the proposal still needed to be revised and discussed, and requested to take it back for further revision. They immediately took it back to Lanjiazhuang. Luo and others also went to Special Envoy Marshall's residence three times to give the same explanation and retrieve the document. At the same time, while Liang Shuming and others were discussing it with Zhou Enlai and others, Luo and others returned and also retrieved that document. They then gathered at the Bank of Communications to discuss the areas that needed to be revised, and dispersed at approximately 8:00 p.m. After returning to Lanjiazhuang, Liang Shuming and four others went to Meiyuan New Village to visit Zhou Enlai for talks, which lasted until 10:00 p.m. When government PCC representatives Sun, Shao, and Lei visited the Democratic League representatives at Lanjiazhuang at 9:00 p.m., they studied the proposal that had been issued and then retracted, talking for two hours. Sun and the others only left at 11:15 p.m.

The reporter was waiting in the downstairs reception room and saw that Sun's face had a happy expression, while Shao, wearing a long robe and mandarin jacket, returned a pleasant smile to the waiting reporter. When the reporter asked about the course of the conversation, he said that he had nothing to say. Then, Luo Longji said that this plan was the result of a week of study and dared not say it was successful, but could not be said to be a failure either. Today, because some parts of the content still needed to be discussed, it had been taken back. After the meeting on the 29th for revisions, it was decided to send it to both the Nationalists and Communists at 3:00 p.m. However, this was only a mediation opinion, and we cannot say for sure whether both parties will accept it. Subsequently, the reporter visited Lei Zhen at his private residence and inquired about the reason for visiting the Democratic League on the evening of the 28th. According to him, it was to find out the reason for retrieving the proposed documents.

Also, Zhang Junmai of the Democratic League, and Yu Jiaju and Zuo Shunsheng of the Youth Party, went to Shanghai on the 28th in the afternoon aboard the Triumph Army.

[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] It is reported that the new proposal of the Democratic League, the Youth Party, and social elites mainly consists of three items, namely the ceasefire zone, local regime, and the implementation of PCC resolutions, among other major issues, with some additional detailed rules. As of the night of the 28th, all parties had remained silent and had not disclosed anything.

### President Sun's Statement

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] President of the Executive Yuan Sun Ke, regarding the slightly different contents of the reports in various newspapers about his talks in recent days, specifically issued a statement to the Central News Agency reporter on the 28th, saying: "Since Mr. Zhou Enlai and representatives of opposition parties and social elites came to Nanjing to begin informal discussions, we have exchanged opinions almost every day. Although there have been no particular difficulties, opinions have not yet been consistent. Therefore, the government representatives have not made any external statements. However, newspaper reporters have regarded me as one of the participants in the discussions, and some of the discussions have taken place at my residence. Therefore, they have asked me for news at various times. I have only provided information based on what I know and what can be published. Reporters have different viewpoints, and the details and omissions in their records are also inconsistent, which is not entirely consistent with my original intentions. It is also inconvenient for me to correct them one by one. In the future, if I am speaking on behalf of the government, it will naturally be officially published by the Central News Agency. As for the records that are independently collected and published by various newspapers, since they have not been reviewed by me before publication, I will naturally not be responsible for the content. This statement is made specifically to avoid any misunderstandings."
