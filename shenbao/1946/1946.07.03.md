### Chairman Met Zhou Enlai Yesterday Morning, Reaffirmed the Position of Seeking Peace, and Clearly Expressed the Principles for Handling the Northern Jiangsu Issue, Appointed Shao, Chen, and Wang as Government Representatives

"Our Newspaper Nanjing, 2nd" Chairman Chiang Kai-shek received Zhou Enlai, the central representative, in the reception room of the National Government Office Building at 10:00 this morning, accompanied by Shao Lizi. Those present and participating in the talks included Shao Lizi, Chen Cheng, Wang Shijie himself, and the meeting lasted about 45 minutes. After receiving the notification from Special Envoy Marshall yesterday, Zhou decided to pay a visit to Chairman Chiang this morning. It is said that Chairman Chiang's solemn and peaceful attitude towards Zhou's visit today was as usual; however, during the talks, his benevolent and kind intentions were evident in his words, deeply moving the other party. Zhou's demeanor during today's visit to the Chairman was also exceptionally respectful and courteous. Furthermore, Chairman Chiang designated Shao Lizi, Chen Cheng, and Wang Shijie today to regularly exchange views with Zhou on behalf of the government, in order to facilitate the greatest possible understanding between the two sides during the talks and to shorten the negotiation time.

"Our Newspaper Nanjing, 2nd" When Chairman Chiang met with Zhou Enlai this morning, he reiterated the government's position of seeking peace and elaborated on the government's consistent sincerity in using political solutions to negotiate a ceasefire and troop reorganization with the Communist Party. He hoped that the Communist Party would also make similar concessions to the government to promote national peace and unity and alleviate the suffering of the people. It is said that Zhou Enlai at the time elaborated on the Communist Party's attitude and put forward the following opinions regarding the future negotiation methods for military and political matters: (1) Regarding military or other issues involving military affairs, it is hoped that they will be discussed and resolved by a military three-person conference; (2) Regarding political issues, it is hoped that they will be discussed and resolved by the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) Comprehensive Group meeting. The Chairman immediately replied generously, saying: "The meetings between the two sides have lasted for years without much progress. The people's desire for peace and unity is extremely urgent. It is best to first resolve the issues on which discussions have yielded results and that are urgently awaiting resolution, and seek their implementation, in order to complete a stage of tasks. By making this achievement of mutual trust and reliance known to the people, we can then convene the PCC Comprehensive Group meeting." Zhou Enlai considered this to be merely a matter of meeting procedures and, without any hesitation, happily agreed.

"Our Newspaper Nanjing, 2nd" It is reported that when Chairman Chiang met with Zhou Enlai this morning, he directly expressed the government's principles for handling the general administrative issues in Northern Jiangsu and other areas after the Communist troops withdraw: (1) All administrative personnel should be selected and appointed by the government; (2) The government should send security teams to various places to maintain law and order; (3) In addition to the above two matters that must be the responsibility of the government, the Communist Party can discuss any opinions they may have. From this, it can be seen that the solution to the Northern Jiangsu issue has become clearer.

"Our Newspaper Nanjing, 2nd" In addition to visiting Chairman Chiang Kai-shek at the National Government this morning for his first visit since returning to the capital and exchanging views, Zhou Enlai had other activities. In the evening, Stuart Lei Deng, the president of Yenching University, visited Zhou and had a morning talk. Zhou then hosted Stuart at the Meiyuan New Village.

### KMT and CCP Representatives Negotiate Twice, Rao Shushi Changes Flight to Yan'an to Today

"Our Newspaper Nanjing, 2nd" Today was the first day of direct negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Marshall notified the representatives of both sides. The government representatives were Chen Cheng, Wang Shijie, and Shao Lizi, while the Communist Party representatives were Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu. In addition to the morning meeting, a meeting continued at the Chief of Staff Chen's office at 9:30 tonight, ending at 12:30. The content of the meeting was still a broad exchange of views, with the focus still on the issue of troop stationing. Today's meeting had no main topic, no staff, and no recording secretary. The meeting method will still be direct talks, notified by Marshal Marshall.

"Our Newspaper Nanjing, 2nd" Rao Shushi, the Communist representative of the Northeast Executive Group Changchun Executive Department, originally planned to fly to Yan'an on Marshal Marshall's plane at 8:00 this morning. However, due to bad weather, he flew back after one hour and is scheduled to be sent to Yan'an by the same plane at 8:00 tomorrow morning.

### Wedemeyer May Come to China, Marshall May Return Home

"United Press, 2nd, This City" It is said that Lieutenant General Wedemeyer, the former commander of the U.S. military in the China theater, may return to China. Many observers believe this is a prelude to Special Envoy Marshall's return to his country. Since there are not many U.S. troops stationed in China, Wedemeyer's arrival will certainly not be limited to serving as commander. It is said that if Marshall does return to his country, Lieutenant General Wedemeyer will take over the mission to seek China's peaceful reunification. Wedemeyer has extensive experience as the commander of the U.S. military in the China theater and is friendly with Chairman Chiang and other important figures in the KMT, as well as Zhou Enlai and others in the CCP. If he were to take over Marshall's delicate and complex work, or assist in everything during Marshall's stay in China, there would hardly be anyone more capable than Wedemeyer.

"This City" According to a senior official from the U.S. side participating in the formulation of the troop reorganization plan, he told reporters yesterday: "Special Envoy Marshall is now persuading both parties to bring their views closer together. During the nearly one-month negotiations, the demands of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are too far apart. The U.S. side is doing its best to help China achieve peace as soon as possible, regardless of all difficulties. Special Envoy Marshall is running around all day and is in good spirits. He is still exchanging views with both parties individually. He is not completely despaired of resolving China's internal strife, but it requires our efforts and time, not just overnight, to achieve results."

### Difficulties in Repairing Roads in the Northeast, Equipment Emptied

"Central News Agency, Shenyang, 2nd" Chen Yan, a member of the Ministry of Communications, reported to reporters this afternoon on the difficulties in the railway repair work in various parts of the Northeast in recent months and the difficulties that may be expected in the future. He said: "The total length of the railway in Northeast China is more than 10,000 kilometers. The Kuomintang army received about 3,000 kilometers. The equipment in the surrounding villages within this range has been completely emptied. Of the several machine repair factories in the Northeast, only the Huanggu Tun factory, originally belonging to the Beining Railway, is barely in use. In the past, the factory could repair 25 locomotives at the same time. Now, because 71 good machines have been removed, its efficiency is less than one-third of what it used to be. Repair work is even more difficult, and there is a lack of equipment. Today, the railway equipment being repaired is entirely taken from one place to make up for another. To repair bridges, they must be transported to Shanhaiguan for repair and then pulled back to the place of use. The permanent bridges in the Shenyang Shanhaiguan section, except for Suizhong, have been largely completed today. Originally, there were about 3,000 locomotives, but now there are only about 100 left. Of the tens of thousands of freight cars, there are only 800 freight cars and 141 passenger cars left."

### Issues Regarding the Deportation of German Nationals, Ministry of Foreign Affairs Issues Statement, Deportation List Determined by the Government, Outside Rumors Under Investigation

"Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd" Regarding the final decision on the list of deported German nationals, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the following statement in response to questions from various parties: "The Chinese government has always decided to deport German nationals with Nazi Party membership or engaged in Nazi activities. However, for some German nationals whose Nazi Party membership is not very clear and who have been investigated and found to have no behavior that harms China or the Allied nations, deportation may be delayed. When approving the delay, special consideration may be given to technical personnel employed by Chinese public and private institutions and organizations whose work is currently necessary. The above policy is the criterion for determining the deportation and delay of deportation of German nationals. As for who should be deported and who should be delayed, the decision is based on facts. However, there are many discrepancies in the reports from various parties on individual cases. The Chinese government must carefully review the information provided by its own country and the Allied nations. Although various parties have different opinions on certain cases, the final decision on the list of deportations and delayed deportations is entirely the responsibility of the Chinese government. There have been rumors that some German nationals, fearing deportation, have attempted to bribe Chinese organizations and individuals in Shanghai to seek exemption. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has long been aware of this. However, the Chinese government has already taken measures to prevent the responsible parties from being influenced by evil forces. The government has ordered the local authorities in charge of deporting German nationals to thoroughly investigate the above-mentioned rumors. The Shanghai authorities have also been ordered to thoroughly investigate the above-mentioned rumors and prevent any attempts by German nationals to evade deportation."

"United States Information Service, Washington, 1st" A State Department spokesman revealed today that China will deport a large number of Nazi Party members who have been active in China and have been listed as dangerous and undesirable elements by the United States. Many of them have already boarded ships awaiting departure, and another group will depart on July 7. Of the list submitted by the United States to the Chinese government, 40 names have not yet been seen on the two lists.

### Economic Planning Conference Day 2 Discussing Salvaging the Industrial Crisis Concrete Suggestions for Restricting Foreign Goods Imports Conference Adopts a Roundtable Format Without Any Resolutions

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] The Economic Planning Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs continued its second and third meetings on the 2nd, morning and afternoon respectively. In the morning, Chairman Wang Yunwu presided over the discussion, with the theme remaining "Administrative Outline of the Ministry of Economic Affairs for the 36th Year" from yesterday. In the afternoon, Deputy Chairman Xiao Zheng presided, with the theme being "Salvaging the Industrial Crisis". The enthusiasm of the committee members' speeches was as intense as yesterday. Before adjourning at 6 PM, the chairman announced that the discussion on "Salvaging the Industrial Crisis" was not yet exhausted and would continue tomorrow morning. During the continued discussion of the Administrative Outline in the morning, speakers unanimously focused on two major issues: provincial enterprises and the handling of enemy-occupied factories. The former issue had opposing viewpoints, leading to heated debate, but ultimately, it was agreed that improper management of provincial enterprises could lead to economic fragmentation. However, if provincial operation was a means and not an end, it could still promote economic construction. Regarding the handling of enemy-occupied factories, many committee members stated that the government should prioritize economic considerations, improve the current bidding process, and quickly implement leasing and other methods to rationally distribute factories to those who contributed during the war. Deputy Chairman Pan Xulun then reported on his experience participating in the Enemy and Puppet Industry Handling Review Committee of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui region, explaining the difficulties in the handling process. In the afternoon's discussion of "Salvaging the Industrial Crisis," the committee members were either economic scholars or leading figures in the industry, so everyone felt a heavy sense of concern. From 3 PM to 6 PM, only the issues of restricting imports of foreign goods and foreign exchange rates were discussed, with a lingering desire to say more. Several committee members spoke with particular fervor about promoting domestic goods and also made concrete and valuable suggestions for restricting imports. Before the adjournment, Pi Zuoqiong, a representative from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, was granted special permission to speak, hoping that the committee members could also address the crisis of domestic and foreign sales of agricultural products, just as they were discussing effective countermeasures for industry.

### Editorial The World After the Atomic Bomb Test

The American Super Fortress "Dave's Dream" dropped the fourth atomic bomb over Bikini Atoll early yesterday morning. People around the world are worried about the future of the world and are eager to know: After this test, what is the power of the atomic bomb against the Navy? The Americans call this test "Crossroads," meaning that the future of the world is either peace or destruction, and it will be clear after this test. Therefore, this test by the US Army and Navy has profound significance. Not only will the huge sound of this explosion shake the entire world, but human history will also record the echo of this huge sound.

The United States has been preparing for this large-scale test for a long time. In the waters near Bikini Atoll, more than 70 ships of various sizes were arranged in a circle, acting as targets for the atomic bomb, and the surrounding deployment was even more meticulous like a net. The United States directly spent 70 million US dollars for this test, and indirect expenses are more than 500 million US dollars. Although the United States is a country of gold, it will not waste this huge sum of money lightly. Other countries also attach great importance to this, especially those countries that do not know the mystery of the atomic bomb, and want to know the results of this test. Therefore, politicians, diplomats, scientists, news reporters, and photographers from various countries have gone to visit the test. No one does not want to witness the miracle created by the fourth atomic bomb in the world. However, when they happily went to Bikini Atoll in the Pacific Ocean, scientists and seismologists, who did not know the situation, suddenly issued alarming warnings to them. Some said that the explosion of an atomic bomb in the sea would split the earth's crust into two, and no one would survive to report the results of this test. Others said that all the fish in the sea would suffer a catastrophe, and none would be spared. Some even said that the world's climate would also change as a result. Although these are all alarming words, this test has a very important meaning for the entire world and will change the future world situation.

Today is only the third day after the fourth atomic bomb exploded, and it is impossible to know the full results of this large-scale test. According to Vice Admiral Blandy, who is in charge of the atomic bomb test, "Operation Crossroads has been truly successful!" The extent of the damage to the target warships is still under investigation. Therefore, as of this writing, it is still not appropriate to speculate on the power of the atomic bomb against the Navy. The news released by various foreign news agencies is actually only superficial. Atomic experts and personnel actually responsible for the test will not easily express their opinions on this large-scale test. Moreover, the atomic bomb seems to be regarded as the only magic weapon for the United States to maintain world peace, and the United States may not be willing to publicly release the test results immediately. What Vice Admiral Blandy called "true success" is still an era of silent mysteries, both believable and unbelievable. But no matter what the results of this test are, the atomic bomb issue is still the core of mutual suspicion between the United States and the Soviet Union, and it is also the key to world peace and destruction. As Mr. May, Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said, "No matter what the results of the Bikini test are, the attitude of the Atomic Energy Control Commission will not change."

What the Soviet Union is most dissatisfied with in the United States is that the United States is unwilling to make the secret of atomic energy public, and has repeatedly accused the United States of threatening with atomic bombs, calling US diplomacy atomic diplomacy, and even attributing the failure of all international conferences after the war to the United States' keeping the secret of atomic energy. Recently, Soviet public opinion has gone a step further, ridiculing that most Americans suffer from "atomic disease." This US atomic bomb test has added another stimulus to the Soviet Union, further exacerbating the Soviet people's "atomic fear disease." In terms of the current international situation, in order to eliminate the suspicion between the United States and the Soviet Union, and to break the current international deadlock, solving the atomic energy issue is indeed a matter of urgency. Recently, at a meeting of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, US representative Baruch proposed that atomic energy should be controlled by international organizations, and declared that the United States would hand over and destroy all atomic bombs after the establishment of international organizations, and would no longer manufacture them. The committee has designated the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France, Mexico, and Australia to form a subcommittee to draft an atomic bomb management plan. We believe that Baruch's proposal is a gospel for world peace, and countries should quickly draft a management plan. Unfortunately, Soviet representative Gromyko still expressed his disagreement and put forward another proposal, which was not agreed by the United States. The dispute between the two countries lies in the issue of the "veto." The two sides have different opinions on the existence of the veto, which has once again stalled this most serious issue. Good things take time, which really makes people who desire world peace feel discouraged.

Scientists invented the atomic bomb, which made a great contribution to the early end of World War II, and brought this world into the atomic age. If atomic energy can be applied to industrial production, it will be of great benefit to the happiness of all mankind. Unfortunately, this monster of atomic energy is still only at the stage of a deadly weapon, which has led to mutual suspicion between the United States and the Soviet Union. Therefore, we deeply hope that this large-scale experiment in Bikini can give all mankind a shocking lesson, and from then on, achieve a great understanding, no longer suspect each other between countries, but be able to cooperate sincerely, and turn the deadly weapon into a blessing for mankind. In this way, the world after the war can also step into a new era of peace and prosperity.

Pinghu A Large Group of Bandits Robbed the West Gate

After the Lao Yuan Xingxiang Silver Shop in the downtown area of the county was robbed on the morning of June 26, Xu Po Bridge to the West Mengjia Bridge outside the West Gate was robbed again at about 11 PM on the 28th. More than 30 bandits, all armed with weapons, including 2 light machine guns and 14 or 15 short guns, seemed to be organized, and went to the town chief's residence in an attempt to kill him. The robbery lasted for about an hour. The Taiyuan Bamboo Shop lost more than 2 million yuan in cash, the Xidingfeng Sauce Garden lost more than 600,000 yuan in gold rings, clothing, and cash, Wang Wanchang Rice Shop, Feng Shunxing Medical Clinic, Yuankang, Zhenchang, Gongji, Shengxie and other rice shops, Zhengxing Department Store, Xun Chang Fruit Shop, and the residence of Wang Qiuchuan, the owner of Shengxie Rice Shop, each lost about 100 yuan. After the robbery, they fired their guns and headed northwest. The reporter visited the victims and learned that the bandits were mostly from Anhui and Jiangbei, with dark complexions. They must have served in the army. At about 8 AM on the 29th, the county magistrate personally went to investigate. On the afternoon of the same day, he convened an emergency security meeting. Robberies have occurred in the past three or four days, and residents are uneasy and eager for the authorities to quickly suppress them.

### Soviet Representative Accepts Compromise: Trieste Port Designated Autonomous Zone; Agreement Reached on Yugoslav-Italian Border; Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference Takes Dramatic Turn

[Report from Our Newspaper] London, 2nd (Radio Broadcast): The Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference took a dramatic turn today. The Soviet Union has accepted the French-proposed compromise to designate the Port of Trieste as an autonomous zone.

[United Press Paris, 2nd] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has accepted the western Yugoslav border line, from Taizitsiou to Gorizia, and then descending a few miles east of Trieste, directly south to the coast at Kabardiskuria. This border will cause Yugoslavia to lose the Tevia railway from Austria to the coast, and the Monfalcone shipyard will remain Italian property. Molotov's acceptance of this border, along with his acceptance of the French plan for international control of Trieste, represents a significant concession on the part of the Soviet Union. Molotov had previously proposed an international control plan for Trieste that would have placed it completely within Yugoslav encirclement, which was rejected by U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes.

### MacArthur Returns to Manila; Attends Philippine Independence Ceremony; Celebrations of Unprecedented Scale

[United Press Manila, 2nd] General MacArthur, accompanied by his wife and son, arrived here from Japan today aboard his personal transport aircraft, the "Bataan," to attend the Philippine Independence Ceremony on July 4th. MacArthur received a grand welcome upon arrival at Nichols Field. Philippine President Roxas and U.S. High Commissioner McNutt were both at the airport. After disembarking, MacArthur reviewed the 68th Division honor guard, and a 19-gun salute was fired in his honor. This is MacArthur's first visit to the Philippines since leaving Manila when Japan surrendered last August.

[United Press Manila, 2nd] The war-torn Philippine capital is today preparing to celebrate the July 4th Independence Ceremony on a scale unprecedented since the landing of Spanish troops four hundred years ago. Philippine independence will mark the culmination of three hundred years of Spanish feudal rule, the bloody struggle against Japanese aggression, and forty-five years of political progress under American protection. Hundreds of thousands of people from all over the country, led by 116 official representatives, are flocking to the capital to participate in the grand ceremony, causing traffic congestion. The city's population is at least one million, and it is expected to double when the independence ceremony is held. U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines, McNutt, will host a banquet tomorrow to entertain Philippine dignitaries and prominent figures visiting the capital. President Roxas will also hold a formal banquet at the same time to entertain guests from all walks of life.

### On the Eve of Philippine Independence: President Roxas' Declaration: Willing to Maintain Cooperation with the United States and Allied Nations

[United Press Manila, 1st] Philippine President Roxas today instructed United Press to publish a declaration stating: "In my capacity as President of the Philippines, I hereby declare my sincere willingness to cooperate openly with the foreign policy of the United States, especially with the policies pursued in the Far East and by the United Nations. I acknowledge the United States' leading position in the Far East and have great confidence in its noble objectives and altruistic spirit. I dare say that the foreign policy of the United States will always be based on such noble ideals. The United States certainly does not seek to gain any benefit in any part of the Far East. I not only firmly desire to express cooperation with the policies pursued by the United States in the Philippines, but I also want to do everything possible to ensure that the permanent land, sea, and air force bases that the United States wants to establish here are secured."

Close Military and Economic Ties

"In addition, I also intend to formulate methods for defending the Philippines so that they are closely linked to the U.S. plan to defend Philippine bases. We will also do our best to organize the Philippine Army so that it can cooperate fully with the U.S. troops stationed here. Furthermore, I will encourage American capital to flow into the Philippines. The islands have suffered greatly from the war and are economically in a state of collapse. There is insufficient capital to fund reconstruction. Therefore, if the United States does not invest, we will inevitably have to rely on other countries. To avoid future political disputes and to prevent the Philippines from being placed in an extremely dangerous situation, I would like to declare this in advance. The majority of Filipinos express exceptional affection and gratitude to the American people, without exception."

Shoulder-to-Shoulder Combat: Supreme Honor

"The United States has a great history and tradition, and we have been deeply influenced by it. After independence, the Filipinos will continue to strive to maintain friendly relations with the United States. We may not be able to maintain close political relations with the United States, but the friendly relations with various U.S. institutions and organizations will certainly remain unchanged. I sincerely hope that there will be no more wars in the future, but if, unfortunately, things do not go as we wish and the United States once again uses force to protect freedom and human rights, then I firmly believe that the Filipino people will fight shoulder-to-shoulder with the United States. Fighting alongside the United States is not only an honor, but also a responsibility to be undertaken."

### British Policy on Palestine Provokes Domestic Reaction; Jewish Secret Armory Uncovered in Haifa

[United Press London, 2nd] Since British troops arrested 2,718 Jews in Palestine last weekend, British parliamentarians have received a deluge of protest telegrams. Last night, hundreds of men and women in London's East End went to the House of Commons to protest the government's Palestine policy. British Prime Minister Attlee defended the British Palestine policy in the House of Commons in response to questions from Labour Party members. It is said that he hopes to resolve the Palestine issue in accordance with the recommendations of the Anglo-American Investigation Committee and is currently negotiating with the United States on ways to restore peace in Palestine. However, Britain will reject any peace plan that is unacceptable to all parties or that must be implemented by force. During the debate, committee representative Crossman declared that the government's policy would only result in us going to war first with the Jews and then with the Arabs. Only by implementing liberation can the resistance movement be eliminated. Liberal Party member Scheer said that the arrest of Jews last weekend was "obviously a siege of the Jewish homeland." The House of Commons adjourned without expressing its opinion on the government's Palestine policy.

[United Press Jerusalem, 1st] British military authorities announced today that an armory was discovered in the basement of a Jewish colony near Haifa.

### Atomic Bomb's Power Thus: Damage to Targets Less Than Expected; Second Test to be Held Within Four Weeks

[Agence France-Presse San Francisco, 2nd] Test Commander Lieutenant General Blandy announced today that the second atomic bomb test will be held within four weeks in the Bikini Lagoon. Underwater detonation will be used this time.

[United Press USS Appalachian, 2nd] According to predictions by Test Commander Blandy, it will take months to determine the results of the test. Although aircraft carriers and destroyers were damaged, they cannot be said to have reached their end. In the past, during the war against Japan, aircraft carriers and destroyers were sunk, but we did not stop building them because of this. Although the USS Independence was badly burned, there were U.S. ships that suffered even more damage from Japanese kamikaze attacks. Although many inspectors believe that this test was a major disappointment, the bombing damage was still quite astonishing. Even for warships that suffered less damage, if there were humans on board, the number of deaths and injuries from radiation would be incalculable.

Two Reasons for Lighter Damage

[Report from Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 2nd (Radio Broadcast): Scientists believe that the first reason for the lighter damage is that the targets were different. The second reason, according to Lieutenant General Blandy, who is in charge of this test, is probably that this bomb was not as powerful as the bomb that fell on Nagasaki.

Blandy's Broadcast After Inspection

[Reuters USS Appalachian, 1st] Lieutenant General Blandy confirmed that the atomic bomb fell on the stern of the USS Nevada and did not hit the bullseye. He told reporters today that the atomic bomb test was not as moving as the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor. The damage to the ships was far less than expected. During this test, the mushroom cloud rose to 35,000 feet, only half as high as the mushroom cloud that rose when Nagasaki was bombed, but it is not yet possible to determine whether the height of the mushroom cloud is related to the effectiveness of the bombing. Some of the pigs and sheep used for the test also did not die, but they were all far from the center of the explosion. Lieutenant General Blandy broadcast again after entering the coral reef for inspection: All of our personnel completed an excellent and accurate performance. The only casualty was an unmanned fighter jet controlled by radio, which lost control and fell into the sea before dropping the bomb. The remaining unmanned aircraft safely entered and exited the mushroom cloud and returned to base to await inspection. There is still radio wave activity on the sea surface around the atoll, so only a rough investigation can be carried out at present.

### Prices Rising in U.S.

[United Press Washington, 2nd] Prices have been rising since the Office of Price Administration legally ceased to exist at midnight on June 30th. According to the Department of Labor, the index of basic commodities increased from 177 to 206 in one day, 95 percent higher than in September 1939. Domestic agricultural products in the general price index increased to 285.3 in part. It has also been learned from various sources that rents in some areas have increased from 15 percent to 33.3 percent. Some states have taken emergency measures to freeze rents at the price administration's defined standards. The price of milk in Dallas and Texas rose by three and a half cents per quart, and by two cents in other areas. The Western Meat Packers Association announced that meat prices have increased by an average of 20 percent, and livestock prices are the highest since 1919, with Chicago cattle prices reaching $22 per hundred pounds.

### Far East International Tribunal: US Prosecutor Begins Arguments: Historical Facts of Japan's Invasion of China: Araki, Doihara, and Others Are the Ringleaders in This Case: The League of Nations Lytton Report Is Also Read Simultaneously

[Reconstruction Society Tokyo, 2nd] Yesterday, after questioning Gotō Fumio, the Far East International Tribunal changed its planned procedure. US Prosecutor Darcy proposed temporarily suspending the hearing of matters related to Japan's alteration of its politics and public opinion before the war and proceeding with the trial of Japan's armed aggression against China. He then presented an important argument regarding the armed invasion of Manchuria, stating: We wish to present here the entire picture of Japan's plan for Manchuria, its stimulation and execution of the war of aggression. Up to 1928, the rights Japan obtained from the war of aggression included: a 99-year lease of the Liaodong Peninsula, a 99-year lease of the South Manchurian Railway, the right to operate other railways in Manchuria, the right to establish settlements in Andong, Shenyang, and Yingkou, the priority right to employ special officials, the right to establish post offices and operate telegraph and telephone businesses, and priority rights concerning mines and forests. Of particular importance were the rights to station railways, consuls, and garrison troops, which allowed the concentration of large forces in Manchuria. With the emergence of the Tanaka cabinet in 1927, the Kwantung Army supported the government's so-called active policy towards Manchuria, meaning the extreme expansion of its rights throughout Manchuria and the maintenance of order. After May 1927, Japanese troops were dispatched to China in large numbers, planning to provoke incidents as a pretext for armed occupation, ultimately developing into the establishment of a puppet government that would obey Japan. The facts of this process are as follows:

The Mukden Incident

(1) On the night of September 18, 1931, the staff of the Tokyo and Kwantung Armies, army officers, and some officials and civilians created the Mukden Incident. (2) They occupied Jehol, Inner Mongolia, and Manchuria by force, establishing a puppet government, which was manipulated by the Kwantung Army and formally recognized in September 1932. (3) They ruled directly until September 1945. During this period, they used Manchuria as a base for invading neighboring Chinese areas. On the night of September 18, 1931, the conspirators detonated explosives near the "South Manchurian Railway" north of Shenyang and blamed it on China. Although the railway was damaged, the extent was minor and did not prevent trains from running soon after the explosion. To implement this plan, artillery had been brought from Japan earlier that year, prepared to seize the opportunity to attack the nearby Chinese barracks. As soon as the September 18th Incident occurred, the artillery immediately opened fire on the Chinese barracks. The Japanese troops in Manchuria took unified action from the next day. The Japanese troops stationed in Korea also crossed the Yalu River without authorization to participate in the action, which is the well-known border crossing incident. Before the League of Nations investigation team could reach a conclusion, Japan had completely occupied Manchuria. In March 1932, a puppet government headed by Puyi was established, entirely controlled by the Japanese army and with Japanese occupying more than half of the key positions. The Kwantung Army determined the government's personnel and policies. In terms of financial and economic policies, Japan and Manchukuo were regarded as "one economic entity."

The Puppet State of Manchukuo

When "Manchukuo" was recognized, the Kwantung Army issued instructions stating that "Manchukuo's" policies must be decided by the commander of the Kwantung Army, with the Japanese administering the government; Puyi was the nominal ruler, and Japan did not recognize his authority; no political groups were allowed to participate in politics. The puppet state of Manchukuo had the same status as Japan in terms of tariff barriers. Japan continued to decide on more radical new policies for the development of Manchuria year by year, implemented through the Kwantung Army. The governments and people of Inner Mongolia and Manhe did not respond or compromise at all. The Japanese army's invasion continued southwards across the Great Wall from Jehol. In 1933, the Tanggu Truce was signed, using the Great Wall as its northern boundary, and a neutral zone was established in northern Hebei Province. In 1935, General Umezu of Japan demanded that the Chinese government withdraw the Kuomintang forces in Hebei Province to central China and replace anti-Japanese Chinese officials. Japan spared no effort in promoting this policy in North China. Kwantung Army Commander General Minami, Tianjin Army Commander General Umezu, and Colonel Doihara were the vanguards of this movement. In order to strengthen and expand Japan's military and political power in China, they established a political government in North China,

Anti-Communist Autonomous Government of Eastern Hebei

Finally, the so-called "Anti-Communist Autonomous Government of Eastern Hebei" was established. In 1935, only a small part of Inner Mongolia did not cooperate with the puppet government of Manchuria. The Japanese garrison in Tianjin was repeatedly strengthened in reality. Japanese troops often caused many military incidents on the borders of Manchuria, Mongolia, and Siberia, using political and economic manipulation and control. In order to cope with this situation, the Chinese government established the Hebei-Chahar Political Council in December 1935, and strengthened the Mongolian Political Council in 1936. Under these circumstances, these places maintained a free policy towards the Chinese government. At the same time, the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia signed a mutual assistance alliance treaty, which greatly hindered the Mongolian autonomous government and led to the expansion of its policies to the west and south. Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact with Germany on November 25, 1936.

The July 7th Incident

The Lugouqiao Incident was triggered on July 7, 1937. These open actions completely violated international conventions. Treaties such as the Hague Convention, the Treaty of Versailles, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Treaty of Paris all clearly stipulated that international disputes should not be resolved by resorting to force. However, Japan's active military actions in Manchuria continued, but it still declared to the world that this was an action to show peace. When Japan began to occupy Manchuria in September 1931, it declared to the United States that it had no intention of occupying Northeast China and that it had no territorial ambitions towards China. However, on October 8 of the same year, Jinzhou was bombed, and on February 1, Qiqihar was occupied. On November 24, Japan informed the United States that the report of the Kwantung Army attacking northwest of Jinzhou was not true; but Jinzhou was occupied again the following January. On December 22, 1931, Japan declared to the United States that it would not infringe on Chinese sovereignty. Between that year and the following year, Japan made many statements to the League of Nations, but in February 1932, Harbin was seized, confirming the occupation of Manchuria and the establishment of a puppet regime. All of the above actions, we confirm based on the official reports of the Japanese government, the confessions of the defendants, the confessions of the conspirators, and the testimony of Japanese politicians and general officials at the time. We will present them in the indictment. The defendants who actively participated in this part were Araki Sadao, Doihara Kenji, Hashimoto Kingoro, Hirota Koki, Itagaki Seishiro, Matsuoka Yosuke, Minami Jiro, and Okawa Shumei.

### Zhang Zuolin Was Murdered by the Japanese Army: Okada Keisuke Has Confirmed It

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd] Zhang Zuolin was murdered by the Japanese army. This afternoon, in the war crimes trial court, it has been confirmed by former Japanese Prime Minister and Navy Minister Okada Keisuke, who testified that it was indeed murdered by the Japanese army. It was also part of the Kwantung Army's conspiracy to annex Manchuria.

[Associated Press, 2nd] The International Tribunal continued to try Japanese war criminals today. Former Foreign Minister Okada appeared in court to testify. He stated that regarding Japan's expansion into Manchuria due to "overpopulation," he had heard that a "gentleman's agreement" had been reached between Japan and the United States, which had been "tacitly approved." Chief Justice Webb said that Okada's words had "shocked" the entire court. Okada served as Japanese Prime Minister from 1934 to 1936 and was an anti-militarist. Tojo's defense lawyer Kiyose Ichiro questioned Okada about the Tanaka Memorial. Okada replied that when Tanaka was Prime Minister from 1927 to 1929, Japan was overpopulated and could not develop towards the United States due to the restrictions imposed by the United States in 1924 on the migration of Far Eastern people to the United States. Therefore, he decided to use Manchuria as a destination for immigrants. Tanaka originally intended to implement his plan for "gradual" peaceful immigration to Manchuria, but radical young officers, contrary to the wishes of the Emperor and the government, ultimately plunged Japan into a state of war. Kiyose immediately asked whether the Tanaka plan he mentioned referred to the Tanaka Memorial. Okada replied that he had never seen this memorial and firmly believed that there was no such memorial. In his first testimony, Okada stated that he had served as Navy Minister in two cabinets, and had also served as a top military advisor and Prime Minister. Therefore, in terms of his position, he knew very well about all the issues in Japan at that time and the events that occurred. After Manchuria was occupied by Japan, the Kwantung Army headquarters actually became the Manchurian government. He had opposed the invasion plan, and as a result, he was assassinated in February 1936. The cabinet he led was finally forced to resign the following year.

Kido's Diary

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 2nd] The International Military Tribunal continued to try Japanese war criminals this morning. The prosecutor presented the diary of Kido Koichi, a close advisor to the Emperor, which was 115 pages long and revealed detailed inside stories of Japan's 15-year history of aggression. The defense lawyer protested, saying that the prosecutor's two translations of Kido's diary were completely different. Chief Justice Webb said: This contradiction in the translation shows the weakness of the prosecutor's side, and the defendant will naturally take advantage of it. According to the defendant's lawyer, the document was very long, and before receiving the new translation submitted by the prosecutor, they had not been able to read it completely. Therefore, they had to start preparing again to defend against the points recorded in Kido's diary. After an hour of debate between the two sides, the prosecutor read out the League of Nations Lytton Commission Report on the "Manchurian Incident." The prosecutor presented documents proving that three years before the September 18th Incident, on May 8, 1928, Japan had formally warned the Chinese government that if it could not maintain domestic peace, Japan would take tough steps, but guaranteed to act cautiously so as not to cause any unfair results. The Japanese side had protested to China, saying that foreigners were greatly disturbed by the "extremely unstable" situation and that a remedy must be found immediately. It also stated that the Tokyo government feared that the "Manchurian security" would be threatened and might have to take appropriate and effective steps to maintain order.

### Qin Dechun Will Testify on the 8th

[Central News Agency Tokyo, 2nd Special Dispatch] The Far East International Tribunal today decided to invite General Qin Dechun, the newly appointed Vice Minister of National Defense of our country, to testify on the 8th against the 27 major Japanese war suspects in order to allow Mr. Qin to return to China as soon as possible, as the Chinese government currently urgently needs General Qin to return to the country.

### The Municipal Government Convened a Meeting of Representatives from Various Agencies and Grain Organizations Yesterday: A Food Conference Was Held: The Authorities Have Made Major Decisions: There Will Be No Panic in July and August

[Report from Our Newspaper] The most serious food problem currently facing the city, after meetings between Premier Song of the Executive Yuan, Minister Xu of the Food Ministry, and Wu Nanchang, has resulted in major decisions. Mayor Wu specially convened a food conference at the City Hall meeting room at 5 PM yesterday. Attendees included He Fuji, Director of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry; Zhang DeKui, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau; Wu Kaixian, Director of the Central Bank Office; Chen Hang, President of the Bank of China's Foreign Trade Department; Chen Changtong, Manager of the China Textile Company (representing Zhang Zhaoji); Jiang Hanluo, Manager of the China Food Industry Company; Jiang Zhenhua of the Rice Industry Trade Association; Wan Lin; Chen Shaolian; Chang; Xing Zhigang, Yi Yisheng, and Zhu Chengming of the Bean and Rice Industry Trade Association; and Cha Shisan of the Consignment Rice Industry Trade Association, among others. Mayor Wu presided over the meeting and first reported on the results of the discussions with Premier Song and Minister Xu, and then put forward specific opinions. The Director of the Social Affairs and Industry Bureau explained in detail the allocation of rice and the review of price methods. Afterwards, Xing Zhigang of the Consignment Rice Industry Trade Association and Jiang Zhenhua of the Rice Industry Trade Association successively stated the current difficulties of the rice industry, and asked the government to protect the legitimate profits of normal rice merchants. After detailed discussion, concrete decisions were made.

At 6 PM, Mayor Wu convened a press conference in the City Hall meeting room. First, Mayor Wu reported on the progress of the food conference, stating: After discussions with Premier Song and Minister Xu, it was believed that there would be no panic regarding food in the city within July and August. The current high rice prices and the emergence of black markets are purely because people in Shanghai love to eat white rice. In fact, brown rice is cheaper and more nutritious. In this time of disaster, he hoped that citizens would eat more brown rice. The food conference unanimously agreed that to solve the city's food problem, in addition to unblocking the flow of rice into Shanghai, it was also necessary to strictly crack down on black markets. Two concrete measures have been decided: (1) The worrying price of rice is limited to 46,000 yuan per dan (approximately 50 kg), and lower quality rice must be reduced in price. The Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau will directly allocate it to various rice shops. After adding transportation costs and the deserved profit, the selling price will be approximately 51,000 yuan per dan. It is stipulated that each rice shop must mark the prices of various types of rice, and the Social Affairs Bureau will send personnel to check secretly at any time. Citizens are also welcome to report any violations at any time. (2) Rice merchants are allowed to purchase white rice. However, its price is not included in the limited price and will be decided by the Food Price Review Committee organized by the Food Ministry, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Bean and Rice Industry Trade Association. In the future, if the price of white rice is expensive and the brown rice with limited price can be supplied continuously, the black market can be eliminated by itself. Finally, Mayor Wu euphemistically said: Rice and grain are indeed more difficult to obtain in July and August, but the City Government now has solutions. Today, a large amount of Jiangxi rice has been shipped to Shanghai, and it will start to be sold soon. After the new rice comes on the market in mid-September, the city's food situation will definitely not be a problem.

The Joint Relief Transportation Totals Over 6,000 Tons to Shanghai

According to the spokesman of the Executive Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) speaking to reporters, from April to mid-June this year, UNRRA has transported 30,080 tons of rice to China, of which 23,400 tons arrived at Yuanlong Port and 6,680 tons arrived in Shanghai. Among the above-mentioned rice, 8,210 tons were donated by overseas Chinese in Thailand to the disaster-stricken compatriots in the motherland. According to recent news, a large amount of rice will continue to flow in from overseas in the short term.

### Tomita Toku, a War Criminal Who Massacred Our Patriots, Was Indicted Yesterday

According to the Shanghai Military Court, Tomita Toku (28 years old, from Aichi Prefecture), a former sergeant of the Shenyang Japanese Garrison, was indicted yesterday on suspicion of intentionally murdering under Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law after an investigation by the court. The origin of the trial was that Di Weicheng, a graduate of the fifth class of Huangpu, served as the chief of staff of the 6th detachment of the Zhongyi National Salvation Army in the spring of 1945, and was later transferred to the headquarters of the Zhongyi National Salvation Army as a colonel instructor. He was sent to Piaoyang to instigate the defection of the puppet army, but was detected by enemy agent Ma Lixing, who informed the Japanese side. The defendant, Tomita Toku, then a sergeant of the Piaoyang Japanese Gendarmerie, learned of this and led many Japanese gendarmes on March 26, 1945, to arrest Di and widely arrest the staff who went to Piaoyang with Di. After Di was arrested, he was unyielding and refused to confess. He was resented by the defendant, who led six soldiers on the evening of June 4 last year to tie Di's eyes and lower jaw with grass and tightly bind his mouth with cloth to prevent him from making a sound. Then, he repeatedly lifted him up and slammed him to the ground until he died. Then, he put him in a straw bag and used a fishing boat to transport him to the wasteland of Sanguangzhu on the opposite bank of Piaoyang. He dug a hole to take out the body. Because the hole was too small to fit the body, he first cut off Di's head with a bayonet, then cut off his hands and feet, and then slashed his waist. Later, Di Fangdexian, the brother of the deceased, heard about it and asked someone to intercede to dig out the body for burial. The body was covered with mud and was unbearable to look at, but the defendant still did not allow Di to be buried and drove him away with a gun. After the Japanese army surrendered, Di reported the case to the War Prisoner Administration of this city to arrest Tomita Toku for trial.

### The Rong Desheng Kidnapping Case: The Investigation Process Will Be Announced: The Mastermind Will Definitely Be Unexpected: Part of the Ransom Money in US Dollars Has Been Recovered

[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the kidnapping of cotton yarn and flour tycoon Rong Desheng occurred, all parties have paid great attention. There has been much speculation and conjecture about the inside story of the case. It is learned that since the case was solved by the Songhu Garrison Command, it is under strict investigation. The commander Xuan will personally invite the press to announce the process of solving the case soon. The reason why the police kept the matter secret during the investigation was that the internal situation was complicated and one or two details had not been completed. They were deeply afraid that the publication of the newspaper would affect the overall situation. Now, with the hard work of the capable personnel of the Ministry, the truth is about to come to light. Approximately 400,000 US dollars of the ransom paid to the kidnappers by the Le family has also been recovered, and the police will return all of it to the Rong family. As for who the mastermind of the Rong case is, it is believed that the announcement will definitely be unexpected.

Foreign Ships Attempt to Continue Manipulating China's Navigation Rights Under the Names of Chinese Businesses

Opinions expressed by Navigation Industry Leaders

Byers is only the shoulder of Bertola, Bertola is tall and has long hands, and his effective serve is the main reason for his victory. Although today's game was tense, it was not exciting. Byers made many mistakes and was often drawn to the网 by the opponent, and was subdued by the French player's powerful backhand.

Civil Affairs Briefing on Baoding and Jia Zhang Xiaosong

Our organization of Baoding and Jia in Shanghai is based on the city organization law. At the beginning of the organization, a few people opposed it, and to this day, a few people still have doubts about the Baoding and Jia system. This is due to a lack of understanding of the content of the current Baoding and Jia system. The reasons for their doubts can be summarized into four points:

First: They believe that during the period when Shanghai was occupied, the enemy and puppet organized Baoding and Jia to monitor our patriotic activities and levy materials for the enemy's use. Therefore, Baoding and Jia is a legacy of the enemy and puppet. We should not do the same as the enemy and puppet and organize Baoding and Jia after the victory; however, they admit that the enemy and puppet's use of Baoding and Jia in Shanghai did have an effect on public security.

Second: They believe that the Baoding and Jia system does not exist in foreign countries. Since foreign countries do not have it, why should we set it up? An article in a foreign newspaper said: "If the Baoding and Jia system were proposed in the US Congress, there would be no room for discussion." Another Chinese newspaper said: "Cars drive on the right, and there are such rules in foreign countries, so we approve of it. There is no Baoding and Jia in foreign countries, so we do not approve of it."

Third: They admit that Baoding and Jia is a Chinese state-owned system, but they are worried that this system is a tool for monitoring the people,剥削 freedom, and anti-democracy, such as Shang Gong during the Qin Xiaogong era, which is an example of self-inflicted harm.

Fourth: They believe that it is appropriate to use Baoding and Jia in the provinces and counties of the interior, but there are still doubts about whether the Baoding and Jia system should be used in the industrial and commercial society of Shanghai.

I will now explain the above four doubts and explain the content of the current Baoding and Jia system.

First: Baoding and Jia is our country's inherent system, which has been practiced for a long time. After Taiwan was ceded to Japan, the Japanese used the Baoding and Jia system to control Taiwan. Therefore, the Japanese plagiarized our Baoding and Jia organization, not just starting in Shanghai during the occupation, and the Baoding and Jia system they implemented in Taiwan and Shanghai, its method and essence, are different from our current Baoding and Jia, that is, different from our past ones.

Second: Social science is different from natural science. For example, the United States invented the atomic bomb and dropped it on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan, causing destructive power. If it were dropped on London in the United Kingdom or Marseilles in France, it would also cause destructive power; The movie invented by Edison can see various colors and movements on the screen in the United States, and what is seen on the screen in China is the same. When it comes to social science, it is different. Whether it is law, education, or political system, it is necessary to formulate its articles and systems according to the national culture, living habits, and traditional spirit of each country, and cannot blindly learn the methods of other countries, cutting off one's feet to fit the shoes, and messing up the system. If we forget that we are Chinese, forget that our motherland has a traditional good law and excellent system that suits the national conditions, and think that what the United States and Britain do not have is not good, and that what the United States and Britain have is all good, then, to put it nicely, our country's name is not called the Republic of China, but becomes the Republic of China and the United States or the Republic of China and Britain, so the second kind of skeptical view is really unreasonable.

The third type of doubt, they admit that Baoding and Jia is something inherent in China, but they only understand half of it and have not studied the entire current Baoding and Jia system. It must be known that since the promulgation of the new county system in the 28th year of the Republic of China, the Baoding and Jia system has been changed from a passive focus on the nature of prevention to a progressive democratic spirit; such as the 甲设户长会议, 保设保民大大会, not only is the 保甲长 elected by this meeting, but also the 保甲长 can be dismissed. It is not only to suggest matters related to the entire Bao and Jia that should be done and should be abolished, but also to supervise the execution of the 保甲长. If the 保甲长 has illegal acts that violate the people, the household head meeting and the 保民大会 can take him to复决 or dismiss him, how can the 保甲长 be willful and arbitrarily市民? Moreover, it is necessary to understand that the Baoding and Jia system is a kind of organization for implementing local autonomy. It cannot interfere at all with the citizens' beliefs in religion and doctrines. Therefore, the 保甲长 not only cannot influence whether citizens participate or not in the legal activities of the party, but also has no right to interfere. Therefore, you can rest assured that the Baoding and Jia system will not be anti-democratic, nor will it be a tool for the people.

Fourth: We are going to talk about whether the Baoding and Jia system should be implemented in the city area in the same way as in the provinces and counties. Since ancient times, our country has talked about local autonomy systems, no more than village and neighborhood systems, 坊 　systems and township 　systems. Taking Shanghai as an example, Shanghai is an industrial and commercial city, and it is a gateway to information. The social situation is of course different from the countryside. However, we study, and take Kielter's industrial group system as the grassroots organization of autonomy? The views of工　master are

Spring and Autumn Sentiments – by Uncle Sun Ruying

Sometimes, I am very happy and find everything delightful. Upon seeing good friends, I smile and say, "I've been in a great mood lately!" But other times, I suddenly feel pessimistic and have no interest in life. When I meet acquaintances, I can't help but complain dejectedly, "Alas, I've been in such a bad mood lately!"

I don't understand whether I am allowing my mood to dictate my life or letting life control my mood. However, I am certain that there is a close interrelationship between them. When I am free from worries about food and clothing and at ease, I can still have melancholy feelings. Even when I am struggling, fighting hard, and even bleeding amidst difficulties, I may still remain optimistic. Therefore, I believe that what governs my mood is not solely external factors, meaning not just the environment I am in.

Based on my intuition, I believe that what governs my mood is a combined force of my mental state and the environment I am in. The decision of my mood comes from both my individuality and the external environment. When my heart is comfortable with the environment, or when I tame the environment, or when I am not afraid of the environment, I am courageous, optimistic, and in a good mood. When my heart feels suffocated in the environment, unable to change it, and unable to conform to it, then I am in pain. I pull my hair and beat my chest, and then I am in pain, and my mood is bad and melancholy.

Mood is truly like the weather, impermanent and changeable. Doesn't it sometimes rain and sometimes shine? Our moods also have sunny and cloudy days. On the sunny days of your mood, you are faithful to life, exert the power of your life, and do what you want to do and what you think is worth doing. On the rainy days of your mood, you do nothing, you waste your life, your youth, you watch the sun rise and set, and you just feel disillusioned, empty, and eternally infinitely painful. In our lifetime, can you calculate how many good mood days and bad mood days you have?

In any case, for a person, good mood days are a great pleasure. To the extent that living a life in a good mood is the purpose of life. If we can only have thirty years of good mood days in sixty years of life, then I will be satisfied with living for only thirty years. Bad mood days are much more painful than death. However, we still often get trapped in the distress of bad moods. We endure this pain without complaint and without an end. Moreover, for most people, this pain far outweighs the joy they can have.

Instead of trying to obtain the secret to longevity, we would rather look for ways to make our moods happy. Qin Shi Huang was a fool, precisely because he did not know how to find a happy mood. Emperor Tang Ming was extremely intelligent; he had joy, he had a happy mood.

Therefore, I advise you to find ways to create happy moods. Let me tell you—

Train a strong will, cultivate a mind good at aesthetics, handle your environment with your greatest confidence, and dissolve the misfortunes you encounter with your greatest tolerance. Combine your memories with a happy mood, so that even if life is short, you can be considered to have lived a worthwhile life.

### The Warrior - Starting with Mr. Zhao Jingshen – By Pan Ren

### Wandering in the Pool - By Zhao Jing Shen

After reading Mr. Zhao Jingshen's "A Brief Discussion on Chinese Female Novelists," it stirred up my nostalgia for Mr. Zhao and some new feelings.

Sixteen years ago, when I was studying at Lida Academy in Jiangwan, Mr. Zhao was my teacher. However, my motivation for writing this article is not to boast about our teacher-student relationship but because Mr. Zhao's views on literature once gave me an inspiration. Even today, sixteen years later, his attitude towards creation is still the same, giving me a kind of tacit understanding.

When the short story collection "Who is the Happy One" was published in 1929, Mr. Zhao wrote a preface for it. In the preface, there was roughly a passage that said: "I like reading the article 'What's the Problem?' Firstly, because it is a true reflection of student life... Secondly, perhaps because it is the author's most genuine experience... I hope I can often see works like 'What's the Problem?'"

Today, Mr. Zhao says about Ms. Luo Hong's novels in "A Brief Discussion": "Luo Hong's writing seems to have evolved from restraint to freedom, from meticulous brushwork to freehand, and from piling up words to plain description. To be honest, there was a brief period when I didn't like her novels, namely those restrained, meticulously crafted, and piled-up ones..."

Mr. Zhao is the most amiable person. His speech and writing are like his temperament, always gentle and never excessive. However, from the above two passages, we can also see Mr. Zhao's stance on literary writing. He advocates—although he himself did not say so—realism, freehand, plain description, and freedom. He opposes those meticulous, piled-up, restrained, and chaotic works, even those sentimental writings that moan without illness are no exception.

This may be my speculation or misinterpretation of Mr. Zhao's literary writing stance. However, I do feel that Mr. Zhao has given me this kind of inspiration, leading to today's tacit understanding. This understanding has aroused the feelings I want to express below.

Perhaps due to our country's traditional values, many people have been poisoned by the phrase "excel in learning and then become an official." At the same time, many people view the scope of knowledge too narrowly, equating "learning" with "literature." They believe that being able to write articles is having "knowledge," just like in the imperial examination era, where being able to write good "eight-legged essays" could lead to becoming a top scholar and a high-ranking official.

Therefore, there are many young people in middle schools who love to learn literary writing, and the number of students who enter the literature department of the liberal arts college in universities also accounts for an absolute majority.

Logically, with so many knowledgeable young people engaged in literature in China, and with the New Literature Movement in China having a history of many years, the Chinese literary scene should be blooming with numerous exotic flowers and rare herbs.

However, just based on my personal understanding of literature for more than ten years, the famous names in the literary world are still those familiar ones. If it is attributed to the publishing industry's inability to support emerging talents, I still believe that there is a reason for the lack of progress among those engaged in literature.

I have also been a Chinese language teacher for several years. I admire the enthusiasm of young people engaged in literary writing, but their works are so poor and empty that reading them gives me a feeling of "not knowing what they are talking about." Either they are baseless fabrications or moans without illness. The outward form is very "literary," with every sentence being carved and piled up. If you ask them what their article wants to express, they will be at a loss for an answer. I sometimes tell them, "This kind of article is like a plaster beauty—good-looking but useless." I feel not sympathy but repulsion towards their criticisms.

I have also read many literary publications, and what the editors record and publish is mostly the kind of articles mentioned in the previous paragraph. I then realized that most young people engaged in literary writing are influenced by this kind of infectious style.

Anyone who has read literary history knows that there are many schools of thought in literature, but this article is not discussing the problem of literary schools, nor is it necessary to "cite classics and allusions." It is just writing some personal feelings about literature. At least I believe that literary creations that "lack substance" and are "empty in appearance" are not to be learned, written, or desired, especially in today's turbulent society and among people in their dreams. We must awaken them, we must write about its ugliness, and we must recognize the great power of literature. We must not regard it as "fleeting comfort" for people to pass the time after tea and wine.

I agree with Mr. Zhao Jingshen's literary writing stance. When we write works, we should be realistic, use plain descriptions... and make it like Bai Juyi's poems: "Even old women can understand."

### Long Serial Novel - Flying Together (73) - By Zhao Qingge

"What? Xiao Hua!" Madam Mo exclaimed in surprise. "You want to stop singing so early? Do you plan to stop your mother from living?"

Madam Mo never dreamed that Lihua would say such a thing to her! For years, Lihua had obediently studied opera and then performed on stage, never complaining. This made Madam Mo mistakenly believe that Lihua, like her, had great expectations for her art. Who knew that today, Lihua suddenly wanted to stop singing? Madam Mo felt as if a bolt from the blue had struck! She was angry, angry at Lihua for being inconsiderate, but she didn't dare to scold her too much because Madam Mo knew Lihua's temper. If she provoked her, she might really quit singing. Therefore, Madam Mo had no choice but to use emotional words to move Lihua. She knew that Lihua was a filial child. Perhaps this was the weakness of Lihua that Madam Mo had grasped.

"My child! Mother has spent all her savings to cultivate you! If you stop singing now, wouldn't that take Mother's life?" Madam Mo said, her nose becoming congested.

"I'm not referring to now. I want to sing for another two or three years and then stop," Lihua said specifically, stating her opinion.

"That will also have to wait until your reputation is greater and your finances are more comfortable before you can talk about not singing. It's still too early now. Why are you thinking about these things?" Madam Mo said, resuming her previous argument.

Lihua said nothing more! This unsuccessful conversation only added to her worries. She could only return to her previous thoughts: forget herself, forget her own interests; only for Madam Mo; for Madam Mo's benefit; keep singing, keep singing!

### The Struggle of Theories - By Fu Tongxian

Why do humans have thoughts, and why do they systematically organize thoughts to form theories? We are not rationalists who believe that humans are born with thoughts. We believe that thoughts are the symbolization and idealization of human behavior. In the process of life, humans must constantly take actions to meet their needs. Other animals do the same. Because they can only use slow and clumsy behaviors to satisfy their desires, they can only remain in a primitive and savage state. The reason why human life can progress and the reason why humans have culture is that human behavior has been symbolized and idealized. In many places, we use thoughts to represent behavior, which allows us to avoid many unnecessary actions and allows our needs to be met more economically and quickly. When these thoughts are systematically organized into theories, they can guide our actions towards more meaningful goals. Therefore, theory is the crystallization of behavior and also the guide of behavior.

Action is like walking on the ground, and thought is like traveling by airplane. An airplane takes off from the ground. It not only takes us faster but also makes us see the path on the ground very clearly, and the direction of progress is also very clear. But we don't take an airplane to float in the sky permanently; we also want to make it land at our destination. Therefore, although theory is the abstraction of behavior, it must still be able to practically guide behavior and be practically applied to behavior.

Since humans have had thoughts, their needs have also become more complex. Some behaviors are driven by desires. These desires are more inclined towards physiological needs. They are blind and based on the survival and prosperity of the individual, so they are relatively selfish. Some behaviors are driven by thoughtful theories. The driving force of this kind of behavior is more inclined towards social needs. They are rational and based on the survival and prosperity of the group, so they are relatively focused on common welfare. I say relatively focused on common welfare, which means that some theories guide behavior with a focus on smaller groups, while others focus on larger groups. The more a theory focuses on the interests of the individual, the easier it is for people to accept and implement. The more a theory focuses on the common welfare of larger groups, the more difficult it is for people to accept and implement.

Therefore, there are conflicts between behavior and theory, and there are also conflicts between theories. The reason for this conflict may be due to the disconnection between theory and behavior or the contradiction between selfish desires and public welfare. For example, some people have no theory at all and only have behavior. This kind of person's behavior is blind and superstitious. Of course, this is not without choice, but the standard they choose is "to suit their desires." In other words, they listen to the promotion of selfish desires. The best result is just a good machine. The second type of person is one who has a theory but it does not play a role in action. That is to say, theory is theory, and behavior is behavior, and the two are not related. At this time, the theory is just a guise, a hollow form, and the actual behavior is still driven by selfish desires. Otherwise, the theory is too far beyond actual life, and behavior cannot follow the theory. The former is an error in behavior, and the latter is an error in theory. The third type of person is one who talks about one theory but whose actual behavior is based on another theory. The reason for this phenomenon may be that the theory talked about does not conform to actual life and must continue to be talked about. When secretly implementing it, they have to find another set of theories. Only those inside the circle know this and it cannot be expressed to outsiders. Or it may be that the theory talked about is actually needed by the public at the moment, but the person who implements it is unwilling to give up their own selfish desires. Thus, they have to establish two sets of theories.

But in these many conflicts and contradictions, one cannot but affirm what is right and deny what is wrong. Thus, the struggle of theories arises. The goal of the struggle of theories is originally to establish a sound and realistic theory in order to use this theory to guide behavior so that it can better enhance common welfare. However, the current struggle of theories often degenerates into partisanship and suppression of dissent. Some people even argue for the sake of arguing. As a result, they fall into several logical errors. I hope that gentlemen engaged in the struggle of theories will pay attention.

The first and most popular logical error now is "appealing to the masses." They believe that any argument that is approved by the public is the truth. Therefore, when two parties are in dispute, some people do not hesitate to mobilize larger and more organized masses to support the situation, and prove their theory with the applause of the audience. We do not oppose popularizing the truth, but we must not forget that Jesus was nailed to the cross by the masses. When scientists first said that the earth revolves around the sun, the masses were alarmed, doubted, and refused to believe it. When the United States first operated trains, the local people tried their best to obstruct and sabotage them. Why? The masses are often bound by their current interests, while general leaders should have insight, foresight, and vision. They should not only cater to the temporary support of the masses but also abandon their prophetic vision that they see more clearly than the masses. On the one hand, we must adapt to their needs, and on the other hand, we must awaken them to a higher awareness. If only the needs of the masses are the standard of truth, then all the yellow publications in Shanghai should have their highest value of existence.

The second popular mistake is "dismissing words because of the person" and "randomly citing authority." "Dismissing words because of the person" means that everything said by the people I believe in is completely right, and everything said by the people I don't believe in is completely wrong. Whether it is right or wrong depends on the theory itself, and one cannot dismiss words because of the person. Religious people are most likely to make this mistake. Everything said in the Bible is absolute truth. If I want to prove that my theory is right, I just need to quote a passage from the Bible. Current political theorists also often make this mistake. But we must know that a quote from a famous work cannot prove that my words are the truth. "Randomly citing authority" is an extension of "dismissing words because of the person." I believe in someone. Maybe he has expertise in Chinese studies, but because I believe in him, I will consult him on political, economic, and social issues, and quote his words to prove my words. This is wrong. Because someone is assumed to be an authority in this area, but in another area, he may be an amateur. How can we use him as a panacea!

The third popular logical error is "using the other party's wrong to prove one's own right." That is to say, when I am in a dispute with the other party, I try my best to expose the other party's shortcomings and criticize them completely, and then smugly think that I have won. But we must know that the other party's wrong does not equal my own right. I should actively put forward my own theory and come up with my own positive contributions to fight for my own position. Theoretically speaking, even if we prove the other party's wrong, this cannot prove one's own right. Destructive theorists should also do some constructive work! Conversely, some people have nothing to establish themselves, or what they have established has places that should be criticized and are afraid of others' attacks, which should also be reflected on, because as long as it is real gold, it is not afraid of fire.

### The Future of America - American Independence Day

### Special Compilation by the Newsroom of This Newspaper

July 4th is American Independence Day. Since the Declaration of Independence first revealed the ideals of "human survival, freedom, and the pursuit of happiness," the United States has been leading its people with vigorous energy toward this lofty goal. Especially during this war, the United States became the arsenal of democratic countries, defeating Germany in the West and subduing Japan in the East. Its leading position in terms of military power, human resources, material resources, and financial resources is undeniable. But spiritually, will the United States also lead the world toward the "pursuit of survival, freedom, and happiness"? And how will it lead? The people of the world have deep hopes and high expectations. The following article is a Canadian writer's hope and advice for the United States. It is specially translated and published on the occasion of American Independence Day, which should be what all readers who care about the future of the United States hope to read.

If a Roman from the fifth century could crawl out of his grave today and take a look at Washington, he would be very surprised. The situation in the American capital is so similar to the scene on the eve of the Roman Empire's decline: wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few people, various complex problems are emerging everywhere, and people are immersed in the pleasures of luxury. All this is very similar to the society on the eve of the Roman Empire's demise. But Washington cannot represent the entire United States, because on the other hand, we also see that everything is just beginning, and a new force is growing. And human civilization is going to rely on this new force.

Humans can live like humans instead of like beasts, all because of a kind of "human civilization." This civilization originated in Greece, spread to Rome, was messed up by the Romans, completely disappeared underground in the Middle Ages, and then appeared in England, and then followed the immigrants to America. The torch lit in Athens is now in the hands of the Americans. This is the most important political historical fact of our time.

Although the responsibility of the Americans in this matter is great, in fact, this is just a traditional belief of the United States. Simply put, this is the right to human survival, freedom, and the pursuit of happiness advocated by the ancestors who created the United States. We see that Americans are adjusting their political institutions, economic organizations, and inner thoughts to adapt to this new responsibility. Since the invention of the atomic bomb, Americans have felt even more keenly the importance of their responsibility. Should the world live in peace, or should the atomic bomb destroy everything? If we want to live in peace, it is almost impossible to lack American leadership. Its military strength, economic wealth, industrial technology, and especially its political ideas, all qualify it for this.

It has the qualifications, but the question is, can it apply them? And for what kind of goals will it apply them?

This is very important. Obviously, the United States can take two paths: it can take the path that other powerful empires have taken in the past, which is to rule the world and occupy it for itself. It can also take a completely different path, which is to do its best for the world and save the world, and at the same time, do its best for itself and save itself. Even if the United States takes the second path, there is still a question of what kind of moral standards it should have? Because the highest expression of human nature is not political or economic achievements but the expression of moral standards.

What is the current situation? The original political principles of the United States were inseparable from a deep religious belief and the moral standards of individual life. But in recent centuries, the most dangerous thing has happened. The "pursuit of happiness" that the founding fathers spoke of has been completely distorted. What they pursue is no longer an inner happiness but a sensory enjoyment, luxury, waste, and material pleasure. At present, the main driving force of American life and politics seems to be just creating more things, thinking that this will create better people. The idea spread by every successful politician and entrepreneur is that as long as enough goods are produced and distributed, all human problems will be solved. The huge number of national income has become the measure of the nation's psychological strength. The pursuit of truth has become the pursuit of new-style bathtubs, just like the nobles of the Roman era. Gold is worshipped, just like the gods of the Roman era.

Is this the philosophy and way of life that the United States is preparing to spread to the world?

Are the lofty political ideals of the United States in the past just a flash in the pan?

The standard of living is just the beginning of the standard of life. Material prosperity is only truly useful if it can cultivate spiritual happiness. But past history shows that once material prosperity begins, this spiritual happiness also begins to disappear.

Therefore, the future problems of the United States are not in those political, economic, or international issues that are currently being debated but only in the path of the American people's way of life. The main question is whether the American people can maintain the integrity of the previous era of life without being led astray by the intoxication of material enjoyment. If so, then the United States will not embark on the path of destruction, and the world will also lead to peace, stability, and happiness. But the answer to this question cannot be found in Washington. It must be found in the lives of the American people.

### New Light - Comparable to the Sun

New York, Western Union Telegraph Agency – Recently, the Western Union Telegraph Agency in New York conducted an experiment and found a tiny spot of light whose luminosity is equal to one-sixteenth of the sun's luminosity, and this luminosity can quickly develop to half of the sun's luminosity. This tiny spot of light is emitted from a molten metal crater only three-thousandths of an inch in diameter. All the instruments are only as large as the smallest vacuum tube in a receiver, and the intensity of the emitted light is so strong that the darkest glasses must be worn to look at it directly.

This extremely high luminosity may solve the difficulties in optical microscope research, determine new standards for movie brightness, and make photo enlargements clearer. The inventor calls it the "condensed arc lamp." Ordinary artificial light is generated by heating filaments, arcs, or combustion of easily flammable substances in a vacuum, but this "condensation" acts as a generator. The generating power of ordinary light sources is limited by the melting point of metal wires or other substances. But this new light, when the illuminant—zirconium—emits light, makes it continue to be digitized, thereby increasing its luminosity.

The discoverers used this new light for various experiments. The first experiment shone this light in a 40-foot-wide room, allowing objects to pass through this light and project onto a screen. As a result, the outer edge of the light was medically paroled without jagged edges. The second was photographic magnification. Half of the photo was enlarged using ordinary methods, and half was enlarged using this new light. As a result, the back half of the enlarged photo was extremely clear, and even every leaf on the tree could be counted.

According to the engineer in charge of this experiment, the light emitted by this new lamp is ten times brighter than ordinary tungsten incandescent lamps, i.e., 65,000 candlepower per square foot. Using these new lamps to project movies can reduce power consumption and make the image clearer. Therefore, it will definitely make a great contribution to television broadcasting in the future. In addition, using this condensed light wire of the zirconium lamp can also increase the magnification of the microscope.

The basic structure of this new lamp is two inductive electrode devices installed in a glass bulb. After the air is evacuated, inert gases such as argon are introduced. One end of the electrode is coated with a small amount of zirconium oxide. After the power is turned on, the zirconium melts and emits light. As the temperature increases, the amount of light also increases. This lamp generates less heat, but the amount of light is greater. The part of electrical energy converted into light is more than the part converted into heat. Therefore, this lamp uses less electricity and has strong light. In addition, the application of this light wire to optical work can reduce the shortcomings of lenses and increase light transmission and magnification. The invention of this new light will add a unique brilliance to the future optical world.

### The United States is Prepared to Deal with Bacterial Warfare - Translated from Collier's Magazine by Jia Nan

According to newspaper reports, the United States has discovered a white and sharp bacterial crystal that is extremely toxic, and every ounce can kill 200 million people. If the truth is indeed so, then the atomic bomb, which is second to none in modern military equipment, will have to give way!

The June 15th issue of "Collier's" magazine contained an article about "bacterial warfare." The author, Xia Leide, constructed an extremely terrible imaginary picture of this new war. Now, I will abridge the main points below:

Suppose that on the morning of December 5, 1958, an American named Smith suddenly died in a New York hospital. The situation before his death was very painful. He coughed up a lot of blood in his cough. The doctor diagnosed him as suffering from the "Black Death," which was extremely widespread and killed countless people in the 14th century. But the United States has not had this disease for fifteen years. This really stunned American medical scientists!

Suppose again that during this period, the international situation has undergone drastic changes. The envoys of the new Axis countries have just returned home because negotiations with the State Department have become deadlocked. Some observers believe that war may break out at any time, and the enemy country will launch an attack with weapons such as atomic rockets. Other observers believe that this is impossible because no country can use radioactive materials for war under the strict supervision of the United Nations.

On that day, another person in New York died of the Black Death, and patients in various hospitals were found to have symptoms of the Black Death. The next day, six more people died inexplicably, and similar bad news came from Miami, San Francisco, and Detroit.

In an instant, all kinds of epidemics broke out in the United States, coming on fiercely. Workers in the underground laboratories and arsenals built by the government at a cost of 100 million US dollars under the New Mexico desert were falling ill with dangerous infectious diseases.

If this really happened in 1958, it would mean that the Third World War has already begun. The development of the situation exceeded the expectations of ordinary military experts. It turned out that the first thing to come out and dedicate itself was not the atomic bomb but bacterial warfare.

The enemy does not need atomic bombs. When the offensive lands on the two coasts of the United States on the seventh day after the war, they will find that the American troops are vomiting and having diarrhea, and the civilians in the city are too weak to rise up and defend their families. The bridgehead is thus established.

Everything mentioned above is an imaginary picture, describing the misfortune that the United States may encounter if the Third World War breaks out. Fortunately, during World War II, the United States had a wealth of knowledge about the nature of bacteria in order to prevent enemy ambushes. Even if the enemy wanted to use bacteria to attack us, they would have to consider the seriousness of the consequences and the revenge of the United States.

Bacterial warfare is a relatively slow thing. It cannot immediately put a country to death. If the attacked country is prepared, she can also "fight back with tooth and nail." The United States is prepared and has more abundant knowledge of bacterial warfare. Not only can it defend itself, but it can also launch an attack when necessary, dealing with it with more severe measures.

However, most people agree that bacterial warfare is a truly serious threat. This thing, any "small" country can secretly manufacture, turning university laboratories and even wineries into factories for cultivating toxic bacteria.

So, will bacterial warfare really happen? Rear Admiral Smith, Director of the U.S. Military Medical Department, believes that bacterial warfare is really beyond the scope of human control and is equally dangerous to both aggressors and those who are invaded. Unless the enemy is desperate, they may not resort to this tactic.

However, one point is extremely worthy of consideration, that is, the cost of bacterial warfare is relatively low. For example, the United States once spent 200 million US dollars to manufacture atomic bombs, but studying bacteria does not require such a huge amount of money. Therefore, countries that cannot afford atomic bombs have the possibility of trying it out.

### Free Talk - Remaining in the Air - By Shao Fu

Some time ago, plane accidents happened constantly. The Pan Xiaomeng family took a China National Aviation Corporation plane and disappeared without a trace, and there is still no news. Dai Li and his party took a military plane and crashed into a mountain, and the people and plane were destroyed. Therefore, some people who board planes cannot help but hold their breath in fear. Several important people specify that they will only take four-engine planes, reasoning that even if two engines break down, there are still two that can fly.

Friends in the air force often say: Unless necessary, it is best to fly as little as possible. Maybe you fly a hundred times without incident, but once something happens, it's all over. The reasoning is of course very correct. The ancient saying "A son of a wealthy family does not sit under a leaning hall" cannot be compared to this, but self-preservation is the same. I am not an anti-science diehard, and the record of flight accidents today is only about four or five per thousand. However, because airplanes travel in the vast and boundless sky, without any support or reliance, and can disappear without a trace in a minute or a second, it always seems that the risk is very high.

I remember that there was a celebrity who was a scientist and studied abroad. He never took airplanes. When people asked him why, he replied: Unless the airplane can stay in the air. At the time, this answer seemed like a joke, like a myth. On closer thought, airplanes should indeed make progress.

Not long ago, it was proven that this gentleman's words were by no means impossible fantasy. Please see—

[French News Agency, Washington, 27th] According to the Department of the Navy, a new type of American fighter jet is about to be launched that can stay in the air in a straight line. Its model is completely different from existing airplanes. The length of the wings is equal to the frame, and it is extremely fluid. Only two pilots are needed to keep the airplane in the air without falling.

In a few more years, flying in the air will be just like cars on the road. If there is a problem, you can stop and repair it before flying again. What danger is there then!

Science itself represents progress, and the word "unimaginable" will definitely disappear in the future!

### Inferiority - By Ge Shangde

"Inferiority" is like a chain, tightly binding me, making me unable to move at all. In the face of the churning waves, I feel my insignificance. In the face of dedicated scholars, I feel my emptiness. In the face of vigorous young people, I feel my dullness. In short, I am ashamed of my appearance and know that in nature and society, there is nothing to be proud of. Therefore, I have no choice but to feel inferior.

Speaking of pride, really, I also had a period of self-pride several years ago. I was once proud of having written and translated several single-volume books, proud of having sat on the Queen and President and eaten seawater, proud of having stepped on the lecture hall of the university, and even proud of having married a gentle wife and formed a happy little family. But, I don't know when, "inferiority" began to break into my heart and constantly expand its territory. Now, my entire heart has become the realm occupied by "inferiority." Of course, the expansion process of "inferiority" and the reduction process of "pride" are directly proportional—on the one hand, the rapid growth of "inferiority," and on the other hand, the rapid disappearance of "pride."

That is to say, I have a rather significant difference in character from others. (Of course, this may just be my assumption. There may be, or even many, people in the world with the same character as me.) Others have sweet and beautiful memories in their minds. Even if the "subject matter" of this memory, that is, the so-called "past," is bitter and ugly, they will change it into sweetness and beauty under the mood of "nostalgia." As for me, Heaven did not give me this special talent. On the contrary, the various "achievements" that I used to be proud of have now become illusory in retrospect.

I understand that my translations are only the accumulation of soulless lead words that have been rearranged. I understand that eating seawater is not a synonym for the pursuit of knowledge. I understand that stepping on the lecture hall of the university is only the opening of a phonograph. I understand that a small family without an economic foundation will eventually be attacked by poverty. Therefore, I have become a prisoner of "inferiority."

Now, not only do I think of myself as an inferior person, but even close friends think of me as an inferior person. (It must be noted that he and I have been separated for more than ten years. He has not seen the process of my self-pride turning into self-inferiority.)

One day, a friend introduced me to visit a senior I had long admired. After more than ten minutes of conversation, my friend and I excused ourselves and left together. On the way, my friend said to me like this:

"Your attitude just now was too cramped. You only sat on half of the sofa, your body was leaning too much, and you were constantly scratching your head."

My friend's criticism was very pertinent. His words were like a clear mirror. In this mirror, a clear image of my inferior self and my inferior posture was reflected. I couldn't help but ask my image, "Hey! Is that you, me?"

Today, I finally discovered the strict boundary between humility and inferiority: humility can win people's respect, while inferiority, at most, can only win people's pity.

I want to break free from the shackles of "inferiority."

### Needs Stimulation - By Yang Mou

A cup of strong black tea, or a cold ice cream, how much is that worth savoring? Wouldn't the spirit also be refreshed by it? However, a cup of plain boiled water, especially when swallowed in a daze, even when you are most thirsty, often feels like a waste. Without stimulation, it will never arouse love and nostalgia. Once swallowed, everything seems to be over.

That's what I think, and maybe it's just my prejudice. But how can a person living in the world have likes and dislikes? Knowing that it is a poison, you may have to drink it with a frown sometimes. Always pulling the sail with the wind, like a sailing boat sailing in the sea, I don't think it's very possible.

Therefore, I hate, I hate, lukewarm boiled water, it is just an emotional protest, but don't I still drink it all the time? What can I do? I think,

I also hate a lukewarm, boiled-water-like life.

However, among the partners around me, it seems that they have all been infected with the infectious disease of boiled water. They seem to take boiled water as the center of their lives to develop their philosophy of life.

For example, if you have something to find him for, he will not refuse categorically, nor will he fully promise, just vaguely affirming and denying, saying yes and no, and after talking for a day, there is no result. Next is handling procedures, doing official business, procrastinating, or pulling out some seven-pointed and eight-branching relationships, always trying to put out a fire with water from afar, as if slow movement is not

### Piteous Pleas and Desperate Bows: Hospital Doors Swamped with Crowds; Be Cautious in Daily Diet, Lest You Cling to Buddha's Feet at the Last Moment

[Special Dispatch] Due to the recent intense heat in the city, the epidemic is increasingly rampant, spreading at a speed unseen since the Anti-Japanese War. All infectious disease hospitals in the city are experiencing overcrowding, with latecomers finding no room. Until ten days ago, those suffering were mostly from the lower classes, but in recent days, it is not uncommon to see middle and upper-class families infected. Yesterday, when reporters visited various epidemic hospitals, they witnessed each hospital working with extreme tension, with patients being sent in like a tidal wave, day and night, resembling frontline battlefield hospitals. Not only were all wards long since full, but also the corridors and waiting rooms were filled with canvas beds and rattan chairs, sleeping with patients. The West Tibet Road Epidemic Hospital was particularly busy, unable to cope. According to the hospital's doctors, the hospital has received more than four or five times the number of original beds, and the other hospitals are also overflowing. If the government and local figures do not immediately find ways to respond, there is a real fear that the epidemic will become unmanageable. At one o'clock last night, reporters personally witnessed several critically ill patients being sent to the hospital, but within an hour, because the doctors and nurses were too busy, they could not be immediately accommodated for diagnosis and treatment. Furthermore, there were even those who were sent to other epidemic hospitals, but due to lack of space, they were sent back to the west and pleaded desperately, begging to be admitted and treated, a situation of misery unprecedented. It is understood that currently, there are as many as seven or eight public and private hospitals in Shanghai that are accepting epidemic patients, but they are still unable to cope. The Shanghai branch of the Executive Yuan, in order to help the authorities to eliminate the cholera epidemic, has partnered with the Municipal Health Bureau to add 400 temporary beds in the Zhongshan Hospital in the area. In addition to a small number of canvas beds provided by the Health Bureau, the remaining beds and all the necessary supplies will be provided by the office. It is expected that the beds will be open to receive patients within this week. At the same time, the Health Bureau, in view of the intensity of the epidemic, is also planning other emergency response measures to ensure the public safety of the city.

### Municipal Government Approves Epidemic Prevention Funds

[Special Dispatch] The Epidemic Prevention Committee issued a public notice: yesterday, there were 76 new cases of cholera, with 8 deaths, bringing the total to 966 cases and 74 deaths.

The Municipal Government has approved a temporary epidemic prevention fund of over 440 million yuan for the period of July to October, which will be paid by emergency order. The funds for July, over 240 million yuan, will be allocated tomorrow for water well disinfection teams, fly eradication teams, the establishment of additional isolation beds, and the construction of mobile wooden houses.

The Nan Shi People's Hospital at 775 Minguo Road will begin accepting epidemic patients from July 1st. The extremely poor will receive completely free medical treatment, hospitalization, etc., with consultations available day and night. Telephone: (02) 70213.

Wang Shengchang, a local notable from Xujiahui, is organizing free clinics and medicine distribution, starting July 3rd. Poor patients from near and far are welcome to seek medical attention.

### Dramatic Prison Escapee Captured: Flown to the Capital Under Escort

[Special Dispatch] Zheng Changqu, Chief of the Lower Pudong Investigation Office of the Capital Garrison Headquarters, led his staff to Shanghai the day before yesterday to cooperate with the military and police authorities of this city in apprehending Zhang Rongqing and other dramatic prison escapees from Nanjing. Finally, at dawn yesterday morning, Huang Xinfa (aka Xinghai), Xie Ronghua (aka Zhang Rongqing), and Chen Yunqing were arrested successively at No. 128 Zhaofang Lane in South Shanghai and other locations. Two Mauser pistols were also found in Zhang's residence and confiscated immediately. Two hours later, Shen Deheng, Chief of the Yimiao Sub-bureau, received a tip-off that there were illegally hidden firearms at No. 128 Police Lane. He led Section Chief Guo, Officer Cui, and Chen Wanfu and Chen Yuzhi to search the premises. They happened to find Zhang's wife, Zhou Jinfeng, searching between the toilet for two gun parts and a Mauser pistol, along with 73 bullets. She was just about to report to the authorities, so the witness was taken to the bureau, and Chief Zheng was notified to confiscate the firearms. It was found that Zhang and others were originally company and platoon leaders of the Central Tax Police Regiment of the puppet regime, and later joined the Danyang Security Team. After escaping from Nanjing, they specialized in robbing passengers and merchants of their belongings on trains and automobiles along the Nanjing-Wuhu highway. After being recaptured this time, it is reported that they were flown to the capital under escort by the authorities last night for severe punishment.

### Zhang Ke Credited for Contributions: Sentence Reduced by Two and a Half Years

[Special Dispatch] Zhang Ke, who once served as the Vice Minister of Propaganda and later founded the "Daguang" Weekly after leaving office, was sentenced by the High Court yesterday afternoon. The main text of the judgment stated: "Zhang Ke colluded with enemy countries and conspired to rebel against his own country. He is sentenced to two and a half years of imprisonment with deprivation of public rights for two years. All property will be confiscated, except for the necessary living expenses for his family." Presiding Judge Liu Yugui explained that because the defendant founded "Daguang" Weekly after leaving office and disseminated ideas of resistance against Japan, he made contributions to the country, so the sentence was reduced by two and a half years. In addition, Ni Suofu, who opened a machine manufacturing plant, Lin Yifu (aka Lin Yifu), who manufactured firearms for use by enemy troops, and enemy spies Wang Mingqian, Jin Liansheng, Wu Quangen, and Lin Han, who were suspected of being traitors, are scheduled to be sentenced on July 9.

[Additional Report] Fu Qiangeng, Chairman of the Puppet Shanghai Grain Trade Association, was tried yesterday. Fu, during his tenure as a standing committee member and accountant of the puppet Oil and Grain Control Association, borrowed huge sums of money from the puppet Central Reserve Bank, Mitsubishi, Zhengjin, Sumitomo banks to purchase miscellaneous grains from Anqing, Bengbu, and other places in collaboration with the enemy Kurimoto Toraji, with seven or eight tenths of the grain being used by the enemy military to manufacture alcohol. However, Fu denied participating in Kurimoto's grain purchase and tried his best to evade responsibility. In addition, Chen Fenghao, the puppet Taizhou chief, was accused of using his power to oppress the people; Cao Rong, a police officer of the Puppet Nanshi Police Sub-bureau, was accused of spying on military and political news and providing it to the enemy puppets; Yu Yiming, the consultant of the Puppet Central China Tobacco Allocation Group, and Li Chunrong and Huang Qingzhong, the inspectors of the Puppet Shanghai North Station Guard, were also suspected of being traitors. They were interrogated separately and their cases were adjourned for further interrogation.
