People from all walks of life in China and the United States in this city have expressed their satisfaction with this. Mayor Wu expressed particular welcome for the signing of the Sino-American Commercial Treaty, hoping that other countries would follow suit and sign commercial treaties with our country, so that international trade could prosper. Mayor Wu stated that when he was acting as the Minister of Propaganda, he had the opportunity to preview the contents of the draft treaty.

### Mediators Reach a Compromise Plan After Collective Discussion; Seeking Opinions from Both Sides; Issues at Stake Are Listed One by One

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 4th] Peace talks were held all day on the 4th by the Democratic League, the Youth Party, and others, in order to further discuss and study the suggestions made by Zhang Junmai, and have reached a compromise plan. At 9:00 AM, Liang Shuming, Luo Longji, Zhang Shenfu and others gathered at Zhang Junmai's residence and, at the same time, Dang Zhen visited Guangzuo for preliminary discussions. Subsequently, Liang Shuming went to the Jiaotong Bank to meet with Miao Jiaming, Mo Dehui, and Liu Quanying, representative of the Youth Party. Zhang Junmai and Luo Longji visited Zhou Enlai to consult on the Communist Party's opinions on the compromise proposal. At 3:00 PM, Zhang Junmai and others held a meeting at the Jiaotong Bank and invited Lei Zhen to attend to hear the government's opinions. Lei withdrew first, and then continued to discuss the opinions of both parties and revised them into a compromise plan. Although the content of this plan has not been released, it is reported that the degree of peace talks, the reorganization of the National Government, and issues related to the National Assembly are all included. Zhang Shenfu, Zhang Junmai, and Mo Dehui visited Zhou Enlai and returned to the Jiaotong Bank at 6:00 PM to report. It is now scheduled to hold another meeting on the morning of the 5th and invite Zhou Enlai to attend and explain.

### Communist Party Issues Statement Rejecting Participation in the National Assembly

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 4th] Regarding the draft constitution, Wang Huizhen conducted a study with Lei Zhen in his private residence on the evening of the 4th. When Lei returned to his residence, Mo Dehui was already there, and they continued to discuss the draft constitution in detail for over an hour. It is learned that most of the draft constitution formulated by the Constitutional Draft Review Committee of the Political Consultative Conference has been passed, and the unfinished ones are small details, which should be passed by the Constitutional Draft Review Committee immediately. Since the Communist Party has no hope of attending the conference, it was decided to study it, and after the Legislative Yuan completes the legislative procedures, it will be submitted to the National Assembly.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 4th] Mei Yi, a spokesman for the Communist Party, was ordered to issue a statement: (1) The National Assembly to be convened on November 12 is a unilateral action by the government that violates the resolutions and procedures of the Political Consultative Conference, and the Communist Party opposes and refuses to participate in it in any way. (2) The Constitutional Draft Review Committee of the Political Consultative Conference has been suspended since returning to the capital in May, and has not formulated any amendments to the draft constitution. The statement that "the draft constitution formulated by the Constitutional Draft Review Committee of the Political Consultative Conference is used as the blueprint" is unfounded both legally and factually.

### Mayor Wu and Speaker Pan Plan to Host National Assembly Representatives; Representatives All Argue That the National Assembly Cannot Be Postponed

[Our Correspondent] Mayor Wu Guozhen, Speaker Pan Gongzhan, Fang Xikong, Chairman of the Municipal Party Department, and Wu Shao-shu, Chief Secretary of the Youth Corps, jointly held a tea party at the Yuan Yuan Hotel at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 4th to host the National Assembly representatives from Shanghai and those passing through. Representatives from various places including Chen Tingrui, Chen Shiquan, He Yuanming, Xi Yushu, Jiang Jianbai, Zhu Fengwei, Zhou Feicheng, Zai Qi Zhang, Deputy Speaker Xu Jiqing, Director Wu Kaixian, Secretary-General He DeKui, Secretary-General Xiang Changquan, and Director Zhang Xiaosong and over forty other people attended. First, the mayor delivered a speech, stating briefly: Today is to bid farewell to the representatives. The hospitality is simple. Shanghai's facilities are difficult. The National Assembly representatives are representatives of the national public opinion. I hope that they will give more instructions. Then, Speaker Pan delivered a speech, stating: The convening of the National Assembly is the beginning of democratic constitutionalism. The National Assembly representatives have the responsibility of drafting the constitution. Our country has been preparing for the National Assembly since 1936, but it has been repeatedly delayed due to the eight-year war of resistance and the repeated political twists and turns in the country. The various post-war reconstruction work takes time, resulting in delays. It is gratifying that the National Assembly has been decided to convene on November 12. However, it is reported that it may be adjourned or postponed after the opening. In my personal opinion, whether to adjourn or not after the opening, and whether it can be adjourned, is entirely up to the National Assembly itself. Before the congress is held, we, standing on the position of representatives, say that if it is necessary to adjourn after the opening, a deadline should also be set, and it should not be delayed due to the issues of representatives of a few parties.

Then, Chairman Fang emphasized that the constitution should be based on the Three Principles of the People. Jiang Huaisu, a representative from Shanghai, expressed agreement with Speaker Pan's opinion, stating that the representatives must have firm common opinions, and the country only allows one government and cannot tolerate other parties with armed forces. Later, He Jinquan, a representative from South Africa, and Liu Ruxin, a representative from Europe, delivered speeches, representing overseas Chinese, hoping that the National Assembly would be convened as scheduled, and expressed that overseas Chinese absolutely love the motherland and are willing to do their best to assist compatriots in the country to build a new China. Dai Jingchen, a representative from Hubei, also hoped that the National Assembly would be convened as scheduled and should not be treated as child's play.

### Wang Maogong Tours Northern Jiangsu; Communist Troops in Jiaodong Conscript Heavy Troops to Attack

[Our Zhenjiang Correspondent, 4th] Confirmed news: A certain unit of the National Army, advancing north from Xinghua, has been unstoppable since launching a counterattack at the end of October and has stationed itself in the Lirenji and Wangji areas on the 3rd.

[Our Zhenjiang Correspondent, 4th] Although the war in northern Jiangsu has come to an end after the Communist troops' defeat along the Grand Canal, their policy of killing and arson has become increasingly active. According to a visitor from Xinghua, from October 25th to the present, no fewer than 3,000 people, regardless of age, have been massacred within the city and in the southeastern countryside. The public security in the rural areas is extremely chaotic, making it difficult for the county government to promote autonomous governance. They earnestly hope that the government will quickly dispatch a large army to clear the villages as soon as possible to console the people. Furthermore, small groups of Communist troops have been causing disturbances in the rural areas of Sishui Township in Baoying in recent days. The stationed troops are currently searching and suppressing them.

The main force of the Communist troops retreating from Dongtai has withdrawn to the vicinity of Panjiachang, about 80 li from Dongtai, numbering about four regiments. Their situation seems extremely anxious. It remains to be seen within the next week whether the Communist troops are expecting reinforcements from southern Shandong to make a final struggle in Yancheng and Funing, or whether they will preserve their remaining forces and flee north en masse, escaping into the border region of Shandong, Henan, and Anhui to await an opportunity to stir up trouble.

[Our Report] Sources informed our reporter that the figures for international industrial and agricultural relief supplies shipped to China in September and October were the lowest in a year. The reasons are: first, the major U.S. maritime strike, which remains unresolved, has had the greatest impact on the shipment of supplies to China; second, most agricultural machinery needs to be ordered in the U.S., but the U.S. itself has a very pressing need, requiring time for ordering, while the UK and Canada can only manufacture a small portion in this regard, resulting in a small quantity being shipped to China. It is generally estimated that the import volume will reach its peak in February and March of next year. As for the comparison between the original planned figures for various major agricultural implements and the numbers already shipped, it is roughly as follows:

(Original Planned Number)

(Number Already Shipped) (As of September)

Tractors 2,000 208

Plows 500 44

Harrows 2,000 50

Cultivators 2,000 20

Trailers 2,000 30

(2-inch)

Centrifugal Pumps 2,000 0

(4-inch)

Same as Above 3,000 0

(5-inch)

Same as Above 2,500 0

Same as Above

1,000 17

(8-inch)

Same as Above 1,000 0

(12-inch)

Propeller Pumps 300 0

Well Drilling Machines 200 23

Feet Feet

4-inch Well Pipes 10,000 101,730

Feet Feet

8-inch Well Pipes 20,000 150,945

Note: Due to a shortage of 6-inch pipes, the UNRRA substituted them with 4-inch and 8-inch pipes, hence exceeding the original quota.

Seed Drills 60 60

From the above table, it can be seen that the supplies already shipped are far from the planned figures. However, according to sources, the international impression of the agricultural machinery used in China is very good, so the original figures will not be reduced. Given the vastness of China's area, even if all of it is shipped, it will not be enough to allocate. However, UNRRA's view is that these supplies are only to assist China in carrying out relief work, cultivating land that was uncultivated during the war, so that it can resume production in the future; as for the implementation of agricultural mechanization, it is a matter for China itself and is not of concern to UNRRA.

### UNRRA Ships Approximately 40,000 Tons of Fertilizer to China

Furthermore, according to information obtained by this reporter, as of now, UNRRA has shipped approximately 40,000 tons of fertilizer to China, including fertilizer that has not yet been unloaded. In terms of distribution, two-thirds have been shipped to Taiwan in the past; because Taiwan is located in the subtropics and can be planted twice a year, the fertilizer shipped from October to December can only be used in Taiwan. Under Japanese rule, Taiwan consumed 400,000 tons of fertilizer annually, so Taiwan Province will account for at least one-half of the allocation of imported fertilizer for the coming year. In addition to Taiwan, the remaining amount will be allocated to Guangdong, Guangxi, Hubei, Anhui, Henan, and Jiangxi provinces. Furthermore, UNRRA has fertilizer manufacturing equipment worth over US$1 million, which is scheduled to be allocated to the Yongli Chemical Industries. The authorities intend to allocate this equipment to Yongli for free first, and then enter into a contract under which the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry will purchase all of its products at a relatively low price, which will be used to offset the price of the equipment and be paid off within two years. In this way, both the production of chemical fertilizers in China can be increased, and private industry can also benefit. This equipment can be shipped in the spring of next year.

### Northeast Coal Production Expected to Reach 5 Million Tons Next Year

But Mining Equipment Replenishment is Difficult

[Our Tianjin Correspondent, 4th] Cheng Zongyang, Director of the Fushun Mining Bureau, told reporters that the coal production of various coal mines in Northeast China has been decided to be increased to 5 million tons next year. According to relevant parties, the actual amount may exceed this number. There are currently no accurate statistics on the coal demand in Northeast China. The mining bureau hopes that one-fifth of the output can be shipped out to exchange for funds to purchase equipment. Various mines have a suffocating feeling about the control of remittances in Northeast China because the working capital of various mines in Northeast China cannot be remitted out as needed, making equipment replenishment extremely difficult.

Editorial

### Signing of the New Sino-American Commercial Treaty

The Sino-American Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation was signed yesterday in Nanjing by Mr. Wang Shijie, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Mr. Wang Huacheng, the Director of the Treaty Department, representing China, and Mr. Stuart, the American Ambassador to China, and Mr. Smith, the Special Envoy and Consul General in Tianjin, representing the United States. The new commercial treaty is broad in scope and is based on the principle of mutual benefit and equality. All rights enjoyed by American individuals and companies in China can also be enjoyed by Chinese individuals and companies in the United States, and all rights are clearly and comprehensively stipulated in the treaty. The new treaty is set for a term of five years, but if neither party expresses its intention to terminate the treaty one year before the expiration date, the treaty will continue to be valid. The signing of this treaty is indeed the first major event in our post-war diplomacy. Moreover, we believe that the mutual signing of commercial treaties between China and other friendly nations will follow. Although this new commercial treaty is still subject to ratification by the highest legislative bodies of China and the United States, the signing is based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, and it is a concrete manifestation of the amicable relationship between China and the United States. We are especially gratified that this commercial treaty has been signed at this time.

A treaty of friendship, commerce, and navigation is the basic code of conduct for relations between countries. It stipulates everything concerning the treatment of the people of both countries who travel to and reside in each other's country. Because of the rights and obligations of the nationals of the two countries, the provisions of this treaty are equivalent to the provisions of law and are part of the laws of each country. Therefore, a treaty of friendship, commerce, and navigation is one of the most important treaties in relations between countries. Although our country signed new treaties of equality with Britain, the United States, and other countries some years ago, the new treaties only stipulated general principles and did not have provisions for rights and obligations. Moreover, in nature, they were more passive than active, and their purpose was mainly to abolish unequal treaties and the privileges that came with them. A treaty of commerce and navigation is needed to further develop the relations between the two countries based on the previous treaty and to make general and detailed provisions for the interactions between the two countries and to re-establish the new relations between the two countries. This is a constructive treaty that rebuilds the relationship between the two countries on a new and equal foundation. China and the United States face each other across the Pacific Ocean, and the relationship between the two countries has always been close. Now, following the abolition of unequal treaties, we see that our ally has taken the lead in signing a treaty of commerce and navigation with our country, re-establishing the relationship between China and the United States on a new foundation. The Chinese people will naturally welcome the establishment of this new relationship with great joy.

According to reports, the content of the Sino-American Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation is characterized by "eliminating the last vestiges of extraterritoriality," based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, and stipulating the principles for the two countries to engage in commerce with each other in a clear and legal manner. Indeed, although the previous new treaties signed with the United States had provisions for the abandonment of all privileges, how to eliminate the "last vestiges of extraterritoriality" depended on the signing of a treaty of commerce and navigation. Under the current environment in China, the new rights obtained by American merchants in China may not be fully realized, but since there are provisions for these new rights, it can be asserted that American people in China will be able to enjoy them in the future when the situation in China becomes clear. The attitude of the American community in Shanghai towards the signing of the Sino-American commercial treaty was quite reserved, and some expressed their opposition, believing that they had already given up extraterritoriality, and the so-called "last vestiges of extraterritoriality" was incomprehensible. All these expressions are motivated by sincere intentions, but if not restricted, the results may create a purpose contrary to the original intention of the signing of this commercial treaty. Therefore, we would like to make a special point here to the American merchants residing in our country that although the current situation does not fully conform to the ideals stipulated in the treaty, this is a temporary phenomenon and will definitely be eliminated after the situation becomes clear. We need to be patient at this time.

Now that the relationship between China and the United States has been established on a new foundation due to the signing of this commercial treaty, we sincerely hope that other countries will follow the United States and sign treaties of commerce and navigation with our country on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. Although China, the Soviet Union, Britain, France, and the Netherlands have new treaty relations, commercial treaties have yet to be signed. China and the Soviet Union are geographically adjacent, and our country's Northeast and Northwest regions have particularly frequent trade contacts with the Soviet Union. We hope that a commercial treaty between China and the Soviet Union can also be signed soon. As for Britain, France, the Netherlands, and other countries, their commercial relations with our country have always been close, and it goes without saying that they should sign this commercial treaty as soon as possible to establish a new relationship. Therefore, due to the signing of the new Sino-American commercial treaty, we hope that other countries can also establish new commercial treaty relations with our country as soon as possible.

Needless to say, the signing of this Sino-American commercial treaty will greatly benefit the promotion of Sino-American commercial relations. China is moving towards the great path of nation-building, and the United States can provide us with great assistance in our efforts to build the country. Similarly, the emergence of a new China can also be of great help to the United States' own economy. Although Sino-American trade is currently developed, everything has not yet been normalized. This will have to wait until the situation in China stabilizes before Sino-American trade can have normal development. We welcome the signing of the Sino-American commercial treaty at this time, because the signing of the commercial treaty itself is a force for stability. We are willing to see more factual evidence of how to strengthen Sino-American commercial and general relations due to the signing of this commercial treaty.

Finally, on the occasion of the signing of this new Sino-American commercial treaty, we occasionally find that a small number of American expatriates have recently published unfriendly comments about China that contain misunderstandings, which is very regrettable. For example, the letter from a reader signed "Former Friend of China" published in the Da Mei Evening News on the 2nd of this month is one example. This reader only knows how to scold the Chinese people, even saying that they are "like a vicious dog biting the hand of its master, clamoring for all foreigners to leave China," so he wants to suggest that foreigners launch a "Leave China" movement. Some of the facts cited in this letter, such as the delay in returning the property of American expatriates occupied by the enemy, are something that we Chinese people should reflect on in order to be understood by others, but the prejudice of this reader, who sees a part of those who have ulterior motives and clamor for "anti-Americanism" as the opinion of the entire Chinese people, is too blind. In short, the most important thing for countries to get along with each other is to understand each other, and since China and the United States are called friends, they especially need to trade, so they especially need to respect each other psychologically and sweep away any biased prejudices. However, one point is that after the signing of the new treaty, since the "last vestiges of extraterritoriality" have been eliminated, our treatment of American expatriates in China should be the same as the treatment of Chinese expatriates in the United States, with reciprocal treatment, and there is no need for discriminatory laws, such as having an alien exit travel permit in addition to a passport, which seems superfluous. We firmly believe that the friendship between China and the United States, the two great allies, will be further enhanced by the signing of this new commercial treaty; we are willing to see Chinese and American people, whether in or out of government, take it as their duty to strengthen their national relations in all their words and deeds, and not give others the opportunity to sow discord.

### Wuxi Station Incident Resolved: Cadets of the Military Officer Corps Comply with Orders to Withdraw; Railway Police Resume Defense Duties After Screening

[Wuxi News] The Wuxi section of the Two Railway Bureau Police Department had a conflict with cadets of the 17th Military Officer Corps stationed in Wuxi on the 1st of this month due to the matter of soldiers riding the train without tickets. The Railway Bureau Police Department attached great importance to this and repeatedly sent senior officials to Wuxi to investigate the truth. Vice Director Li, Chen Daqing, the Wuxi City Defense Commander, Cai, the head of the 9th Military Police Regiment, Tao Liu, the head of the 17th Military Officer Corps, and others negotiated a solution to quell the dispute. In order to avoid the expansion of the incident, the police department authorities have found ways to isolate the cadets who caused the trouble, so the seriousness of the matter has been eliminated, and the dispute has come to an end. Discussions on the aftermath will be held in the future. The City Defense Command issued an order yesterday: (1) Cadets transferred to the Northeast should depart as soon as possible. (2) Cadets stationed along the railway line should be withdrawn immediately. (3) The 17th Military Officer Corps should form a disciplinary team to assist in maintaining order at the Wuxi Station.

Since the Railway Police Department authorities ordered the temporary withdrawal of the Wuxi section railway police, the security of Wuxi Station has been maintained by the City Defense Command and the Military Police Regiment. Now that the dispute has been eliminated, and because the responsibility for protecting the railway lies with the police, it has been decided that after screening the good railway police who are not suspected of causing the incident, the vacancies will be filled with railway police stationed in Suzhou, and they will be sent to Wuxi to resume defense duties.

### Zhejiang Construction Funds: Central Government Allocation Still Insufficient

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 4th] For the construction of water conservancy and transportation, Zhejiang Province is raising funds.

Upon returning to Hangzhou, Mr. Pi told our reporter that the Ministry of Transportation is now planning national highways, with the Shanghai-Kunming trunk line in the east-west direction, the Guangping line in the north-south direction, and the Fuzhou-Lanzhou-Xinjiang line in the southeast-northwest direction. The sections passing through this province include the Shanghai-Hangzhou, Hangzhou-Huizhou, and Beijing-Hangzhou lines, and the Ministry of Transportation will allocate 5 billion for construction. The rest will be handled by the province itself. 300 million was allocated at the beginning of this month, 200 million will be allocated at the end of the month, and another 1 billion will be allocated before March next year, for a total of 1.5 billion, which is far from the original request of 4.05 billion.

### Rush Repair of the Dangerous Dikes in Haining: Construction Plan Drafted

[Our Haining News] Since the autumn floods, the "Jue," "Zi," and "Du" stone dikes of the "Zi Du Pan Tou" in the Hanghai section on the north bank of the Qiantang River suddenly cracked, the dangerous situation has reached its peak.

When the Dike Works Bureau sent personnel to measure, they also discovered that the lower layer had been eroded by the tide into a cave, causing the dike body to tilt outwards. Hua Guanshi, the section chief of the Hanghai section, reported the facts to the Zhejiang Dike Works Bureau, and the Bureau believes that rush repairs are urgently needed. It has specially convened Chinese and foreign experts to draft a plan and has sent a letter to the Zhejiang-Fujian Branch of the Executive Yuan requesting the allocation of machinery, materials, and relief powder. It has been learned that the rush repair plan has been drafted, and the Executive Yuan has agreed to allocate the required resources. Construction will begin as soon as the tools and materials are collected.

### Constructing a Taihu Telecommunications Network Along the Suxi Yi Highway

[Our Wuxi News] The Jiangsu Provincial Government believes that during this period of pacification in the Taihu area, all the telephone lines in the towns and villages along the Suxi Yi Highway should be restored and completed as soon as possible.

### Jiangsu Provincial Government Orders All Counties to Protect the Safety of Travelers

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 4th] Although the Jiangnan area has been suppressed for more than a month, bandits and scattered soldiers still frequently commit robberies, looting vehicles and ships, and killing and injuring people.

### Dongtai Market Gradually Prospers: Water Transport to Taizhou Expected to be Smooth Soon

More than a thousand displaced people return to their hometowns from other ports every day, and the import of supplies is also increasing. However, institutions such as banks, post offices, and telecommunications have failed to recover in line with the progress of the military. It is also learned that water transport between Dongtai and Taizhou is expected to resume soon.

[Our Rugao Dispatch, 4th] A reporter arrived in Nantong from Dongtai after traveling 240 li through wind and sand. The places along the way, such as Liangduo, Anfeng, Fuan, Benjiaji, Hai'an, Rugao, and Baipu, have all been subjected to the baptism of artillery fire. Coffins and ruined walls are visible along the road, and the scene after the robbery is unbearable to watch.

In recent days, the investigation has become increasingly severe, and Mr. Cao felt that he had no way to shirk responsibility. (2) The major robbery of the Chengxiang Xinfu Silver Shop in July of this year has not yet been solved, and the higher authorities are strictly supervising the case. Mr. Cao felt ashamed to face the local area. (3) His subordinates often abused their power and accepted bribes, which involved him to a considerable extent. Mr. Cao felt that his situation was difficult. (4) In the 31st year, his son was arrested. His brother, Cheng, instigated Ri Wei to kill him. Mr. Cao was bound by his teacher's orders and could not seek revenge, and his widowed daughter-in-law cried day and night. Mr. Cao felt that he had no interest in life. Accumulation over time resulted in a tragic outcome. Huang Jinrong, a well-known figure in Shanghai, has sent a telegram to express his condolences to the bereaved family and will send special personnel to Suzhou to handle the funeral.

Improving the City Center Transportation Network

The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Public Transportation Company writes: The Reader Opinions column on October 27th contained an article by Mr. Wei Zhesheng titled "The Issue of Developing Greater Shanghai," which proposed three suggestions for restoring public buses in the city center. Here is a response to each point: (1) The Committee is currently planning to operate the No. 8 bus route, starting from the North Railway Station, passing through Baoshan Road, Tiantong'an, the West Sports Club Road, Weidema Road, and reaching the Wujiaochang area in the city center, which is roughly the same as the route operated by the former China Merchants Public Bus. However, the section from Wujiaochang to the original site of the City Government has few residents after the war, so it will not be extended for the time being. (2) The No. 8 bus is currently being prepared and is expected to be in operation by mid-November. There is no need to extend the No. 7 bus for the time being. (3) Has been detailed in sections (1) and (2), no further explanation is needed.

Correcting the Expenses of Representative Assemblies

The First Section of the Civil Affairs Department of the Shanghai Municipal Government writes: A letter from Mr. Xu Wenyu, an enlightened person, was forwarded on September 26th regarding the last proposal of the Fourth District Residents' Representative Assembly at its first meeting to raise funds for the assembly's expenses, which were to be shared by each representative. Each person was required to pay a membership fee of 9,250 yuan, and it was planned to collect the money immediately. The letter asked whether this kind of collection of membership fees was reasonable. According to the regulations, the operating expenses of the residents' representative assemblies in each district of the city are paid monthly by the Municipal Government, and there is no provision for collecting membership fees from the residents' representatives. This kind of situation is naturally unreasonable. It was previously ordered to be corrected when the Fourth District Residents' Representative Assembly submitted the minutes of its first meeting.

Throwing Firecrackers on the Streets Impairs Tranquility

Recently, unscrupulous people have been throwing firecrackers in the streets and alleys, often frightening young children and women, which not only harms morality but also disrupts social tranquility.

### Foreign Ministers' Conference Faces Numerous Obstacles: Trieste and Danube Shipping Issues Most Troublesome

[Report from This Newspaper] San Francisco, 4th (Radio): The four foreign ministers met in a secret room at the Astoria Hotel in New York this afternoon at 4 PM (3 AM on the 5th, Shanghai time), with extremely tight security. Those in attendance were Byrnes, Molotov, Bevin, and Meuviel, representing French Foreign Minister Bidault. Today's meeting will fully determine the agenda, and substantive discussions can begin on Tuesday. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes hopes that this conference can achieve three definite preliminary methods regarding the German peace treaty: (1) All countries should express a definite attitude on the forty-year agreement to disarm Germany (note: the Soviet Union has consistently not expressed agreement). (2) The issue of German borders should be resolved. (3) The four foreign ministers' representatives should immediately begin actual work on the German treaty, to be considered by the four foreign ministers themselves within four years.

[United Press, New York, 4th] The Four Foreign Ministers Conference opened here today and will first conclude the outstanding cases of the peace treaties with Italy, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, and Finland. Regarding this, there is a minor dispute between the United States and the Soviet Union. The United States insists that the New York Four Foreign Ministers Conference should be based on the final draft determined by the 21-nation representatives at the Paris Peace Conference, while the Soviet Union disagrees, arguing that the initial decisions made by the Paris Four Foreign Ministers Conference should be compared with the subsequent amendments made by the 21-nation conference, and that the latter should not be considered the final draft. However, this issue should not delay the work of this Four Foreign Ministers Conference.

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 4th] The four foreign ministers are scheduled to meet today to discuss peace treaties with the five defeated European nations. This is the fifth time the four foreign ministers have discussed the peace treaties. The first meeting was held in London in September 1945, only six weeks after the Potsdam Declaration, and the result was a complete deadlock. The second meeting was held in Moscow, without the presence of China and France, and the result was more successful. However, the real progress was only made during the third and fourth meetings held in Paris this spring and summer, which laid the foundation for the peace conference, leading to the convening of the 21-nation conference. However, it was almost assumed at the time that the various recommendations of the peace conference would be given final consideration by another foreign ministers' conference, which is the conference that is opening today. The peace treaties with the five nations have been largely approved by the peace conference. At this point, the four foreign ministers are only considering clarifying some outstanding issues among the four powers, but the four countries have vastly different views on these issues, and the success or failure of the conference depends on whether an agreement can be reached, with the issues of Trieste and Danube River navigation being the most troublesome. As for the German peace treaty issue, even if it is not formally addressed, it will be discussed informally. In short, this session of the Four Foreign Ministers Conference is of great importance to the future peace mechanism in Europe and should not be taken lightly.

### Bulgaria Sends Memorandum, Submits Five Demands

[Report from This Newspaper] San Francisco, 4th (Radio): The Bulgarian government has sent a memorandum to the four foreign ministers, submitting five demands: (1) Recognize Bulgaria as a co-belligerent during the war. (2) Allow Bulgaria to find an outlet on the Aegean Sea. (3) Bulgaria has the right to possess torpedo boats. (4) Bulgaria should receive assistance for reconstruction. (5) The clause in the peace treaty regarding the demilitarization of the Greek border should be cancelled, as the border has already been demilitarized.

### Italy Opposes the Peace Treaty

Claiming it Violates the Atlantic Charter

[Reuters, London, 3rd] Rome Radio reported that the Italian Foreign Minister met with American reporters and said that the Italian government will submit a memorandum to the four foreign ministers next Friday, stating that the draft Italian peace treaty is inconsistent with the principles of the Atlantic Charter and will be opposed by the Italian government. The memorandum will be personally delivered by the Italian Ambassador to the United States, Tarchiani, to the four foreign ministers. The main points are: (1) The draft Italian peace treaty is inconsistent with the principles of the Atlantic Charter. (2) The Italian southern boundary line, the boundary line of the Free Territory of Trieste, and the Italian-French boundary line cannot guarantee the integrity of Italian territory. (3) Reparations are offset by Italian property abroad, making it impossible for Italy to bear the burden, and its economic capacity is seriously damaged. Nenni also said that the issue of Italian colonies remains unresolved. The Italian delegation was invited to the United States, not to discuss the peace treaty, but to express its views on the issue of colonies. Nenni also stated that he would never negotiate directly with Yugoslavia and went on to say that he intended to visit the capitals of the world's major powers to discuss trade agreements with them. The Italian delegation will soon depart for London and finally expressed that Italy should safeguard its own interests within the scope of the interests of the world and Europe.

### Security Council Meets to Discuss Polish Proposal

[Report from This Newspaper] San Francisco, 4th (Radio): The Security Council will meet at 3 PM today to discuss Poland's proposal. Poland has requested that the Security Council no longer review the Franco issue so that it can be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly. It is expected that Poland's proposal will be passed. According to the Charter, if any issue is still on the agenda of the Security Council, the United Nations General Assembly cannot take any action on it.

### United Nations Representatives Visit Roosevelt's Tomb

Soviet Foreign Minister Presents Red Rose Wreath

[Agence France-Presse, Hyde Park, New York, 4th] Representatives from the 51 nations of the United Nations General Assembly, led by Assembly President Spaak, yesterday paid public tribute to the late President Roosevelt at the grave in the Rose Garden Cemetery. Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt was also present. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, accompanied by Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky and others, placed a wreath of red roses in front of the late President's tomb and made a brief speech, saying: "I believe that the sentiments of the Soviet delegation can be expressed in one sentence, which is "Eternal remembrance of the great President Roosevelt"."

### President of Yugoslavia Confident War Will Not Happen

[United Press, Belgrade, 3rd] President Tito said in a speech to a crowd of 300,000 people today, "I am sure there will be no war, because the people of the whole world do not want war.

### U.S. Army Reserve: Scale and Organization Comprehensive

Millions of Veteran Officers and Soldiers Enlist

[United Press, Washington, 4th] The U.S. Army Department disclosed today that the U.S. Army Reserve is being effectively formed after the war, with nearly one million veteran officers and soldiers enlisting. According to official sources, the scale of the reserve is currently expanding at the predetermined rate, or perhaps even faster than the predetermined rate. At the same time, the scope of the regular army is rapidly decreasing, and the smaller-scale National Guard is now striving to overcome difficulties in obtaining recruits to replenish its strength.

### New Greek Cabinet Formed

[Reuters, Athens, 3rd] Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris presented a list of new cabinet members to the Greek King tonight. The new cabinet will be sworn in tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.

### U.S. Decides to Maintain Long-Term Sole Custody of Pacific Bases: President Truman Reaffirms Position

[Reuters, Independence, Missouri, 3rd] President Truman reaffirmed today that the United States has decided to retain sole control of the Japanese islands in the Pacific that are of significant importance to U.S. security for a long period of time. Islands that are not of significant importance to U.S. security will be handed over to United Nations organizations or will have a collective trusteeship system established there.

### Trusteeship Issue

U.S. and Soviet Opinions Fail to Align

[United Press, Lake Success, 3rd] It is rumored that the Soviet government may take action to prevent the establishment of the United Nations Trusteeship Council, and the U.S. delegation to the General Assembly is making great efforts to reverse this. According to well-informed sources, the U.S. delegation has been consulting with several delegations, including the Soviet Union, after rumors that the Soviet government may take a position arguing that no trusteeship agreement can be established without Soviet approval. This involves a legal issue, namely whether the Soviet Union is a "directly concerned state" as defined by the United Nations Charter. The Charter stipulates that all directly concerned states should approve the various drafts before they can be accepted. The Soviet Union believes that all five major powers, in their capacity as trustee states to the Trusteeship Council, meet the definition of the Charter. It is heard that the U.S. delegation has directly appealed to the Soviet Union and other countries to delay any interpretation of what constitutes a directly concerned state in order to ensure the establishment of the Trusteeship Council during this session of the United Nations General Assembly. The U.S. delegation has not yet decided whether the five major powers should be considered concerned states. If the Soviet Union insists on being a directly concerned state, the issue will inevitably be put to a vote at the General Assembly. The Soviet Union can exercise its right, which is equivalent to a veto, unless the General Assembly decides by a two-thirds majority that the Soviet Union is a concerned state. The Trusteeship Council cannot be established unless the organization's draft is passed by the concerned states and the General Assembly. The 51-nation Trusteeship Committee of the General Assembly will begin a general discussion on eight drafts this week, and the Soviet Union will probably use this opportunity to express its position.

### British Home Fleet Conducts Attack and Defense Drills

[Reuters, Weymouth, Dorset, 3rd] The British Home Fleet has returned to the Portland Naval Base today after conducting four days of simulated war exercises. The learning commander was Admiral Aifrey, with the battleship "George V" as the flagship. Participating were various types of ships, including the newest cruiser that began service shortly after the Japanese surrender, along with the aircraft carrier "Invincible" and "Sunderland" aircraft, Spitfire aircraft of the Royal Air Force, and submarines. A realistic attack and defense battle was staged in the sea area from the far north of Scotland to the south coast of England. Off the coast of Hayling Island, a convoy of four supply ships was also formed, which was subjected to a joint attack by underwater and air forces.

### U.S. Congressional and Gubernatorial Elections: Winners Could Be Decided Today

Dewey Expected to Be Reelected as Governor of New York

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 3rd] The U.S. congressional and gubernatorial elections will be decided by American voters on November 5th. Many people are vying for these positions, with the most exciting and important elections being in the states of New York and California. The elections in these two states have attracted the attention of a group of commentators, as the candidates are all nationally known figures. Republican Dewey, who lost to Roosevelt in the 1944 presidential election and is considered a presidential candidate in 1948, is now seeking re-election as Governor of New York. His opponent is Democratic Senator Mead, who is influential in Congress and has been a strong supporter of Roosevelt and Truman. Polls indicate that Dewey has a strong chance of winning. The speeches in the New York campaign have mostly focused on the housing shortage and other domestic issues. The Republican candidate has fiercely attacked the government's mismanagement of domestic affairs, but the attitude towards the established U.S. foreign policy is represented by the declaration of Ives, the Republican leader of the New York State Assembly, who fully supports this policy.

[Report from This Newspaper] San Francisco, 4th (Radio): The U.S. general election began yesterday, with 35 million voters. The results of this election will determine whether President Truman's regime can continue to control Congress. All parties are extremely concerned about the election results, and many are betting on them. It is generally believed that the Republican Party will have an advantage in the House of Representatives, while the Democratic Party may have a slight lead in the Senate. The Democratic Party, seeing the Republican Party's aggressive advance, has fought with all its might. Some party members are attempting to win victory with the "divine voice" of the late President Roosevelt. Recordings of Roosevelt's speeches have been played everywhere, and Mrs. Roosevelt has also been giving speeches everywhere, working for the Democratic Party.

### Soviet Revolution Anniversary: Stalin to Give Speech

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 4th] It has been learned that Stalin will deliver a broadcast speech to the nation on the 6th of this month, on the eve of the 29th anniversary of the October Revolution in the Soviet Union. Moscow will use approximately 300 loudspeakers to broadcast this speech.

### Soviet Foreign Policy: No Intention to Hinder Financial and Cultural Exchange

[United Press, Moscow, 3rd] Pravda published an article today clarifying Soviet foreign policy, stating that the Soviet Union will never hinder the improvement of commercial and cultural relations between its country and the rest of the world. The Soviet Union does not infringe on the legitimate interests of the United States or any other country anywhere in the world. Premier Stalin has already stated this. Since the establishment of the Soviet Union is based on mutual respect and equality of rights, it will never hinder the vigorous exchange of finance, science, and culture between each other.

### Post-War Japanese Whaling Fleet to Depart for First Time Next Week

### U.S. Rejects Soviet Proposal on Japanese Reparations Issue

[United Press, Washington, 4th] United Press learned today that the U.S. government has rejected the Soviet Union's proposal to exclude the large amount of industrial equipment seized by the Soviet Union from Manchuria from the scope of Japanese reparations. This has caused a new setback to the efforts of the Far Eastern Commission to convene a Japanese reparations conference.

### Japanese Socialist Party Declares No More Cooperation with the Cabinet: Yoshida Announces Six Concrete Policies

[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 4th] In order to solve the food problem after the constitution was enacted, the Japanese Socialist Party abandoned its position as an opposition party in the long 90th Diet session, expressing cooperation with the government. Now that the new constitution has been promulgated and the time has come to solve the food problem, the party suddenly declared that it would restore its future position on the ground of the working masses and determined its attitude as an opposition party. The party held a meeting of the Central Executive Committee today to discuss whether to immediately launch a no-confidence motion against the Yoshida Cabinet when the 91st extraordinary Diet session is convened in late November, or whether to submit a motion of no confidence in the Yoshida Cabinet. After discussion, it was agreed that the six major urgent policies announced by the cabinet today did not form the basis for Japan's post-defeat reconstruction, so a motion of no confidence should be submitted immediately. At the same time, a statement was issued denying the rumors that the party would continue to cooperate with the Yoshida Cabinet, and it was decided to unite democratic forces to fight against the conservative camp.

[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 4th] The Japanese government issued a statement this morning clarifying the basic policies after the closing of the extraordinary session and the promulgation of the constitution, and announced the specific matters that must be implemented immediately, calling on the people to cooperate. The content of the statement first emphasized that in order to realize democracy, the education system must first be reformed, and the economic foundation of national life must be established to rebuild a peaceful country and enlighten national culture. The six specific policies mentioned are (1) Popularization of the new constitution, (2) Reform of the education system, (3) Reform of the administrative structure, civil service system, and its operation, (4) Establishment of local autonomy, (5) Reconstruction of the industrial economy, (6) Resolution of labor problems and stabilization of people's livelihood. The above content is aimed at the labor unrest after the October Offensive, and it attempts to solve various problems in one fell swoop, which can be said to be the first concrete policy announced by the Yoshida Cabinet since its establishment. The most important labor countermeasures among them have some new directions. The item "reasonable participation in management and promotion of profit distribution" runs counter to the previous statement denying labor management production, indicating that the Yoshida Cabinet has to attach importance to labor and seek its active assistance, which can be said to be a major shift in the cabinet's labor policy.

MacArthur Authorizes Construction of Small Ferries

### British Newspaper Points Out Japan's New Constitution - Says It Is America's Constitution

[Reuters, London, 4th] The leading newspaper of the Conservative Party in Northern England, the "Yorkshire Post," commented today: The new constitution announced in Tokyo is not a Japanese constitution but an American one. This constitution, along with other phenomena in Japanese daily life, gives the impression that MacArthur is the Emperor of Japan. The only path for the Japanese is to please the commissioner. Those who understand the Japanese people best cannot help but doubt whether it is wise to overthrow a two-thousand-year-old system and force Western democratic ideas upon the Japanese. The problem in Japan today lies between the feudal system and good government. Only through their own realization, rather than being forced by others, can the painful lessons learned during the war produce good results.

### India and the Netherlands Issue Ceasefire Order

### Palestine Terrorist Group - Inside Story of the Stern Gang

[Reuters, Paris, 4th] A reporter from the French "Resistance Daily" interviewed a leader of the Palestinian terrorist group Stern Gang near Paris. During the conversation, they were separated by a curtain and could only hear each other's voices without seeing each other's faces. According to the leader, the Stern Gang has contact with all elements resisting British imperialism, such as Indians, Irish, Greeks, Egyptians, Syrians, and Indonesians. The gang has first-class intelligence personnel who have been trained by former British and American intelligence agencies and Soviet secret police. The gang even has intelligence contacts within the British intelligence services. The gang can eavesdrop on official British telephones, and secret microphones are placed in British government offices, so the gang can learn of any British plans in advance. The leader predicted that terrorist activities in Palestine will increase and stated that the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Hajj Amin al-Husseini, is a British spy, so Stern Gang agents constantly monitor him secretly.

### Luce Left Japan Yesterday to Return Home

Our duty lies not only in making every effort to stop the immediate crisis but also in eliminating all the fundamental causes that give rise to the crisis. No one can tolerate the behavior of people degenerating and becoming barbaric. Base means cannot solve the problem, nor can they lay the foundation for freedom." Nehru and his party are scheduled to fly to Bihar today for inspection.

[United Press, Trieste, 3rd] On the eve of the four foreign ministers making a final decision on the fate of Trieste in New York, Italians here rioted again, throwing stones at pro-Yugoslav newspapers and institutions.

The riot lasted for three hours, and twelve people were arrested. No one was injured, and the Yugoslavs did not retaliate, so no major disaster occurred.

Chapter XI of the Charter outlines the principles of trusteeship, stipulating that the administering power should "recognize the principle that the interests of the inhabitants of these territories are paramount," that "acceptance of the obligation to promote to the utmost... the well-being of the inhabitants of these territories, is a sacred trust," and should "transmit regularly to the Secretary-General... statistical and other information of a technical nature relating to economic, social, and educational conditions in the territories for which they are respectively responsible."

Chapter XII stipulates the trusteeship system. The provisions are numerous, and can be briefly summarized as follows: (1) The ultimate goal of trusteeship should be "to promote the progressive development of the inhabitants of the trust territories towards self-government or independence." (2) There are three categories of territories to which the trusteeship system applies: (1) Territories now held under mandate; (2) Territories which may be detached from enemy states as a result of the Second World War; (3) Territories voluntarily placed under the system by states responsible for their administration. These three categories and the principles agreed upon at the Crimean Conference are roughly similar. (3) The terms of the trusteeship should be agreed upon by the "states directly concerned." (4) Any trusteeship agreement may designate one or more "strategic areas," and all functions relating to strategic areas should be exercised by the Security Council. The functions relating to other non-strategic areas are exercised by the General Assembly.

Chapter XIII concerns the organization of the Trusteeship Council. The members of the Council are elected by the General Assembly for a term of three years. The number of administering and non-administering members must be equally divided to ensure fairness. However, the five powers of the United States, Britain, China, the Soviet Union, and France are permanent members.

With the Charter established, the second step was that the UN Trusteeship Committee met in London from August to December 1945, and then presented its discussions at the first General Assembly of the United Nations, which convened in January of the following year. The General Assembly then passed a resolution asking the countries that formerly administered League of Nations mandates to draft conditions and methods so that the former mandated territories could be transferred to the international trusteeship system.

Now, the UN Second General Assembly has been held, and the UK has submitted the conditions for the trusteeship of Tanganyika, Togoland, and Cameroon to the UN General Assembly. The United States is also preparing to transfer the Caroline and Marshall Islands (formerly Japanese mandated territories) in the occupied Pacific to the Trusteeship Council, but stated that these islands were won by the blood and flesh of the American military, so they are unwilling to give up governance. South Africa has declared that it wants to annex Southwest Africa, which it administers under mandate. As for the Italian colonies, they have not been mentioned so far. In short, the disposition of the former League of Nations mandated territories is not difficult and should not cause much dispute, but the issue of the Italian colonies and the trusteeship of those islands in the Pacific (especially the latter) will certainly cause extremely sharp and intense disputes. Are the spirit and methods of trusteeship in the Charter just empty principles? Whether they can work depends on whether the great powers are sincere in cooperating with each other.

### Auctioning Off and Housing Panic - Ten Thousand Households Make Urgent Appeal - Requesting Security and Contentment

The Senate Resolves: Rental Rights Should Be Respected

Mayor Wu Promises: Original Tenants Can Continue to Lease

[Reported by this newspaper] Since the Central Trust Bureau, entrusted by the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau, announced the second auction of enemy and puppet real estate, tens of thousands of households have suddenly panicked about losing their homes, and have been publishing notices in newspapers to make their statements. A reporter visited the tenants of Weihai Villa on Weihaiwei Road yesterday. They said that their appeal in the newspaper was to seek security and contentment, and that they hoped the government would prioritize stability. All the tenants of the villa submitted a statement to the government with three points: First, they requested the cancellation of the auction, because the proceeds from the auction are taken from the people and used for the people, so why not cancel the auction and have the government rent the houses to the tenants? Second, if the government insists on the auction, the tenants of the villa also express their welcome. However, they hope that the buyer will purchase the property for the purpose of investment and maintain the original rental relationship. Third, if no one purchases the property because of the need to maintain the original rental relationship, the tenants are willing to work together to purchase it, but they ask the Central Trust Bureau to give them preferential prices and grant them the right of first refusal, because they are unable to compete in the auction. The main reason held by the tenants of the villa is that all residents are not enemies or puppets, and they have rented the houses since the beginning of construction. They did not rent from enemies or puppets, nor did they occupy or temporarily allocate the houses after the enemies and puppets withdrew. The government's handling methods should be different from those who occupied the houses after the victory, which would be fair.

As for the tenants of enemy properties in Dasing Lane, Dongsing Lane, Shanyin Road, Zhabu Road, and other places on Wusong Road, they also published notices separately, feeling a sense of shared fate. The Central Trust Bureau has not yet auctioned off the houses in those places. According to tenants in Dongsing Lane and other places, they petitioned the municipal government in mid-May of this year and received Mayor Wu's promise that they would have the right to continue their leases.

According to the person in charge of the real estate department of the Central Trust Bureau, the problem with this auction is not very serious. The department is entrusted to handle it and hopes that the tenants of the enemy properties can bid to purchase the properties themselves, referring to the reserve price. Currently, the real estate market is sluggish, and there are very few bidders for large lane houses. The bureau's first auction of enemy and puppet real estate included a total of seven properties, but only three were sold. As for preferential prices, the bureau believes that it cannot be done because open bidding is a principle determined by the Executive Yuan.

When the reporter went to the Handling Bureau, Shen Guanya told him about Articles 2 and 425 of the Civil Code: "Even if the lessor transfers the ownership of the leased property to a third party after the delivery of the leased property, the lease contract continues to exist for the transferee." There is also Article 425, "If the lease has a fixed term, the lease relationship expires when the term expires." The above two articles are the legal basis for resolving housing disputes after the auction. It is reported that the Handling Bureau once submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to sell enemy properties to the current residents, but the Executive Yuan approved open bidding.

Of the three houses auctioned by the Central Trust Bureau in the first auction, one on Jiaozhou Road and Connaught Road has been bid on, but because it is occupied by the original occupying agency, Executive Yuan President Song has ordered them to move out several times, and the Handling Bureau has also asked the Garrison Headquarters for assistance, but it is still occupied by the agency. Therefore, those who have money to bid on enemy and puppet real estate do not dare to try it lightly, because they are caught in this dispute, the cash is stranded, and they cannot use the house.

The Municipal Senate's Land Administration Committee held its third meeting yesterday. The Director of the Land Administration Bureau, Zhu Ping, was present. The meeting discussed five proposals:

(1) Approve the Shenbao newspaper's letter of October 21st of this year, forwarding letters from readers Guo Zidong and Zhang Binjun, making statements on housing lease matters, and requesting reference. Resolution: Regarding the housing lease dispute, the Legislative Yuan is currently drafting housing lease regulations. If there is a dispute, the parties concerned can directly apply to the competent authority or the court for handling, and the Shenbao newspaper will be informed accordingly. (2) A citizen, Yang Kuiwu, petitioned to strictly prohibit landlords from arbitrarily ordering tenants to leave the house. Resolution: Handled together with the first case. (3) A citizen, Wang Daosan, and 33 others jointly petitioned to grant the formulation of a leasing method for building land that takes both reason and emotion into account, to remedy social disputes. Resolution: The municipal government already has regulations for encouraging the construction of houses. As for the construction of houses on other people's land, it is a matter of the owner's sovereignty and should be handled in accordance with the law. (4) Approve the Land Administration Bureau's official letter of October 16th of this year, (35) Shanghai Land Qingfa No. 3218, enclosing a statistical table of public land not transferred by the former French Municipal Council, requesting investigation. Resolution: Keep the document on file for future reference. (5) Approve the Weihai Villa Tenants Association's letter of October 12th of this year, stating that the original tenants have the right to continue their leases, and requesting that enemy and puppet houses be included and uniformly applied, granting supplementary regulations. Resolution: Send a letter to the municipal government to inform the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau and the Central Trust Bureau that they should respect the rights of legal leases when auctioning enemy and puppet properties.

### Good News Amid the Housing Shortage - Many Applications for Building Permits

On the 28th of last month alone, the bureau received as many as 100 applications for building permits, and most of the building types are residential, while the building plots are mostly in the southern district.

In total, since its establishment, the bureau has liquidated materials and handed over 300 billion yuan to the national treasury.

### Zhou Fohai Shamelessly Brags - Underground Workers Sneer - Open Execution and Assassination - Complete Destruction - Hiding Radio Station is Even More Absurd

According to reports, Zhou Fohai shamelessly claimed during the second trial of Zhou Fohai by the Capital High Court on the 2nd that he had assisted and protected underground workers in many ways, such as rescuing Dai Jimin, Cheng Keqiang, and Jiang Bocheng, and that he had hidden the radio station of the central workers in his home when the Japanese were searching for radio stations most strictly. After this news was published, underground workers and people from all walks of life in Shanghai sneered at it. During Zhou's time as a puppet, he used every means to openly execute and assassinate underground workers. The so-called hiding of the radio station in his home is even more absurd. At that time, when the enemy was searching for radio stations most strictly, Zhou helped the evildoers and did everything possible to destroy them, resulting in the detection of many underground radio stations, which are all ironclad facts and known to everyone. Zhou's shameless bragging, although intended to reduce his crimes, has caused indignation among people here.

### Soldiers Riding Trains Without Tickets - Railway Bureau Plans New Measures

Adding Special Cars to All Trains

In order to avoid disturbances caused by soldiers riding trains without tickets, the Jinghu District Railway Administration has decided to add "military riding cars" to all passenger cars (except express trains) starting today, specifically for soldiers to ride. It also plans to simplify the procedures for soldiers to ride trains without paying. Detailed measures are currently being drafted and will be announced soon. As for soldiers carrying luggage and packages without tickets, there are also regulations: (1) If a soldier is neatly dressed and carries luggage without a ticket, he should pay the full fare for riding in a non-military car, and the luggage exceeding the free weight should be charged the full freight. (2) If a soldier privately carries commercial goods packages, the full freight should be charged at the arrival station. (3) Soldiers riding in the "military riding car" for free are only allowed to carry small luggage. Large luggage and packages must be paid for at the full fare and delivered to the luggage and package room for ticketing and transportation. However, luggage with a travel permit certified by the stationing military police can be transported as luggage, and the specified free weight can be deducted, but the word "military" must be noted on the luggage. In order to give preferential treatment to soldiers, the handling fee for soldiers carrying overweight luggage and packages will be waived, and the word "military" will be noted on the ticket. The above measures will be officially implemented starting today.

### Testing the Effectiveness of Wireless Radio Police Cars - Performing the Capture of Robbers - Ended in Seven Minutes

He Shang Temple, Dim Sum Shop, Greatly Startled

[Reported by this newspaper] During this winter prevention period, the Laozha Police Sub-Bureau, in order to strengthen defense and consolidate security, used the newly equipped wireless radio jeep card to test the effectiveness of catching thieves. Yesterday afternoon at around 4:00 PM, it held a capture-the-thief drill. The results were excellent and the performance was realistic. The mission was completely accomplished within seven minutes. The details of the performance are recorded as follows:

Shi Sijian, director of the Laozha Sub-Bureau, was informed yesterday afternoon at around 4:00 PM that five armed bandits had broken into the Huafeng Iron Shop at No. 237 Xiamen Road and robbed it. Shi, together with section chief Jiang Shangpei, patrol officers Zhang Ruzhong and Liu Xuexiao, first section chief Cai Chengde, more than 20 judicial section police officers, and more than 40 uniformed police officers, took two police cars, led by Shi driving a wireless radio jeep card, to the destination. They learned that one bandit, wearing a blue cloth gown and carrying a briefcase, had escaped on a rickshaw, and that there were still bandits who had fled into Yongqing Chan Temple at No. 248 on the same road. So they rushed to the temple, surrounded it, and had police detectives deployed around it. First, police officers wearing bulletproof vests bravely rushed in and captured two disguised bandits, one wearing a Zhongshan suit and the other a Western suit. They learned that there were still two bandits inside, so Shi warned the bandits on the wireless telephone, saying that if they did not surrender and come out automatically, he would order the firing of guns. As soon as he finished speaking, Shi, holding a rattan shield, followed by section chief Jiang and patrol officers Zhang and Liu, rushed in. Before long, they captured two bandits and handed them over to the police officers to be escorted back to the bureau. At the same time, the wireless radio informed the sub-bureau, and the sub-bureau called each police station to be vigilant for the fleeing bandit. Later, the wireless radio jeep card patrolled within the jurisdiction and noticed at the intersection of Fujian South Road and Zhongzheng Road that one of the bandits hiring a three-wheeled car had overturned a bicycle and fled in a panic into the Jin Hongxing Dim Sum Shop. The police officers jumped out of the jeep card and chased in, and the bandit surrendered. A loaded pistol was found on his body and taken to the bureau for interrogation. In this performance, the disguised robbers were all plainclothes police officers from the sub-bureau, including Song Jiabao, Ge Zonghao, Zhou Liansheng, Li Junkun, and Song Shaoke. This "case" started from the report received at 4:00 PM and ended at 4:07 PM, lasting only seven minutes. All five bandits were caught. The performance ended successfully. It can be seen that using wireless radio to catch thieves is very effective. It is hoped that citizens will automatically raise funds to buy more of these vehicles and donate them to various police stations, which will greatly benefit the improvement of public security.

### Discussing the Problem of the Cost of Living Index - Emergency Meeting Held Tomorrow

Since the municipal government sent personnel to publish the calculation method of the cost of living index for workers, trade unions in various industries have requested improvements to the compilation. The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions submitted this to the municipal government, and received a reply a few days ago. Except for the second item, which cancels soybeans and wheat bran and increases the quality of Wuxian rice in the food category of the index table, the rest have been submitted to relevant departments for study and adoption. Regarding the second item, the municipal government said that from the perspective of nutritional considerations, milled rice is considered to be detrimental to nutrition, and the nutritional value of brown rice is far superior to that of high-quality white rice, so the request should not be considered. The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions is scheduled to hold an emergency meeting of the members of the Cost of Living Index Research Committee at the federation's conference room at 2:00 PM tomorrow to discuss everything.

### Female Workers Can Take Leave for Childbirth - Wages Paid as Usual

A reply was received from the Municipal Social Bureau yesterday stating: The payment of wages during the maternity leave of female workers is clearly stipulated in Article 37 of the Factory Law, and each factory should handle it in accordance with the law. This wage will still be paid as usual. When workers have urgent needs for money due to weddings or funerals, they can request advance payment of wages from the factory.

### The Empress of Australia to Return to Shanghai Tomorrow, Carrying Sailors for Training in England

### Taikoo's Poyang Sails to Shanghai for the Second Time

[Our Dispatch] According to reliable information from the British Company yesterday, the Empress of Australia mail ship has already set sail from Japan back to Shanghai and is expected to arrive at the Wusongkou tomorrow. Due to the ship's large size, turning around after entering the port is difficult, so it will anchor outside the harbor. This ship is carrying 600 Chinese naval cadets to England for training, and British expatriates who had booked tickets for returning home have had their trips canceled.

Since resuming shipping after the victory, Taikoo Steamship Company has had the new ships Fuzhou and Fujian sailing to Shanghai. Now, the new ship Poyang will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow. Its size and design are similar to those of the Fuzhou and Fujian. However, this ship was built during the Anti-Japanese War and made a maiden voyage to Shanghai before the Japanese invasion of the south, after which it returned to England. This is its second time coming to Shanghai. The company also had a Poyang, a river steamer operating on the Yangtze River line, which has already been decommissioned.

Among them, 30,000 tons are barges and similar items, and 20,000 tons are heavy machinery that needs to be assembled by the CRRRA machine factory before they can be moved.

According to the CRRRA storage and transportation personnel, the last ship of surplus materials purchased by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) was unloaded in Shanghai on October 31. In the future, the post-war relief materials transported to China will be transported and processed according to the distribution plan procedures of the CRRRA and UNRRA, and the difficulties in handling are expected to decrease. In the future, the agency hopes to distribute 100,000 tons of materials per month and will strive to achieve at least this record.

### Blind Men Moving; Teahouse Adjudication; Over Robbing Business; A Blind Fight

[Our Dispatch] Sun Zhirong, a blind man, earns a living by fortune-telling and has a stall at the Xin Zha Bridge. Because business is slow, he plans to move to Caojiadu. He consulted Xie Wenbao, a fellow practitioner, who is also blind and has a fortune-telling stall at the Wujiaochang on Changning Road, where business is not bad. Xie feared that Sun would take his business, so he falsely claimed that to set up a stall at Caojiadu, one must join the local gang and worship another master. Sun did not believe him and moved his stall near Xie's, each trying to make a living. At 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd, Xie, without asking the reason, destroyed Sun's stall. The two had a verbal dispute and then agreed to have the matter adjudicated at the Xuezhaizhongyi Teahouse in western Shanghai. Both sides gathered more than ten fellow practitioners (all blind) to participate. Sun also invited four soldiers to the scene. At that time, they disagreed and went outside together, resulting in a blind fight. As a result, the police arrived and took all fourteen blind men from both sides to the Changning Branch Bureau. After interrogation, the two blind men, Sun and Xie, were each detained for three days as a warning, and the others were reprimanded and released.

### Cases of Forcible Occupation of Civilian Housing; Acceptance of Complaints Stopped; Executive Group to End Operations Within Days

Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is extremely concerned about the incidents of soldiers forcibly occupying civilian housing in the city. He recently sent General Tang Enbo to Shanghai to assist the Garrison Command in handling the crackdown. When Chairman Chiang visited Shanghai last time, he also met with Commander Xuan and inquired about the progress of the operation. He expressed his appreciation for the soldiers who understood the greater good and voluntarily withdrew. According to a reporter from the Huadong News Agency, since receiving the Chairman's handwritten instructions, the Garrison Command, together with the Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau, the Police Bureau, and the 23rd Regiment of the Military Police, formed an executive group to crack down on the forcible occupation of houses by soldiers, which started its work on September 5. Since then, it has received more than 1,500 complaint letters, of which nine-tenths have been processed. The group stopped accepting complaints from the people yesterday. There are about 30 remaining cases that have not been resolved, which are currently being expedited and are expected to be officially completed by the 10th of this month.

### Traitor Fu Xiao'an's Estate; All Confiscated; Real Estate and Goods; Immense Value

Although the puppet Shanghai Mayor Fu Xiao'an has died, his crimes of colluding with the enemy during his lifetime are obvious. The highest national defense authorities have stipulated that during the period of travel of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors, for crimes under this regulation, even if the person dies before the verdict, his entire property may still be confiscated if he is wanted and the evidence is conclusive. Therefore, the entire property of traitor Fu Xiao'an has recently been decided by the Disposal Bureau to be confiscated first and transferred to the High Prosecutor's Office for handling. It is learned that the confiscated property includes 30 Western-style houses, 52 pieces of furniture, more than 20,000 pieces of hardware, about 12 pieces of furnace steel plates, about 10 rolls of lead skin, about 48 boxes of tinplate, 300 pieces of Vanar sand, about 20 rolls of iron wire mesh, 70 pì of linen cloth, 3 tons of galvanized iron sheet, 20 boxes of galvanized iron plate, 2 tons of brass yuan, 10 bundles of steel wire rope, 3 boxes of vehicle lead, more than 18,000 shares of stock, as well as some real estate, and the Ning Shao Shipping Company, Min Fu Bank, China Asia Bank, Yongting Bank, China Exchange Bank, etc. It is heard that there is still a property that the bureau has sent personnel to investigate.

### Second Meeting of the Birthday Celebration Committee; Establishing One School in Each District; Postponing Casting of Statue

Amendment Passed in the Name of the Preparatory Committee

The Preparatory Committee of All Circles in Shanghai to Celebrate Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Sixtieth Birthday held its second preparatory committee meeting at the Municipal Council at 5:00 PM yesterday. More than 30 people attended, including Wu Guozhen, Pan Gongzhan, Wu Kaixian, Xuan Tiewu, Xu Jikui, Shui Xiangyun, Xi Yushu, Zhou Feicheng, Wang Zhuyi, Zhang Xiaosong, and Xiang Changquan. The meeting was chaired by Pan Gongzhan, and after the opening ceremony, various issues were discussed. First, Wu Kaixian proposed that since the Chairman's birthday has passed, the name of the committee needs to be amended. Everyone agreed to cancel the word "Preparatory" and amend it to the Shanghai All Circles Committee to Celebrate Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Sixtieth Birthday. Then, the proposals were discussed: (1) How to proceed with the donation of schools from all circles in the city. Wu Kaixian suggested that at least one school should be established in each district, and the school site should be slightly expanded. It is proposed to set up the district office in the school and build a larger auditorium for the district people's representatives to hold meetings. The school equipment should also be complete to form a district people's central primary school. It was unanimously passed, and it was decided to invite the Civil Affairs Bureau to convene a joint meeting of district chiefs. The secretary-general and standing committee members of this committee should also participate in the meeting, and the specific measures should be discussed in the meeting. (2) The finance group plans to send the collection method and receipt style for review. After discussion, it was decided that the committee would designate a bank to collect on its behalf. The specific collection method and receipt style should be discussed in a joint meeting organized by the secretary-general, standing committee members, and district chiefs. (3) How to share the various expenses of the birthday celebration among the participating groups. Mayor Wu suggested that half of the expenses should be borne by the municipal government and half by larger groups, such as the Chamber of Commerce, the Labor Union, the Banking Association, the Money Industry Association, the Six District Cotton Textile Industry Association, and the Four District Flour Industry Association. The resolution was passed. Afterwards, there was a temporary motion regarding whether the casting of the Chairman's bronze statue should be actively carried out. It was generally believed that the Chairman had explicitly prohibited the casting of bronze statues, so it was not convenient to actively implement it. It was either handed over to the second meeting of the Municipal Council for discussion before a decision was made, or it was decided to temporarily hold the casting of the Chairman's bronze statue. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM.

### Tang Shoumin's Case Remanded for Retrial; Claims Purchase of Cloth Was for the People; Yuan Liang Testifies, Providing Favorable Evidence

[Our Dispatch] The case of Tang Shoumin, who was formerly the chairman of the Puppet Business Control Association, was previously sentenced to life imprisonment by the Municipal High Court. The defendant refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the Supreme Court for review. On September 13 of this year, Zhou Yunhui, the presiding judge of the Fifth Court of the Supreme Court, ruled to revoke the original judgment and remand the case for retrial. The reasons for this were: (1) The original trial did not mention that the purchase of cloth was for the people; (2) Tang was captured and came to Shanghai, not willingly; (3) The original trial did not mention favorable evidence of participating in the Anti-Japanese War. The judgment was sent to the Municipal High Court in October, and yesterday afternoon, the retrial was opened and two witnesses, Yuan Liang and Lin Kanghou, were summoned.

[Caption: Tang Shoumin Under Interrogation (China News Agency Photo)]

Tang was wearing a gray flannel robe with round-toe leather shoes. He had short, graying hair. He stated: "I am 55 years old, from Zhenjiang. I was formerly the general manager of the Bank of Communications. When the Pacific War broke out, I was in Kowloon. When Kowloon fell, I was captured by the Japanese gendarmerie. On April 15, 1942, I was sent back to Shanghai by plane. At that time, the puppet government invited me to participate in political activities, which I resolutely refused. The puppet Ministry of Finance appointed me as the chairman of the puppet Bank of Communications. The China and Communications Banks were reopened on the same day, but this matter was rumored in Hong Kong long ago and was not planned and prepared by the defendant. The organization of the Puppet National Business Control Association was initiated because prices in Shanghai at that time were very high, and the people were living in poverty. Without control, it would be impossible to suppress prices. Therefore, Mei Shiping, the puppet Minister of Industry, came to Shanghai to convene leaders from all walks of life to discuss and designated 20 people as the founders of the association, and then elected directors and supervisors. From March 15, 1943, to the end of June 1944, the defendant served as the chairman of the association. At that time, the enemy and puppets purchased cloth, covering a wide range of areas in the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and did not pay cash but instead used notes. The defendant strongly opposed this. The puppet government later handed this matter over to the Business Control Association, and I had no choice but to put forward several points for the benefit of the merchants: (1) Reduce the scope of purchase, limiting it to Shanghai only, and allowing freedom in other places; (2) Pay cash for cloth, half in gold and half in Central Reserve Certificates, with the price of gold calculated at half the market price; (3) Japanese merchants' cloth should be purchased in the same way as Chinese merchants'." The defendant spent a lot of effort on this, but how could the Japanese be willing to hand over the

gold?

The defendant then threatened that if the "Greater East Asia War" were victorious and the United States failed, and the gold standard were broken, then gold would be worthless. Therefore, if they were unwilling to release the gold, it meant that they were confident that they could not win. As a result, the Japanese could not refute it and took out more than 20 tons of gold. The large amount of gold stored in the "Central Reserve Bank" that the National Army received after the victory came from this. The defendant was also afraid that the enemy and puppets would use tricks again and, after taking out the gold, would order the gold to be nationalized in the future. Therefore, I inquired with the puppet Ministry of Finance whether free trade was allowed. The reply was yes. The defendant then transferred this reply to the puppet municipal government to announce to the people and, at the same time, as the spokesman of the Business Control Association, gave a speech in the newspaper. This was also a great effort. In addition, it was stipulated that 13 categories, such as locally woven cloth, would be exempt from purchase. The puppet government also ordered the Business Control Association to set up inspection stations at the railway station and in the suburbs to prevent smuggling, but I did not comply with it. All of this was for the benefit of the merchants."

Yuan Liang Testifies

The interrogation came to an end at this point, followed by the questioning of witnesses. Yuan Liang, the former mayor of Beiping, stated: "I am 64 years old, from Hangzhou. On January 17, 1938, I was summoned to Hankou by telegram by Chairman Chiang and appointed to preside over intelligence work in Shanghai. I arrived in Shanghai in February and started working. I knew Tang before, but we were not close. In 1943, Tang returned from Hong Kong. In April 1944, the government issued an order for important economic intelligence, so I told Tang to collect information on finance, industry, and commerce and prepare a report, which Xu Yanshen took to Chongqing. On the way, he encountered the Zhejiang-Jiangxi War and handed the letter to Chiang Ching-kuo in Ganzhou, who then sent it to Chongqing by plane. Later, Xu returned to Shanghai in September. The second report was taken to Chongqing by Yin Tiyang via Bengbu. I also attached

letters from Chairman Chiang, Zhang Yuejun, Kong Xiangxi, and Xiong Shihui. In January 1945, when Yin returned to Shanghai, he brought a letter from Zhang Yuejun, in which the Chairman instructed us to maintain the situation if there was a food shortage in Shanghai. Therefore, I had a secret organization with nine departments, two of which, transportation and materials, were in charge of Tang, to maintain order and solve various problems in case the enemy withdrew. The military intelligence was collected by myself, and the economic intelligence was mostly provided by Tang."

Interrogation of Lin Kanghou's Capture in Hong Kong

Lin Kanghou, who was in custody, stated: "I am 71 years old, from Shanghai. When the Pacific War broke out, I was in Kowloon. Later, Tang and others were imprisoned by the Japanese in the Peninsula Hotel, and then transferred to the Hong Kong Hotel. Li Sihao, Yan Zhongqing, Zhou Zuomin, and others were all together. On April 15, 1942, I was sent back to Shanghai by special plane." The defendant's defense lawyer also submitted a certificate from Li Sihao, which stated the same as Lin Kanghou's statement. The defense lawyer also asked the court to summon Zhang Ziqi, the current deputy mayor of Tianjin, to testify and prove that the defendant provided intelligence. The court ordered that a decision be made after consideration whether to summon the witness. The case was adjourned for further interrogation, and the defendant was returned to custody.

### Pseudo-Warden Abets Tyranny: Shen Guanquan Sentenced to Ten Years for Treason

Xu Quanyuan Sentenced to One and a Half Years

(Our Report) Shen Guanquan, the pseudo-warden of Shanghai Prison, was reported after the victory for having mobilized hundreds of prisoners during his tenure to build military defense works for the enemy on Sijiao Mountain outside Ningbo. Many of these prisoners died due to unbearable torture, and those who survived were mostly crippled by illness. Shen also stole and sold a large quantity of paper, copper blocks, gray felt, and other materials from the prison to enrich his own pockets. The case was previously tried by the High Court, and yesterday morning the defendant was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment. Xu Quanyuan, the head of the prison's work section, was also suspected of conspiring to steal and was sentenced to imprisonment.

### President of Dazhong Evening News, Weng ShuaiPing, Dies of Illness, Composes His Own Funeral Couplet Before Death

[Our Report] Mr. Weng ShuaiPing, publisher and president of the Dazhong Evening News, passed away at his residence on Diswei Road at 10:00 AM yesterday at the age of forty-six. The funeral will be held at the Shanghai Funeral Home on Xujiahui Road at 3:00 PM this afternoon. When critically ill, he composed his own funeral couplet in bed: "During the War of Resistance, I also ventured into danger and difficulty, not dying at the hands of the enemy or the puppet regime, joyfully celebrating victory. Writing the resumption speech and the founding speech again was extremely laborious; dying of illness, death is also something that can close my eyes in peace. A mayfly in the universe, strive to think of acting righteously and establishing oneself, unskilled in seeking and striving, mediocre and without expression. Only the public writings and heavenly writings remain, waiting for future generations to judge; my wishes are fulfilled, life is originally limited." The Dazhong Evening News was renamed from the Da Ying Evening News, so the couplet contains the words "resumption speech and founding speech."

### Renovation of the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou Highway Planned to Rebuild Permanent Bridges, Requires a Budget of 60 Billion Yuan at Current Prices

[Our Report] Mr. Su Shaosong, Director of the First District Highway Engineering Administration of the Highway Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, recently came to Shanghai from Nanjing with the head of the branch of the Administration to inspect the situation of the Shanghai-Nanjing, Shanghai-Hangzhou and Nanjing-Hangzhou Highways. Since the first day of this month, the Bureau has set up three engineering branches in Shanghai, Hangzhou and Nanjing respectively, responsible for each section of the highway. At present, both the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou highways are barely passable in good weather, but impassable in rainy weather. As for the Shanghai-Nanjing line, it only extended to Wuxi before the war, and currently only extends to Changshu. The bureau plans to repair the Xiyi Road, and in the future, traffic from Shanghai to Nanjing will detour through Yixing. Wuxi-Jurong will not be repaired for the time being. The wartime losses of the above three major highways were extremely heavy, especially the destruction of bridges. The Highway Bureau plans to rebuild permanent bridges with a load capacity of 20 tons. The Shanghai-Nanjing Road is planned to be paved with Class A pavement, with a roadbed 12 meters wide and a road surface 9 feet wide. The intersections between highways or between highways and railways are all grade-separated, in order to completely avoid traffic accidents. The so-called grade separation means that the intersections are either raised like bridges or underground tunnels. Once this type of Class A road surface is completed, cars can travel at 100 kilometers per hour. The bureau plans to complete it by the end of next year, but according to the current price budget, it already requires 60 billion. Therefore, when it will be completed depends entirely on funding. If there is not enough money, it is difficult to say whether it will be completed in two or three years.

### Reader Consultation, Legal Questions

Selling Stolen Property

Cao Bin asks: My family has two ancestral houses. One house (House A) is owned by my father, and one house (House B) is owned by my uncle. Because my uncle died early and his children were still young, the house was managed by my father. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japan in the 26th year of the Republic, I joined the army to serve the country. After returning home after the victory, I learned that both houses had been sold by my father. When the transaction was made, it was stated that if the houses were not completely vacated within a time limit, a certain amount would be deducted from the sale proceeds as a mortgage. Now the houses have long been vacated, but the buyer still refuses to return the money. I have several legal questions, please answer them. (1) Can the sale made by a family member during the War of Resistance without my consent be declared invalid? (2) House B is owned by my uncle. Is it legal for my father to sell it? Can it be recovered? (3) Is it illegal to refuse to return the deposit after the houses have been vacated? What should be done?

[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] (1) All sales contracts during the War of Resistance are valid unless there is evidence of reliance on enemy or puppet forces. (2) It is naturally invalid to sell other people’s property. (3) In the absence of a special agreement, the retained amount can be recovered.

Enticing a Female Student

Wang Gang asks: I was engaged to a Miss So and So in the 30th year of the Republic. Later, because she entered a certain school to study, we did not officially marry. In the 32nd year, I also felt that my academic ability was insufficient and entered a school in the rear to study. Since the engagement, the relationship between the two parties has been harmonious. Unexpectedly, after I went to the rear, Miss So and So was seduced by the principal of the school and had a cohabitation relationship for several months, and gave birth to a boy in a certain place. After I returned, Miss So and So, knowing that she should not have an affair with a married man, reunited with me and confessed all the past facts after the marriage. I am very angry after hearing this. May I ask what legal responsibilities the principal and Miss So and So should bear? What is the procedure for filing a complaint? Please answer.

[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] Since Miss So and So was able to realize that she should not have had an affair with a married man before marriage and confessed frankly, she has been able to correct her mistakes and start anew. You should be especially lenient. Although Miss So and So can file a complaint with the court against the principal for "enticement" and other crimes, it is of no practical benefit to you.

### After Flour Price is Agreed, Wheat Rises and Electricity Bills Increase, Flour Mills are Dilemma, Government Tries to Promote Import of Foreign Wheat

[Our Report] According to flour industry sources, the flour mills in the city were once shut down due to lack of raw materials. Although they have resumed work, the operation depends entirely on whether wheat can be obtained and work stops intermittently. It is understood that when Mayor Wu convened the flour industry to agree on the new price of flour, the market price of wheat per dan was only 27,000 yuan, while the ex-factory price of flour per bag was agreed at 19,000 yuan. Recently, the price of wheat per dan has risen to 32,000 yuan, and the price of electricity for factories has increased to 180 yuan per degree since November 1st. Therefore, flour mills will lose money if they produce flour at the newly agreed price. It is also said that wheat is prohibited from being exported, limited to the city only. In fact, the wheat reserves in the city were already very low before the ban was implemented. However, the export of wheat is not prohibited in Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Zhenjiang and other places. It is estimated that the current cost of transporting wheat from Suzhou and Wuxi to the city is 31,500 yuan, which is almost the same as the market price in the city. Therefore, wheat from all producing areas is transported to areas with higher wheat prices. In order to produce a large amount of flour, factories are bound to go to the producing areas to search for it themselves. It is said that the government is still actively trying to transport 100,000 tons of foreign wheat to China as soon as possible.

### Rice Market Weak, Oil Prices Strong

The rice market is digesting loosely, with more than 12,000 stones of various goods registered. Southern japonica rice continued to drop slightly by 1,000 yuan, northern japonica rice was high but the secondary price was cut, and the yangdu indica rice was slightly weak, dropping by 300 to 500 yuan. The passenger indica and port indica rice also became soft. White glutinous rice was the most sluggish in sales, declining steadily. The high-priced yellow glutinous rice was average, and the medium and secondary prices were stagnant. Bean oil factories picked up cleverly, but the Shantou and Quanzhou prices were unchanged, and the situation became weak and fell slightly. Red beans fell by another 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Wine shops are reluctant to buy red sorghum. Due to the high transportation costs from the producing areas, buyers are unwilling to purchase, and prices have risen by 300 to 500 yuan. Corn is scarce, and the price has risen by 300 to 500 yuan. Wheat bran has dropped by 100 yuan. There are not many transactions of soybean cake in Shantou and Xiamen. Raw peanuts are sold as they arrive, and the high and secondary prices are similar. However, the retail sales in the central area have cleared, and the price has increased by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. There are few sesame seeds arriving, and the Guangbang are idle, and the price has risen by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Oil prices are still strong.

### Oil Extraction Industry Holds Meeting

The Oil Extraction Industry Association held a meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday, presided over by Li Zuhua of Dade Xin. Representatives from oil factories such as Zhongzhi, Dayouyu, Dachangxin, Changde, Dasheng, and Shunyu attended the meeting. Resolutions were made on the spot: (1) Because the stock is not much, the 900 dan of edible oil required by the Logistics Department will be changed to 500 dan, which will be borne by each factory separately. (2) The Social Affairs Bureau will be invited to participate in the next meeting to understand the current cost and expenses of each factory and the actual situation of production difficulties, and to take more effective measures.

### Subsidized Flour Distribution Begins, Non-Members Cause Trouble

The City’s Cake and Bun Industry, Cut Noodle Industry, Biscuit Industry, and other associations, under the order of the Municipal Government, handled the distribution of subsidized flour to the industry. Starting from the 4th, all members of each industry registered and stamped at their respective associations. The associations issued flour distribution certificates, and the certificate holders paid and received flour at the designated flour shops. It is learned that the Cake and Bun Industry Association has a total of 2,279 members. With the approval of the Municipal Government, 3,574 bags of subsidized flour were issued, and each household could receive one to two bags. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning, several non-members of the industry such as Qiu ChengSong and Shi WeiRen did not register with the Cake and Bun Industry Association in advance, so they failed to obtain flour. They directly requested distribution from the Municipal Government, causing misunderstanding. Mayor Wu convened Zhang Guanshou of the Cake and Bun Industry Association to inquire about the reasons. It was learned that Qiu ChengSong and others did not join the association according to the law, so they did not receive the flour distribution. Mayor Wu instructed Qiu ChengSong and others to join the association as members before they could apply for flour distribution. According to Zhang Guanshou, the person in charge of the Cake and Bun Industry, the association is ordered to distribute subsidized flour to the industry, limited to members and those who have a joint guarantee, so as to comply with laws and regulations.

### Wang Zhixin Requests to Return to Shanghai, Stock Exchange Business Can be Developed

Wang Zhixin, the concurrent acting general manager of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, went to Nanjing on the 31st of last month to attend the annual meeting of the China Economic Construction Association. It is heard that he also met with relevant authorities to inquire about the business of the exchange. Mr. Wang returned to Shanghai this morning. The reporter specifically inquired with the person in charge of the exchange. It is said that when Mr. Wang was in Nanjing, he met with the relevant authorities of the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance and Economics separately, and conveyed the difficulties of the exchange's brokers and their hopes and opinions. The authorities expressed their understanding and sympathy, and the negotiations went smoothly. The exchange is now waiting for government instructions.

It is also rumored that deferred settlement is expected to be seen this week, but the stocks that can be opened for deferred settlement will be limited to a small part of the currently listed stocks.

### Bond Market Turns Up Before Close

The bond market was initially weak and then stable. People's hearts were stimulated by the short squeeze in the stock market and became active. The most open price of the Unified C bond was around 1,510 yuan, and it once dropped to 1,420 yuan. After hovering, the stock market recovered, and the buying spree suddenly flourished. It gradually rose, and struggled to rise to around 1,700 yuan before closing. As a result, it rose 140 yuan compared with the previous close. Due to time constraints, miscellaneous brands such as A and B were still slightly higher by 30 yuan to 50 yuan. After the close, everyone was scrambling to buy.

### Large Batch of American Flour Imported

[Our Report] The Jielinjie Pilis Spike, an agent of Jardine Matheson's Foreign Department, arrived in port last Saturday. It transported more than 139,670 bags of flour from Vancouver and more than 18,180 pine logs, totaling more than 112,360 feet. It berthed at buoys No. 5 and No. 6 for unloading. It is heard that part of the flour is relief supplies, and the rest was purchased by the Central Trust Bureau. Most of the pine wood belongs to Baolong Foreign Company.

### Yarn Market Improvement: 5,600 Bundles of Yarn Allocated; Replicated Products Lack Cost Basis and Face a Dim Future; Black Market Gradually Vanishing Due to Increased Supply

[Our Report] Yesterday, the yarn market continued to stabilize. The allocation quotas from various factories were supplied steadily, creating a lively atmosphere. Traders were also very eager to purchase, but these were mostly futures orders, far from meeting the needs of buyers. Therefore, the spot price on the market was 100,000 to 200,000 higher than the official price. However, those seeking immediate supply were still happy to accept it, indicating actual sales. The price of 20-count yarns of various brands was 30,000 to 40,000 better than last weekend. In particular, Double Horse yarn rose again to 2.14 million. The sales of 40-count double-ply yarn were relatively sluggish, with no price improvement.

Details of Yarn Allocation

The first yarn allocation of the third period by the Six Districts Cotton Spinning Association took place yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m. The compiled allocation list from various yarn factories was handed over to the Yarn Allocation Committee of the Cotton Yarn Replicated Products Association. The content included: 57 bundles of 6-count yarn, 500 bundles of 10-count yarn, 10 bundles of 12-count yarn, 561 bundles of 16-count yarn, 3,142 bundles of 20-count yarn, 15 bundles of 23-count yarn, 484 bundles of 32-count yarn, 130 bundles of 32-count double-ply yarn, 61 bundles of 40-count yarn, 430 bundles of 42-count double-ply yarn, 12 bundles of 60-count double-ply yarn, 10 bundles of 64-count double-ply yarn, and 10 bundles of 80-count double-ply yarn, 4.25 bundles of 80-count six-ply yarn, totaling 5,626.25 bundles. Compared with the needs of the Cotton Yarn Replicated Products Association, the quantity of coarse yarn below 16-count was significantly excessive, while 42-count double-ply yarn and 32-count double-ply yarn were in severe shortage. The handling authorities felt quite perplexed. However, the supply of 20-count common yarn was close to the demand, according to sources from the Cotton Yarn Replicated Products Association.

Allocation from Textile Construction

Among them, the allocation from Textile Construction was 400 bundles of 20-count yarn, 310 bundles of 32-count yarn, 100 bundles of 32-count double-ply yarn, 400 bundles of 42-count double-ply yarn, 12 bundles of 60-count double-ply yarn, 10 bundles of 80-count double-ply yarn, and 4.25 bundles of 80-count six-ply yarn. The quality of these goods was more suitable. The allocation price was still based on 1.75 million for 20-count yarn as the standard. The allocation prices for coarse and fine yarns were calculated according to the prices previously set by the Textile Management Committee. The allocation standard for various Replicated Products Associations this time was still based on the initial registry from the first allocation. Those who did not participate in the valley factories will wait for the next allocation. The Replicated Products Association considered the previous allocation of yarn from the factories, regardless of the count or thickness, to be inappropriate.

Discretionary Return of Coarse Yarn

It was decided to return the unsuitable 10-count and 12-count yarns in appropriate quantities. According to Pan Shihao, the director of the Replicated Products Association, during this period of insufficient production, the various replicated product manufacturers should make appropriate adjustments. At the same time, it is hoped that the yarn factories can also consider the practical difficulties when matching allocations. This partial return of goods is truly a last resort. Pan also pointed out that the current market is sluggish, and the selling prices of fabrics and various cotton yarn replicated products are already below cost. If the weather does not turn cooler and the monetary situation does not ease, many factories in the replicated products industry will suspend operations. The enthusiasm for this yarn allocation will probably not be as high as last time. Pan expressed satisfaction with the recent direct opening of goods by the yarn factories according to the allocation price and the gradual elimination of the black market in the yarn market.

Yarn Prices Expected to Decrease

Pan also predicted that yarn prices might decrease further. He advised the industry not to rush to compete for allocation. According to observations by influential figures in the cotton yarn replicated products industry, the recent decrease in yarn prices is actually due to the fact that after the yarn allocation, factories no longer need to search for goods on the black market. The decrease in practical demand is also an undeniable fact.

The six industry associations under the Replicated Products Association system completed the allocation based on the factory orders last night, by association units. Here are the detailed numbers:

Allocation Numbers for Each Industry

1. Towel and Blanket Industry: 210 bundles of 16-count yarn, 136 bundles of 20-count yarn, 30 bundles of 32-count yarn, 9 bundles of 42-count double-ply yarn. 2. Underwear Weaving Industry: 302 bundles of 20-count yarn, 76 bundles of 32-count yarn, 7 bundles of 40-count yarn. 3. Handkerchief Weaving Industry: 17 bundles of 32-count yarn, 12 bundles of 40-count yarn, 1 bundle of 80-count double-ply yarn. 4. Handmade Cotton Weaving Industry: 30 bundles of 16-count yarn, 152 bundles of 20-count yarn, 10 bundles of 32-count yarn, 3 bundles of 40-count yarn, 19 bundles of 42-count double-ply yarn. 5. Knitting Industry: 10 bundles of 12-count yarn, 240 bundles of 16-count yarn, 118 bundles of 20-count yarn, 80 bundles of 32-count double-ply yarn, 27 bundles of 40-count yarn, 102 bundles of 42-count double-ply yarn, 12 bundles of 60-count double-ply yarn, 10 bundles of 64-count double-ply yarn, 9 bundles of 80-count double-ply yarn. 6. Machine Dyeing and Weaving Industry: 81 bundles of 16-count yarn, 2,449 bundles of 20-count yarn, 271 bundles of 32-count yarn, 50 bundles of 32-count double-ply yarn, 132 bundles of 40-count yarn, 300 bundles of 42-count double-ply yarn, 4.25 bundles of 80-count six-ply yarn. The 10-count yarn among them, due to its unsuitability, has not yet been allocated.

Fabric Prices Decline Again

The fabric market still shows no improvement. Transactions remain sluggish, and prices have declined by another 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. On Saturday, Textile Construction's 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was quoted at only 78,000 yuan, while the spot price was 80,000 yuan. Actual sales in this district were scarce, and general users are also taking a wait-and-see attitude. If the weather does not turn colder, the fabric market will be difficult to improve.

### Convenient Settlement Imminent; Lively Conditions in the Chinese Stock Market

The Chinese stock market on the previous day still felt the economic panic. There were many sellers with remaining shares, resulting in further declines. Later, with the imminent implementation of convenient settlement, off-market short covering was urgent, causing a rebound. From noon onwards, a short squeeze formed. The opening prices in the morning were not favorable. Except for Qinxing, all stocks showed small declines. After the opening, there was a liquidation of remaining shares, resulting in a sudden and sharp drop. Yongsha fell to 613 yuan, Meiya to 2,680 yuan, Xinhe to 253 yuan, Jingfu to 190 yuan, Xinguang to 205 yuan, and Qinxing to 135 yuan. Afterwards, short positions were covered, and with the repeated buying by No. 176, the situation stabilized. Later, with No. 89, No. 189, and No. 154 also gradually absorbing, the situation rebounded. After 10:30 a.m., rumors spread in the market that deferred settlement would be introduced and announced that day, and implemented within the day. Investor sentiment turned positive, and off-market transactions were mostly short covering. As a result, buying interest increased, and prices rose again and again, reaching high prices at noon. Then, profit-taking emerged, and the market turned sideways. Compared to the previous Saturday, among the popular stocks, Yongsha rose by 3%, Xinhe improved by a strong 0.5%, Meiya, Jingfu, and Xinguang each improved by 8%, and Qinxing, due to its low price, rose by 9%. Cold stocks like Datong, Rongfeng, Match, Xinya, Lianan, Jinglun, and Underwear showed little change. The rest rose by 0.5% to 1%. In the afternoon, the market continued to be lively, but after profit-takers emerged at high prices, it leveled off. As a result, powerful institutions like No. 89 and No. 176 increased pressure, and the situation turned tired again. However, bargain hunting created a back-and-forth pattern. As a result, compared to the previous Saturday, Yongsha rose slightly, Xinhe rose by 4%, and Meiya, Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing each rose by about 0.5%. Among the cold stocks, Zhongfang rose by slightly less than 10%, and Huafeng, Underwear, Yonggong, and Tongyi each improved by about 0.5%. The rest lacked special changes. The trading volume was 13.74 million shares. Off-market stocks were generally stable.

Foreign stocks buyers chose stocks that had hopes of being listed in Hong Kong, resulting in slight variations among the stocks. Initially flat, then lively, the results compared to last Saturday showed Yeguang slightly down, while the rest rose by 0.5% to 1%.

### Tax Bureau Cracks Down on Tax Evasion and Private Cigarettes; Manages Handmade Cigarette Factories

[Our Report] The Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance recently noted that handmade cigarette factories have been established in various parts of the country, but most of them cannot pay taxes according to regulations. Therefore, private handmade cigarettes are flooding everywhere, not only affecting national tax revenue but also hindering the interests of legitimate cigarette factories. Therefore, the "Measures for the Management of Handmade Cigarette Factories" have been promulgated for implementation by local commodity tax bureaus. All handmade cigarette factories should first raise funds to establish companies in accordance with the Company Law, equip themselves with wooden or small iron machines, and apply for registration with the Tax Bureau. Those who cannot establish companies should first organize handmade cigarette industry production and marketing cooperatives in accordance with the Cooperative Law and apply for registration with the Tax Bureau. Existing family-run handmade cigarette households are temporarily allowed to apply for temporary registration with the local commodity tax bureau. The registration period is limited to three months. Handmade cigarettes produced by temporarily registered handmade cigarette households do not use brand names or trademarks, but should print the mark "Recorded by XX in XX Place" on the cigarettes and are limited to local sales and are not allowed to be transported and sold to other places. The validity period is limited to one year. After the expiration, they may not manufacture or sell cigarettes again unless they are organized into companies or cooperatives. The monthly cigarette production quantity is 250,000 cigarettes for handmade cigarette factories and 50,000 cigarettes for handmade cigarette households. Those who use locally made cigarette paper should first submit samples to the Tax Bureau for approval for temporary trial use. Those who purchase imported cigarette paper should comply with the regulations on the purchase and transportation of cigarette paper. Hand-made cigarettes that have been manufactured, if not packed in boxes, are allowed to pay taxes per strip (500 cigarettes) and affix stamps before leaving the factory. Factory-made hand-made cigarettes that have been affixed with strip stamps, if they are to be packed into whole boxes for transportation and sales, should temporarily report to the tax authorities for inspection, and the inspection stamp cargo certificate should be affixed to the boxes before they can be transported. After arriving at the designated sales location, they should also report to the local tax authorities to remove the inspection stamp cargo certificate box by box. At the same time, it is stipulated that handmade cigarette manufacturers should first find ways to purchase machines and switch to machine production, and the competent commodity tax authorities should supervise the handling at any time.

### China Trust Continues to Allocate; Rayon Black Market Declines

[Our Report] The Central Trust Bureau continued to sell rayon yesterday. The listed price for 120 Bright Golden Three Horses was still 2.78 million yuan. The Silk Weaving Industry Association stated that a total of 223 rayon openers applied, with a total application amount of 465 boxes. However, as of last night, the approved amount had not yet been determined.

Yesterday, 120 Bright Rayon on the Tianqiao market was quoted at 3.45 million to 500,000 yuan in the morning, but there were no transactions. The asking price for new goods was 3.05 million yuan. In the afternoon, people inquired, so the price was raised again. Old goods were quoted at 550,000 yuan, and new goods were quoted at 100,000 yuan, both of which were 50,000 to 60,000 yuan higher than last weekend. 120 Semi-Gloss on the Tianqiao market was only quoted at 2.95 million yuan up and down, and the asking price was 100,000 yuan in the afternoon, which was the same as last week. 150 Bright and 75 Semi-Gloss were slightly sluggish in the morning, but rebounded in the afternoon. The prices were the same as last weekend with no changes.

### Recently Invented Man-Made Textile Raw Materials

The British parent company of Bu Neimen, a British company in this city, recently announced an important invention in the field of man-made fibers in conjunction with the Printing Industry Association of Manchester. This new product, named Terylen, is the crystallization of the efforts of printing industry experts during the war. It is still under discussion and is very different from the existing natural and man-made fibers. Its features include: (1) extremely strong toughness, (2) less likely to change under high heat and intense light compared to other fibers, (3) extremely easy to machine and hand weave, (4) its thickness and length can be arbitrarily manufactured within a wide range, (5) its fiber properties can also vary with the manufacturing method to suit various needs. When woven into clothing, it does not require as much care in washing, laundering, and ironing as ordinary clothing.

### Crossings on Bank Drafts and Bills of Exchange: Ministry of Finance Considers Them Inappropriate

Bank drafts and bills of exchange issued by banks and money shops have traditionally been crossed or specially crossed, and are limited to payment by banks and money shops. Recently, the Ministry of Finance explained that because there are no such provisions in the Negotiable Instruments Law, and in accordance with Article 9 of the Negotiable Instruments Law, "Matters not prescribed by this law and recorded on a negotiable instrument shall have no effect under the Negotiable Instruments Law." National banks and bureaus have been practicing this habit for a long time. Once it is changed, it will be very difficult. Relevant business personnel from various banks and bureaus held a meeting yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m. in the conference room on the third floor of the Jiaotong Bank to study the solution. After more than an hour of discussion, the result was that some bank drafts and bills of exchange will be replaced by the bank's own checks, and the endorsement method prohibiting transfer will be used to remedy the situation.

### Recent Situation of International Silk Textile Company

International Silk Textile Company specializes in the wholesale and retail of domestic and foreign silk, especially the wholesale and retail of Indian silk. Since Chairman Yang Yinpou and General Manager Zhang Yusheng took charge, the company's business has been developing day by day. Recently, due to business expansion, the original location on Guizhou Road was no longer sufficient, and the office was moved to the new address at No. 34 Hankou Road, Fuda Building.

### Gold Market Buyers Enthusiastic; Foreign Currencies: US Dollar Rises, Hong Kong Dollar Falls

Yesterday, investor sentiment recovered. The opening price in the morning was 2.335 million yuan, and the market was generally stable at around 2.33 million yuan. Later, with the renewed optimistic view, demand gradually exceeded supply, and the market rose in spirals. After 10 a.m., the Central Bank allocated 300 bars at a price of 2.3425 million yuan. The Central Bank's supply was not smooth, and buyers were even more eager. Near noon, it once rebounded to above 2.36 million yuan before stabilizing slightly, struggling at around 2.355 million yuan at noon. In the afternoon, next-day delivery was pushed up to around 2.375 million yuan, resulting in an increase of 40,000 yuan compared to the previous Saturday. Gold jewelry was listed as high as 250,000 yuan. Refined silver was stable, while silver dollars were slightly higher. The underground lending rate was still stable at around 1.5%.

Foreign currencies initially weakened but then stabilized. The US dollar was around 4,050 yuan in the early morning, but later rose to 4,150 yuan near noon due to the booming gold market, continuing to rise slightly compared to the previous Saturday. The Hong Kong dollar was dragged down by telegraphic transfers and lacked sales, falling as low as around 870 yuan before stabilizing. As a result, it fell another 10 yuan compared to the previous Saturday. The Hong Kong exchange rate rose to 114.25 yuan due to the Shanghai telegraphic rate, and the local outward remittance market was sluggish. Yesterday, 870 yuan was for sale with little demand. The Indian rupee was at 1,065 yuan with supply, and the British pound at 14,100 yuan also lacked support. There were not many transactions. The listed price of the US dollar did not change, but internal transactions

### Simplifying Existing Education Regulations; Ministry of Education Plans to Improve Administrative Efficiency; Currently Being Conducted Under the Auspices of the Counselor's Office

[Report from Nanjing, April 4] The Ministry of Education believes that many education regulations were promulgated before and during the war. After the victory, many rules and regulations were also formulated and promulgated for educational restoration and emerging educational undertakings. It is not easy to inspect them all at once. It is now planned to simplify all existing education regulations, eliminating the complex and retaining the essential, so that the inspection aspect can save time, thereby improving the efficiency of education administration. It is reported that the counselor's office of the Ministry of Education is in charge, and specially designated responsible personnel from various departments have been invited to participate, so that they can allocate a small amount of office time each day to consult and reorganize, and simplify all existing education regulations at all levels as much as possible.

### Expanded Memorial Week for Educational Personnel in Beijing; Minister of Education Zhu Attends to Give Instructions

[Report from Nanjing, April 3] The Nanjing Municipal Education Bureau held an expanded memorial week for educational workers in Nanjing City at 9 a.m. on the morning of the 3rd at the Dahua Theater. Minister Zhu and Mayor Ma were invited to attend and give instructions. More than 1,000 teachers and staff members from primary and secondary schools and social education institutions in Beijing City attended and performed the rituals. First, the director of the Municipal Education Bureau reported that holding an expanded memorial week and inviting celebrities from the education circle to give instructions was the first decision, and it will be held from time to time in the future. After the speech, Minister Zhu took the stage to give instructions, first saying that the difficult lives of teachers were the same in European and American countries. However, at the time of China's victory and restoration, due to various reasons, the vitality of the people has not recovered, and the national expenditure is huge. The education sector has received limited funds and has not been able to reach the standard. Therefore, the treatment of education personnel is even more meager. In the future, it will be improved and enhanced with the stability of the political situation. He then said that the academic atmosphere is not ideal enough and should be rectified urgently. In terms of teachers, do not regard teaching books as fulfilling their responsibilities, but enrich the content of teaching, so that students feel interested, and guide students, especially with personal example. In terms of students, they should strive to change the habit of being arrogant and have a psychology of respecting teachers and valuing the way. In terms of administration, economics must be absolutely open, and the minimum standard of cleanliness and order in the New Life Movement must be achieved. Due to the war, students in national schools are mostly treated with public funds, and some students think that everything should be enjoyed, and even make all kinds of demands for perfection, which is inevitable not to appreciate the difficulties of the public, and is too self-righteous. Education is inherently a poor career, but there is spiritual comfort. It is hoped that those engaged in education work will work together. Then Mayor Ma gave instructions, saying that the city government's total tax revenue is 400 million, while education expenditure is close to 500 million, which is more than the revenue. Finally, Director Ma of the Education Bureau reported that recently, Beijing City has increased schools and added classes, and several primary school buildings are under construction. The meeting adjourned at 11:30 a.m.

### My Student Studying in the UK, Li Zhuangfu, Succeeds in Biochemical Research; Solves a Problem Unresolved for Centuries

[British News Agency, London, April 4] Li Zhuangfu (transliteration), a Chinese student sent to the UK by the Sino-British Cultural and Educational Fund Board of Directors, is currently engaged in biochemical research under the guidance of Professor He Huasi at the University of Birmingham in the UK. It is reported that he has solved a problem that has remained unsolved for centuries. According to reports, the student graduated from Hunan Xiangya Medical College, and it is said that he has been able to crystallize cell nucleic acids. Therefore, this complex substance can be easily analyzed and the reactions of its various components can be discovered. This will be extremely important for the study of biochemistry, because after cell nucleic acids combine with proteins, they form cell nucleoproteins, which have a direct impact on the reproduction and growth of animals and plants. In short, cell nucleoproteins are the chemical expression of chromosomes or genetic factors within cells in Mendel's law of heredity. In the biological sciences, Mendel's law is currently the only accurate law, explaining how the characteristics of parents are inherited to their offspring, but so far, it has not been possible to express it in physical formulas. Eighty years ago, someone tried to answer this question, but it has not been resolved to this day. This is because it has not been possible to isolate it into a pure crystalline form. Before May, Mr. Li successfully transformed cell nucleic acids into crystalline bodies. His second step will be to isolate these molecules and then study what each unit is, and then he can find out the relationship between each component molecule and the various chromosomes. The value of this discovery may be inestimable. In the future, it may be possible to discover ways to maintain and strengthen required characteristics, as well as to eliminate the weaknesses of certain chromosomes. This area of research is full of hope.

### Jiaotong Bank Launches Tuition Savings; Relieves Parents' Financial Difficulties

The Jiaotong Bank in this city believes that education is the foundation of a country. However, school fees are currently expensive, and it is often difficult for general parents to raise such large sums of money at once, resulting in some children being unable to attend school. This is a matter of regret. In order to encourage children to attend school and reduce the financial difficulties of parents in raising tuition fees at one time, the bank has launched two secret savings deposits: "Individual Education Fund" and "Group Education Fund". The nature of these two types of savings deposits is the same. The former is designed for individuals to save for their children, and the latter is designed to facilitate group employees to save for their children. Both are limited to children currently studying in middle schools and universities. However, if a child has several people in middle schools and universities, they can also recognize several copies.

Two Types of Savings

Its method: Both individual and group savings deposits are deposited on a monthly basis. The amount of deposit is divided into eight types: 30,000 yuan, 40,000 yuan, 50,000 yuan, 60,000 yuan, 70,000 yuan, 80,000 yuan, 90,000 yuan, and 100,000 yuan per month. For individual savings, depositors can directly apply to the bank by filling out an account opening application form. For group savings, employees working in agencies, factories, and merchants can consult their service agencies for approval. The group is used as a unit, and the group is responsible for deducting the recognized deposit employee's salary on a monthly basis and sending it to the bank to open an account for deposit.

Five Times Loan

For both types of savings deposits, after two months of deposit, they can submit a loan application form along with their children's study certificate and apply to the bank for a tuition loan. The amount of the loan is five times the monthly deposit amount. For example, if 30,000 yuan is deposited each month, it can be borrowed 150,000 yuan based on five times the amount. If 100,000 yuan is deposited each month, it can be borrowed 500,000 yuan.

3% Interest Due

Whether it is individual or group, the deposit interest is 1.5%, and the loan interest is 3%, which is very different from the market loan interest. The deposit period is six months, and the loan period is four months. Both the deposit and the loan expire at the same time after two months of deposit. At maturity, the bank will settle the deposit and loan principal and interest separately, and the remaining funds will be returned to the depositor or the recognized deposit group. Because these two types of savings deposits can only be borrowed after two months of deposit, depositors should plan to deposit two months before the start of the school where their children are located so that they can be applied at that time. If they plan to raise school fees for next spring, they must start depositing in November. It is reported that the bank's branches are located throughout the country. No matter where children study, it is very convenient for parents to deposit and spend money. It is expected that there will be many depositors.

### New Lineup Unleashes Power: Hua Lian Smashes Fat Team Yesterday with a Score of 80 to 27

After the break, Hua Lian replaced Wu Chengzhang, Chen Xuechong, and Ren Xiangcheng with Kong Guangyi, Zhang Liangxiong, and Bao Songyuan. The Fat Team still did not improve, but still managed to score occasionally. When Hua Lian reached 55 to 18, Hua Lian changed its lineup again, with Cai Wenhua and Zhang Yuyi replaced by Wu Chengzhang and Ren Xiangcheng, forming the old Hua Lian lineup. Hua Lian's momentum surged again. As a result, Hua Lian won a big victory over the Fat Team with a score of 80 to 27. The results of each match last night are recorded below:

### Zhejiang Concerned About the Chairman's Whereabouts

— Hangzhou Dispatch, October 31, Special Correspondent Chu Yu of this newspaper

October 31 is the birthday of Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the National Government. This giant of great achievements, because of his busy schedule, has not returned to his hometown of Fenghua in these eight years of the war of resistance and the year after the war, except for one trip to Hangzhou. This great man who has not returned to his hometown for ten years—for the sake of the world and the country, shouldered an unparalleled task, endured hardships, and ignored all kinds of hard work and complaints. How eagerly they hoped to see him, even hug him, kiss him, because: he increased the glory of his hometown and added splendor to the nation. Many domestic newspapers believed that Chairman Chiang would definitely go to his hometown on this birthday. Therefore, at the beginning of the month, everyone paid attention to this news. Chairman Chiang from Lushan, E Jiang, and Nanchang in Jiangxi, news reporters attached great importance to his actions with all their energy. October 9 was his lunar birthday. Before the 9th, many newspapers reported that Chairman Chiang was going to return to Fenghua. Some even sent reporters to Fenghua to wait for him, and some even said with certainty: "Chairman Chiang will go to Xikou in Fenghua after inspecting Nanchang." But in his own mind, the affairs of the country and the nation were more important than personal matters. He had decided not to return to Xikou, but flew to Nanjing to deal with state affairs. On that day, his life was simpler than that of ordinary people. He still worked in the official residence and did not take special actions. He personally attended and presided over the 202nd regular meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council. This lunar birthday passed quietly. There is also a solar birthday. The people of the country, in order to express their enthusiasm for loving Chairman Chiang, although the Chairman repeatedly warned against extravagance, due to a kind of heartfelt support, they still made some preparations, and they more or less realized the Chairman's spirit of being selfless and forgetting himself, so they widely aroused the movement of offering schools to celebrate his birthday. Especially in Zhejiang Province, in addition to offering schools, there are many joyous activities. At this time, the call for Chairman Chiang to return to Fenghua to avoid his birthday came out again. The national press once again paid attention to the news of Fenghua. Beforehand, there were many rumors: one said that the Chairman would fly directly from Taiwan to Fenghua, one said that the Chairman would fly to Hangzhou after returning to Beijing and then fly to Ningbo and then to Fenghua, and one said that the Chairman would fly to Shanghai and then fly to Ningbo and then directly to Xikou.

Confusing Speculations

The newspapers in Zhejiang almost always used the Chairman's whereabouts as an important headline, allowing for news about coming to Zhejiang and me. We can list them: the Central News Agency is preparing to bring a radio station to Xikou, the Southeast Daily also has this preparation, the Zhejiang Daily has designated appropriate candidates, the Zhejiang Business Daily has obtained contact with the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, the Ningbo Communication of the Zheng Bao publishes daily, and the Datong Daily, the Youth Daily, the Min Bao, and the West Lake Evening News are all paying special attention. The Shanghai newspapers are also closely assigning reporters to compete for this news. The Xinwen Bao established an office in Hangzhou at the beginning of the month, the Dagong Bao strengthened contact with Ningbo, the Wenhui Bao sent a special correspondent to Hangzhou at the beginning of the month, and the Nanjing Central Daily also had a special correspondent in charge, taking advantage of the convenience of the special reporter accompanying Ambassador Stuart to Hangzhou, and also made considerable arrangements. After the Chairman flew to Taiwan on October 21, everyone felt nervous. Some in the press advocated sending people to Ningbo first, and some advocated waiting for Chairman Chiang to fly back to the first place before deciding on a plan. On the 28th, Zhejiang newspapers had two different predictions: one was that when Chairman Chiang returned to Shanghai from He on the 27th, he detoured through Songkou, flew low over it twice, expressing his affection, but because the political atmosphere in Nanjing was becoming more open, he had no time to return home, and would not return to Xikou in the short term. The other was that Chairman Chiang would soon fly back to Ningbo and then to Xikou to celebrate his birthday. On the 29th, those who predicted that Chairman Chiang would return to Xikou said that he would not go to Fenghua, while those who predicted that he would not go to Xikou said that he would fly to Fenghua to avoid his birthday. The Shanghai newspapers also had two different speculations. The news on the 30th was even more tense. Some said that he would still come to Zhejiang, and some said that he would go to a certain place to avoid his birthday. The reporter checked his own pre-placed news network, relying on information from all sides and Chairman Chiang's consistent spirit of selflessness and forgetting himself, and felt that the chances of him coming to Zhejiang were still very small. Therefore, the Shanghai newspapers still had two opposite views: one was the delayed return to his hometown published by this newspaper, and the other was the return to Fenghua to avoid his birthday published in the × newspaper. The rumors that night were even more confusing. Some said that he would fly to Fenghua with the Marshalls on the morning of the 31st, and Chiang Ching-kuo had already flown to Fenghua to make arrangements. Some said that Chiang Ching-kuo's wife went to Nanjing, and Chairman Chiang would avoid his birthday in the suburbs of Nanjing. Some said that Chairman Chiang might take a warship to Ningbo and then to Fenghua. Some said that Chairman Chiang would avoid his birthday at sea. Some said that Chairman Chiang would go to Wuxi with Marshal Marshall to avoid his birthday. The news in the newspapers on the 31st still could not publish his exact whereabouts, and some even published two opposite news items, leaving the readers to guess. These things, of course, represent the fierce competition in the current news industry, but the value of competing for news lies in the important needs and interests of the public, which shows that Chairman Chiang's whereabouts are of concern to the people of the whole country and even the people of the world!

A Wave of Revelry

On October 31, the people of the whole country rejoiced. I, in Zhejiang, the Chairman's hometown, felt especially intimate. This usually quiet Hangzhou also experienced a wave of revelry. On this day, everyone woke up especially early, the national flag was hung out early, and every household was decorated with lanterns and colored streamers. The birthday halls set up everywhere had a sense of traffic flow in front of them. The gold-sprinkled red stationery for signing birthday wishes was changed one after another. The taverns automatically reduced prices, the noodle shops had particularly good business, and shops posted notices: all goods are 10% off to celebrate the 60th birthday of the Chairman. Even the dance ban, which had been repeatedly requested to be lifted but was never heeded, was also lifted for these three days. Several places in Zhejiang held sports meetings to celebrate the birthday. These many activities were all trying to make them more meaningful and remain in people's minds for a longer time. Some people said: if Chairman Chiang did not repeatedly warn against extravagance, then this ancient China would really make a fortune on this day. Others said: if Chairman Chiang spent his birthday in his hometown, the people of Zhejiang would not know how excited they would be!

If Chairman Chiang is to return to Zhejiang to spend his birthday, we only need to truly realize a new China of peace, unity, and independence. If we believe that there will be such a day, then that day will come!

### Taiwan Fertilizer Distribution

According to Tang Yuanji, General Manager of Taiwan Fertilizer Company, all five factories of the company are operating at their highest production capacity, with an annual output of more than 50,000 tons, which is only one-tenth of the 60% of the total needs of the province. In addition to the supply from the Fertilizer Company this year, part of it relies on the distribution from the Taiwan Branch of the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA). When the branch distributed the first 3,000 tons of fertilizer shipped from the United States to Taiwan, the people welcomed the branch director Qian in Kaohsiung, which fully illustrates that chemical fertilizer is a necessity for agricultural production in Taiwan. The widespread and skilled use of it has helped to increase agricultural production, which is incomparable with the misunderstanding of the effect of chemical fertilizer by farmers in the interior.

### The Crisis of Hunan Mining

— October 6th, Changsha Air Dispatch, Special Correspondent Gao Yuanli

Hunan's mining industry is suffering from unprecedented economic downturn, and is constantly in the process of decline. The reasons for the downturn are, firstly, the impact of long-term war; and secondly, the result of the government's eight-year control. As a result, famous mines are mostly in a state of suspension. Although the war has ended and the control policy has recently been abolished by the government, in today's vicious inflation, recovery is still a distant prospect.

Government-Operated Mines

Hunan's metal and non-metal mines are very famous in both domestic and international markets. Such as tungsten, tin, mercury, and realgar, which are very important in the customs trade register, and among them, the production of mercury is not only extremely large, but also the only production area in the Far East. These mineral products are mainly government-operated, with the Construction Department presiding over the majority, but among them, there are also a small number of privately-operated antimony mines and non-metal mines such as coal mines, but the quantity is extremely small, and the capital is not strong enough.

Among the government-operated mines, there are four coal mines, namely, Liling Coal Mine, Qiyang Guanyintan Coal Mine, Xiangtan Yunhuqiao Coal Mine, and Ningxiang Qingxi Coal Mine, which have a history of many years. The reserves of Guanyintan Coalfield and Liling Shimenkou Coalfield are extremely rich. During the war, almost all of them were supplied to the Yuehan and Xianggui railways. Due to limited sales, there was no major development. During the period when Hunan fell, all four mines were suspended, and some of the equipment was severely damaged. After the rehabilitation, the Changjiang River transport was restored. Although the needs of the Yuehan and Xianggui railways will not increase immediately due to the road reconstruction project, the coal shortage in Wuhan made Hunan's coal industry immediately show prosperity. Therefore, the Construction Department began emergency resumption of work, the first step was to repair the important mine shafts, and the second step was to restore all the equipment, but the main work was still pumping water, so that it could immediately resume production. The emergency resumption of work progressed extremely smoothly, and the high price of coal in Wuhan was also one of the reasons for promoting its smooth completion. In just three months, the amount of coal produced by the four mines reached 10,000 tons per month. The situation of private mines is also the same. The urgent market demand naturally caused prosperity, and the abolition of the Coal and Coke Management Office allowed people to operate freely without being restricted, which is very helpful for the future of Hunan's coal industry. However, whether Hunan's coal industry can be prosperous forever is worth studying. The difficulties currently felt by both private and provincial coal mines include two items: 1. Insufficient equipment; 2. Inconvenient transportation. There is currently no clue for the replenishment of equipment. Although the Construction Department has requested the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to supply the required machinery, it is clear that it cannot be discussed at present. The transportation problem is equally serious. Production has increased, but can it be allowed to pile up in the mine? The distance between each mine and the Xiangjiang River is quite far, and the light railway has not been laid. Now it only relies on manpower and a very small number of shallow-water ships, and the transport capacity of the Xiangjiang River will not be immediately improved in today's lack of ships. Therefore, the provincial and private mines are quite anxious about these two problems, and only hope that the government can find ways to improve them, otherwise the current prosperity is just a flash in the pan.

Restoring Realgar Mine

In addition to coal mines, the Construction Department is actively working to restore the realgar mine between Cili and Shimen. Realgar is the realgar wine drunk during the Dragon Boat Festival. Its uses include general folk use as an insecticide, mainly sold to Northeast China and Southeast Asia. The provinces of Northeast China use it as an insecticide and fertilizer powder, while Southeast Asia must spread realgar on the bottom layer when building houses to prevent poisonous insects, and ships at sea must apply realgar to the hull to prevent barnacles from parasitizing and hindering navigation. The uses are extremely extensive. The Cishi realgar mine has been closed for many years. After the rehabilitation, the Construction Department cooperated with private individuals to mine it. The government and businessmen each invested 50 million yuan, and construction started at the end of last year. It is expected to produce 10,000 dan of realgar this year. This mining is scheduled for three years, and the total production will reach 30,000 dan, with considerable income, which is the most profitable type of provincial mining industry.

Lead, Zinc and Silver Mineral Production

In addition to the above two non-metal mineral products, the largest provincial metal mine is the Changning Shuikoushan Lead-Zinc Mine. Lead and zinc are symbiotic minerals, and the two often occur in the same place, and lead ore often contains silver, so it is often called lead-zinc-silver ore. The Changning Shuikoushan mining area is quite famous in China. The Construction Department should have set up a mining bureau there, with a large scale and complete equipment. It has been mining for more than 40 years, and the total amount of mineral sand produced is more than 1.5 million tons. The mining method is extremely modern. There is a light railway for transporting mineral sand, and there is also a modern smelting plant engaged in refining. The ore quality of this mine is extremely high. According to the analysis results, lead ore sand contains 66% lead and 9% zinc. Each ton of ore sand contains 8 to 10 taels of silver. As for zinc ore sand, it contains 46-7% zinc and 5% to 9% lead. At its peak, the number of miners reached 5,000 to 6,000, producing 150 tons of ore sand per day, refining 20 tons of lead, 40 tons of zinc, and 500 taels of silver. In recent years, due to the severance of sea transportation, it was impossible to export, and the output was greatly reduced. When Hunan fell, the mine was occupied by the enemy. The enemy attached great importance to it and originally intended to reopen it. Our side sent planes to destroy all the equipment of the mine, so it was unable to resume work after the victory. Now only a storage office is set up to be responsible for the safekeeping of the remaining equipment, but according to the person in charge of the Construction Department, the ore bed has been impoverished after many years of mining, and it is worth considering whether there is still mining value. It will only be possible to decide whether to resume work after re-drilling, but this is indeed the biggest loss in Hunan.

Tin, Antimony and Mercury Mines

Tin, tungsten, antimony and mercury mines are mineral products controlled by the government during the war, and almost all of them are export goods. However, as a result of the control, almost all mines were shut down. Tin is produced in Jianghua, Linwu and other places, and is necessary for military industry. Hunan's tin mines rank third in the country, and the ore is divided into placer tin and rock tin. The territory of Jianghua, Daoxian, and Ningyuan counties in Hunan is the main production area of ​​placer tin in the country. Although the reserves are not large, at its peak, it produced more than 10,000 market dans of pure tin every year. In recent years, it has been subject to government control, and it takes two or three months to review and price, so that the official price is far from the cost, and because of inconvenient transportation, the mines have closed down one after another, and the number of unemployed workers has reached 10,000 to 20,000. Recently, the government has abolished the control, but it is not possible to restore the old view in the short term.

The Authority of the Antimony Market

As for antimony mines, they are not only a specialty of Hunan, but also have the authority to influence the world's antimony market. China's antimony production accounts for about 80% of the total production, and Hunan's production accounts for more than 90% of the country's production, so it is a very promising mineral product. Hunan's antimony mines are distributed in 18 counties including Xinhua, Yiyang, Anhua, Shaoyang, Xiangxiang, Wugang, Xinning, Dong'an, Yuanling, and Chenxi, with the Xikuangshan in Xinhua being the most famous. The antimony ore in Xikuangshan is stibnite, with an antimony content of more than 50%. During the First World War, there were more than 100 companies and smelters mining antimony ore in the area, with more than 10,000 miners. The monthly output of pure antimony was as high as more than 20,000 tons. In recent years, the antimony industry in the area has declined, but the monthly output of pure antimony is still 1,000 to 2,000 tons, most of which are shipped to Shanghai and Hong Kong for sale overseas. During the war, the government purchased the controlled exports. The mine owners felt unprofitable. Last month, representatives of various mines gathered in Changsha to request the government to take measures to increase the purchase price. Recently, the Resources Committee approved the price of pure antimony to be increased by an additional subsidy of 180,000 yuan per ton on the original price of 320,000 yuan, for a total of 500,000 yuan. However, it is still very far from the black market price in Shanghai. The mine owners believe that the wartime control policy has become a thing of the past, and the government should abolish the control, so that they can freely develop and should no longer compete with the people for profit. Therefore, they plan to petition the government recently to achieve the goal of abolishing the control.

The above-mentioned mines are the largest and most promising mines in Hunan. Since the situation is so bad, other mines such as gold mines, manganese mines, and tungsten mines are also the same. The reason is due to the impact of the war, but the government's control is not reasonable. At this time, it is difficult to develop due to the restrictions of the facts, but how to cultivate vitality so that it will not fall into complete stagnation and closure should be worked hard at this time. Private capital is limited, and industrial and mining loans are right in name but not in reality, which is also the most distressing problem for Hunan mine owners.

### Eloquent Councilors and Impassioned Oratory: A Glimpse of the Kyoto-Nanking Assembly

— October 29th, Nanking Dispatch from Our Correspondent Ding Kuanghua

The popularly elected councilors of Kyoto City are in place, and immediately following the election, the final session of the provisional city council convened on the 25th at the Nanjing Municipal Government Auditorium. A gathering of distinguished figures assembled in one hall. Mayor Ma, upon opening the session, with a tone of benevolence, bestowed a considerable stimulus to those (both men and women) who had not been elected. He stated, "The city government had hoped that all members would be elected in this election, but the result was only sixty percent, which is deeply regretted. However, we hope that everyone can join in the work of construction from now on." Upon hearing this, the forty percent of unsuccessful candidates considered it a public insult, significantly affecting their pride. Thus, "seizing the opportunity," criticism of municipal governance immediately became the central issue.

After Heated Debate on Lifting the Dance Ban, the Original Resolution Is Upheld

The Nanking dance ban can be said to have been initiated by a major editorial in the Central Daily News, during a time when austerity measures were being implemented. Mayor Ma, fearing criticism, had to resolutely impose the ban. Dance hall proprietors, their livelihoods shattered, were unwilling to concede, and made several requests to lift the ban during the provisional council sessions. The council found itself in a dilemma, needing to represent public opinion while also considering the government's measures. Naturally, a firm decision was difficult to make. It was generally agreed that dancing is a form of entertainment, and permitting it under the principle of "managing without prohibiting, enjoying without excess" would not be entirely unacceptable. However, despite repeated lobbying by the dance hall proprietors, the authorities remained unyielding, refusing their requests. This time, with the convening of the provisional council, the dance hall proprietors believed they couldn't miss the opportunity and made another request. When the provisional council put it to a general assembly for discussion, it sparked a heated debate. Councilor Li Jianhong stated, "Considering the livelihood of the dancers, before banning dancing, we should provide them with a legitimate means of making a living. Dancing itself is not a sin, and proper entertainment should be promoted." Councilor Zhuang Maoru, on the other hand, argued that the negative aspects of dancing were numerous and advocated for a strict prohibition. Councilor Huang Luming stated, "In Europe and America, dancing is a form of etiquette and is inherently good, but it changes when it comes to China. Therefore, the principle should be not to prohibit dancing, but to manage it strictly." Councilor Zhang Wenbo solemnly stated, "This council's decision to ban dancing was an act in response to a national policy, as today's [situation] is filled with [hardship], and we must not be excessively licentious." Other councilors, such as Wang Yizhai, from a commercial standpoint, sympathized with the requests of the dance hall proprietors and advocated for managing without prohibiting. Councilor Sun Yulin stated that if the dance ban was a legal matter, the municipal government should be requested to report the basis of the law. The arguments were varied and inconclusive. Director Chen Jianru, in his capacity as the responsible official, delivered his "rearguard" speech. He stated, "The municipal government's dance ban was in accordance with the provisional council's resolution. At that time, there were too many dancers in Nanking, and social interaction was too excessive, which indeed affected public morals, and public opinion was highly critical. As for the dance hall proprietors' argument that the municipal government issued business licenses beforehand and should not ban them afterward, according to the law, once a new law is established, the old law naturally becomes invalid. Therefore, the municipal government's enforcement of the dance ban is naturally legal." At this point in the discussion, the chairman proposed a vote, and the result was to uphold the original resolution, "Strictly prohibiting dance halls." The councilors who advocated for dancing could only lament in vain, and at this point, like the dancers, they were coldly helpless.

Unequal Zoning of Power Outages: Plant Director Lu Admits Mistake

The Capital Electric Power Plant's generating boilers are quite dilapidated and in need of repair. To meet demand, repairs were initiated in October, and during the repair period, only zoned power outages could be implemented. Since its implementation, it has failed to satisfy the citizens. Lu Fazeng, the director of the Capital Electric Power Plant, came to the provisional council to report on operations. The councilors were not about to let him off easy. Councilor Sun Yulin's oral inquiry was probing, he said, "Why are the zoned power outages not fair? There are reasons why Huangpu Road and [Jiang]jiawan are not affected by power outages, as the former is the location of the Ministry of National Defense, related to national defense, and it is inconvenient to have power outages. The latter is the location of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, related to foreign affairs, and it is inconvenient to have power outages. However, the Shanxi Road area is neither related to national defense nor related to foreign affairs, so why is it not included in the power outage zone? Is it because it is the residence of important figures, and it is inconvenient to have power outages? Please, Director Lu, answer!" At this moment, Director Lu's face was flushed and he was extremely embarrassed. He stuttered and responded, "Regarding that point, I am not comfortable answering. Everyone knows who lives in the Shanxi Road area... "The councilors were extremely dissatisfied with this answer. Sun Yulin, Zhuang Maoru, Wang Guohong, and Yang Dewen pressed him for an answer. Director Lu could only say, "Everyone, please don't pressure me. It was all a mistake by one person named Lu. You can punish me in any way you want." His words were filled with despair. In the end, it was simply left unresolved.

### Be Cautious in Your First Love

— Naya

Living in the torrent of this new era, every woman will not necessarily be willing to be dominated by the old system again—will not want an unfree marriage, right? And what are the demands of the new women now? The answer is a straightforward sentence: free love, every girl must have the demand for love!

No one can deny that young ladies have the same demand for love as men, and at the time of maturity, they will inevitably demand a love object. At that time, they may not care about everything and find an object. They don't pay much attention to what kind of person the other party is. After getting to know each other, as long as the other party gives her a little joy, such as watching movies, going to parks, etc., and repeatedly treats her, making her feel that the other party seems to be considerate and seems to have fallen in love with her, because the girlhood has a naive, and can also be said to be innocent, mind; and does not understand the truth of this evil society.

"Lover" is here, although he does not have much talent, but because he often treats and is considerate, she can't bear to lose him again. This kind of first love is often wrong, and the result is entering the grave of love.

If it is really like this (it is seen a lot in society), then her life will be buried. After marriage, life is mostly unhappy, and many new opportunities that she should have are also abandoned from then on.

Then how should we have true love? How can she realize her future hopes? How can there be true happiness? Perhaps this series of questions will be asked by innocent young ladies? So, now I will give you a simple answer:

(1) When choosing an object, you must not be sloppy because of temporary needs. You should choose strictly. For example, what is the personality of this person? Are future expectations the same as mine? Do I have sincere friendship?

(2) Love is not a game. You can use treating and playing games to increase friendship. If you think this kind of attitude is right, then the future will definitely not be "happiness" but a "grave".

(3) During love, both parties should have a natural and sincere heart to observe each other whether we are suitable. Don't decorate the surface falsely. If you decorate falsely now, it will be the most distressing thing to "show the original form" after marriage. When emotions diverge, you lose happiness!

I won't nag too much. Young ladies, you should pay attention to what is true, good, and beautiful, and be cautious about your demands for first love!

### When a Child Is Sick

— Yang Yongzhang

(1) Children Really Do Get Sick

Eating a few more pieces of cream cake can actually cause indigestion in children; a popsicle, under certain circumstances, can also cause severe stomach pain and diarrhea in children; in the hot summer, after a long time of not getting sweet dew, suddenly a burst of heavy rain falls, and when others are cheering and thinking that the weather can be relatively cool, the child gets a cold because he forgot to put on an extra piece of clothing, so his nose runs, he coughs, he has a fever, and it makes him stay in bed for three or four days.

A glass placed properly on the table is grabbed by a five- or six-year-old child and used as a toy, but if the child is not careful and falls to the ground, the glass breaks and his head also breaks.

From a medical point of view, the morbidity and mortality rates of children are indeed higher than those of adults. Children under the age of fourteen are far inferior to adults in terms of physical development and physiological function. Due to weak resistance and lack of knowledge, children are always prone to illness. Acute infectious diseases such as measles, scarlet fever, diphtheria, and meningitis have taken away many precious young lives. Other common diseases such as nutritional disorders and gastrointestinal disorders greatly threaten the health of children. Most children are gluttonous, and some ignorant children often swallow the discarded watermelon peels and banana peels of others as delicacies. Many inexplicable things can be found in the mouths of children. "Illness enters through the mouth" This sentence seems to be specifically said to children. Also, colds, coughs, bronchitis, and pneumonia are almost unavoidable for every child. This is because the respiratory organs of children are particularly fragile. Other illnesses caused by accidental events, such as internal injuries and external injuries, cannot be considered few.

There is really too much, you can hear people saying everywhere: "Brother Zhang is having an attack", "Sister Li is having chills"... In short, children really do get sick.

(2) Only Be Anxious, Not Panicked

What to do when a child is sick? This is the problem that needs to be solved immediately after the child gets sick; especially the mother, she is particularly concerned about her baby - the child, and is deeply afraid that an accident will happen. Here is not to tell you what to do when a child has pneumonia, or what to do when a child has acute enteritis, what medicine to take, what injection to get, because this is basically impossible. I will only put forward a few central ideas, which are very popular.

When a child is unfortunately sick, first of all, don't panic. We should carefully observe his symptoms and act carefully. Do not panic yourself and lose your mind. Many children's illnesses may not be hopeless if they are properly treated and cared for. Calmness is really indispensable for every mother. Panicking is certainly unnecessary, but you cannot be indifferent. Some parents do not care about their children at all. Once the child is sick, they are neither panicked nor anxious, and unintentionally plant a huge disaster, which they will regret later. Many acute infectious diseases often end the child's life in a short period of time, so whether it is a cold, cough, or stomach pain, it should not be ignored. What to do when a child is sick? Remember, only be anxious, not panicked.

(3) Do Not Use Medications Randomly

It is certainly a good thing for a child to take some aspirin for a headache, but not all headaches can be cured with aspirin.

Now, Xiaozhilong and penicillin can no longer be regarded as the secret magic weapons of doctors. Because everyone knows these drugs. Some people (not doctors) often say: "A certain medicine is very good, give him a little." In fact, he does not understand anything about a certain medicine, and seems to understand but does not understand. Losing money is a small matter, and sometimes it can cause adverse results. Therefore, I think that when a child is sick, unless you have considerable confidence and experience, never use medications randomly, and make the child eat many unnecessary sufferings, especially do not watch advertisements and take medications, thinking that a child will be cured by drinking a bottle of cough medicine. Before taking medicine, it is best to consult with a doctor and ask for their opinion, so as not to lose money and ruin the opportunity for treatment.

(4) Seek Help From Reliable Doctors

Doctors are the protectors of patients. When a child is sick, the mother should find a reliable doctor to seek his help. Unfortunately, China's medical industry is really too depressed. There are many "doctors" who are no different from profit-seeking merchants. They have learned the method of making money and have forgotten their noble and sacred position and responsibility. But it must also be said that there are still many doctors who have a spirit of sacrifice and love.

I hope that after a child is sick, the mother should not ask doctors randomly. Many wealthy people often think that they have a lot of money, and they often lose faith in doctors, which is a big mistake. A doctor with rich knowledge and experience, coupled with moral cultivation, is the most ideal. We should listen to the doctor's instructions and act according to their words.

(5) Prevention is Better Than Cure

As the Western saying goes: "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure." After a child gets sick, parents should find out the cause of the disease and try to remove it to avoid the recurrence of the tragedy. Many children's diseases can be avoided, especially gastrointestinal diseases and respiratory diseases. As long as you pay attention to the child's usual health care, there will always be good results. The injection of preventive needles and the vaccination of cowpox are valuable for the prevention of diseases.

In the family, children should be fully instilled with common sense of hygiene, and they should be encouraged to develop athletic skills, so that their diet and daily life have certain rules, and they should have more contact with sunlight and fresh air, and have appropriate exercise and rest every day. With a healthy body, the resistance to diseases can at least be increased. What to do when a child is sick? Hey, it's best to prevent them from getting sick!

### The Sick Child Still Misses Toys

### Quarrel

— Li Ying

Quarreling is an extremely common occurrence. Friends, fathers and sons, siblings, and married couples all quarrel, especially married couples, where the possibility of quarreling is greatest. Why is this? Let me analyze it in detail:

A. Causes of Quarrels

The relationship between husband and wife is the closest and most intimate among all human relationships. Because they share morning and evening together, each other's shortcomings and mistakes can be discovered at any time. During the period before marriage or the early stages of marriage, both parties tend to accommodate and tolerate each other. Gradually, as time passes, what is known as "familiarity breeds contempt" arises, especially if one party is fond of talking too much, has an eccentric temperament, or peculiar hobbies, it is inevitable that quarrels will arise. Common examples include:

(1) Both parties in a marriage discover each other's shortcomings, their wills are incompatible, their temperaments clash, and they harbor differing opinions, leading to quarrels;

(2) One of the parties in the marriage develops affections for someone else and becomes dissatisfied with their current partner, using any pretext to achieve their goal of divorce;

(3) Under the influence of some form of stimulus or excessive drinking, the person's mind becomes muddled, leading to unreasonable quarrels;

(4) Some people believe that quarreling is an interesting thing and often use "quarreling" to spice up the mundane and monotonous life of the married couple.

B. Methods of Quarrels

There are many ways to quarrel. Quarreling differs between wealthy families and humble thatched huts, and it also differs between those with education and cultivation and those who are uneducated and uncouth. Broadly speaking, it can be divided into:

(1) In large families under feudal ethics, the husband is often tyrannical and unreasonable, and the wife can only cry silently, entrusting all her experiences to fate. This situation is becoming increasingly rare in today's society.

(2) This is the most common scenario: first, they scold chickens and dogs, then they argue and fight. As a result, the man runs away outside, and the woman returns to her parents' home. There are also cases of rude attitudes and physical violence, resulting in both parties being hurt.

(3) The worst way is to smash things, such as cherished vases, plaster statues, daily necessities like hot water bottles, glass cups, etc. At the moment of anger, people's anger surges to the sky, and they feel a little better after throwing things. In reality, it's not worth it at all. If you smash something today, you have to buy it tomorrow, resulting in financial loss and mental suffering. What's the point?

(4) In extreme cases, when quarrels reach a point where "greed obscures reason," someone might even "murder their husband," which is not unheard of, as history has proven.

C. Results of Quarrels

The result of a quarrel is often reconciliation, but sometimes it leads to divorce. However, divorce is not a simple transaction! Each quarrel between husband and wife creates more distance in their relationship. Those who like to smash things and tear clothes are wasting money, which only benefits the shop owners. It would be better to tear up banknotes instead. Furthermore, quarrels should not happen too often, as the worst thing is when the quarrel becomes "habitual" and uncontrollable. My friend and his wife were more loving than anyone else when they were newly married. Later, they had small quarrels every three days and big quarrels every five days. Today, they quarrel all the time, every moment. They quarrel while eating, and they quarrel while dressing. Both parties feel pain. This is what it means to quarrel habitually and not take it seriously.

D. Remedies for Quarrels

(1) Try to avoid quarreling as much as possible, especially the first time. When the other party is getting angry, calm yourself down and be patient. If the other party is right, quickly admit your mistake. If the other party is wrong and being unreasonable, then wait until the other party has vented their anger, and then use a gentle tone to explain things tactfully, making the other party realize their mistake on their own. The most important thing to avoid is public brawls, as everyone has their own self-esteem, and adding fuel to the fire will only make it burn brighter. You are husband and wife, what is there to be ashamed or embarrassed about? If both parties think back to the feelings they had during their initial love or early marriage, even a heart of stone would not ignite!

(2) If the temperaments of both parties are truly incompatible, then you should take a step back and think: you are already married, so just muddle through. The husband likes the smell of fish, but you feel nauseous as soon as you smell it. However, if you think: this is something that your loved one likes, then you will feel that the fishy smell has a special flavor.

(3) In fact, if the husband and wife really cannot get along any longer, then the man might as well go out and do his work alone, and the woman can also spend a period of time alone—it must be alone and single. After a few days, the man will miss his wife, and the woman will think about her husband. They will surely both admit that living together as husband and wife is more comfortable, happier, and more "meaningful" than being alone.

In short, quarreling between husband and wife is an unavoidable thing. However, one must find the possible within the impossible. The most important thing between husband and wife is mutual tolerance and understanding, and mutual love. Not only can quarreling be avoided, but these two principles are also necessary for maintaining genuine affection.

### The Opera of Dream of the Red Chamber

— Ye Dejun

After Gao E's continuation of the one hundred and twenty chapter edition of "Dream of the Red Chamber" was published in the late Qianlong period, many continuations were written during the Jiaqing and Daoguang periods. At present, there are fourteen known versions. At the same time, there were also many adaptations of "Dream of the Red Chamber" into operas. "Dream of the Red Chamber" can be said to have been extremely popular at that time. Regarding the zaju and chuanqi of "Dream of the Red Chamber", only three types are generally known, as described in Aoki Masaru's "History of Modern Chinese Opera." But in fact, there are more than that, at least the following types:

"Romance of the Dream of the Red Chamber," written by Zhong Yunjian, published in the fourth year of Jiaqing (Yiwei year). The book is divided into two volumes: the upper volume has thirty-two acts, and the lower volume has twenty-four acts. It was written based on the original and continuation books of "Dream of the Red Chamber" and was the most widely circulated. The four acts recorded in the "Collection of Music Scores" are selected from this book. Yang Maojian's "Chang'an Watching Flowers Record" and Liang Tingnan's "Vine Flower Song Talk" Volume 3 have recorded it, and Liang praised it highly. Yunjian's name is unknown, he was known as the Woodcutter of the Red Bean Village, a native of Suzhou, and was formerly a disciple of Ao (above seen in the original book's inscription and signature), his life is unknown.

"Awakening from Stone" (also known as "Dream of the Red Chamber"), written by Wan Rongen, published by Xiangxin Bookstore in the eighth year of Jiaqing (Guihai year) (collection of the Peking Library, not seen), Mr. Zheng Zhenduo has a manuscript copy (see Xidi's Bibliography of Rare Opera Books). The book is divided into two parts: "Xiaoxiang Lament" and "Yihong Joy," the former has four collections of thirty-six acts, and the latter has two collections of twenty-four acts. Yao Xie's "Examination of Present Music" (10), "Outline of Dream of the Red Chamber" records it. Wan Rongen, courtesy name Yuqing, styled Xinqing Jushi, was a native of Jiangning and was good at painting. In addition to this book, his other opera work is "The Exile Flower Tower," see Feng Jinbo's "Ink Fragrance Residence Painting Knowledge" Volume 10.

"Dream of the Red Chamber Scattered Suites," written by Jing Shishanmin, published by Chanbo Pavilion in the twentieth year of Jiaqing (Yi Hai year). The book has only sixteen acts: Returning Home, Burying Flowers, Warning Song, Proposing Titles, Listening to Autumn, Sword Meeting, Joint Sentences, Foolish Eulogy, Pin Lament, Sending Love, Walking Demon, Zen Agreement, Burning Manuscripts, Nether Ascension, Complaining of Sorrow, Awakening from Dreams. Each act is about one event and is not continuous, it is a variation of the zaju (this style was popular during the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods, such as Yang Chao's "Ging Feng Pavilion" thirty-two kinds, Xu Ang's "Writing Heart Zaju" eighteen kinds). "Chang'an Watching Flowers Record," "Vine Flower Song Talk," "Examination of Present Music" (10) are all recorded. Wu Mei's "Outline of Chinese Opera" said that Jing Shishan was Huang Zhaokui, a native of Taicang. "Examination of Present Music" is titled Wu Hao, saying: "Hao is a native of Zhenyang, a student of the Imperial Academy, and has written a 'Collection of Poems and Essays from Jing Shishanfang', 'Examples of Epitaphs and Stone Inscriptions from the Han, Wei, and Six Dynasties,' and styled himself Jing Shishanmin." Yao's saying is quite true.

"Dream of the Red Chamber," written by the Master of Flower Rhyme Hermitage, published by Jiamao in the twenty-fourth year of Jiaqing, collection of the Peking Library. One volume, ten acts, also in the zaju category. This book is only recorded in the catalog of the opera music exhibition. According to the Master of Flower Rhyme Hermitage is Shi Yunyu, Shi's courtesy name is Zhiru, styled Zhuotang, Old Man of Independent Learning, Master of Flower Rhyme Hermitage are all other titles, a native of Wuxian, and reached the rank of Shandong Investigating Censor. He wrote nine kinds of zaju "Nine Performances Among Flowers": Fu Sheng Teaching Classics, Luo Fu Picking Mulberry, Tao Ye Crossing the River, Peach Blossom Spring Fisherman, Consort Mei Writing Fu, Letian Opening the Pavilion, Jia Dao Sacrificing Poems, Qin Cao Participating in Zen, Dui Shan Rescuing a Friend (there are original Qianlong editions, Jiaqing reprint editions, and Qing Dynasty miscellaneous operas). Shi's "Complete Collection of Independent Learning and Consideration" fully collects the nine kinds, except for "Dream of the Red Chamber."

"Twelve Hairpins," written by Zhu Fengsen, published in the "Six Songs of Yunshan" edition of Jiaqing. This book is collected in the Peking Library and has not been seen. The opera listings of various families do not record it, only Xu Hongpan's "Three Hairpins Dream" mentions it in the first place. Fengsen's courtesy name is Yunshan, a native of Lingui, his life is unknown. He wrote a total of six operas.

"Three Hairpins Dream," written by Xu Hongpan, in the "Northern Songs of Six View Tower" edition (there are Daoguang and Tongzhi editions). This kind is also a zaju style, and the list of operas has been lost. Xu's other operas include: "Records of the Western Liao," "Goose Hanging Book," "Female Yuntai," "Filial Daughter Saves an Orphan," "Confucian Official Completes the City" five kinds.

"Romance of the Dream of the Red Chamber," written by Chen Zhonglin, there are original Daoguang Han Qingzhai editions and Guangxu sixteenth year reprint editions (there are also popular printed editions). The book has eight volumes and eighty acts, quite long. "Examination of Present Music," "Song Records" are both recorded, "Chang'an Watching Flowers Record," "Miscellaneous Tales of Song Lyrics" are all dissatisfied with his work. According to Chen's courtesy name is Houfu, a native of Yuanhe, a Jinshi in the Jiaqing period, and served as the Hangjiahu Road official, specializing in model essays.

"New Songs of the Red Chamber," written by Yan Baoyong, written around the third and fourth years of Daoguang. This book has not been seen in the present passing down editions, "Examination of Present Music" (Four) Qing Zaju department records it. According to Yan Baoyong's courtesy name is Danchang, styled Wenqiao, a native of Dantu, and served as the Qixia magistrate of Shandong. His written zaju include: "Waiting for Husband Stone" (four acts), "Guinu Feng" (six acts), there are popular printed editions handed down. "Examination of Present Music" additionally records six kinds (including this one): "Meng Lan Dream" (extant), "Same Heart Words," "Strange Flower Mirror" (the above two kinds and new songs are also seen in Jiang Baoling's "Ink Forest Present Words" Volume Eleven), "Swallowing Felt to Repay," "Double Smoke Record," the last four kinds have not been seen in the present passing down editions. Although this kind has not been seen in the present passing down editions, Liang Zhangju's "Continued Talks on Olive Couplets" Volume 4 briefly recorded this play: "Yan Wenqiao said: Between Guiwei and Jiajin in the Daoguang period, I stayed in the capital for the imperial examination, and I often made new songs in my spare time and entrusted them to the pear garden to sing, which moved the people of that time, and many people took me as a teacher. I once had a sentence that said: 'I occasionally make a stage play, and I actually burden people to be concerned about it nationwide,' which is true. ... He also said: The 'Red Chamber' zaju I made, among which there is an act about scarves, describing the marriage of Hua Xiren to Jiang Yuhan. When it was about to be staged, the song master came to ask: 'Setting up a new room on the stage,' still lacking a couplet on a plaque, begging for a writing of it." I immediately wrote the four characters "Jade Soft Flower Delicate" as the plaque. I repeatedly thought about the antithetical couplet but could not understand it, and while I was hesitating, I suddenly saw two young actors arriving, who were his disciples: one named Tianshou, styled Meisheng; one named Xianshou, styled Yuesheng, who were studying this play together, and with their affections in mind, they formed a couplet: "Good sons and daughters, Heaven and Immortals with double longevity," "Small reunion, eyebrows and moon for three lives."

The operas of "Dream of the Red Chamber" that are currently known are the above-listed eight kinds. Wang Guowei's "Song Records" also recorded one written by Gao Lanshu based on "Miscellaneous Tales of Song Lyrics." According to Volume 3 of "Miscellaneous Tales," Zhang Wentao's poem states; he mistakenly took Gao E's continuation of "Dream of the Red Chamber" as an opera, and "Song Records" therefore mistakenly included it.

Lunan Mile, with its strange mountains and waters, in the months of late winter, the weather is clear and bright, the ice and snow are just melting, the reeds and rushes have grown long, the cool breeze is gentle, and the white dew has not yet frosted. Calling friends and bringing companions, we travel to this famous state; the local customs are elegant, and the rhymes are melodious; looking at the past from the present, the ancient tunes are vast and distant, vulgar sounds compete, and elegant music is completely lost. After the loss of rites, we seek compensation from the wild. The residents are Sani people, building earthen houses, their clothing is simple and unadorned, and their customs are like those of the Tang Dynasty. They rest at sunset and are busy at sunrise, living a muddled life, wandering leisurely; like the land of Peach Blossom Spring, and the paradise of Huaxu. Traveling to this scenic spot, from the end of winter to the beginning of spring, early flowers show their beauty, and new water exudes fragrance; the host and guests are indistinguishable, and chickens and dogs forget each other; hunters set their nets, and silkworm girls hold their baskets. The spring breeze blows green, and the autumn frost withers yellow. In the depths of winter, they sun their backs, and in the heat of summer, they carry their bags. In the east, north, and wild, they drunkenly drink a thousand cups; men and women sit together in a state of free and righteous emperors; Yang Baihua tunes, and He Manzi melodies, they come to seek happiness, and take this as their home.

Suddenly the color of the journey is urgent and the sky will be dark. Finding a mountain and water country by the Long Lake; not knowing if our people are happy villagers, the furnace smoke and salt are vast north of Songping. The mountains encircle the flatlands, and the pine wind falls to an end, the wind sends the palace and merchants' tunes that are not yet finished, the traces of sound and moon gorge, and the reeds and flowers are white, the brilliance is still vaguely unattainable; a path leads through the green mountains by the water, the autumn scenery in front of the village is red with evening maples, this place has never had a Jiazi year, flowers bloom and fall, passing through chaos. Farming mountains and fishing in the water, fishing nets and hunting bows; in Utopia, in the ideal country; working hard, morning and evening; beautiful myriad trees of flowers, towering thousands of piles of stones, the moon is bright on the top of Wangmao Mountain, the sons and daughters in the village are heartbroken; there is no intention of summoning the soul, but there is a natural thought of weeping leaves and grieving flowers. The earth fire burns fiercely, hurting the listening guests, the sound rises and draws silk, suddenly tearing silk, the northern ballad is suitable for激唱，南骚楚舞 emphasizes low拍; Yi's sleeves are full of tears, how should the wild people's clothing mourn? Do not ask Liu Ruan of Tiantai, the peach blossom faces are ambiguous.

### Record of Zhao Jingshen

— Shao Fu

Some years ago, I read Mr. Jingshen's "Silhouettes of Literary Figures." I had long admired his frequent contact with literary figures and the depth of his friendships. After the victory, I saw his "Impressions of Literary Figures," which added to my admiration for him. In these decades, on this literary scene, to be able to firmly hold one's position, never shaken by external forces, but instead strengthening his fighting spirit because of the sacred war of resistance, Jingshen can be considered one to be mentioned.

In fact, as long as one pays a little attention to the situation of the literary scene since the literary movement, everyone knows Mr. Jingshen's loyalty to this work of literature. During his time at Nankai Middle School in Tianjin, perhaps even earlier than this, Jingshen had already committed himself to literature. Since then, he has been cautious, working tirelessly, only moving forward, never falling behind. First, he explored folk tales, then he introduced news from the world literary scene. In recent years, he has been researching opera and novels, and even jokes, burying himself in hard work, diligently and tirelessly. His old excavations and new discoveries have had a considerable impact on the literary scene. In particular, his introduction of "Chekhov's Masterpieces" is an immortal undertaking in the field of Chinese translation literature. His perseverance and sustained dedication should put to shame those introducers of Western literature who are fickle and opportunistic!

Once, he gave a lecture at Daxia University. A narrow classroom was so crowded that even the windows were full of people. It was truly a sea of people, with thousands of heads jostling. Mr. Jingshen's humorous lecture, coupled with his dancing hands, earned him countless applause! This matter is more than ten years ago, but it still leaves a deep impression in our minds, and it will not be erased in the future!

Mr. Jingshen is most known for his tireless efforts in supporting younger generations. Almost all the active writers on today's literary scene have had a relationship with Mr. Jingshen. In particular, "Youth World," which he still edits, has unearthed countless young writers. He is frank, straightforward, and does what he says... all the characteristics of a good person can be found in him. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, with a heart of loyalty and filial piety to the nation and the country, he escaped from the enemy's close surveillance and went to Dabie Mountain in western Anhui to continue serving the country's cultural and educational work. This spirit of perseverance and hardship is no less than that of a soldier fighting the enemy on the front line!

Writer's Anecdotes

### Mark Twain on Quitting Smoking

— Shen Si

The American novelist and humorist Mark Twain, whose real name was Samuel Langhorne Clemens (1835-1910), once had a heated debate with a friend about quitting smoking. The friend said that quitting smoking was extremely difficult, but he said it was quite easy. So he used his experience to explain, saying: "What's so difficult about quitting smoking! I have experience, I'll tell you: I myself have quit more than a thousand times, is that considered difficult?"

### An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 83

— Ye Jingfeng

"Humph!" This is a nasal sound peculiar to the Japanese. Sure enough, it was immediately followed by a rustling and heavy voice scolding "Ba ga ×××". Although this sound was separated by the wall, it could be heard that the distance from where we were sitting was at most three or four yards. Before the scolding stopped, we also heard the barking of a dog, mixed with human voices. After a while, the barking gradually increased, barking and whimpering, mixed with heavy footsteps, stomping and stomping, and the sound of the dog's paws scratching the gravel on the ground. These complex sounds, put together, can clearly be imagined, as if someone was leading a large ferocious dog; the dog was struggling with the leash, wanting to run forward, and the person holding the leash was pulling it back with all his might, not letting the dog run.

The man and the dog, one struggling forward and the other dragging back, made a fuss for a while, and then suddenly heard the man shouting loudly, and at the same time heard as if he had kicked the dog. The dog, after being kicked, only howled once, but did not stop struggling, but struggled closer and closer to where we were sitting, and there was also the sound of fierce jumping. Judging from this situation, I determined that someone must be leading a mad dog and walking towards us. The dog's sense of smell is sharp, perhaps it smelled our scent, so it wanted to break free from the rope that was tethering it, jump over the wall, and attack us. However, because no one had ever crossed the border here, the Japanese were careless, so the person leading the dog did not think that there was someone outside the wall, only thinking that the dog had suddenly become wild and disobedient. Therefore, he only wanted to restrain the dog, and did not want to check the wall.

I guessed this situation, and felt a chill rise up my spine. Subconsciously, I reached out and grabbed Tiger Brother's arm, and at the same time turned my head to look at Tiger Brother. At this time, Tiger Brother also realized what was happening on the other side of the wall. He was also listening very carefully with his ears pricked up. In the dim light, I saw that there was no trace of fear on his round little face.

The person and the dog on the other side of the wall made a fuss for a while, and gradually calmed down. Finally, only a series of sounds like "pish pish" were heard, as if a whip or leather strap was being used to whip the dog. While whipping, he muttered, and the dog howled softly twice after being whipped. Only then did the movements and sounds of the person and the dog stop. It was quiet for a long time before a "chih" sound was heard, right behind us, as if a match had been struck. It was at this time that the searchlight swept over again, flashing past in front of us.

The searchlight swept over and past three times in a row; the movements were very uniform, and the interval between each sweep and flash seemed to be a certain amount of time. I suddenly realized that this searchlight was not the kind used by the military, but the kind used by maritime lighthouses, which automatically rotated. I estimated the time, and it seemed that every six or seven minutes or so, it rotated a circle. What was the purpose of installing this kind of light here? I think the biggest purpose is probably a kind of vigilance; perhaps on that bridge, there are occasional sentries on the lighthouse looking around with binoculars, using the light to look around, fearing a sneak attack: at the same time, it also lets people know that there is security in this restricted area. Realizing this point, I felt a lot more relieved and reduced a lot of tension.

After the light swept past for a while, I suddenly heard the dog panting again; immediately afterwards, the heavy footsteps, with a rhythm, sounded again, really walking behind us. At this time, if it suddenly stopped, needless to say, we must have been discovered outside the wall. But the footsteps did not stop, and listening carefully, I knew that it was walking past step by step.

### Handling of Trust

— Shao Fu

The Trust Bureau, entrusted by the Handling Bureau, is bidding to sell enemy and puppet real estate for the second time. If it follows the Trust Bureau's method, at least 10,000 or more citizens will be driven to the streets without a home. I don't want to say angry words (the realistic purpose of life is nothing more than seeking food, clothing, shelter, and transportation. If there is no place to accommodate oneself, it is actually right to be angry!). I am willing to calmly and rationally discuss the matter. Now, I will comment on the remarks made by the person in charge of the Trust Bureau and the Handling Bureau (in fact, the heads of the bureaus are the same person).

The Trust Bureau said: "The purpose of handling this business is to serve, and the problems that arise directly are not what this bureau wants to handle." It completely pushes the responsibility away cleanly, meaning that it is only responsible for selling, as for whether it can be sold, whether it can be sold, or whether there are other disputes after the sale, it cannot be managed.

As for the Handling Bureau, the Handling Bureau said: "For all the houses that have been bid on, the original residents should be maintained first, that is, based on the original owner's lease agreement as the standard, it is absolutely not the case that the owner who won the bid can order the residents to move out. If the original lease has long expired, of course, another notice should be made..."

This passage is very grand and plausible at first glance, but it is actually equivalent to saying nothing. Why? Taking the thirty-nine units that were bid on this time as an example, either the leases had long expired, or they were occupied by civil servants who came from the rear after the victory. They did not get the convenience of "allocation," so where would there be any lease agreements from the original owner? Since it is called enemy and puppet real estate, the original owner is either an enemy (who was sent back to their country) or a puppet (who is in prison), so how can they sign a contract with them? Isn't this clearly a joke?

Shanghai also has real estate transactions, and I have never heard of selling a house and having to drive away the tenants. Could it be that these tenants are also enemies and puppets?

The Trust Bureau wants to sell, and I think the more than 10,000 tenants in these thirty-nine units will definitely not object. The transfer of property rights is because you have no money and cannot afford to buy real estate! However, the original residents' right to lease will not be relaxed at all unless machine guns are used to shoot them. Therefore, I said yesterday: If the presiding authorities do not consider it again, it will lead to unexpected events.

In fact, it is very simple, as long as the Handling Bureau announces: This sale of houses is a transfer of property rights, and the original residents have the priority to rent, then there will be no disputes. However, can our hardworking, meritorious, and wise Handling Bureau handle it in such a clear and straightforward way?

News Materials

### Concerning "Sadism"

— Mai Ye

Have you noticed? A few days ago, this newspaper's international news page carried a shocking Reuters dispatch from London dated the 16th: "Former Air Force pilot Heath, originally a handsome youth, was hanged today at Pentonville Prison for sadism, having killed two women. This is a shocking case in British history. The offender first murdered film actress Mrs. Garner. The victim's naked body was found in his room at a London hotel on June 21st of this year. Her feet were bound, and her chest and back were whipped in seventeen places. There were teeth marks on her body, and she had been severely mutilated with an instrument resembling fire tongs. Less than two weeks after this case, he killed a beautiful young woman named Marshall in a similarly sadistic manner at Ben Endis Beach. Her corpse was found in a tomb near the coast, also with bite marks and whipping marks on her body."

"Sadism," called "Sadism" in English, is also translated as "abuse-related sexual perversion." From a psychological perspective, it undoubtedly belongs to a kind of abnormal psychology and pathological behavior. To put it simply: a sadist must inflict pain on their beloved (whether the love is mutual or one-sided) in order to feel satisfied and pleasure, and the more pain they inflict, the happier they become. The actions of the airman mentioned in the telegram above are typical examples.

However, in the process of love between the sexes, there are often very mild "sadistic" behaviors, which are often not considered unusual by ordinary people. For example, as described in old novels: the "talented scholar" would pluck a strand of hair from the "beautiful woman's" head as a souvenir, or the man would bite the woman's finger, even drawing blood, in order to feel pain. Or, they would bite each other's arms as an oath; or playfully slap their lover's face in mock anger... all of these are manifestations of "sadism," differing only in degree. The foot-binding of the Qing Dynasty, or the saying "King Chu loved slender waists" leading to many deaths by starvation in the palace, is also a manifestation of sadism.

Castration - Necrophilia

Castration, necrophilia... these kinds of terrible, cruel acts also belong to "sadism." Twelve or thirteen years ago, a sensational crime occurred in Tokyo, Japan, mobilizing national newspapers, broadcasting stations, and police networks, which were able to capture the female criminal through joint efforts. According to her subsequent confession: she loved that man very much, but she wanted to possess him, permanently and securely, so she had to strangle him to death. An even more terrible manifestation of cruelty was that she cut off the man's genitals. After committing the crime, she fled to many places. Many days later, when she was captured, the package containing what she had cut off was still treasured in her bosom. She was not like an ordinary madman; once the cruelty had passed, all her thinking and reactions returned to normal. At the time, some predicted that she would definitely be sentenced to death, but the court accepted the opinion of a psychological expert's examination report and sentenced her to a very, very light crime. However, after leaving prison, she had to live in a mental hospital for a period of time.

Numbness - Satisfaction

The male protagonist Heath mentioned in the telegram above, if he were not a soldier and not tried by military law, he probably would not have been sentenced to hanging.

Similarly belonging to abnormal psychology is so-called "masochism" or "abuse-related sexual gratification," which is a pair of twin brothers with the "sadism" mentioned above. The symptoms of "masochism" are that ordinary sexual stimulation and sexual enjoyment from external sources do not bring satisfaction or even cause numbness. Only by allowing a lover to whip, bite, tear, or even slaughter them as much as possible can they feel supreme interest and satisfaction. "Sadism" is active, while "masochism" is passive, but there is no great difference in essence. Novels say that women feel greater pleasure when a man bites her lip during a kiss, which is the mildest example of "masochism." "Tattoos" and "body art," as well as the nose and ear piercings of uncivilized peoples, also originate from "masochism."

Occasional Thoughts on Current Events

### Military Officers

— Zhao Lan

The incident of destroying a newspaper office has not completely faded from people's minds; in ××, a troublesome place, two shocking events, the "×× Murder Case" (see the front-line newspaper three days ago) and the "Railway Station Military-Police Conflict Case" (see this newspaper three days ago), have occurred in succession within the past week.

Coincidentally, both of these events were orchestrated by the ×× Brigade stationed in ××. Regarding these, I feel that the ×× Brigade is outrageous!

In the ×× Murder Case, a rickshaw driver ran over and killed a soldier. Logically, the security authorities should investigate the responsibility for the accident and then hand it over to the judicial authorities to be sentenced to the appropriate punishment. That is the proper way. How could they send representatives to the county government to demand compensation for medical expenses, family living expenses, children's education, etc., totaling 120 million yuan? The county government could not come up with this huge sum, so they were deemed to have not given a sincere response, and the rickshaw driver was executed by shooting?

Regarding this matter, let's not discuss whether "regardless of the responsibility for the accident, all drivers are sentenced to death" is the law of the country when a soldier is run over. Just in terms of the rickshaw driver running over the soldier, why should he be subject to military law and be executed by shooting? Does Wuxi not have a court? I am somewhat puzzled!

Regarding the railway station military-police conflict case, this is even more bizarre. Banning soldiers from riding without tickets is a government order! The railway police were carrying out the order and did nothing wrong. Yet this group of ×× Brigade's "××" actually started fighting, destroyed the railway station, seized the railway police's firearms, and injured railway police and senior officials, charging three times as if facing a formidable enemy, using the section headquarters as a target, and firing guns continuously for a day and night! (According to reports, it has not been resolved as of the 2nd)

"Banning riding without tickets" is a national law, and "railway section stations" are national property. Every citizen must strictly abide by national laws! Everyone must do their best to protect national property! However, the "military officers" of the ×× Brigade not only did not abide by national laws, but also destroyed national property! They beat public servants who were serving the country!

For the sake of protecting human rights, implementing national laws, and enforcing military discipline, we should loudly call for correcting this barbaric behavior! Because they are now military officers. If military officers are like this, what will the troops they lead in the future be like!

Let us wait and see the outcome of this incident, because it can be used as a test of military discipline in the future.

### House Numbers · Lane Names · Dust

— Cai Lin

Many large companies and stores only seek to build magnificent facades, and what architects find most annoying and hate to deal with is a blue-background, white-lettered house number sign, which they find impossible to place properly, so they simply do without it. Therefore, there are many companies and stores in Shanghai whose doors do not have house numbers, and there are even many consecutive doorways without house numbers. If a stranger wants to find the house number there, it is very difficult.

Originally, lanes had lane names with "×× Li," and there were also numbered porcelain signs nailed by the Public Works Bureau. However, many businesses and small factories have opened in the lanes, and the tin signs at the entrances of the lanes are as densely packed as plaques in a temple, completely obscuring the lane names and numbers. If you want to find a certain number in a certain lane, where can you find it?

It is said that the Public Works Bureau is currently working on reorganizing house numbers, and I hope they will pay attention to a few points and find ways to improve or punish those who don't comply.

Before "August 13th," Shanghai's roads had many street sweepers wearing red vests, responsible for cleaning. The terrazzo on the sidewalks was rinsed every day or two, swept clean, and water trucks even circled on the roads all day long. At that time, the roads were "the cleanest," indeed extremely sanitary.

More than a year has passed since the victory, and everything in Shanghai seems to have returned to normal. Now, the only things missing are the water trucks and the street sweepers in red vests. Even if there are any, they may only sweep a few important sections of the road, so "dust accumulates into a tower" everywhere (filthy beyond description). If you run on the road on a windy day, it is like being in the desert area of Mongolia, with gray sand flying, making it impossible to open your eyes. Especially now in late autumn, the fallen leaves on the sidewalks are an inch thick, full of poetic sentiment.

Using air, Shanghai has invented a wind sweeper.
