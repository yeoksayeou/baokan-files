### Zheng Jiemin Suddenly Flies to Nanjing for Instructions; Situation in North China Extremely Tense

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 14th] Military Mediation Department committee member Zheng Jiemin suddenly left Beiping and flew to Nanjing this afternoon. It is generally speculated that Zheng's trip symbolizes the extremely tense situation in North China. The Military Mediation Department is facing major difficulties, and Zheng urgently needs to report or seek instructions from the central government. The current situation in North China can be summarized in a few words: frequent military deployments, sporadic conflicts occurring everywhere, and continuous destruction of transportation. The deterioration of the situation is unprecedented since the armistice agreement. However, to say that the Communist army is attempting to encircle Tianjin and Beiping seems to be an overstatement. This afternoon, a certain government military leader told reporters that the Communist side in North China is carrying out large-scale deployments, reinforcing the Northeast, and destroying transportation to prevent the National Army from reinforcing the Northeast. On the other hand, they fear that the remaining forces in North China are weak, so they are adopting an offensive-defensive strategy, launching attacks everywhere. However, these continuous small-scale conflicts are the breeding ground for large-scale war. The situation in North China is also very noteworthy. The conflict in the northern section of the Jinpu Railway is currently the focus of attention here. National Army troops have already arrived in the Fengjiakou area, and fierce fighting is currently underway. Baotou is still occupied by the Communist army. In the vicinity of Pingbei (northern Beiping) in the areas of Huairou, Zunhua, and Miyun, the Communist army under Li Yunpin is gathering in large numbers, and the situation is also extremely tense.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 14th] The government side of the Military Mediation Department has lodged a serious protest against the Communist army's occupation of Fengjiakou and Baotou, demanding that the Communist army leaders who occupied these two places be punished and immediately withdraw, arguing that the Communist side should be held responsible for violating the ceasefire order. The Communist side claimed that this was due to the Communist army in that area being attacked by the National Army. Later, the American representative of the Baotou group proposed that neither side station troops in these two areas. The government side believes that if this is resolved in this way, there is no guarantee that similar incidents will not occur again in the future, so they insist on their original protest. This has not yet been resolved. Therefore, there is a proposal for the Military Mediation Department to send another group to investigate. As for rumors that Mi Luohan, the government representative of the Baotou group, was killed, the government side denies it.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 14th] The Beining Railway, a major supply route for the Northeast National Army, is currently being subjected to continuous and planned destruction by the Communist army. This morning, the Qian'suo and Gaoling stations on the section of the Beining Railway outside the Shanhaiguan Pass were suddenly surrounded by more than 10,000 Communist troops, and fierce fighting is underway. Bridge No. 156 in Xiao'ancun was destroyed at 1:30 PM this afternoon, and Bridge No. 157 was destroyed at 3:30 PM this afternoon. The railway tracks two kilometers east of Wangjiacun between Qian'suo and Gaoling were also destroyed. Xiaosonglinggou near Gaoling was occupied by more than 10,000 Communist troops last night at 9 PM. The telephone line between Tangshan and Shanhaiguan on the section within the Shanhaiguan Pass was destroyed at 11 PM last night and has not been restored as of this afternoon.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 14th] News about the Battle of Sipingjie is conflicting. The local *World Daily* and *Dajin Yishi Daily* today carried urgent telegrams stating that after seven days of fighting, the area has been completely captured by the National Army. However, a Xinhua News Agency telegram from the 10th stated that the fighting in the city had reached a stalemate after nine days of artillery bombardment by the National Army. It also stated that Zheng Dongguo is currently directing operations at Shuangmiaozi, south of Sipingjie.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th] Official intelligence states that the Communist army has recently made plans to reorganize the command of its troops in various regions. The division of responsibilities in the Shanxi area is as follows: (1) The area west of the Pinghan Railway between Shijiazhuang and Zhangde, east of the Baijin Railway, and south of the Zhengtai Railway is under the command of Liu Bocheng, with Li Da as his deputy. (2) The Taiyue area and the area east of the southern section of the Tongpu Railway are under the command of Chen Geng, with Han Jun and Sun Dingguo as his deputies. (3) The northern section of the Pinghan Railway, the area north of the Zhengtai Railway, and the area east of the northern section of the Tongpu Railway are under the command of Nie Rongzhen, with Chen Zhengxiang as his deputy.

### Qian Dajun Urges Wu Guozhen to Come Soon; Various Bureaus and Departments of the Municipal Government Are Rushing to Hand Over; Li Jilan, Commander-in-Chief of the Songhu Garrison, Also Resigns

[Report from Our Newspaper] Wu Guozhen's appointment as the new Mayor of Shanghai was approved by the routine meeting of the Executive Yuan yesterday morning. It is rumored that Wu may come to Shanghai to take office on the 20th of this month, and all sectors of the city will express a warm welcome. Yesterday, Mayor Qian specially sent a telegram urging him to come soon. The original telegram reads: "Nanjing Propaganda Minister Wu Guozhen Brother Xun Jian, Secret, Reading the newspaper that the Central Government appointed you as Mayor of Shanghai, what a welcome! I hope you will come soon, so that I can immediately hand over. Sincerely telegram congratulations, and express my sincere feelings. Brother Qian Dajun Chen Han." He also telegraphed President Song of the Executive Yuan, requesting to resign from the position of Chairman of the Housing Allocation Committee for Shanghai Agencies of the Executive Yuan. The original text is as follows: "Nanjing Executive Yuan President Song Jun Jian; I sincerely resign from the position of Mayor of Shanghai. I am sure you will approve. All members of the Housing Allocation Committee for Shanghai Agencies of the Executive Yuan are requested to quickly assign personnel to take over. Before the assignment, Deputy Director Peng will be responsible for presiding. I respectfully ask you to consider this. Your humble servant Qian Dajun Chen Han."

According to our reporter, Mayor Qian may be appointed as the Chief Aide-de-Camp of the National Government. All sectors of society greatly admire Mayor Qian's efforts in reorganizing this large city in a difficult and complex environment. Now that he is leaving, they also feel reluctant.

In addition, the resignations of the Municipal Government Secretary-General Shen Shihua, Director of the Finance Bureau Pu Zhengdong, Director of the Health Bureau Yu Songjun, and Director of the Land Administration Bureau Chen Shiquan have all been approved. After being approved by the central government, Deputy Mayor He De'an was appointed as Secretary-General, Gu Chunfan, the current Deputy Director of the Postal Administration, was appointed as Director of the Finance Bureau. Mr. Gu is an expert in finance and economics and has represented China at the World Monetary Conference. Zhu Ping, the former Director of the Land Bureau of Jiangsu Province, was appointed as Director of the Land Administration Bureau. Mr. Zhu has outstanding research on land issues and has served as a professor in the Land Administration Department of the Central Political School and other positions. The newly appointed Director of the Health Bureau, Li Ting'an, is a public health expert and served as Director of the Shanghai Health Bureau in 1937. It is reported that Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Zhao Zukang, Director of the Public Works Bureau, and Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, will not be changed. Currently, all bureaus and departments of the Municipal Government have received orders from the Mayor to rush to handle the handover matters. The handover method is that the various departments and themselves should prepare a detailed list of assets, number of personnel, and all files, and send them to the Secretariat for collection. The bureaus that have been ordered to be transferred should directly hand over to the respective successors without going through the Municipal Government. The bureaus and departments that have not been changed should also go through the clearing procedures, which is the so-called "fake handover." All members of the Municipal Government have been busy recently organizing the handover work, hoping to complete it within two or three days. Zhu Xubai, Director of the News Department, also submitted his resignation to the Mayor yesterday. Changes in the department will be approved directly by the Central Propaganda Department.

It is reliably learned that Li Jilan, Commander-in-Chief of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, is also resigning from his post. Because Shanghai is the only metropolis in the country, the environment is special, and personnel are complicated. It is necessary to have a firm grasp and clear understanding before any recommendations can be made. After finishing his speech, he clasped his hands and thanked the reporters, smiling and saluting as he walked out of the meeting hall. The reporters still followed him closely, and only dispersed after seeing Mr. Wu off in a car. According to the newly appointed Mayor of Shanghai, Wu Guozhen, who told this newspaper's reporter, he will go to Shanghai to take office after completing the handover, which should not take more than a week. The three newly appointed Directors of the Shanghai Finance, Land Administration, and Health Bureaus will also take office at the same time. He believes that there are many things to be done in Shanghai, but after more than half a year of continuous planning by Mayor Qian, there is already a track to follow. He believes that the Mayor is a public servant of the people, and after taking office, he must work for the master with sincerity and integrity, and work hard for the country with loyalty and honesty. He solemnly instructed the reporter of this newspaper, wishing to use a corner of this newspaper to convey to the elders of Shanghai that Wu Guozhen worked tirelessly as Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Propaganda for the country. Wu Guozhen has been appointed as the Mayor of Shanghai to sympathize with the millions of citizens who have suffered more than eight years of deception and oppression. "Governance is not about many words," but about doing more things. Finally, Wu also instructed and instructed that his father-in-law was Huang Puguan, and his wife's name was Huang Zhuoqun. There was an error in yesterday's newspaper, which shows that he is careful and realistic.

### Traitor Deng Zuyu Publicly Tried in Nanjing; Traitor Lin Bosheng Scheduled to Be Tried on the 25th

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] The Capital High Court publicly tried Deng Zuyu, who once held important puppet positions such as puppet governor of Jiangxi Province and puppet chief of the Capital Police Department, at 2:00 PM today.

Traitor Deng wore a dark blue striped long robe and black leather shoes, with a fat head and big ears. When he was taken from the waiting room to the courtroom, the audience was packed.

After standing in the defendant's column, the muscles on his face trembled, unable to overcome his fear. Deng is from Jiangxi, 56 years old, and lives at No. 21 Shixiang Lane, Zhongzheng Road, Nanjing. It is said that after the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, he took his family to seek refuge, and all his property was lost. On December 26, 1937, he returned to Shanghai from Taizhou Rugao, extremely embarrassed. Then, in February 1938, he was introduced by Chen Renhe (i.e., Chen Qun) to participate in the Maintenance Association. In October of the same year, he served as the Education Director of the Puppet Police School, and later as the Puppet Governor of Jiangxi Province and the Puppet Chief of the Capital Police Department, but he resigned after only six months. Traitor Deng also claimed that he had done counter-espionage work, and during his tenure as the puppet director, he released patriotic people and submitted documents. Finally, when asked about his family, Deng replied that he had more than 20 people, including one wife, two concubines, three sons, and four daughters. Because the case is complex and requires further collection of witness testimony and special testimony, there was no debate. At 3:30 PM, the court ordered a postponement for a retrial, and Traitor Deng was taken back into custody.

[Central News Agency, Hengyang, 14th] Dr. Li Gan, the representative of the Executive Yuan of Harriman, told reporters today that the severe disaster situation he saw in Hengyang was far more profound than rumored. The disaster is so severe that there is no other way but to rush transport of materials and strengthen rescue efforts.

### Zhu Shiming Meets with Pauley Again to Discuss Japan's Reparations to China; The United Nations Agrees to Use Wartime Industries as Reparations

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 14th] Lieutenant General Zhu Shiming, head of the Chinese delegation to Japan, met with Pauley, the US reparations representative, again this morning with experts and others to discuss Japan's reparations to China. Zhu had previously spoken to Pauley once yesterday afternoon.

[United Press, Washington, 13th] The United Nations has agreed to use most of Japan's wartime industries as reparations for the countries concerned. Representatives of the eleven nations of the United Nations Far East Commission unanimously decided today to use a large portion of Japan's army and navy arsenals, aircraft, and light metal industries as "temporary" reparations, with some manufactured goods being exempted. The Committee has now decided to leave out considerable rotating and towing equipment in the light metal industry to maintain the production of 25,000 tons of aluminum metal per year. Ten industrial companies and three companies, Mitsui, Sumitomo, Kuhara, Taihei, Yasuda, ---, and Nakajima, which had fostered Japanese aggression, will be confiscated as reparations. McConnell, the US representative and chairman of the committee, said: The committee's detailed agreement on Japan's final reparations policy is difficult to decide for the time being. According to McConnell and other representatives of the committee, the three types of reparations items opened today are clearly those that the United Nations will not allow Japan to retain. The final disposition of other industries can only be decided after the United Nations agrees on which industries Japan is allowed to retain. Today's decision is based on the various suggestions originally put forward by Pauley, the US reparations expert, to President Truman.

### Yellow River Project Obstructed; Communist Army Insists on Allowing Temporary Closure of the Breach; Both Sides Send Representatives to Beijing to Continue Negotiations

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 13th] The Yellow River closure and embankment restoration project is on the verge of being abandoned halfway due to the repeated insistence of the Communist army representatives on the request to "only allow the restoration of the embankment and temporarily suspend the closure of the breach." If it fails completely, the countless hundreds of millions of funds spent by the central government, the heavy burden borne by the people of Henan Province, and the human and material assistance of international friends will all be wasted, causing even deeper suffering to the vast people suffering from the Yellow River disaster. The negotiations between the Yellow River Commission and the Communist Party representatives have clearly failed to achieve a satisfactory new record. The commission believes that this is related to the stability and security of half of the country and must seek a thorough solution. Therefore, it sent consultants and senior staff Chen Shuzeng and Zhang Jichun, accompanied by Communist army representatives Zhao Mingfu and Wang Xiaoyi, to Beijing by car on the morning of the 12th to continue negotiations and request the central government to make a final decision. However, the closure work at Huayuankou is still continuing and has not been suspended.

It is said that he is suffering from a brain tumor and needs long-term rest. However, rumors that he has completely relinquished political affairs are all speculation.

Hangzhou

Crackdown on Merchants Deceiving Travelers

Recently in Hangzhou, some unscrupulous motor vehicle merchants have been exploiting the difficulties in road transportation and the lack of vehicles. Under the guise of business, they post advertisements in hotels to solicit passengers, collect fares, and issue tickets, only for the passengers and vehicles to disappear without a trace. Many have been deceived. The Provincial Security Headquarters, in conjunction with the municipal government, the provincial police department, and the transportation office, have agreed on measures to crack down on such activities. In the future, any merchant intending to transport passengers must sell tickets at the Transportation Office's Hubin Station. Joint patrol stations will be established at the Qingtai Gate, Xiaohe, and Songmuchang, three key transportation points, by various agencies to crack down on illegal activities by vehicle merchants and to inspect driver's licenses and vehicle registrations.

The Railway Bureau Decides to Repair the Ningbo-Cao'e Section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway First: The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway has historically only consisted of the section from Hangzhou to Shanghai and the section from Ningbo to the Cao'e River.

In 1936, the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau constructed a railway track to realize the connection from Shanghai to Ningbo, which was completed in the autumn of 1937. Subsequently, after Hangzhou was occupied by the enemy forces, the section from Xixing to the Cao'e River was ordered to be destroyed first. During the Ningbo "914 Incident," the Cao'e River to Ningbo section was also ordered to be destroyed. To date, it has not been repaired. Currently, the Railway Bureau, considering that the full restoration of the railway is difficult, has decided to repair the Ningbo-Cao'e section first, with work commencing on June 1st.

Editorial

### Recognizing the Crux of the Political Impasse

With Special Envoy Marshall returning to Nanjing along with the National Government, and starting meetings with the municipal government the day before yesterday, followed by discussions with Zhou Enlai, the representative of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the atmosphere in the capital has turned optimistic regarding the overall situation in China. It is generally believed that once the representatives of the various parties arrive in Nanjing, the comprehensive group meeting of the Political Consultative Council (PCC) can be reopened. This is, of course, an encouraging sign, but given that the CCP is still insisting on a ceasefire in the Northeast as a condition for reopening negotiations, and is simultaneously launching offensives everywhere in North China and along the lines, it seems that we cannot be too optimistic just yet.

I recall that when the PCC opened in Chongqing in January, it was precisely when the nationwide conflicts were declared to have ceased, allowing for consultations to proceed in a peaceful atmosphere. After more than twenty days of discussions, five agreements were reached with the unanimous support of various parties, factions, and social elites. The main principles of the agreements were: (1) The nationalization of the military, implementing a basic plan for the reorganization and integration of troops, including the incorporation of CCP forces into the National Army, to ensure domestic peace; (2) The democratization of politics, starting with the formation of a national government inclusive of individuals from various parties and factions, followed by the convening of a National Assembly on May 5th to enact a constitution and embark on the path of democratic politics. However, in the three months since the PCC closed, not only have the agreements it passed not seen concrete implementation, but the two major principles of military nationalization and political democracy, which were unanimously hoped for by the entire nation, seem to have been completely forgotten by one or two parties. Moreover, the political situation has deteriorated, with the CCP attempting to expand its territory everywhere, without end or limit. For example, regarding the Northeast issue, after the Soviet army withdrew, the central government's troops went to take over, which was perfectly legitimate and there should be no objections. Unexpectedly, a so-called "Democratic Allied Army" appeared in the Northeast, and the so-called "Battle of Changchun and Harbin" occurred, plunging the uncontroversial takeover of the Northeast into a stalemate. Similarly, in the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway and the Subei region, CCP troops are constantly encroaching, causing the local people to suffer terribly, with no avenue for redress. In the political sphere, the CCP has rigid opinions regarding the constitutional draft. Regarding the National Assembly and the reorganization of the national government, it first argued over the number of representatives and members of the national government, and later simply refused to provide a list, citing the Northeast issue as an excuse. As a result, the National Assembly, which was supposed to convene on May 5th, had to be postponed again, and the reorganization of the government could not be started.

If this political impasse is not quickly remedied, it is likely to lead to an unprecedented crisis in the long run. People who care about the times and love the country should be vigilant, face reality, and not just engage in empty talk, remain aloof, and be indifferent to right and wrong. We believe that the people who are third parties should not continue to be confused, but must first recognize where the crux of the current political impasse lies. By understanding this, a correct remedy can be prescribed, forcing those who violate the will of the people to fulfill their promises.

The greatest achievement of the PCC was undoubtedly the formulation of a basic plan for the reorganization and integration of the military, because a unified military and command are absolutely necessary to put the country's politics on the right track. And the fundamental crux of the former political impasse lies in the fact that this plan has not been thoroughly implemented. The plan originally stipulated that it would be implemented in stages over eighteen months, with the aim of reducing military spending, promoting national economic construction, and establishing an army sufficient to defend the country. At the end of twelve months, the national army should consist of one hundred and eight divisions, of which eighteen divisions would be formed by CCP troops and ninety divisions would be formed by government troops; and within six months after the twelve-month period, the government army should be further reduced to fifty divisions, and the CCP army should be further reduced to ten divisions. At the same time, a military mediation executive department was to be organized by government representative Zheng Jiemin, CCP representative Ye Jianying, and American representative Robinson, to go to various military standoff locations in the north to inspect and realize peace and restore transportation. According to this, all parts of the country, whether it is the Northeast, North China, Central China, or South China, should maintain the state of affairs when the ceasefire order took effect on January 13th this year, and no movement should be allowed. But everyone knows that the situation in various places now is very different from what it was at that time. Zhou Enlai even said: "Since the signing of this agreement, the situation in the Northeast has changed." In his opinion, the plan for the reorganization and integration of the military is no longer applicable to the Northeast. A plan negotiated and established by all parties and factions in the country can actually be unilaterally abandoned by the CCP, and torn up by force. So why bother with hypocritical negotiations? Therefore, the main reason for the current political impasse is that the agreement of the PCC has become merely a statement of intent, without any binding force. In other words, the solemn PCC lacks a strong institution to enforce the agreements. Although there is a military mediation executive department, with the participation of American representatives, to inspect various places, it is only inspection. There is a lack of a coercive force. There is no talk of mediation, let alone execution. For example, the executive group has been to North China, Central China, the Northeast, and the Subei region, but how many tasks have been carried out? And why not frankly announce to the Chinese people the truth about which side violated the order and which side obeyed it? Even a fair announcement is not dared to be made. Is there still the power to mediate? Is there still the power to implement punishment? The most bizarre thing is that when the executive group arrived in Subei, it was refused "entrance" by the CCP. How can such an executive group be expected to enforce the ceasefire order? Recently, there was no conflict in Hubei Province, but the CCP suddenly shouted loudly that the government army was surrounding the CCP army, and that there would be a large-scale war in Central China, and demanded that the executive group go to inspect. Later, the three-person group actually went, but what is the truth about the CCP's propaganda? Why is the three-person group silent? Also, the Northeast was originally not within the scope of mediation, but the Communist army first asked for mediation, and after forcibly occupying Changchun, the mediation department was ordered to send a group there. Why did the CCP say that there was no war in Changchun and that it was not necessary to go? We, the people, are looking forward day and night to the various parties who are planning for the country being able to jointly fulfill their promises and start the work of peaceful nation-building as soon as possible. Therefore, in our deep suffering, we endure the pain and put forward the following suggestions:

First, the plan for the reorganization and integration of the military should not only be quickly and universally implemented, and equally applicable to the Northeast, but also advocated to start with the Northeast first, and it is best to complete the reorganization in the shortest possible time. There is absolutely no reason for the CCP to ask for revisions. Only in this way can there be hope for a solution to the Northeast problem. And only from whether this plan is implemented can we see whether one side is sincerely seeking peace.

Second, the power of the executive group must be strengthened. It must not only have the power to enforce orders, but also the power to punish those who violate the ceasefire order of January 10th, regardless of which side of the troops violates the order. We hope that the various parties who are planning for the country will first reflect on whether their troops have stopped at the defense lines on January 13th, and then guarantee that their troops will immediately and absolutely follow the orders issued by the military mediation executive department. If there is mediation while there is conflict, mediation today and conflict tomorrow, conflict without end, mediation without end, it will be in vain, and it is definitely not the hope of the people.

Third, up to now, almost all conflicts in various places have been provoked by the CCP, but once the purpose of provocation is achieved, the CCP immediately chants "unconditional ceasefire," wanting the government and mediators to recognize its accomplished facts. The CCP's methods are indeed extremely "brilliant," but it will not be able to cover the eyes and ears of the people of the world with one hand. The common people will never allow any party to specialize in playing tricks, and today's common people are definitely not the "A Dou" of the past.

Fourth, the crux of the problem is that the military reorganization plan has not been implemented, resulting in the endless conflicts in the Northeast, North China, and Subei. Which side should be responsible for this? Who has not fulfilled their promise? Who is provoking? And who started first? The military mediation executive department should first investigate and clarify these questions and inform the people of the country so that everyone knows where right and wrong lie. If right and wrong are not discussed in the world, and only perfunctory treatment is given, things cannot be reasonably resolved, because "reason" is the reason for "right and wrong." If right and wrong are unclear, black and white are indistinguishable, and everyone is confused and only seeks temporary peace, then justice and fairness will be gone, and "reason" can no longer be discussed. What "reasonable" way is there to resolve the situation?

In short, if we want to break the current political impasse, we must strengthen the institution for implementing the military reorganization plan and start from the fair concept of distinguishing right from wrong. Only in this way can we make all parties unable to avoid fulfilling their promises and stopping the conflict. Only in this way can negotiations between the government and the CCP have a bright future. If the people cannot see this point, individuals ignore this key, and only want to be a peacemaker between the government and the CCP without being able to enforce reasonable agreements, then China will suffer and the people will suffer!

### Settling a Blood Debt of Fourteen Years; Japanese War Criminals Cannot Escape Censure; Xiang Zhe, Prosecutor, Attended the International Tribunal for the First Time Yesterday, Requesting Severe Sanctions Against the Defendants

[Our Tokyo Correspondent, 14th]: This afternoon, the Japanese War Crimes Tribunal continued to debate the issue of individually trying the war criminals. Chinese Prosecutor Xiang Zhejun made a statement refuting the argument by the Japanese defense lawyers that there was no war between China and Japan before 1941. He stated that since 1931, the Chinese people have suffered from the persecution of Japanese war criminals. These war criminals must be severely sanctioned, otherwise, not only will peace not be maintained, but the Japanese people will continue to suffer from their poison.

Also today, former Foreign Minister Togo appeared in court and gave a wry smile to his German wife.

[United Press, Tokyo, 14th]: Chinese Prosecutor Xiang Zhejun of the Far East International Military Tribunal made his first appearance in court today. It is reported that China has suffered greatly from the devastation caused by Japanese war criminals, and justice will now be served in the international military tribunal. Since September 18, 1931, countless Chinese soldiers and civilians have been killed by the Japanese. Japanese leaders incited the people to oppress China. It is hoped that the court will be able to sentence the 28 defendants within a reasonable time and impose the punishment they deserve.

### American Lawyer Makes Preposterous Arguments, Defending Four Defendants, Attempting to Exculpate Them from the Crime of Mass Murder

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 14th]: The Far East International Tribunal continued to hold hearings today, trying Japanese war criminals. The chief American defense lawyer, Blakeney, representing four Japanese war criminals, namely former Prime Minister Hiranuma Kiichiro, former Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke, former Foreign Minister (signer of the surrender document) Shigemitsu Mamoru, and former Kwantung Army Commander Umezu Yoshijiro, challenged the qualification of the tribunal. Mr. Blakeney cited three reasons: (1) The Supreme Court authorities proved that war is not a criminal act; (2) Killing enemies in war is not murder, and is no worse than the atomic bombing of Hiroshima; (3) If international treaties are violated, the Tokyo Tribunal has no jurisdiction to try the case, because the judges and prosecutors of this tribunal all represent the victorious countries. Chief Prosecutor Keenan rebutted, saying that the tribunal is composed of representatives of the Allied countries, and is in fact equal to a world court, except for the representatives of the Axis countries. If we want to form a court composed of neutral countries at this time, it would be difficult to find them even by searching the earth, unless we ask another planet. Australian Prosecutor Mansfield said that there should be a distinction between just and unjust wars, and between aggressive and defensive wars. Killing enemies in an unjust war is murder.

### Demonstrations by Starving People in Front of the Imperial Palace; Demanding the Emperor to Distribute Food

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 14th]: Today, 700 Japanese people, holding red flags and singing the Internationale, attempted to storm the Imperial Palace to petition. This group arrived at the palace gate at 11:15 AM, shouting "We demand the Emperor to distribute food." The guards tried to stop them without success, and finally allowed five representatives to enter, but the five representatives only met with representatives of the Ministry of the Imperial Household, who relayed their demands. The other demonstrators waited outside the gate until 5:30 PM, and then dispersed. On the same day, demonstrations surged like a tide in the afternoon, with the number of participants reaching one million. According to one of the representatives who entered the palace, "During the war, we were ready to die for the Emperor. Now the Emperor allows us to starve to death. How can he bear it?" A Japanese policeman replied, "If you want food, you'd better ask General MacArthur."

### Growing Rifts in the U.S. State Department Affect Diplomatic Policy; The Traditional Old and New Factions Continue to Clash; The Director of the Sino-American Intelligence Division Resigns as a Result

[United Press, Washington, 13th]: The internal rifts within the U.S. State Department are growing daily, which is bound to have a serious impact on various major U.S. foreign policies. Secretary of State Byrnes will have to deal with this major issue when he returns from Paris. The first to resign as a result of this infighting was Colonel McCormack, Director of the Sino-American Intelligence Division. His resignation is said to be due to opposition within the State Department, which rendered him helpless. The various departments of the State Department are now speculating, either that someone will follow suit and resign, or that there will be a major reshuffle this year. The speculation about who might resign is generally focused on Under Secretary of State Acheson, Assistant Secretary of State Clayton, and McCormack's successor, Rongjie. The crux of the infighting is the struggle between the traditional old and new factions, that is, the professional diplomats and the relatively new figures. The professional diplomats believe that the various departments of U.S. foreign relations should be presided over by them, so that a certain policy can be fully implemented from beginning to end, without changing halfway. Other non-professional diplomats, mostly lawyers and economists, believe that the United States must develop a progressive diplomatic policy line, and cannot be limited to what the diplomats provide. If the United States cannot promote a viable peace, then who in the world can shoulder this heavy responsibility? To accomplish this goal, these people must sincerely try to cooperate with the Soviet Union. Conversely, the professional diplomats advocate taking a firm stance against the Soviet Union's westward expansion of its influence. Acheson, Clayton, and Rongjie are all non-professional diplomats in the State Department (former Ambassador to China Hurley once referred to Acheson as a professional diplomat).

### Senator Presents Evidence: US Military Aircraft Security Lax; Legislative Yuan Plans to Revise Espionage Law

[United Press Washington, 13th] Senator Wiley revealed startling evidence today at a closed-door meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee, exposing the lax security of US military aircraft. Wiley also stated: specialized engineering knowledge and secret weapons both hold significant military secret value. The committee is currently planning to draft a bill by the 17th of this month to revise the 30-year-old Espionage Act, adapting it for modern secrets concerning radar and atomic bombs. The committee also received the following testimonies: (1) The Soviet Union once intended to sign a contract with a certain electrical appliance manufacturing company, stipulating that the company allow Soviet engineers to intern at their factories. (2) The US Department of Commerce arbitrarily sold many specialized records, including those seized from Germany. Although US Army and Navy authorities did not consider these records confidential, the Soviet Union and France did not agree.

According to Committee Chairman Eastman, "Parts considered non-confidential, if collected, become confidential information." The US government should establish a special bureau to review contracts signed by foreign governments in the US.

### British Delegation to Issue Statement: Announcing Indian Independence Timeline; No Need for Frustration Over Round Table Conference Breakdown; Gandhi Urges Indians to Strive for Freedom

[Report from Our Newspaper] London, 14th Broadcast: Viceroy Wavell and the British Cabinet Delegation returned to New Delhi today. The Simla Round Table Conference has completely failed. Britain and India are scheduled to issue a formal statement on Thursday.

[Reuters Simla, 14th] Information gleaned from the Congress Party yesterday: The statement to be issued by the British Cabinet Delegation will touch upon the issue of Indian independence and will declare a tentative timeline for complete Indian independence.

### Hoover Submits Report After Inspecting World Famine; China Needs at Least 500,000 Tons of Grain Monthly; Hoover Ordered to Seek Cooperation in South America

[Reuters Washington, 14th] President Truman's Food Envoy Hoover, upon returning to the country after inspecting various famine-stricken areas around the world, submitted a report to the President estimating that China needs 870,000 tons of grain from May 1st to the end of September. (According to a United Press report, Hoover told reporters that China's grain assistance needs at least 500,000 tons per month during this period, but he can only promise to obtain 200,000 tons per month. According to Chinese official opinion, this is the maximum amount that can be transported into the most severely famine-stricken areas of the country.) Japan also needs 870,000 tons, but Japan's needs are calculated based on transportation limitations, not its minimum need.

### Four Powers Reach Agreement on Italian Southern Border; Byrnes Proposes New Suggestions on Italian Colonies and German Issues

[Report from Our Newspaper] London, 14th Broadcast: The Council of Foreign Ministers continued to meet this morning to discuss the issues of the treaty with Italy and Trieste. It is rumored that the four foreign ministers have reached a considerable agreement on the border issue between Italy and Yugoslavia.

[United Press Paris, 14th] Reliable sources claimed today that the representatives of Britain and France at the Council of Foreign Ministers are willing to accept the internationalization of the port of Trieste in order to salvage the deadlock in the meeting. However, the United States and the Soviet Union firmly opposed it and were unwilling to concede. The United States originally supported Britain and France on this issue, but now its opinion is different, firmly insisting that the port of Trieste should remain under Italian control. The Soviet Union insists that the port of Trieste should be ceded to Yugoslavia, and it is also extremely firm. US officials said that this issue is the main crux of the failure to reach an agreement on the treaty with Italy.

[United Press Paris, 13th] The four foreign ministers have now reopened negotiations to decide the issue of when to convene a peace conference. US Secretary of State Byrnes today suggested assigning a temporary four-power committee to go to Germany to investigate the country's disarmament situation.

Britain admitted that 120,000 former German soldiers are still retained in the forces necessary for occupation work.

[United Press Paris, 13th] US Secretary of State Byrnes made suggestions in order to eliminate disagreements on the issue of Italian colonies and to determine the extent of German disarmament. Byrnes's suggestion is: for the next year, the Council of Foreign Ministers itself will manage the Italian colonies. If the various

The defendants murdered 70,000 prisoners in the concentration camp and are unforgivable. At the same time, the military court will try 75 members of the Nazi stormtroopers at the end of this week, who massacred US soldiers in the Battle of the Ardennes in France.

### Atomic Bomb Test Causing Earthquake? Warping Terrain? US Experts Believe Concerns Are Unnecessary

[United Press Washington, 13th] Dr. Wulou, a physics professor at Yale University, sent a letter to the New York Times, fearing that testing atomic bombs at Bikini Atoll would cause earthquakes, and the harm would be unimaginable. Therefore, he believed that choosing the island as a test site was unwise. His theoretical concern is that the atomic bomb explosion may break through the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, causing seawater to rush in and come into contact with the Earth's core heat, leading to continuous earthquakes. The magnitude of the seismic force would be enough to make the Earth lose its balance, and the terrain would be warped. This continuous earthquake would also be enough to cause a tsunami, causing the tide to rise to a height of one mile or more. A reporter today asked Rear Admiral Parsons, Deputy Commander of the Army and Navy Test Forces, and Rear Admiral Level, an oceanographer and test consultant, about this matter. These two experts checked the records and statistics of earthquakes, submarine geography, and huge explosions to prove that Dr. Wulou's theory was unfounded and did not warrant attention. Their explanation is as follows:

(1) Although the power of a man-made atomic bomb explosion is astonishing, compared with natural earthquakes or ground fissures, it is nothing more than a small witch seeing a great witch. The energy generated by one major earthquake is about 100,000 times greater than that generated by one atomic bomb. The energy generated by an earthquake all enters the ground, while only one-thousandth of the energy generated by an atomic bomb is absorbed into the ground. Based on this calculation, the energy generated by a major earthquake is about 100 million times greater than the energy generated by an atomic bomb.

(2) Assuming that there is a volcanic layer in the Bikini area (however, the test supervisors do not make this assumption), then the atomic bomb is exploded slightly below the water surface during the second test, and this volcanic layer is still more than 21,000 feet below the explosion site. 21,000 feet is the height of Bikini Atoll from the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. The reef is located on the top of a high peak. Even if the high peak was once an active volcano, its volcanic heart must have solidified early. The high peak has now become hard rock, and the top and slopes are covered with a thick layer of coral.

(3) It is credible that there are no active volcanoes within 2,000 miles around Bikini.

(4) If it is said that volcanic eruptions may warp the terrain, then "this Earth is so sensitive, and so many past tsunamis and earthquakes must have been enough to make it suffer." Taking the Krakatoa land fissure in the Sumatra and Java area in 1883 as an example, when seawater seeped into the super-ripe base under the island, the stone that exploded was 14 square miles. Krakatoa is located at 6 degrees south of the equator. If land fissures may affect the terrain, then the land fissure there is enough to affect the rotation of the earth. If there is still no resolution within this year, this issue will be submitted to the United Nations organization. In addition, the four countries should jointly form a committee, authorized by the Allied Control Council for Germany, to go to the four occupation zones of Germany to inspect the extent to which Germany has been disarmed.

### Italian New King Awards Decorations to Our Charge d'Affaires to Italy

Former King Changes Title to Count of Pollenzo

[Central News Agency London, 13th] The new King of Italy, Umberto II, received Xue Guangqian, our charge d'affaires to Italy, in Rome yesterday and awarded him the Grand Officer Decoration. The newly appointed Ambassador to Italy, Yu Junji, is expected to arrive in Rome around the 23rd.

[Central News Agency New York, 13th Dispatch] Our Ambassador to Italy, Yu Junji, is scheduled to take a ship to Southampton on the 13th night and transfer to Rome. Need. The Philippines needs 60,000 tons during the same period, and Korea also needs 110,000 tons. The minimum need for the Indian Ocean region during the same period is 886,000 tons. Hoover opposed the United States bearing full responsibility for famine relief. Although the Western Hemisphere should do its best to assist, the Indian Ocean region should also mobilize its resources as much as possible.

Hoover's report stated that from May 1st to September 30th, the world needs a total of 14,484,400 tons of food. The possible supply during the same period is 10,897,700 tons, so there is a shortage of approximately 3,600,000 tons. Hoover further stated at a press conference that in order to avoid collective famine, continuous efforts are needed. He believes that by the end of August, if the surplus countries can step up their savings and maintain a spirit of cooperation, then the remaining shortfall will not be difficult to make up for the most part.

[Reuters Washington, 14th] Hoover, at the request of President Truman, will visit South America as a food envoy to seek the assistance of South American countries in relieving the world famine.

### Special Agents Commit Heinous Crimes; Held Important Positions in Puppet Organizations; Arch-Traitor Su Chengde on Trial; Secretly Murdered Party Committee Martyr Zhang Xiaotong; Mrs. Zhang Testifies in Court, Weeping

[Report from Our Newspaper] At 8:50 AM yesterday morning, Chief Judge Xiao Bianfen of the High Court presided over the trial of arch-traitor Su Chengde in the newly established Special Criminal Court on the third floor of the Shanghai Prison in Tilanqiao. Su Chengde was from Jining, Shandong, 46 years old, and lived at 540 Haige Road. He successively served as the Deputy Captain of the Action Team of the Investigation Section of the Central Party Headquarters, and the Director of the Investigation Sections of the Party Headquarters of Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo, and the two routes. In September of the Republic of China's 28th year (1939), he was secretly active in Shanghai and was captured by the enemy puppets to "76", where he was persuaded by traitor Zhou Fohai to join the puppet organization. He initially served as the Director of the Fourth Division of the Puppet Special Agent Headquarters, handling personnel adjustments. In less than a month, he was transferred to the Nanjing District Director of the department, responsible for the security of the puppet government's return to the capital, and helping to find houses for various agencies, and maintaining local security. The district also had a detention center, detaining arrested underground workers. In the 29th year (1940), Zhang Xiaotong, a former member of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, was secretly active in Shanghai, was arrested by the enemy and escorted to the detention center, and was secretly executed by the puppet enemy's headquarters. Traitor Ding Shijun was sent to supervise the execution. The defendant then ordered Traitor Tong Guozhong and others to strangle him, and the defendant also took a photo to report.

In March of the same year, he was transferred to serve as a puppet Central Supervisory Committee member; in June, he was transferred to serve as the Director of the Special Police Department of the Puppet Police Administration Department, governing special police affairs such as water, railway, forestry, and mining, in addition to the ordinary administrative police, and established a Special Police Training Institute, with the defendant serving as the director concurrently, training the aforementioned special police. In the 30th year (1941), he was transferred to serve as the Director of the Puppet Nanjing Police Department. In February of the 31st year (1942), the position of Director of the Puppet Nanjing Police Department was changed to Superintendent General of the Puppet Capital Police, which was still held by the defendant. In October of the same year, he was transferred to serve as a member of the Puppet Military Affairs Committee. In January of the 32nd year (1943), he was transferred to serve as the Director of the Puppet Political Work Bureau, handling intelligence and special propaganda affairs. He also incorporated a brigade of the 89th Army of Northern Jiangsu into the puppet army to enhance the strength of the puppet regime. In August of the same year, he served as the Deputy Director of the 1st, 3rd, and 2nd Bureaus of the Shanghai Police Bureau, handling Baosjia (collective responsibility system), education, and security, etc., until after the victory, when he was arrested by military agencies. After investigation by the High Prosecutor's Office, the prosecution was filed.

During the interrogation yesterday morning, the defendant was tall and burly, wearing a dark blue serge robe, and tortoise-shell-rimmed glasses, arrogant and unrestrained; the prestige of the puppet secret agent chief had not completely disappeared. He even denied the Zhang Xiaotong murder incident. Chief Judge Xiao then summoned Zhang Xiaotong's widow, Chen Juexian, the principal of the Municipal Dongming Elementary School. According to her testimony, her husband originally worked at the Party Headquarters, and on January 14th of the 19th year (1930), he was arrested by the enemy and his life and death were unknown. When she heard that a memorial service had been held in Chongqing, she learned that he had been murdered. After the victory, Xu Shaoyu of the Military Intelligence Bureau's office in Jiangsu informed her of the place of death, so she took leave to go but did not find the remains. She applied three points in court: (1) Strictly interrogate the traitor Su to find out when Zhang Xiaotong died and where he was buried; (2) Investigate other criminals who instigated the execution of Zhang Xiaotong; (3) Return the blood photo of Zhang Xiaotong stored in the traitor Su's house to keep it for remembrance. Her words were filled with tears and she cried uncontrollably. After summoning several witnesses called by the defendant, the court ordered a rescheduling of the interrogation and the defendant was returned to custody.

Two Indian Traitors Retried

The Special Criminal Court on the second floor of the Tilanqiao High Court retried Indian traitors Nanak Chand and Bope yesterday morning. Nanak Chand participated in the Indian independence movement in his early years and was hunted down by the British government, so he fled to Shanghai. In the winter of the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941), Bose colluded with the Japanese army to organize the Indian Independence League in our occupied areas, leading the Indian community to fight for independence. Nanak Chand served as the chairman. Bope knew Japanese and served as a liaison officer for the enemy. The two traitors made absurd remarks to please the enemy and seized the opportunity to make money. Last year, Indians Wu Huazu, Narunxing, and Huahaweixing, etc., all came to court to testify about their experiences of being harmed. The defendant still tried to shirk responsibility, and said that his assumption of the position was only because of different political views, and that it was for the sake of fighting for independence. The court ordered the defendant to be returned to custody and rescheduled the interrogation.

Supplies Enemy, Harms the Country

The trial continued of Wu Yonghua, Chairman of the Puppet Automobile Parts and Accessories Trade Association, for using automobiles, Chuanpin (brand name), and hardware to supply the enemy, and for purchasing automobile engines for the enemy to manufacture enemy suicide aircraft; and Xu Zhiren, a rice merchant, for purchasing 3,000 piculs of rice for the enemy, for supplying the enemy with supplies. The defendants all claimed that they were forced by the evil forces of the enemy puppets and did not willingly attach themselves to the enemy. After the presiding judge interrogated them one by one, he ordered a rescheduling of the interrogation. The Shanghai Higher Court Prosecutor's Office has completed the investigation of the cases of Dai Yingfu, the puppet Shanghai Education Bureau Director, and Ma Haoqing, who were suspected of being traitors, and has formally filed a public prosecution.

### Tram Workers Demand Increased Base Pay; Restricted by Executive Yuan Order; Social Affairs Bureau Unable to Accept; Orders Labor and Management to Negotiate on Their Own

[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the labor dispute at the tram company, in addition to the issues of sick leave, retirement benefits, and reinstatement of laid-off workers, which have already been resolved, the company has also agreed to other points, such as working six days with one day off, holidays on national commemorative days, and double pay for working on holidays. The only remaining unresolved issue is the labor's demand for an adjustment to base pay. However, because the Executive Yuan has ordered the municipal government that workers' base pay cannot be increased starting in April of this year, the Social Affairs Bureau cannot accept this demand from the labor side. Yesterday, the person in charge on the management side told reporters that they currently have no opinion and are only waiting for the Social Affairs Bureau to mediate and make a decision. The bureau, however, is restricted by regulations and cannot discuss the matter, so it has ordered labor and management to negotiate on their own to find a solution. It is not impossible to consider increasing allowances under a different name.

### Taikoo Line Still Has Not Replaced Foreign Sailors with Chinese

[Our Newspaper's Report] After the resumption of service by the British-owned Taikoo Line steamship company, the Jinan and Fuzhou ships have not yet replaced foreign sailors with Chinese. Despite repeated warnings from the Seamen's Union, the British manager of the company has negotiated with the Seamen's Union several times, but the replacement of foreign sailors has not been implemented, leading to a strike. As a result, the two ships have been in Shanghai for nearly two weeks, and goods have not been unloaded, with exports even further off, resulting in considerable losses. It is reported that the Seamen's Union issued a final warning to the company yesterday. If the issue is not resolved today, it may affect other ships. Currently, in addition to the Jinan and Fuzhou, the company has five ships in Shanghai, including the Hubei, Shandong, and Hanyang, which arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. If the company cannot satisfy the Seamen's Union today, all work may be halted.

### Rescuing Unemployed Workers Is Important; Rescuing Factories Is More Urgent; Wu Kaixian Discusses Convening a Production Conference to Seek Solutions

[Our Newspaper's Report] Mr. Wu Kaixian stated: While rescuing unemployed workers is important, rescuing factories is even more urgent. Only with factories can ways be found to accommodate workers. Therefore, he is joining forces with relevant agencies to prepare for another production conference to seek solutions. The issues proposed for discussion at the conference are: (1) Requesting the government to provide large-scale industrial loans to improve or add to the equipment of private factories and to purchase production materials. (2) Helping and urging factories to improve personnel management. According to current statistics, the number of employees in some factories after the victory has increased by one-third compared to the enemy-puppet period. Now, reduce unnecessary redundant personnel and try to accommodate more workers. (3) Purchasing foreign rice to suppress rice prices. This is a fundamental issue and has a great impact on the future of industry and commerce. (4) Rectifying labor discipline. Mr. Wu also mentioned that after the establishment of the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee, in addition to the meeting already held, another meeting will be convened soon. Furthermore, Mr. Wu accompanied Mr. Zhu Xuefan, the person in charge of the Chinese Labor Association, to Beijing last night to meet with Chairman Chiang, as requested by Chairman Chiang.

### Reinstatement of Unemployed Workers; Symposium Held to Discuss Solutions

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Reinstatement Committee of the Hudong District of this city includes more than 20,000 unemployed workers from various industries such as copper smelting, rubber, chemicals, dyeing and weaving, docks, machinery manufacturing, silk weaving, and timber transportation. These factories were taken over by military and political organs after the victory and have not yet resumed production. At the same time, employed workers have also organized a Reinstatement Promotion Association. They held a meeting on the afternoon of the 9th and resolved eight points for the Bureau's reference, including: (1) Those who have resumed work should expand as much as possible, and those who have not resumed work should resume work within a limited time. Factories sold at auction should resume work within two weeks after the winning bid. Whether each factory can expand or resume work should be investigated and decided by a factory investigation team organized by the attending agencies, and then immediately handled. (2) Before work is resumed, the government should organize a Shanghai Hudong District Unemployed Workers Reception Center to accommodate them. (3) Launch a work resumption movement and raise work resumption funds as a fund for establishing cooperative factories. The government should allocate factory machinery and raw materials to settle unemployed workers. (4) Factories sold at auction should continue working and employ the original unemployed workers. (5) The Enemy-Puppet Property Management Bureau has received a large amount of funds from the disposal of enemy-puppet property and should allocate it as industrial loans.

The Association, together with unemployed workers who came to Shanghai from the rear, held a symposium at the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon with relevant agencies to discuss solutions for the reinstatement of unemployed workers. More than 30 representatives from organizations such as the Shanghai Branch of the "Executive Headquarters," the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Enemy-Puppet Property Management Bureau, the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, China Silk Company, China Textile Company, the Shanghai Office of the Resources Committee, and various labor unions in the Hudong District attended. Mr. Zhao Banfu, Director of the Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, served as chairman. Representatives of unemployed workers requested the Good Relief General Administration to (1) distribute relief supplies, (2) establish a Shanghai Unemployed Workers Reception Center, (3) establish a clinic, and (4) postpone the closing of the Reception Center for unemployed workers who came to Shanghai from the rear. They also requested the factories taken over by various agencies to resume work as soon as possible. After exchanging views, they strongly agreed on several points such as organizing a factory investigation team, and promised to forward other items to the superiors of the agencies for a decision.

The main points of the indictment were recorded in this newspaper on the 7th. At 2:30 PM yesterday, Judge Cao Zuwei opened the Third Criminal Division of the District Court for the first hearing. Wang Guoying had a mannish Western haircut, wore a light gray Western suit, a red and white polka-dot tie, and cream-colored leather shoes. She and the two other defendants, Sun and Zhang, were brought to the defendant's seat by judicial police officers Zhang Ji and Pan Zhupeng. She denied all the fraud described in the indictment, loudly proclaiming that she was wronged. After Judge Cao questioned them one by one, he ordered a postponement of the trial and the defendants were remanded.

Using the Pretext of Bailing Out Traitors to Extort Relatives

Wang is from Beiping, a Muslim, 34 years old, residing at Room 714 of the Jinmen Hotel, claiming to be a specialist from the Accounting Department of the National Government, who came to Shanghai to raise funds for refugee relief. On April 3 of this year, through the introduction of her fellow townsman Sun Gongdu (44 years old) and Zhang Weisheng (47 years old, from Tongzhou, Hebei), she extorted the relatives of Wu Yonghua, who was accused of being a traitor, using the excuse of bailing him out, obtaining a total of 5 million yuan, but Wu was still not released. At the same time, Sun Gongdu wanted to share the stolen money but failed, so he reported to the police station, and Wang was arrested. At the start of the trial, Judge Cao first questioned the witness Ya Yonglu (from Beiping, 50 years old, engaged in transportation). After reading the interrogation record of the police station, Ya Yonglu described that he was asked by Wang Guoying to send a ship ticket to Wang's brother Zuomin at Room 341 of the Oriental Hotel, and he saw Sun Gongdu arguing with Wang's brother and sister-in-law, saying that he would not be able to face his friends if he did not get back 2.5 million yuan. He mediated, but denied that he said that Wang and Sun had jointly defrauded 5 million yuan.

Feigning Surprise in Court; Saying She Didn't Know Them

Subsequently, Yu Xinggeng, the wife of Wu Yonghua (from Yuyao, Zhejiang, 32 years old, residing at 367 Weihaiwei Road), testified that she had seen Wang Guoying twice: once at the Nanlaishun mutton restaurant in Dongxinqiao, and once upstairs at Deji Hardware Store, both introduced by Zhang Weisheng, but she did not speak. She also said that Zhang had been her neighbor for more than ten years, with a straightforward personality, and she believed that Zhang was a good person and would not harm her. Zhang repeatedly assured her that he could bail out her husband Wu Yonghua, and because her child was seriously ill and she hoped to see her husband, she paid 3 million yuan. As for the other 2 million yuan advanced by Deji Hardware Store, she did not know. She also did not know Wang Guoying, nor did she know Sun Gongdu. Then, Xu Zouqiaoying (from Changshu, 40 years old, residing at 333 Weihaiwei Road, her husband is a student of Wu Yonghua) testified that she saw Wang Guoying when Wang went to her house on April 5 to pick up 2 million yuan. At that time, Wang was wearing a blue cheongsam and not a Western suit. Judge Cao then questioned Wang Guoying, and she denied as before, so he ordered the defendants and witnesses to confront each other in court. Wang feigned surprise and said, "I don't know them at all!" However, she could not completely conceal her panic.

Completely Out of Sentiment; Helping Out of Kindness

Judge Cao asked why her brother and sister lived in two hotels in Shanghai. She replied, "He arrived later than me, and the Jingu Hotel had no rooms." He asked, "Are you married?" She replied, "I am married. My husband, Chen Weiyan, is in Hanoi, working as a staff officer at the Hanoi Office of the Ministry of Military Affairs." He asked, "The witnesses have no grudges against you, why would they all say you did this?" She replied, "I received higher education and dare not break the law. This matter is completely unjust." He asked, "How much education did you receive?" She replied, "I graduated from the Journalism Department of Beiping Pingmin University." Subsequently, Judge Cao ordered Wang to confront Sun Gongdu and Zhang Weisheng. Wang claimed that she was subjected to this conspiracy because she had not agreed to Sun Gongdu's investment in business, and Sun claimed that he requested the return of 2.5 million yuan completely out of sentiment, and it must be returned to the original owner, Wang, not for sharing the spoils. As for Zhang Weisheng, he said that he was completely helping out of kindness, how would he dare to defraud? In the defendant's seat, the three defendants argued over conscience, not knowing whose conscience was on them. Judge Cao stopped the interrogation due to time constraints. Wang Guoying strongly demanded to explain the inside story, but Judge Cao stopped her and ordered her to submit a written defense. Wang's lawyer, Ma Nangeng, requested that the defendant be released on bail, but it was not approved. The court ordered another hearing at 2 PM on the 16th.

### False Alarm at the Grand Theatre; Bullets Thrown from Upper Floors; Theatregoer Injured

(Our Newspaper's Report) At around 10 o'clock last night, at the Grand Theatre on Jiujiang Road, 50 to 60 soldiers were watching a play. Suddenly, seven or eight bullets were thrown down from the upper floors. One bullet hit Mrs. Hu (25 years old, residing at No. 1, Alley 602, Huanlong Road), who was in the first seat of the fourth row in the main hall, in the head. Afterwards, in order to prevent the audience from panicking, the theater immediately carried the injured person to the hospital, closed the iron gate tightly, and the Laozha patrol team rushed to the scene. The group leader gave a speech, ordering the person who threw the bullets to come forward, but no one responded. They had to take all the soldiers back to the patrol team in police cars for investigation. It is reported that the bullets were the latest yellow American lead bullets, extremely sharp. According to the person in charge of the theater, it was recently stipulated that soldiers who did not buy tickets to watch the play must go to the third-floor box. The throwing of bullets may have been caused by this dissatisfaction.

The conference discussed tax regulations and generally advocated submitting a request to the government to abolish various taxes levied during the emergency period, such as the excessive profit tax and income tax. As for the various emergency taxes payable in 1945, they should be exempted. This document was personally presented by Mr. Wang to Minister Yu of the Ministry of Finance. Minister Yu said that he would consider it carefully, but it must be forwarded to the Supreme National Defense Council for approval before it can be implemented. Regarding the issue of labor unrest, it is planned to start from the aspect of labor-management welfare, and strive to take into account the welfare of both labor and management as a prerequisite.

### Zhoushan Ship Sails on Fuzhou Line; Dahua Ship Suffers Mechanical Failure En Route

(Our Newspaper's Report) After the resumption of business in Shanghai after the victory, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company first resumed the Shanghai-Ningbo line (i.e., Shanghai to Ningbo). At that time, due to a lack of ships, it chartered the Zhoushan ship from the Zhoushan Company. Yesterday, the ship returned to Shanghai, and because it had long been due, it was taken back by the Zhoushan Company and sailed on the Fuzhou line, also serving Ningbo. It is scheduled to sail on Friday (the 17th) of this week, and the passenger tickets have been sold out. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has no ships to send to the Shanghai-Ningbo line, so it has been suspended in effect. Also, the Dahua ship of the Ping An Shipping Bureau was returning to Shanghai from Ningbo the day before. It dropped anchor at 3 PM and sailed for four hours after leaving Zhenhai, reaching the waters of Ligang Port. The machinery suddenly failed, and the ship anchored in the port, and sent a telegram to Shanghai for help. The Bureau has ordered the Ningbo line to send an escort team to protect it and provide food. The crew and passengers are safe, and the Shanghai Bureau is trying to send a ship to tow it to Shanghai for repairs.

### Pacific Hurricane Advancing Towards Shanghai

### Falsely Claiming Introductions by Celebrities; Forcibly Selling Inferior Goods

### The 12th Anti-Gas Squad Stationed in Huaiyuan Indiscriminately Shoots and Kills a Middle School Student: All Students in Huaiyuan Make a Heartfelt Appeal to the Nation; Middle Schools in Bengbu Automatically Raise Funds for Condolences for Several Consecutive Days

[Our Newspaper's Special Report from Huaiyuan] Huaiyuan has always been the cultural center of northern Anhui. Since the July 7th Incident, it fell into enemy hands, and all construction was completely destroyed. After the victory, the Anhui Provincial Education Association sent Zhou Ping as principal to establish the Provincial Huaiyuan Middle School to help the out-of-school youth in northern Anhui. At that time, because there were no school buildings or equipment, and the Education Bureau had insufficient funds to pay, the school temporarily borrowed the girls' department of the private Huaixi Middle School for classes, and at the same time raised funds and collected equipment to prepare for the construction of the school. Later, after the gentry of the county decided to demolish the abandoned temples inside and outside the county seat, they subsidized the construction. The students of the school, eager to build the school, spared no time, and followed the principal and teachers to move bricks and tiles, which has been going on for more than a day.

Shooting indiscriminately

On the afternoon of the 8th of this month, all the teachers and students went to the Dawang Temple on the north bank of the Wo River to fetch school construction materials, going back and forth between the ferry crossings. At that time, it happened that a large boat sealed by the 12th Anti-Gas Squad of the Military Administration Department stationed in Huaiyuan docked at the shore. The squad immediately conscripted laborers to move goods, forcing the school's workers to participate. The students of the school, feeling they each had their own responsibilities, stepped forward to reason with them, but the soldiers of the squad uttered insults and fired shots, and tied up the school's discipline instructor and many students, immersing them in water and subjecting them to extreme humiliation. At that moment, Principal Zhou Ping rushed from the north bank of the Wo River to the south bank, found the Squad Leader Shang Yong, and politely negotiated, and the incident was calmed down. The students then followed the orders of the teachers and continued to move the materials, without suspecting anything else. Unexpectedly, more than 30 soldiers from the squad rushed out of the city, led by Platoon Leader Hu Zhonggui, armed with live ammunition, as if facing a formidable enemy, and rushed to the "Shuimenkou Ferry Crossing," indiscriminately opening fire. The teachers and students of the school were empty-handed and unable to resist, causing student Yuan Yongkun to die on the spot, Sun Mingde was shot in the abdomen, his condition was critical, Ruan Zhenhua's back was injured and his tendons were broken, leaving him crippled, and Li Guangyi was stabbed with a bayonet. The others who were slightly injured and fell into the water were not few in number.

With Military Discipline, What Reliance on People's Lives?

This horrific scene is infuriating. Recently, all the students of the school issued a declaration, making a heartfelt appeal to the whole country, stating: "The state raises soldiers to protect the territory and secure the people, but now they rely on force to kill students, disregard the law, and treat human lives like grass. The remnants of warlords would not go so far. If the instigators are not strictly investigated and the murderers are not brought to justice, how can military discipline be preserved? What reliance is there on people's lives? All the students of our Provincial Huaiyuan Middle School, for the sake of loving the school, loving the country, and loving our compatriots, vow to do our best to uphold justice, preferring to be shattered like jade rather than remaining whole like tile. We hope that the people of the whole country will uphold justice, protect education, and protect the youth, and give us their support!" and so on.

The Public is Alarmed and Expresses Extreme Indignation

[Our Newspaper's Report from Bengbu] Students from Anhui Provincial Huaiyuan Middle School had a conflict with the 12th Anti-Gas Squad stationed in Huaiyuan on the bank of the Huai River. The squad leader led soldiers to shoot and kill student Yuan Yongkun, and also shot and wounded Sun Mingde, Ruan Zhenhua, and others. It is now known that when the students of various middle schools here heard the news, the public was alarmed and expressed extreme indignation. They were very concerned about the dead and wounded, and starting from the 11th, they continuously and automatically raised funds from students at all levels to send to Huaiyuan Middle School to express condolences to the families of the dead and wounded. The Anti-Gas Squad will probably be completely disarmed in the next few days. (Super)

### Chen Shaoxian Returns from Inspecting Nanyang: Reports on the Situation of Overseas Chinese Education; The Fastest Recovery Among Overseas Chinese Schools in Malaya

[Our Newspaper's Report from Hong Kong] The education community here held a tea party at the Hong Kong Hotel at 3:00 PM on the 8th to welcome Councilor Chen Shaoxian, who recently returned to the country via Hong Kong after visiting Nanyang. Earlier this year, Mr. Chen was ordered to represent the Ministry of Education to inspect overseas Chinese education in various parts of Nanyang and to discuss related issues such as the development of overseas Chinese education with the local governments. More than 40 representatives of principals of various schools in Hong Kong and Kowloon, including Huang Zufen, attended the meeting on this day. Chairman Yuan Shuibo gave a welcoming speech, followed by Chen Shaoxian's report on his observations during the inspection. According to him, the government, in order to urgently understand the situation of overseas Chinese schools in various parts of Nanyang that had been devastated by the enemy for more than three years, and the historical facts of educators sacrificing for justice during the war, sent him to go, and it will be four months now. When he departed from Chongqing, he did not expect the rapid recovery of overseas Chinese schools in Nanyang. Although less than half of the overseas Chinese schools have been restored, the ratio of students is higher than before.

Siam

In the past few years, it was completely controlled by the enemy, and its government regarded our overseas Chinese as enemies. The number of schools that were sealed off and teachers who were arrested was the largest. Since the enemy surrendered, the situation has improved. When we arrived, the anti-Chinese sentiment in Siam was still very strong, so not a single formal school had resumed classes, but there were many "private schools." Recently, our country signed a treaty of friendship with Siam, and it can be restored to the state before the Pacific War. Before the war, there were 169 overseas Chinese schools in Siam.

Burma

In Burma, there were originally 347 overseas Chinese schools. As of January, 63 schools had been restored. In Penang, which belongs to Malaya, there were originally 221 schools, including two middle schools. By February, all of them had been restored, and 90 primary schools had also resumed classes.

Nanyang

Perak had 239 schools, including eight middle schools. As of February, 109 schools had been restored, including two middle schools. Singapore originally had 277 schools, including seven middle schools. As of March, 97 schools had been restored, including two middle schools. Vietnam had 349 schools, including four middle schools, and 150 schools had been restored.

Eager to Serve the Country

Mr. Chen pointed out that the overseas Chinese economy after the war was extremely tight. The rubber, tin ore, and rice industries were all controlled by the government, and military tickets were abolished, causing the propertied to go bankrupt. However, based on years of oppression by the enemy, the overseas Chinese's eagerness to serve the country was even stronger, and their assistance in the development of education was especially doubled. The thriving trend of reading Chinese texts from below can be taken as an example. In the past, many children of overseas Chinese only read foreign texts and did not pay attention to their own national language. This concept has been completely eliminated. As a result, there are more students than before, and there is a phenomenon of supply not meeting demand in a school.

Future Improvements

The areas that need to be improved in overseas Chinese schools in the future are school equipment, teaching methods, overseas Chinese curriculum, and the improvement of students' Chinese proficiency. Mr. Chen also advocated that the government should send more personnel to inspect them and establish liaison agencies in several important places to allow overseas Chinese to gain a better understanding of the educational situation in the motherland. At the same time, teachers who are proficient in Mandarin in the country are also in demand overseas. Mr. Chen also reported that when he inspected various places, he had discussed the improvement of overseas Chinese education with the local governments in a friendly and harmonious atmosphere, especially the most issues raised in Singapore, such as the issue of government subsidies, etc., and received full assistance from friendly countries. Mr. Chen will stay in Hong Kong for a few days before returning to Guangzhou and then to Beijing.

Changing Concepts

[Central News Agency Guangzhou, 13th] This reporter interviewed Councilor Chen Shaoxian, who had just returned from inspecting Nanyang. According to him, the recovery of overseas Chinese schools is fastest in Malaya, followed by Vietnam, and then Burma. The total number of schools restored in the three places is only half of what it was before the war, but the number of students is the same. In Siam, formal schools have not yet been restored, and there are only private schools left. After the war, overseas Chinese all attached importance to their children's education. They felt that China's international status had been improved, so they changed the bad concept of making their children specialize in English before the war, and instead sent their children to overseas Chinese schools. The number of students in each school has now increased sharply.

### US Elementary and Secondary Schools Officially Recognize Newspapers as Supplementary Textbooks: Increasing Students' Interest in the Curriculum

[US News Service New York, 13th] New York City's elementary and secondary schools have officially recognized newspapers as supplementary textbooks. The New York Times and the New York City Board of Education recently jointly held a lecture for teachers on the techniques of using newspapers in the classroom to teach.

In the first few classes, students study newspaper layout, headings, news briefs, cartoons, editorials, etc. The subject of each semester is also taken from the facts published in the newspaper.

[Central News Agency This City Report] Professor Xu Zhongnian of Central University recently passed through Beijing and arrived in Shanghai.

The school's facilities have also increased over the years, and it will not be possible to relocate immediately without a large number of transportation tools. Although 80% of the old school buildings in the capital are still in need of repair, they are still felt to be insufficient for allocation, and efforts are being made to add new buildings. President Wu Youxun has flown from Chongqing to Beijing with Chief of General Affairs Hu Jiajian to actively prepare for the resumption of the school. The first batch of 296 staff and students has already arrived in Hankou by ship, and the second batch of 300 people will also depart soon.

[Our Newspaper's Report from Hangzhou] There are a total of 8,980 publicly funded students in Zhejiang Provincial Normal and Vocational Schools, but the Ministry of Education approved only 6,940 places.

Just as Zhejiang Chairman Shen Honglie went to Beijing on official business, he strongly advocated to the Ministry of Education, and Minister Zhu Jiahua verbally promised to issue it according to the actual number of students in Zhejiang Province. Once the official document arrives, it can be realized. As for the increased funds starting from April that have not yet been allocated, and the schools are short of rice to cook, in urgent need of a fire, the Education Department has asked the Provincial Government to raise some funds in advance to meet the urgent needs.

### Central Bank Intervention Stabilizes Gold Prices Yesterday; U.S. Dollar Follows Gold Market Fluctuations

Gold prices slightly stabilized yesterday. The morning opening was still pushed high to around 1.85 million, but it was only temporary. There were some who sold for profit at the high price, and soon it retreated before rebounding. Ultimately, with increased pressure from the Central Bank, and the U.S. dollar still being sold for supply, it once fell below 1.75 million before maintaining. Around 10 o'clock, the Central Bank allocated according to Article 291 to dealers at a price of 1.78 million. Dealers considered the price too high and requested returns. After that, the situation stabilized, once rebounding to 1.82 million, but soon felt pressure and turned sideways. At noon, it was still hovering around the allocation price. The momentary gold rush has gradually subsided. In the afternoon, over-the-counter sales in silver shops were sluggish, the situation was calm, and there was little change. As a result, the closing price was down 25,000 compared to the previous day, ornamental gold was at 190,000, sycee silver was at 1,700, and silver dollars were offered at 1,100. The informal loan market slightly eased, with interest rates from 1.5 to 1.8 fen.

The foreign exchange U.S. dollar was mediocre, fluctuating with the gold market. After the morning opening, it gradually fell from around 2350 yuan to around 2270 yuan. At noon, it struggled around 2300 yuan. The arbitrage spread widened to around 770 yuan, a result of speculative activity favoring gold over dollars. After the gold market stabilized in the afternoon, the U.S. dollar was still hovering around 2300 yuan. As a result, the closing price was down 20 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong currency was weak and tired, with old bills down 2 yuan and new bills down 5 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate retreated from 420 yuan to 410 yuan. The rupee was offered at 520 yuan. The U.S. exchange rate remained flat.

### Government Bonds Continue to Rise; Chinese Stocks Occasionally Show Promise

Government bonds continued to trend upwards, but the situation was uncertain. Unified Series C opened flat in the morning. After opening, large investors continued to buy actively, gradually pushing the price up to around 7700 yuan. Some of the bulls began to take profits, and the market price subsequently fell back. At noon, it hovered around 7350 yuan. As a result, the closing price was up 250 yuan compared to the previous day. Series A and B also rose 150 yuan, while Series D and E each rose 100 yuan. Some large investors occasionally pulled up Chinese stocks, hoping to salvage the situation, occasionally showing promise. The highest prices were 5250 yuan for Yong Spinning, 4350 yuan for American-Asia, 355 yuan for Jingfu, 295 yuan for Xinguang, and 250 yuan for Qinxing. Large investors were only prepared to support small stocks, and did not pay attention to them, affecting many retail investors and speculative funds. Large stocks also lost support and retreated at noon. All stocks closed at lower prices. As a result, the closing prices of Yong Spinning and American-Asia were not much different from the previous day. Jingfu and the other three small stocks continued to decline slightly. Medium-sized stocks were mixed, while small, unpopular stocks recovered slightly. Veteran stocks were still difficult to push forward, and it was difficult to find buyers due to oversupply. The afternoon situation was quiet. Foreign stocks were still dominated by the intentions of the securities firms. Foreign merchants mostly observed from the sidelines, and eventually also retreated. Yi Spinning conducted transactions above the previous closing price before gradually being suppressed by long positions taking profits and declining slightly. The paper industry was stabilized by speculative buying from small securities firms. The rest closed with slight declines.

### Yarn and Thread Rise Together; Cotton Cloth is Flat

Yesterday, the yarn market saw thread prices rise, and yarn prices remain flat. The morning began with high expectations, and prices for all types of yarn and thread rose by tens of thousands. For example, 42-count Blue Bale initially traded at 2.1 million before falling back to 2.05 million as long positions took profits and sold. As a result, it was still up 100,000 from yesterday's price. The Beijing market saw strong demand for 20-count small and medium-sized yarns, which also rose by 20,000. Sales of Da [illegible] yarn were scarce due to the lack of activity from the Guangdong market, with only a dozen or two pieces being purchased by the Shantou market.

Also reported, the Central Trust Bureau, acting as agent for the Committee for the Disposal of Government Materials and Properties, sold yarn, cloth, rayon and other goods in its second public auction. Among them were four groups of yarn and thread, each group consisting of thirty to forty pieces, all of which were bid for and won by Heng Kang Yarn Company at the highest price, which was not much different from the market price.

The cloth market was not as active as the yarn market. As a result, only the prices of Meiting Shirting, Four Gentlemen Drill, and Damu Official Cloth slightly strengthened, while the prices of the remaining brands remained completely unchanged.

The New York cotton market reported a decline of 5 to 9 points, with near-term American cotton at 27.34 U.S. dollars, and far-term at 27.86 U.S. dollars. The spot price for Midling cotton was 28.15 U.S. dollars. The current cotton market in this city saw high prices and sluggish sales.

### Seafood Sales Sluggish

Sales of all kinds of seafood are quite slow. Upon investigation, the reason is that over-the-counter sales are inactive, shipments continue to arrive, and tight credit conditions are particularly damaging. Fujian fine cinnamon opened as high as 375,000 yuan before falling to 200,000 yuan. The rest of the goods were all in decline.

### Sugar Market Initially Tight, Then Flat; 10,000 Tons of Taiwan Sugar Arriving Soon

The sugar market trend remained tight yesterday. The spot price for middle-grade white granulated sugar was firmer in the morning, initially at 71,000 yuan, with a few sales seen at a price of 74,500 yuan, before slightly easing back to 72,000 yuan to 70,500 yuan, and finally to 69,000 yuan to 70,000 yuan. In the afternoon, it was flat, trading at 69,000 yuan to 68,000 yuan. Retail prices from merchants were 71,200 yuan for middle-grade white granulated sugar, 90,000 yuan to 88,000 yuan for 24-grade coarse granulated sugar, 95,000 yuan for four-and-a-half jun [military] white sugar, 72,300 yuan for three-and-a-half jun white sugar, and 51,200 yuan for Numbered Goods Qing Sugar and 50,000 yuan for Shizhi. A check of the goods sold at auction the day before showed that only 1,500 bags of raw sugar were sold at 56,000 yuan, and over 500 bags of second-grade three-and-a-half cart white sugar at 61,000 yuan.

After the victory, all of the sugar stored in Taiwan Province was taken over by the government and sealed in warehouses in large quantities. Currently, transportation is very difficult due to a severe shortage of transportation equipment. As it stands, it would take more than a year to ship everything out. Chief Chen is very concerned and has ordered all relevant parties to expedite the process and ship 10,000 tons to Shanghai by the 15th of this month.

### New Zhejiang Harvest on the Market; Prices Do Not Cover Costs

The purchasing of spring cocoons of local varieties in Zhejiang, Pingning, Yuhang and other places began on the 12th, with an opening price of 80,000 yuan per dan. Because silkworm farmers did not bring much merchandise, both silkworm companies raised the purchase price to 100,000 yuan, but transactions remained sparse. The conversion rate of local spring cocoons in that area is 300 catties of fresh cocoons to 100 catties of dried cocoons, and the conversion rate of dried cocoons to reeled silk is slightly less than 550 catties per dan. Jiaxing is scheduled to open scales on the 20th, and Wuxi will open scales on June 1 or 2. Suzhou is scheduled to open scales on the 28th. All of the above areas have improved varieties, and it is difficult to determine the purchase price based on the silkworm farmers' ideals, because this year the selling price of mulberry leaves has been as high as 60,000 yuan per dan, resulting in very high production costs.

Also reported, after the 20 billion yuan loan for silk cocoons in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui began to be issued, the amount that has been issued so far is 2 billion yuan in the eastern Zhejiang area. According to a representative of the loan syndicate, the spring cocoon industry in eastern Zhejiang has already started, so the loans were issued in advance. The Jiangnan area will have to wait until the 27th or 28th of this month to start, so the loan period is relatively long. It is estimated that the 20 billion yuan loan can purchase about 240,000 dan of wet cocoons and 80,000 dan of dry cocoons.

### China Farmers Bank Loans 500 Million Yuan to Purchase Hangzhou Tea; Foreign Firms Scouring for Green Tea for Export

According to a responsible person from the Tea Merchant Trade Association, in order to jointly purchase Hangzhou tea, a discussion meeting was held a few days ago. In addition to discussing purchasing strategies, Wu Chang, Dadechang, Zhenzhong, Zhenxing, Great China, and Tongtaixiang, and seven other companies were designated as representatives to consult with the authorities on loans. Approval has now been obtained, and the China Farmers Bank will lend 500 million yuan. Li Naichang and Huang Yantang have also been appointed as joint purchasing directors, and it is expected that personnel will be sent to Hangzhou within days to engage in purchasing.

Europe and Africa currently have a very strong demand for Chinese tea, but due to various reasons, sales have not been smooth. It is learned that starting in June, foreign authorities may issue special import permits for Chinese tea. Therefore, foreign tea exporters in the Japanese market have been taking action to prepare for this eventuality. Recently, Jardine Matheson and Wu Chang and Yilong companies have purchased no less than 2,000 boxes of export green tea such as Needle Eyebrow and Special Contribution. The market atmosphere is also more active and colorful than last week. The former was traded at 35,000 to 36,000 yuan per dan, while the latter was at 36,000 to 37,000 yuan, and the market prices have risen by more than 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. As for domestic sales, merchants from Tianjin and Nanjing are continuing to be very active in the producing areas for Hangzhou new Banner Spear tea. The new Wenquan Longjing tea has arrived in large quantities, but its quality is inferior, and the market continues to trend downwards. The supply and demand for old tea varieties are equal, and the situation is difficult to change.

### American Fruit Arrives in Large Quantities

[Reported by this newspaper] Famous American fruits such as Golden Mountain apples, oranges, and lemons have been abundant in the market lately, and the supply continues to be uninterrupted. The President Cleveland, managed by the American President Lines, arrived in Shanghai yesterday from San Francisco, carrying a large shipment of fruits, with more than 40,000 pieces. The ship also carried more than 10,000 bags of cement and more than 3,000 tons of goods.

### Silk is Weak

Yesterday, the silk market was weak again, but factory agents held onto the original price. Lian Na Company's purchase price for 83-count high uniformity yarn was 2.6 million yuan per dan. The price of user silk warp crepe was 1.7 million to 1.75 million yuan. 120-count Tianqiao bright rayon opened at 1.36 million yuan, and the closing price was 1.37 million yuan, with trading at 1.38 million yuan in the afternoon. The fluctuation throughout the day was minimal, and the result was 20,000 yuan shorter than the previous day. The price of 75-count Golden Rooster semi-dull silk fell because good prices have been seen in the market for several days, and yesterday, there was a sudden oversupply, with the price falling 60,000 yuan compared to the previous day. American Asia bedspreads were down a small amount, approximately 20,000 yuan per hundred, and Da Cheng's crepe was down a small amount, approximately 130 yuan per yard.

### American Industrial Recovery Makes Good Initial Progress

[Dispatch from the U.S. Information Service, Washington, 13th] According to statistics from the U.S. Department of Commerce, although American industry has successfully passed the first phase of recovery, this gain is in danger of being erased by price inflation and speculation. The post-war decline in production, manufacturing, and employment has now been completely reversed. However, the government must maintain prices to preserve a sound price structure. If the government fails to do so, a severe depression will follow a period of prosperity. Although American industry faces many difficulties (such as labor disputes), the production of civilian goods has increased.

### 500,000 Tons of Rice From Java to be Sent to India

Reuters, Batavia, 14th: Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir previously wrote to India's Nehru offering to send 500,000 tons of Java rice to India. Nehru has replied accepting the offer. Sjahrir reiterated yesterday that he would not go back on his word and asked India to send responsible representatives to Java as soon as possible to discuss barter trade issues. If India cannot supply textiles, agricultural tools, or other items needed by Java, an exchange with foreign exchange or other items would also be acceptable.

### British Rayon Production Increases

British Information Services, London, 14th: Rayon production in the United Kingdom in March of this year reached 15.6 million pounds, the highest monthly production since July 1940, exceeding the 1939 average by 3 percent. On a daily production basis, March production was 5 percent higher than February and 19 percent higher than March 1945. The production of woolen yarn has reached a new level, totaling 6.4 million pounds.

### Rice Market Prank; Briefly Rested the Day Before Yesterday, but Moved Forward Vigorously Again Yesterday

Yesterday, the rice market still had supply, but sales were active and digestion was flexible. The rice market suddenly surged, with the opening price for top-grade white glutinous rice immediately calling for 48,000 yuan to 49,000 yuan. Buyers flocked in and transactions were brisk, and continued to rise, soon breaking through the 50,000 yuan mark. Although the Bean and Rice Trade Association dumped goods arriving at the warehouse on the market, it was of no avail. The closing price for white glutinous rice was as high as 51,500 yuan, and top-grade thin indica rice rose to 52,000 yuan, with the average market price rising by approximately 3,500 yuan compared to the previous day. Flour was also affected by the rising rice prices, and sentiment trended higher, rising by 400 to 500 yuan. Supply and demand for soybeans were not strong, but sellers were very firm and also raised prices by 500 to 600 yuan. Soybean cakes were strong in the morning and weak in the afternoon, rising slightly by 100 yuan. Bran sales were sluggish, peanut kernels remained mediocre, and corn from Qingdao was not actively purchased, and the market was stable. Incoming and outgoing shipments in Shantou were balanced, raw soybean oil temporarily lacked growth or decline, but refined rapeseed oil was scarce and showed strength, with prices rising by more than 1,000 yuan. According to the rice market, the total amount of rice arriving in the city yesterday was more than 4,000 dan, and the types and quantities are as follows: White glutinous rice 1,875 shi, thin indica rice 699 shi, early indica rice 845 shi, Yangxian 130 shi, Duxian 530 shi, Wuyu 179 shi, Baiyuan 30 shi, Yinyuan 10 shi

Also reported, the rice supply in this city is very sufficient. Not counting private individuals and various factories, rice merchants have 800,000 shi of rice in storage, according to reports and investigations by the Rice Trade Association and relevant parties, and thick glutinous rice and thin indica rice from Changshu, Suzhou, Kunshan, and Songjiang areas are constantly arriving, which is sufficient to supply demand. The reason for the rice price fluctuations this time is entirely due to the "kicking rice ball" or buying and selling among rice merchants.

### China Silk and China Textile Establish Contact; Silkworm Farmers Use Sales Proceeds to Purchase China Textile Cloth as Much as Possible

In order to comply with President Song's instructions that the funds from this spring silkworm loan be used to guide silkworm farmers' funds back to the right track and eliminate undesirable spending, China Silk Company has established contact with China Textile Company to encourage silkworm farmers to use their sales proceeds to purchase China Textile cloth as much as possible. After several discussions between the two parties, a general agreement has been reached, and the details are as follows: (1) China Textile will first deliver an equal amount of cloth to the cocoon purchasing offices of China Silk in Hangzhou, Huzhou, Jiaxing, Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou, and these six offices will be responsible for receiving, storing, and selling the cloth. (2) China Textile will send sales supervisors to the above six offices to preside over pricing matters. (3) Prices will be generally reduced by 10 to 20 percent according to local conditions. (4) Silkworm farmers will purchase cloth with their silkworm sales certificates, based on the quantity of cocoons sold. (5) All proceeds from the sale of cloth will be handed over to the bank designated by China Textile.

### The United States Must Import Raw Materials to Maintain Production Efficiency

[Dispatch from the U.S. Information Service, Washington, 13th] According to Paul, director of the U.S. International Trade Bureau, the United States must import a large amount of goods to supplement its own production and maintain manufacturing efficiency. The United States must rely on foreign imports for many important materials. For example, for automobiles, although steel and glass are produced in the United States, the mohair used by Detroit automakers comes from Algeria, leather from Argentina, goat wool from Asia Minor, tin and rubber from Borneo or Manila, shellac sheets from India, and tin ore from China. Statistics show that 300 types of raw materials from 75 different countries are needed to manufacture a car. Paul said that U.S. imports are the main way for countries to obtain U.S. dollars to purchase U.S. goods, and in fact, each country produces a part of the goods that the United States needs. Paul said that in order for the international trade organization to work smoothly, countries must find ways to reduce and eventually remove trade barriers, including excessive tax rates and economic barriers, which can become political and social barriers and result in unnecessary animosity between countries.

### North China Export Goods, Pig Bristles are More Promising

[Reuters, Tianjin, 14th] The U.S. government-sponsored "Foreign Commerce Weekly" discusses the current state of trade in North China, stating that since the Japanese surrender, virtually no wool has arrived in Tianjin because railway traffic to Tianjin and Shandong, Inner Mongolia, and western China has continued to be cut off. It is expected that the small amount of wool that may arrive in 1946 will only be enough to supply local needs, and no wool will be available for export for a considerable period of time. In 1936, Tianjin exported 25 million pounds of wool to the United States. In addition, no surplus cotton will be available for export in the next six or nine months. The 1945-46 cotton harvest is estimated to be about 500,000 dan, only a quarter of what local spinning mills need. The pig bristle industry was the least affected by Japanese interference, and the exportable quantity is estimated at 10,000 to 15,000 boxes. Tianjin's leather goods production is large, but goat skin inventory is low and there is no hope of exporting it. Tianjin's [illegible] carpet industry faces many difficulties due to scattered workers, lack of raw materials, and damaged machinery. The report concludes that Tianjin's purchasing power for foreign goods has been reduced due to its weak export capacity, and the hope of recovering imports is also very dim.

### The Enigmatic Rice Relief Problem: Guangzhou Rice Prices Breach the 100,000 Mark

— Guangzhou Airmail from our Newspaper on the 11th, Special Correspondent Liang Feng

No one can deny that war brings poverty, disease, and hunger, and the demon of hunger is truly more cruel than anything else. Now, the giant hand of this demon of hunger is gripping the entire city of Guangzhou, threatening millions of citizens with starvation.

Bamboo Shoots and Flowers Used as Food

The food shortage in Guangzhou did not begin today, but the current high rice prices probably exceed those in the entire country. From the 20th of last month to the 2nd of this month, the price soared from over 40,000 yuan per dan (unit of weight) to over 100,000 yuan. As a result, people are in a state of panic, society is uneasy, and a terrifying scene has been created. Not only can the working masses not make a living, but even middle and upper-class families find it difficult to maintain their standard of living. Although they have not yet reached the point of eating grass roots and bark, many people have already taken to eating bamboo shoots and flowers to satisfy their hunger. Fifty to sixty people die of starvation on the streets every day. Those who are stronger struggle for survival, often robbing passersby of the food they carry. The owners of rice shops and food shops are constantly guarding against a group of "hungry thugs." Newspapers have also published a shocking piece of news: "At the beginning of this month, the Communists sent people with heavy funds to buy large quantities of grain in the four rural districts and the Shaqi Rice Market, secretly transporting it to various places for hoarding in order to stimulate grain prices. The conspiracy is to wait until the rice price rises to less than two liang (unit of weight) for every hundred yuan, and then mobilize the city's vagrants and beggars, organizing rice and food grabbing gangs in an attempt to create terror and disrupt social order..." Therefore, on "May Fourth" Day, when students commemorated the "May Fourth Movement" with a parade, when the procession passed Huiai Road, the rice shop owners, who were on edge, closed their doors uniformly. Only after they learned that it was a student parade did they return to normal. This also shows the severity of the panic here.

Monday, Change to Eating Coarse Grains

Regarding the food shortage problem, the authorities can be said to have paid considerable attention long ago. They also launched an anti-drought and disaster relief campaign and promoted a food conservation campaign, requiring all sectors of the city to eat coarse grains every Monday. However, all of these passive measures failed to curb the rise in rice prices. Therefore, the provincial government's industrial company, together with the provincial and municipal chambers of commerce and the grain guild, organized the so-called "Joint Grain Business," planning to purchase rice from neighboring provinces and various counties in this province to bring back to the city to provide relief. On April 25, they began to implement grain control, establishing a grain market, requiring all grain merchants in the city to concentrate their transactions in this market, with personnel from the Land and Food Office and the Social Bureau guiding them to prevent unscrupulous merchants from manipulating the market and stabilize the grain situation. The intention was originally the best, but after the "joint business" and "grain market" were opened, not only did the rice price not fall, but it actually soared, reaching a new record of a jump of 30,000 to 40,000 yuan per zu (a unit of weight) in three days. As a result, the problem became more and more serious. If this continues, it is really unknown what the outcome will be, and social order will be impossible to maintain.

Three-Level Jump, Unable to Restrain

The party, government, and military authorities all felt a headache for this problem. They convened emergency meetings of relevant agencies every day to discuss ways to regulate food and stabilize rice prices. Chairman Luo and the provincial party headquarters telegraphed the central government for relief one after another. The military headquarters tried its best to reduce military grain (since the repatriation of Japanese prisoners, Japanese residents, and Korean residents and the transfer of a portion of the National Army, the amount has been reduced from 130,000 large packages to 65,000 large packages). They also ordered that troops be strictly prohibited from purchasing military grain directly to avoid stimulating grain prices. The provincial government also posted notices and published in newspapers, quoting the national government's "Provisional Regulations on Punishing Violations of Food Administration in Times of Emergency," stating that those who hoard food, engage in speculation, manipulate the market, drive up grain prices, disrupt the market, and harm people's livelihoods will be severely punished... The National Assembly representatives in Guangdong are also holding meetings every day to discuss disaster relief and have appointed Lin Yizhong, Lu Yougang, Wu Zhimei, and Hu Muzha, among other four representatives, and Xiao Ciyi, director of the Land and Food Office, to go to Beijing to appeal for help. The Guangzhou News Reporters Association also holds meetings every day to discuss how to help the government solve the food shortage problem. However, one meeting today and another meeting tomorrow, they are meeting every day, but still unable to restrain the "three-level jump" of rice prices!

Siam Rice, Relieving the Poor

In late April, there was good news that 4,000 tons of Siam rice donated by overseas Chinese in Siam to relieve the food shortage in this province had arrived in Guangzhou. Of these 4,000 tons of Siam rice, 2,000 tons were shipped to Shantou, 500 tons were shipped to Hainan Island, and 1,500 tons were distributed in Guangzhou to relieve the extremely poor citizens. For this batch of rice, a relief distribution committee was organized, preparing 100,000 rice tickets to be issued to extremely poor and unemployed poor citizens. Starting from May 1, each person could receive 18 catties (unit of weight) of Siam rice with a ticket. When this news came, the poor citizens naturally cheered. In principle, with this 1,500 tons of rice adjusting the market, the rice price should fall, but the opposite happened. Not only did the arrival of this batch of Siam rice have no impact on suppressing the rice price, but the day the distribution began was the time when the rice price soared. On May 2, it broke through the 100,000 mark. Isn't this strange?

Coarse Broken Rice, Suspicious

Originally, in late April, newspapers were reporting the news of Siam rice aiding Guangdong every day, but the rice price was rising every day, which was already a bit baffling. Later, another piece of news spread (before the matter is verified, it can be said to be a rumor) that someone sold this batch of Siam rice in Hong Kong, and now they need to purchase 1,500 tons of local rice in this city for distribution, so the rice price soared because of their purchase. At the same time, there are now six or seven types of rice being distributed, some good and some bad. The bad ones are not just coarse rice and broken rice, but also contain a lot of rice bran. It is said that this kind of rice simply cannot be cooked into rice. From this point of view, it seems that everyone believes that the news of selling the Siam rice and purchasing various types of rice locally to fill the gap is a fact. Is the rice being distributed Siam rice after all? Everyone is suspicious.

Guangdong Branch Office, Target of Public Criticism

As a result, almost the entire food shortage problem has been focused on the Siam rice problem. The joint party, government, and military meeting even organized an investigation team to thoroughly investigate the situation of the relief rice being resold in Hong Kong. This batch of rice was issued by the Guangdong Branch Office of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. The Guangdong Branch Office has been criticized by the public in the past for its ineffective relief efforts, and this time they are responsible again, so the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Branch Office has become the "target of public criticism."

On May 8, the reception for all sectors of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Review Committee was held in the conference hall of the military headquarters, chaired by General Zhang Fakui, the director of the military headquarters, because he is the chairman of the Review Committee. However, he first stated that although he is the chairman of the Review Committee, the actual relief work is handled by the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Branch Office. So the main character of the day was still Mr. Ling Daoyang, the director of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Branch Office. After he reported on the work of the Branch Office for a while, everyone's questions were fired off like guns. Everyone was shouting: "Where did the Siam rice go?" "Is the rice being distributed now Siam rice after all?" National Assembly representative Li Dexuan even brought five small bags of five different types of rice being distributed to everyone for research. However, Director Ling's reply was: In addition to the Guangdong Branch Office, there are four other agencies directly under the "General Administration" responsible for relief in Guangdong, namely the Kowloon Storage and Transportation Bureau, the Guangzhou Storage and Transportation Office, the Purchasing and Sales Office, and the Highway Transportation Office. This time, the Siam rice was completely handed over to the Guangzhou Storage and Transportation Office directly by the Kowloon Storage and Transportation Bureau. Because they do not belong to the same system of jurisdiction, he has no way to intervene. This is obviously completely pushing off the responsibility.

Director Ma, Heavily Questioned

As a result, everyone's attention turned to the Guangzhou Storage and Transportation Office. However, that day, the director of the office, Ma, intentionally hid himself. Luo Yiqun, a member of the Central Committee, proposed: "Call Director Ma to come immediately!" Senators Zhang Liangxiu and Guan Yi even whispered "detain him," and the atmosphere became more and more tense. Finally, Director Ma arrived after being summoned, and everyone raised serious questions again. Director Ma firmly denied that there was any resale of Siam rice in Hong Kong. By that time, it was already late, but a definite answer was still not obtained. This answer probably depends on the report of the joint investigation team of the party, government, and military meeting. I believe that one day the truth will come out.

Regarding the matter of corruption in Siam rice, it is of course not without reason. But if, after a thorough investigation in the future, it is determined that there is no corruption in Siam rice, then why is the rice price soaring like this? There must be other reasons at play!

Timely Rain, Grain Prices Slightly Recover

When the truth about the Siam rice corruption is not clear, we will not talk about it for the time being, but regarding the formation of the soaring rice price in this city, the reporter has investigated from all sides. According to those familiar with the rice market, there are also the following factors: (1) This province's counties suffered severe drought in the spring, and the amount of stored grain is decreasing day by day. Demand exceeds supply, and grain merchants and wealthy households compete to purchase, which stimulates grain prices. (2) Not only is this province lacking grain, but other provinces also feel the lack of grain, and there is no way to provide relief. (3) The government has no grain in hand and only talks about control. The implementation is not done properly. For example, the prices in the grain market are either too high compared to the market situation, or the public prices are too low, causing less and less rice from various rivers and valleys to come to the province. (4) Although military grain has been reduced, all of it is purchased on the market. Taking military food into consideration, there is no way to stabilize civilian grain. (5) There are more than a hundred grain shops in this city that specialize in grain, and they all live within their means, maintaining their original inventory and not releasing it to regulate the market, which is no different from hoarding. (6) A large portion of the funds of grain merchants are involved in speculation, which has created a huge wave, affecting the psychology of the masses. Those who have grain are holding on to it, and those who don't have grain are competing to buy it, which makes the market's grain situation even more panic and chaotic. In addition to these six reasons, some people also say that many bureaucratic capitalists are involved in manipulating grain prices this time. Of course, we hope that this is just a guess, or a rumor.

Although, in the past two days, timely rain has suddenly fallen, the drought is expected to be eliminated, and grain prices have also begun to fall, now hovering between 60,000 and 70,000 yuan. However, the shadow of grain price fluctuations seems to still exist, and we can only hope that the wise authorities will handle it properly.

### Political Changes in Hunan Province: The New and Old Chairmen Have Different Styles; Wang Dongyuan Came to Rescue from Disaster

— Changsha Airmail from our Newspaper on the 5th, Special Correspondent Gao Yuanli

The reorganization of the Hunan Provincial Government, which had been in the works for nearly two months, was not officially announced by the Executive Yuan until the middle of last month. Wang Dongyuan, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, was transferred to Hunan. Soon after, the directors and members of various departments were also changed one after another. Only Wang Fengjie, the director of the Education Department, remained in office. The new provincial government lineup is neat and tidy, and the people of Hunan are refreshed. Undoubtedly, it has received good reviews from all parties, considering it the soundest provincial government in the restoration period.

Former Chairman Wu Qiwai was appointed in a time of crisis, establishing the provincial government in Yuanling, the wartime capital of the province. Everyone knew that this stage was extremely difficult. The original provincial government was far away in Lanshan and Jiahe, and there was no way to take over. Even the seals of the provincial government and various departments were not available. It was extremely inconvenient for Chairman Wu to issue orders in Yuanling, and the organization was not sound. Everything can be said to be makeshift. However, facing the military operations to cooperate with the counter-offensive, the responsibility was extremely heavy. Fortunately, it did not last long. The enemy surrendered, and the Yuanling Provincial Government and the Provincial Government in southern Hunan moved back to Changsha to merge, and the organization was finally completed. However, the work of restoration followed closely, and there were thousands of threads that needed to be handled with extreme caution. Mr. Wu is known as a nice guy. Although his style of doing things is not very proactive, it is not considered very passive either. The people of Hunan are self-reliant in this neither proactive nor passive state. To put it calmly, everyone is doing well. However, the frequent disasters and the soaring grain prices forced the provincial government to reorganize in order to cope with this extraordinary situation. The initial rumor was that there would be a partial reorganization, and Secretary-General Liu Xuhui would be promoted to a higher position. However, not long after the official announcement of Mr. Liu's appointment as a member of the provincial government, there was a rumor of a full-scale reorganization, but it was always just a rumor. When Chairman Wu returned to Changsha after attending the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee, the news of the reorganization subsided for a while, but it was officially revealed soon after.

(1) An Episode

Just after the government officially announced the reorganization, before the new officials arrived, a bizarre incident occurred in Changsha, namely a sudden increase in rice prices. In a period of five days, the price of rice soared from 28,000 yuan per shi (unit of weight) to 53,000 yuan. At that time, most of the newspapers in Changsha almost unanimously said that so-called "special power figures" were searching for 50,000 shi of grain in Changsha to transport south. At that time, the rice price in Hengyang, Qiyang, and Lingling was 70,000 yuan, and the rice price in Guangdong was 60,000 yuan per 100 catties (unit of weight). Each shi of Hunan rice sent to Guangdong could make a net profit of 50 catties of rice. This number is quite large. The editorials, features, news, and even supplements of the newspapers all took this as the subject, criticizing and describing it, and saying that the brother of a certain important person was responsible for the search, but they never clearly stated who the so-called "special power figures" were. The official response was only that Chairman Wu ordered the relevant agencies to investigate and severely punish the so-called manipulators, but the agencies, as usual, forwarded the order without any response. This matter continued until the day the new chairman took office, and then it disappeared without a trace. This is an episode during the transition between the old and new.

(2) Hunan Obtains the Right Person

The people of Hunan are most familiar with the new chairman, Wang Dongyuan. Wang is from Anhui, but almost all of his career has been built in Hunan, from being a battalion commander to a division commander, all in Hunan. Moreover, his wife is also from Hunan. When the order for him to govern Hunan was sent to Changsha, everyone said that it was better to have half a Hunan person govern Hunan. He originally belonged to the Fourth Route Army Headquarters, so his former comrades and old subordinates were celebrating and reliving the old dreams of the past. But times are progressing, and politics is especially progressing. And Mr. Wang Dongyuan has made great progress in the past few years as the director of the wartime training center.

Mr. Wang arrived on April 26 and took office on April 27. As soon as he got off the bus, he said that he "came to rescue from disaster." He told the news media that the disaster in Hunan was more severe than any other province. Linxiang and Yueyang were places where he used to be stationed. He said that when he passed through Linxiang and Yueyang this time, he simply couldn't recognize them. They were completely destroyed. Coming to Hunan feels like coming home. This home really needs to be rebuilt. When he talked about disaster relief, he advocated "launching large-scale work relief," but he did not give specific measures. He said that he would contact the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to strive for supplies to overcome the difficulties. He also said that various relief efforts were too late due to various reasons, so he advocated a policy of "self-help and mutual help." This policy was implemented in Henan in the past and was effective, that is, the county, township, pao (administrative division), and chia (smallest unit of administrative division) levels are responsible. Which chia has victims, that chia is responsible for relief. Which pao has a disaster, that pao is responsible for relief. The township is responsible for the township, and the county is responsible for the county. This can be done quickly and accurately, and it is better than government relief.

(3) Key Politics

When reading the policy guidelines, Mr. Wang emphasized "key politics." He said that he did not have the extravagant hope of "everything being revived," but only wanted to accomplish one thing at a time, accumulating bit by bit to achieve practical results. This announcement received the sympathy of many people, but how to actually do it could only wait for the next steps.

The long-awaited rain also came with Chairman Wang's special car. As soon as Chairman Wang got off the train, it started to rain. In Hunan society, where feudal ideas have not been completely eradicated, it did arouse great excitement among the people. However, the heavy rain has continued for days, the river has risen sharply, mountain torrents have broken out, and highways and railways have been blocked. The streets along the river in Changsha are also flooding. It would be bad if it turns into a flood. The food shortage is already tight, and a flood would make Hunan even worse. After the heavy rain, grain prices have eased slightly, and people can breathe a little.

Chairman Wang announced that he came to rescue from disaster, so he scheduled to go to the disaster areas in southern Hunan with Liu Xuru, the director of the Social Affairs Department, and Yao Xuehuai, the deputy director of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, in two days to inspect the disaster. However, due to the blockage of highways and railways by the water, it has not been possible to go. It is feared that Mr. Hoover's trip to Hunan to inspect the disaster will also be suspended due to the weather.

(4) A Mistake of One Word

Finally, I would like to report a small episode in the reorganization of the Hunan Provincial Government: In this reorganization of the provincial government, Li Yuyiao, the original member of the provincial government and director of the Construction Department, was dismissed. The vacancy was filled by Li Yujiu, the former mayor of Changsha. It is unknown for what reason, but the newspapers in Changsha, Hankou, and Shanghai all mistook the word "jiu" (九, nine) for "yao" (堯, Yao). As a result, letters and telegrams were sent from all over to Li Yuxiao congratulating him on his re-election. It was not until Chairman Wang came to Changsha and forwarded the government order that the matter was clarified, almost causing a joke. In fact, Li Yujiu and Li Yuyiao are different people, not brothers.

### Drooping Heads, Ash-Colored Faces: Traitorous Jin Villains Paraded Through the Streets

— Taiyuan Correspondence on the 6th, from Zhongji

The Military Intelligence Bureau arrested 55 Chinese traitors in the Shanxi area, including the pseudo-provincial governor Su Tiren. Except for Su Tiren and a certain Mr. Jiang (grandson of Jiang Shuhai), the former pseudo-Yanmen Dao (administrative division) governor, the investigations of the rest have been completed and they were handed over to the court yesterday.

At 8:45, escort officers Sun Yixian and Hu Jinbo, accompanied by many police and military officers, went to the temporary detention center in Nanxiaochang to collect them. Among them, Chen Qinshan, Zhang Erji, Lu Yuting, Guo Yi, Zhou Bing, Fan Rongying, Liu Xiang, Chang Jinnjiu, and Mai Zhenhai were released later for various reasons. The remaining 47 people, including the rebellious Feng Sizhi, after being handcuffed and called by name, were divided into five heavy-duty vehicles, each marked with the names of the traitors, and escorted out simultaneously under strict guard. In order to show the public the giant traitors, the vehicles went slowly around the bustling streets of Bingyuan, passing through Hongshi Street, Qiaotou Street, Zhonglou Street, Ansi Street, and Maoer Lane. The masses, hearing the news, all wanted to see the true faces of the giant traitors who had served as tigers for the enemy in the past. Therefore, there were crowds of people everywhere. Those who were indignant could not help but shout for the elimination of traitors, and the crowd echoed, their voices shaking the sky. Many people also applauded along with them. The traitors all showed embarrassment, drooping their heads, and some had ash-colored faces. When they arrived at the High Court, there were no less than several thousand spectators on the way, blocking the road. Chief Prosecutor Hao Yuzong and others called their names and accepted the case. At 9:40, the interrogation began, four people per batch. The interrogation was completed at 10:00, and they were escorted back to the vehicles and sent to the Provincial First Prison, where Warden Meng Yucai called their names, verified their fingerprints, and divided them into cells. Each traitor occupied a single room, waiting for the formal trial to begin.

The Evil Deeds of Three Traitors

Among the 47 traitors, Feng Sizhi and Wang Xiang were the most important.

(1) The Rebellious Feng, from Pingding, Shanxi, had talent in his youth, was good at flattery, and was very muddled-headed in matters. Before the incident, he had served as the chairman of the Shanxi Provincial Education Association and the director of the Education Department. After the incident, the rebellious Feng also retreated with the army to Wanquan County in southern Shanxi. After living there for more than a year, he returned to Bing and surrendered to the enemy.

(2) The Rebellious Wang Xiang, from Shouyang County, Shanxi, had a good reputation for running the Provincial First Middle School for many years, producing many talents. Later, he ran the Yangquan Coal Mine, and his performance was quite good. In the 20th year of the Republic of China, he was selected and recommended by the Meng-Jin authorities as the director of the Construction Department, and he enjoyed a great reputation for a time. Later, he was transferred to the manager of the Shanxi Provincial Bank. After Taiyuan fell to the enemy, he moved to Xi'an several times. In the 28th year, the rebel returned to Qiulin Town, Yichuan County, Shaanxi, to temporarily serve in the Second War Zone Headquarters. After leaving, he turned to Hong Kong to take care of his family's affairs during the war. After Hong Kong fell, he returned to Bing and joined the enemy.

(3) Ma Libo had been mixing in the news media for many years. He was straightforward, quite literate, and used Yema as his pen name. On the eve of the fall of Taiyuan, the reporter met him in Liuxiang, encouraging each other to resist the enemy. He still boasted, "I am old but my ambition does not wane. Watch what the old horse is going to do." He had organized a militia to resist the enemy in Jishan. How long had it been before he entered the city and joined the enemy? Today, he finally became a prisoner, ridiculed by everyone!

### A Ladleful from the Huan River

— A Zhuji Dispatch, the 5th, from Fei Village

When I first arrived in this mountain city, Zhuji's appearance was extremely tattered and unsightly. During the war, it fell three times, each time the enemy invaded, bombed, burned, killed, and destroyed. Each time the enemy retreated under the force of our people's armed strength, it was again bombing, burning, killing, and destruction. Victory came, and just after taking over, looking only at the buildings in the urban area, out of a hundred houses, no more than three or four remained, and even the few that remained were not intact. In the countryside, the situation was also very desolate. It is said that entire villages were burned to the ground, a desolate white expanse. These scars left by the aftermath of the catastrophe starkly displayed the legacy of the enemy's invasion of Zhuji. Living in this desolate and ruined mountain city, I felt that the shadow of war was still following us closely.

The people of Zhuji are known for their "strong and unyielding character." Naturally, in the past, they had dedicated countless flesh and blood, tears and sweat to the resistance against Japan. The stories of those who worked hard and sacrificed for the liberation of their homeland are still talked about with relish among the people. Here, I do not want to introduce them, but only to make an objective sketch of Zhuji today.

The Dust and Wind of Yue Women

After spring arrived, the people here seemed to have gained a bit of vitality. Due to the devastation of housing, construction was underway everywhere in the cities and villages, building new houses. However, the houses that were being built mostly maintained a "wartime" style, and the quality of materials and construction was incomparable to the meticulous standards of pre-war times. Ruins have begun to be cleared, and new houses are increasing day by day. In just over two months, the mountain city has surprisingly changed its appearance. Shops have increased, and the roads have been widened. Now, in the small town, one can even hear the sound of phonographs. A department store recently had a "sale" and hired a band to play music, adding a bit of bustle. However, the mountain city is still too desolate, and those sounds and decorations always make people feel lonely!

The busiest place is not in the central urban area, but in the area around the North Gate. It is close to the train station, and most of the cars also stop there. As a result, so-called merchants gather and travelers flock there, creating the prosperity of the North Gate area today. It seems that there are no "public prostitutes" here, but private prostitutes have become active. They are slowly equipping and adding everything that meets the needs of those travelers and merchants.

According to some people's estimates, the prosperity of the Zhuji urban area will have a period of strong growth in the future, because the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has not yet been fully connected. But I think: The future status of Zhuji on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, due to its proximity to the provincial capital (Hangzhou), will probably not be inferior to that of Jinhua and Lanxi, right?

A Ghastly Picture

Along with the spring light, the dark shadow of famine has covered this land after the catastrophe. When spring training began, it rained for thirty or forty days straight, and some crops were severely damaged. Then came the epidemic, and barley and wheat were followed by an epidemic disease. It is feared that there will not be a good harvest this spring. This year is the first year after the war, and the people regard food as their heaven. Food supply threatens people first. Recently, the price of rice has jumped past the 30,000 mark, catching up with the areas around Shanghai and Hangzhou.

Most of the people are so poor that they are about to lose even the right to smell the aroma of rice. Although relief flour has been distributed once, what use is five catties? To save a dying life, just thinking of "tomorrow" makes one tremble all over! Moreover, the allocated "funds" and "rice" are still being strictly enforced!

In the food shortage, elementary school teachers are the first to face the crisis. Several "central national schools" and "bao national schools" in the villages are already without rice to cook. Teachers cannot tighten their belts and teach while hungry! As a result, some have become lazy in teaching, and some have simply closed their doors. Recently, students from the Yuan Dong Township school held a petition march. Their little slogan was: "We want to study! We cannot let our teachers go hungry!"

Just like other places, it seems that a ghastly picture that one cannot bear to look at will unfold here!

### Tokyo Has Become Smaller: Population Reduced to Only 3.5 Million, Anything Can Be Bought as Long as You Have Money

— Specially Translated by This Newspaper's Translation Office

Today's Tokyo is undoubtedly the smallest city in the world. The journalists living in the Tokyo Press Club, the few surviving European and American expatriates who survived the war, and even the officers and soldiers in the occupation forces, do not have any direct concern for the daily life of this city of 3.5 million people. Only two or three thousand people go in and out of social events, and they will eventually get to know each other.

Of course, some people pay attention to the trends in Japanese politics and economics and conduct serious observation and analysis. Moreover, every foreigner has some contact with Japanese people who speak English or French, but the Japanese way of life and various problems have a clearly different, unrealistic color in the eyes of Westerners. The most important thing that has influenced Westerners is probably the freezing of bank deposits and the conversion of old yen into new yen. This is also something they are worried about.

The Marunouchi Hotel, located in the heart of Tokyo, is the social center for Europeans, Americans, and Japanese. This apartment was not taken over by the US military for use as barracks. It has become a dormitory for European embassy staff (past and present) and American officers and soldiers. In addition, Japanese Foreign Ministry personnel were also allowed to set up rooms on the second and third floors. Throughout the winter, from cocktail hour (there were actually no cocktails) until after midnight, the hotel's lounge was filled with guests and visitors, discussing various plans.

Diplomats still have the desire to maintain their diplomatic status even when their governments no longer exist. This is especially true for the Italians. They relied on their own luck and the inscrutable minds of the Japanese to be detained there after the surrender of the Italian Badoglio government in 1944. The French, who were waiting to return home, discriminated against the Italians. The Swedes and Swiss, who were responsible for managing the affairs of foreign nationals during the war, discriminated against the French and Italians. However, the Americans adopted their traditional non-political attitude and did not discriminate against anyone.

Japanese Foreign Ministry personnel continued to gather in the dormitory. They were divided into two factions based on language—one that spoke English and one that spoke French. To know which faction a Japanese person belonged to, you don't need to hear them speak to know. You can determine it just by observing. The Japanese who spoke English were rude, overly sincere, and made loud, long laughs to show how well they understood the meaning of the joke. The Japanese who spoke French often draped their jackets over their shoulders like shawls in operas and wore long hair.

These things are all past events because most of the foreign diplomats living in Japan have returned home. However, before they returned home, a few major social events occurred that are worth mentioning here: One was the marriage of Ms. Jia Luohua, the "daughter" of the former French Consul General in Japan, to Mr. Warner, a photographer in the US Army. The other was the banquet held by the former Italian Ambassador and Ms. Yintai Li for Major General Wei Luopei. While they were feasting, a black market raiding team led by US military police suddenly broke in, interrupting the joyous celebration. As a result, several US soldiers and two former Italian air force personnel were arrested and taken away.

In early March, thirty Soviet representatives participating in the war crimes trials arrived in Tokyo, adding a layer of red brilliance to the international colors of the Marunouchi Hotel. Although rumors had circulated in advance that bloodshed would occur in the hotel, all the Red Army personnel and the White Russians in the hotel got along safely and no accidents occurred.

Tokyo's black market is one of the main bonds between the Japanese and Westerners. Six months after Japan's surrender, a pack of American cigarettes remains the standard of value. Europeans who have no relationship with the occupation forces almost completely buy goods above the official price.

As a Frenchman who has lived in the Far East for twenty-seven years said: "Thank God, Japan has become a completely disintegrated country. As long as you can pay, you can buy anything." (Report by Kali Hugh, special correspondent of the United Press in Tokyo on the 12th.)

Spring and Autumn

### A Painting on the Bed

— Hu Shi Weak

For people living in Shanghai, it is extremely difficult to experience the lush greenery of mountains and rivers, especially for the majority of small office workers and those who bear the burden of living on salary income. Among this majority is also myself, and of course, there is no need to say that I want to travel to the mountains and rivers, caress the pines and seek the ravines. Even if I know that the grass and trees in the park have turned green, and I occasionally steal a moment from my busy schedule to stroll around, I am still broken by my inner thoughts. So, I can only climb onto my pigeon-cage-like bed, close my eyes, and let the green mountains, green waters, verdant cypresses, and ancient pines come to my imagination from the darkness and stuffiness.

But this cannot be satisfied. Human desires are originally like this, but it is better to draw a cake to satisfy hunger. So, I spent one evening rushing to complete a picture and paste it on the bed.

Because the only small window in the dormitory is behind the kitchen, directly opposite the kitchen window, we are very reluctant to open it. We would rather let the stifling summer fill the room, or the smell of coal, coal ash, and heat are more unbearable than the heat and stuffiness of closing the window. I have lived here for five years, and I am used to everything, but sometimes when I read articles describing the fields and mountains, I cannot help but remember my hometown and want to travel to the fields. However, this power is ultimately much lighter and smaller than the whip of life!

I used my memories to draw the scenery outside the window of my home in the countryside. In the old house surrounded by mountains in my hometown, I chose a building facing southeast with open windows as a study. Outside the window facing southeast was a clump of willows almost as tall as the window. Except for the white catkins that floated all over the desk in the summer, I still cherished it very much. Outside the willow tree was a stream, but it was a bit narrow. Except for the floodwaters after the heavy rain in late summer and early autumn, it was dry for six or seven tenths of the year. But I didn't care about these because further away from the stream was a full lake of clear water. Like before, I could see the ripples of the lake water and the early morning and evening activities of the people living by the lake. The lake area is very small, and the south side of the lake is a winding mountain range. The stream does not connect with the lake water. Only the impact of mountain water can flow into the stream. What I especially find lovely is the lush green beauty after the summer rain, and the water droplets accumulated on the willow leaves are illuminated by the sun and sparkle. The green and yellow fields are even more clear and beautiful after being washed. Because I always had this scenery deeply imprinted in my mind, I drew it on a white piece of paper. This is not to embellish the beauty of the bed—on this bed and in this small dormitory, dust is always present. The eight beds and the only place to leave a path to walk have already been messy beyond repair.

In the evening, when I put down my tired body after a day's work, I use it to relax my mind and body. If it is so hot that I can't breathe, I often look at it, as if I opened the window and saw the coolness after the midsummer rain, and a clear, fresh wind swept in through the window.

During this period, who among the salaried class is not living in a daze and confusion? Who wants to look further? Drawing a cake to satisfy hunger is enough to give us a little comfort.

Now, spring is quietly descending on the earth. Spring in Jiangnan is so charming and bright! I seem to see the mountain colors of my hometown changing from yellow and withered to banana green again. Today, on this spring rainy day, the budding branches are tender green again.

### Resurrection

— Deng Lin

Hope is like a flower, it will wither, but it will also be resurrected. Life is like a small grass, it may wither silently, but it will also grow vigorously.

Friend! When you see a beautiful sunset and feel sad, do you think about tomorrow? Tomorrow will appear before your eyes without stinting. Leave your tears that you can cherish! Life is never-ending.

That morning, I asked Hua—a young friend: "What do you feel? About this era!"

"I feel a little boring. The surroundings are too cold!"

"Why? Do you want to surround yourself with some troubles?"

"Ah! I can't say. I'm so empty that I can't grab anything, but it's like something is blocked!"

Young people love to sing this old tune when their souls have some loss.

So, on a blank piece of paper, I wrote him these words: "The plum blossom has stretched out its buds from the thick snow to welcome the New Year, although the surroundings are equally cold."

Tell my friends around me: When the spring breeze sweeps through the water country, everything will be resurrected, so don't be saddened by the disillusionment of your hopes. Remember: This is an unchanging sentence, life is never-ending.

May it be engraved in everyone's heart.

### The Greatest Comfort

— Zhong Yuan

Many vegetarian old ladies are constantly moving their prayer beads in their hands, and ceaselessly chanting "Amitabha Amitabha" in their mouths. It is said that they are accumulating wealth for themselves, but that wealth is not accumulated on earth, but in the Western Paradise. It is said that chanting the Buddha's name once deposits a sum of money in the Buddha's country, so everyone chants desperately, hoping that after death, they will ascend to the Western Paradise and enjoy a carefree life.

This is what the vegetarian old ladies think, and it certainly doesn't count. If the purpose of Buddhists chanting the Buddha's name is only to enjoy happiness after going to the Western Paradise, then Buddhism will become a selfish religion. However, in Christianity, there is indeed the teaching of "accumulating wealth in heaven," but the so-called "wealth" refers to "love," calling people to love friends, love neighbors, love all people in the world, and even love enemies—"love" is a property accumulated in the kingdom of heaven that will never decay!

Leaving religion aside, in this chaotic world, even from the secular point of view of interests, "accumulating wealth in heaven" is really not a losing thing. Today, you have plundered thousands of fortunes on earth, but you are worried day and night about thieves, robbers, extortion, and even the danger of being killed. What happiness is there to speak of? However, if you give your love to others, sometimes just a word of comfort, a smile, can be exchanged for people's eternal gratitude and eternal love!

What happiness in the world is greater than everyone loving you and everyone being grateful to you?

Men and women who are looking for happiness, put down the cumbersome gold and silver and accumulate wealth in heaven quickly!

### Remembering the Poet Yang Yunshi Bu

— Fang Zhou

Reading Mr. Tang Liyan's series of articles in this column remembering the poet Yang Biaoshi, I deeply feel the sorrow of the loss of a person. Remembering when I was young, I read Mr. Yang's poems and always admired him. Later, I drifted to Shanghai, and Mr. Yang also returned south after being forged. I met him by chance while I was a guest. Although I only met him once, I felt happy in my life and made a friendship of the same year. When the War of Resistance broke out, I heard that Mr. Yang had chosen to live in Hong Kong, and he chanted about his country with sorrow. The long song he made was thousands of words long, and he was generous and impassioned, truly not less than Du Fu's Northern Expedition poems. It was enough to encourage the weak and be a moral model, and not just a poetic history! His pure and noble character is truly worthy of his former master, General Wu.

Mr. Yang and the famous prostitute Chen Meimei's affairs have been recorded in detail by Mr. Ke, and many lost poems have also been quoted, so that romantic stories can spread widely in the world, but there are still some things that have not been exhausted. Mr. Yang was born with a passionate nature. When Ms. Xiake died, Mr. Yang cried sadly. The poems and essays mourning his death were compiled into a special collection, which General Fu Wei signed as: "Yang Qi's Eulogy to His Wife." At that time, he was a guest in Wuhan, and his friends invited him to drink wine and watch flowers to dispel his sorrows. He became close to Meimei. It was once widely rumored that they had discussed marriage. The good thing did not come to fruition, and both wanted to commit suicide for love. Newspapers carried the story, but it was unfounded. A friend wrote to comfort him, and he replied with a poem:

The tiger's head has no phase to talk about marquis, how can you get an allure like Mo Chou? Still a true scholar, drunk and sleeping with Yue women watching Wu Gou.

Meeting with wine in the slender waist palace, half of the country is in a hundred battles. Winning the heart of a beauty who is willing to die, a scholar is not necessarily different from a hero!

Pity myself painting swords and cherishing singing skirts, why meet in Wuxia clouds! I am also drifting with the pink and white, a strong year serving as an envoy and an old soldier. A friend wrote a letter saying that the Wuhan tabloid was competing to publish his traces. Those who should be involved should be added. Mr. Yang wrote a playful comment at the end of the paper, saying: "The newspaper has his freedom of publication, and prostitution is my freedom of love. If you want to blame his family's newspaper, first blame me for going to the Qin Building every night! As long as it's romantic and not obscene, why bother to pursue it!" It can be seen that his mind is frank and his measure is broad, and his personality is not comparable to those who cover up their faults, steal their names and deceive the world.

### Feelings on Returning to the Capital

— Xu Xing

The Han banner and the heavenly wind are competing to roll open, and the atmosphere is overflowing the clouds. The moving and peerless songs sing the praise of the head of state, and the historical sites of the past are entrusted to great scholars. There are still heads falling to the ground in shock. How can there be no tears to see the return to the capital? Please seek life and breathing from abdication and concession, and do not fail the difficult and bloody journey.

### On Tang Shixia's Painting

— Ya Daoren

Mr. Tang paints like writing poetry. One hill and one ravine are not easy. The overlapping clouds and mountains are beyond the misty clouds. The corners of the vermilion buildings are arranged appropriately. This place should not be found in the human realm. How can the human world be so beautiful? I know that many painters have illusions, but only the poet's artistic conception is strange. Rice in Chang'an is expensive and the world is bland. Can you live in the painting and poetry for a while? (According to Tang Jun, he has recently been invited by the Beijing Rong Baozhai to participate in a famous painting exhibition at the Chinese Painting Garden.)

### Night Theater

— Hong Ye

The night theater contains infinite life.

Many people are growing, acting, and dying. They walk towards the bright side; they also walk towards the dark side. They live towards the flying side; they also live towards the lingering side. Thus, one by one in joy and sorrow, in schadenfreude, they all show the true meaning of life.

How beautiful the night theater is!

A long string of years of laughter; endless days of suffering, we watch one old person die, the young grow old, and the children become adults. What remains unchanged is the dream woven by countless joys and sorrows formed by people.

Friend, do you need to know about life? Then go to the night theater to find it!

### Love in the Air-Raid Shelter

— Ren Jun

They met in the air-raid shelter—

When the early summer sun began to shine on the earth,

When the mountain city's fog was drawn open by the hot wind,

When large numbers of enemy planes frequently visited.

Enemy bullets made countless families and fathers and sons

Have to temporarily separate,

(How many people have been evacuated to the countryside!)

But it also made many people turn from strangers into acquaintances,

From acquaintances to confidants.

The two of them, soon—

Also turned from acquaintances to lovers.

Love is a bit close to selfishness,

Love can also make people become particularly great obstacles:

In the beginning,

They even hoped that a few more alarms could be issued;

Because this way—

They could meet a few more times,

Talk a few more times,

Sit closely together a few more times,

Share a few more hardships together!

Soon—

Like plum blossoms blooming in the wind and snow,

Their love, in suffering:

From bud to full bloom!

And, on a clear autumn day,

After an "evil bombing,"

They finally ran out of the air-raid shelter,

And held that simple and solemn wedding ceremony.

Perhaps the enemy had never even thought of it—

Their bombs of slaughter and destruction actually turned into

A matchmaker for lovers to finally become husband and wife!

### Double Flying (35)

— Zhao Qingge

"Brother, why don't you go to Beijing too! Mom said, there are so many, many books in Beijing for us to read." Lihua finally couldn't help but persuade Baoling this way. At the same time, she was indeed tempted by the yearning for these "books."

Baoling didn't say anything, just shook his head, and affectionately stroked Lihua's hair.

Lihua became even more puzzled. She thought in her heart, wasn't Baoling usually the most fond of reading? Why can't even books tempt him now?

Just like that, Lihua, in childish confusion, was brought into a new destiny of adversity by Mrs. Mo!

When everyone was about to part, Baoling said in a hoarse voice to Mrs. Mo:

"Mom! Don't worry and go! I have already found something to do! I will live with dignity!" After saying that, Baoling forced a bitter smile.

"Okay. However, I have already made arrangements for you. Mo Sheng will take care of you in the future."

Mrs. Mo cried! But, she finally hardened her heart and resolutely took Lihua and Liyun away!

Lihua, with red eyes, kept looking back at Baoling; looking at the house where she had grown up for eight years; looking at every plant and tree she was familiar with...

Only Liyun was calm; happy; because she was about to see her mother again. Moreover, she had no impression of the problems they were experiencing. She felt that changing to a new environment was good, and at the same time, in her innocent heart, as long as she was with Lihua, she would be satisfied.

After Baoling saw off Mrs. Mo and Lihua, and returned to this empty house, his heart was also empty! He walked into the study and sat on the grand master chair that Old Master Mo used to sit on. A burst of intense stabbing pain, like ten thousand sharp blades piercing into his chest, he helplessly lay on the desk and burst into loud cries!

"Dad!"

Mo Sheng witnessed this scene, which in his view, should have been the end of the Mo family's tragedy! He sighed, helped Baoling up, and comforted him:

"The old man didn't pamper you for nothing. With you staying in Jingzhou, he can smile in peace under the nine springs!"

Baoling, hearing these words, raised his head sadly, his tearful eyes blurring as he stared at Mo Sheng. As if discovering the soul of Old Master Mo, he dazedly lunged forward and fainted in Mo Sheng's arms!

### Answering Readers' Legal Questions

Zhang Lianrun of Hangzhou asks: I have heard that in the war-stricken areas, for the fields and properties traded among the people, after the victory, according to the laws that have been established, the seller can return the original price at the time to the buyer and forcibly take back the property rights. The questioner has many doubts. The so-called buying and selling is absolutely different in nature from mortgages. How can there be a reason to forcibly take back the sold fields and properties after a considerable period of time? Therefore, it is unavoidable that this will be misinterpreted by some opportunists. Generally speaking, formal and law-abiding citizens' mutual trading of fields and properties is definitely based on the willingness of both parties. I believe that the government authorities will never have such a legal provision. This is not comparable to the general shameless traitors who used the power of the enemy and puppets to forcibly occupy civilian properties in the occupied areas, taking other people's properties as their own. It goes without saying that the original owner filing a public lawsuit after the victory will not take effect. I respectfully request your newspaper to disclose this according to the principles of law, so that those who have doubts about this matter may know the correct details.

[Answer by Lawyer Cao Yaxia] Formal and law-abiding citizens who mutually trade fields and properties in the wartime occupied areas and have formally completed the buying and selling procedures, shall not be considered invalid. Only (A) the land title documents issued by the enemy and puppet organizations are invalid. The transfer of land rights should be re-registered by the right holders with the competent municipal and county governments within six months after the government publicly exercises its power after the restoration. (B) If the buying and selling act at the time was taking advantage of another person's urgency, recklessness, or lack of experience, causing them to make a property payment or a promise of payment, which, according to the circumstances at the time, was clearly unfair, the court may, upon the application of the interested party, revoke the legal act.

Qiu Zhuyu asks: I previously read the Municipal Government's Bulletin No. 6: the policy of giving a chance of renewal to the people involved in opium and drugs by the municipal authorities is truly admirable and makes the people grateful. However, the questioner still has some questions about the second article of the second item of the implementation principles of the plan, "Those who plant, manufacture, transport, and sell opium and drugs are allowed to sign a pledge of renewal before the end of February 1946, and those who fail to do so will be sent to the military law authorities for punishment according to law." That is, the article does not specify whether it is limited to the principals, or includes general practitioners related to opium and drugs. Are all of these personnel required to sign a pledge of renewal? If the law is in effect outside of the recovered area of Shanghai, and these people are now living in Shanghai, can they be handled in the same way by citing this law? I hope you can provide instructions and answers.

[Answer by Lawyer Cao Yaxia] Anyone who has planted, manufactured, transported, or sold opium and drugs is a co-conspirator under criminal law. Even if they are not the principal offender, they should be considered an accessory, and they should also sign a pledge of renewal. As for "personnel from outside the recovered area of Shanghai who are now living in Shanghai," they should be handled in accordance with the municipal laws and regulations.
