Chapter Four was thus completely reviewed. Following this, the remaining chapters were proceeded with. Chapter Five, "Agenda"; Chapter Six, "Readings"; Chapter Seven, "Discussion," were all passed smoothly. Only the word "special permission" in Article 42 was uniformly amended to "permission." It was already 12:00 PM, so Chairman Yu announced an extension of the meeting by 30 minutes. Chapter Eight, "Voting," caused considerable discussion and heated debate. After discussion and voting, the most contentious Article 51 was maintained in its original text with 743 votes, and the chairman retained the power to "adopt roll call or declare passage without objection" at his discretion. Article 49 was amended by an absolute majority to Wang Shijie's amendment, which changed it to "When there are two or more opinions on the results of the discussion of the same issue, the differences between each opinion and the original proposal should be compared, and the more different one should be put to a vote in sequence (originally 'the one proposed last should be put to a vote')." Article 52: 873 votes to amend it to "When the chairman deems it necessary and there is a request from at least fifty representatives (the original text did not have the phrase 'and there is a request...'), a reconsideration vote may be held."

Hong Lanyou reported: "As of 2:00 PM this afternoon, 1,615 representatives had registered, with 1,011 representatives present. The morning session was a review committee, and this afternoon is a general assembly." After the formalities, the amended opinions on the rules of procedure from the plenary review committee on the 25th and 26th were read out. It was resolved that Chairman Yu Youren would solicit any further opinions from the General Assembly before putting it to a vote. As a result, with 850 votes in favor, the "National Assembly Rules of Procedure" were declared effective. Subsequently, the reporter read out the "Draft General Rules for the Organization of Various Review Committees of the National Assembly," and Secretary-General Hong explained two points: First, this draft is named General Rules and compiles the organizational regulations of various review committees to avoid individually drafting organizational laws; Second, the technical issues included in the third proposal have not been included. The secretariat has already prepared letters to each representative, allowing each representative to freely designate a group and reply to the secretariat. After compiling and preparing a list, it will be submitted to the presidium for presentation to the General Assembly. Then, Chairman Yu announced the start of discussions. Representatives actively submitted written and oral opinions. There were amendments to the participation of representatives, the appointment of conveners, and the establishment of the review committee's responsibilities and methods of deliberation. After stopping the discussion, Chairman Yu held the original draft in his right hand and the amendment in his left hand, and voted on each article one by one. Except for Article 3, which was amended with 797 votes to "The candidates for each group of the Proposal Review Committee shall be nominated by the Presidium from the list freely determined by each representative and submitted to the General Assembly for decision. Each attending representative shall participate in one or two groups as a principle." All other articles were passed according to the original draft. The entire agenda ended at 4:30 PM.

### Representatives of the Democratic Socialist Party Talk About Not Splitting Internally

There is Also No Change in the Relationship with the Democratic League

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 26th] Yang Junmin, a representative of the Democratic Socialist Party, answered reporters' inquiries on the evening of the 26th as follows: (1) Li Daming, a representative of the Democratic Socialist Party, is currently in Honolulu but will soon leave the United States to return to China to participate in the National Assembly. (2) It is rumored that correspondence between Zhang Dongsun and Zhang Junmai involved internal party divisions, which is not true. Although Zhang Dongsun is not participating in the National Assembly, he is still united externally, and there is no division. (3) The Democratic Socialist Party's opinion on the reorganization of the government is "As stated in the previous letter to Chairman Chiang, we hope to implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference as soon as possible." (4) The number of Democratic Socialist Party members in the reorganized National Government Committee will still follow the resolution of the Political Consultative Conference, with two of the five seats occupied by the Democratic League. We do not currently wish to increase this number and will not be harsh in any aspect of our rights. (5) There is no special change in the relationship with the Democratic League, as Democratic Socialist Party members participate individually, so there is no impact. (6) A portion of the representatives from Beiping were originally scheduled to fly to Nanjing on the 26th but were delayed due to weather conditions. However, they will definitely arrive within a few days.

### Zhang Qun and Chen Lifu Host a Banquet for Representatives of the Youth Party

In addition, the Youth Party office has established a press office to coordinate with reporters. Li Huang will come to Nanjing soon. Chen Qitian recently resigned as Deputy Secretary-General of the General Assembly but has reportedly been retained.

### If the Chinese Communists Convene the So-Called National Assembly, it Will Cause Serious Consequences and Division. The Government Will Not Tolerate it.

[Logan, Special Correspondent for the United Press, Nanjing, 26th] A government spokesman stated today that if the Chinese Communists decide to convene the so-called People's Assembly of the Liberated Areas, and at the same time, the Communist army continues to attack Suinan and Yulin, the National Army will launch a punitive offensive against Yan'an.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] It has been learned from relevant sources that the Communist army has also decided to convene the People's Assembly of the Liberated Areas in Yan'an around the Double Tenth Day in response to the current convening of the National Assembly, and to formally establish a democratic coalition government. The Eighth Route Army and the Northeast Democratic Allied Army will be unified into the "People's National Army" to confront the National Government. At the same time, they will do their best to plunder and extract the property, resources, and materials of the people in the liberated areas to exchange for legal tender, gold and silver, and customs gold to hoard in the Communist areas, destroy the national economy, and expand the anti-American propaganda movement. A reporter specifically asked a military observer on the 26th about the possible consequences of this news. The answer was: Before returning to Yan'an, Chinese Communist representative Zhou Enlai publicly stated that Yan'an had no intention of convening the People's Representative Assembly of the Liberated Areas. If this is the case, then the door to negotiation has not been closed, and the National Army will have no need to attack Yan'an. However, if the Chinese Communists violate the interests of the entire people and arbitrarily convene a pseudo-National Assembly to form a separatist government and divide the country, then the people will never allow the government to sit idly by while the Chinese Communists commit treason. At that time, it may force the government army to attack Yan'an to crush its ancestral conspiracy. Another reason that may force the government army to attack Yan'an is that the Communist army in northern Shaanxi is currently continuing to attack Yulin. Yulin is the key to Suinan, and the National Army's forces there are weak. If it is captured by the Communist army, it will affect the safety of Suiyuan and Baotou. Moreover, the Communist army on the border of Shanxi and Shaanxi has captured Yonghe, Daning, and other nearby strongholds, clearly provoking the National Army. The possible consequences are unimaginable.

### Forty Captured Personnel in Changchun Have Been Released

Chen Jiazhen and Others are Still Held in Jiamusi

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 26th] Forty captured personnel in Changchun when it fell on "April 14th" were released from Jiamusi on the 25th and arrived in Changchun. It is reported that there are currently nearly one hundred of our captured personnel being held in the Jiamusi Reception Camp (Fushuntai Building), including Wang Ninghua, the Acting Chairman of Jilin Province, Zhang Jiong, the former Chief of the Changchun City Police Bureau, Chen Jiazhen, the Commander of the Changchun Defense, Li Chongguo, the Director of the Construction Department of Liaobei Province, Bai Shiyu, the Director of Education, and Ye Shaonan, the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau of the Changchun Municipal Government. In addition, Zhang Datong, the Chief Secretary of the Economic Committee, and several others were sent to Harbin several months ago in exchange with our side and are currently imprisoned there.

### Communist Army Gaoyou County Magistrate Yang Tianhua Was Captured

[Our Correspondent in Zhenjiang, 26th] Yang Tianhua, the Communist Army Gaoyou County Magistrate, was captured by the 25th Division stationed in Gaoyou Baima Temple yesterday. Two machine guns and more than ten rifles were seized on the spot, along with more than 20 Communist soldiers. He has now been handed over to the county government for legal proceedings.

### Special Envoy Marshall Left Beiping Today After Meeting with Three Representatives of the Military Mediation Department Yesterday

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 26th] Special Envoy Marshall's residence stated that Marshall will leave Beiping on the 27th. As of the night of the 26th, it is still unclear where he will go.

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 26th] Confirmed News! Marshall met with Ye Jianying on the 26th, but the content of the conversation is unknown. In the morning of the 26th, US Marine Corps Commander Howard inspected the troops at the East Military Airport. Marshall was invited to attend the ceremony at 9:15 AM. Half an hour later, he returned to the Chairman's residence. At 9:50 AM, Marshall went out again to the Military Mediation Department to discuss with Jilin. At around 11:00 AM, Ye Jianying went to the Executive Department and participated in the meeting, which lasted for an hour and a half. After the meeting, Marshall went to Sun Lianzhong's banquet, accompanied by Chen Jicheng, Jilin and his wife, and Cai Wenzhi. During the banquet, there was a lot of drinking and the guests and hosts were happy. At 2:10 PM, the banquet ended. Marshall, accompanied by Jilin and Cai Wenzhi, left for the Military Mediation Department and first spoke with Cai Wenzhi in the Chief of Staff's office for 15 minutes. At 2:35 PM, Marshall went upstairs and spoke with Jilin alone for one hour and five minutes. At 3:40 PM, Marshall returned to the Chairman's residence to rest. At 7:30 PM in the evening, Marshall hosted a banquet at the residence for General Jilin and his wife, Air Force Colonel Fan Jiusheng, and a company commander. Overall, Marshall did not engage in any socializing other than attending Sun Lianzhong's banquet, nor did he visit the Western Hills. However, he had the closest contact with Jilin and met with the responsible persons from the government and the Communist Party of the Military Mediation Department. It can be seen that Marshall's mission to the north must be related to the US military stationed in China and the Military Mediation Department. In addition to actively visiting, Marshall did not receive any guests today, not even the highest local authorities.

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 26th] Ye Jianying told reporters that he visited Marshall in a personal capacity on the morning of the 26th, but he firmly refused to answer any questions from reporters. In the afternoon, Ye met with Jilin.

### The Second Meeting of the National Assembly

— Our Reporter Pu Dejie

—Rules of Procedure Become the Center of Controversy

After the second meeting of the National Assembly adjourned at noon on the 26th, the unanimous criticism was that it was too chaotic. All that could be heard on the stage was someone repeatedly saying, "First vote to maintain the original proposal," while the audience shouted "Point of order," with everyone talking at once, upside down, and a chaotic clamor with no brilliant performance. One representative said with emotion: "No one paid attention to democracy. They neither respected it nor used it well. Fortunately, it was a review committee."

As soon as the meeting began, and the reporter had just read the minutes of the last meeting, a representative stood up abruptly, "Mr. Chairman! Are we holding a general assembly or a review committee?" Secretary-General Hong slowly replied, "The Chairman will explain later."

After Hong reported in an organized manner the results of the Presidium's summarization of the opinions on Chapter Four of the Draft Rules of Procedure the night before, he said cautiously, "Regarding this summary, the Secretariat was ordered to do some work in terms of technique. We were very careful and dared not be casual. If there is anything incorrect, please bring it up." The audience applauded in unison.

When the voting began, Ni Bi, a representative of the Soviet professional representatives on the first floor, shouted "Point of order," saying that this was a review committee and that if something had not been finished, it should be said again. During the debate in the meeting and when the final chapters were smoothly passed without objection, he repeatedly shouted "Point of order," in stark contrast to Zhang Zhijiang, a representative of the Ji District, who was always shouting "Maintain the original proposal" in the last row of the first half of the first floor.

Zhu Jingnong and Chen Changheng, one on the right and one on the left, each held a microphone in the hall waiting to speak. When an opportunity came, the two spoke together, singing a duet. Zhu had no choice but to return to his seat.

Whether it was a tactic or a habit, Chairman Yu always voted on "Maintain the original proposal" first, which initially caused opposition. "The opposing opinions should be voted on first!" "Vote on the amendment first!" "Point of order" "Hiss hiss!" For a while, the atmosphere was chaotic, the order was chaotic, the audience was dissatisfied, and the stage was at a loss. Lixuan representative Chiang Kai-shek stood up three times in anger and said loudly, "Please maintain the dignity of the representatives, especially to invite them to maintain order. This situation should not be in the National Assembly." The order was only a little better. It is said that he was already angry about the order yesterday.

Chairman Yu said in Shaanxi dialect: "All those who agree with the original text of Weite, press your respective 'doorbells'", and also made a gesture. Secretary-General Hong said during a certain vote: "There are many empty seats in the hall. Please each representative do not press the buttons on the empty seats by mistake." Someone in the press seats whispered.

During the discussion of the 26th amendment, a representative said: "A motion is not a proposal and does not need co-signature. This is enough and should be amended." Secretary-General Hong asked the meeting at Yu Yan's seat: "How about a vote?" "Good," the lights on the voting machine were bright, and the audience cheered. Although Hong could not see it on the stage, he also said when he heard the shot, "Most people have gotten used to it."

There was considerable debate about the number of supporting votes required for a temporary motion. One representative advocated "five or more," while another representative said: "Five or more is too easy, and too many temporary motions will hinder the overall situation." Secretary-General Hong then said: "I wanted to say this, but it is not good to propose it because of my position. Please pay attention to the fact that the venue is too large and there are too many people." Mai Huanxin, who was 28 years old, said upstairs: "All of our Xinjiang representatives oppose the requirement for too many supporting votes because we only have 18 representatives in total." Secretary-General Hong hurriedly explained: "The intention of this number of regulations is definitely not to restrict any part or unit of representatives." As a result, a compromise opinion of "ten or more people" was passed.

There was quite a debate about whether or not a temporary motion should be in written form. One representative said: "Without a written document, there is no basis. How can it be?" A representative said, "The establishment of a proposal is the basis." The one who said "Uh! Uh—" had not finished speaking, and someone upstairs suddenly shouted, "I have the best idea." After the entire audience listened quietly, they felt that it was not necessarily good, and after the vote, it was still necessary to have a written document.

When Chapter Four was in progress, Yu Youren's face was flushed, and he was conscientious. After Chapter Four passed, he felt greatly relieved and stood up excitedly to read the following articles, reading one chapter and asking, "Any objections?" The answer was "No objections." "If there are no objections, it is passed."

Chairman Chiang sat in seat number one when the meeting started in the morning. After the break, he left the meeting. He still attended in the afternoon. Apart from speaking to remind the audience when the order was chaotic, he did not say a word. Mrs. Chiang did not attend all day.

When discussing the organizational rules of the review committee in the afternoon, Chen Guyuan and Dai Xiujun proposed adding a second item to Article 7 to print and distribute the meeting minutes of each review committee to all representatives for reference. Shi Shangkuan proposed adding an article between Article 10 and Article 11 to revise the voting method and the conditions for the establishment of resolutions of the review committee, but none of them were approved by the General Assembly. The three legal scholars ate together

When Chairman Yu read out a certain amendment, a representative suddenly spoke. Old Yu said, "Wait, it's not over yet." When the discussion was in progress, as soon as he heard that there was an opinion, Old Yu immediately took off his glasses and looked around, saying, "Good, good." Hong Lanyou and Lei Zhen were his left and right assistants. Hong paid close attention to the meeting, and Lei fully assisted him in planning.

A reporter ran into Gui Yongqing in the meeting hall: "Deputy Commander-in-Chief, when will your reception be?" Gui smiled and said: "Soon, soon. I will ask everyone to help me create a reporter list today."

The entire afternoon session was calm and peaceful, in stark contrast to the chaos of the morning. A colleague said, "Things will turn around when they reach their extreme," and everyone ended quickly and easily.

The 26th was a day of continuous rain, and the meeting was particularly slow. The representatives, staff, and reporters all hoped that the weather would be better, and people would be in a better mood before holding the meeting again.

### Sheng Shicai's Impeachment Case, His Crimes of Violating Laws and Discipline and Committing Evils in Xinjiang are Obvious, 36 Accomplices Also Sent to Court for Trial

[Our Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] The case of Sheng Shicai, the former Chairman of Xinjiang Province, for violating laws and discipline, being cruel and corrupt, after being impeached by Supervisory Committee members Yan Zhuang and Wang Xinling, has been investigated and established by Supervisory Committee members Wan Can, Deng Chungao, etc., and transferred for disciplinary action. The criminal part of the case, involving 36 of his accomplices, has also been sent to the court for arrest and trial. It is reported that the contents of the impeachment case are roughly as follows: Since Sheng took power in the 22nd year of the Republic [1933], Xinjiang has been a de facto separate entity, and the various illegal and disciplinary violations and acts of cruelty and corruption are too numerous to count. Among his accomplices, the most notable are 36 people, ten of whom are bloodthirsty by nature, and newcomers turn pale at the mention of them, calling them the Ten Butchers, showing their ferocity. Sheng's main crimes include the following: (1) Abuse of more than 20 kinds of bizarre torture instruments to torture and kill the innocent, with verifiable cases reaching 80,000 people, and countless others secretly executed. (2) Prisons are all over Xinjiang, and there are 12 in Dihua alone. The abandoned coal kiln in Liudaogou in the area is where the innocent were tortured and killed in those years. (3) Almost all the property of the imprisoned was confiscated, and their families were exiled, and there are still people in the Ashan Ili area who cannot return. (4) When Sheng left Xinjiang, there were still more than 3,000 people in prison, and Sheng planned to kill them, but he was rescued and spared. (5) During Sheng's ten years in power, all the people's possessions were plundered. When Sheng left, the treasures were all taken away, which was witnessed by the citizens of Dihua. The theft and sale by his accomplices is even more difficult to count. The Xinjiang Provisional Senate made accusations against Sheng's various crimes in the 34th year of the Republic, and the facts are detailed in the "A Brief Account of Sheng Shicai's Calamities in Xinjiang" compiled by the people of Xinjiang. The Dihua District Court also submitted a list.

The reporter, considering the importance of this case, visited the Supervisory Committee members Yan Zhuang and Wang Xinling, who filed the impeachment, but they were away on official business. Therefore, he visited the investigator of the case, Supervisory Committee member Wan Can, who said that the two Supervisory Courts are responsible for maintaining integrity, and that the merits and demerits of the senior officials in the frontier areas should be handled based on national interests, government laws, and the voice of the people. At the same time, in order to maintain national rights and stabilize the people's hearts, special attention is also paid to this case. After reviewing everything (Wan referring to himself), he believed that he had to agree, so he agreed to the establishment of this case. Wan also talked about his feelings about Sheng's various crimes against the country, saying: Xinjiang Province has formed an inseparable part of the Chinese nation for more than 2,000 years, and the relationship is extremely natural. During the Tang Dynasty, it also assisted in resolving internal difficulties, and the local ethnic groups called the Tang the Tian Kehan. Sheng took advantage of the times and seized the area. His policy was fundamentally wrong, not only ignoring the world situation and national policy, but also completely disregarding the interests of the local people. As a result, the entire interests of the Republic of China were affected, and ethnic minorities also suffered losses. For the sake of the country and the people, this kind of crime cannot but be investigated.

Not Moving a Muscle

Knew There Was This End

At 10:30 a.m. this morning, Xiang was taken out of prison, his hair disheveled, wearing a blue cloth gown, cloth shoes and white socks, quite calm. After being escorted to the court, the presiding judge Xu Zhennan asked his age, place of origin, and position, and then read the main text of the judgment, saying: "Xiang Zhizhuang, colluding with enemy countries, plotting to resist the state, sentenced to death, deprived of public rights for life, and property confiscated except for a reasonable amount to provide for the necessary living expenses of his family." And said: This judgment has been approved by the chief of staff and transferred to the chairman, and will be executed today. After hearing the judgment, Xiang did not move a muscle, as if he had known there was this end.

Requesting Paper and Pen

Drafted Three Wills

The presiding judge asked again if he had anything to say. Xiang replied loudly, "No!" His tone was quite decisive, but he asked for paper and pen to draft three wills in cursive script for his second younger brother, Xiang Huimin. The contents were: (1) The body should be provided to the hospital for dissection and research, and there is no need to return it to the place of origin. (2) Do not hang mourning in the house. (3) Do not mourn, work hard, and live peacefully. After writing, he threw away the pen and followed the soldiers out the door.

Before the Execution

Actually Smiling

At the gate of the court, Xiang requested "no need to tie up," and the guards replied, "This is the procedure." Xiang smiled and let them tie him up. Later, he felt that the binding was too tight and asked for it to be lighter. The guard said with a smile: "It will be good when you get there." Xiang smiled, as if nothing had happened. He was tied up at 10:40, helped onto a truck with a machine gun already set up, and driven towards Yuhuatai at a speed of sixty kilometers per hour. At 10:50 a.m.

A Loud Bang

Applause Erupted

When he arrived at Yuhuatai, Xiang's expression was nervous. When he was pushed to an open space, he knelt straight down on the damp ground. The gun pointed at the back of his heart, and with a loud bang, Xiang fell to the ground. The onlookers in the surrounding garden applauded. This traitor was thus killed. The body lay on the dirty, wet ground, waiting for his family to come and collect it.

Editorial

### The Road to China's Economic Recovery

Since the signing of the Sino-U.S. Treaty of Commerce, American businessmen in China have actively begun their business activities, which has not only caused misunderstandings among some people in our country but also caused British parliamentarians to express great anxiety, demanding that Parliament send a delegation to China to conduct an on-the-spot investigation of our political and economic situation. Judging from the provisions of the Sino-U.S. Treaty of Commerce alone, it is indeed easy to cause misunderstandings. Some Chinese newspapers have even bluntly stated that this is a new unequal treaty. British parliamentarians also bluntly said: "Americans are now exerting pressure on China, attempting to shut British businessmen out of China." The clouds of suspicion and apprehension caused by this Sino-U.S. Treaty of Commerce seem to be growing thicker day by day, both domestically and abroad, and it is indeed necessary to dispel them. Ambassador Stuart Leighton spoke to the press in Shanghai the other day, clarifying the spirit of the Sino-U.S. Treaty of Commerce, on the one hand, stating that China does not lose its tariff autonomy and its power to control shipping and foreign trade; on the other hand, he solemnly stated: "The United States does not want and has not obtained special rights in China." British parliamentarians, after hearing this, can also stop worrying that "the United States is making China shut British businessmen out of China."

The spirit of the Sino-U.S. Treaty of Commerce is entirely based on the principle of equality and reciprocity. Indeed, the United States is a capitalist country that has reached the highest stage of industrial development, while China is an industrially backward agricultural country, especially after eight years of war, which has left the country scarred. No matter how eloquently we talk about the principle of equality and reciprocity in trade between China and the United States, in reality, China is neither able to be on an equal footing with the United States nor can it enjoy the "benefits" that the United States gives us. However, our country is currently in a period of national construction. Not only is everything backward, requiring us to catch up quickly, but also everything needs to be rebuilt, and the material needs are very urgent, especially the need for economic assistance and cooperation from friendly allied countries. The United States provided us with tremendous military assistance during the War of Resistance, and now during the period of national construction, the United States is still very willing to assist China in economic construction, in order to complete its great cause of national construction. Its motive is entirely for the peace and prosperity of the Far East, and at the same time for the peace and prosperity of the world, without harboring any selfish ambitions or attempting to obtain special rights in China to monopolize the entire Chinese market. Therefore, China does not doubt that the United States harbors any ambitions and resolutely signed the Treaty of Commerce with the United States, but in its heart, it still insists on two conditions, with no room for concession or compromise.

The first is that sovereignty must not be infringed. Although the Sino-U.S. Treaty of Commerce grants most-favored-nation treatment to each other based on the principle of equality and reciprocity, our autonomy over tariffs, our control over navigation, and our right to restrict import and export trade cannot be infringed by other countries under any circumstances. Especially since our country's industry is backward, it is necessary to adopt appropriate protection policies. Recently, the Executive Yuan revised the measures for import and export trade, including the following three items: (1) increasing the rates for some imported goods; (2) restricting or even prohibiting unnecessary imported goods; (3) encouraging and facilitating much-needed imported goods such as machinery and transportation equipment. The United States has not expressed any objections to this, which proves that the so-called Sino-U.S. Treaty of Commerce is actually a new unequal treaty, which is completely a misinterpretation.

The second is that we do not want to favor one over the other. China's current foreign policy and its foreign trade policy, in a nutshell, are to work together with "nations that treat us equally" to jointly maintain world peace and promote human prosperity and happiness. Therefore, any friendly or allied country is treated equally, and there is absolutely no discrimination. China is willing to conclude a treaty of commerce with the United States based on the principle of equality and reciprocity, and it is also willing to use this as a basis for negotiation to conclude a treaty of commerce with other countries. The British trade delegation's visit to China has also been widely welcomed by the Chinese people, which is good proof. It is unreasonable for British parliamentarians to worry that China will willingly allow the United States to monopolize the market and exclude businessmen from other countries. This may be due to isolation. Once the British trade delegation returns home, it will be able to understand the actual situation in China, and the doubts caused by the signing of the Treaty of Commerce between China and the United States will be dispelled. At the same time, judging from the trade policy of the United States, it has consistently advocated international free trade and opposed any country monopolizing the market. As the saying goes, "Do not do to others what you do not want others to do to you." The United States has no intention of monopolizing the Chinese market. Therefore, Ambassador Stuart Leighton also said the other day: "The United States does not want and has not obtained special rights in China."

The above two points are the common principles for China to conclude new treaties of commerce with various countries. However, China's conclusion of new treaties of commerce with various countries is the first step for China to achieve equality in treaties. If we can use this as a starting point and strive for progress, it will not be difficult to catch up with other countries. However, if we are only satisfied with equality in words, it is definitely not true equality and can be called "false equality." Under the circumstances of false equality in our country, we will not only feel disappointed because the benefits are only verbal and not real, but we will also suffer losses everywhere. Therefore, we have to go a step further and seek the realization of true equality. At present, China's actual economic situation can be observed from two aspects. On the one hand, export trade is in a state of suffocation; on the other hand, foreign goods are flooding the market, making the entire economic structure on the verge of collapse. There are many factors that cause the former situation, among which the most important reasons are: first, the exchange rate cannot be balanced, and the value of the Chinese currency is too high, which makes it impossible for Chinese exports to gain a market abroad; second, the backwardness of Chinese agriculture, which makes it impossible to improve the quality of exports. Adjusting the exchange rate is not a simple problem, and one move is enough to affect the overall situation, which requires careful consideration. As for improving agriculture, it is an extremely complex problem that cannot be solved overnight. There are countless factors that cause the latter situation. The result of the flooding of the market with foreign goods is that the national industry, which is already congenitally deficient, will be completely destroyed.

But how to save China's economic crisis? Leaving aside the palliative measures, the only fundamental solution is to improve agricultural production. After the Sino-U.S. Agricultural Technology Cooperation inspected agriculture throughout the country, it issued a suggestion, proposing seven concrete measures: (1) Promote agricultural education, with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Ministry of Education cooperating earnestly; (2) Provide low-interest agricultural loans to improve the transportation and marketing of agricultural products, improve the tenancy system, and implement the land law promulgated by the government; (3) Establish a national agricultural bank to coordinate the country's agricultural finance; (4) Establish an agricultural management bureau to handle animal and plant quarantine and grading and inspection of agricultural products; (5) The government should encourage the use of chemical fertilizers for agricultural materials, farmland water conservancy, and awards; (7) For the main agricultural products for export, exports should be encouraged. These seven measures are practical and easy to implement, and our government should indeed study them. Baker, an American professor at Jinling University, has been in China for many years and knows the actual situation of our country's agriculture well. He recently stated that he also hopes that our government can adopt them.

In short, we cannot find fault with the Sino-U.S. Treaty of Commerce itself; but as an industrially backward agricultural country, how can our country be on a truly equal footing with a capitalist country that has reached the peak of industrial development, so as to enjoy its "benefits" without suffering losses? This requires our "self-reliance." The relationship between "countries" is no different from the relationship between "people." "A gentleman strives for self-improvement," and the country must also "strive for self-improvement," especially China, which is backward in every way, and especially needs to be self-reliant, work harder, overcome economic difficulties, and reach the stage of industrial development, so as to move from the stage of "false equality" to the stage of true equality.

### Bandit Leader Xue Yonghui, a Traitor Who Once Served in a Puppet Position, Now Leads Troops to Harass Taihu Lake; The Jiangsu High Procuratorate Indicts Him and Fellow Traitor Cai Haogong

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou] The Jiangsu High Procuratorate has recently issued an order to arrest Cai Haogong and Xue Yonghui. The original indictment states that Haogong, also known as Cai Sanle, served as the commander of the puppet Taihu Independent National Salvation Army in 1942, and was later appointed as the captain of the puppet Cleansing the Countryside Inspection Team, and the chief of the Investigation and Operations Section of the puppet Special Operations Nantong Station. In 1945, he was reassigned as the chief of the Taihu Branch of the puppet Military Affairs Commission's Water Transport Bureau. After the victory, he briefly served in the Changshu County anti-infiltration work, but was soon eliminated. Xue Yonghui served as the deputy commander of the puppet Taihu Independent National Salvation Army. Both of them ran rampant on Taihu Lake and committed all kinds of evil deeds. Recently, police were ordered to investigate and arrest them, but because the defendants' whereabouts were unknown, they could not be arrested, which proves their guilt and fear of punishment, and they should be publicly prosecuted according to law. It is reported that Cai and Xue are now leading troops to harass the Guangfu-Zhenrenqiao area, calling themselves the "New Fourth Army," and committing all kinds of evil deeds.

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou] The Yangcheng District Suppression Headquarters interrogated recidivist bandit Li Gancai at 9:30 a.m. on the 24th. Li bandit had gathered a crowd in the alleys of Kunshan to rob rice boats. After the 4th Battalion of the parachute regiment stationed in Kunshan pursued and suppressed him, the bandit dared to open fire to resist arrest. After being captured, the military court of the Yangcheng District Suppression Headquarters confirmed the facts. Commander Ma approved the Wuxi Command's decision to execute him on the spot. When he was brought forward for sentencing, Li bandit was dying due to injuries sustained while resisting arrest. Four paratroopers wrapped the criminal in a cotton quilt and brought him before the court. The criminal knew that death was imminent and was trembling uncontrollably. The Chief of the Military Court, Director Song, personally questioned him about his name and age, confirmed his identity, pinned the sentence notice to the criminal's chest, and then several paratroopers carried him onto a jeep. Military Judge Li Binjiang served as the execution supervisor and rode in the jeep to the Wangshudun execution ground. A paratrooper carried out the execution, firing five shots to end his life. More than a thousand onlookers applauded and cheered. Afterwards, the unit specifically posted notices inside and outside the city, detailing the crimes, so that everyone would know.

### Qingdao City Council's Suggestion to Sell Enemy and Puppet Assets to Compensate People's Losses

[Our Newspaper, Qingdao] The Qingdao City Council believes that the losses suffered by the people since the War of Resistance are enormous. After the restoration, anti-war loss investigation committees were established in various places by order, and all people's losses have mostly been reported in accordance with the instructions. However, it has been a long time, and there is still no progress. The general public is deeply disappointed. If this loss is specifically waiting for reparations from the enemy, it is feared that it will be a distant prospect. It seems that the proceeds from the sale of enemy and puppet assets should be used to compensate the people's anti-war losses as soon as possible, so that rural areas and industrial and commercial enterprises can be restored. This has been resolved by the first general meeting of the council, requesting the Executive Yuan to issue a general order to receiving agencies in various places to use the proceeds from the sale of enemy assets to compensate the people's losses as soon as possible.

### Suzhou Street Vendors Oppose Centralized Operations; Designated Locations Are All Too Remote

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou] In order to rectify the city's appearance, the Suzhou authorities strictly ordered the police bureau to order its subordinates to ban street vendors. However, in order to take into account the livelihood of these people, they specifically designated the sidewalk behind the Beiju National Goods Company and two locations inside the No. 1 Tianmen New Market as centralized operating locations for street vendors. Although some street vendors have been ordered to go there, both of the above-mentioned locations are located in remote areas with few pedestrians, and their livelihoods are bleak, and their lives are on the verge of despair. At 2:00 p.m. on the 24th, the Suzhou street vendor representatives specifically asked the authorities for permission to hold a meeting at the Leiyi of Xuanmiao Temple. More than 300 street vendors attended. Zhou, a street vendor from Guanqian Street, was temporarily elected as chairman. As a result of the collective deliberations, everyone agreed that since the victory a year ago, national goods and industry have been affected by the dumping of foreign goods, and business is unsustainable. Many employees have been laid off, and the number of unemployed people is increasing day by day. Therefore, it is as difficult as ascending to heaven to find a place to eat. Life is difficult, and they have no choice but to pawn their belongings and gather meager funds to set up stalls in order to earn a small profit and avoid freezing and starvation. The suffering in this situation is not something that those who have not experienced it can understand. Now, the authorities are rectifying the city's appearance and ordering street vendors to operate in designated locations. They should have obeyed the order and went there, but the designated locations are remote and sparsely populated, and there are few customers. How can their income maintain their livelihoods? Therefore, it was decided on the spot to jointly petition the authorities to show compassion for the hardships of the street vendors and to allow them to continue to set up stalls in their original locations. However, in order to maintain order, they specifically formulated management measures themselves and submitted them for adoption at the same time.

### Bengbu Salt Dispute, Salt Merchants Oppose Rotation System

[Our Bengbu Correspondent] The internal dispute over the collection of membership fees by the Bengbu Huaiyan Transport Merchants Association has yet to be resolved, and the salt distributors in the city have recently opposed the rotation system. Before the military uprising, the prices of salt catties sold by transport merchants were mostly inconsistent, so they competed to sell them for fear of falling behind. Later, in order to adapt to the requirements of the environment, the transport merchants association submitted an application to the competent salt affairs agency to create a system of selling in rotation, referred to as the rotation system. After the victory, the transport merchants returned one after another and resumed their old business. They still resumed the old system of rotation. It has now been sold to the sixth round, and the price range has been evaluated by the transport merchants association to be between 32,000 yuan and 113,000 yuan per dan. General distributors in Bengbu who operate salt for food have recently believed that the soaring salt prices are due to transport merchants manipulating salt prices and increasing the burden on the people. The rotation system is indeed a bad step. Therefore, they are very active in opposing the rotation system, but both sides are based on their own interests, and their subjective prejudices are too deep, so it is difficult to resolve them for a while.

### Results of French Local Senate Elections: Popular Republican Movement Takes the Lead, Communist Party Still Demands the Position of Prime Minister but Hopes Have Diminished

[Reuters, Paris, 25th] The Popular Republican Movement has finally taken the lead in Sunday's elections. The Ministry of the Interior corrected the election results announced this morning this afternoon. The accurate final results are that 24,751 members of the Popular Republican Movement were elected, and a total of 24,544 members of the Communist Party and the quasi-Communist Republican Resistance Alliance were elected. This correction has a great psychological impact. The setbacks of the Popular Republican Movement in the last general election may be compensated in the Senate election on December 8. In Sunday's election, only 18 million voters voted out of 25 million voters, and about 27.6% abstained; while in the last general election, only 21.6% abstained. The superiority of the Popular Republican Movement can increase its opposition to the Communist Party's appointment as prime minister. The Communist Party has not yet given up this demand, but its hope of success has diminished. According to the new French constitution, the Senate has no power to veto the appointment of the prime minister. The successor is appointed by the president and approved by the House of Representatives. However, the results of Sunday's election can reduce the Communist Party's excuse to serve as prime minister. At the same time, the Popular Republican Movement can also expect to obtain greater concessions from the Communist Party in negotiating the organization of a coalition government.

### Before Forming a Cabinet with the Communist Party, the People's Party Will Propose Three Agreements

Although many leaders of the Popular Republican Movement believe that it is impossible to refuse the Communist Party's participation in the professional government, they will insist that before agreeing to form a cabinet with the Communist Party at the same time, the two sides should reach an agreement on the following three points: (1) Agree on a political program, especially a plan for financial reform. It is still remembered that although the cabinet agreed on a wage and price freeze policy in June this year, the Communist Party still launched a movement to demand higher wages through the General Confederation of Labor. (2) All cabinet members should bear genuine collective responsibility. The Popular Republican Movement has not forgotten that the policies passed by the previous Communist cabinet members were used by the Communist newspapers to attack non-Communist cabinet members. Today, 35,000 union members in Paris demonstrated under the leadership of Labor Party personnel, criticizing the government's food policy. People from the Popular Republican Movement believe that this is because the government's parties have failed to fully bear collective responsibility. (3) Each department must not be controlled by the party. The Popular Republican Movement feels that the ministers of some departments in the past have the intention of occupying the department for a long time, so they remove those who have served for a long time and have rich experience from the important positions they occupy, and replace them with party members of the same party. Such phenomena must be eliminated in the future.

### The Bidault Cabinet Will End in Early January

The Bidault cabinet will resign when the House of Representatives holds its first meeting next Thursday. Political figures predict that the House of Representatives will ask the current government to continue to serve until the president of the Republic is elected in January next year. Although the powers of the Senate are only advisory, the Senate members have the right to propose laws and may send bills back to the House of Representatives for reconsideration; after being sent back, they must be adopted by an absolute majority, and even if the Communist Party and the Socialist Party are united in the House of Representatives, they cannot reach the number of an absolute majority.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 25th] Regarding the results of the "elector" election in the French Senate, after the French official announcement, the Ministry of the Interior issued a statement correcting it. Briefly said: The Popular Republican Movement has a total of 24,751 electors elected in the 89 provinces of the French mainland (excluding Corsica), not 24,151. As for the number of "electors" elected by the Communist Party, it is still 24,271. Therefore, in terms of the mainland of France, the Popular Republican Party has a slight advantage over the Communist Party. A total of 2,699 "electors" were elected by the Independent Republican Party, not 3,299. In addition, according to the election results of French Algeria received here: the Socialist-Communist United faction has an advantage, with a total of 1,136 "electors" elected, which is approximately equivalent to three-fifths of the total. The Popular Republican Movement, the Radical Socialist Party, and the right-wing group are in second place. Local observers believe that the reason why the left-wing group won is because fewer of its members abstained than the steady faction and the right-wing people.

### The Final Results Are Yet to Be Revealed

[Reuters, Paris, 25th] The Communist Party and the Popular Republican Movement have formed a race in the election of senators. After the results of Corsica Island were revealed, the situation changed again. 244 members of the Communist Party were elected in the area, while only 4 members of the Popular Republican Movement were elected. The remaining Radical Party won 209 members, the Independent Republican Party won 106 members, and the de Gaulle League won 5 members. The partial results of the vote count in Algeria showed that the Popular Republican Movement. The Radical Party, the Free Republican Party, and the Independent Party won a total of 804 members, while the Communist Party and the Socialist Party won a total of 92 members. Therefore, the situation of the Communist Party and the Popular Republican Movement can be determined only after the total election results of the area are revealed.

[United Press, New York, 25th] The victory of the Communist Party in the French general election may encounter another difficulty in the four-power talks on the German peace that have been delayed for a long time. News has been circulating in Paris that the new French government is preparing to deal with the future of Germany, which is currently the biggest problem in the world. The issue should be in January or after January next year. However, the four-power foreign ministers' meeting reached an agreement in early autumn this year to start preliminary discussions here in the near future. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes will not forget this agreement, because he has always insisted that no progress can be made in the effort for world peace until the great powers have some understanding of the German problem.

### China's Proposal to Investigate Non-Self-Governing Territories Was Rejected

[United Press, Chenggong Lake, 25th] China's proposal to investigate non-self-governing territories was rejected by the Economic and Political Committee of the United Nations today. This issue was originally raised by Romulo, the head of the Philippine delegation, who accused those who maintain colonies of being selfish and self-interested. The Chinese delegation then proposed authorizing the Trusteeship Committee to submit reports on areas that have not yet achieved self-government, which was rejected today by ten votes to nine. The United States, Britain, France, the Netherlands, and other countries all voted against it.

### Investigation of Foreign Troop Deployments: Three Powers Remain Divided, U.S. Emphasizes Disarmament as Paramount

[Special Dispatch from Our Correspondent in New York, 26th] The Political and Security Committee of the United Nations General Assembly has been discussing the issue of troop deployments in various countries for four days now, but the divergence of opinions among the three major powers remains unresolved. Today, U.S. Senator Connally and British Representative Noel-Baker presented the views of the U.S. and U.K. to the committee. The U.S. stood by its original position, calling for U.N. member states to disclose the numbers of their domestic and foreign troops. The U.K. abandoned its original stance that the issue of troop deployments in various countries should be part of a comprehensive disarmament plan and endorsed the U.S. proposal, calling for the adoption of an inspection system to ensure that all member states accurately report their domestic and foreign troop numbers.

[United Press, Lake Success, 26th] An authoritative source stated today that the U.S. is prepared to strongly urge U.N. bodies to take immediate action on procedures for limiting world armaments, including international control of atomic energy. The U.S. delegation is eager to temporarily abandon the issue of countries reporting military strength and focus its efforts on disarmament matters. The U.S. delegation believes that disarmament is the most important issue currently facing the 54 members of the Political and Security Committee of the U.N., and therefore, the U.S. "understands" that it will oppose the British proposal, which is the Soviet demand for "on-site" investigation of military strength. It is understood that the U.S. feels that if the proposal to investigate military strength is passed, the major issue of limiting troops will be indefinitely delayed for discussion.

### UN General Assembly Representative Urges Reconciliation between South Africa and India

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 25th] The Political and Legal Joint Committee of the United Nations General Assembly met today to discuss India's accusation against South Africa regarding its treatment of Indian expatriates.

General Assembly on the measures taken on this issue, and that both parties should revise their relations in accordance with international treaties.

### US and Soviet Foreign Ministers Hold Secret Talks Yesterday

Several Points on the Trieste Issue

Agreement Reached by Four Foreign Ministers

[United Press International, New York, 25th] The four foreign ministers held a short meeting today and, with concessions from Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, reached several points of agreement on the status of Trieste. However, important issues such as the withdrawal of foreign troops from Trieste, Italian reparations to Greece and Albania, and compensation for losses suffered by Allied nationals in Italy remain unresolved. Prior to the four foreign ministers' meeting, the U.S. and Soviet foreign ministers held a secret one-hour meeting to discuss various points of the Italian peace treaty. It is reported that Molotov assured Byrnes that the slow progress of the four foreign ministers' meeting was not due to deliberate obstruction by the Soviet Union; in fact, the Soviet Union was eager to reach an agreement quickly.

### Riots Erupt in Cairo, British Military Headquarters Bombed, Egyptian Parliament Holds Secret Meeting Yesterday

[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 26th Broadcast: Student demonstrations in Egypt are escalating. Police opened fire on the demonstrators, resulting in one student being killed. Students shouted slogans against the unequal Anglo-Egyptian treaty. Seven of the twelve representatives involved in the treaty negotiations opposed the current draft, believing that the term of British troop presence was too long and that Egypt would become a British military base after the treaty was signed.

[Reuters, Cairo, 26th] Prime Minister Sidky Pasha issued a public statement yesterday condemning the acts of violence that have occurred in Cairo in recent days. The authorities have arrested sixty students responsible for the incidents in schools throughout the city. The public statement also stated that the government has ordered the police not to act rashly even when provoked, but to use force when necessary to stop violence. The riots were backed by political groups and were provided with money and weapons. The purpose of the demonstrations was to force the government to resign or to prevent the Anglo-Egyptian negotiations from succeeding. Student demonstrations and riots also occurred in Alexandria today, and the military police were ordered to be on alert. Alexandria and Cairo have both been declared off-limits to British troops. The British military headquarters in Cairo was bombed shortly after midnight last night, causing only damage to the entrance, with no further losses. The situation remained stable throughout the day, but the atmosphere remained extremely tense.

[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 25th] The Egyptian parliament decided to hold a secret meeting tomorrow, at which the government will report on the negotiation process led by Prime Minister Sidky Pasha in the U.K. If the Egyptian government can obtain the support of a majority of parliamentarians, the Foreign Minister will travel to London to sign a new treaty with the U.K., which will then be submitted to parliament for ratification.

### Greater Syria Plan Opposed by Saudi Arabia

[Agence France-Presse, Syrian Capital, 26th] The "Al-Watan" newspaper quoted a Jerusalem correspondent as reporting that the announcement by the King of Transjordan of his intention to organize a "Greater Syria Kingdom" has caused painful feelings in Arab political circles. This plan was instigated by foreign powers and did not originate from the Arabs. Saudi Arabia will not hesitate to use force, if necessary, to prevent the establishment of Greater Syria.

[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 26th] A Lebanese newspaper reported that the King of Transjordan intends to organize a "Greater Syria Kingdom" with Damascus as its capital. This claim was formally denied by the Transjordanian delegation of the Arab League.

[Reuters, London, 25th] A Foreign Office spokesperson stated that the British government has not promised the King of Transjordan that part or all of Palestine will become part of "Greater Syria." According to recent reports, the King of Transjordan had stated that he had obtained formal assurances that he could become the king of "Greater Syria" and that part or all of Palestine would be part of "Greater Syria."

The tension in Palestine is unprecedented, and the city of Jerusalem now resembles a battlefield, with barbed wire and other obstacles everywhere. Cannons, machine guns, and tanks are also positioned at critical points. The Jewish underground army has formed three divisions totaling approximately 100,000 people, who are brave and skilled in combat.

[Agence France-Presse, Tehran, 26th] The leader of Iranian Azerbaijan province, Pishevari, stated today in his official newspaper that if the government orders an attack on Azerbaijan province, the guerrilla forces of Azerbaijan province will rise up to resist. The Azerbaijan provincial authorities have always been conciliatory, and the government's dispatch of troops to Azerbaijan province is absolutely illegal. On the other hand, the official newspaper of Prime Minister Sultana, "Iran Democrat," warned Azerbaijan province not to oppose the government army, as the government's decision is unwavering and will definitely be implemented.

[Reuters, Tehran, 25th] Tehran Radio reported that the Soviet Ambassador to Iran, Sakov, visited Iranian Prime Minister Sultana last night, and British Ambassador Roger Etherington visited Sultana and Iranian Foreign Ministry officials this morning. The content of the talks was not disclosed.

### New Discovery in Atomic Fission in Soviet Union

[United Press, Moscow, 26th] Soviet scientists have announced that Professor Kurchatov has discovered a new method of atomic fission, but the details of the experiment have not been disclosed. Kurchatov is known for his research on heavy atoms. According to Pravda, the Soviet Academy of Sciences has newly appointed five professors of theoretical and experimental physics, and Kurchatov is one of them. Others include Skobeltsyn, who has made many new discoveries about cosmic rays. The London News Chronicle also carried a dispatch from Istanbul stating that the Soviet Union is secretly building a "giant atomic energy plant" in the mountains near Sukhumi on the Black Sea coast, near Mount Elbrus, the highest peak in Europe, which is approximately 18,442 feet high. The area around the plant is protected by a large number of military police, and vehicles are not allowed to pass without prior permission. The materials and labor required for the plant have the highest priority. It is estimated that its scale is comparable to that of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, USA.

### U.S. Navy Deploys Secret Wartime Telephone: Relays Messages Through Invisible Light Rays

[United Press, Washington, 25th] It was announced here today that the U.S. Navy invented a secret telephone during the war that relays messages through invisible light rays. Details are still subject to security restrictions and are not announced, but according to official explanations, it uses infrared rays. This machine has a "line of sight" range, similar to television, and can avoid being intercepted like ultra-high frequency radio waves. It can be used for conversations on nearby ships or on shipboard. The application range of the infrared telephone is limited to the horizontal line, with a distance of about eight kilometers between warships and bridges. However, when transmitting messages on land, it is easy to transmit point by point where wires cannot be installed and radio telephones can be intercepted.

### U.S. Miners' Union President Disregards Law, Lewis Complies with Subpoena, Trial Scheduled to Begin Formally Today

[Reuters, Washington, 25th] John L. Lewis, leader of the United States' 400,000 coal miners, appeared in Washington Federal Court today in response to a subpoena. His lawyer, Hopekin, finally stated to the court that Lewis was prepared to appear for trial next Wednesday to answer the charges of contempt of court. The hearing lasted 35 minutes, and Lewis remained silent throughout. His lawyer pointed out that Lewis's defense was based on two main points: first, that the Phosphorus Workers Association had taken no action after receiving the government's order; and second, that the court's injunction exceeded its authority. Assistant Prosecutor Sonnet argued that Lewis and his union had acted in contempt of court and requested that the court hold a hearing on the contempt case at 3:00 PM on the 27th of this month. Judge Coggin sternly warned Lewis that the case was of great importance and hoped that the union would not take measures that would force Congress to further restrict the power of unions. Hopekin requested the court to postpone the trial, but the prosecutor opposed it, arguing that the coal mine strike was causing significant losses to the country and could not be delayed unless the workers first returned to work. Lewis shook his head in refusal, and Judge Coggin announced his decision to formally open the trial on Wednesday. Upon hearing this, Lewis smiled, bowed, and withdrew.

### Electricity Conservation Strictly Enforced in Eastern States

[United Press, Washington, 25th] The behind-the-scenes developments of the coal mine strike are as follows: (1) The Solid Fuels Administration has ordered all schools, federal and state government departments to apply to Washington for anthracite coal supply. Public utilities, food factories, hospitals and other coal-using businesses are given priority, or can directly hire from retailers. (2) The Civilian Production Administration has ordered an immediate investigation into whether electricity conservation movements in 21 states are being followed. (3) American steel companies have announced that they will do their best to reduce work at various factories. (4) Civil Life Party Senator Robert has once again called on President Truman to resign and for the Republican Party to govern. (5) The authorities of Virginia sued Lewis, President of the Miners' Union, in accordance with the law.

### Pridi Lost in America

### Japanese Special Diet Opens, One-Month Session to Discuss Fate of Imperial Household, Yoshida Cabinet's Future Uncertain

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] The 91st Special Session of the Japanese Diet opened this morning. At 11:00 a.m., the Imperial Rescript was read, and the ceremony was as usual. The Emperor rode in a large red car, followed by white jeeps of the U.S. Military Police. Communist members who fundamentally oppose the existence of the Emperor attended the session. After the ceremony, members of the House of Representatives drafted a response to the Emperor's Rescript.

[Reuters, Tokyo, 26th] The 91st session of the Japanese Diet officially began this morning. The one-month session will discuss matters related to the Constitution and the fate of the Imperial Household.

[Kaizosha, Tokyo, 26th] The Japanese Provisional Diet opened today with a speech by Prime Minister Yoshida outlining his policy direction, followed by questions and speeches by Diet members. It is concerned how Yoshida's cabinet will safely pass through this meeting period. Judging from the current political situation in Japan, Yoshida's cabinet faces a difficult situation. (1) The Socialist Party will stand in a purely opposition position and resolutely attempt to dissolve the Diet. (2) The labor unrest of the Electric Power Industry Workers' Union under the Socialist Party system is also sufficient to threaten the cabinet. (3) Due to the expansion of the scope of the purge order, the Progressive and Liberal Parties of the government party will be greatly affected. Therefore, in order to avoid collapse, the Yoshida Cabinet must implement effective policies to stabilize workers' lives, prevent inflation, and revitalize the rural economy.

### Japanese Reparations List, Revised and Publicized

The selling price is less than $10,000.

### Indian Political Crisis Intensifies, Wavell has Requested Instructions from London

[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 25th United Press] Political sources: Viceroy Wavell has urgently requested instructions from London on how to handle the Indian political crisis. The Viceroy's request was issued after Nehru sent him a formal written notice. The written notice requested the Viceroy to allow the members of the Muslim League in the provisional government to resign en masse if the League does not want to participate in the Constituent Assembly to be convened on December 9. The Viceroy has sent his correspondence with Nehru and Jinnah to London. He expects that the current crisis will become more serious this week, and future developments will depend on whether the Muslim League modifies its decision to withdraw recognition of the British government's long-term plan for Indian independence, or withdraw from the provisional government.

### Economic Competition Between China and Japan Begins, Our Business Community Should Pay Attention, Japanese Silk Will Monopolize the World Market with U.S. Support

[Reuters, London, 25th] The Manchester Guardian published an article stating that Japan is now laying the foundation for becoming a major manufacturing and exporting country in Asia. At the end of August 1946, one year after the end of the war, Japan's foreign trade surplus had reached 51,792,000 yen (equivalent to £857,000). Within the year, Japan exported raw silk, tin, lead, tea, semi-rubber, antimony, etc. worth £25,241,000, and imported raw cotton and food worth £24,384,000. Although the Allied Supreme Commander's Headquarters has stated that any member state of the United Nations can apply to trade with Japan, almost all of Japan's imports to date have been supplied by the United States, and 67.6% of Japan's exports have been purchased by the United States. Among all future plans, the textile plan is the most complete and important. Once this plan is realized, people in Asian countries will again wear clothes made in Japan, which is not far away. Japan is now engaged in exporting raw silk and silk products, and will soon export cotton yarn and cloth to Asian countries. According to official estimates, Japan will restore its pre-war position in the Far East market within three years at most. By 1951, Japan will almost monopolize the world silk market. 50% of Japan's raw cotton used to be imported from India, but now it comes from the United States, and it is now planned to import 890,000 bales from the United States. Due to labor shortages, production by the end of this year will be lower than expected, but by 1947, Japan will have a surplus of yarn and cloth for export to Burma, Malaya, East Indies, and India. Japan will be able to obtain foreign loans for importing food and paying for occupation fees. Officials of the Allied Headquarters believe that their plans will be promoted unhindered despite opposition, and that China's suggestion to ban Japan from military foreign trade within ten years is ridiculous. They expressed doubt that China could take Japan's place in the textile industry within ten years, and said that in any case, the people of Asia cannot wait long for cheap imports. British, American, and Indian textile merchants may raise stronger reactions, but because they are currently preoccupied with other matters, this reaction will not take effect within two or three years. The Manchester Guardian reads that the plan for the Japanese silk industry is even more ambitious than that of the cotton textile industry. The world's future demand for silk will be 30 million pounds per year, but the Allied Headquarters plans to have Japan produce 35 million pounds in 1951, effectively monopolizing the world market. In 1940, Japan's silk production was close to 95 million pounds, about half of which was exported. At the end of the war, Japan could only produce about 13.5 million pounds per year. Production is gradually increasing, but due to the lack of dry cocoons, production this winter may decrease, but will increase after the cocoon harvest in the early next year. Although officials expressed great sympathy for the Chinese silk industry, they politely declined China's request. The authorities privately admitted that they do not plan to assist China with machinery or any other items, except for allocating dry cocoons, silkworm eggs, or mulberry seedlings. They believe that China is currently unable to use dry cocoons economically. The Chinese government only hopes to prevent Japan from processing dry cocoons into raw silk and selling them abroad. The Guardian concludes that the economic competition between China and Japan seems to have begun again, but Japan will still be in the lead.

Japanese Businessmen Optimistic About Economic Future

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 26th] Japanese Minister of Commerce and Industry Hoshijima told many Japanese financiers yesterday that Japan's economic situation is optimistic. Coal production in the second half of the year can reach 30 million tons, and the spinning industry is proceeding according to plan, with sufficient cotton supply for each textile factory. Banks have been removed from the reparations list, so they can operate soon. Although the reparations issue is still there, the work of the economic sector has been completed, and the whole country will be united again when the peace conference is held in the future.

### Diligent and People-Oriented: The Mayor's Inspection Tour - Spot Check on Household Registration - Visiting and Comforting Brothels Without Fear - Deeply Moved by the Wide Gap Between Rich and Poor Citizens

[Our Report] Yesterday morning, a light rain drizzled, and the weather was dreary.

The atmosphere in the Guizhou Road Old Zhabei Branch, Second District Public Office, was more lively than usual, with all the staff excited and enthusiastic. The sole catalyst was the news of the mayor's upcoming on-site investigation. They weren't trying to "curry favor with the superiors," but after a long period of hard work, who wouldn't feel a bit of joy at the prospect of being favored by their superiors?

In the district head's office, Deputy District Heads Li Ruchun and Wang Chengxiong waited expectantly. For a month, they had been hoping for Mayor Wu's visit. Time passed by minute by minute, cigarettes were extinguished and relit, but Mayor Wu had not yet arrived. The mayor was originally scheduled to inspect the Second District first at 8:30 a.m., then the Eleventh District. Moreover, he was usually punctual, so today's exception inevitably raised concerns. Fortunately, this uncertainty was dispelled by the sound of a car horn. Mayor Wu stepped out of the car with a smile and said, "I went to the Xincheng District for inspection first."

Then, Mayor Wu said, "District Head, please accompany me to the most densely populated and decorated areas. I want to conduct a spot check on household registrations!"

An Elderly Man Bows and Scrapes, Repeatedly Calling Him "Good Mayor"

"Tap, tap, tap!" Mayor Wu chose No. 4 Hongxing Lane, Beijing East Road, knocking on the back door and asking, "We're here to check household registrations. Is anyone home?" This was an old-fashioned lane house, two stories up and two stories down. It was dark inside, and the light didn't seem to be very good. A sign that said "Yongli Yarn Weaving Factory Office" hung at the front door, already peeling. There was no sign of office work inside, just a few workers in short shirts reading newspapers. There were also a few children who were just learning to talk, crawling on the ground. When they saw a large group of strangers approaching, they opened their small eyes wide and shouted, "Papa!..."

The head of the household, Zhou Xiangbing, had already gone out. Mayor Wu patiently explained the situation to an employee and said, "Don't look at the household registration card yet. Try to tell me the names of the family members, and I'll check if they're correct." So, the employee looked up at the sky, bent his fingers, and recited, "Eldest, second, third,..."

Just then, the tenant couple living upstairs heard the noise and rushed down. The gentleman was in his late forties, with graying temples. He held the household registration card in his hand and ran excitedly to the mayor, first presenting the household registration card with both hands, then introducing himself, "I am Huang Shitao, this is my wife." Then he bowed and scraped, finally shaking hands warmly, and saying in an excited tone, "Good Mayor! You are truly a mayor of the people!"

Bank Delays Reporting, Mayor Kindly Admonishes

Mayor Wu, because he had received information that the Bachuan Bank (corner of Yunnan Road and Guizhou Road) was deliberately delaying household registration reports, decided to personally inspect and persuade the Bachuan Bank. He said, "The reason I want to inspect the district offices is to urge the staff to serve diligently and to awaken the citizens' attention and cooperation in household registration reporting."

When the Bachuan Bank's employee reported to the manager's office, Mayor Wu naturally received a warmer reception than he would have in an ordinary home. General Manager Liu Xiwen served tea and water for a long time. Mayor Wu said repeatedly, "You don't have to be so polite. I'm here specifically to check household registrations. Please bring out the household registration card." After a while, an employee did as he was told, but what he brought out was a survey form, not a household registration card. It turned out that Bachuan Bank had not reported its household registration to this day. It is said that the district office had politely persuaded them three times, but each time they were refused.

However, Mayor Wu still politely said to the general manager, "Today, as a result of spot checks of household registrations in various districts, I found that the common people are very good, but large commercial firms are more difficult to promote. I heard that this place has not reported three times..." Before Mayor Wu finished speaking, General Manager Liu expressed his deep apologies and promised to comply immediately. Then there was a burst of laughter, and everyone was happy.

Difficulties at the Brothel, Unfamiliar with the Distinguished Guest

The Fifth Bao of the Second District has one particular feature—there are a lot of brothels. Because the population has a large turnover, although Bao Chief Hu Baorong tried his best, he still encountered unexpected difficulties in handling household registration work. So, Mayor Wu's last program today was to conduct a spot check of brothels.

No. 9 Fuyu Lane, Yunnan Middle Road, had a "book house" lantern hanging at the door as usual. It was a three-story, half-new, half-old residence. The interior was very spacious, housing a total of seven households, six of which were licensed prostitutes. Usually, these brothels were commonly known as "Changsan Tangzi," which were originally high-end places for prostitution. Because it was morning, the house was dark and messy. Directly facing the door was the living room, with relatively old and cluttered furnishings. The rooms on both sides were places to receive guests, with full sets of mahogany furniture, like the most luxurious bedrooms. At this time, those who stayed in the room were middle-aged women. They were each working, some ironing clothes, some turning silk batting, some cooking, some combing their hair...

Naturally, they didn't recognize the mayor, and they would never have thought that one day, the mayor would suddenly come. The head of the household, Zhao Huiying, opened her sleepy eyes, buttoning the buttons on her clothes, and walked out of the back room. She looked at this group of uninvited guests with surprised and frightened eyes. The mayor explained kindly, "We are here to check household registrations, but we will never make things difficult for you, and we will never punish you. You can just say it boldly, don't be alarmed."

She was nearly forty years old and was the head of the selected area, also known as the "old madam." She had six or seven girls under her, named: Sister Xia, Li Zhenzhen, Young Brother Yang, Shi Nuannuan... At this time, a girl of twenty-one, fashionably dressed, walked in through the door. Knowing that they were checking household registrations, she introduced herself as Li Eryuan, twenty-one years old, and in charge of the Hongzhu Book House here. Mayor Wu then asked her, "How many people are in your household? Tell me their names." The girl replied coyly, "You want me to say their names, I really can't say them, because we usually call them 'Auntie' and 'Uncle.'" It was a soft Suzhou dialect. Mayor Wu had no choice but to see that it was generally not too far off, and instructed them that in the future, if there were any population changes, they must fill out and report their household registrations at any time, and that was it.

Nine Households Living in a Pigeon Cage, Feeling Unequal

After spot-checking a few places, the time was nearing noon. The light rain continued to fall, and the road surface was still muddy. So bumpy, Mayor Wu said with emotion, "The destruction of the enemy and puppet regime is really hateful. Now that several main roads have been repaired, we will immediately start repairing the small roads."

Next, Mayor Wu said to reporters, "After a half-day of inspection, I feel very satisfied with the household registration work of the district office. On the other hand, the environmental sanitation is really too poor. For example, garbage and fruit peels are thrown all over the street. Naturally, this is also due to the dense population and the reality that hawkers cannot be banned as scheduled, so we can only gradually seek improvement."

Finally, Mayor Wu expressed his deep emotion. Because he saw in Xincheng District that nine families lived in a pigeon cage-like small house, the crowding and filth were unimaginable. He said, "The Chinese are really too unequal. The rich are too rich, and the poor are too poor!"

### More Than 400 Businesses Willing - To Reduce or Exempt Two Types of Income Tax - The Direct Taxation Bureau Explains and Answers Point by Point

[Our Report] Yesterday morning at around 9:00 a.m., more than 400 businesses on Nanjing Road sent representatives, including Liu Xiexun and five others, to the Shanghai Direct Taxation Bureau to petition for a reduction or exemption from the salary income tax and securities deposit income tax. The responsible persons of the bureau, Lou Guowei, Bangban Ge Yanshao, and Section Chief Yu Xianda, received them and explained in detail the significance of the tax levies.

It is reported that the reasons for the request to reduce or exempt the income tax on salaries and remuneration from the various businesses are as follows: (1) Since January of this year, some personnel from various businesses have left their jobs, and the businesses themselves have no way to withhold taxes on their behalf. (2) The new income tax rates announced by the Ministry of Finance on April 16 are quite high. Withholding the full amount will affect the lives and work morale of the employees. The replies from the Direct Taxation Bureau are as follows: (1) Those who have left their jobs may be exempted from withholding. (2) The income tax on salaries and remuneration for on-the-job employees from August will be paid in accordance with the new tax law from that day forward. As for the taxes before August, they will be withheld in installments. Detailed installment methods will be handled later.

Regarding the income tax on securities deposits, the reasons for the request for reduction or exemption from the various businesses are also two points: (1) At present, most businesses rely on high-interest loans to maintain themselves. If the income tax of the lenders is withheld, it will affect the source of loans for the businesses. (2) Some creditor and debtor relationships have already been settled and cannot be withheld. The reply from the Taxation Bureau is: (1) For debts that have not been settled, the interest payable will be calculated according to the deposit interest rate of the money industry and used as the standard for withholding tax, not according to the black market interest rate. However, this point is the method suggested by the Shanghai Direct Taxation Bureau and must be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval before it can be implemented. (2) For debts that have been settled, the businesses will copy the names of the depositors and send them to the Taxation Bureau.

Finally, the Taxation Bureau advised the representatives of the various businesses, saying that the country is currently experiencing financial difficulties, and paying taxes is the glorious duty of citizens. They also asked the representatives to assist more in the promotion of tax policies, and promised that the difficulties of merchants and civilians would be taken into account at any time and reported to the higher authorities for approval. The representatives stated that they would immediately inform their counterparts and then withdrew.

### Tea Industry Petition Group - Demands Government Purchase

This year's export of new tea has almost stalled because the exchange rate has failed to keep pace with prices. Tea producers are unable to sell due to excessive losses, and some export brokers are taking the opportunity to suppress prices and profit. Representatives from various tea regions have gathered in Shanghai to organize a petition, requesting the government to follow the precedent of purchasing silkworms and carry out purchases. This matter concerns the country's economic lifeline and the livelihoods of millions of tea industry farmers and workers. If the decision is delayed any further, the entire tea industry will inevitably collapse, and export brokers will be allowed to cut prices and slaughter them, which is worrying.

### Qingdao Municipal Council Calls - For the Transfer of Two Tax Revenues to the Local Level

### This Year's Municipal Financial Tax Revenue

Will Still Be Implemented According to the Decision of the Council

Since the new tax law was passed by the Legislative Yuan recently, it stipulates that the tax rates for house rent, entertainment tax, banquet tax, and business license tax should all be lower than the current collection amount. The reporter yesterday went to the Finance Bureau to inquire about how the tax revenue in this city should be handled in the future and whether the new tax law should be followed. According to the person in charge, the tax revenue methods and tax rates implemented in this city are all resolved by the Municipal Council and submitted for implementation. The Municipal Council is the people's representative body. It has been explained in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings that for local politics, the decisions of the local autonomous body should be the principle, and the orders of the central government are only for reference. Moreover, this new tax law has not yet been approved by the Supreme National Defense Council, and there is no clear order to Shanghai, so all tax revenues this year should still be implemented according to the decision of the Municipal Council in order to comply with public opinion and meet local conditions. Furthermore, although the theory of the new tax law passed by the Legislative Yuan is good, it may not be completely in line with the actual situation in various places. For example, the house rent regulations of the Legislative Yuan stipulate that those who live in one room alone or with one or more people can be exempt from tax. In Shanghai, where there are many people and few houses, such a situation accounts for 90 percent. If it can be exempt from tax, then the collection of house rent tax will become a problem. Other taxes also differ greatly from the original regulations in this city. If they are all implemented, the income and expenditure of the Municipal Government will be greatly affected. Therefore, Director Gu has already gone to Nanjing to explain to the relevant authorities of the central government and ask them to reconsider so as to meet local conditions.

### Powell of the China Weekly Review Talks About - Today's Hong Kong - Replaced the Old Shanghai Concessions

[Our Report] Before the war, the English-language China Weekly Review was edited by JB Powell, whose sharp writing style and unrelenting attacks on forgery and criticism were very popular with readers at home and abroad. When the Pacific War broke out, Powell refused to evacuate Shanghai in advance, and was detained by enemy troops in a concentration camp, where he suffered greatly. The toes of both feet were frozen and had to be amputated by a doctor. After the victory, Powell originally planned to come to Shanghai to meet his old friends whom he had not seen for many years, taking advantage of the convenience of testifying at the Tokyo International Military Tribunal. Unexpectedly, he fell ill with heart disease in Japan and hurriedly returned to the United States for treatment, and the trip to Shanghai was cancelled. The China Weekly Review is now continued by his son, JW Powell. After a year of hard work, it is said that the sales volume has exceeded that before the war. The China Biographical Dictionary (Who in China), which is published by the company every year, has also resumed editing work. It is said that the first post-war volume will be published in March next year.

WJ Powell recently traveled to Hong Kong and told reporters yesterday that the general situation in Hong Kong is better than that in Shanghai, and food and clothing prices are cheaper than in Shanghai. However, the housing shortage is also quite serious, and the practice of key money and deposits is also prevalent. At present, the largest number of people in Hong Kong are various "refugees" who have come from East and South China. They take Hong Kong as a haven for escape, either for political reasons or for other economic purposes. Therefore, today's Hong Kong has actually replaced the old Shanghai concessions. New banks and money shops can be seen on the streets every day, with piles of flower baskets at the door. However, after they open, they do not actually engage in formal operations, because their purpose is only to cover up the escape of domestic funds. Powell also said that his father, JB Powell, is currently recuperating in a hospital in Washington. He very much hopes to return to China next spring. His health has improved greatly compared to when he was in Japan.

The results of the investigation showed that they had all received them. When inspecting Zhangjia Garden, he saw that the residents were also dumping garbage outside the garbage bins on the roadside.

### Cracking Down on a Counterfeit Currency Operation; Thirteen Arrested in Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Chongming; Over Eight Million Yuan in Counterfeit Bills Seized

[Our Newspaper's Report] The police bureau recently cracked a counterfeit currency operation that was printing Central Bank notes with a face value of 2,000 yuan. Twelve suspects have been arrested in Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Chongming. Over four thousand and fifty-one counterfeit bills that have been printed were seized with a total face value of eight million one hundred thousand two thousand yuan, along with a set of counterfeit copper molds buried in the fields. The case was concluded yesterday after interrogation, and all were transferred to the local court for handling.

It is reported that two youths, Zhou Mulian (27 years old, from Nanjing) and Jiang Renlan (21 years old, from Zhuji), being unemployed for a long time, had a bizarre idea in June of this year and raised over five million yuan to plan to counterfeit legal tender. They first entrusted a friend in Shanghai to contact the Yixin Plate Making Company at No. 26 North Sea Road to create a counterfeit 2,000 yuan currency plate. Then, they took it to No. 14 Yingbai Road in Hangzhou to start trial printing. However, the first batch was too blurred to be used.

On the 12th, Detective Captain Li Junhou led officers Ren Gongxia, Chen Jinsheng, and employee Chen Xianrong, along with police officer Xu Shutian, to the police dog training center at No. 645 Hejian Road. Zhang Yaoting was out and had not returned. Only one million yuan worth of counterfeit currency was found in Zhou Ji's bed in his dormitory. Zhou Ji was arrested. People in the center said that Zhang had not returned for two days, but his friends Zhou Mulian and Jiang Renlan were living there and might be involved in the case. Therefore, the two were also taken to the bureau. At that time, police officers waiting at No. 645 Songyuan Road had also arrested Zhang Yaoting. After interrogation, all the suspects confessed to printing and selling counterfeit currency. They also stated that the printing press was located at No. 14 Yingbai Road in Hangzhou and that all the counterfeit currency had been taken to Shanghai. About six million yuan was hidden in the home of Gu Xiongkui at No. 201 Guangxi Road. Hu Cuosheng introduced the photography copper plate. So Hu was arrested at No. 92 Alley 2, Anli Lane, Wusong Road, on the afternoon of the 19th. Based on Hu's confession, on the 21st, officer Chen Jinshan and police officer Xu Youyi were sent to arrest Wang Zhichong, a photographer, in Shigou Township, Baisha Village, Chongming Island.

### Indictment of the Grain Loan Case; Full Text Published Yesterday; Collusion Between Officials and Merchants; Triggered a Wild Surge in Staple Food Prices; Eight Defendants Have Strong Suspicions of Criminal Activity

[Our Newspaper's Report] The grain loan embezzlement case first came to light in May of this year and was initially handled by the military law of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. However, because the case was significant, involving many officials and merchants, it attracted attention from all sides. As a result, whether the case should be tried by the judiciary or by military law was debated for months. On October 17th, the order was given to transfer the case to the local procuratorate for investigation in accordance with judicial procedures. Now, after more than a month of investigation by prosecutor Wu Qihua, the case has been completed. Among the ten defendants, Yang Xinian and Li Chongnian were found to have insufficient evidence of guilt and were given a non-prosecution decision. The other eight people, including Wang Daren, have been prosecuted according to law. The full text of the indictment is published below:

Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Indictment, 35th Year, Qi Zi No. 7002. Defendant Wang Xunzhi, male, 47 years old, from Hangzhou, residing at No. 55 Siming Village, Fuxu Road, Deputy General Manager of Changjiang Company, Manager of Housheng Company. Zhuang Hanzhang, male, 52 years old, from Shanghai, residing at No. 365 Zhongzheng East Road, Business Director of Changjiang Company. Wu Rongsheng, male, 47 years old, from Pinghu, residing at No. 370 Ximen Road, Manager of Santai Grain Store. Wan Molin, male, 45 years old, from Pudong, residing at No. 2, Alley 230, Huageguo Road, Manager of Wanchang Rice Store, Chairman of the Bean and Rice Trade Association. Xing Zhigang, male, 57 years old, from Shanghai, residing at No. 8, Alley 466, Henan Road, Manager of Chengfeng Rice Store. Yang Runhui, male, 41 years old, from Nanhui, residing at No. 94 Lin'an Road, Manager of Wanchang Xin Rice Store. Wang Daren, male, 41 years old, from Shanghai, residing at No. 19, Alley 186, Ya'erpei Road, Specialist of the Ministry of Food, Acting Director of the Shanghai Food Administration. Ren Xingya, male, 33 years old, from Yixing, residing at No. 53 Duolun Road, Head of the Adjustment Section of the Shanghai Food Administration.

The above-named defendants are suspected of violating the Regulations for the Management of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce During the Emergency Period, etc. (35th Year, Zhen Jia Zi No. 2443, 4716). The investigation has been completed and it is deemed that prosecution should be initiated. The criminal facts, evidence, and violated legal provisions are listed below:

In February of this year, the Shanghai Municipal Government convened a meeting of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Provisional Council, and the heads of various agencies to discuss general issues. Those attending the meeting unanimously suggested that the government implement grain loans. Because Shanghai had been occupied for many years, the grain trade was controlled by the enemy. The original large-scale, reputable grain merchant organizations were destroyed. At the beginning of the restoration, the citizens' food supply relied entirely on small merchants and peddlers purchasing and transporting supplies from nearby areas. There was no storage. Later, prices, grain prices, wages, and freight rates rose successively. Merchants and peddlers had limited capital, making it difficult to turn over and purchase goods. The quantity was reduced, and there was a deep fear that the inventory was too low and it would be difficult to maintain the supply during the lean season. The Ministry of Food wanted to support grain merchants to strengthen their power and enable them to bear the responsibility of supplying the people's food. Therefore, it ordered the Shanghai Food Administration Commissioner's Office to consult with the China Farmers Bank (later changed to the China Bank to provide loans) to devise appropriate measures. By April 1st, various parties were urging for prompt action. Minister of Food Xu Kan came to Shanghai to hold a meeting and personally supervised Wang Daren, a specialist from the Shanghai Food Administration, and Li Chongnian, the Director of the Land Tax Department of the Ministry of Food, to discuss and draft the "Shanghai Grain Merchant Loan Measures." Wang Daren and Ren Xingya colluded with Wan Molin, Chairman of the Shanghai Bean and Rice Trade Association, to relax the qualifications of loan merchants and pre-select a list of loan merchants. On April 3rd, the list was submitted to the review. The Xiaozu Committee, Weijiang Company, Santai Rice Store, Wanchang Rice Store, Wanchang Xin Rice Store, and others were all approved smoothly. All the lists of loan merchants and the amount of loans were:

Changjiang Company Wang Xunzhi 60 million yuan

Santai Rice Store Wu Rongsheng 60 million yuan

Wanchang Rice Store Wan Molin 60 million yuan

Wanchang Xin Rice Store Yang Runhui 60 million yuan

Xinchang Rice Store Zhu Yongming 60 million yuan

Yongshuntai Rice Store Gu Yisheng 60 million yuan

Tongcheng Company Fu Changyu 60 million yuan

Xiedaheng Rice Store Feng Yongsheng 60 million yuan

Qianchangyu Rice Store Yu Liangji 60 million yuan

Hengtaifeng Rice Store Zhang [missing character] Chao 60 million yuan

Guangye Company Jin Zhifeng 60 million yuan

(Because procedures were not completed, the loan was not obtained)

Zhi Feng Rice Store Xu Taiyuan 60 million yuan

Xiechangtai Rice Store Zhu Shilu 60 million yuan

Hui Feng Company Wang Yuzhen 60 million yuan

Tong Yi Company Lu Linxun 60 million yuan

Jiangbei Company Xing Songwen 60 million yuan

Fu Kang Rice Store Shao Jigao 40 million yuan

### Food Officials Allow Grain Merchants to Hoard; Rice Prices Soar; Public Resentment Boils Over

Except that Guangye Company did not obtain a loan due to incomplete procedures and the other thirteen Xinchang Rice Store, etc., there is no criminal evidence. Wang Xunzhi and Zhuang Hanzhang of Changjiang Company, Wu Rongsheng of Santai Rice Store, and Wan Molin of Wanchang Rice Store used this opportunity to hoard rice, monopolize the rice market, and manipulate the rice market. Xing Zhigang, the executive director of the Bean and Rice Trade Association, failed to apply for a loan and intended to expose the secrets of the grain loan. Wan Molin could not make amends, so he transferred the rice funds obtained by Wanchang Xin Rice Store to Xing Zhigang without the approval of the competent authorities after reaching an agreement with Yang Runyou. Wang Daren and Ren Xingya passively did not interfere, causing Shanghai rice prices to rise suddenly during the loan period. Within a few days, rice prices soared, exceeding 30,000 yuan, which caught the attention of both domestic and foreign parties, and public resentment boiled over. Cheng Zhonghang, the supervisor of the Jiangsu Supervisory District of the Control Yuan, ordered section chiefs and investigators to thoroughly investigate the truth from the Food Administration, the Bean and Rice Trade Association, and the companies and firms that received the grain loans. He believed that Yang Xizhi, the special commissioner of the Shanghai Food Administration, Wang Daren, a specialist of the Food Administration acting as the director, Ren Xingya, the head of the Adjustment Section, and Li Chongnian, the director of the Land Tax Department of the Ministry of Food, had all violated the law and were derelict in their duties. He submitted an impeachment to the Executive Yuan, involving criminal elements, and requested the hospital to investigate. According to the investigation department in June this year, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters also found that Wang Xunzhi of Changjiang Company and Zhuang Hanzhang, the business director of the company, and Wu Rongsheng of Thirty-Tai Rice Store were suspected of hoarding grain for profit. They were all arrested and transferred to the court with the file on October 17 of this year.

### Wang Xunzhi: Packaging and On-line, Deliberately Manipulating

Defendant Wang Xunzhi is currently the Deputy General Manager of Changjiang Company and the Manager of Housheng Company. Because he served as the Deputy Director of the National Treasury Department of the Ministry of Finance and the Director of the Zhejiang Monopoly Bureau, he had personal relationships with the current food administration staff. In addition to borrowing 150 million yuan in grain funds from Zhejiang in the name of Housheng Company, he also borrowed 60 million yuan in grain funds in the name of Changjiang Company at the beginning of the grain loan in this city. After receiving the loan on April 14th, he went to [missing character] Wuhu and other places to purchase and transport grain. On April 24th, his first shipment of grain from Fengjing, totaling 351 and a half dan, had arrived in Shanghai. Rice prices were rising. In order to hoard and speculate, the defendant delayed selling it on the market and stored the incoming grain. By May 14th, there was a total of 1,847 and a half stones of stored grain. Only 696 stones were sold after being urged to sell. His actions not only violated Article 13 of the Grain Loan Measures, but also showed speculative and manipulative behavior. He should be severely punished in accordance with Article 31 of the Regulations for the Management of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce During the Emergency Period. Although the defendant repeatedly argued: On April 24th, 351 and a half stones of rice arrived. I filled out a form and reported to the Food Administration. I didn't receive a notice of approval to sell until the 26th. Unexpectedly, the market became chaotic on the 27th and the rice was not sold. The defense wants to know that the defendant has good relations with the current food administration staff, so he can borrow a large amount of grain funds in both Jiangsu and Zhejiang. How could it be that he was not allowed to sell immediately after the grain arrived on April 24th? Even stepping back, the defendant should have filled out a form and reported it on the same day when the grain arrived on April 24th, and he could have sold it on the market on the 25th. Why did he receive the approval notice on the 26th? It is clearly a fabricated excuse and not credible. Instead of selling it as soon as it arrived, he wanted to pack it, sew the bags, transport it to the warehouse, etc., in preparation for hoarding, which is highly suspected of deliberately manipulating rice prices. In addition to the competent authority confiscating his hoarded goods in accordance with Article 18 of the Emergency Regulations for the Supervision and Restriction of Daily Necessities [missing characters] Hoarding, the defendant's evidence of the crime is very clear, and he should be severely punished. Defendant Zhuang Han [missing character] is the business director of Changjiang Company. He must be responsible for the purchase and sale. Now he is hoarding together, placing the immediate sale approved by the Adjustment Section in disregard of the responsibility of helping to violate Article 31 of the Regulations for the Management of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce During the Emergency Period.

### Wu Rongsheng of Santai Rice Store Sells Public Rice to Rice Dealers for Personal Gain

On April 29th, Wu Rongsheng of Santai Rice Store, the Food Administration authority, thought there would be a storm because Yi [missing character] Company sold rice at a low price, causing a storm, The Administration requested to report to Chief Song of the Executive Yuan, decided to stop selling loan merchants' rice, and at the same time, ordered the Shanghai Food Administration to allocate 30,000 stones of rice under the military food item for restoring trading the market and food use in order to stabilise [missing character] rice, Wu Rongsheng of Santai Rice Store, Feng Yongsheng of Xie Daheng Rice Store to sell the International Rice Factory's white rice to the market on each of the firm’s names, from April 29th to May 9th, a total of 11,000 packages of rice were transferred to Santai Rice Store, This is an emergency measure. The defendant should be conscientious, law-abiding and sell public rice to rice dealers to achieve real sales and stabilize people’s confidence, but in contrast, Wu Rongsheng sold 1,193 packs totaling 1,407 stones to the peers, so although the rice was sold, it was actually still kept in the rice stores, which violated the market regulations. It is obvious that it is monopolizing and manipulating the rice market, The defendant’s actions have violated Article 31 of the Regulations for the Management of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce During the Emergency Period.

### Wan Molin - Part

The defendant, Wan Molin, is the chairman of the Bean and Rice Trade Association. The rice shops he operates include Wan Chang, Wan Chang Xin, and a portion of San Tai Rice Shop. All three of these rice shops have been listed for grain loans without exception, indicating that from the beginning, he had the intention of seizing grain loan benefits based on his special position. Now, after the grain and rice arrived in Shanghai, there are records in his Wan Chang Rice Shop's sales diary of selling rice to Wan Chang Rice Shop. This is clearly a false sale, but in reality, he still controls it to achieve the purpose of hoarding and speculation. It is calculated that 50 shi were sold to Wan Chang Rice Shop on April 23, 225 shi on May 17, and 65 shi were allocated to Wan Chang on April 28, and 317 shi, 7 dou, 7 sheng, and 9 ge on May 15, totaling 657 shi, 7 dou, 7 sheng, and 9 ge. Furthermore, the defendant reported the total amount of grain received to the Grain Administration Office as 1,952 shi and 8 dou, which is 50 shi less than the quantity of goods purchased. The total amount of grain sold was 1,322 shi and 8 dou, which is a discrepancy of 630 shi compared to the previous total sales amount, which creates a strong suspicion of hoarding. He should also be punished appropriately in accordance with Article 31 of the Regulations on the Administration of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce during Extraordinary Periods.

### Xing Zhigang Obtains Loans by Impersonating Wan Chang Xin

The defendant, Xing Zhigang, was eliminated by the Grain Loan Review Committee because he failed to deliver the required amount of military grain. Later, he colluded with Yang Run and Wan Molin to obtain loans by impersonating Wan Chang Xin, which is not the behavior of a legitimate businessman. It is verified that he is suspected of violating Article 339, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. The defendant, Yang Run, is the manager of Wan Chang Xin, and Wan Molin is the owner of Wan Chang Xin. Without the approval of the competent authorities, they transferred the 60 million yuan in rice funds obtained by Wan Chang Xin to Xing Zhigang. They have confessed this fact during the investigation. Therefore, the defendant, with the intention to help others commit crimes, and his actions constituting the elements of a crime, should be recognized as joint principals in the aforementioned crime and should also be sentenced to appropriate penalties.

It is found that Yang Xizhi, a special commissioner of the Grain Administration Office, flew to the United States by plane on March 14 of this year. During his assignment to attend international conferences, the defendant, Wang Daren, a key official actually responsible for grain administration in Shanghai, colluded with Wan Molin, the chairman of the Bean and Rice Trade Association, to introduce Wang Xunzhi of the Yangtze River Company as a grain loan borrower. However, that company hoarded and monopolized the market. Wang Xunzhi, Wu Rongsheng, and the defendant are old friends. The defendant's position was the person in charge of grain administration in Shanghai, and he had a legal obligation to prevent such actions, and he was able to prevent them but did not do so, allowing merchants to hoard, causing food prices to soar. His passive behavior assisted Wang Xunzhi and others in committing crimes and is inexcusable. He should be held responsible for assisting others in violating Article 31 of the Regulations on the Administration of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce during Extraordinary Periods and should be punished in accordance with Article 15 and Articles 3 and 134 of the same law.

### Grain Prices Soar; Ren Xingya Should Be Held Responsible

The defendant, Ren Xingya, is the section chief of the Adjustment Section of the Grain Administration Office. Regulating the people's food supply and controlling rice and grain are his responsibilities. Now, during the period when grain loans were being offered, rice prices should have decreased due to the smooth supply of grain merchants, but instead, they rose sharply, which was obviously caused by unscrupulous merchants manipulating the market and traders hoarding goods. The hoarding and speculation of the Yangtze River Company and San Tai Rice Shop have been described above. The Adjustment Section, which is in charge, has a legal obligation to prevent such actions, but it was allowed to happen without intervention. Even if it cannot be proven that they colluded for profit and assisted others in monopolizing and manipulating the market, they should still be held responsible for assisting in violating Article 31 of the Regulations on the Administration of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce. Please impose punishment in accordance with Articles 15, 30, and 134 of the Criminal Law.

In summary, the above-mentioned defendants are suspected of committing serious crimes and should be punished according to the law. Except for the defendants Yang Xizhi and Li Chongnian, whose crimes are insufficient, and the loan merchant Zhu Yongming and others, who lack evidence of crimes, they should be dismissed separately. In accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a public prosecution is hereby initiated. Addressed to the Criminal Division of this court, Wu Qihua, Prosecutor of the Shanghai District Court. November 23, Year 35 of the Republic of China.

### Swiss National, Weitler, Accused of Espionage; High Court Holds Preliminary Hearing Yesterday; Inquiry Regarding Codes; Claims They Were Used For Roulette; Insists They Were Purchased From Montreal; Extensively Discusses Gambling Experience In Court

[Report from this Newspaper] Swiss national Eily Widler, 58 years old, was recently accused by Eddie Lee of the Songhu Garrison Command of counterfeiting American currency and stamps, selling copper to the Japanese, obtaining a pass from the Japanese military, and working as a spy. Wei was immediately detained by the command and sent to the Shanghai High Court Procuratorate for handling. After the investigation was completed, a public prosecution was filed on October 26. The indictment stated that Wei had been acting as a spy for the enemy's navy and military police, specializing in taking photographs that benefited the enemy and engaging in secret communications. In the 30th year of the Republic of China, he conspired with the Japanese to steal purple copper and other materials stored in Shanghai by the American Trabing Company on behalf of the Chinese Central Mint to support the enemy. Although the defendant cunningly denied being a spy, the file contained special permits for navigation and travel issued to the defendant by the Special Service Squad of the Japanese Shanghai Naval Landing Forces, the Headquarters of the Third Fleet, the Shanghai Military Police Headquarters, and Oomura Hanabusa of the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy, as well as the Mikimoto code, which clearly violated Articles 2, Paragraph 1, Items 4 and 7 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors. In accordance with Article 1 of the Special Criminal Cases Procedure Law and Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a public prosecution is hereby initiated.

The case was initially heard by the High Court yesterday afternoon.

All the property of the two criminals, except for the necessary living expenses for their families, will be confiscated according to law.

Wu Yonghua, a native of Nantong, previously opened Lihua Auto Hardware Store in Shanghai, selling auto parts and hardware. After the victory, someone reported that Wu served as the chairman of the Puppet Automobile Dismantling Parts Industry Association in September of the 31st year of the Republic, using his position to search for motorcycles and hardware for the enemy military, and reselling automobile engines at high prices to the enemy for the purpose of manufacturing suicide fleets. Before the enemy surrendered, there were still 300 vehicles ordered to be sold to the factory, but due to the end of the war, the goods had not yet been delivered. The Songhu Garrison Command Investigation Office detained and sent him to the High Court. The case was debated to a conclusion yesterday morning, and the sentence is scheduled to be announced on the morning of December 3.

### Investigation of Four Cases

[Report from this Newspaper] The High Court opened a hearing yesterday to investigate several cases of suspected traitors: (1)

Fan Cunzheng

Twenty-eight years old. He was picked up by the Shanghai County Provisional Council, who pointed out that he had served as a secret agent for the enemy's military police and as an instructor in the Puppet Beiqiao District Office. The defendant denied that he had served as an enemy secret agent, but admitted that he had served as an instructor in the puppet Baobaojia system, but claimed that he had joined the Martin Action Team under orders to cover underground workers. He was full of patriotic and anti-Japanese words. He also claimed that the reason he was reported this time was because he refused to accept a bribe from Section Chief Li of the County Government, which led to a conflict. Huang Yunshang, the Speaker of the Provisional Council, stated in court that someone had informed the Provisional Council, so he filed a report, which was the consensus of the Council. After the interrogation, the defendant cupped his hands to the informant and said, "Thank you, sir, for giving me a lesson by coming here." The informant nodded yes, yes. (2) Heng'an Shipyard Manager

Zheng Liangbin

He was accused of serving as a Foreign Affairs Committee member of the Puppet Central Political Committee and as a standing director and ship department director of the Chinese Shipping Company jointly operated by the enemy and puppets. The defendant denied that he had worked for the enemy in shipbuilding and other matters. (3)

Wang Zhen

Accused of serving as a translator for the enemy military police in Pudong, the captain of the Pudong Detective Team, the chief of the Dongchang Road Police Station, and the chief of the Yangjing Branch Bureau. The defendant denied assisting the enemy, and investigations revealed that all were in favor of the defendant. (4)

White Russian

Pan Lin Alexander was accused of working in the enemy military police and engaging in activities detrimental to our country. The defendant denied this. The above cases were all adjourned for further questioning about the industrial property in the camp. The court showed him a newspaper report that indicated he had colluded with the enemy. Wei read it and said that this was

Deliberate Slander

In the hope of obtaining property, because I live in a house that occupies 25 mu of land, which is wide and beautiful. The court then asked: "In the 26th and 27th years of the Republic of China, you won the first prize in horse racing and bought a yacht to travel. You encountered a hurricane outside the Wusongkou and it sank. Fortunately, you were rescued by the Japanese and went to live in Japan for more than half a year?" Wei replied: "Apart from winning the first prize, the rest is fictional." When asked about the theft of purple copper stored in Shanghai by the American Mosheng Company on behalf of the Central Mint, Wei replied: "This was sold to the Japanese by Mosheng Company, and there is a letter from Mosheng to prove it. It happened between the 29th and 30th years of the Republic. At that time, the total value was 4 million legal tender, and I received a commission of 200,000 yuan, but it was obtained from the American company. The 4 million yuan obtained from the sale was

Mosheng Company

Entrusted the Shanghai Youli Bank to remit the money to the New York headquarters. Later, I heard that Mosheng remitted the money to the Chinese government in the 30th year of the Republic, but the amount is unknown." The court immediately said, "The Central Mint has sent a letter to the Inspection Office of the Songhu Garrison Command, stating that it has not received the money." Wei replied, "This has nothing to do with me." Then, he was asked about obtaining a special pass from the enemy military and acting as a spy. Wei replied, "At that time, foreigners in the occupied areas could obtain this permit. Although I was allowed to take news photos, I never actually took any." The court then asked what the three codebooks were for. Wei said, "This is not a code, but the numbers for Western roulette. It was published by Monte Carlo City in Europe and purchased by mail for personal

Game Entertainment

I used it to study which number I could hit, but I have not yet completed this work." After speaking, he explained in detail how to use it for games and gambling. He also said: "To regard this as a code is to be ignorant." After the interrogation came to an end, Wei stated to the court that when he was arrested, two gold watches, two gold rings, one gold bar, 5,000 US dollars, and a car were taken away, and the office was sealed and occupied. The Garrison Command has destroyed my reputation. At first, I was accused of counterfeiting American currency, but after investigation, there was no evidence, and now I am accused of espionage," and requested that he be released. The court replied, "You need to submit a written application for bail, and the collegiate bench will evaluate and decide. You can be released very quickly." After speaking, he ordered a further hearing. After Wei spoke with his family, he was escorted back to prison by bailiffs.

### Reader Consultations - Legal Questions

(Violation of Will)

Wang Li asks: There are two brothers, Jia and Yi. Jia is the son of the first wife, and Yi is the son of the stepmother. When their father was alive, he allocated a portion of the property as alimony for the stepmother (as stated in the will), but after their father died, Jia overturned the will and refused to be responsible for supporting the stepmother. What should be done legally in this matter?

[Lawyer Cao Yaxia's Answer] (1) The property designated for alimony should be used by the person receiving alimony to enjoy the right to alimony from that property; (2) Jia and Yi should each bear the obligation of support according to their economic capacity.

I plan to recover the old debt from him, but the current value of the currency is vastly different from that at the time. How should it be converted to be reasonable?

[Lawyer Cao Yaxia's Answer] It cannot be calculated based on the cost of living index. It can only be done in accordance with Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations on Handling Civil Litigation after Restoration: After a legal act is established, if the circumstances change due to reasons not attributable to the parties, which could not have been foreseen in ordinary times, and the original effect is obviously unfair, the court may be requested to make a fair judgment to increase the payment.

(3) The apprentice died in the shop in this city, but the family of the deceased lives in Suzhou. Can the case be filed directly with the Suzhou High Court without going through the courts here?

[Lawyer Cao Yaxia's Answer] (1) He should be held suspected of committing the crime of "inciting or assisting another person to commit suicide" under Article 275, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law; (2) A report should be made to the local court or a private criminal prosecution should be filed; (3) No.

The Central Bank vigorously sold at the high price, and the upward trend was hindered and fell back. Floating long positions also eagerly sold. At noon, it retreated below 2,700,000. In the afternoon, market sentiment was even calmer. After the Central Bank vigorously sold 6,000 taels in the morning, buyers' interest decreased, and it continued to fall slightly. Compared with the previous close, there was no significant difference. Gold ornaments and silver bars were flat, silver dollars rose slightly, the black market interest was stable, and the interest rate remained between 1.2 and 1.5 corners.

According to those familiar with market conditions, there are two main reasons why it is not easy to curb the rise in gold prices: (1) The price of gold in other ports is higher than in this city, especially in Hong Kong. Therefore, the re-export of gold is inevitable. (2) Although the Central Bank is constantly selling, the cash positions of commercial banks are gradually loosening, and there is a lot of floating capital in the market, which is concentrated on the purchase of gold. The increase in gold prices, if calculated by black market interest, is more than 1%, which is the safest investment. Therefore, observing the future trend of gold prices, it may not be possible to restore the level before the upward trend began.

Foreign currencies were passively boosted, and the black market for US dollars opened in the morning at 4,850 yuan to 4,900 yuan. It once rose to more than 4,950 yuan, but after the gold market fell back, it also retreated to about 4,850 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, buyers were more cautious, and asking prices were slightly lower. Compared with the previous close, it weakened slightly. The Hong Kong dollar was stable, with the exchange rate at 945 yuan to 955 yuan. The Indian exchange rate was 1,140 yuan to 1,150 yuan. The British exchange rate was 15,150 yuan to 15,250 yuan. Transactions were not active. The official exchange rate for the US dollar did not change, but over-the-counter transactions were quiet.

### Smuggling Is Profitable; Many Seek Profit

[Nanjing News] After the government restricted the southern transport of cotton yarn and cloth, the general merchants changed their routes. They purchased spot goods from the Nanjing-Shanghai area and transported them to Hankou, and then transported them by the Yuehan Railway from Hankou to Guangzhou. In Nanjing, 20-count yarn is sold for 2.3 million yuan, while in Guangzhou, it is sold for 3.4 million yuan. Considering transportation costs and black market interest, which are estimated at 500,000 yuan per bale, a profit of 670 million yuan can still be obtained. Under the circumstances of such huge profits, most merchants are currently organizing shipping companies to engage in this business.

[Report from this Newspaper] Yesterday, the yarn market was exceptionally firm. Buyers from the inland areas who came to Shanghai to purchase yarn and thread felt that there was no way to buy it and turned to brokers to search for spot goods. It is heard that outside the market, 20-count yarn rose by another 230,000, and 42-count yarn was in high demand by weaving factories, and they raised prices to absorb it, once reaching as high as 4.3 million, a huge jump of 200,000.

Cotton cloth was selling well to buyers. Yesterday, Textile Construction sold as usual, but due to the limited supply, asking prices in the market were quite high. Serge fine cloth continued to rise by 12,000 yuan or more, and colored cloth Zhigong was stable.

### Spinning and Rubber: Relatively Profitable

According to industry insiders, there are approximately 120 types of industries in the city. The conditions of most industries this year have been affected by high interest rates and high labor costs, leading to soaring costs. Slow sales have resulted in accumulating losses. Only the cotton yarn and rubber industries are still able to make a profit, mainly because of the abundant raw materials and low purchase prices. In particular, the rubber industry is in a unique position to succeed, as it has fixed distribution agreements with retailers in various regions. The amount of goods allocated is adjusted based on sales, so market prices fluctuate accordingly. The production volume of each manufacturer can meet the needs of stores in various regions. There are approximately 30 rubber companies, with the Greater China Rubber Factory being a leader. The rise and fall of pricing is based on this factory.

### Groceries and Hardware: Weak and Declining

Previously, zinc sheets were expensive due to shortages, with No. 7 and 8 sheets reaching 1.2 million yuan per barrel. Now, with a large influx of goods from Hong Kong, prices have fallen to 800,000 yuan per barrel. Recently, there has been a significant arrival of Hunan-produced manganese powder (manganese dioxide) in Shanghai, with the price per ton falling from 600,000 yuan to 450,000-500,000 yuan. Domestic carbon rods are sufficient to supply the manufacture of batteries, and production costs are lower than imported products. Small rods cost about 9 yuan each, while German carbon rods in stock cost 40 yuan each.

### Food Grains: Weak and Falling

The rice market received a total of more than 13,000 shi from the north and south. Sales were sluggish. In the southern market, prices were firm in the morning but weakened in the afternoon. Both japonica and indica rice lacked upward movement. White Yuan and Yin Yuan rice were reduced decisively. The northern market was stagnant. Japonica and indica rice both fell by 1,000 yuan. Secondary White Yuan rice also fell by 1,000-2,000 yuan. The demand for soybeans from other areas weakened. Oil mills were reluctant to buy, with prices falling slightly by 300-500 yuan. The Fuzhou and Xinghua merchants took a small amount of bean cakes, but transactions were limited, with prices falling by 100 yuan. Both arrivals and sales of broad beans were scarce, with a flat trend. Southern Yang groundnuts remained unchanged, continuing to fall by 1,000-2,000 yuan.

### Wuxi Weaving Industry: Urgent Plea for Yarn Allocation and Relief

Representatives of Wuxi cloth factories who came to Shanghai to petition stated that before the war, there were more than 9,000 looms in Wuxi, producing more than 10,000 bolts of cloth per day. Unfortunately, the Japanese invaders caused severe losses, and now it is only four-tenths of pre-war levels. Since the summer, cloth sales have been extremely slow, while raw material expenses have risen monthly. As a result, more than a dozen small factories have been forced to close. It is regrettable that the yarn allocation in Shanghai only considers the city itself and not other areas. The price of yarn in Wuxi is one-third higher than in Shanghai, which threatens the sale of cloth. It is urgently hoped that the authorities will take fair measures regarding yarn allocation. It is reported that several factories with issuing offices in Shanghai are planning to consult with the Dyeing and Weaving Association to lease the idle looms of various weaving factories in Shanghai to weave cloth on their behalf in order to get allocated yarn. Cha Bingchu, chairman of the Changzhou Chamber of Commerce, has already contacted the Dyeing and Weaving Association on behalf of the factories in other areas to discuss this matter.

### Raw Silk Purchase: 6,000 Bales, Foreign Sales to US, France, and India

The transaction price, based on the D grade standard, is 2.5 million yuan per bale. This batch of raw silk has not yet been shipped.

### Grouped Exchange of Negotiable Instruments: Pending Decision by Banking and Money Industries

It is understood that the Clearing House has drafted a plan for all exchange firms to directly exchange in five groups and has forwarded it to the Banking and Money Industries Association for discussion and decision.

### Remittances from Overseas Chinese Mostly Diverted to Hong Kong: Large-Scale Smuggling between Hong Kong and Guangdong

[Our News] The total amount of remittances from overseas Chinese last month was 法幣7,026,380,419.96 yuan, including 法幣3,938,124,508.35 yuan and US$78,979.10 from New York, exceeding half. The number of remittances from overseas Chinese has shown a decreasing trend in the past six months. According to experts, there are two main reasons: (1) The official exchange rate of the US dollar is far from the black market rate. If overseas Chinese remit US dollars directly to the motherland, they can only be exchanged at a rate of 3,350, but if they remit to Hong Kong and then convert to Hong Kong dollars, it is obviously more profitable. In addition, the domestic political situation is unstable and production is shrinking, and foreign banks in Hong Kong are attracting funds with high interest rates, so a considerable amount of remittances from overseas Chinese has fallen into the hands of foreign banks in Hong Kong. (2) There is currently large-scale smuggling between Hong Kong and Guangdong, which urgently requires US dollar drafts for payment and is willing to buy them at high prices. As a result, some remittances from overseas Chinese are consumed in this illegal transaction. As for remedial measures, the authorities are studying them. Common sense suggests that there are two points: one is to plug the loophole in Hong Kong, which requires diplomatic efforts, and at the same time, the exchange rate of remittances from overseas Chinese must have preferential measures. The second is to strictly crack down on large-scale smuggling between Hong Kong and Guangdong, because about half of the remittances from overseas Chinese are remitted to Guangdong, so the elimination of smuggling is an indispensable step to increase remittances from overseas Chinese.

### British Businessmen's Public House: Difficult to Relocate to Hong Kong to Resume Business, Transfer of Foreign Shares is in Progress

[Our News] The British Businessmen's Public House, which was engaged in foreign stock trading in the city before the war, is currently in the process of liquidation. Due to the establishment of China's stock exchange, the Businessmen's Public House decided to dissolve. The Public House originally had more than 90 brokers, half Chinese and half foreign. Currently, all the Chinese brokers have joined the stock exchange. As for the foreign brokers, their movements are inconsistent. At the beginning of the victory, the manager of the Public House, 巴文道, left for England due to family affairs, so the liquidation work of the Public House was handed over to the deputy manager 實台克 to preside over. Many of the other foreign brokers went to England last autumn. Another group went to Hong Kong to seek development. A small number of foreign brokers have joined China's stock exchange activities in the name of companies. The main business of the Public House's liquidation work is the transfer of various foreign shares. After eight years of occupation by the enemy and puppets, the property rights are chaotic, so the transfer is particularly cautious. Also, the Shanghai Businessmen's Public House cannot be moved to Hong Kong to resume business. Because there are already two institutions in Hong Kong that operate stock trading, one is the Hong Kong Businessmen's Public House and the other is the Hong Kong Co., Ltd. In the future, the two will be merged and then resume business, but the time is still uncertain.

### Bleached Tung Oil and Hankou Telegram Surge

Although the export of bleached tung oil is not smooth, the production area has gradually increased. Recently, a telegram was received from Hankou, stating that it has been sold at 125,000 yuan per barrel. Compared with the previous market, it has increased by more than 10,000 yuan, which seems unexpected. In general, foreign trade is limited by the exchange rate and is indeed difficult to calculate. However, it is reported that recently, most exports are transshipped to foreign countries from Hong Kong, probably settled through the black market exchange rate. The increase in Hankou may be due to this. However, Shanghai has no solution, resulting in no foreign trade for a long time. It can be said to be sighing at the ocean. Because Hankou has increased, although the domestic sales season is declining, it cannot help but echo. Wholesale sales of each brand have also increased to 136,000 yuan, and sales are very light.

The sales of Hongjiang tung oil are not in season. Originally, winter was the time to prepare for spring sales, but recently, due to excessive interest rates, early preparation is beyond reach. It is estimated that it will be necessary to prepare for sales when they are close. The sales prices of various Western brands have also increased slightly with bleached tung oil to 115,000-116,000 yuan per barrel.

### Today's Opening: Silkworm Seed Improvement Design Committee, Three Main Topics to Be Discussed at the Meeting

[Our News] The Silkworm Seed Improvement Design Committee, originally scheduled to be held yesterday, was postponed to the 27th due to insufficient preparation time. The main topics of the meeting are three: (1) The issue of China adopting the European system of silkworm seeds. There are three systems of silkworm seeds in the world: one is the European system, which is characterized by high silk yield but weak constitution; one is the Chinese system, which is characterized by low silk yield but strong constitution; and the other is the Japanese system, which is between the two. For the long-term development of the silk industry in a country, it is beneficial to adopt the European system. In the future, if China adopts the European system, it can use various methods to strengthen the constitution of European system silkworm seeds after several years. On this point, the opinions of the people and the government are the same. (2) The silkworm rearing equipment in various parts of China is too simple, which is not suitable for the development of improved varieties. In the future, the 蠶種局, representatives of the people, and personnel from the Ministry of Agriculture will form an investigation team to inspect the 機場 in various places. If they do not meet the standards, they will be prohibited from continuing to use them. This issue will also be discussed in detail at this meeting. (3) China's silkworm rearing regulations have been formulated for a long time. Due to changes in objective circumstances, some points are no longer applicable and need to be revised. This will also be studied in detail at this meeting.

### British Textile Expert Talks About Improving Silk

温博登, a textile expert and member of the British Business Delegation to China, visited Japan to investigate the current situation of silk restoration and arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. According to reports, the damage to Japanese silk during the war was not significant, and it is currently actively restoring its original state. China has always been a silk country, and its products have a considerable position internationally, but if it cannot improve varieties and reduce costs, it will be difficult to compete with Japan. The reason why Japan's silk industry can recover quickly is nothing more than better varieties, more modern equipment, and higher production volume. Therefore, in order to save the crisis of China's silk industry, 温氏 believes that the first step should be to reduce native species and use new methods of silk reeling. The second step is that the buying and selling of silkworm cocoons should be based on dry cocoons instead of fresh cocoons, because it is not easy to determine the quality of silk reeling from fresh cocoons. Dry cocoons can be drawn at any time for inspection to determine their quality.

### Silk Prices Are Not Easy to Increase

The cost of raw silk in Jiangsu and Zhejiang has reached 7 million yuan per dan. The purchase price of the Central Trust Bureau is only 5 million yuan at most. The silk reeling industry cannot afford the losses. The person in charge of the Central Trust Bureau said that the pain of the silk industry should be sympathized with, but the difficulties of the government should also be taken into account. The spring silk has not been collected yet, and the autumn silk has not started yet. Whether the silk price will change again in the future depends on the government's decision.

### Increased Production of Japanese Silk

[Reuters Tokyo, 25th] According to the monthly report of the Silk Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the production of Japanese raw silk in September was 8,992 bales, slightly higher than in August. However, the number of new silk reeling basins installed in September was far more than in the previous month, almost tripling. The production of silk fabrics has not yet increased, as textile factories are rushing to manufacture a batch of silk goods designated for export.

### Egypt Plans to Promote Long-Staple Cotton to France, Italy, and Germany

[Reuters London, 25th] The Egyptian government plans to find markets in France, Poland, Italy, and the Czech Republic to promote Egyptian long-staple cotton, causing rumors that Egypt may borrow from London to achieve this goal. However, the British cotton industry severely criticized this proposal, saying that first, the amount of this loan should be as high as 20 million pounds, which will inevitably create cotton prices that are unfavorable to the British cotton industry; and second, this loan will inevitably deepen the trend of domestic inflation in Egypt.

The chairman, the representative of Mexico, 貝茲, submitted China's five proposals to a sub-committee for research.

### Chen Heqin to go to the Northeast

[Our Newspaper] Chen Heqin, President of the National Kindergarten Teachers College, is a famous children's educator in China, who usually advocates children's education without sparing effort and has extremely rich experience.

It is heard that Chen has expressed his agreement and will set off for the Northeast in the near future, intending to return to Shanghai after discussing with General Xiong Shihui.

### Fewer Students and More Students in British and American Schools: Our International Students Look at the Ocean and Sigh, Self-Funded Students Must First Negotiate with Foreign Schools, Publicly Funded Students Go Abroad Next Spring are Still in Negotiation

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 26th] Regarding the issue of this year's public and self-funded international students going abroad from the Ministry of Education, it is heard that if self-funded students have already negotiated with foreign schools to enroll, they can prepare for the formalities to go abroad. Publicly funded students are sighing at the ocean, because there are many veterans and young students returning to school in foreign countries after the war. All countries have fewer schools and more students and are overcrowded, with the United Kingdom and the United States being the most agreeable. The Ministry of Education is still in contact with various countries. After the method is negotiated, publicly funded students can go abroad. There are not many days left in the year, and the date of going abroad will be in the spring.

### Law Becomes an Education Center: Legal Knowledge Injected into Civic Education in Middle Schools, Introduction to Law Becomes a Compulsory Course in Universities

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 26th] The Ministry of Education has designated the opinion of the Education Discussion Association to pay attention to legal knowledge in secondary school civic education during this constitutional and constitutional period and to implement democratic politics in the future in middle school, and advocate "Introduction to Law" and other courses as compulsory courses in university law grades, so as to popularize legal education. Recently, the Ministry of Judicial Administration advocated that law schools should add a judicial administration group to teach judicial administration in order to remedy the defects that those who have graduated from law in the past and engaged in judicial administration positions cannot use legal ideals to serve in practice due to lack of practical experience. It is heard that the Ministry of Education highly agrees with this idea, and it is possible to issue a notice to all law schools to add a judicial administration group.

Yesterday (26th) morning at about 8 AM, Mayor Wu, accompanied by Zhang Xiaosong, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, inspected household administration, sanitation, and the progress of self-governance in the 11th District (Xincheng). He was accompanied by Wang, the District Head, and Xia, the Deputy Director of the Xincheng Police Sub-bureau, for the inspection, including the offices of the District Office and the Xincheng Sub-bureau. Subsequently, he personally went to the 25th Bao of Qingdao Road Lan Yuan Lane to check household registration, then to the 70th Bao of Dawen Road Siwen Li. Finally, he went to the 56th Bao of Zhangjia Garden on Wujiang Road to inspect, personally checking the household registration of each Bao, totaling more than ten households, all of which were accurate.

He then inspected the 2nd District Office for a week, accompanied by the District Head to check the 30th, 17th, and 5th Bao, which had the most complex household registration in the district. The Mayor first checked Hongxing Li in the 30th Bao. Then, according to a report from the 17th Bao, Ba Chuan Bank had moved in for more than half a year and repeatedly refused to fill out household registration forms despite repeated reports.

### Regular Implementation of Household Registration; Municipal Government Reaffirms Its Importance

The Municipal Government believes that household registration is the basis for notarizing the identity of the people and granting them rights and obligations. Whether in public or private law, it is deeply and significantly related to the interests of the people and should be handled with seriousness. The city's household registration began initial registration on September 17, based on the results of the September 17 household census, transcribed into various household registration books. Residents of this city who, after September 17, have matters such as household establishment, removal, emigration, immigration, birth, death, marriage, divorce, recognition, and adoption, must apply for registration within the statutory period in order to obtain legal protection for household registration. All citizens should apply diligently. The Municipal Government reviewed the key points of the Household Registration Law yesterday, issued a notice to its subordinates to comply, and sent letters to the city's party, government, and military agencies for their information.

### Guangxi's Poverty Talk

— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper in Guilin, Liang Xiaozhong, Guilin Air Dispatch on the 25th

The hungry people here are gentler than lambs. May there be a hundred good shepherds after the administrative meeting adjourns to quickly lead the lambs out of the sea of suffering!

The sufferers in the cold wind need warmth. A political gathering is like sowing a seed full of hope. How many people are waiting for it to grow strong, to find true laughter under the green shade. Some people love flowers without fruit, and more people long for fruit without flowers. This is what the people of Guangxi expect from Guangxi's politics.

### General Zhang Fakui Returns to His First Hometown

What the provincial local administrative conference brings to the people should naturally be the realization of what is in their hearts. The review and renewal work that has been barren for three years is only now being cleared by more than a hundred "parent officials" on a ruin. The triple vicissitudes of people, time, and place have increased the significance of the conference. Under the enthusiastic welcome of more than 100,000 citizens, Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters Director General Zhang Fakui returned to his "first hometown" (these are the general's own words, and from the general's life of hundreds of battles, it is very worthy of reflection). He stayed in Guilin for three days, attended the administrative meeting, and convened a pacification meeting, leaving a bright light at the intersection of Guangxi's military and political roads. What made General Zhang feel incomparably happy was not the towering decorated archways, grand banquets, and the request to present the title of "Honorary Citizen." When Mayor Su invited General Zhang to be an honorary citizen of Guilin, General Zhang smiled and said, "Guangxi is my hometown, and I also have a house in Guilin. I am already a citizen of Guilin." Rather, it was the achievement of Guangxi's dedicated reconstruction over the past year and the simple and honest "Guangxi spirit." Even when he left Guilin to inspect southeastern Guangxi, his words before departure gave unlimited encouragement to the children of Guangxi. The officials of the administrative conference also enthusiastically carried out the work of the conference under this encouragement. Chairman Jiang's reading award for Guangxi's security and stability over the years has made more people pay attention to this quiet land. On the opening day of the administrative conference, the wise Chairman Jiang also earnestly instructed: "Guangxi Province contributed the most and sacrificed the most during the Anti-Japanese War. Since the victory, the local wounds have not yet recovered, and the people's suffering awaits relief. Administrative personnel at all levels should pay attention to and conscientiously handle matters such as stabilizing order, organizing and training the people, popularizing education, promoting cooperation, and promoting construction." The concise words became the central guideline of the conference. The provincial authorities revealed the slogan of "emphasizing life and growth in construction and seeking stability from progress." Chairman Huang asked the members to "thoroughly review" and to "know everything and say everything," because conferences are often a fresh flower without fruit, a high-profile concert, a self-boasting show. Afraid of the people's headaches, it is naturally best to say as little as possible of irrelevant words. Chairman Huang saw it and considered it a real use of the state's more than 20 million conference funds and the precious time of the ten-day session. Commissioners and county magistrates established four member covenants: "actively make suggestions, earnestly review, cherish time, and reduce entertainment" (naturally, sometimes it is inevitable to send some "special products" and it is inevitable that one or two county magistrates will go in disguise to seek flowers and ask willows). If it is really done, then half of the conference is harvested. A few days of intense meetings and group life training have proven that vitality still fills the entire fiery land of Guangxi. "Cadres decide everything," and the administrative conference has decided the rebirth of Guangxi.

The provincial authorities have declared that the entire plan to rebuild Guangxi is based on the decisions of the Sixth Plenary Session. Also, politics must be democratic, economics must be democratic, and education must also be democratic. Therefore, the administrative conference is a democratic administrative conference. In the wave of democratic construction, this reporter is willing to write a few facts that are not worth underestimating from a glimpse of the leopard, and report on the pain of the people of Guangxi on the road to democracy.

### The Number of County Magistrates Subject to Disciplinary Action Accounts for Approximately 80%

As Chairman Huang said, "Guangxi has suffered the most tragic changes, unprecedented war destruction, and unprecedented famine, not only has the province's years of construction been destroyed in one fell swoop, but the entire society has also become a broken ruin." Politically, from cleaning up the chaos and mutual conflicts of the war period to returning to stability, how much helpless slaughter has been experienced in the middle, from the rampant evil officials to the return to silence, and how much rectification and clarification have been experienced, the struggle when human nature and reason cannot stand side by side, the establishment of the "political system"… writing it down is truly an interesting story. As for today's politics, how much has it gotten on track? Naturally, when praising, one can praise it as much as possible, such as the progress of security work, the soundness of local institutions, the excellence of the personnel system… counting down, almost everything is perfect and everything is good. Occasionally, when "earnestly reviewing," there is still room for discussion. What should not be said cannot be embellished. I remember that Supervisor Bai Pengfei (from Guangxi) once said, "Recent county magistrates do not put a few together as one, and build them to be qualified to be parent officials." An interesting statistical chart states that as of the end of the thirty-fourth year, the number of incumbent county magistrates in Guangxi subject to disciplinary action accounted for 79.20%. This is the government's evaluation. As for the "cadres" and the people's evaluation in their hearts, it is naturally another matter. Looking deeper, security work is good, but one must ask more about recuperation, reducing government and being close to the people; local institutions are sound, but one must ask more about administrative efficiency; personnel systems must also ask about selecting the worthy and the capable… it is a long story, and a grand theory seems irrelevant, but it will never be groundless. The answer is placed on the puzzle, that's all.

### Director of Construction Speaks of Poverty, Comparing Himself to a Beggar Leader

Construction is an extremely difficult task in Guangxi. Rebuilding everything is the unanimous request of more than 13 million people. However, today's situation can be described with the eight words "empty of people and wealth, industry and commerce withered," writing out the suffering of this province. In addition to the fact that talent is simply unimaginable, whether it is everything waiting to be started and then stopped, it is like Clausewitz's view of the elements of war: "First, money; second, money; third, still money." Not to mention anything else, from a financial point of view, October is over, and the funds have not yet been settled, causing all measures to fall into a state of paralysis, so that the Director of Construction told General Zhang Fakui that he was a "beggar leader." Transportation needs to be restored, but requests for funds are not approved. Constructing farmland irrigation, the Relief Administration is "more than capable but less than willing" and unwilling to help. It seems that construction is only Guangxi's family affair. The government completely neglects or rather favors the construction work of some provinces, which is an undeniable fact. Since the revision of the fiscal revenue and expenditure system, it has simply been stretched to the limit. The total monthly income of Guangxi's poor counties is truly regrettable when spoken of, but only two million yuan (such as Zhenjie, Pingxiang, etc.), which is less than a meal for a wealthy person at sea. Therefore, more than 30 cities and counties need provincial subsidies, totaling more than 830 million yuan. Pulling up and down, the word "construction" has vanished from it and turned into a short-term measure. Since local income is low, various tricks are used, resulting in the state of "now there is nothing left to donate." At the administrative meeting, Director Yang reported that there were as many as eleven kinds of local rents and taxes, how can the people bear it?

### Rural Recovery Is Less Than One in Ten

The basic of construction is inseparable from the revival of the countryside. In Guangxi, the recovery of the countryside is "less than one in ten." Coupled with heavy oppression, "that one" is almost falling. The greatest suffering of farmers is nothing more than the exploitation and extraction caused by land rights. The provincial order to reduce rent by 25% must be completed before autumn, but only 36 counties reported the exchange (Guangxi has one hundred counties (whether it has really been done is still a question). Nearly seventy counties that have not reported the exchange show how the dark forces in the locality are bullying the ignorant farmers. In addition, Guangxi's total land tax was 2.5 million yuan in the early Republic of China, but suddenly increased to 7.8 million yuan in the thirty-second year. Adding requisitions and surcharges, the amount to be borne is an astronomical figure. Requests for reduction and exemption have been made repeatedly, but to no avail. Hunan went to ask and obtained a quarter. These things sometimes make the people of Guangxi feel a little sad. Rural bankruptcy, what is there to talk about construction? Therefore, there seems to be a kind of contemplation and anxiety about the issue of construction at the administrative meeting. It is generally believed that there is no other way but to rely on self-reliance. For example, there are no less than 400,000 mu of wasteland in each county, but only 50,000 mu are being reclaimed. In addition to the automatic construction by the people in rich counties, the construction of water conservancy is not top-notch. To be frank, the lack of people and money is the reason, and the irresponsibility of the responsible persons is also the reason.

The administrative conference has no specific measures to support industry and commerce. However, Chairman Huang once said the premise of support: "At present, private capital in Guangxi is still very thin and has not reached the stage of restraint. On the contrary, it should be encouraged." This can be regarded as a kind of method. However, private capital in Guangxi may first promote the way out of bureaucratic capital. Otherwise, how can such a large "trade company" be run? The rulers have good intentions, but reality is a layer of shadow. The revitalization of industry and commerce must start with politics.

Active construction is the best way to relieve the people. The administrative conference is the cradle of constructing a new Guangxi. On the land full of famine and poverty, people are waiting in silence for bright flowers to bear strong fruits. In the past few days, the parent officials have been complaining about poverty and suffering, and have also put forward valuable measures and precious opinions. Dimness is one side, and light is also one side. Now is the time when light and darkness are fighting!

Attached is an interesting episode. After Director Zhang came to Guilin before the administrative conference, the provincial authorities convened the heads of various agencies to report the difficulties of administrative work to Director Zhang. Everyone unreservedly reported the word "poor." Director Zhang expressed great sympathy and agreed to immediately transfer requests such as repairing highways and exempting the telecommunications bureaus of 26 counties, including Dongnao, to the relevant central departments for handling. Only when Huang Ronghua, the director of the Relief Sub-Administration, reported that there were no ships to transport relief supplies, General Zhang said, "You are not being honest in your report. If you say there are no ships, come with me to Guangzhou to ask for them." Director Huang repeatedly said, "Thank you, Director." Director Huang thanked the Director, and the refugees in Dongjiang Town, Guilin also "thanked the Director." General Zhang passed by the refugee camp and immediately donated 300,000 yuan to them, making the refugees happy. It is unknown what Director Huang felt.

Also, in the speech of Mr. Hu Peide, the representative of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, at the opening of the administrative conference, he said, "Whether my food has reached the hands of the hungry depends on you, because you are all officials close to the people." It is quite thought-provoking, so it is recorded as "relief anecdotes."

God's followers "gather those lambs." Guangxi's hungry people are gentler than lambs. May there be a hundred gentle shepherds after the administrative conference adjourns to quickly lead the lambs out of the sea of suffering! (Sent on the 25th)

### A Comparison of the Five-Power Constitution and the British and American Constitutions

— From Our Newspaper's Reference Room

The National Assembly has formally opened in the capital today, and its mission is to enact a constitution. The constitutional blueprint under discussion is the revised draft of the May 5th Constitution, promulgated in the 25th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1936] and recently revised, which is to say, a constitution embodying the spirit of the separation of five powers. The Five-Power Constitution was originally created by the Founding Father [Sun Yat-sen] and imbued with his consistent ideal of nation-building. The first article of the Founding Father's late-life "Fundamentals of National Reconstruction" stipulated that "the National Government shall build the Republic of China based on the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution of the Revolution," demonstrating that the implementation of the Five-Power Constitution is inseparable from the ideals of the Three Principles of the People.

The constitutions of various modern European and American countries mostly adopt the traditional system of the separation of three powers, which is inherently incomplete in principle and prone to many malpractices in practice. After years of meticulous research, the Founding Father selected its advantages, corrected its defects, and based on new ideas and theories, in response to the actual needs of China's nation-building, created the Five-Power Constitution.

The Five-Power Constitution is different from the constitutions of Britain and the United States. What are its characteristics? Why is the Five-Power Constitution superior to the constitution of the separation of three powers? This article intends to conduct a comparative study on these issues.

Let's start with Britain: Britain is an advanced country in constitutionalism, and its constitutional development has gradually evolved over seven or eight hundred years. However, precisely because Britain's constitutionalism has evolved step by step, Britain still does not have an independent and complete legal code. For this reason, people generally call the British constitution an "unwritten constitution." In British history, many famous documents constitute part of the constitution, such as the famous Magna Carta of 1215, the Petition of Right of 1628, the Bill of Rights of 1689, the Act of Settlement of 1700, and the parliamentary election laws of 1832, 1867, 1884, and 1918...etc. At the same time, there are many customs and precedents that have become part of the unwritten constitution because everyone observes them. This is a significant feature of the British constitution. For example, if the British cabinet loses the confidence of the House of Commons, it should resign as a whole or ask the King to dissolve Parliament and hold new elections. However, if the newly elected members still vote no confidence in the cabinet, then the cabinet must resign. This is a long-standing and unchanging practice, but there is no such provision in any written document. Precisely because the British constitution is unwritten, it is also flexible, which means it is easy to amend. For example, the method of parliamentary elections has been changed three or four times before forming today's universal suffrage system. New documents and practices can naturally replace old ones and become part of the unwritten constitution without going through cumbersome constitutional amendment procedures.

Britain is a constitutional monarchy, so in name, the British monarch holds the supreme power of legislation, judiciary, and administration. However, in reality, as everyone knows, the British monarch has no real power because legislative power lies in Parliament (laws must be submitted to the King for approval after passing, but this is only a formality), judicial power lies in the courts (although judgments must use the name "on behalf of the King"), and executive power lies in the cabinet. The Prime Minister of the cabinet is the leader of the majority party, and cabinet members are selected by the Prime Minister. All policies are decided by the cabinet.

This system of responsible cabinet government is the central spirit of British constitutionalism. Under the system of responsible cabinet government, legislative power and executive power are interdependent but also mutually restrained. The cabinet's job is to carry out various government affairs, and the Prime Minister and cabinet members are in fact members of Parliament, who can attend Parliament, participate in discussions and votes, so legislative power and executive power are interdependent. But on the other hand, if Parliament is dissatisfied with the actions of the cabinet, it can propose a vote of no confidence, forcing the cabinet to resign. The cabinet can also request the King to dissolve Parliament to confront it. Here, Parliament is not only a legislative body, but also a body representing public opinion. If the cabinet feels that the Parliament's vote of no confidence does not represent public opinion, then it can request the King to dissolve Parliament and have the voters re-elect members. It can be seen that all decisions are still in the hands of the voters, not in the hands of the King, not in the hands of the Prime Minister, and not in the hands of those members who act arbitrarily. This is the democratic spirit under British constitutionalism.

Parliament should originally be above all else. It can enact new laws, amend or repeal any old laws, propose a vote of no confidence in the cabinet responsible for administration, forcing the cabinet to resign, raise questions, individually impeach members, or reject bills proposed by the government. So, on the surface, it seems that Parliament controls everything. But in fact, the Prime Minister in the cabinet is the leader of the majority party in Parliament. Due to the increasingly strict organization and operation of modern political parties, the cabinet can actually control Parliament in many ways. Because the Prime Minister is the leader of the majority party and the cabinet members are all members of the majority party, then the bills proposed by the cabinet in Parliament will in fact receive the support of its own party (i.e., the majority party) in Parliament. Even if the opposition party rises up to obstruct, the bill can still pass. In this situation, executive power will obviously overwhelm legislative power.

The British constitutional model certainly has its special advantages, but we must not forget that this is what they have achieved through seven or eight hundred years of improvement and evolution. China's constitutional movement is only thirty or forty years old, and the general level of knowledge of the people is not as high as that of Britain. Applying an unwritten and flexible constitution is in fact impossible. Therefore, the Five-Power Constitution should be a rigid, written legal code. Speaking of the implementation of constitutionalism, in the British system of responsible cabinet government, it is difficult to clearly separate legislative power and executive power to seek balance. The result is either Parliament has no power or the government is incompetent. This is inconsistent with the ideals of the Founding Father, so the National Assembly system and the Five-Yuan system can remedy this shortcoming. The Executive Yuan in the Five Yuans only exercises executive power and absolutely cannot control legislative power. At the same time, it is not subject to the control of legislative power. This point is much more advanced than the system of responsible cabinet government. On the other hand, the division of power and ability under the Five-Power Constitution is very clear. The people have the power to control the government, and the government can fully exert its administrative capabilities. In addition, the rights of the people are also clearly stipulated in the Five-Power Constitution and included in the written legal code. It can be seen that the Five-Power Constitution has the advantages of the British constitution without the disadvantages of the British constitution.

Secondly, let's talk about the United States: The constitutional history of the United States is of course much later than that of Britain. On July 4, 1776, the world-famous "Declaration of Independence" was issued, and the "Articles of Confederation" were promulgated the following year. This was the precursor to the American Constitution. In 1787, representatives of the states held a constitutional convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The draft was completed on September 17 of that year, passed by the states the following year, and in 1789, the federal government was established in accordance with the new constitution.

The nature of the American Constitution is the opposite of the British Constitution: it is a written and rigid constitution. The full text of the American Constitution has only seven articles, each of which is divided into several sections except for the fifth, sixth, and seventh articles. The full text of the constitution has only over four thousand words, which is the shortest constitution in the world. Although there are only four thousand words, the implementation of federal legislative, judicial, and executive powers, the relationship between the federal central government and the states, the amendment of the constitution, and the provisions for the freedom and rights of the people are all included in this constitution.

Such a simple constitution is of course clear, but therefore the flexibility must be quite large. Some things can only be supplemented by the usual practices to make up for the inadequacies of the constitution. For example, the President of the United States shall not be re-elected for three terms. There is no such provision in the constitution, but because presidents in the past have never been re-elected for three terms, this has become a practice. However, President Roosevelt broke this practice because he was supported and loved by the people and was elected for four terms.

The American Constitution is a very prominent constitution of the separation of three powers: executive power belongs to the President, legislative power belongs to Congress, and judicial power belongs to the Supreme Court, with mutual restraint and balance. The President is both the nominal and actual head of state (this is very different from the situation in Britain). The President decides policies and is not responsible to Congress for policies. Therefore, under the American constitutional system, executive power and legislative power are completely separated. Congress's impeachment of the President and cabinet members is limited to illegal acts. As for policies, Congress can only let it go even if it is dissatisfied. There is no way to cast a vote of no confidence like in Britain. The President of the United States is elected every four years. If Congress is dissatisfied with the President, it can only prevent him from being re-elected after the four-year term expires, but during his four-year term in office, there is no real way to deal with him.

The United States is a federal country, so its constitution is also a "dual constitution" rather than a "unitary constitution." In other words, the federal government has its own constitution, and each state also has its own constitution. The federal government has its own exclusive powers, such as military affairs and diplomacy, while each state government also has its own exclusive powers, such as education and police. The powers of the federal government in the constitution are enumerated, while the powers of each state are generalized. As for the judiciary, the federal government has federal courts, and each state has state courts, with different organizations. Looking at the overall trend, the American Constitution is biased towards local decentralization. This is due to the history of the American Constitution. The United States first had the states and then organized the federation. In terms of order, the powers of the federation were divided from the states, so the color of local decentralization is naturally particularly strong in the American Constitution.

The American Constitution is also full of emphasis on the protection of individual freedom. Because the constitution's protection of individual freedom in most countries is only for executive power. As for the legislative body, since it represents public opinion, in theory it should have the right to enact laws to restrict people's freedom. However, the amendments to the American Constitution in 1789 added a chapter on the rights of the people, which restricted Congress from enacting laws that interfered with people's freedom. After the Civil War, three more articles were added to prohibit the states from enacting laws that restricted people's rights. This is not common in the constitutions of various countries.

However, the main starting point of the spirit of the American Constitution is the federal political system. Since China has always been a unified, unitary country, such a constitution cannot be applied in many aspects. As for the issue of the division of power between the central government and local governments, the Five-Power Constitution also has the same provisions. Speaking of the Five-Yuan system in the Five-Power Constitution, judging from the organizational relationship between the President and the Executive Yuan, it seems very similar to the British system of responsible cabinet government; but from the point of view of the President's popular election and the powers the President possesses, it is very similar to the American-style presidential system. In fact, the Five-Power Constitution combines the strengths of both. Furthermore, in terms of the mutual relationship between legislative power and executive power, the legislative power and executive power under the Five-Yuan system are neither combined into one like the system of responsible cabinet government, nor are they separated like the presidential system, but rather the legislative, executive, judicial, examination, and control powers can all be used independently and relatedly. Most importantly, the Five-Power Constitution advocates the separation of power and ability, so that political power and governing power will not be confused. This is more advanced and rational than the American Constitution of the separation of three powers.

Therefore, the Five-Power Constitution is very different from the traditional three-power constitutions in the world in terms of spirit, goals, methods, and focus. China's constitutional work has been carried out relatively late. Being late also has its advantages, that is, it is easy to adopt the advantages of various countries' constitutions and seek appropriate remedies based on the experience gained from their implementation. If we study the history of the advanced countries in constitutionalism in Europe and the United States, we can see that the special nature of a country's constitution must have its fundamental reasons for its founding and actual needs. Therefore, unitary countries do not necessarily adopt centralization, such as Britain; and federal countries do not necessarily adopt decentralization, such as the Soviet Union. Understanding this fact, we can know that a constitution cannot be copied and imitated, but must be formulated based on the country's different history and national conditions. Under the Five-Power Constitution, the people have the power to control the government, so the government can be omnipotent without being dictatorial. The powers of the central government and local governments are neither centralized nor decentralized, but are only divided according to the actual needs of the affairs, so that the advantages of centralization and decentralization can be obtained without the malpractices of mutual restraint between the two. This is the spirit of the Five Powers and also the place where the Five-Power Constitution is superior to the constitutions of other countries.

### Chrysanthemum Exhibition in Holland

— Dispatch from Leiden on the 18th, Special Correspondent of Our Newspaper to Ren

The Dutch are known worldwide for their skill in growing flowers. The chrysanthemum exhibition and competition held in the city of Leiden in the autumn of 1946 was a grand event of post-war revival. The exhibition lasted for seven days and attracted 12,000 visitors.

Chrysanthemums came from the Far East. In Europe, they are commonly seen in two sizes, large and small. The large ones first came from Japan and existed during the reign of Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty. Westerners used them for medicinal purposes to treat uterine cramps. The Latin name is Matricaria, and the Dutch name is Moedekruid, which coincidentally matches the Chinese name "女花" (woman flower). It is said that the large and small chrysanthemums exhibited by the Dutch today mostly came from China. The small ones were brought back by the Dutch botanist Rumphius, who traveled to Asia in the fifteenth year of Emperor Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty. Initially, only one yellow variety was obtained. Therefore, Linnaeus of Sweden gave it the universally accepted Greek scientific name Chrysanthemum, which is like Eastern poets calling chrysanthemums "金英" (golden flower). Later, the large chrysanthemums from China were transferred to England by the Englishman Fortune in the twenty-eighth year of Emperor Daoguang of the Qing Dynasty. Soon, they were spread to the Netherlands via France. The Dutch first held a chrysanthemum exhibition in the sixth year of Emperor Guangxu.

A century ago, there were only forty or fifty kinds of Chinese chrysanthemums in Europe. Since the discovery of Ln-oculate grafting in the twenty-third year of Emperor Daoguang, artificial manipulation has been able to create more and more varieties of flowers with richer categories, such as the English Queen of England, Prince of Wales, Annie Salter, and other strange names. These are mostly the names of florists or the names of dignitaries and women, with no meaning to be found. They are not like the Chinese, who are good at using vocabulary to create new terms, with metaphors such as imperial robes representing yellow, 御白 (imperial white) representing white, 艶陽 (gorgeous sun) representing red, and 楊妃 (Yang Guifei) representing light red, all of which evoke touching aesthetic feelings.

Today, the status of Chinese people overseas is increasing day by day. It seems that this chrysanthemum exhibition, which has the most historical relationship with China, and Westerners vying to tell the old stories of the East, getting its way and spiritualizing its use, can become a heaven-made international beautiful story. After the end of the exhibition, after 630 votes of selection, it was decided that the large white chrysanthemum named Editon Alston was the most beautiful flower in the whole field. I have composed two poems in praise of the white chrysanthemum to mark the celebration, and I dare not compete with Bai Letian [Bai Juyi] for fame. The poems say: "The colors fade, leaving a fragrant and secluded scene, the golden country strengthens the divine state, strive to avoid being misled by the west wind, and send the old sunshine to the white head. Dreams are in the flower for ten thousand ages, and the Shanghai garden expands with deep small windows. Now the national nurture is creating new styles, more valuable than gold, seeing white gold." (White gold, according to the Greek scientific name, is a synonym for white chrysanthemum. The Shanghai garden refers to the old residence at 16 Xujiahui Road twenty-seven years ago.)

### The Anemic Education in Guangdong Province

— Guangzhou Dispatch on the 22nd, Special Correspondent of Our Newspaper Liang Feng

Too Few Schools, Too Many People Wanting to Study

The current population of Guangzhou City is 1.2 million, but how many schools are there? There are only nine public middle schools and twenty private middle schools, totaling only enough to accommodate over twenty thousand students. In terms of elementary schools, the number of municipal elementary schools has increased by twenty-two schools compared to the previous semester, with a total of sixty-four schools. There are about eight hundred private elementary schools, which together can accommodate at most fifty thousand people. This is still far from the lowest estimated number of people needing to attend school. Because demand exceeds supply, schools have become rare commodities, leading to rampant malpractices and turning sacred education into commercialization and bureaucratization. If you want to send your child to a public school, you not only have to spend money to maneuver, but also ask for favors. Even if you are lucky enough to pass the first hurdle and get in, what happens after you get in? Tuition is not a problem, and miscellaneous fees are not much. However, what about books and a set of uniforms? This will cost at least tens of thousands of yuan, and the usual paper notebooks, pens, ink, etc., cost an average of two to three hundred yuan per day. If the school is newly built, then you have to donate even the desks and chairs, otherwise the school will have to repair the school buildings, and this amount of money will have to be raised from each student's family. Or the teachers will ask the students to borrow rice, and then simply call it "respect-teacher rice." Adding up these odds and ends, the cost of a student in a semester is at least fifty to sixty thousand yuan. Considering that the current monthly salary of a general civil servant in Guangzhou is only a little over one hundred thousand yuan, it is enough to make you gasp for breath to have one child in school. If you don't have personal connections and can't afford to send your child to a private school, then you have to let them drop out of school or find employment or go into business. It is unknown how many school-age children are rejected outside the school gates by this situation!

As for the education situation in the counties, it is said that the mountains are high and the emperor is far away. No matter how strictly the authorities order that no extra tuition and miscellaneous fees should be charged, they still turn a blind eye, allowing private schools in various villages to compete to charge tuition fees. The fees charged are not twenty or thirty thousand yuan, but are based on grain or rice. Miscellaneous fees include essential foods such as sesame oil. Therefore, when the rural economy collapses, studying becomes a superfluous thing.

The Ratio of Population to Students in This Province

Perhaps you will doubt how many schools there are in Guangdong Province? According to the reporter's investigation, there are a total of ten higher education institutions in the province, including one national university, three private universities, two provincial colleges, three private colleges, and five provincial and private vocational schools, accommodating over fourteen thousand students. In terms of secondary schools, there are 557 schools, including 448 middle schools, 64 normal schools, and 45 vocational schools, with over 141,400 students. As for elementary schools, there are 22,917 schools, including 3,326 central national schools, 16,643 national schools, and 2,948 private elementary schools, with 2 million students. The total number of all levels of schools above is 23,588, with a total of only over 2,155,400 students. If calculated based on the population ratio of this province, there is only one middle school student for every 250 people, and we dare not imagine the number of university students.

In addition, although social education has progressed in number compared to before the war, with folk education centers increasing from 72 to 81, libraries increasing from 54 to 85, and sports fields increasing from 87 to 97, the actual education has been forgotten and is only used as a decoration!

The Schools Themselves Also Have Many Shortcomings

In fact, although there are few schools in Guangdong Province, the schools themselves also have many shortcomings: (1) Taking secondary schools as an example, there are too few normal and vocational schools. Without special skills, it is difficult to gain a foothold in society, and the lack of teachers affects the next generation of citizens. (2) Due to financial constraints, good teachers cannot be hired, and reference books and instruments are all lacking, causing the general level of students to decline day by day, the academic atmosphere to be rampant, and the spirit of learning to be decadent. (3) Schools have become commercialized, education has been tainted with the atmosphere of merchants, and it has even invaded the perfunctory and opportunistic human relations in the officialdom. (4) Due to the lack of vitality in the academic atmosphere itself, it is taken advantage of by treacherous and false people, who seize students as tools for political struggle, and schools as places for competition, inciting student unrest and causing strikes, and many students with weak wills suffer. The authorities are not unaware of the seriousness of the above situation. Yao Baoyou, the director of the Education Department, also frankly admitted that the school buildings of various schools are dilapidated, the equipment is simple, the students' physical fitness is weak, the academic atmosphere is not vigorous, the level is low, and the quality is not excellent. However, due to the shortage of education funds and the meager salaries of teachers, even a clever daughter-in-law cannot cook without rice.

Only a Fraction of the 400 Million Yuan Reconstruction Funds Received

Perhaps you will ask, hasn't the central government already allocated 400 million yuan for education reconstruction? Yes, the provincial government applied to the central government for 3.4 billion yuan, but only a fraction was approved. How is this amount allocated? It is calculated as follows: 10 million yuan for education administration, 146 million yuan for higher education, only 53.6 million yuan for secondary education, 17 million yuan for normal education, 17.4 million yuan for vocational education, 10 million yuan for social education, 140 million yuan for scientific equipment, and a total of 5.68 million yuan for subsidizing the education of refugee children and health education. The total includes nine items of expenditure. From the above figures, we can know that the subsidies received by each school are very few. With such a drop in the bucket of funds, how can schools be rebuilt, how can school equipment be enriched, and how can education not decline day by day?

Although the provincial education authorities here have recently formulated seven guidelines for the entire education: (1) Popularize national education through normal education. (2) Promote local autonomy through national education. (3) Improve national health through national sports. (4) Coordinate economic construction through vocational education. (5) Cultivate a good academic atmosphere through strict discipline. (6) Transform social customs with a good academic atmosphere. (7) Improve cultural standards through scientific research. In order to remedy the crisis facing the extremely anemic education on the surface, this is only a symptomatic method. How to deal with the over 12 million young people who are wandering the streets and dropping out of school is the most urgent issue at the moment. I think the future of education and the trend of culture in Guangdong Province are beyond endurance!

### Glimpses of Eastern Hebei

— Air Report on the 19th, Our Tianjin Reporter Li Shaolin

On the 14th of this month, the reporter had an opportunity to depart from Tianjin and take a look at the situation in Eastern Hebei along the Beining Railway, only turning back after reaching Shanhaiguan. During this trip, I visited Tangshan, strolled around Qinhuangdao, climbed and gazed from Shanhaiguan, and browsed Beidaihe. However, time was short, and I could only superficially observe the conditions along the way, without conducting in-depth investigations. During August and September of this year, the Beining Railway experienced its most turbulent period, with the Communist army constantly sabotaging the railway day and night. The entire Eastern Hebei region was filled with the smell of gunpowder. In September and October, the National Army took active measures, and the county seats of various counties were successively recovered. After returning from this inspection, I gained a general impression: that public security has largely been restored, but not comprehensively.

Zhang Guizhuang, Junliangcheng

Shortly after the special train left Tianjin, it entered the Zhang Guizhuang-Junliangcheng area, an important rice-producing region in North China. This stretch of paddy fields extends all the way to the edge of the coast near Tanggu. This area was originally saline-alkali land, but during the enemy-puppet period, the Japanese dug canals and established water conservancy projects, using river water to wash and transform it into paddy fields, which are now taken over by our authorities. Near Tangshan, there is irrigation from the Jian River. Near Jie County, the Luan River flows vertically. In the Changli area, there are also several small rivers irrigating the land. This is the rich agricultural region of Eastern Hebei and also the area with the most abundant mineral resources. Although it is the beginning of winter, the reporter did not feel cold along the way. As the train sped along its journey, looking out the window, one could see the desolate fields after the autumn harvest, with thick green wheat seedlings already growing in the fields. Clusters of trees still had some leaves that had not been blown off by the cold wind. Many farmers were working in the fields, giving the impression of great peace.

Tangshan City: Industry and Mining

Tangshan is a city of sixty square li, which developed with the development of the Kailuan Coal Mining Company. It is only half a century old, but now there are more than twenty large industrial and mining enterprises in the city. In addition to Kailuan, the North Hebei Electric Power Company power plant is the source of Tangshan's power. The Railway Bureau's repair factory is currently the largest factory in the country that can repair and build railway locomotives. The Qixin Cement Company is a strong force in future national defense construction. These many industrial and mining enterprises constitute Tangshan's life.

Of Tangshan's population of over 136,000, 39% are workers. Tangshan's prices directly follow Tianjin's. General merchandise comes from Tianjin and is more expensive than in Tianjin. Food is cheaper than in Tianjin, with rice and flour costing 600 yuan per jin, and pork costing 1,600 yuan per jin. The group with the most difficult life in society is still public school teachers, whose salaries range from 30,000 to 50,000 yuan for those with low salaries, and over 100,000 yuan for those with high salaries. The salaries of general workers are mostly 170,000 to 180,000 yuan, so the service conditions of workers are quite good, and there are no serious labor-management disputes.

Ice-Free Port: Qinhuangdao

The elegance of Qinhuangdao's scenery is just like that of other coastal cities, and in addition to being worthy of appreciation, as an ice-free port, it will inevitably have to shoulder an important task this winter. Because after Huludao and Tanggu freeze, all ships can only rely on entering the wharves of Qinhuangdao. However, Qinhuangdao only has two wharves, and both are owned by the Kailuan Coal Mining Company, capable of berthing only six or seven ships. To have it shoulder a major task, it still needs to be strengthened in all aspects. Qinhuangdao is under the jurisdiction of Linyu County and currently has a population of just over 10,000, of which stevedores of the Kailuan Company account for 5,000. Currently, the Administrative Inspector of the First District of Hebei Province is stationed in Qinhuangdao. The district under the jurisdiction of the inspector includes Linyu, Funing, Changli, Luan County, Qian'an, Lulong, and Leting counties, as well as Dushan, a newly established administrative bureau. Inspector Tao Xinru said that Leting and Dushan in the jurisdiction are still occupied by the Communist army, and the security between towns and villages in the recovered counties is still not good. The autumn harvest in Eastern Hebei was good this year, but it was looted by the Communist army, and the common people are suffering from food shortages. He feels that the most serious problems in Eastern Hebei are food and security. To maintain security, the basic method is to strengthen the organization of local militias. He said that the current local militias urgently need to be strengthened.

Shanhaiguan, Beidaihe

The momentum of Shanhaiguan is magnificent. In the midst of the morning mist, I walked onto the gate and looked out into the distance. I saw the mountains to the north, like huge waves stirred up by a hurricane in the sea, stretching endlessly and towering in the sky. The Great Wall vaguely winds above. Looking south, there is an endless sea. The Northeast outside the pass surprised me. It was so quiet that it was depressing. The undulating mountains seemed to be frozen, further emphasizing the feeling of loneliness. On the way back, I strolled around Beidaihe for three hours. Walking into the winter seaside can only give people a sense of desolation. Breaking through this desolation are only sporadic gunshots still intermittently resounding in various parts of Eastern Hebei, but who would want to hear these terrifying gunshots?

### Inside Washington: War Inevitable, U.S. Officials Say "Closer Day by Day"

— Translated by Our Editorial Department, Original by Mrs. Klapp of Observer Magazine

What exactly are the real difficulties of the current world situation? You should take a look at what's happening behind the scenes in Washington. Public officials will privately tell you that another war is inevitable. They treat this terrible trend as a reality but dare not tell the American people publicly.

Wallace's criticism of the government's foreign policy and his forced resignation as Secretary of Commerce show the seriousness of the situation. But this is just one sign of the difficulties. Here are a few conversations I've heard, which can also serve as a reference:

(1) A young veteran who returned from the Pacific wanted to see the President. He wanted to ask the President to lead the countries in advocating for the revision of the United Nations Charter. The President canceled this appointment at the last minute because he was too busy. Later, this veteran met a Presidential secretary, and he talked endlessly about how the peace plan could be effective. The secretary listened impatiently and suddenly interrupted him, saying, "Young man, don't mess around. We'll fight the Soviet Union at any time."

### Sooner or Later, Real War Will Break Out

(2) Recently, a government official told me, "Yes, we are currently in a government at war, just like in 1939. We know that a real war will definitely come, just as night follows day. We have no way to stop it, we just feel it getting closer day by day."

(3) At a gathering, I heard a U.S. Senator say, "The gap between the Eastern and Western national groups is already too deep and cannot be mended. Sooner or later, we will have to fight."

(4) A former important assistant in the U.S. State Department admitted that we are engaged in a power race. This race, he lamented, "always leads to the road of war." He explained the concept of "balance of power" and pointed out that the hope for the success of the United Nations depends entirely on the consensus between the Soviet Union and the United States. But he then shocked me by saying: if the two strongest countries cannot stand together, then the United Nations is not established to maintain peace.

World Government: Impractical

If you naively propose the hope of a world government and advocate that it possesses sufficient force to prevent the outbreak of war, then someone will laugh at you for being "impractical."

Few people in Washington harbor such empty hopes. Public officials only verbally praise the United Nations. Once the congressional elections in November are over, you will see the most intense arms race in history.

Not long ago, six members of the House Armed Services Committee returned from an inspection of the Pacific and warned that another Pearl Harbor event may occur in the future. U.S. Air Force General Spaatz has said that the gateway for the United States to be attacked from the north is wide open. General Eisenhower advocated forming a strong army. The Navy needs technicians.

Of course, opinions vary on the timing of the real outbreak of war. One speaker feared that a random event would be enough to cause disaster, such as the recent shooting down of a U.S. plane by Yugoslavia, which may cause war. But most officials know that the countries that oppose democratic countries are very poor economically, so they believe that there are still five, ten, or twenty-five years before the outbreak of war.

U.S. Should Take the Initiative

This year is a congressional election year, and 1948 is a presidential election year. I raise this point because domestic politics and the future of the country are closely related. Very few politicians have imagined what the future war will look like, and even those who have imagined it do not dare to tell the voters frankly, because they remember how much resentment President Roosevelt aroused among the people in 1937 after saying that war was coming.

But these concerns of the candidates may be unnecessary. Many citizens may be willing to listen to constructive opinions. Even fools know that in a future war, the country that strikes first is generally the victor. But this is difficult for our country. We ourselves know, just as our enemies know, that the United States has never taken the initiative in aggression. But scientists tell us that our cities can be destroyed by rocket atomic bombs in a matter of hours. The American people know that other countries can also obtain the secrets of the atomic bomb, and there is no way to defend against the atomic bomb. However, from the nature of the United States, we cannot strike first.

The American people understand this very well. They have become so uneasy that daily life has become a chronic terror. At the dinner table, and in fact in every place, the topic of conversation is currently World War III.

### Germ Warfare is More Terrible Than the Atomic Bomb

We are beginning to fear germ warfare even more than we fear the atomic bomb. Germ warfare does not require a large concentration of industrial work. Highly destructive bacteria can be released to us, and we will know nothing about it beforehand. Many people still remember the influenza epidemic of 1918, when one in fifty people died every month on average around the world. This mortality rate was unprecedented in history. Dr. Clay, former assistant director of the Institute for Scientific Research, predicts that germs as infectious as influenza and as deadly as the plague can kill more people than atomic bombs.

We must be on the front line of the attack in another war. While the State Department is trying to infuse life into the framework of the United Nations, while the Army is engaged in rocket research, testing super-aircraft in the Arctic, and accumulating atomic bombs, is anyone designing how to save our people?

According to the Constitution, the first person to bear this responsibility is the President of the United States.

### Seven Methods the President Should Implement

— Nan

A courageous president should not sit patiently in Washington, just daydreaming. He should act, even if there are places where he occasionally oversteps the bounds. His course of action may be as follows:

(1) Review the entire situation of the Soviet Union to find out what they are planning. Use every possible means, including espionage, to find the facts. The Soviet Union has already used espionage in the United States, Canada, and Britain to spy on our military secrets. In order to maintain peace, there is no reason to oppose our doing the same.

If diplomats and intelligence personnel do not know what the Soviet Union is doing, then they should be punished, and even Secretary of State Byrnes and Senator Vandenberg are no exception.

(2) Design a peace that allows the United States and the Soviet Union to live together in friendship in the same world.

(3) Ask Stalin to hold a summit meeting to jointly consider this plan. Tell him clearly that war will be decided in this meeting, not in many lengthy and fruitless future meetings.

(4) At this meeting, there should be sufficient time to fully discuss our plan and any suggestions that the Soviet Union may make. The President can make concessions when he should, without overemphasizing national self-esteem, but realistically considering any sincere proposal. But he must be absolutely certain that any agreement or guarantee acknowledged or provided by the Soviet Union is reliable and can be implemented.

(5) Before, after, and during the meeting, the President should do everything possible to tell the American people every progress he makes; he should constantly maintain contact with the people through radio.

(6) If the Soviet Union cannot accept any plan that does not excessively hurt the emotions of the American people, or if the United States feels that the plan drafted with the Soviet Union requires the United States to make too many concessions, then the President should take another route. He should convene military and economic advisors and ask them to draft a plan for a full-scale war against the Soviet Union.

(7) Promote the implementation of a six-month or one-year mobilization plan in the United States, stipulating a definite date for the reorganization of armaments and mobilization.

If we make all the concessions that do not harm our national dignity, and the Soviet Union still insists on going its own way, then we will be compelled to propose this solution to the Soviet Union: You must make some concessions for peace, or we will fight.

In this situation, nine times out of ten, the Soviet Union will adopt a more compromising attitude and change its foreign policy. They may even accept a world government, giving it sufficient power to maintain peace. In this way, our position will be determined, and the currently unbearable worries can come to an end.

### Greece Today: Resisting Communism with All Its Might; Border Areas Engulfed in Gunfire; Facing Three Major Difficulties

— Translated by Xi from "World Report Weekly"

With the support of Britain and the United States, the Greek government is struggling to maintain its position as the last non-communist country in Eastern Europe. The turbulent political situation at home has deepened the suffering of the Greek people. Greece is the only victorious country still occupied by foreign troops. Greece's economic recovery is slower than that of other European countries, and it relies on external economic assistance to survive. The conservative government, in order to deal with the communists, has neglected the people's freedom.

Fundamentally, Greece faces three major problems: (1) national unity, (2) economic recovery, and (3) relations with Eastern and Western Europe.

The Problem of Unity

Greece showed a degree of unity in the short period of 1940-41. King George II did not promote the power of national unity. The King was not popular in the country. He was in power for the first time for a year, and resigned due to suspicion of involvement in the mutiny case. In 1935, he was restored to the throne by the victory of a referendum presided over by the right wing. After Greece was defeated in World War II, the King fled again. On September 1st of this year, a referendum voted 75% in favor of restoration, and he returned to the country for the first time and was restored to the throne. Today, Greek leftists accuse the King of not encouraging the anti-Japanese war group led by the Communist Party during the German occupation, and of supporting the Greek government controlled by the Conservative Party.

The Communist Party, the mainstay of the left-wing united front, has also not been helpful to national unity. The Communist Party led the anti-Nazi underground work during the German occupation, which was indeed remarkable, but it was despised by the majority of Greek nationals because of its hostility towards non-communist resistance groups and its abuse of violence against compatriots who did not join the left wing.

Since the liberation of Greece in October 1944, the Communist Party has lost power. When British and Greek troops drove the German army out, the Communist Party actually controlled Greece, but joined the united government recognized by Britain. In 1944, civil war broke out due to a dispute between the left-wing united front and the Greek right-wing group and British Commander Scobie. The Greek government, with Scobie's support, refused to replace the right-wing prime minister with a neutral person. The left wing convened a mass meeting in Athens to show resistance. The masses and the police exchanged gunfire, and the internal chaos intensified from then on.

British Prime Minister Churchill and Foreign Secretary Eden flew to Athens on Christmas 1944 to mediate the Greek civil war. They persuaded the Greek exiled king to appoint Archbishop Damaskinos as regent and to appoint an anti-imperial figure who had lived abroad for many years as the Greek Prime Minister. However, the British and Greek government troops continued to pursue the left-wing troops, forcing them to the northern border until a ceasefire agreement was signed. On February 12, 1945, a ceasefire agreement was established in Varkiza, stipulating that the Communist army should immediately surrender its weapons, and that the Communist Party and the left-wing united front should have legal status, and that elections and referendums should be held within a year to determine the Greek political system.

The election was finally held on March 31, 1946, but the left wing refused to vote, accusing the Greek government under British control of intimidating voters and not allowing them to vote freely. However, people from Britain, the United States, France and other countries believed that the election was fair and impartial, and the British occupation army did not interfere, and the left wing's abstention did not affect the election results.

The current Greece is the world of royalists. Most of the people in Greece are small farmers. 96% of the farmland is less than 25 acres, and most of it is less than 10 acres. The royalists used the farmers' fear of communism, telling them that the republic would turn their country into a puppet regime of the Soviet Union. At the same time, the Communist Party continued to use violence against political enemies, which invisibly promoted this anti-communist propaganda. In such an environment, the victory of the Greek royalists in the referendum on September 1 this year was an inevitable result.

Economic Recovery

The referendum cannot solve the problem of Greece's post-war recovery. Greece is a very poor country and relies on the relief from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to survive. By the end of this year, UNRRA will have provided Greece with US$358 million worth of goods, half of which is food. 60% of Greece's food supply relies on UNRRA. Apart from UNRRA's relief supplies, there are almost no other imports. At least half of the government's revenue comes from selling relief supplies to the public. The Greek government is concerned that UNRRA's agency will end at the end of this year, so it is looking for a way out and wants to borrow 150 million US dollars from the Export-Import Bank and hopes to get British aid. However, if UNRRA Director LaGuardia's proposal to cancel UNRRA becomes a reality, then Greece will inevitably face another difficult year.

Greece has recovered somewhat from the collapse of its wartime economy. Agricultural production has reached several percent of peacetime, and may reach pre-war levels next year. Industrial production is nearly 50% of what it was before the war. But Greece has never been self-sufficient, and a large number of imports are still necessary.

Greece's export industry has not been able to develop due to slow economic recovery. Before the war, Greece's exports were mainly tobacco, olives, and grapes, most of which were imported to Germany. At present, Britain and the United States are buying large quantities of Greek tobacco, but Greece must seek new outlets to fully restore the sales of tobacco and other products. Greek merchant ships lost three-quarters of their number in the war, giving a serious blow to Greek finances.

These economic difficulties are enough to affect the political trends. Observers believe that Greece, on the verge of starvation, is in danger of being forced onto the path of communism. Therefore, the British and American authorities regard the Greek economic recovery problem as more important than the political stability problem. They feel that after the former is solved, the latter can be easily solved.

Relations with Europe

In addition to domestic affairs and economic problems, Greece's relations with Europe are also a thorny issue. The Greeks used active underground warfare to drive Mussolini's invading troops back to Albanian territory, preventing the German army from invading and containing several divisions of the German army. Therefore, Greece hopes to gain the sympathy of the United Nations and demand compensation from Italy and Bulgaria, cede a piece of land in southern Albania, i.e., Northern Epirus, and strengthen the Greek-Bulgarian border.

But on the contrary, Bulgaria, which helped the Germans occupy Greece, asked the Paris Peace Conference for an outlet to the Aegean Sea through Greece under the encouragement of the Soviet Union and refused to pay reparations. At the same time, Albania hopes that the Soviet Union will support her in maintaining her claim to Northern Epirus. In addition, the Soviet Union group in the Paris Peace Conference accused Greece of making territorial demands that could cause a new war.

Within Greece, the political views of the various parties are quite different. The Greek government and neutral parties fully support the demands of the royalists. The Communist Party initially adopted a moderate attitude, but after being severely criticized, finally put forward a request to revise the border. However, the Communist Party of Macedonia took the opposite view. The Greek right-wingers believe that the Greek and Bulgarian Communist Parties in Macedonia have close ties.

The fundamental problem of Greece is that her government is a right-wing government supported by the British army, and there is no second country of its kind in Eastern Europe under Soviet influence. Although the Greek royalists currently have the upper hand, the activities of the domestic Communist Party and the pressure from communist countries on its northern border are still the most serious problems in Greece today.

### U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Walter Bedell Smith: Important Mission, Influencing the World Situation

The improvement or deterioration of relations between the United States and the Soviet Union is indeed closely linked to the safety of the world. From this point, one can see the importance of the mission of U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, General Smith. When the Paris Peace Conference was convened, Smith was also summoned by U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes to attend and participate, which is another clear demonstration of the U.S. government's emphasis on the position of Ambassador to the Soviet Union. However, the reversal of U.S.-Soviet relations during the conference will make the Ambassador's future work more difficult, because since he presented his credentials in Moscow, what he has strived for is to promote the improvement of U.S.-Soviet relations and mutual understanding.

But this man, who once served as Chief of Staff to General Eisenhower, is not easily discouraged, because difficult work is simply commonplace for him. Smith's tenacity earned him the nickname "Bulldog" from Churchill. His experience in World War II was a series of difficult tasks. From the landing in North Africa to the victory over Germany, no task was easy, and he completed them all.

Patience and Candor

Smith is a pragmatist, and he felt from the beginning that patience, time, and candid discussions were necessary for the success of his mission to the Soviet Union. There were varying opinions as to whether Smith was suitable for the position of Ambassador to the Soviet Union. The general consensus was that he had learned how to get along with the Soviets in the school of war. In addition, the Soviet Union has always looked at soldiers with outstanding military achievements in a different light, and Smith's reputation is enough to meet this requirement.

But this opinion is actually secondary. What should be emphasized more is that Smith has always been known for being straightforward and not fond of subtle diplomatic rhetoric, which is to Moscow's liking. In addition, Smith also has the ability to describe things very clearly and in detail, which is an indispensable element for a diplomat responsible for reporting the situation of another country to his own government. Smith's past experience is also outstanding. When he served as Chief of Staff of the Western countries, he had a very clear understanding of the political and military situation of the world during the war, and he had extensive contact with generals from the United States, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and the Soviet Union, earning him the title of military diplomat. His colleagues often called him "General Manager of the War," and General Eisenhower considered him "the best of all chiefs of staff."

Glorious Deeds

While serving as Chief of Staff, Smith planned the detailed military strategies for the landing in Europe and the direct assault on the heart of Germany. He represented General Eisenhower in signing the unconditional surrender documents of Germany and Italy.

Smith is sturdily built, with the appearance of an athlete, and his brown hair is already a bit gray. He speaks concisely and accurately, and occasionally gets angry, but always with restraint. When necessary, he can be cold and ruthless, but usually, he is full of warm sympathy. There are few anecdotes about this military diplomat, but those who have worked with him in the military know that he has a peptic ulcer, so when he is a little more irritable, people always diagnose him and say that his stomach problem is acting up again. What role this stomach problem plays in diplomacy is, of course, impossible to say, but sometimes it is a good excuse to avoid the constant toasting and drinking at Soviet banquets. Smith is not very interested in social activities, but he is very knowledgeable about chess and bridge. He is used to handling heavy military work, so he finds these small games easy to handle, and his opponents have a hard time dealing with him. His wife, a tall, gentle woman, accompanied him to Moscow. She is not willing to show her face in public and prefers to let her husband represent everything in the family.

Impressions of the Soviet Union

Smith's impressions of his months in the Soviet Union are as follows: "The Soviet people are extremely practical people. They suffered deeply during the war years, so they are not emotional when it comes to their country's important interests. They are not willing to easily sign important agreements..."

When he returns to Moscow after the end of the Paris Peace Conference, due to the international environment, his mission will obviously be more arduous and critical than before.

Current Affairs Commentary

### A Review of the German Question

— Chu Yukun

France Worried about Germany's Revival

The Four Foreign Ministers are meeting in New York, and the most important task, in addition to passing the draft of the Five-Power Treaty decided by the Paris Peace Conference, is the most thorny issue, the German question. This is the core of European politics, which needs to be resolved urgently and without delay. The Four Foreign Ministers' Conference should have discussed it long ago, but the results of the French general election made the French political situation completely questionable, so interim President, Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Bidault could not leave Paris even a step, waiting for the development of the French political situation. France insisted that before the French Foreign Minister arrived in New York, the Foreign Ministers' Conference could only discuss this issue in general terms and could not make any decisions. Therefore, since the opening of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference in New York, the German question has not been formally discussed.

Bevin Plan Has Six Key Points

But on the British side, a plan for the solution of the German question has long been drafted and will be submitted by Foreign Secretary Bevin to the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference. It is said that the content has six key points: (1) Britain advocates that Germany should be unified politically and economically in accordance with a system that is neither centralized nor federal. (2) Britain believes that the German production volume stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement is still insufficient; therefore, Germany should be allowed to produce 11 million tons of steel annually, and the cash obtained should be used to purchase food; (3) Under the current reparations plan, Britain objects to either the Soviet Union or Western countries removing any industrial equipment from Germany, even if the Soviet Union proposes to retain it in installments. Britain cannot agree. Only when German production increases enough to supply the occupation expenses and provisions of the Allied forces can Britain abandon this view; (4) Britain is willing to merge the British and American occupation zones, but is unwilling to establish an agreement that allows the Soviet Union to remove industrial equipment from Germany as reparations during the period when Germany relies on British subsidies; (5) Britain is still willing to invite the Soviet Union to participate in the management of the Ruhr area's industry within the unified German institutions; (6) Britain intends to propose to prepare to organize a German central mechanism, establish a central civil service corps, which can appoint local government agencies, and have the power to make decisions politically, but ultimately must be approved by the authorities of the occupying countries.

France Anxious about German Revival

France's attitude towards the German question is roughly the same as after the last war; what France seeks day and night is France's security, and what it worries about all the time is Germany's recovery. Recently, French Ambassador to the United States Bonnet also spoke about this in a speech to the French Chamber of Commerce. At present, France is certainly not satisfied with the situation in the Soviet occupation zone of Germany, and it cannot agree with the economic merger of the British and American occupation zones, especially the fact that Britain supplies Germany with more coal from the Ruhr area than it supplies France, which has caused unanimous dissatisfaction among the French government and people. Although the foreign policy of the Bidault government maintains a detached attitude, neither approving of Soviet communism nor satisfied with British and American imperialism, in fact, it inevitably leans somewhat towards the British and American sides. But after the Communist Party came to power, the direction of French foreign policy was even more valued by the world. Communist Party leader Thorez also said that France's foreign policy is to prevent Germany from attempting to rearm itself or to control the European continent economically.

UN General Assembly Work Progresses Slowly

The United Nations General Assembly passed Egypt's proposal on the 19th, asking governments of all countries to "immediately stop religious and racial discrimination." Although there are no concrete measures, the advocacy of national equality is worth our attention. The General Assembly concentrated on discussing the issue of investigating foreign troops stationed in various countries this week. Representatives of the five countries of China, Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union successively made speeches, explaining the views of various countries. Molotov took the opportunity to expand on the topic, demanding that the U.S. military withdraw from China and demanding that the British military withdraw from Greece. Therefore, this issue has become the focus of contention between the United States and the Soviet Union. Although Britain proposed a compromise plan, it still failed to gain the approval of both the United States and the Soviet Union. How this issue can be resolved is really a major test for the United Nations General Assembly. (November 25th)

Spring and Autumn

### Wine

— Ye Cao

With the country's recovery, we are also recovering. Carrying simple luggage, from the mountain city that served as the base of the Anti-Japanese War, to Shanghai, where we had lived for more than 20 years and had been away for nine years.

On the night of August 13th, because we went to pick up our fourth uncle, who was ill in the Wuxi Huishan Sanatorium, we got on the train at the South Station, transferred to Suzhou via Jiaxing, and met with our third brother, Xia Guang, in Wuxi. The short journey took nearly three days. I really don't want to try that kind of crowded suffering a second time in my life. Back in Suzhou, we stayed at my third brother's house, and my French sister-in-law treated us very well. We waited for the train back to Shanghai.

In Suzhou, we saw large groups of enemy planes dive-bombing for the first time, in a terrifying night of intense strafing! At that time, no one knew how to fear, and we watched the planes come and go, and the explosions of anti-aircraft artillery shells. Several bridges were blown up, and the train between Suzhou and Shanghai was blocked. After discussing it, we decided to return to our hometown and join the Anti-Japanese War camp.

In these nine years, we ran to Luoyang, Chongqing, Xi'an, and the mountainous Lihuang. There was hardly a year that we didn't flee. Our home was destroyed and rebuilt. We were constantly oppressed by death and tormented by life every day. However, we lived with great energy, optimistically and conscientiously. The tenacity of life has never been greater. My third uncle's family was bombed to death, and we were not sad at all. We held a simple funeral for him. We only knew that we wanted revenge, and we were determined to drive the Japanese devils out of the country. We only had one belief, that the Japanese devils would be driven away sooner or later. We only had one ideal, that we would have a way to deal with things after the victory. Returning to Shanghai, our second hometown, we lived in a relatively spacious house, bought more than 100 bundles of manuscript paper, and wrote about our bitter experiences, supporting ourselves with labor.

We finally won the victory, and we also returned to Shanghai. But the house was occupied by a friend, and the friend didn't have the power to take over the house, so we had to let him live there. We ourselves had to borrow a friend's house and wait slowly.

Working in a newspaper office, the salary could originally support a family of five, but now, it's not enough for one person. No one knows how to live. My wife advised me to make a budget, but I smiled bitterly and advised her to save as much as possible. We have survived the last nine years by saving.

After 1941, our nutrition deteriorated year by year, and my wife and children were often ill all year round, which was frustrating. If we wanted to treat our illnesses, we couldn't think about living. Eating became a problem, so we had to let the illnesses be and talk about them later.

My wife complained, and the children cried constantly, for a long time, as if there would never be an end. At first, I comforted them a few words, but gradually, I became desperate; I was already hoarse and exhausted, and I no longer had the strength to save them. How long can they live? Only God knows!

I lost my ideal of life, but I had no way to transcend this state, and I couldn't help but live on; first of all, I had to settle myself down. What method could I use to make me not see, what method could I use to make me not hear? I learned to drink—the thing I hated most in my life!

Oh, wine, you are my good companion to dispel sorrow, but I am deeply afraid that you will lead me to destruction!

### Listening to the Farewell Performance of the Music Visiting Group

— Liang You Ting

Recently, music listeners in Shanghai have heard many farewell performances by famous musicians going abroad. From the solo concerts of Si Yigui, Lang Yuxiu, and Gao Zhilan, to the recent farewell performance of the Music Visiting Group, although there were mixed reviews, this is always a vigorous side of Shanghai's music scene.

Some people say that this is a flash in the pan for Shanghai's music scene, because they have all slipped away one by one, and in the future, Shanghai will have fewer and fewer musicians, except for the Municipal Symphony Orchestra and the Shanghai Music Society, which is still growing. However, we should always think positively: they probably don't want to not return, and at the same time, there are many relatively junior musicians in Shanghai who can take this opportunity to slowly improve their skills and status.

Therefore, this time we listened to the farewell performance of the Music Visiting Group, although we were filled with feelings of reluctance, we were also filled with a sense of celebration; because we hope that these people will go abroad to promote our musical skills first, and then bring back a rich harvest.

Returning to the topic, here we should talk about the "farewell songs" of the Music Visiting Group.

The five members of the Visiting Group, except for Mr. Yu Yizu, who was responsible for management, were all performers: Ma Sihong, Ma Sisun, Huang Yuanyin, and Wu Leyi. Among them, Ma Sihong's skills are recognized as those of a master. Everyone may still remember that in the era when the Public Works Bureau did not like the violin so much, he was the "star" of the symphony orchestra.

The first enchanting holiday—also as the overture to this performance—Ma Sihong played three pieces on the violin, all of which were Ma Sicong's proud masterpieces (Rhapsody, Nostalgia, Mongolian Dance); these pieces, especially Nostalgia, can often be heard in Ma Sihong's performance. This is a piece he plays naturally. He closed his eyes and let the "pentatonic" Eastern-style melody slowly float out of the strings, like a girl receiving a lover's passionate kiss. The expression of the performance and the appropriate performance content are equally appreciated. I often feel that in a concert, we not only appreciate the content of the music, but also appreciate the expression of the performers. If you have seen a film by the late Polish pianist Paderewski (who was once the President of Poland)—"Moonlight Sonata"—you should feel his attractive posture in front of the keyboard. In a successful performance, we see that when the performer gives all his life to the piece, it is really too touching!

Perhaps because the "fleshiness" of string music is easier to please, so is the case with the piano solo (Ms. Wu Leyi). Regarding that "combination of Chinese and Western" piece by He Luting—The Cowherd's Flute, I have the same feeling every time I hear it, that is: the piano is underutilized. The Cowherd's Flute is a good piece with Eastern beauty, but its overall structure does not seem to be very suitable for the piano. More precisely, it cannot express the grandeur of the piano.

Regarding Huang Yuanyin's tenor, I have a perhaps very superficial feeling: his volume is not as good as Wu Zhengqian's. In other words, Mr. Huang's volume is slightly smaller, which has been criticized by people when the Visiting Group performed in Beijing last time. The highest note of "How Can I Not Think of Him" is only F sharp raised by a semitone, which should be indifferent to a good tenor, but Mr. Huang feels strenuous. If we criticize Mr. Huang's solo in terms of timbre, volume, range, and expression, we can say this: there is more than enough expression, the range is not enough, the volume is small, and the timbre is quite round, but it is affected by the range not being wide enough, and the timbre is slightly not smooth enough in the highest notes.

There is also a bit of "nitpicking": "How Can I Not Think of Him" seems to be written by Liu Bannong, but both programs of the Visiting Group wrote it as "Hu Shi." I would like to deny it for Mr. Hu Shi.

### Jialing River Notes

— Zang Zan

A Little Bird

A foggy morning. This is a winter morning, and people expect the sun to appear, but because the sun will definitely appear, the fog becomes even more presumptuous, pouring into the window like coal smoke—the window I opened to greet the sun—along with the fog, there is the river wind from the Jialing River, cold and suffocating.

I was reading a short story by Azolin called "Moth" in bed, and I was surprised by that poor life; why does this generation bury itself in the fire, and the next generation still rushes to the fire!

At this moment, suddenly something rushed into my small room, hit the wall and fell down, falling into the spittoon at the head of the bed... By the time I recognized it as a small bird; the bird was already motionless.

I was afraid it would die, but I thought it was unlikely. Immediately, I got out of bed, moved the spittoon to the corridor, poured out the water, and poured out the seemingly dead bird as well.

I have always known too little about birds. This is a bird a little bigger than a sparrow, a small bird with just fully grown feathers. I thought this must be a bird of the eagle family, if it grew up.

At this time, the bird was lying on the ground, covered with cold water, and not fluttering its wings, but it was indeed not dead. It seemed to be trembling, and one eye would open and close from time to time, looking very strenuous, while the other eye was bleeding. Between the eyelid and the eyeball, there was a feather inserted, obviously from a fight.

The fog came even thicker. I hurriedly put on the quilt. The river was a vast expanse of white light. The boats had stopped sailing. It was very lonely and calm, so quiet that there was no sound.

I looked back at the dying little bird and felt that there was only a little hope if I moved it into the house. Although there was no stove in the house, it could at least make it warmer... But unexpectedly, just as I reached out to catch it, it tried to flap its wings. —It actually struggled to fly up, splashing me with dirty water. Just as I was helpless and almost angry with it, it crashed into the wall again and fell down. I quickly went to catch it again. This time, it didn't treat the white wall as the sky again. It flew over the railing and flew out of the corridor...

Outside the corridor was a vast expanse of fog, emitting a white light.

Immediately, I realized that this bird was too weak to fly far, and it would definitely fall into the river under the fog; even any healthy bird could not fly across the river surface.

But the bird flew away. It just glided down, and tried its best to rush upward, but after rising a little, it glided down again...

I watched it flying hard, flying, flying towards the brightest place, until the white light of the fog completely covered it.

…!

The sun never came out that day.

This little bird and the moth are always entangled with me.

### Unfortunate Woman

— By Sherwood Anderson, Translated by Wang Rui

A woman from Iowa came to Chicago and booked a room in West Side Apartments. She was about twenty-seven years old. It was said that she came to this metropolis to study music teaching methods.

A young man also lodged in West Side Apartments. The door of his room faced a long, wide living room on the second floor. Across the living room was the woman's room, with the door directly opposite the young man's.

Speaking of this young man, he was gentle by nature. He was a painter named Lyle, but I always thought he would be more suitable as a writer. He was a great conversationalist with strong comprehension, but his painting was not particularly outstanding.

The woman who lived in the room across the hall always left early and returned late every day. Her appearance was similar to the women who came and went on the streets every day. The only difference was that she had a slight limp. Her right leg was deformed from birth, causing her to walk with a limp. She lived in the apartment for three months – she was the only female guest in the apartment besides the landlady – and gradually the men in the apartment began to notice her.

The men only talked about one thing concerning her. When they met in the hallway of the living room, they would stop in front of her door, smile, and whisper. "She needs a lover," they would say, making a funny face. "She may not think about it, but what she really needs is a lover." Old Chicagoans and Chicago men always thought this kind of thing was easy to achieve. When my friend, the young Lyle, told me this story, I laughed, but he remained expressionless. He shook his head. "Things are not that easy," he said. "If it were that simple, writers would have nothing to write about."

Lyle also explained, "Whenever a man approached her, she became frightened." They invited her to dinner, to the theater, but they could not entice her to walk side by side with a man on 通　Street. She never went out at night. When a man stopped in the hallway of the living room to try to talk to her, she would initially lower her eyes to the ground, and then quickly run into her own room. A young dry goods merchant once encouraged her to sit with him on the stone steps in front of the apartment building to talk.

He was an enthusiastic young man. When he took her hand, she cried out strangely. He panicked and stood up, gently touching her shoulder in an attempt to explain, but she was so frightened that she trembled all over. "Don't touch me," she cried, "Don't let your hand touch me!" As she screamed, people strolling on the street stopped to watch. The dry goods merchant hurried upstairs, entered his room, closed the door, and held his breath to listen to the commotion outside. When people questioned him, he said in a trembling voice, "This is really a prank. I didn't offend her. She deliberately made trouble for me. I didn't do anything indecent to her. This is really unexpected. I just touched her arm with my finger, what's the big deal?"

Lyle probably told me the story of this Iowa woman more than ten times. The men in the apartment then began to dislike her. Although she did not expect anything from them, she never wanted them to be alone. She continued to interact with single men, and she always protested loudly when they touched her. This trick was performed at least a hundred times. When she took a nude bath in the bathroom facing the living room, she always left the bathroom door ajar, regardless of how many men passed by. In the first-floor sitting room, when people were sitting on the sofa chatting, she would silently sit down facing them. She leaned on the sofa, her lips slightly parted, her eyes gazing at the ceiling. Her whole life seemed to be waiting for good fortune to come. Everyone knew when she was in the room, but the men standing there pretended not to see her. They chatted and laughed loudly. When everyone was tired and had nothing to say, they would leave quietly, one by one, one after another.

One evening, the landlady evicted this unfortunate woman. Someone, perhaps the dry goods merchant, had told the landlady something, and she immediately obeyed. "It would be better if you left tonight." Lyle heard the landlady say this. She stood in front of the Iowa woman's room, and the landlady's eviction notice echoed throughout the apartment.

The tall and thin painter Lyle would fight for his ideals with his whole life. The passion in his soul completely sublimated the desire for sex. His income was small, and he had not yet married. Perhaps he had never had a lover. It was not that he had no carnal desires, but he did not consider carnal desires to be the most important thing in life.

On the night the Iowa woman was evicted from the West Side apartment, she went into Lyle's room after waiting for the landlady to go downstairs. It was about eight o'clock in the evening, and he was reading a book by the window. She did not knock on the door before opening it. She didn't say a word, but rushed to Lyle and knelt down. Lyle said that her twisted leg made her run like an injured bird, her eyes were burning, and she was breathing rapidly. "Embrace me," she said, leaning her face against his knees, trembling all over. "Embrace me quickly. I should be married at this age. I can't wait any longer, you should possess me immediately."

Of course, you can imagine how embarrassed Lyle was at this time. According to what he told me, he had been indifferent to the woman until the night the tragedy of the proposal was staged. However, I think that among all the men living in the apartment, he was the one who could treat her more impartially. Then, the situation in the room gradually escalated. The landlady broke into Lyle's room, and now two women were in front of him, the stronger casting a predatory gaze on the weaker. The Iowa woman knelt trembling, almost shrinking into a ball at his feet. Lyle's heart was pounding. He had a whimsical idea and put his hand on the kneeling woman's shoulder, shaking her violently. "Don't worry now," he said quickly, "I will definitely keep my promise." Then he turned to the landlady and smiled: "We are engaged," just waiting for the wedding to take place. We all had an argument. She knelt into my room and snuggled up to me. She is not in good health and is very emotionally agitated. I'm going to take her away. Please don't worry. I'll take her away."

After the woman and Lyle left the apartment, she took his hand and stopped crying. The fear she had felt when she was with single men also disappeared. He found her a room in another apartment, and then accompanied her to the park and sat on a bench. They talked until twelve o'clock at night. He and she had met and talked many times before. It seemed that there was no progress in their relationship. She went back, and I guess she probably quietly returned to her hometown in Iowa!

### An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 105

— By Ye Jingfeng

At this moment, the music on the stage suddenly stopped, and the lights became brighter. The couples on the dance floor also returned to their seats. This made it somewhat difficult for both Hejian to handle the situation. Coincidentally, at this moment, the leader's aide came up and reported that Hejian's driver was waiting in the hall. This broke the stalemate. Hejian performed the usual "sorry" social scene, temporarily excused himself, but left the cigarette behind to represent himself, so as not to make her feel too lonely.

This chauffeur was Hejian's subordinate, 29 years old, a mixed-race Japanese and 高　. He was also quite handsome, calm and resourceful. In official matters, he was number one hundred and eight, but someone gave him a very inappropriate nickname, calling him "Wild Boar".

"Wild Boar, you came at the perfect time," Hejian said quietly, appearing as if he were instructing his driver. "You are an encyclopedia when it comes to Tokyo. Quickly find a way to sneak into the dance hall. In the dark corner diagonally opposite the dance floor on the left side of the door is my seat. There is a woman dressed in a 服 suit; I want to know something about her. Go quickly... Come back here to find me."

Hejian passed through an arched doorway, bought a cigar at the bar, made a few phone calls in the telephone room, and returned to the hall, where Wild Boar was already waiting.

"Do you recognize her?" Hejian asked.

"I've never seen her before."

"Oh...?!"

"According to Little Line's report, she has never been here, but she performed a solo at the Navy Club's Naval and Marine Corps Gala last month. Her name is Pingzi. She went to England for three years. Her English name is Louie, and she has a Chinese name, Liu Shi, because she rarely admires Chinese ancient poetry. Her father was a government official, Lieutenant Colonel Nakamura, who served as the First Secretary of the British Embassy six years ago for four years. They have one son and one daughter; the son is also a government official, currently serving in Hiroshima, a lieutenant instructor and staff officer of the regimental headquarters." "Little Line" is a code name in the Hejian Group, equivalent to informants.

"Very good! Pingzi, Louie, Liu Shi,...! She can sing, no wonder her voice is so pleasing to the ear; when she speaks, it's as crisp as the steel pipes in a symphony orchestra tinkling... But do you have any information about her activities?"

"Right now, she is probably a special member of the Black Dragon Society...! But I can't be sure." Special members are not subject to five-level testing, but their relatives must have had historical ties with the society.

"That's right...! Thank you for your hard work. There are six friends waiting for us outside. I can't handle them myself. I've already instructed 十二　to come and take care of them on the phone. You park the car in a convenient location, I might have to leave soon."

Hejian re-entered the dance floor, and the music was playing "Guan Shan Night Moon," which swept the entire Three Islands, a three-part song that explained a young love affair from "Lover in a Dream" to "Suicide Pact". The melody was soft and serene, soul-stirring, and was also an imitation of a Western waltz, but with a very strong Japanese flavor. The lighting in the entire venue was more gentle than the tango just now.

"I'm sorry," Hejian apologized to Pingzi with a nod and a bow, "I was giving a few words to the driver, and I also made two phone calls, and I was delayed for so long, it's really rude."

### Postage

— By Shaofu

The publishing industry has never had good days. I wonder if those who criticize the poverty of the Chinese publishing industry have deeply understood the difficulties and hardships involved. It is really a big question.

Printing costs are a heavy burden that makes publishers breathless. May I ask if the fees for two thousand words can barely cover the typesetting costs for one thousand words? Selling knowledge is so cheap. We really must cry out in unison, "Civilization has been swept away." Fortunately, paper prices are not yet expensive, allowing everyone to relax a little. However, at this very moment, postage has soared, suddenly increasing fourfold. This is too big of a blow to the entire publishing industry.

An ordinary magazine, priced at eight hundred yuan, would cost the same amount to mail from Shanghai to Beijing or Xi'an by air. How can readers bear such a burden! Some people say, why send it by air? The answer is very simple. Leaving aside many places that can only be reached by air, even if there are other means of transportation, with the post office's mountain of accumulated packages and various obstacles on land and water routes, it may take two months to travel from Shanghai to Xi'an. May I ask, what reason do readers in Xi'an have to read a magazine from two months ago? If it is a daily newspaper, it is even worse!

This blow is tantamount to strangling the circulation of culture. For the sake of popularizing knowledge, we should appeal to the authorities and request special treatment for publications. Publications should be an exception to this postage increase.

### The Achievements of Lazy People

— Translated by Jia Jing

(Editor's note: The article below only illustrates a human psychology of seeking convenience and progress, which is obviously different from true laziness like "parasitic plants". True laziness is anti-progressive!)

First of all, let me declare: I am not a person who advocates laziness. Since we were young, we have been accustomed to hearing our elders tell us stories of lazy people. They all believe that laziness is despicable and believe that lazy people will never develop. However, the following article says that most of the evolution of mankind depends on lazy people. This is a wonderful argument. I would like to present it to readers:

(1) It is an obvious fact that women's youth always fades earlier than men's. Undoubtedly, this is because women in ordinary social classes are more industrious than their husbands. They are willing to do habitual labor instead of intellectual ease.

(2) In restaurants, lazy waiters are often the most satisfactory. They bring out everything the customer needs at once, saving the customer from having to call them repeatedly. Diligent waiters sometimes bring coffee but forget the sugar or forget the spoon. They would rather run back and forth, and by the time everything is complete, the coffee is cold!

Human evolution

(3) The evolution of mankind has almost all been successfully planned by lazy people in order to save a certain step. In ancient times, humans lived in caves. When they were thirsty, they had to walk a long way to find spring water to drink. However, lazier people came up with a way to bring a large amount of water home in buckets. Later, they used bamboo pipes to connect the spring to their homes. Later, they invented water pumps.

More than a hundred years ago, a boy named Humphrey Potter was hired to sit next to a steam engine and manage the exhaust gas discharged by each stroke. Later, after a long time, he became bored with the work, so he used ropes and doors to connect, so that the valve would open and close automatically. Not only was it less labor-intensive, but the work efficiency increased by more than double. From his laziness, he unintentionally invented the principle of the reciprocating valve.

(4) Great engineer and life guidance expert E.B. GilPrath often loved to screen films of skilled workers in various professional departments to determine how many movements were required to complete a job. He found that lazy workers do not waste a single simple movement, while diligent workers do not pay attention to wasting many unnecessary movements. As a result, lazy workers are more efficient than diligent workers.

(5) Lazy people never waste precious time dreaming about the dynamics of daily life. They often sit there quietly waiting for a more intelligent idea to come.

The best books are mostly products of lazy writers. If the writer is too diligent, he will eagerly desire the completion of the work day and night, and he will always feel that there are too many unsatisfactory places, so he must revise it again and again! He always hopes for excellent sentence patterns and excellent plots to appear.

I am not alone

(6) Intellectual laziness also benefits in the same way. Many proverbs and formulas are set by lazy people to replace their brains. If there were no law of falling bodies, how could we determine when an apple falls from a tree and two small balls, one thrown straight up and the other thrown later, will meet?

Lazy people say: "I am not alone!"

### One House on Fire, Ten Thousand Suffer

— By Suobei

One house on fire, ten thousand suffer; fire-fighting equipment must be strengthened; strengthening equipment is not a fundamental solution; fire prevention campaign must be publicized! Bending the chimney and moving the firewood is the smartest; burning your head and scorching your forehead is futile! All Shanghai citizens should pay attention to preventing arson in dry and windy weather!

### Suicide

— By Jinlu

According to statistics released by the police department's statistical office, a total of 839 suicide cases have occurred in this city from January to 卞 month of this year. Women accounted for 491, and men 348. Family disputes were the most common cause of suicide. In terms of educational level of suicide victims, those with primary education and those who were illiterate ranked first.

Looking at the above table analysis statistics, we can estimate that an average of five and a half people commit suicide every two days in this city. We can also find a trend in it, that is, the higher the level of education, the less suicide tricks are played. What is most noteworthy is the cause of suicide: family disputes rank first; and women are more likely than men. "It is difficult for an honest official to judge family affairs." In our country in this transitional period, which is not old or new, family disputes are indeed a difficult problem to solve.

Now, let me make a realistic analysis of the causes of family disputes: the first is "no money". It is indeed not easy to live in this society where the weak are prey to the strong, there is little rice and many sacrifices, and everyone is fighting for food. Businesses that make money are not necessarily difficult, but businesses that are difficult are not necessarily profitable. At this time of rising prices, once the husband loses his job, "husband and wife" cannot escape "firewood and rice", and "love" cannot be eaten as "food". For the sake of firewood and rice, quarrels between husband and wife arise from time to time, and tragedy takes root at this time. The second is "too much money". Some men can be the best husbands in the world when they have no money, but once they have some stinky money, they are like runaway horses, spending time and drinking outside, throwing dice and shouting, and throwing the long-suffering wife out of the sky. When the wife is angry and cannot find a way for her husband to make money again, tragedy occurs.

The above two reasons are analyzed based on the fact that most of the suicide victims are engaged in family services and are unemployed. The reasons are one and two, two and one, coming and going, it is still for the sake of money. To be honest, most of the disputes in the family are caused by this "Adu object".

But the problem is not with money itself. In a word: it depends on how you handle money!

### Post Talk: Who Doesn't Need Stamps Who Invented Stamps

— By Kong Zhen

In this world, who can avoid contact with relatives and friends except Robinson Crusoe! So, doesn't the transmission of letters depend on that small stamp? In other words, everyone needs stamps except Robinson Crusoe.

The value of stamps has been determined, and they are indispensable in our daily lives; so it is worth studying.

Story

There are many legends about the origin of stamps: one is said to be the most reliable and a very "romantic" story; in England there was a girl who was extremely beautiful, so many people pursued her, and she received many love letters from all over the world every day. At that time, the postage was paid by the recipient. She received too many boring letters of this kind, and she couldn't afford it; so she began to refuse to receive letters. Suddenly, the post office (maybe it had another name) was in trouble; later, they changed their method to have the sender pay the postage.

The shape of the stamps is not fixed, long, square, round, triangular, as long as you can think of it. The colors are even more colorful. If you have time to casually visit that stamp company, it is always "a dazzling array".

Our Chinese stamps are relatively monotonous. Except for the long ones, they are square, and almost all of them are printed with the posthumous portrait of the Founding Father.

Function

Stamps also have a major function, which is commemorative stamps. Issuing a special stamp to commemorate someone or something has great significance both in practice and in appearance. Like the two sets of commemorative stamps we have recently seen, celebrating President Jiang's birthday and celebrating the opening of the National Assembly. Commemorative stamps are issued even more in other countries. Many countries have printed commemorative stamps of US President Roosevelt. Isn't this another function of promoting diplomatic relations?

San Marino, a small country in Italy, is even more interesting: one of the main sources of income for their country is issuing various commemorative stamps. Before our postage increase this time, it was said that the post office was losing money badly. I don't understand why it wouldn't print two sets of commemorative stamps. Could it be said that that would be detrimental to the demeanor of a great power? The reason why issuing commemorative stamps has become a source of income is due to the purchase of stamp collectors.

Stamps that violate the law are more valuable, commemorative stamps issued before the Northern Expedition by Zhang Zuolin, who called himself the Grand Marshal of the Navy and Army, stamps issued by the Communist Party before the war, and stamps from the enemy puppet era "returning the capital", "air defense", etc. are all valuable.

Stamp collecting

The hobby of stamp collecting is quite common in the world and in China. It is not only an art, but also a course in history and geography. Close your eyes and think about it. A hundred years later, a child holds a set of commemorative stamps for President Jiang's sixtieth birthday. Doesn't he have an impression of such a great man in his mind? Isn't it more effective than his books?

### No Smoking

— By Cai Lin

The walls of movie theaters, theaters, and stages are all posted with six conspicuous characters "Prohibition of Smoking".

This is probably still useless, so "Instructions" are printed with "Prohibition of Smoking" again.

Before the movie starts, a warning "Prohibition of Smoking" is also projected on the screen.

These, when 伊　介 case, smoking freely, still enjoying themselves狂 sucking.

Because the windows in the movie theater are tightly closed and the air does not circulate, the smoke cannot dissipate, and the strong smell makes non-smokers suffer from headaches and dizziness.

This group of people who destroy the "Prohibition of Smoking" are all intellectuals, and they all have a good "appearance", because they rely on their "good appearance" to have this "courage".

As a result, many gazes that dare to be angry but dare not speak are constantly focused on this smoker, implying "Swine! Don't you know how to read..."

Without even this basic sense of "public morality", how can China not be a mess? Understated

### Six Roots Not Clean

— By Xiaoseng

Jing'an Temple is a famous temple at sea, and precisely because it is a "famous temple", after De Wu and Mi Jia were reported, "Six Roots" invited dozens of Dharma protectors and benefactors to sign a petition and return to the temple. The Buddhist sect has many affairs, which really makes people feel "six roots not clean"!

### Is there a legacy of evil

— By Ye Cao

The power saving campaign has entered a serious stage, and all households have received the "ultimatum" book of "disconnection if the limit is violated"; therefore, there is a wave of complaints, and everyone says: "What is the difference between this and the era of enemy puppet rule?" "Enemy puppet politics" is actually used as a "balance" to compare with reality. I wonder if this is what we often call "legacy of evil?"

### Sighing Sound

— By Sui

On the day of Yu Qia's coffin, two "Bai Xiang" type strong men sighed incessantly on the side of the road. One said: "When he came to Shanghai, he was about the same as us, only four horns of foreign money", and the other pointed to the ceremonial pavilion and said "People rely on these two words to get out!" The pavilion inside is the word "Qincheng", this scene can be written into a novel.

### Treatment Issues?

— By Ye Cao

Jiangwan police officer Shi Gongwei was detained and fined for privately accepting a bribe of 50,000 yuan from a smoker. The implementation of the prohibition policy has been several months, but the atmosphere of poison has not subsided slightly. The reason for this is only this. For all government orders that cannot be completed from beginning to end, we can all view them in this way. I heard that the adjustment of police officer treatment has been approved by the authorities, and we hope that it will not become a rumor.

News Personality

### Leader of the Democratic Socialist Party: Zhang Junmai

— Mi Shan

Currently, Zhang Junmai is clearly a news figure attracting attention from all sides.

A few days ago, whether the Democratic Socialist Party under Zhang's leadership would participate in the National Assembly became the focus of general discussion and speculation. However, the "mystery" has finally been revealed. The Democratic Socialist Party ultimately nominated candidates to participate in the National Assembly. This naturally disappointed the Yan'an side.

Zhang's given name is Jiasen, Junmai is his courtesy name. He is the elder brother of the current Minister of Railways, Zhang Jia'ao. He is probably sixty years old this year. His ancestral home is Baoshan County, Jiangsu. He graduated from the Department of Political Science at Waseda University in Japan in 1909 and served as a compiler in the former Qing Dynasty Hanlin Academy. During the revolution, he served as the editor-in-chief of the Tianjin Jingjin Times. After the founding of the Republic of China, he served as a secretary in the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Later, he went to England and Germany to specialize in political science. After returning to China, he served as a Zhejiang negotiator for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Later, he resigned and came to Shanghai to serve as the general manager of the Shishi Xinbao newspaper. After that, he devoted himself to education, serving as the president of National Chengchi University and a professor at Soochow, Aurora, and Yenching Universities.

Mr. Zhang has made great contributions to the academic world. What is most unforgettable is that he made a big splash in the early years in the debate on "Women's Studies and Science." His more famous works include "A Record of the Social Democratic Political Situation in the New Germany" and "Draft for the Chinese Constitution."

Mr. Zhang founded his party in 1931, launching preparations for the "National Socialist Party." In 1932, he published the party platform, and in 1934 and 1936, he convened two representative congresses. Mr. Zhang was the general secretary of the party and fully responsible. His position is: on the one hand, he does not agree with the theory of "national supremacy," but he also believes that the state has its own importance; on the other hand, he is deeply afraid that the government representing the state will repeat the drawbacks of Western capitalist countries, so he advocates the development of socialism in order to avoid class struggle. For more than ten years, Mr. Zhang has appeared on the Chinese political stage as the leader of the party, and he has also made efforts on the anti-Japanese front.

Last November, Mr. Zhang went to the United States, where he held preliminary consultations with overseas democratic constitutional parties in Montreal. As a result, because "we are like-minded and have obtained the consent of both parents," they announced their union, resulting in the current Democratic Socialist Party, whose purpose is "to achieve socialism by democratic methods."

From journalist to scholar, from scholar to politician, these are the three stages of Zhang Junmai's life.
