### Yu Hongjun Attends the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee, Elaborating on Eight Financial Measures, Future Will Enter a Peacetime State

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 4th] The Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee held its third general meeting on the morning of the 4th. Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun delivered a report on financial issues, stating briefly: Today, I am reporting to the general meeting on financial matters. Detailed information about the work of the Ministry of Finance over the past nine months has already been compiled into a written report, submitted to the Executive Yuan for compilation and distribution. Now, I will only select the most important and concerning aspects for everyone to present a simple report. This report is divided into the following eight items: (1) Current central financial policy, (2) Improvement of the tax system, (3) Changes in materials control, (4) Financial control issues, (5) Stabilizing currency value, (6) Enriching local finances, (7) Balancing national treasury revenue and expenditure, (8) Rectifying the discipline of tax officials.

Current Central Financial Policy

1.  Current central financial policy. The convening of this meeting is approximately nine months from the First Plenary Session of the Central Committee. In the past nine months, there have been significant changes in both domestic and international situations, and the government's policies must naturally undergo various new decisions and implementations. Today's finance is in a transitional state from wartime finance supporting the war to peacetime finance for reconstruction, which is a financial policy centered on demobilization. The guidelines implemented by the Ministry in the past few months and to be followed in future plans are: 1. Improve the tax system to equalize the distribution of people's wealth and promote the development of domestic industries; 2. Allocate provincial and county tax revenues to enrich local finances, in order to promote economic construction and complete self-government; 3. Use international cooperation to stabilize exchange rates with gold, foreign exchange, and materials to stabilize currency value, thereby reducing the issuance of legal tender, guiding finance to productive avenues, and promoting the country's international trade; 4. Utilize enemy and puppet industries and the surplus economic power of the international community to supplement national financial resources and further balance national treasury revenue and expenditure. All of these are based on the various principles extracted and summarized from the various principles of the Party's program and policies passed sincerely by the entire congress. The various issues reported below are what the Ministry has implemented in accordance with these principles.

Improvement of the Tax System

2.  Improvement of the tax system. After the victory, national finance should gradually transition from wartime to peacetime. Our country's current tax system has mostly been reviewed and improved to meet the needs of future national construction. The objectives of improvement can be summarized into three main points: First, strive for simplification of the tax system; Second, coordinate with future economic construction; Third, utilize the tax system to improve the distribution of social wealth. After the victory, in terms of direct tax improvements, various exemptions for necessities have been adopted, and the new progressive tax rates have also been appropriately increased. On the one hand, the principle of "those with money contribute money" is implemented, and on the other hand, the burden on the poor is reduced. After this improvement of our country's tax system, it seems that with time and the development of production industries, direct taxes will be the main framework, supplemented by various commodity taxes, to complete a sound tax system.

Changes in Materials Control

3.  Changes in materials control. Before the victory, the types of materials controlled by our government were numerous. Those under the jurisdiction of the Ministry included the control of cotton yarn, the monopoly of salt, the taxation in kind of wheat flour and sugar, and the unified purchase and sale of tung oil, bristles, wool, tea, raw silk, etc. Now, all past methods have been changed, which on the one hand, can facilitate the flow of goods and benefit merchants and people, and on the other hand, can also promote production and increase tax revenue. Now, the control of cotton yarn has been abolished, the control of salt has also been abolished, and the taxation in kind part has been changed back to collecting tax payments. Regarding import and export materials originally controlled solely for wartime needs, they have been amended or abolished separately. (1) Abolish the regulations on blocking, prohibiting, and inspecting materials entering and exiting; (2) Abolish the unified purchase and sale methods for tung oil, bristles, wool, tea, raw silk, etc.; (3) Simplify the items of controlled materials. The Trade Commission, which was in charge of this business during the war, and its three affiliated companies have also been abolished one after another. Recently, the Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade have been announced and implemented.

Regarding Financial Control Issues

4.  Financial control issues. After the victory of the war, the first priority in financial policy is to improve the banking system so that various banks can operate in accordance with the law. The Ministry has drafted nine regulations, which have been approved by the Executive Yuan meeting and sent for completion of the legislative process. They will be implemented soon. In the future, various banks will have paths to follow in their operations, and the banking system will rely on this to be sound. The second is to manage banking operations. Now that the war of resistance has been won, the laws and regulations for managing banks should be appropriately relaxed to enable financial development to cultivate the economy. However, during this period of reconstruction and construction, the use of bank funds should focus on supporting productive industries. The Ministry should urge continued processing to improve the bank accounting system and promote the bill system to improve credit instruments, stabilize market interest rates, and develop the economy. Methods have been formulated for compliance. In the future, if transportation returns to normal, factories gradually resume work, and international routes are unblocked, so that the management of banking operations can proceed in coordination, then the Ministry's control over finance can show considerable results.

Stabilizing Currency Value and Enriching Finance

5.  Stabilizing currency value. The first is to open the foreign exchange market, the second is to reorganize enemy and puppet banknotes, and the third is to handle banknotes in Taiwan and the Northeast. As for the main points of the Central Bank's provisional measures for managing foreign exchange, they can be summarized into three: (1) Abolish official prices; (2) The Central Bank may supply or purchase foreign exchange at any time to stabilize the foreign exchange market, and gold can be handled in the same way; (3) All foreign exchange deposits must not be increased, and each depositor should sell the remaining balance to the Central Bank at the market price on the day no later than the end of September of this year.

6.  Enriching local finances. The Ministry of Finance, based on the Party's policy, pays attention to the improvement of autonomous finance at any time. After the victory, in order to plan for financial reconstruction, a plan has been drafted, which has been studied by the Financial Professional Committee and is now being submitted to the National Defense Council for instructions.

7.  Balancing national treasury revenue and expenditure. This year's war of resistance has ended. In the financial reconstruction plan, balancing national treasury revenue and expenditure is a prerequisite. Therefore, follow the following guidelines to carry out budget preparation. On the revenue side: (1) Aim to restore pre-war revenue; (2) Accurately estimate the relationship between tax rates, tax amounts, and prices; (3) Expand the scope of all possible revenue. On the expenditure side: (1) Seek a reasonable proportion of military expenditure as much as possible; (2) Effectively coordinate with post-war relief plans; (3) Tighten unnecessary expenditures.

Rectifying the Discipline of Tax Officials

8.  Rectifying the discipline of tax officials. In the past year, the Ministry has abolished a total of 610 affiliated institutions and 180,86 people at all levels. The purpose is to adjust operations, simplify institutions, and prepare for the initial stage of improving personnel and establishing systems. A comprehensive review is currently underway. In the future, the policy of employing personnel will be to start with examinations to prevent favoritism, conduct assessments to rectify the atmosphere, provide good treatment to attract talents, and strengthen guarantees to encourage long-term careers. On the negative side, the Ministry has always encouraged the reporting of corruption cases. All reported cases, whether anonymous or signed, are accepted, and those found to have illegal activities or proven corruption will be dealt with severely without any leniency to serve as a warning. Conclusion: The above is a general overview of the Ministry's measures on several important current financial issues. I hereby conduct a thorough review and provide a concise report to all comrades of the Congress.

[United Press, Beiping, 4th] U.S. Seventh Fleet Commander Admiral Kirk arrived in Beiping yesterday afternoon during his naval voyage to North China for a short visit. Before his flagship, the USS Estes, docked in Tanggu and arrived in Beiping, he visited Qingdao. It is widely believed that Admiral Kirk will travel from Beiping to Qinhuangdao.

The Soviet Union plans to establish a commercial representative office in Shanghai, and Japan will also exchange goods with us for a large amount of building materials. It is heard that a group of local bureaucratic capitalists in Kunming and Chongqing are entering the import and export industry in knightly fashion.

### Aircraft Damaged Yesterday, Foreign Reporters Change to Leave Changchun Today

[This newspaper, Changchun, 4th] The nine reporters are leaving Changchun by plane today, but shortly after the plane took off, a leak was discovered in the plane's fuel tank, so it landed back at the airport here. The fuel tank is being repaired, and they are scheduled to fly again on the 5th. When the plane was preparing to land, two Soviet fighter planes took off, and the people on the plane and those seeing them off were temporarily shocked. Three of the nine reporters changed to taking a train to Shenyang, and the remaining six are still waiting for the plane. In addition, there were four people from the Soviet diplomatic community who were scheduled to fly to Beiping today. They were taking the plane to Tianjin.

[This newspaper, Changchun, 3rd] Foreign reporters were originally scheduled to fly to Beiping on the 3rd, but the plane that came to Changchun today turned back to Beiping due to the bad weather here. It is reported that the plane did not crash. This morning, there were dark clouds all around here, and it snowed in the afternoon, and the ground and roofs were all white.

### Liang Han Cao Convenes a Symposium to Discuss the Purpose of Party and Government Reform

Implement Intra-Party Democracy and Eliminate Bureaucracy

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 4th] A symposium on the movement for party and government reform was held at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 4th at the venue of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee. More than a hundred members of the Central Committee attended, presided over by Liang Han Cao. He reported on the purpose of the movement for party and government reform: First, unite revolutionary comrades and implement intra-party democracy; Second, overthrow bureaucratic capital and implement the Principle of People's Livelihood; Third, eliminate bureaucracy and implement democratic politics; Fourth, promote national integrity and safeguard national sovereignty. As for the various speculations from the outside, they are all intentional slander and not worth refuting. Subsequently, Cheng Qian, He Chengjun, and Zhang Zhiben successively expressed their opinions, emphasizing the necessity of party and government reform. Zhang also said that the reform movement is actually a "restoration movement," that is, to restore the revolutionary spirit of the Kuomintang fifty years ago in order to realize the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution. The whole audience applauded warmly, and the meeting adjourned at 3:00 PM.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 3rd] After Ma, Zhang, and Zhou arrived in Bing, they listened to the group's report and held talks with the military and political leaders here until 10:00 PM without reaching an agreement. It is currently determined that the take-off time tomorrow (4th) will be delayed by one hour, and a meeting will be held again in the early morning.

### Financial, Economic, and Monetary Report Will Continue to Be Reviewed This Morning. Yesterday, Various Committee Members Spoke Mostly Advocating Increased Production

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 4th] Second Central Committee

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 4th] The Third General Assembly of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee continued to be held at 3:20 PM on the afternoon of the 4th. Committee Member Bai Chongxi presided, and Weng Wenhao delivered an economic report, which lasted one hour and twenty minutes. After the break, the meeting continued at 5:00 PM. The Chairman announced the review of the financial, economic, and monetary reports. Chen Xihao spoke first, pointing out that the monetary system in Xinjiang has not yet been reorganized, which has led to rising prices and made it almost impossible for comrades working in the border areas to make a living. He hoped to speed up the reorganization of the new currency and increase the treatment of comrades working in the border areas. Yang Jizeng believed that according to the currency ratio, the current national budget cannot be said to be too large. The government should have a way to control the budget to balance revenue and expenditure. Pan Gongzhan said that with regard to finance and economy, if there is no way to deal with economic production, then it is impossible to balance financial revenue and expenditure. He cited that factories in Shanghai and other areas are still at a standstill, and there is no exact number of received materials. According to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, even the most satisfactory Shanghai area in terms of reception is still like this, so the situation in other places can be imagined. Because factories are at a standstill, idle funds have no proper outlet, so they tend to speculate, and the government has not decided on the prices of gold and foreign exchange for a long time, giving speculators an opportunity to take advantage of. Over the past few months, due to the stimulation of fluctuations in gold and US dollar prices, prices have generally risen. Taking Shanghai as an example, the price index has risen by four times from October last year to February this year. In the future, all sectors of the country should assist in supervising the financial situation, tightening the currency, and recovering the large amount of currency in the hands of the people. He also called on the authorities on behalf of the people of the southeastern provinces to continue to redeem puppet currency. Song Yishan proposed saving money and increasing revenue and encouraging savings to bring legal tender back into circulation. Cheng Zhongxing emphasized the extreme difficulties of local finances, believing that if local areas have solutions, the central government will have solutions. Since the exemption of agricultural taxes, local governments have fallen into a state of chaos. He also pointed out that private banks and money shops in the counties along the Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) line have all been suspended and should be reorganized as soon as possible, and the power in various places should be restored to increase local production. Regarding the handling of enemy and puppet industries in various provinces and regions, only local people participate in the matter, and the central supervisory agency has no way to intervene. He believes that this violates the five powers and ignores the power of supervision, and expresses his protest. Deng Feihuang believed that the difficulties in finance and the disorder in finance can be explained by two examples: one is the loss of confidence in the gold policy, and the other is the mismatch between the puppet currency and the legal tender at a ratio of 200 to 1. He also questioned why the funds frozen in the United States have not yet been withdrawn, and why it is not possible to investigate national disaster wealth and speculative non-share income and impose heavy taxes on them. The review ended at 6:00 PM, and the Chairman announced the adjournment. The secretariat reported that the conference will continue to review financial, economic, and monetary affairs on the morning of the 5th and report on foreign affairs.

### Eastern Mongolia Requests Autonomy and the Northeast Headquarters Has Refused

[United Press, Beiping, 4th] Four representatives from Eastern Mongolia, sent by the Mongolian People's Assembly to make independence requests, were disclosed in a private conversation here yesterday by one of the representatives, Mr. Sangkejabu. They wanted to request autonomy from the central government, but were rejected by the Northeast Headquarters. Sang said that Mongolia has wanted to obtain autonomy for 35 years, and this is the fourth time. They do not have any party or foreign forces as their backing. The Mongolian people do not have enough strength and do not want to establish a republic. The area they are requesting for autonomy extends 150 kilometers north of Changchun to the border of Outer Mongolia, east to Hulun, and west to Pingquan, with a population of about 1.7 million. The Mongolian people all understand the current complex international relations and feel that the time is not yet right to request autonomy, so they are willing to wait until China has achieved peace and security. However, if the central government does not allow autonomy, the Mongolian people will rise up and fight. The 553 members of the Mongolian People's Assembly, 60% are workers and farmers, 10% are small industrial merchants, 12% are soldiers, 8% are government officials, and the remaining 10% are landlords, monks, and women, etc. were all elected on November 1. The Mongolian people firmly oppose oppression from the central government, the Communist Party, or the Soviet Union. No matter who tries to interfere, the Mongolian people will resist.

### A Large Number of Japanese Prisoners of War in the Northeast Have Been Transported to the Soviet Union

[United Press, New York, 3rd] According to a report from the Columbia Broadcasting Company's correspondent in Shenyang, Mora, the commander of the Soviet army in the Northeast, Stankevich, told American reporters yesterday when he hosted a press conference that a large number of Japanese prisoners of war, from 500,000 to 1 million people, have been transported to the Soviet Union. It is also said that Shi said: "He has no knowledge of the US plan to send Japanese expatriates in the Northeast back to their country."

[United Press, Washington, 3rd] The Washington Evening Star published an editorial today stating that the US's concerns and suspicions cannot be eliminated until the issue of the Soviet Union's removal of industrial equipment in the Northeast is clarified. The Soviet Union's sudden action to take this action without notifying the United States, China, and other United Nations countries is clearly an opportunistic act. Even if the Soviet Union has the right to share a portion of the Northeast's equipment, it has no reason to take any items at this time. This issue should "obviously" be handled by a compensation committee jointly formed by the United Nations.

### 5,000 Japanese Prisoners of War in Nanjing Dredge the Qinhuai River

[United Press, Nanjing, 4th] 5,000 Japanese prisoners of war have now been ordered to undertake the work of dredging the Qinhuai River. The last batch of 2,038 Japanese expatriates left for Shanghai today in preparation for repatriation. There are only 600 Japanese expatriates left here, who are assigned to work in various agencies.

### Zhang, Zhou, and Ma Fly to Gui Sui and Yan'an, Three People Scheduled to Inspect Wuhan Today

[This newspaper, Hankou, 4th] The three-person military group, Zhang Zhizhong, Zhou Enlai, and Marshall, are scheduled to fly to Wuhan tomorrow afternoon for inspection. Their advance team will arrive here today, and all sectors are preparing a grand welcome. In addition, Zhu Xiannian, commander of the Communist Central Plains Military Region, Chief of Staff Zheng Weisand, and Political Commissar Chen Shoudao, and others arrived in Hankou yesterday from Xuanhua Store and are scheduled to visit Commander-in-Chief Guo today. According to Zhu, the purpose of this trip is to report the military mediation situation in the Central China region to the three people of Zhang, Zhou, and Ma.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 4th] Zhang, Zhou, Ma, and a group of 35 people took off in two large planes this morning at 9:20 AM and flew to Gui Sui, starting their fourth day of inspection. After a short stay in Suiyuan, they will transfer to Yan'an in the afternoon. The heads of the party, government, military, and groups and the three representatives of the executive group went to the airport to see them off.

Lei Ke's Achievements in Shandong Province

[United Press, Jinan, 3rd] Colonel Lei Ke, the American representative of the Military Mediation Executive Department in Jinan, is physically strong and has a reputation for being capable. For several weeks, he has been conducting military mediation in the area around here and has rescued tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians from three cities surrounded by the Communist army. The three-person committee of Marshall and others came to Jinan today to conduct an on-the-spot investigation of the mediation situation, and Colonel Lei Ke also went to report. His subordinates described his work process as follows to the reporter: At that time, Lei Ke discovered that Yanzhou, Liaocheng, and Tai'an were all under siege by the Communist army. The defending troops in the city were central troops reorganized from puppet troops. Because the Communist army implemented a strict blockade, there was a food shortage in the city, and the soldiers and civilians were dying. With the full support of the central and Chinese Communist representatives in the group, Lei Ke took strict actions and ordered special vehicles to be loaded with food and personally escorted them into the Communist lines. On one occasion, a county magistrate appointed by the central government secretly passed the blockade line and appealed to Lei Ke to issue food. On the way back, he was besieged by agitators who claimed that he was related to the enemy and puppet governments during the war and that he must be executed. According to eyewitnesses, Lei Ke stepped forward and told the crowd, "You cannot execute him, you can execute me, but things will not be resolved because of this." The crowd backed down, and so the food, the county magistrate, and Lei Ke all passed through the blockade line into the city. Lei Ke's success in mediation is due in part to his courage and in part to his tenacity. He must strive to resolve any problem before it is resolved, so he is trusted by both sides. Perhaps this is why Lei Ke was able to submit such a report to Marshall today: "In this area, the situation is calm, the people in the besieged cities have been supplied with food, and there seem to be no difficulties at present."

Communist Troops Levy Grain and Allocate Funds in Henan Province

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 3rd] (1) More than 1,000 people from the Independent Regiment and the Anlu County Brigade fled from Lishan to Shoushan to assist the Communist Party in collecting agricultural taxes in Anlu County. (2) The Communist army recently collected more than 26,000 shi of grain in Xuanhua Store and is still continuing to plunder. (3) The Communist army in the south of Guangshan has recently repeatedly levied grain and allocated funds from the people. The first time, each bao (unit of organization) was asked for 15,000 catties of grain and 300,000 yuan. The second time, each bao was asked for 50,000 catties and 600,000 yuan. One bao was asked for 500,000 catties of grain and 500,000 yuan. (4) More than 1,000 people from the Communist army's Huang Lin Department recently detained many bao chiefs in Shanghe Store, Quexi, and ordered each bao to pay 5,000 catties of grain and 500,000 yuan.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 4th] Liu Bocheng, commander of the Communist Taihang Military Region, came to Bing with the three-person group on the 3rd and left Bing for Anyang on the morning of the 4th.

### Second Plenary Session Holds Memorial Week for the Premier; President Chiang Personally Attends and Instructs, Urging Calm and Composed Practical Discussions

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 4th] The Second Plenary Session held the Premier's Memorial Week at 9:20 AM on the 4th. Attendees included President Chiang, Wu Jingheng, Yu Youren, Ju Zheng, Sun Ke, Dai Chuanxian, Li Jishen, Chiang Song Meiling, Wang Chonghui, Chen Cheng, Chen Guofu, and 291 others. President Chiang presided, leading the ceremonies. He then delivered an impromptu address, stating: The comrades have been enthusiastically reviewing issues for three days. I place immense hope in this spirit of love for the Party and the nation. This plenary session is related to the success or failure of our Party and the survival of the nation. All comrades must remain calm and composed, recognize the reality of the domestic and international environment, and study practical solutions, avoiding superficial and fragmented observations, and habitual grandstanding and empty rhetoric. The President then provided a detailed analysis of international relations and domestic conditions. Regarding the Political Consultative Conference, he believes this is a demonstration of the Party's responsibility to the nation and the people. We should promote its implementation for the benefit of the nation. However, the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution are the Party's consistent goals and are inseparable. Some people believe that as long as the Three Principles of the People are recognized, there is no need to adopt the Five-Power system. This point needs to be clarified in detail. The Constitution is a grand plan for the nation's long-term stability, and comrades should review it based on the Premier's important legacy. However, as decisions have already been made at the conference, we can only carefully plan remedies for the major deficiencies. Finally, he encouraged all comrades at the plenary session to ensure that all words and actions are purposeful, policy-driven, and magnanimous, avoiding being overly concerned with temporary gains and losses. The meeting should promote Party ethics, demonstrate a democratic spirit, and respect discipline, to complete the Party's mission of revolution and nation-building. The speech lasted 50 minutes, with enthusiastic applause several times throughout. After the speech, the Party member code of conduct was read, and the ceremony concluded.

### Tens of Thousands Boarding Ships in Kowloon; New First Army to Depart for the Northeast; Approximately Ten or More Soviet Divisions in the Eastern Nine Provinces

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] Chongqing Report: According to those recently returning to Chongqing from northern Cambodia, the exact number of Soviet troops in the Northeast is difficult to estimate, as they come and go frequently, wanting to leave but staying again, returning after leaving, with such instances occurring repeatedly. However, the approximate number is believed to be ten or more divisions (including the three divisions in Dalian), which is highly credible. As for the number of senior Soviet technical personnel who have already arrived in various locations in the Northeast in fields such as electrical appliances, chemicals, mining and metallurgy, civil engineering, construction, agriculture, meteorological research, and military industrial arts, the number is at least approximately 1,500 or more. The Japanese technical personnel currently remaining in the Northeast have been recruited by the Soviet army and are being prepared for further education. The number is astonishing. It is said that in the three major central mining complexes in the Fushun mining area alone, there are more than a thousand Japanese technicians. In recent days, the Soviet army has conducted exercises of varying scales in Dalian, Lushun, Changchun, and Shenyang. This is not surprising, as their spirit of "not forgetting danger in times of peace" has become an excellent tradition.

[United Press, Hong Kong, 4th] Tens of thousands of soldiers from the Chinese New First Army, all seasoned veterans of the Burma campaign, are boarding American transport ships in Kowloon daily, preparing to depart for Qinhuangdao to strengthen the National Army's forces in the eastern nine provinces. This well-equipped unit began loading on the 21st of last month and will require ten more days to complete the transfer. The ships responsible for transportation were originally American landing ships, capable of carrying tanks and other mechanized equipment. Each warehouse-style warship's deck carries approximately 800 soldiers, crowded on top of rice sacks or other packages, along with over a dozen Jeeps and trucks arranged in rows. The entire army carries over 2,000 motorized vehicles and approximately 6,000 horses. The coastline is experiencing rough waves, and although the American sailors are skilled at navigation, they will likely struggle to cope. The First Army is a formidable Chinese force, well-dressed, and equipped with heavy firepower. During their operations in Burma, British and American officers praised their strong combat capabilities.

[Agence France-Presse, Shenyang Dispatch] Although the Soviet authorities returned the administrative authority of Shenyang to the Chinese government on December 25th of last year, to date, the number of Chinese municipal personnel and technicians sent to take charge of municipal work is no more than one thousand. Since January of this year, 15,000 troops from the "Chinese Government Army" have arrived in Shenyang, with troops arriving daily from the Jinzhou area. According to General Stankevich, commander of the Soviet garrison in Shenyang, the Soviet garrison in Shenyang began to withdraw in November of last year, but was subsequently ordered by his superiors to remain partially stationed. Although the Soviet military authorities have received orders not to interfere in Chinese diplomatic affairs, the numerous current problems compel me to contact General Peng Bisheng, commander of the Chinese army in Shenyang, and Mr. Dong Wenqi, mayor of Shenyang. The military situation around Shenyang is quite chaotic. There are frequent visits from individuals claiming to be generals of the Chinese government army, stating that they have thousands of troops under their command, but investigations reveal that they are imposters, and a few have been arrested by General Peng. There are also instances of armed forces impersonating government troops within the city, but they are not easily identified. Chinese government troops or other units are stationed in the villages around Shenyang. Regarding the issue of the withdrawal of Japanese prisoners of war, to my knowledge, 60,000 Japanese prisoners of war in the Shenyang area have been disarmed and then withdrawn, with their destination unknown. The Japanese army destroyed some of its military equipment, including multiple aircraft. Furthermore, Mr. Shi did not specify how the Soviet Union used the weapons received from Japan, only stating that some of them have been transferred to the Chinese police.

### Memorial Service Held in the Provisional Capital for Zhang Xinfu Yesterday

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 4th] The memorial service for Mr. Zhang Xinfu and other eight martyrs who died on duty, was held by all circles of the provisional capital at the Youth Hall on the morning of the 4th. Representatives from the National Political Council and other national and local organizations, as well as schools, totaling approximately 3,000 people from 400 units attended. President Chiang, President Song, and the governments of the nine northeastern provinces and two municipalities sent representatives to present wreaths and elegiac couplets. Kong Geng presided over the memorial service, with Mo Dehui as the chief celebrant, and representatives from all sectors as attendant celebrants. Zhang Jia'ao, representing Li Junfu, provided a detailed account of the circumstances surrounding the deaths of Zhang Xinfu and the other eight martyrs, as well as the negotiations before and after the incident, based on a recent telegram from Mayor Dong Wenqi.

### U.S. Marine Corps in China Reduced by 12,000

[Associated Press, Beiping, 4th] It was disclosed here today that 4,000 officers and soldiers from the U.S. Third Amphibious Force will be withdrawn from North China via Tanggu and Qingdao within the next week to implement the plan to gradually reduce the Marine Corps strength to 12,000. By the end of March, the available ships will be increased to complete the troop reduction. After the announcement was released yesterday by the China Theater Headquarters in Shanghai, the Third Amphibious Force immediately disclosed today that although the Marine Corps stationed in North China will be reduced by 12,000 officers and soldiers, the tactical effectiveness of the combat elements within the amphibious force will still be retained. The brief news release also stated, "The troop reduction will be completed by April 1st. This operation is in parallel with the reduction of personnel in the Pacific units of the Marine Corps to peacetime levels." The statement emphasized that the result of the troop reduction is to streamline and reorganize the Third Amphibious Force, but it does not mean the dismissal of any officers or soldiers.

### Attlee's Speech

[This Newspaper] London, 4th Broadcasting: British Prime Minister Attlee delivered a speech in the House of Commons today, with the following main points: (1) To ensure that the political transition in India proceeds peacefully, British troops will remain stationed in India. (2) The British side will do its best to cooperate with the United Nations to establish world regulations, but only the situation within the next year can be predicted at present; predictions beyond one year cannot be made. (3) The United Kingdom is carrying out demobilization. The army will be reduced to one million men by the end of this year.

### Mo Dehui to Visit Xifeng to Meet Zhang Xueliang

[United Press, Chongqing, 4th] It was reported here today that Mo Dehui, on the orders of President Chiang, will soon travel to Xifeng to meet Zhang Xueliang and will return to Chongqing in approximately two weeks.

### Zaozhuang Declared Relieved Yesterday, Designated as a Co-Managed Area by Both the Nationalists and Communists

Discussions are underway to restore transportation and ship out stored coal.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th Urgent Telegram] After Marshall, Zhang Zhizhong, and Zhou Enlai personally inspected Xuzhou this time, Zaozhuang, which had been besieged for three months, was declared relieved at 9:00 AM this morning. The Xuzhou Group of the Military Mediation Department is continuing technical discussions on the two major difficult problems of restoring transportation and shipping out 240,000 tons of stored coal from the Zhongxing Company. It is widely believed that after the stored coal in Zaozhuang is shipped out, coal prices in Nanjing and Shanghai will fall. The Zhongxing Coal Mining Company in Zaozhuang has been besieged for three months, but fortunately, most of the equipment is in the south, and the losses are not significant. However, due to the dispersal of the laborers and the lack of food, it will be difficult to resume work in the short term. It is reported that the relevant authorities intend to send personnel to assist in handling the aftermath. Zaozhuang has now been designated as a co-managed area, and it is said that the scope of co-management includes coal mines, transportation, and general security. Therefore, the reorganization and restoration of the Zhongxing Coal Mine will also have to wait until the management committee jointly formed by the Nationalists and Communists is established before it can be launched.

### To Resist the Atomic Bomb, American Scientists Propose Four Effective Measures

[United Press, Berkeley, California, 3rd] Physicist Dr. Robert stated in a report for the Naval Weapons Laboratory that the United States can resist an atomic bomb attack if it takes all effective defensive measures. As far as can be foreseen at present, the power of the atomic bomb will continue to develop, enough to cause a part of the country to collapse, but if there is sufficient defense in advance, the United States cannot be destroyed in one fell swoop. The effects of an atomic bomb attack can be mitigated by the following four measures: (1) Continue to maintain a leading position in atomic bomb research; (2) Maintain a sufficiently strong army, navy, and air force, all of which are trained in the use of the latest weapons; (3) Move important industries and munitions industries underground to protect them; (4) Maintain a sufficient intelligence agency operating abroad.

### The World's Greatest Sluice Gate

This illustration offers a glimpse of the core equipment of the world's greatest sluice gate—the "Grand Coulee Dam" in America. This world's number one great dam, built on the Columbia River by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, aims to control and rectify the river's turbulent currents, develop electricity, supply water for irrigating farmland, and serve other state purposes. The dam's highest point is 553 feet (equivalent to 165.9 meters), and its reservoir extends upstream for 151 miles (equivalent to 231.6 kilometers), reaching all the way to the Canadian border. In the next twenty-five years, the water supplied by the "Grand Coulee" dam can irrigate 1.2 million acres of land (equivalent to 480,000 hectares) and power hydroelectric plants. The electricity generated from these hydroelectric plants can also supply electricity for lighting and power in rural villages, pastures, and cities, and drive machinery in various factories, as part of America's electrification plan. More than 40% of America's six million farms now have electric lighting and power equipment. This large dam project in the United States can serve as a good example for many countries to develop rural electrification after the war.

### Diverse Coastal City in South China: Fuzhou, a Kaleidoscope

— Special dispatch by our newspaper on February 24th, from Mu Yun

After a full three days, the reporter traveled 450 nautical miles from Shanghai to Fuzhou.

Fuzhou—a diverse coastal city, truly brings warmth to travelers. Here, it is already late spring. Ancient banyan trees spread their enormous wings, quietly waiting for passersby to rest. Peach blossoms, white orchids, and nameless small flowers all face the spring breeze, emitting fragrance. Oranges, tangerines, loquats, olives... hang on the branches, waiting to be picked. Wheat ears and rapeseed flowers are spread flat in the fields of the plains. The quiet green Min River is filled with large, high-masted sailing ships drifting from overseas. Small boats, painted bright red, float under the long bridge. Drum Mountain and Flag Mountain on both sides embrace the soft streams and dilapidated long bridges. People are like being in the beautiful mountains, inhaling the breath of the spring earth. Life seems more active here.

Banyan City Has Many Beauties: Simple and Relaxed

Banyan City produces beauties. We have certainly paid attention to this rumor. The women here, just like other anti-Japanese inland areas, have a simple yet lively and cheerful tone. In the hot spring bathhouses on Shuibu and Wenquan Roads, there are female attendants and female back scrubbers (though not very openly). There are low-class "water girl"-like prostitutes, as well as private prostitutes who speak fluent Shanghai and Beijing dialects, and boat girls who row small boats during the day and live a mythical goddess life at night. Like rats (there is a not-so-severe plague going on now), Fuzhou has plenty of these types of women.

Superficially a Dance Hall, Actually a Flesh Market

Strolling along Zhongzheng Road, you'll find tea, umbrella, lacquerware, and fruit shops. People surge like tides. There are no cars, only narrow pedicabs that ring and run quickly. Occasionally, there is a Jeep, which attracts a lot of attention. The alleys and streets share the same characteristic: cleanliness, even when filled with swirling dust during the heat of noon. People can be entertained by the local Min opera and pre-war films forgotten by Shanghai residents. There are two dance halls, Queen and International. Queen uses a gramophone for accompaniment. International has only three or five musicians from Shanghai's Great World, playing out-of-tune, decadent music. The dancers are local girls, prostitutes, private prostitutes, and local socialites, dressed flamboyantly, dancing the bull walk, hugging the waists of dancers from Shanghai and Hong Kong, using the simplest Min dialect to seduce civil servants and travelers looking for excitement. Tea costs 300 yuan, only clear tea, nothing else. This is not a dance hall, but an open flesh market.

Prices Soaring: When Will Cheapness Return?

Alarming soaring prices have turned the lives of 310,000 people from ordinary to tense, and have also fueled the expansion of consumption. There are anecdotes circulating in the city about nouveaux riches who have made fortunes by going to Taiwan and Shanghai. They have become wealthy through speculation and manipulation. Taking rice prices in recent days as an example, they have soared from 7,000-8,000 yuan per stone to 15,000 yuan. Following rice, other daily necessities are also rising. The government is holding price stabilization efforts, and requesting 52,000 stones of tax rice to be shipped to Fuzhou as soon as possible. This serious problem has worried the Zhenshui Naval General, who has been inviting gentry and merchants to form a relief association, and the police station has paraded rice profiteers such as Lin Weifan in the streets to warn others. The Cuibao newspaper on the 15th had such a provocative headline: "Fuzhou rice prices reach 15,000 yuan, have the provincial leaders heard? Stabilizing prices are eagerly awaited, when will 'Pinggui return home'?" The provincial government spokesman publicly stated that they want to suppress prices to 10,000 yuan per stone, and all newspapers unanimously demanded "fulfillment!" Besides rice, tea, the famous Fujian Xiangpian, was still 100,000 yuan per dan ten days ago, but now it has risen to about 400,000 yuan and is still out of stock. However, general food stores are cheaper than those in Shanghai.

Female Students Wear Skirts, Male Students Wear Uniforms

From the perspective of education, Fuzhou has many schools, but the general education level is really too poor. We visited several elementary schools, and there were too many corrected words on the students' test papers. In the YMCA middle school, English is not tested in the first grade of junior high school. Most of the notices posted on the doors of wine shops and stores on the streets are illiterate. Even in the hotel, the notice from the official health office contains the phrase "Our staff has no many eyes and ears, and it is difficult to check everything, and there may be negligence...", a grammar that is rare. However, the fact that female students wear skirts and male students wear uniforms, and that they can all speak Mandarin, is quite pleasing.

The Press Suffers from Many Ailments: Freedom Is Seen as Tyranny

The decline in education levels, the high prices, and the difficulty in maintaining public order have also affected the activity of the cultural publishing industry. Newspapers and magazines from Shanghai are half a month or a month late, and the purchasing power of readers is very weak. Fuzhou currently has six newspapers, including Central Daily News, Justice Daily, Democracy News, Minhai Daily, Southern Daily, and Cuibao, all printed on local paper. They jointly raised prices on the 16th to maintain their capital. The actual sales volume is very poor, and the reports are common. People familiar with the inside story of the news industry severely pointed out the ailments of the Fuzhou news industry: They do not look forward to the abolition of the censorship system, as this would increase the burden on the newspaper and the editors. The freedom of the press and freedom of speech given by the government is actually spiritual and business tyranny!

Not Enough Ships to Taiwan: Crossing the Sea Is Harder Than Ascending to Heaven

Fujian's climate and geography are influenced by Taiwan, and although the two provinces are separated by a malignant and dangerous strait, they are actually closely linked. Especially with the current lack of transportation, Fuzhou has become Taiwan's rear supply station. People go from here to the neighboring province for business and politics, using sailing ships or shed boats that burn diesel and weigh about 100 tons. Many merchants made a fortune in Taiwan Province before the Taiwan dollar was converted into legal currency and before exports were controlled. The main transactions were sugar and bananas. There are now several ships that regularly go to Taiwan Province, but they are willing to carry goods, not passengers, because the freight rate per ton has increased from 30,000 to 120,000, while passenger tickets have only increased from 6,000 to 12,000. Therefore, as of now, there are more than a thousand people stranded in Fuzhou waiting to go to Taiwan, all trapped in inns and unable to cross the sea. There is a route from Fuzhou to Taipei on the newspaper. It is said that the runway at Yiyu Airport is broken and needs to be repaired, which will take two or three months. This will further reduce the traffic line to Taipei.

The diverse coastal city—Fuzhou, after being devastated twice by the enemy and puppets, has not found any other hoof prints except for some remnants left on Gushan Mountain. This city is just like a beautiful flower. As long as the social environment and customs change from complex to simple, and with practical construction, combined with the natural environment, irrigating the spring water in March, this flower will not wither.

The ancient South China city's style is enough to evoke long memories and nostalgia!

### Modern Buildings on Hainan Island

Hainan Island, isolated overseas, is well-equipped and, like Taiwan, symbolizes one of China's eyes. Since its recovery, with organization and utilization, it will be like the finishing touch, making it even more beautiful. Cai Jinjun, who was recently sent to Hainan as the director of the Provincial Chairman's Office, said: "Hainan Island today is like a fair-looking village girl. With a touch of makeup, she will be charming." - Really, let this village girl quickly dress up!

### Communist Party Representatives Guests in Xuzhou

— Special correspondent of this newspaper, Jiang Jun

Recently, a group of "strange guests" have been residing in the Tongshan branch of the Three People's Principles Youth League in Xuzhou – the Communist Party representatives and their entourage in the Fourth Mediation Group. The so-called "strange guests" are because these guests were previously the political enemies of the Three People's Principles, the believers of communism.

Driven by curiosity, and for the sake of this group of unfamiliar faces that are related to the future of our nation's military and political unity and national rejuvenation, people who pass by its door can't help but turn their heads and give it a fleeting glance.

This is a new-style building, quietly standing next to Qiming Road. Since it became the reception center for the Communist Party representatives, two guards of military police have been added outside to protect it. When the reporter went to visit, I felt that this house had a bit of "solemnity" added to it.

After a strict interrogation, a military police comrade took me to see the liaison adjutant of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters. I explained my purpose, and after about five minutes, the messenger led me to go. There was a military police guard at each of the two inner doors and the entrance to the stairs. When I reached the highest floor, the messenger returned, and a Communist soldier "escorted" me instead. At this time, I discovered that the separation between the upper and lower floors was just like the current military situation. The upper floor was completely a Communist world. The guards all wore blue-edged, white-bottomed, blue-lettered "New Fourth Army" badges. I thought to myself: "I have entered the Communist Army area."

"Was the procedure for you to come in very convenient?" Before I could open my mouth, Communist Party representative Wang Shiying asked me this question head-on.

"Very convenient." I truthfully replied to him.

So, he explained to me: In the past, when newspaper reporters went to visit him, they had to go through multiple negotiations and had to wear the "Pacification Headquarters" symbol. He added that I was the fifth reporter to meet him.

Deputy Chief of Staff Wang Shiying

Wang Shiying is of medium height, a burly physique, and a typical Northerner. He speaks with a Shanxi accent and often reveals the two gold teeth inlaid in his upper gums. He looks like a carpenter or a cook, but his attitude towards people is rough but meticulous, and he constantly uses new terms. He wore a newly made woolen, modified military uniform, with the rank insignia of a major general. His business card read: "Deputy Chief of Staff of the National Revolutionary Army Eighteenth Group Army."

Deputy Chief of Staff Wang Shiying said: "The scope of work of the Xuzhou Mediation Group includes the entire area under the jurisdiction of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters. As of now, the mediation work has made no concrete progress."

"The areas controlled by the Communist Party within the scope of the Xuzhou Mediation Group include the 'Central China Military Region' (the Subei area), the 'Shandong Military Region,' and a portion of the 'Jilu Military Region' (with the Jinpu Railway in Shandong Province as the boundary, the area east of the railway line is the 'Shandong Military Region,' and the area west of the railway line is the 'Jilu Military Region'). There are 'New Fourth Army' and 'Eighth Route Army' in each of these areas."

Both Sides Withdraw Sixty Li

"Regarding the Military Mediation Executive Department's order for both sides to withdraw their troops sixty li, the Communist Party believes that this regulation is beneficial to the National Army and difficult to comply with."

The reporter asked: Does the Communist Party's request for the National Army to withdraw from Lincheng and Zaozhuang hinder the restoration of the Jinpu Railway? Does it hinder the progress of the mediation work? He said: "Lincheng and Zaozhuang are located in the center of the vast area controlled by the Communist Army. The Communist Party believes that the threat is too great and must demand that the National Army withdraw."

"If both sides can make concessions, the mediation work will eventually be completed." This was his final explanation to the reporter, "to comfort himself."

That day, Wang Shiying specifically ordered someone to buy a pack of "Chesterfield" cigarettes to entertain the reporter.

Formal Representative Wei Guoqing

Wang Shiying is the Communist Party representative in the Xuzhou Mediation Group. A few days earlier, he flew to Peiping. The formal representative, Wei Guoqing, is the acting commander of the Second Division of the "New Fourth Army." This person wears a cotton cloth gray military uniform, cloth shoes, and is plainly dressed, not smiling, and speaks in a deep and solemn tone. The Communist Party's atmosphere seems to be stronger. He also has a bit of the "Guangxi" hometown flavor. When the reporter was talking with Wei Guoqing, a young man sitting next to him held a notebook and recorded our conversation at a very fast speed. It is said that he is a staff member of the Political Department of the "New Fourth Army." This Communist political work comrade speaks more kindly and affectionately. I am a person who is used to being casual, and when I am placed in such a state, it seems a bit "that way."

Pacification Headquarters Offers Good Meals

The Communist Party representatives and their entourage, more than 20 people in total, live in Xuzhou and are hosted by the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters. Every day, there are four dishes and one soup, white flour steamed buns, and rice. The food is very good. The after-dinner pastime is playing table tennis, and the life interest is quite strong. The government has also specially prepared a car for their transportation when they go out. The Communist soldiers with the "New Fourth Army" and "Eighth Route Army" badges wear uniforms that are similar to those of the National Army, with both grass green and gray packages, but the upper garment is longer, hanging down to the knees. The representatives and entourage are all brand new, obviously specially prepared for "guesting." These Communist soldiers seem to be all intellectuals who have received rigorous training and are courteous in dealing with people. They get along harmoniously with the "Central Military Police." If this point can symbolize the future of the entire relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, we can assert that China will definitely have a solution.

### The Motherland's Giant Eye, Alone Overseas: Hainan Island, Leap Forward!

— Special Dispatch from Our Correspondent Mu Sheng, Sanya Bay

Hainan Island, along with Taiwan, is known as one of "China's two giant eyes." Since October 17th of last year, when the 46th Army, led by Commander Han Liancheng, with its 188th and 19th New Divisions, began taking over the island in separate directions, everything has progressed smoothly. As of now, all areas have successively been recovered, following the glorious victory of the motherland. If this place is truly the so-called "Shangri-La," then now is the time to "Shangri-La-ize" it. By "Shangri-La-ize," the reporter means the embodiment of reconstruction and rehabilitation efforts. Based on the reporter's week-long investigation, this report provides a comprehensive overview of the various inherent facilities and their current status, which the readers of this newspaper will hopefully find informative.

It is reported that before our officials arrived in Hainan Island to take over, the stubborn and wicked Japanese had secretly transported large quantities of military equipment and supplies to various coastal ports and sunk them there. They also set fire to many textiles. All of these are greatly regrettable. It is unknown whether our authorities will impose appropriate punishments on those Japanese wrongdoers. Otherwise, it seems it would be too lenient on the enemy.

People Endure Hardship, Possess a Strong Drive

Although the people here live in hardship, their spirit of perseverance, diligence, liveliness, and strong drive is unmatched by other regions of the motherland. As long as politics can quickly get on track and various enterprises can gradually resume production, it will not be difficult for this island to become one of the most fertile parts of the motherland, which will radiate an even brighter light on the future of the motherland. In terms of agriculture and forestry, natural forests are everywhere, and good timber is inexhaustible. The uncultivated wasteland is more abundant than the cultivated land. The weather is mild, and even winter is as warm as spring. This area (Sanya Bay) has long been known as the "Region of Perpetual Summer," which is due to its proximity to the equator and warmer weather. The coconut groves in winter often present a scene of spring or autumn. If water conservancy is developed, it would be possible to cultivate three times a year, and there would be a surplus of grain to supplement the deficiency of various regions in Guangdong Province. In regards to the problems of seed selection and fertilization, the Sanya Experimental Farm has already made progress. If this unfinished work is continued, these problems will not be difficult to solve.

Factory Equipment Still in Good Condition

It is gratifying that ready-made materials and daily necessities industries (such as soy sauce and leather) were the first to be taken over and have already been utilized and put into production. The industrial and mining equipment is still in good condition and is expected to be put into operation soon. However, heavy industry, the section of the railway from Sanya to Beili, and the leper hospital with special equipment in Haikou have not yet been taken over. A considerable number of workers are unemployed and starving. If emergency relief is not implemented, not only will these workers be in dire straits, but even local public order may become a serious problem. It is said that our competent authorities have paid close attention to this issue and are carefully considering countermeasures.

Currently, Hainan Island is still stuck on the threshold of a difficult transition period. The society is generally confused, and the business community is also in a state of stagnation. Merchants and residents, because of the current state of chaos, are restless. The most unscrupulous ones consider this to be a good opportunity to fish in troubled waters, fabricating various pretexts and colluding with local special forces to implement their tactics of seizing by force, making it impossible for essential commodities to circulate, so that normal business has no room to stand or develop. Although our government has clearly ordered the exemption of land taxes in all recovered areas for one year, there is still a strange phenomenon here of collecting grain under certain names. After suffering seven years of relentless exploitation by the enemy and puppet regime, is it necessary for the people of Hainan to suffer this avoidable and yet unavoidable devastation?

In terms of industry and mining, Hainan Island is uniquely blessed. Although it lacks coal and has short rivers, making it difficult to build large-scale hydroelectric power plants to supply power, making it difficult to become an independent industrial unit, it has extremely good iron ore. Unfortunately, our country does not currently have such a large-scale iron factory to consume 3 million tons of iron ore per year. It is difficult to expect a resumption of work within two years. However, this important resource will sooner or later become a treasure trove for building a new China.

There are many undertakings that must be utilized in Hainan Island in the future. The main ones can be divided into military undertakings, mining, shipbuilding, waterway transportation, electrical industry, and chemical industry. Militarily, the most important facilities include three well-equipped air force bases, a large-scale naval hospital, a bacteria research laboratory, an oxygen manufacturing plant, and a 180-kilometer-long light rail line (from Yulin to Beili).

Developing Resources, Contributing Greatly

Mineral deposits are an important resource of Hainan Island, with extremely rich reserves and excellent mineral quality. The most important is iron. In the past, the Japanese operated two iron mines: the Tiandu Iron Mine and the Shilu Iron Mine. Most of their equipment is still in good condition and can be utilized immediately.

Finally, the reporter hopes that the authorities can actively utilize the military facilities left behind by the enemy, improve or adjust them, and achieve the goal of consolidating the motherland's naval and air bases. Therefore, at present, no one should be preoccupied with personal gain or petty profits and betray the ardent desire for governance of the 3 million people on the island. Rise up! For national defense, for people's livelihood, quickly establish a foundation that will last for all time! (January 15th)

### Reader Opinions: A Suggestion for Stabilizing Prices

Editor: The people are still unaware of whether there has been any improvement in the gold policy recently. In fact, no effective measures have been seen. Also, the rumored Sun Yat-sen banknotes are also a sharp weapon to stimulate prices and the value of legal tender. Now everyone is scrambling to buy red gold and materials, and dare not keep legal tender overnight. If the government wants to solve the hidden pain of the poor and maintain social order, it should urgently adopt the following measures:

(1) First of all, the economic policy and the future currency system reform methods must be clearly announced. If there are factors that compete with the people for profit, or are enough to stimulate prices, they should be eliminated immediately. In particular, the people should have considerable faith in the government's protection of legal tender.

(2) The authorities should announce to the people the fact of Sun Yat-sen banknotes and their value compared with legal tender. If the issuance of Sun Yat-sen banknotes will indeed affect the value of legal tender, or the government has no such plan at all, the authorities should make a detailed statement.

(3) The government should immediately release a large amount of gold at a relatively low official price as much as possible. According to the situation in various places, establish a bill to stabilize prices and announce it immediately. If there are any unscrupulous merchants or degenerates hoarding and manipulating, enforce the law strictly. If this can be done, prices will naturally fall. Ye Xigui (February 26th)

Editorial

### The Destruction of the Franco Regime

Since the establishment of the United Nations, it has continuously exerted pressure on the Franco regime in Spain, believing that the Spanish political situation must be thoroughly reorganized to achieve a democratically elected government, and then Spain can rejoin international politics. Recently, Franco-French relations have suddenly become strained. The French government has ordered the closure of the Franco-Spanish border, believing that the current situation in Spain is sufficient to "endanger international security" and demanding the overthrow of the Franco regime. The Franco-Spanish border is thus fraught with tension, and the pressure exerted by the great powers on the Franco regime has also increased. After receiving the French government's request to sever relations with the Franco regime, the American government consulted with the British and French governments. Although the content of the consultation has not been released, diplomatic sources claim that the United States is proposing that the governments of the United States, Britain, and France declare their disapproval of Franco and express their dissatisfaction with the continued existence of the Franco government. The United States, Britain, and France are also planning to issue a joint statement demanding an end to the Franco regime. How the Franco regime will cope with the situation and how the Spanish people will react to the pressure exerted on Franco by the United Kingdom, the United States, and France remains to be proven by subsequent developments. It seems that we cannot help but say a word about the development of the Spanish situation, because it contains a very important principle in international relations. How this principle will be encountered in future international relations not only concerns the independent survival of all nations, but also concerns the safety of the world.

What we want to state first is that we not only have no goodwill towards the Franco regime, but also have considerable hostility. The Franco regime's flattery of the Axis powers and its recognition of the puppet regimes that appeared in China is something that the Chinese people will never forgive. From the standpoint of the nation, we not only sympathize with but also support the attitude and measures taken by the United Kingdom, the United States, and France towards the Franco regime. But if we look at the measures taken by the great powers against the Franco regime from another perspective, we are very worried that a very important principle in international relations will be abandoned. What is this principle? This is non-interference in internal affairs. It is remembered that the Atlantic Charter made a promise of non-interference in internal affairs. In fact, the pressure exerted by the great powers on Franco securities is no different from interfering in internal affairs. The Franco regime is the only stable regime in Spain at present. Whether from a moral or legal point of view, it seems that the great powers cannot put international pressure on this only stable regime in Spain to make it collapse. The democratic movement must be internal. The overthrow of the Franco regime must be initiated by the Spanish people themselves. If a regime is intolerable to the great powers and is destroyed by pressure exerted by the great powers, if this principle is recognized, then the nations will no longer have independent and autonomous survival. This will be a dangerous precedent in future international relations.

The London Daily Times recently wrote an article to maintain the principle of non-interference in internal affairs and pointed out the Spanish situation, saying: "Few people in Britain during the war and now would support Franco's policies, but his behavior cannot be considered sufficient to 'endanger international security'. In fact, Spain, in its current isolated situation, cannot pose a threat to anyone. Under these circumstances, the demand for joint action against Franco is undoubtedly to divert the world's attention from the many serious and undecided issues facing the United Nations. This diversion is not necessary. The Spanish people will be dissatisfied with foreign interference in their internal affairs. This is enough to make the Spanish people support Franco instead of attacking him. The result of this interference in internal affairs will be endless. Britain must consider carefully before taking action, because this action may damage the principle of non-interference and the dignity of the law. It was to protect these principles that Britain joined the 1939 war. Even today, Britain wants to see its effectiveness in Eastern Europe, although its success is not necessarily consistent." In today's world, the London Daily Times is able to specifically put forward the principle of non-interference and the inviolability of the dignity of the law. The Times has its original intentions, but it coincides with what we see.

In short, we have no love for the Franco regime. From the standpoint of the nation, we would like to see it collapse sooner rather than later. However, if we use international pressure to force it to collapse, we ultimately feel that it damages the principle of non-interference in internal affairs and the dignity of the law. If future international relations are to be built on the basis of the rule of law, damage to the dignity of the law will be a regrettable precedent.

### Uneven Distribution of Daily Necessities Controlled by Industry Associations: Violates Original Intention of Price Stabilization; 351 Tobacco Retailers Request Thorough Investigation

[Dispatch from This Paper] 351 tobacco retailers from this city have jointly requested a thorough investigation into the unfair distribution of daily necessities such as low-priced soap sold by the Handling Bureau. They claim that the distribution is controlled by a small number of people, and most retailers do not receive their share. Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, dozens of representatives went to the Municipal Government to see Mayor Qian and submitted a joint petition for a thorough investigation. According to the representatives, there are approximately 10,000 tobacco retailers in this city. The low-priced goods, such as soap and matches, sold by the Handling Bureau on several occasions have been distributed to only 700 or so tobacco retailers who have special relationships with the industry association and then sold on the black market. The majority of retailers are unable to get their hands on these goods, which is a serious violation of the original intention of stabilizing prices. It was also said that the Handling Bureau has sold low-priced soap five times, totaling more than 400,000 cases. The official price for the first sale of low-priced soap was 9,500 yuan per case, while it was sold on the black market for 18,000 yuan. For the most recent fifth sale, the official price was 20,000 yuan, while it was 28,000 yuan on the black market. Because the low-priced goods are controlled by a small number of retailers and flow into the black market, the citizens have not benefited. At the same time, this reporter also visited the person in charge of the industry association, who said that there are only more than 4,000 retailers in the association. According to the size of the business, they are divided into four grades: A, B, C, and D. Retailers of grades A and B have already received low-priced goods. Because there are more stores of grades C and D and they cannot quickly raise funds, the Handling Bureau is afraid that the distribution procedures will be too troublesome, so they have not distributed to them. The association is currently submitting a document to apply. As for the sale of low-priced goods on the black market, he hopes that retailers will supervise and report each other.

### Brave Police Chief Dies in Line of Duty While Arresting Two Thieves; Shot in the Leg and Stabbed More Than Ten Times in the Head

[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday afternoon at 5:30 PM, a rural household in a village in the north of Longhua Town was suddenly robbed by bandits. As the thieves fled toward the highway, the victim followed closely and shouted "Robbers!"

At that time, a police chief with badge number 8601 from the Longhua Branch, accompanied by two policemen, was returning to the station on official duty. Upon hearing the cries of "Robbers!", he bravely rushed forward. He saw four bandits rushing towards him. The police chief took a step forward and captured two bandits on the spot. He then handed them over to the policemen to guard. The remaining bandits fled into the darkness. The police chief took a step forward and gave chase. One bandit was finally grabbed by the waist. Unexpectedly, the bandit had a firearm and fired three shots, all hitting the police chief in the left leg. However, the injured police chief still held on tightly to the bandit. Another bandit immediately took out a sharp blade and stabbed him in the head, totaling more than eleven wounds. The police chief, due to his severe injuries, collapsed. The two bandits took the opportunity to escape. Before long, a rice truck passed by. At the request of the remaining policemen, they helped the wounded police chief, who was barely breathing, onto the truck, intending to send him to the police hospital for treatment. However, due to excessive blood loss, he died when he arrived at the entrance of the Taishan Branch.

### Factories Damaged During the War Seek Reparations from the Enemy

The Shanghai Machine-Made National Goods Factory Association believes that the damages suffered by factories during the War of Resistance were extremely serious. They have prepared two investigation forms, which have been distributed to all members to fill out and submit to the Social Affairs Bureau for reporting to the central government and seeking reparations from the enemy. It is now learned that the Social Affairs Bureau issued an order to the association yesterday, approving the collection of reported losses.

Hu Xiyuan, the standing committee member of the Shanghai Machine-Made National Goods Factory Association, said that before the War of Resistance, the association served national goods factories and achieved remarkable results. During the War of Resistance, it was unable to operate and temporarily ceased operations. Now that light has returned, the national goods factories are starting to resume production, so the association has also been reinstated, and a new office has been set up at No. 13, Lane 525, Minquan Road. New and old members are welcome to contact them there.

### Northeast Rights Protection Committee Discusses Promoting Association Affairs

Many people, including Wang Xiaolai and Zhou Xuexiang, attended and decided on fundraising and discussed the promotion of association affairs.

### Exchange Rate Implementation Liberalized, Market Responds Well: Implementation of Liberalization

Yesterday's Announcement of US Dollar Telegraphic Transfer Rate of 2020 Yuan; Foreign Currency Sources Arriving Continuously, Prices Will Gradually Fall

[Report from this newspaper] The foreign exchange market, which has attracted much attention, was officially opened yesterday morning at 10 AM, after the Central Bank announced the telegraphic transfer rate for the US dollar that day at 2020 yuan. The telegraphic transfer rate did not fluctuate throughout the day. All 27 designated banks and approved foreign exchange brokers referred to the rate set by the Central Bank. Since the foreign exchange market was just opened, they felt unfamiliar with the various buying and selling procedures stipulated by the Central Bank. Moreover, the telephones for communication between the brokers and the designated banks were not yet fully installed, so the transaction was very sluggish throughout the day, and the exchange market remained stable. In the meantime, before the foreign exchange rate was determined, the Bank of China had accepted mortgage loans from various exporters, and the exchange rate was temporarily calculated at 1,000 yuan. Yesterday, the various exporters went to settle the exchange rate difference of the mortgage loan. The Bank of China settled it at an exchange rate of 1,930 yuan. As for the buying and selling of forward foreign exchange, it has not yet started.

Designated Banks Hold First Meeting Yesterday

This reporter visited Mr. Lin Weiying, the director of the Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank, last night. He said that the market responded very well after the Central Bank opened the foreign exchange market and announced the telegraphic transfer rate for the US dollar that day. The market was calm throughout the day. The Central Bank will have printed all kinds of application forms today. Yesterday, more than ten type A approved business firms applied to the Central Bank, and one type B approved business firm, China Travel Service, applied to the Central Bank. It is also learned that the 27 designated banks held their first meeting yesterday afternoon under the convening of the Bank of China. During the meeting, there was a detailed discussion on the formation of a trade association of designated foreign exchange banks and the future development and connection of business.

Foreign Exchange Brokers Association Established

The 16 approved foreign exchange brokers also established the Shanghai Foreign Exchange Brokers Trade Association at No. 9, Museum Road yesterday. All 16 members attended. Guo Baoshu, Wen Dehua, Wei Boxiang, Dong Xuanheng, and Clark were elected as committee members, with Guo Baoshu as the full-time committee member and Wen Dehua as the deputy director committee member.

People's Hearts are Extremely Stable, and the Future is Extremely Optimistic

According to Wang Xiaolai, the chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, after the opening of foreign exchange, the business community in this city believes that foreign goods can be transported to China in a continuous stream, so people's hearts are extremely stable and optimistic about the future. It is expected that the prices in this city will gradually fall from stability.

Applications Required for the Import of Reserved Luxuries

The "Temporary Measures for Import and Export Trade" promulgated by the government stipulate that various luxury goods are prohibited items in the third category. Importers in this city believe that the luxury goods ordered from foreign countries before the promulgation of these measures are very large in quantity, or have already been shipped, or have been contracted to cannot be returned, and are all extremely anxious. This reporter inquired with the Jianghai Customs yesterday and was told that if the prohibited items were ordered before March 1, they must be applied to the Customs within 10 days and can be imported only after obtaining approval. Applications must also be submitted for the approval of prohibited export items if they were ordered by foreign merchants before March 1, before they can be exported.

### Difficulties in Water Transport in the Upper Reaches of the Yangtze River Increasing Daily

The water level in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River is low, which is rare compared with previous years. According to the shipping industry, the Xuanjiang report at the end of last month reported the lowest water level was nine feet below zero, making navigation more difficult. Minfu and Minlai, two ships of the Minsheng Company, sailed from Yishang at the end of last month. When passing through Qingjiang, the Qingjiang was broken, making it impossible to pass. In order to avoid danger, they have returned to Yichang. According to the shipping industry, if the water level does not rise again, it is feared that ships will not be able to sail directly to Yichang. The transportation between Yu and Yi must be divided into two sections, namely, Yuwan section and Wanyi section, so the entire Yangtze River will be divided into four sections. Also, according to news, there were a total of 20 ships sailing from Yudong downstream in February. Except for two or three that have sailed to Jinghan, the rest have all sailed to Yichang. A total of more than 6,140 passengers and 860 tons of cargo were transported, which is the lowest transportation volume since the restoration. The reason is actually due to water logging.

### Jianghai Customs Iron Gate Closed; 1,500 Workers Conduct Work-to-Rule Yesterday; Six Demands Previously Made Without Reply or Solution; Labor Side Unable to Agree

[Our Dispatch] Over 1,500 workers from the Jianghai Customs on the Bund and the Taxation Bureau on Hart Road began a work-to-rule campaign starting at 2:00 PM yesterday. The iron gates of the Jianghai Customs were tightly shut, and pickets were stationed to prevent unauthorized entry and exit. Although customs officials did not participate, the work-to-rule by workers in the communications department, telephone room, and other areas, along with the shutting off of the main power switch for the lights, made it impossible for officials to work, thus paralyzing the entire customs organization. According to labor representatives, a work-to-rule action occurred on the 23rd of last month due to demands for improved treatment, and six conditions were proposed. At that time, Vice Chief Inspector Ding resolved the matter by temporarily lending each worker two months' salary, with future salaries to be adjusted in line with the cost of living. A response was promised within a week. As the deadline has passed without a reply, a work-to-rule action was implemented. Customs authorities stated that after the work-to-rule incident last month, Chief Secretary Li Du specially flew to Chongqing to seek instructions from the Executive Yuan. Coincidentally, President Song visited Shanghai, and he has been preoccupied with the opening of foreign exchange, leaving him with no time to address the matter. However, the customs authorities had promised a response by this morning, making the workers' work-to-rule action regrettable. At 4:00 PM yesterday, the authorities proposed a solution: before a formal salary adjustment, workers would receive a temporary payment of 84,000 yuan for skilled workers and 68,500 yuan for ordinary workers. However, the workers did not agree to this proposal, and the work-to-rule action continues.

Court Civil Servants Submit Application

[Our Dispatch] All civil servants of the Shanghai District Court, to secure a stable livelihood, jointly submitted an application requesting a salary increase. Representatives elected by them, including Judge Cao Zuwei and six others, held a small group meeting yesterday and submitted the application to President Cha Liangjian. The reported demands include a monthly salary of 200,000 yuan for judges, 150,000 yuan for secretaries and translators, and a minimum salary of 80,000 yuan. If a satisfactory resolution is not reached, the entire court intends to cease operations starting on the 15th.

Labor Dispute at Jingchang Factory Resolved Yesterday

(1) Over 120 workers at the Jingchang Dyeing and Weaving Factory on Binlang Road, who had been conducting a work-to-rule action since the 25th of last month to demand improved treatment, completely resolved their dispute yesterday through mediation by the General Labor Union and have fully resumed work. (2) Over 500 workers at the Zhenzhong Dyeing and Weaving Factory at 841 Xikang Road, who had put forward fifteen demands for improved treatment, were persuaded by representatives from the General Labor Union and resumed work at 4:00 PM yesterday.

Typesetting Industry Workers Find It Difficult to Sustain a Living

Workers in the city's typesetting industry have presented four demands for improved treatment to employers, requesting their acceptance. The Social Affairs Bureau has scheduled a meeting for today to convene representatives from both sides for mediation.

### Automobile Injures Pedestrian

[Our Dispatch] A small automobile from the Municipal Police Bureau, while traveling near the Taishan Branch Office on Linsen Road at 7:30 PM last night, collided head-on with a rickshaw puller. The passenger, Wang Honglin, a practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine, suffered a head injury and is in serious condition.

### Prisoner Wu Jiangleng, Accused of Murder, Claims to be a Political Prisoner

[Our Dispatch] Since the government decided to release political prisoners, all parties have expressed great concern. This reporter has learned from the Shanghai Prison at Tilanqiao that there are currently no political prisoners detained there. Those arrested during the enemy puppet regime for patriotic activities were released on bail in August and September of last year. Yang Zhizhong and six others, who have been appealing to the press in recent days claiming to be political prisoners, were arrested by the puppet Security Command. After interrogation by the High Procuratorate, they were transferred to the Songhu Garrison Command, which took over that department, on February 23. They claim to have been on a hunger strike for five days, demanding to be released under the political prisoner amnesty, but in reality, they reduced their food intake. If they had truly been on a hunger strike for five days, they would have starved to death long ago. Currently, only Wu Jiangleng in the prison claims to be a political prisoner, but he is accused of murder, so the High Court still treats him as an ordinary criminal.

### Japanese War Criminal Ishihara Isamu Tried by US Military Tribunal

Serving as Chief Translator, Committing Many Evils

The US War Crimes Tribunal yesterday tried Japanese war criminal Ishihara Isamu. During the Japanese occupation of Shanghai, he served as the chief translator at the Wusong and Jiangwan concentration camps, acting as a lackey of the aggressors. He treated the 1,200 American prisoners of war in the camps harshly, inflicting beatings, whippings, waterboarding, and other cruel tortures. After the Japanese surrender, he was charged by the US side. Ishihara Isamu is 36 years old and studied in Hawaii in his youth. He has lived in China for ten years and is fluent in Chinese and English in addition to his native Japanese. The US military has accused him of seven counts of abusing prisoners of war, specifically Sergeant Minack, Sergeant Skurka, Sergeant Stout, Sergeant Stewarts, Sergeant Beets, and Americans Gatto and Linau.

Opening Court Session Reads Indictment

The court session opened at 9:00 AM, with Trial Officer Captain Middleton and Colonels Whither, Meeshaw, Svenson, and Georgiason serving as judges. The plaintiffs' prosecutors were Captain Galante and Major Osborne, and the defendant's defenders were Major Lewin and Major Dona. The plaintiffs' prosecutors began by reading the indictment. The defendant's defense attorney requested the dismissal of the case on the grounds that the United States had no right to establish a court in China. The presiding judge opposed the request, stating that China had not objected to the matter, and a formal trial was scheduled for the afternoon.

Afternoon Session Continues with Witness Testimony

In the afternoon, Yazawa Toshihiko was called to testify. He had worked at both the Wusong and Jiangwan camps and witnessed Ishihara Isamu abusing prisoners of war. At the time, most of the prisoners of war were members of the US Marine Corps or employees of American consulates in various locations. Ishihara Isamu resorted to vicious tactics to extort money from the prisoners. The witness claimed: "My parents taught me not to lie, so my testimony today is entirely truthful." However, Yazawa Toshihiko also stated that Ishihara Isamu was impartial, regarded laws and military discipline as unyielding, and, while he abused prisoners of war, also considered the welfare of the prisoners in the camp. He even invited clergymen to the camp to preach to the prisoners and used his own money to provide milk to the sick. The plaintiff's prosecutor asked: If Ishihara Isamu was so "benevolent," why did he "beat prisoners of war"? The witness replied: "Because he was a law-abiding person." Subsequently, Morosako Ichiki was called to testify. His testimony was similar to that of Yazawa. Both had served as translators at the Jiangwan and Wusong concentration camps and worked with Ishihara Isamu. The case is scheduled to resume at 9:00 AM this morning.

### Recruiting Laborers for the Enemy; Two Traitors Sentenced to Life Imprisonment

Shen Anfa Declared Not Guilty

[Our Dispatch] In 1943, the Japanese company Yamakyu in this city, commissioned by the enemy naval attache's office, recruited 180 shipbuilding carpenters from Lubandian to work in the Philippines. After the victory, Jiang Yougen, the "Director" of the Zhejiang Hongbang Carpenter's Guild responsible for the matter, and Zuo Ming, the translator for Yamakyu, were reported to the authorities and arrested. Carpenter Shen Anfa was also implicated. After several trials, the High Court at Tilanqiao announced the verdict yesterday afternoon: Jiang Yougen and Zuo Ming, jointly conspiring with the enemy to recruit military laborers, are sentenced to life imprisonment, and their civil rights are revoked for life. All property, except for the necessary living expenses for their families, will be confiscated. Shen Anfa is found not guilty. If the defendants have any objections, they may apply for a retrial within ten days of receiving the written judgment.

### Chinese Merchants' Electricity Company Incurs Significant Losses After the War

[Our Dispatch] This city's electricity industry has suffered greatly during the eight years of war. Currently, all are under control, but crises are lurking. In the past, due to excessively low electricity prices, electricity theft, and high operating expenses, all Chinese merchant companies have incurred significant losses and are unable to sustain themselves. Therefore, they have specifically questioned the municipal government: (1) Approve a reasonable increase in electricity prices to achieve a balanced budget. (2) The Nanshi and Pudong companies should negotiate with the Shanghai Electric Power Company to connect electricity directly through the former French Concession and the Huangpu River to avoid roundabout routes and power loss. (3) The repairs of the Zhabei Pudong Chinese Merchant Water and Electricity Company should be assisted by the Relief Administration, etc. The Four Allied Relief Organizations should also provide large loans to restore power generation as soon as possible. (4) Urge all electrical companies in the city to cooperate, coordinate the actual needs for the next few years, and start expanding power generation facilities to prevent future problems.

### Tap Water Tastes Salty; Safe to Drink

Caused by High Tides

Recently, the tap water in the city has had a salty taste, which is caused by high tides, low river water levels, and seawater flowing back into the river. According to the records of the Municipal Public Utility Bureau, this phenomenon usually occurs every year between January and March. Although this salty taste is inconvenient for the city's residents to drink, it does not affect their health.

### Dance Schools Renamed Dance Arts Training Centers

Six Regulations Formulated

The First Section of the Administrative Department of the Police Bureau summoned the responsible parties of various "dance schools" in the city yesterday for instructions. Effective immediately, all schools are to be renamed Dance Arts Training Centers, and six regulations to be followed have been issued: (1) Do not misuse titles such as school, principal, instructor, or assistant instructor. (2) There must be no conduct that offends public morals during training hours. (3) Do not sell dance tickets or collect training fees in a similar manner. (4) Do not recruit underage males or females. (5) Do not use the name of dance partner to engage in matchmaking. (6) Do not make noise late at night, disturbing the peace of neighbors.

On Wednesdays and Saturdays, only morning sessions would be held, and afternoon sessions would be suspended. Yesterday was Monday, and the Foreign Exchange Department of the Central Business Bureau followed the regulations and announced the US dollar telegraphic transfer rate at 2,020 yuan. This price was immediately notified to the sixteen foreign exchange brokers and twenty-seven designated banks. Futures trading was temporarily not conducted. The exchange rate for British pounds was also not determined but could be calculated from the US dollar exchange rate. This price is not fixed and will be adjusted at any time based on market supply and demand. Designated banks can also make changes based on the size of their positions and the volume of transactions. Yesterday, transactions did not take place because application forms for settling foreign exchange had not yet been printed. It is also reported that for foreign exchange settlements, the imported goods must first be approved by the customs authorities, and then the designated bank will handle the matter on their behalf. If selling, the amount of foreign exchange must first be settled with the bank, and then the export goods must be presented to customs for inspection. All transactions must be for normal trade. For small amounts and living expenses for overseas personnel, sales and purchases can be made with the bank by stating the reasons and providing sufficient proof. As for gold trading, it is handled in the same way as the US dollar according to central regulations, but it was not officially announced yesterday.

### Silver Shops' Actual Sales Resume Brisk; Gold Price Rises Compared to Previous

Yesterday, due to the large number of small shops and silver shops exchanging gold, gold ornaments were priced up to 167,000. Trading was remarkably lively, with Shengkai opening at 1,520,000 for purchases. Silver shop gangs competed to bid up, once raising the price to the 1,600,000 mark. Securities gangs sold on hearing the news, causing the price to fall to 1,480,000. At this point, buyers and sellers waited quietly for changes. The foreign exchange listing was revealed, hovering around the 1,500,000 mark, then fell to 1,440,000. At noon, it struggled at 1,480,000.

Although 1937 bonds also gained 10 yuan, their base was looser than 1936 bonds.

### Rice Prices Fluctuate; Subsidized Vegetable Oil Planned

Yesterday, the rice market was weak in the morning and firm in the afternoon.

The foreign wheat stored in various factories in Shanghai is being processed into flour day and night. To date, the Relief Administration has sold no less than 500,000 bags of subsidized flour, so the city's flour users are well-supplied. It is reported that large quantities of subsidized oil will be put on sale soon and is currently being planned.

### Yarn and Cotton Transactions Active

Yesterday, the yarn and cloth market was relatively stable. Although customer purchases were not very active, sporadic transactions were very lively. 20-count horse brand yarn rose again to 1,080,000, and small-scale 20-count yarn was around 900,000, with a stable trend and improved sentiment. Fangjian Company sold yarn in the morning and added the sale of cotton cloth in the afternoon, totaling sixteen types. It is reported that local cloth is about 10% cheaper than market prices.

Yesterday, the spot cotton market was still active. Fangjian Company handled 200 bales of Mitlin cotton at 82,000 yuan and imported 200 bales of Brazilian cotton at 78,000 yuan.

### Wenzhou Black Tea Prices Fall Again

Wenzhou black tea is abundant in the market today. Customers are continuously selling, so the price support is weak. As a result, the price per dan is down by 2,000 yuan compared to last week. Other grades remain stable, but the market varies depending on the quality of the goods, so there are mixed results compared to the previous period. In reality, there is a hidden trend of setting prices. As for foreign firms, they are still paying attention, especially since South America is in urgent need of goods. It is reported that some tea factories in the city plan to resume production soon.

### Credit Tightens, Bulls Exit, Securities Fall Across the Board

Government bonds started stable yesterday but then weakened. Trading was not active. As a result, Categories A and B fell slightly by 50 yuan, Category C and D fell by 80 yuan, and Category E fell by 120 yuan. This was due to the impact of the stock market falling. The process was very ordinary. After the bulls' formation collapsed last Saturday, shares became scarce in the market. The gold price stimulated the market slightly. Yongsheng Yarn and America Asia were initially similar to last Saturday's prices. Jingfu was higher than last Saturday. Afterwards, yarn factories decided to sell after buying, resulting in a collapse. Credit tightened, and many parties sold off, lacking support. Near noon, most closed at low prices. Compared to the previous close, Yongsheng Yarn fell by 250 yuan, America Asia by 180 yuan, and Jingfu by 2 yuan. In the afternoon, overseas shares were also affected by the stock price, falling by 5-10%.

### Burned Alkali Order Arrives; Indanthrene Dye Prices Too High

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The price of burned alkali once plummeted at the beginning of last winter. Afterwards, due to supply shortages and increasing demand, it gradually rose, recently reaching 1.1 million, similar to the highest price at the beginning of last winter. Now it is reported that an order from Brunner Mond & Co. has arrived and will be opened for sale soon. It is noted that this order was placed before the Sino-Japanese War, with an order value of over 40,000 yuan. Adding taxes and water transport costs, the amount is also limited, so the market price of burned alkali is expected to be stabilized.

Since De Fu Foreign Firm dispatched a batch of dyes before the war, no further shipments have been made. Later, the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association applied to the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau to relax the allocation quota and suggested that allocations should be based on the production capacity of each factory, rather than solely on the amount of grey cloth in stock. Although this was agreed to, the second batch of goods recently released is still small in quantity, and the price has risen rapidly. For example, the first batch of Indanthrene dye was allocated at nearly 3 million yuan per dan (unit of weight), but this time it has soared to a massive 16.2 million yuan. The Dyeing and Weaving Association is currently requesting a reduction in the allocation price.

### Ministry of Education Adjusts Elementary Education Titles in Recovered Areas; Publicly Established Schools Named National Schools; Privately Run Schools Can Only Be Named Elementary Schools

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing] Regarding elementary education in the recovered areas nationwide, the Ministry of Education will first restore existing schools. Secondly, in accordance with the National Education Law, all elementary schools must be renamed National Schools and Central National Schools. In provinces and counties, Central National Schools will be established in townships and National Schools will be established in villages, depending on local conditions.

### Principles for Returning Overseas Chinese Students to Resume Studies

[Dispatch from Dagong News Agency, Chongqing] Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, remittances from Southeast Asia have been cut off, and overseas Chinese students studying in China have faced financial hardship. The government has provided assistance in terms of clothing, food, housing, transportation, and education to enable them to continue their studies. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has formulated three principles for the repatriation of overseas Chinese students to resume their studies: (1) Once overseas remittances are restored, all forms of assistance will be discontinued. However, those who experience changes in family circumstances or temporary difficulties will continue to receive assistance as appropriate to enable them to complete their studies. (2) Overseas Chinese students studying in secondary or higher schools should continue to complete their studies and return to their original schools. Those who must return to their original place of residence should provide valid documents and register with the Commission to be repatriated as general returning overseas Chinese. (3) Overseas Chinese students who have graduated from colleges or universities should return to their original place of residence to serve if possible and may request the Commission to provide assistance. It is reported that the specific measures have been sent by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to the Ministry of Education for distribution to provincial and municipal education authorities for compliance.

Furthermore, replacement diplomas requested for lost original diplomas also sometimes list the name of the former principal and the student's original graduation date, all of which is inappropriate and should be corrected. It specifically notified provincial and municipal education bureaus that, in the future, regardless of whether the current principal is creating diplomas for former graduates or issuing replacement diplomas due to lost original diplomas, the current principal must sign the diploma, listing the actual date of creation or replacement, while also noting the original graduation date and the reason for the replacement to reflect the actual situation and avoid misunderstandings.

### Glimpses of National Yingshi University, the Wartime Cultural Cradle of Zhejiang (Part 1)

— Huang Lan

National Yingshi University, this may still be an unfamiliar name to people in the recovered areas. This is because its history is too short, and because its wandering and displacement during the war were too intense. In fact, after the fall of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou and the relocation of Zhejiang University to Guizhou, it was the only complete university in Zhejiang. For seven years, it has been hidden in the mountains and distributed in small towns, providing opportunities for young people with aspirations to continue their studies, and also cultivating many new talents for the motherland seeking a new life from suffering. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, and under the extensive needs of post-war construction, there is no doubt that it must shed its old clothes and put on new ones. Here, let me give a comprehensive report on its origin, current situation, and future prospects:

(1) Origin

In the 28th year of the Republic (1939), the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education, in order to commemorate the heroic deeds of the revolutionary martyr Chen Yingshi and to remedy the phenomenon of the decline of higher education in the southeast after the cultural center shifted westward at that time, initiated the establishment of "Zhejiang Provincial Yingshi University" in the eastern Zhejiang water area. It established three colleges: Agriculture, Engineering, and Medicine, intending to cultivate practical talents for the country. This is the predecessor of the current Yingshi University. In the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), Mr. Chen Lifu took over as the Minister of Education and believed that Yingshi University needed to be adjusted and expanded. He nationalized it and transferred the entire law school of the Southeast Associated University to Yingshi University. In addition, he separated the College of Engineering and made it independent as "National Beiyang Institute of Technology"; and added five specialized courses to Yingshi University: Administration, Finance, Accounting, Cooperation, and Art. Due to the impact of the war, the school site was moved from Lishui to Yunhe, and then from Yunhe to Ligongsiqian in Taishun. When Mr. Zhu Jiahua took office as the president, he ordered another adjustment of higher education nationwide. The College of Medicine and the two specialized courses of Art of Yingshi University were merged; "National Beiyang Institute of Technology" was reassigned to Yingshi University. This created the situation of three colleges of Law, Agriculture, and Engineering and three other specialized courses a month ago. Later, the War of Resistance was won. The three specialized courses remaining in Yunhe followed the provincial government to Hangzhou, and the Yingshi University headquarters also moved to Wenzhou for the convenience of repatriation. The above is the process of changes in Yingshi University over the past seven years.

(2) School Affairs Overview

Currently, the College of Law has three departments: Law, Political Science, and Economics. The College of Agriculture has three departments: Agronomy, Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine, and Agricultural Economics. The College of Engineering has three departments: Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Civil Engineering, and Chemical Engineering. President Du Zuozhou stated in an interview: A College of Liberal Arts will be added next year, and it is planned to restore the College of Medicine and add a Normal College in the future. Recently, the school's administrative conference passed an important resolution, namely to recommend that the Ministry of Education allow the school to adopt a group system under the department, in order to respond to various post-war needs. The following is the plan for grouping: The Department of Law of the College of Law is divided into two groups: Judicial and Administrative Law (according to the Ministry order), the Department of Political Science is divided into three groups: Theoretical Politics, Administration, and Diplomacy. The Department of Economics is divided into four groups: Public Finance, Finance, Accounting and Politics, and Economics. The Department of Agronomy of the College of Agriculture is divided into three groups: Crops, Agricultural Chemistry, and Plant Diseases and Insect Pests. The Department of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine is divided into two groups: Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine. The Department of Agricultural Economics is divided into two groups: Agricultural Economics and Agricultural Finance. The College of Engineering and other departments will add departments as appropriate, without separate groups. It is currently preparing a plan to report to the Ministry for review, and it can be implemented as soon as it is approved.

### Return Our Souls!

— Qiao Zheng

What does victory bring us? Eight years of pain under occupation make us feel sad and depressed. No matter how eloquent someone is, they can't bring back our broken hearts! We only feel empty and lost.

We are a group of pitiful apprentices, just like the students in schools. We are here to learn skills, but we live like slaves. We are like a group of monkeys, and the bosses and managers are like street performers who lead the monkeys. We shed blood and sweat for them, but they reap the benefits. We do things that are worse than what cattle and horses do, and we are still subjected to their scolding and even whipping. And the pocket money we get each month is not enough for them to buy a few packs of cigarettes! Every day we eat only leftovers!

The editorial in the newspaper said it well: "…Education is the foundation of construction, and we should pay attention to education. We agree that 'education first' should be the guiding principle…" During the eight years of war, the multiple sufferings made it difficult for us to breathe. We abandoned our books, left school, and engaged in the apprentice life that was discriminated against, doing things that were not as good as those of cattle and horses. Although we suffered materially, we were spiritually happy. Our hearts were filled with great ideals, hoping that victory would come soon so that we could have the opportunity to return to school and that the fire of light would warm our hearts. Now that victory has come, where is the fire of light? Our hearts are cold, our hopes have become bubbles. How can we not be heartbroken!

We only have obligations and no rights. We are also human beings! We are also raised by our parents, with flesh and blood, heads, eyes, noses, and mouths, but why do we have to live a life like cattle and horses? Why are our souls in the hands of others? We also have reason and emotion. Why should our freedom be controlled by others? We are not a group of "fatalists" who are at the mercy of others. We need to shout: Return our souls! We are also human beings!

### The Use of Time

— Xiaoshan

Time is our greatest asset and needs to be used well.

Use time to live. Time is originally for living. Wasting time is equal to not wanting to live -- suicide.

Use time to work. The first thing in life is work. Not working is a debt to life.

Use time to love. Life is "mutual", and you can never reach the end alone. Having many friends is a supreme honor.

Use time to think. Thought produces power, it will issue orders to you, and it will also issue orders to mankind.

Use time to play. Playing with the elderly, you will gain wisdom from their white hair; playing with children, children will wash away your hypocrisy; playing with young people, young people are fresh manufacturers.

### An Account That Cannot Be Settled

— Xu Yuqing

In pre-war and post-war debt relationships, if a lawsuit arises, the goals of both the plaintiff and the defendant are bound to be completely different, far apart, and the reasons of both sides are bound to be each saying they have a point, each with its own reason. If the country does not promulgate appropriate new laws, then the judicial officer will be very troubled, and both sides will feel that the judgment is unfair. Therefore, I advise creditors and debtors to not get involved in litigation. The following "account that cannot be settled" is a perfect example.

I have an acquaintance, an old woman, who deposited 1,000 yuan in legal tender in a rice shop in the year the War of Resistance began (autumn of the 26th year of the Republic, 1937). The interest rate was of course very low. The principal and interest were not withdrawn for several years. Later, that place was occupied, and the old woman retreated into the free area. She simply put this deposit out of her mind. After the fall of that area, because the puppet currency was in circulation, and two yuan of legal tender were only worth one yuan of puppet currency, all deposits and debts were settled and converted into puppet currency. Of course, the 1,000 yuan in legal tender deposited by the old woman, plus five or six hundred yuan in interest over the past two or three years, totaling one thousand five or six hundred yuan, was only worth seven or eight hundred yuan in puppet currency when converted at two to one. Last year, the enemy surrendered, and the old woman returned to her hometown. Because her circumstances were far worse than before, she sent someone to the rice shop to withdraw the deposit. The person in charge of the rice shop said that although the interest for previous years had been cleared, the interest for this year was still to be calculated and would be delivered tomorrow. After that person left, the accountant calculated that the old woman's deposit, including principal and interest, was less than 2,000 yuan in puppet currency, which was less than 10 yuan in legal tender. After the accountant reported this to the manager, the manager couldn't help but laugh and say, our accounts are based on vouchers and records, converted on time. There is nothing wrong with the logic, but when people deposited it was 1,000 yuan in legal tender, and now, after seven or eight years, the principal and interest together are less than 10 yuan in legal tender. You can say that people deposited 100 yuan in legal tender in our shop for seven or eight years, and we gave them one yuan in legal tender, including principal and interest. This is a big joke. Moreover, this depositor has a considerable relationship with this shop! However, when the accountant asked the manager how to settle the account, the manager just smiled and did not have a satisfactory solution. Finally, the manager instructed the accountant to extract a bill, showing a balance of one thousand several hundred several tens of yuan in puppet currency, and send it to the old woman. The old woman asked someone to carefully read it and explain how the legal tender was converted into puppet currency. When the old woman heard that what she had deposited was less than 10 yuan in legal tender, she immediately tore up the bill. She said that when I deposited 1,000 yuan in legal tender, the price of rice was only 9 yuan per stone, and 1,000 yuan in legal tender could buy more than 110 stones of rice. What is the use of 10 yuan now? I am poor now, what do I need it for?

This account that could not be settled was finally resolved by the rice shop manager giving the old woman three stones of rice, which was considered to have cleared the deposit, because both sides had emotional connections. However, the old woman was still saying behind her back, I am really unlucky, more than 110 stones of rice, deposited for seven or eight years, now only three stones are left. At the same time, the rice shop manager was also saying that the current price of rice is 5,000 yuan per stone (at that time the government stipulated that the price of rice was 5,000 yuan and the market price was about the same), three stones of rice totaled 15,000 yuan in legal tender, equivalent to 3 million yuan in puppet currency. A deposit of less than 2,000 yuan was repaid with 3 million yuan, an average of 1,500 yuan repaid for every one yuan deposited. It is really unspeakable suffering!

In such a peaceful resolution, the arguments of both sides are still clinging to their own views. If a lawsuit were to arise, how could both sides be satisfied?

### Water Transportation in Shanghai

— Yi Ming

Water conservancy, in addition to providing irrigation for fields, also occupies an important position in transportation. Just speaking of Shanghai, land transportation is very developed and can be considered the central hub of land routes in the Jiangnan area. However, what about waterways? Apart from ocean routes, there isn't much to praise. For example, the Suzhou Creek was originally the central hub of inland water transportation in Shanghai, flowing downstream to the Huangpu River and upstream to Suzhou. Unfortunately, the current Suzhou Creek is terribly polluted and blocked. Every day, except during high tide, the river surface suddenly becomes very narrow, making it difficult for ships to navigate. Although this is a minor matter, the impact of an ordinary issue on Shanghai's transportation and commerce cannot be ignored. I believe that to increase Shanghai's commercial prosperity and ensure smooth inland water transportation, the following two points must be noted:

(1) Dredging: When rivers are polluted and blocked, they must be dredged. Otherwise, they will accumulate day by day, the water will become shallow, making it difficult for boats to travel, hindering water transportation, and posing a risk of flooding upstream.

(2) Public Morality: While the pollution and blockage of rivers are often caused by siltation from upstream, it is also due to the public's disregard for public morality. Just looking at the banks of the Suzhou Creek, they are piled with garbage and similar things. This is a major root cause of the pollution and blockage of the Suzhou Creek. Therefore, to prevent the Suzhou Creek from being polluted and blocked, the people must prioritize public morality, and the authorities must also provide supervision and enforcement.

Hobbies

### Collecting Buttons

— Hong Guang

Today, besides stamp collecting and coin collecting, the third most popular hobby in the United States is button collecting. At the recent third annual meeting of the Los Angeles Button Club, over 200,000 types of buttons were on display, some worth hundreds of US dollars, but no one could estimate the value of the entire exhibition.

The popularity of button collecting has only miraculously risen in the last four years. However, it actually originated from an entertainment festival in 1890, when young girls collected buttons to make a game called "Lover's Knot." While making it, they had to be careful not to string nine hundred and ninety-nine identical buttons on a rope. Legend had it that whoever obtained one thousand identical buttons would remain an old maid forever. This hobby faded away soon after, but today, there are tens of thousands of button collectors throughout the United States. In California, there are junior button clubs specifically for children and young people. These buttons are mostly purchased from secondhand stores or pawnshops. The National Button Society, in order to make this hobby more scientific, has published an eighty-page quarterly magazine, publishing news about new or rare varieties.
