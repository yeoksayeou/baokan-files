### Chairman Encourages Peacemakers, Hopes for Continued Search for Solutions, New Proposals from Various Parties Suspended

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 29th Dispatch] After the new proposals painstakingly drafted by the Youth Party, the Democratic League, and social elites were automatically withdrawn on the 28th, the atmosphere here on the 29th has clearly shifted. Because the content of the proposals was not entirely consistent with the opinions of both sides, Chairman Chiang met with Huang Yanpei, Mo Dehui, and Xu Chuanlin (representing Zhang Junmai) at 9:30 a.m. on the 29th. At 11:30 a.m., he met again with Zeng Qi, Chen Qitian, and Li Huang, expressing his encouragement for their efforts and hoping they would continue to strive to find suggestions acceptable to both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. The representatives then held a meeting at Lanjiazhuang, each reporting on their audience with the Chairman and continuing to discuss ways to resolve the current situation. They gathered again for discussion at 3:00 p.m., and at 4:00 p.m., the entire group went to Sun Ke's residence. At that time, all the government representatives had also arrived, and a discussion was held. The Youth Party representatives announced that they did not intend to present the original new proposals. The discussion ended at 7:00 p.m. After the representatives returned to Lanjiazhuang and rested briefly, Communist Party representatives Dong Biwu and Li Weihan visited. In the evening, a reporter interviewed Liang Shuming, asking about the reasons for stopping the presentation of the new proposals. Liang said that the government side believed that it was acceptable not to present them for the time being. The reporter asked if he felt pessimistic. Liang believed that they would still make every effort to save the situation. Another meeting will be held at 3:00 p.m. on the 30th, and Zhou Enlai will be invited to attend to listen to his opinions and make a final effort to find a suitable path.

US Ambassador Concerned About Peace Talks While Ill, Fu Jingbo Visits Song and Sun

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 29th Dispatch] Ambassador Stuart, despite being ill, remains extremely concerned about the future of peaceful mediation.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 29th Dispatch] In recent days, as peace talks were approaching a turning point, the new proposals from the Democratic League and the Youth Party were submitted and then withdrawn. To find the main sticking point, the reporter inquired with various parties. Government representatives were evasive, and Democratic League representatives also responded with subtle attitudes. It is reported that the Communist Party was unwilling to accept, making it impossible for the mediators to mediate. Another foreign authority said: Although encountering infinite difficulties at present, one cannot jump to a pessimistic conclusion. When all seems lost, there will be a way out, and there may still be a good future. It is also heard that Special Envoy Marshall is still working on a mediation plan, and the Chairman is also extremely hopeful for mediation.

### Chairman Chiang Notifies the Entire Country, Hoping to Stop Extravagant Birthday Celebrations, Plans to Go to a Certain Place with His Wife to Avoid Birthday Festivities

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 29th Dispatch] Chairman Chiang and his wife are scheduled to go to a certain place on the 30th for inspection, in order to avoid birthday celebrations. The Chairman and his wife plan to travel by car and not by plane. It is said that they will return to Nanjing on November 1st or 2nd.

[Central News Agency Nanjing 29th Dispatch] Chairman Chiang's sixtieth birthday is approaching. In order to save manpower, material resources, and financial resources, the Chairman expressed his absolute unwillingness to have any extravagant celebrations. He telegraphed the entire country to reiterate this intention and specifically instructed the cessation of the construction of bronze statues and other such matters. The original telegram stated: "On Zhongzheng's sixtieth birthday, as time passes, I am deeply ashamed of not having fulfilled my duty to protect the country and save the people. I absolutely do not want any birthday celebrations, and I absolutely do not want any extravagant celebrations, which would waste manpower, material resources, and financial resources, and increase my personal faults. I had previously instructed Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng to declare this intention on my behalf. However, recently I have heard that many places are still constructing bronze statues or undertaking construction in the name of birthday celebrations, and some have even stipulated that each civil servant should contribute one day's income to cover the expenses. These bad habits, remnants of feudalism, are not what today's era should have, and greatly violate Zhongzheng's long-standing advocacy of thrift, integrity, and self-examination, and would be tantamount to placing Zhongzheng in an unjust position. Therefore, I am specially telegraphing to notify, hoping that everyone will immediately stop such activities and instruct all levels to stop such activities. Even regarding the donation for the construction of schools, it should only be voluntary, and the amount should never be stipulated, as it would resemble an assigned task. Today, the country has not yet been at peace for long, and our compatriots are suffering deeply. If all levels of government personnel and compatriots across the country could put themselves in Zhongzheng's shoes, they would know that he would never want any extravagant celebrations. This is not an ordinary modest refusal, but a sincere admonition. I hope that everyone will deeply understand this intention, quickly inform others, and reject any gifts from the Gu Gong Tuan and all compatriots."

[Our Newspaper Jinan 29th Dispatch] The Communist Army's 5th and 6th Columns and others, which again attacked Gaomi and Jiaoxian, have been bravely counterattacked by the National Army for days. By the 29th, the Communist Army's offensive had been frustrated and had fallen into a state of quiet.

Because the Communist Army's 5th and 6th Columns have been newly replenished and equipped with weapons transported from northern Shandong, they have launched another major offensive, attempting to cut off the Jiaoji Railway and reoccupy Gaomi in order to restore their communication line from the Northeast through Jiaodong to northern Jiangsu. The forces used include the 5th and 6th Columns, as well as about 50,000 local militia.

Another route, led by the 6th Column, together with more than 10,000 militia, attacked Gaomi from Tingkou, north of Gaomi, on the evening of the 26th.

[Our Newspaper Peiping 29th Dispatch] After the Jiaoji Railway was cleared by the National Army, the Communist Army's north-south communication in Shandong was cut off. A part of the main force of the New Fourth Army, which was isolated in the Liaodong Peninsula, in order to maintain the essence of the Shandong Communists and maintain contact with the Northeast Communist Army, is doing everything possible to strengthen the fortifications of key strongholds along the Shandong coast centered on Yantai, Weihaiwei, Penglai, and Longkou. Although there were rumors of battles near Yantai a few days ago, it has not been confirmed to date. Although the government's navy has already been dispatched, there is no definite news as to whether it has landed in Yantai. On land, in addition to one route of the National Army advancing north along the Jiaoji Railway to Pingdu, another route has advanced along the Laiyang-Yantai highway, but the progress has not been confirmed. According to a report from the relevant authorities, the Communist Army is actively building fortifications near Yantai. Longkou is easier to land on (the Japanese army landed there).

Nanguan Town between Huo County and other counties south of Jiexiu and north of Linfen have been recovered successively. However, the railway tracks and sleepers have been severely damaged, and the roadbed has also been extensively damaged, making it impossible to repair in the short term. Traffic will be temporarily maintained by highways. The few National Army troops north of Taiyuan have reached Guoxian and are continuing to advance north, but it is not yet known when they will be able to converge with the National Army in Huairen and Yingxian. The railway destruction in that section is also severe. Only the 120-mile section from Huangzhai to Xinxian may be completed by the end of this year, but automobiles can also pass. The Zhengtai Post Office is still open, but due to the war in Baoding, traffic between Ping and Jin is now only maintained by China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) flights.

[Our Tianjin Dispatch of the 29th] National troops on the Tongpu Railway are making continuous progress, and the northern section has reached Xiongzhou County and continues to advance, planning to converge with the National troops in Huairen and Yingxian and reach Datong directly. The northern and southern National troops in the southern section converged near Nanguan Station and are actively restoring traffic. However, due to a lack of railway materials, restoration is difficult, so highways are being used to maintain traffic first. The railway between Xinxian and Huangzhai in the northern section is expected to be repaired by the end of the year, and automobiles are already passing through.

[Our Beiping Dispatch of the 29th] According to official reports, data points near Yulin in northern Shaanxi have been captured by the Communist army. Several strong points in the suburbs of Yulin are also under intense attack by the Communist army. The Communist army in that area is well-equipped with light and heavy machine guns and mortars.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 29th] The Communist army in northern Shaanxi is actively attacking Yulin and Yang Puhas dispatched elite troops from various places to strengthen the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region and expand northward. The force besieging Xiangshuibao consisted of three regiments, which captured the area. The National Army was forced to retreat to Sancha Bay (ten kilometers south of Yulin). The Communist army is continuing its attack. In addition, a Communist army force of several thousand men has bypassed to Jialiesuerlin, about sixty kilometers northwest of Yulin, and is engaged in fierce fighting with the National Army there. More than a thousand Communist soldiers and more than five hundred militiamen have been discovered north of Shenmu County (northeast of Yulin). Near Zhangjiachuan, south of Shenmu, several hundred Communist soldiers were also discovered on the 21st, forcibly conscripting laborers, looting mules and horses, and extorting grain and money.

[Our Guisui Dispatch of the 28th] Communist troops have been discovered in the Huangcaoya area between Yulin and Shenmu. Local garrison troops are counterattacking and are currently in a stalemate. The Communist troops attempting to invade Yulin from Uxin Banner have been intercepted and cut off by the National Army. After the successive retreats from Zhenchuan, Wuzhen, Shiwang, Xiangshui and other places south of Yulin, the National Army is now defending the Guidebao line. Both sides are engaged in fierce fighting in Gaojiagou, Youfangtou and other places. The Communist army is launching a full-scale attack on Yulin, while the National Army has concentrated all its forces to counterattack, killing thousands of Communist soldiers.

The commander now defending Guidebao is Zhang Yunqu, who broke through Wayao Fortress and nearly captured Mao Zedong in the past. Zhang is intelligent and courageous and has been fighting the Communist army in various parts of northern Shaanxi for many years.

In addition to the announcement of various proposals, the original agenda included the draft legislative principles of the Central Bank Law and the China, Transportation, and Farmers' Bank Regulations. Due to time constraints and the need for thorough discussions, the cases of the official shares of China General Chamber of Commerce, China Industrial Corporation, China National Goods, and Ningbo Commercial & Savings Bank being repurchased by the government at net value were not fully discussed. Speaker Sun announced that a provisional session would be convened again on the morning of the 30th to submit them for discussion. Another case was the revision of Articles 3 and 4 of Article 16 of the Provincial Bank Regulations. Due to the importance of the matter, it was discussed for a long time without reaching a conclusion, and it was decided to refer it back for review. According to the relevant provincial governments and financial departments, and those involved in the personnel relations of the provincial banks, it is unanimously believed that the powers and responsibilities must be clearly defined, otherwise the provincial bank will become the provincial chairman's private treasury, and the provincial bank must accept unreasonable overdrafts and loans from the provincial government. At the same time, commercial relations are involved, and it is inevitable that collusion and profiteering will occur. The discussion was very heated, and it was decided to refer it back for review. As for the Central Bank Law and the legislative principles of the China, Transportation, and Farmers' Bank Regulations, the issue of whether the three banks, in addition to the central bank, should be state-owned or privately owned was discussed for a long time and there was much debate. In the end, due to the importance of the case, it was also referred to the discussion on the morning of the 30th.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] The Legislative Yuan held its 310th session on the morning of the 29th, chaired by Speaker Sun, to discuss the following items: (1) The report of the Economic Committee of this Yuan on the review of the proposal to amend the Regulations on the Operation of Weights and Measures Instruments by adding Article 5; (2) The report of the Criminal Law Committee of this Yuan on the review and revocation of the Regulations on the Handling of Theft; (3) The report of the Legislative Committee of this Yuan on the review of the draft regulations on the organization of the Central Epidemic Prevention Experimental Institute; the above three cases were resolved to be approved after review and amendment. (4) The report of the Legislative Committee of this Yuan on the amendment of the attached table to the Supplementary Regulations for the Election of National Assembly Representatives was resolved to be approved according to the review report. The method of generating candidates within the combined provinces listed in the attached table was amended to "elected by the provincial provisional council." (5) The report of the Finance Committee of this Yuan on the review of the national general expenditure budget for the 34th year of the Republic of China, the supplementary budget books for Anhui, Henan, Xia, Guangxi, Taiwan, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Shanxi, and Suiyuan provinces, and Nanjing, Beiping, and Qingdao cities, and the Guangxi Province budget for wiping out accounts, were resolved to be approved according to the review opinions. (6) The Finance Committee and the Economic Committee of this Yuan jointly reported on the review of the proposal to amend Articles 3 and 4 of Article 16 of the Provincial Bank Regulations, and it was resolved to refer it back for review.

Proposal to Adjust Salaries and Allowances of Civil Servants, Legislator Jian Guan San and Others Resubmit

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] Regarding the issue of adjusting the salaries and allowances of civil servants and teachers, at the regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 29th, legislators Jian Guansan, Liu Keshu, Jiao Zijin and others resubmitted the proposal, hoping to improve the situation as soon as possible. The proposal will be formally discussed at the provisional meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 30th. The reasons given are divided into five points: (1) Recently, President Song and the person in charge of the Central Bank stated in the newspapers that the issuance of legal currency in July did not increase, and although there was an increase after July, it was less than in the past, indicating that the financial situation has improved; (2) From the date of victory in September of last year to the end of October of this year, prices in Nanjing, Shanghai and other places have risen seventeen times, while the salaries and allowances of civil servants and teachers have only increased by an average of seven times. The disparity is so great that life is becoming increasingly difficult; (3) According to the cost of living index for civil servants and teachers in Nanjing, it was 7,780 times higher in the first ten days of October and 7,920 times higher in the middle ten days of October, while the salaries and living allowances of civil servants and teachers, combined, have not yet reached 1,000 times. With such meager treatment, how can employees serve with peace of mind? (4) Recently, newspapers reported that civil servants have committed suicide due to poverty, and teachers have stopped teaching due to hunger. If living conditions are not quickly improved, the situation will become unmanageable in the future; (5) According to precedent, the salaries and allowances of civil servants and teachers are adjusted every three months, and the adjustment period has arrived. The Executive Yuan should publish improvement measures as soon as possible based on the improved financial situation and rising prices to comfort the expectations of civil servants and teachers.

### Our Food Supply Situation, Due to the Extent of Disaster Areas and the Small Amount of Relief Arriving, Will Inevitably Remain Slightly Difficult for the Next Year, Authoritative Sources Speak

[Our Report] After the Director of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) issued a statement on the severity of the food shortage in our country, authoritative sources told our reporter: We are very grateful for the Director of UNRRA's well-intentioned concern regarding the food problem in our country. As far as the food situation this year is concerned, the cultivated areas have had a relatively good harvest, but due to the instability of the political situation and other reasons, there is still a considerable area of disaster areas, especially in Central China. In addition, the loss of farm cattle during the Anti-Japanese War was severe, estimated at more than 20 million head, and there has been no substantial replenishment, which has greatly affected cultivation efficiency. Speaking of international relief, we are of course grateful for the kindness of friendly countries, but due to transportation difficulties, the quantity of supplies arriving in China is very small. For example, in terms of fertilizer, UNRRA originally planned to ship 320,000 tons, but only 30,000 tons have actually arrived, and at most 50,000 tons can be reached this year. In terms of tractors, it was originally planned to ship 2,000, but in fact only 36 have arrived, which is absolutely insufficient for distribution given the extent of the disaster areas in our country. In addition, only 1,000 boxes of plows have arrived, far from the original quota. Due to the above reasons, the supply of food will inevitably remain slightly difficult for the next year. In the future, we can only increase the cultivated area domestically, increase the output of farm cattle, and hope that UNRRA can provide our country with a large and rapid supply of fertilizer and farming machinery. Then the prospects for our country's food problem can be optimistic.

10,000 Tons of Rice Shipped to Guangxi for Public Works and Relief

[Another Report] The relief work of the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) is being actively carried out in remote Guangxi. Recently, the General Office has allocated more than 12,000 tons of relief rice to carry out public works and relief in Guangxi, of which 6,163 tons are specifically for the food of workers repairing highways, 3,945 tons are specifically for the construction of farmland water conservancy, and 2,030 tons are designated as food for workers repairing city streets. Nanning and Wuzhou have begun to clean up the streets and build new-style toilets. The appearance of the two cities is expected to change soon.

Opening of Kowloon Port Can Be Implemented in the Short Term

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 29th] The CRRRA believes that the recovered areas of Guangdong, Hunan, and Guangxi urgently need relief, but inland and coastal transportation are extremely difficult. After relief supplies arrive in Shanghai, they are stored in docks and warehouses. Although the warehouses are full, there is no way to transport them south. Therefore, it has requested the opening of South China ports so that ships carrying relief supplies can dock and unload, which is conducive to relief efforts. According to reliable news, this matter has been approved by the authorities, and the Kowloon port will be opened as a special port for relief supplies. The government has instructed the Ministry of Finance to order the customs to handle it accordingly on the 27th, and it will be officially implemented in the short term.

### United Nations Economic and Social Council Sends Delegation to China

### Sino-Japanese Barter Trade Method Principally Decided, Details Awaiting Consultation; Japan Exchanges Transportation Equipment and Machinery for Our Country's Salt

[Our Report] The Sino-Japanese barter trade method for next year has been largely decided in principle after relevant personnel went to Japan for consultation, and the details remain to be consulted. Transportation equipment will be the top priority of the goods Japan exports to China next year, because Japan has a considerable amount of storage of this during the war, and the lost industries have gradually been repaired and can now be produced. However, Japan lacks coal and iron, and negotiations are currently underway, hoping that our country can supply these two raw materials. The resources second only to transportation equipment to be exported to China will be machinery, including spinning machines that our country urgently needs. Because Japan's current exports are generally managed by Americans, transactions are limited to government-to-government transactions; the distribution of Japanese exports is determined by the governments of various countries in negotiations with the Science and Economic Group of the Allied General Headquarters in Tokyo. Exports to China are only a fixed quota of Japan's exports to various countries, and its decision is not purely a matter for the two countries. As for the goods that our country exports to Japan next year, salt accounts for the first place, probably 1 million to 1.2 million tons. Most of this salt is used by the Japanese chemical industry as a raw material, and the selling price is purely calculated based on cost, because if profit is added, the price will be too high and the other party will switch to buying salt from other countries. According to the Ministry of Salt Affairs, in terms of the production and sales of salt in our country, it is definitely possible to find a way to supply this surplus salt. In addition, Japan also hopes that our country will supply a certain resource produced in the north, which we are still considering. According to relevant sources, the Allied General Headquarters in Tokyo is very willing to greatly increase the amount of barter trade due to the geographical proximity between China and Japan.

### Many Japanese Women in Northeast Marry Chinese Men, Leading to Many Divorce Cases

Authorities Are Properly Seeking Disposal Methods

[Our Changchun Dispatch of the 28th] According to the authorities, after the end of the repatriation of Japanese prisoners in the city, the current number of Japanese people remaining in Changchun is 6,867, including retained technical personnel and their families, as well as Japanese women married to Chinese men. Recently, many people have filed for divorce, mostly because after the recovery of the Northeast, Japanese women who fled here from other places were unable to find food and clothing and were forced to marry Chinese men. However, they were discovered by the original wives, and their lives became unstable. The authorities are properly seeking disposal methods for such disputes.

### More Than 500 Displaced Overseas Chinese Returning from Europe Arrive in Shanghai

Most Are from Zhejiang Province and Will Return to Their Hometowns

[This City News] Five hundred and forty-two displaced overseas Chinese refugees sent back by UNRRA arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon on the French ship Saint Saëns. Many relatives and friends of the overseas Chinese came to the scene to welcome them when the ship docked at the old Ningbo Wharf in the city. Most of the overseas Chinese returning this time are from Qingtian County, Zhejiang Province, and come from Italy and Germany. Among them are sixty European Chinese wives. During the war, overseas Chinese were abused and imprisoned in Axis concentration camps. After the war, they were rescued by UNRRA and sent back to China. They set sail from Europe on September 20 and arrived in Hong Kong on October 14. They took the Saint Saëns to Shanghai. After disembarking, some of the refugees went to the CRRRA reception centers on Difeng Road and in the Southern District of the city for temporary accommodation. Most of the Zhejiang refugees transferred to the CRRRA refugee ship Chuanshan and sailed to Wenzhou, their hometown.

Zhang Jia'ao Delivers Speech at Banquet

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 28th] Zhang Jia'ao delivered a speech at a banquet for the business delegation on the evening of the 28th, emphasizing the importance of the Northeast for international trade. He stated: The three northeastern provinces have the richest natural resources in China's economic geography. In the future, they can produce a large number of exports. At the same time, for certain commodities, especially industrial and transportation equipment, they are particularly needed during this post-war period and during the reconstruction. The industrial equipment in the Northeast has been affected by the war, and valuable equipment has either been destroyed or removed. Now only the dilapidated shells remain. The most urgent task now is to rebuild. We hope that friendly international assistance will quickly transport machinery and equipment to compensate for the destroyed and removed losses. Therefore, the rapid restoration of international trade is most needed. Zhang continued: Northeast commerce is by no means one-sided. It can only take from people and is not enough to help people, because the materials and raw materials here, such as soybeans, oilseeds (such as perilla), iron from Anshan Benxi, coal from Fushun Fushun, and magnesium from Liaoning Dashiqiao (the world's largest magnesium mine) are all urgently needed by various countries.

Editorial: The Unignorable Revival of Japan
According to Agence France-Presse, London, 28th, the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union are scheduled to meet in New York on the 4th of next month to discuss issues related to the control of Japan by Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, General MacArthur. Meanwhile, after investigating Japanese industrial combines, the US delegation also released a report stating: The industrial combine system, where the zaibatsu still control vast wealth and economic power, wields an economic influence that surpasses any capitalist industrialized nation. Therefore, the continued existence of its potential power is enough to prevent the revival of Japan's war industry potential. The release of this report is not only a serious warning to the Far Eastern Commission but also indicates that the Allied policy for controlling Japan needs to be seriously reviewed.

Recalling when Japan surrendered a year ago, it was mired in the dark and tragic depths, causing the people of the entire country to worry about the darkness of the future. Even the most stubborn Japanese, though deluded, still did not admit defeat but could not help but reveal a state of anxiety and confusion. Unexpectedly, a year later, the defeated Japanese Empire is vigorously and silently reviving day and night, and the people of the entire country are expressing positive optimism. They have not only seen clearly the international contradictions after the war and predicted the future of China but also recognized the weaknesses of American policy and regained confidence in Japan's position in the Far East. Therefore, in recent months, the fantasies that have appeared before the eyes of the Japanese people have emerged endlessly. Although most of them are ludicrous and shameless dreams, the continued improvement of Japan's domestic economic situation and the rekindling of its potential power make it impossible for us not to raise our vigilance.

First, there are the Japanese people's fantasies about the future peace treaty: After the Paris Peace Conference passed the draft peace treaties for Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland, it immediately ignited great hope among the Japanese, who believed that the future was promising. Prominent figures in society even printed a secret document, which they circulated privately. The content listed the demands Japan would make to the peace conference: (1) In terms of territory, Japan wants to obtain trusteeship over the Ryukyu Islands; (2) In terms of economy, it wants to obtain fishing rights in Soviet territorial waters; (3) To make the great powers believe that Japan truly has peaceful intentions and to request that all countries be generous and not impose harsh conditions on Japan; (4) To request that the Allied countries allow Japan to immediately resume foreign trade and that Mitsubishi Corporation directly communicate with foreign commercial firms; (5) To request that the Allied countries consider Japan's reasonable demands in politics and economics.

Second, there are the Japanese people's fantasies about US-Soviet relations: In the minds of the Japanese, they have long believed that a US-Soviet war is unavoidable. Especially since May of this year, rumors about war have filled all levels of Japanese society, and they have almost completely entrusted Japan's future destiny to the conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union. Everyone believes that when a US-Soviet war breaks out, it will be the time for a defeated Japan to make a major comeback. Therefore, in peacetime, whenever the Japanese hear news of discord between the United States and the Soviet Union, they are overjoyed, believing that the day for a major comeback is coming. At the same time, they do their utmost to sow discord in front of the Americans, making the United States also believe that Japan is its friend and the Soviet Union is its enemy, and that it can be given important tasks in the future. Even the American representative of the Control of Japan Committee said, "The goals of the United States and Japan have actually become consistent." The complete success of Japan's diplomacy towards the United States can also be clearly demonstrated here. At the same time, if we review MacArthur's policy of controlling Japan, we cannot help but say that it is too lenient. The rapid revival of Japan, the endless stream of Japanese fantasies, and the optimism revealed everywhere are all due to MacArthur's relaxation of control.

Third, there are the Japanese people's fantasies about the United Kingdom and the United States: Although Japan has done its utmost to flatter the United States, striving for American goodwill and sympathy, it has not forgotten the old friendship of the past Anglo-Japanese alliance with the United Kingdom, constantly flirting secretly and even attempting to sow discord between the United Kingdom and the United States. For example, recently, British Foreign Secretary Bevin reported on foreign policy in the House of Commons, also stating that a lasting peace should be created with Japan. The Japanese were flattered and believed that Bevin's words implied that the British government hoped to immediately restore Anglo-Japanese trade and bring the United States' termination of trade with Japan to an end. Even an official of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: "Japan has become a stage for the political contest between the United States and the Soviet Union, and now it will also become a place for the economic competition between the United Kingdom and the United States." The underlying meaning is self-evident.

Regarding Japan's attempt to restore its foreign trade, it has indeed gained the sympathy of the United Kingdom. When the British House of Commons discussed the issue of Japan, Conservative MP Stanley asked Secretary of Commerce Cripps, "Will Japan revive quickly?" Cripps immediately replied: "Japan's overseas industries will be confiscated by the United Nations and distributed to the countries invaded by Japan; but Japan's foreign trade should be allowed to recover, especially textiles, which are very scarce in Southeast Asia and cannot be transported from other places. Japan's textiles should be transported to supply them. However, the future strength of Japanese industry must not be allowed to engage in aggression again and should be restricted. All steel, heavy machinery, chemical industries, aircraft manufacturing, and other metal industries should be highly restricted." This remark is also worth pondering. Does the rapid revival of Japanese industry foreshadow a crisis of war? It is indeed a serious issue that cannot be ignored.

Fourth, there are the Japanese people's fantasies about peace: The Allied control authorities have repeatedly declared that the goal of controlling Japan is to disarm Japan, make it no longer able to engage in aggression, and become a peace-loving country. Therefore, the Japanese have tried every means to make the great powers unanimously recognize it as a truly peace-loving country, thereby relaxing the scope of control. Recently, Japanese cultural figures held a current affairs symposium. Ma Chang, the chief writer of the Yomiuri Shimbun, made a strange argument. He said: "For the sake of creating world peace, the United Nations should store a batch of atomic bombs in Japan and task peace-loving Japan with keeping them, because the main crisis at present is due to the existence of atomic bombs. Since the new Japanese constitution has stipulated the renunciation of the right to wage war, the United Nations should recognize its peaceful intentions and give Japan the right to keep atomic bombs." Although this strange argument is absurd and ridiculous, it also contains a lot of poison and cannot be ignored.

In short, Japan's gradual revival, its vigorous progress day and night, and the fact that a defeated Japan will once again be a key player on the Far Eastern stage, and that the commodities it manufactures will once again flood the world market are all true. Although the fantasies it currently holds all seem ludicrous and ridiculous, its national power is growing silently, which is a serious warning to our victorious China. The Far East, which has only been over a year since the end of the war, will once again be threatened by it. We cannot but appeal loudly to the United Kingdom and the United States that the Allied policy for controlling Japan needs to be reviewed again; we should be especially alert to Japan's ambitions to prevent them from being realized.

The Northern Jiangsu Inspection Delegation is About to Depart; Jointly Organized by the Jiangsu Provincial Council and Various Agencies; Establishing Guidelines to Universally Inspect Various Situations
〔Our Correspondent, Zhenjiang〕The Jiangsu Provincial Provisional Council, considering that the counties in Northern Jiangsu have been recovered one after another, decided to organize a Northern Jiangsu Recovered Area Inspection Delegation in conjunction with relevant agencies to understand the situation in the recovered areas. They also planned to start inspecting various places in Northern Jiangsu in November. It is now learned that, to deeply understand the situation in all aspects of the recovered areas and provide a basis for policy implementation, the delegation has specially established inspection guidelines, which are recorded as follows: (1) The situation of arson and murder by the communist army and the disasters suffered by the local people; (2) How to provide relief to refugees in the recovered areas, the sources of relief materials, the distribution situation, and the most urgent relief needs at present; (3) The discipline of the national army when entering the area and whether it gives the people a good impression; (4) Whether the facilities after the county government's governance are in line with the people's expectations, and whether the township and village baojia organizations can be completed quickly; (5) How to raise local government funds at present; (6) Whether the local self-defense force has been organized and whether it can exert its strength to eliminate lurking elements in the countryside; (7) What actions the refugees returning to their hometowns take after returning, and whether there are conflicts with the people who originally stayed in the communist area, and whether the local government and party groups can convey the central government's generous intentions to prevent retaliatory behavior by the people; (8) Whether the land reorganization measures formulated by the government in the pacification area recently can gain the support of all levels, and whether there are disputes between landlords and tenants in the recovered area; (9) After the "resistance currency" is discontinued, whether the Central Bank has devoted itself to stabilizing financial measures in the recovered area, and whether the legal currency is sufficient for circulation; (10) Whether the restoration of transportation in the recovered area can achieve military and political tasks; (11) Whether there are linked organizations between party groups, military administration, and public opinion institutions.

〔Our Correspondent, Zhenjiang〕After the counties in Northern Jiangsu were recovered, there were still many refugees stranded in various places awaiting relief and return to their hometowns. The Executive Yuan's Jiangsu-Nanjing Branch has now decided to send them back to their hometowns immediately, and has jointly handled this matter with the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Conference and the Social Rehabilitation Office. They are currently negotiating for ships and will set up stations in Zhenjiang and Yangzhou to handle the matter exclusively. It is tentatively decided to first send refugees from Gaoyou, Baoying, Huai'an, Huaiyin, Lianshui, and Siyang counties back to their hometowns. The refugees will register with the local association and wait for orders to be organized into teams. Refugees from Huai'an, Huaiyin, Siyang, and Lianshui counties in Zhenjiang and Yangzhou will be sent to Huaiyin by ships from Zhenjiang and Yangzhou, respectively. Those who are from Gaoyou and Baoying counties will return to their hometowns on their own, and the dispatch station set up by the branch will issue travel expenses. The branch has already telegraphed various strongholds in Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Taizhou, and Nantong, starting registration on October 30. Refugees in Zhenjiang will be registered by the joint office of the Northern Jiangsu Counties Post-War Relief Association. Refugees in other places such as Suzhou and Wuxi will be handled by the local association. As for refugees from other counties in Northern Jiangsu, it will be handled as the situation permits.

〔Our Correspondent, Zhenjiang, October 29〕The Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Conference held its seventh meeting on the 28th, chaired by Gu Zhenggang, and resolved (1) to allocate 200 million yuan to handle the matter jointly with the Jiangsu-Nanjing Branch; (2) to allocate 200 million yuan to assist winter cultivation in the recovered areas, and to allocate 200 million yuan to be reserved for emergency assistance in the unrecovered areas; (3) to use labor relief to build the Shuangjing Road to the riverside road, and change it to the Northern Jiangsu Road.

Except for those exempted from service as stipulated by the Military Service Law, all eligible strong men shall be listed and numbered. The heads of the local agencies shall be gathered to seal and stamp the roster in person and preserve it properly. Next, the personnel handling military service shall prepare ballots based on the numbers in the roster and invite local heads to draw lots and announce the names in designated locations on a regular basis to determine the names of the strong men to be drafted. The above methods cannot be changed to eliminate malpractice.

〔Our Correspondent, Hangzhou〕Each bao in this city has convened a Bao People's Congress to appoint representatives to be responsible for the review of the application for exemption from military service. It is now entering the review stage of the district offices. The municipal government also sends personnel to each district to participate in the review meeting to show seriousness.

In addition, according to the telegram from the Zhejiang Provincial Military Region, those who have not applied for exemption from military service due to certain reasons can still apply for supplementary processing. A deadline will be given based on the actual situation. If it is overdue again, it will be regarded as a waiver.

〔Our Correspondent, Jiaxing〕This county's conscription service has already specified the quota, totaling 555 people, which means that two people are drawn from every three bao.

The medium wave section targets the city and southeastern provinces. The current transmitters are 1.5 kilowatts and 4 kilowatts. Some of the new 50-kilowatt equipment has arrived, and soon the city will have a powerful radio station. The station's programming emphasizes education, aiming to correct the current atmosphere of general radio stations.

[Another Report] The Shanghai Radio Station recently ordered new "Walkie Talkies" from the United States.

Quit Smoking Early

Those Who Reoffend After the General Crackdown Will Be Executed

·Liu Xuehai Reports on the Latest Developments in Drug Prohibition·

[Our Newspaper] Since the victory, the government has been making every effort to eradicate drugs. In addition to successively promulgating the "Measures for Clearing Up Drugs After the Victory," the "Measures for Clearing Up Drugs in Recovered Areas," and the revised "Regulations for Punishing Drug Prohibition and Drug Trafficking," it has also divided the country into nine drug prohibition zones and established special commissioners' offices to be responsible for supervision, assessment, planning, and coordination. Liu Xuehai, the special commissioner for the Jiangsu and Shanghai zone, recently came to Shanghai and held a reception for the press at the Haig Road Youth Center yesterday afternoon to report on the latest developments in drug prohibition. He also stated that the future direction of promoting drug eradication will focus on the following points: (1) Expanding publicity efforts, (2) Mobilizing social sanctions, (3) Strengthening investigations, (4) Encouraging reports, (5) Universally implementing detoxification and verification, (6) Strengthening the baojia organization, (7) Providing relief for drug addicts. Finally, Liu hopes that the press and citizens will provide more publicity and assistance so that drugs can be eradicated as soon as possible. In this city, the original deadline for detoxification and verification was from January to June of this year, but as of now, only 6,000 drug addicts have registered. Therefore, it is planned to consult with the municipal government to appropriately extend the deadline, and then implement a general crackdown. If anyone is found re-offending, they will be executed. As for those in the upper classes or those with potential influence who use drugs, if they are found to be true, they will not be tolerated, either.

Responding to Readers

Medicine and Health

(1) Deafness After Serious Illness

Wang Dewen Asks: Last winter, I suffered from typhoid fever, with high fever and delirium, and lost hearing in both ears. I have recovered for half a year, and my body has long returned to normal, but my ears are still not sensitive. I don't know why? How should I treat it?

[Dr. Gu Yuqi Replies] It is best to ask an otolaryngologist to carefully check if there are any functional changes in your ears after deafness due to typhoid fever.

(2) Swollen and Sore Gums

Wang Yimin Asks: My wife is 38 years old and has suffered from gum disease for two years. Her gums are swollen and sore, sometimes occurring and sometimes healing. The location is in the two side teeth. When it occurs, the teeth float up and can be shaken. The gums are swollen, rotten, and can last for four or five days before healing, but the gums shrink, the tooth necks are exposed, and she is unable to chew, making her suffer. At first, only one tooth was affected, but now it has affected four teeth, and two teeth have fallen out. A closer inspection reveals that the teeth have no cavities and are as complete as usual. Is it due to a lack of vitamin C? How should it be treated?

[Dr. Gu Yuqi Replies] According to the situation described in the letter, it is likely that the gums are inflamed or the roots are also decayed. You should consult a dental expert for a detailed examination and treatment.

(3) Hemorrhoids and Bloody Stools

Zhu Jian Asks: I am 31 years old and not yet married. Six years ago, I suffered from typhoid fever, and after recovering, I developed a symptom of bloody stools. At first, it was very severe, and the discharge looked like urine. Because I lived in the countryside at that time, it was difficult to find a good doctor, so I did not seek treatment. After a few months, it healed on its own and did not occur for one or two years. However, since the winter before last year, I have consistently had bright red blood flowing out after bowel movements. Although the amount is small, it has not stopped for a single day and has caused anal prolapse. Although there is no pain, it still feels uncomfortable when standing or walking. I have tried many treatments without success. I don't know what disease it is. Please tell me the treatment method.

[Dr. Gu Yuqi Replies] This is hemorrhoids. You must first make the stool soft and moist. You can eat more dates, water spinach, cooked apples, and butter, etc. At the same time, you can use Anusol suppositories, inserted into the anus half an hour before bowel movements. If it still does not heal, you must consult a surgeon for surgical treatment.

Flour Mills Suspend Operations Due to Lack of Raw Materials

Mayor Summons Factory Owners for Discussion

Factory Owners Propose Both Temporary and Permanent Solutions

[Our Newspaper] Nineteen large and small flour mills in the city have suspended operations due to a lack of raw materials, a situation that is quite serious. Mayor Wu specifically summoned representatives from five major flour mills, including New, , Hua , Maoxin, and Yutong, for a discussion at 10:00 AM yesterday. The representatives present were Zhu Maoqiu, , Rong Yiren, Zongjun, Xi , and five others. Mayor Wu inquired in detail about the issues of purchasing wheat and resuming operations. He stated that the Ministry of Food has allocated 5,000 tons of wheat to the flour mills and will try to ensure it is distributed next month. During this period of shortage, he hopes that the mills can purchase wheat from the suburbs to meet immediate needs. It is reported that Mayor Wu, considering the actual situation, agreed to re-examine flour prices and make a unified decision. The representatives then reported on their difficulties, divided into temporary and permanent solutions: (1) Temporary solutions: first, purchase domestic wheat and resume operations. However, the market price of domestic wheat is much higher than that of imported wheat. Before the national adjustment, it was only around 20,000 yuan per shih (石), but recently it once rose to 36,000 yuan. Since the ban on wheat exports, it has still been between 28,000 and 30,000 yuan. If each shih of wheat produces 75 jin (市斤) of flour, the cost per bag (44 jin) is about 20,000 yuan. Therefore, before imported wheat arrives, flour prices must be adjusted, and then lowered after imported wheat is supplied to Shanghai, rather than the current price of 13,900 yuan per bag. (2) Permanent solutions: it is necessary to order a large supply of imported wheat, as the output of domestic wheat is limited. Before the war, imported wheat was also needed during this period. Moreover, the market price of imported wheat is low, about 18,000 to 19,000 yuan per shih, and it produces more flour than domestic wheat. If precautions are not taken, our flour mills will not be able to survive. Mayor Wu agreed to convey the representatives' opinions to President Song. At the same time, in order to understand the actual situation of flour production, consumption, and sales in the city, Mayor Wu will convene representatives from flour mills, noodle shops, biscuit factories, paste factories, and flour merchants for a joint meeting at 5:00 PM today, and will also invite customs officials to attend in order to discuss the implementation of the ban on flour and wheat smuggling.

Black Market for US Dollars Not Eliminated

Central Bank Plans to Address the Situation

The official exchange rate for foreign currency is fixed, but the black market rate is still around 4,150 yuan to 4,200 yuan, slightly higher than before. The exchange rate against gold is around 548 yuan per liang. The Central Bank and the municipal government had previously established temporary measures for buying and selling US dollars, but the black market is still above 4,000 yuan. The Central Bank authorities are paying close attention to this and are currently planning a comprehensive solution, while also being in contact with foreign parties. The specific measures have not yet been finalized.

[Another Report] In order to completely eliminate the black market, the Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank has formulated measures to dismantle the telephones of money changers found to be operating illegally in the foreign currency black market. Their announcement reads as follows: "The buying and selling of foreign currency is originally operated by approved firms, and the price is stipulated not to exceed 5% of the bank's telegraphic transfer rate, which has been announced. Recently, it has been found that various banks and money changers in the city and their employees are still privately buying and selling, using telephones for black market transactions, which is a violation of regulations and should be strictly prohibited in order to comply with regulations. In the future, once such violations are discovered, in addition to severe punishment, the public security authorities will be reported to dismantle their telephones."

Hong Kong dollar Exchange Rates
The Hong Kong dollar recovered from 900 yuan, returning to the mainland, resulting in a drop of five yuan compared to the previous recovery. The Hong Kong dollar rose to 112 yuan due to Shanghai's electricity recovery. Yesterday, it was offered at 905 yuan with no demand. Indian exchange rates were offered at 1,085 yuan with supply. British exchange rates were around 14,200 yuan, with few transactions. The official exchange rate for US dollars did not change.

Gold Prices Rise

The price of gold recovered and stabilized yesterday. It opened at 2.277 million in the morning. The Central Bank exerted some pressure, gradually declining from 2.282 million. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank distributed 100 bars at 2.2725 million, and the low price was seen at 2.271 million. However, speculators continued to predict rising prices, and buyers were continuous, so the price was pulled up again. The supply gradually decreased, and the price rose to 2.29 million at noon. In the afternoon, the price continued to rise slightly to above 2.29 million for next-day delivery, resulting in an increase of 11,000 compared to the previous recovery. The prices of gold ornaments and standard silver at silver shops were stable. Silver dollars rose slightly. The interbank lending rate tightened slightly, and interest rates rose to 1.2 to 1.6 jiao (角).

Government Bonds Fall

Yesterday, a major player sold government bonds for 7 , but there were few transactions, and the price continued to decline slightly. Tong Bing (統丙) opened at 1,950 yuan in the morning, and Fuyuan (福源) and others sold, dropping the price to 1,800 yuan before stabilizing, and finally hovering around 1,850 yuan, resulting in a decrease of 50 yuan compared to the previous recovery. Jia (甲), Yi (乙), and Ding (丁) did not change. Tong Wu (統戊) rose slightly by 20 yuan. The face value of the traded bonds was more than 3 million yuan.

Ministry of Finance Orders Crackdown on Usury

With usury rampant, industry and commerce are unable to bear the burden and are suffering greatly. The Ministry of Finance recently issued an order to strictly crack down on it. The original telegram reads as follows: "The Ministry has already formulated the Regulations on the Management of Interest Rates for Financial Institutions, which have been submitted to the Executive Yuan and forwarded to the National Government for promulgation and implementation. According to the regulations, the lending rates of banks should be determined by the local banking and money industry associations, and the maximum limit should be reported to the local Central Bank for approval and public announcement. In order to curb the rise in market interest rates, the Ministry has instructed the Central Bank to use financial power to gradually stabilize market interest rates in accordance with the regulations on the management of interest rates, and to appropriately lower them when approving bank interest rates in order to alleviate the people's difficulties. If there are still banks and money lenders in various places who engage in usury in violation of the regulations, or establish various pretexts outside the approved interest rate to engage in exploitation, they should be strictly cracked down on. In addition to requesting the Central Bank to instruct its branches in various places to pay attention to inspection and report violations at any time for processing, you are hereby informed." The Audit Department of the Central Bank has issued a circular to its branches in various places to comply with the order.

Gauze and Cloth are Generally Weak

Double-Strand Thread Sees a Unique Rise

Prices of Various Textile Products Drop by a Small Amount of 1,000 Yuan

[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the yarn market saw thread prices rise while yarn prices were weak. The prices of various brands of 10-count yarn saw mixed fortunes, fluctuating between 100 and 200 yuan. Yarn below 16-count saw a decline, and sales were extremely sluggish. 42-count double-strand yarn was bought up by sock factories, leading to a rise of 50,000 to 70,000 yuan, likely due to a shortage in the industry. 42-count Blue Phoenix and Water Moon yarns were initially offered at 3.56 million to 3.57 million yuan, but later rose to 3.62 million yuan. 20-count Extra Double Horse yarn once rose to 2.36 million to 2.37 million yuan, but ultimately declined to 2.32 million yuan due to limited demand. 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn was sold for 2.15 million yuan.

Cotton cloth also showed no improvement, with sales remaining sluggish. Most dyeing factories believe that the peak sales season has passed, and work is entering a period of rest. There is little demand for various types of fine cloth. Trumpet Child 12-pound fine cloth is offered at 76,500 yuan, while Blue Chicken is offered at 80,000 yuan. Textile Construction prices have also been adjusted, with various types reduced by a small amount of 1,000 yuan. Dragon Head fine cloth is 83,000 yuan, while Yanghe Blue Phoenix is 86,000 yuan. However, White Printed Four Gentlemen pique remains fixed at 89,000 yuan, with very few offers. There is also little inter-industry trading. In summary, general purchasing power is weak, sales in various regions are sluggish, and cloth prices are difficult to improve.

The 9th Meeting of the Textile Management Committee Will Be Held Tomorrow Afternoon

[Our Newspaper] The Textile Industry Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs will convene its 9th plenary committee meeting at 3:00 PM tomorrow afternoon. In addition to discussing the joint distribution of yarn and cloth, the re-examination data of the registered manufacturers of yarn and cloth for southern transport, if it can be completed today, will also be submitted to the meeting for review.

Rice Prices Stop Falling and Start Rising, Vegetable Oil Supply Falls Short of Demand

The rice market is declining downstream, and production and sales are inverted. Shops are taking advantage of the situation to increase purchases, leading to a stronger digestive capacity. Japonica rice has rebounded by more than 1,000 yuan, and indica rice has increased by 2,000 yuan, but white dollar rice has not changed. The overall trend is a large drop followed by a small rise. Soybean demand is moving but not strong. Northeast soybeans are softening, while Central Plains soybeans are stable. Bean cake has turned sluggish due to Taiwan and Shantou announcing shutdowns, dropping by 300 to 500 yuan. Bran sales remain sluggish, dropping by another 100 to 200 yuan. The supply of broad beans is decreasing, sales are average, and prices remain high. Broad beans are sold as soon as they arrive, and the market is firm. Raw peanuts sales are neither strong nor weak, and there are no price fluctuations. Sesame sales to Southeast Asia are not being followed up, and prices are struggling to rise. High-quality goods tend to be stable, while mid-quality goods are softening. Adzuki beans have stabilized after falling. The vegetable oil market has become more active, with the supply of vegetable oil falling short of demand, rebounding by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Market trends are volatile and difficult to grasp. Soybean oil supply is still available and remains average. Rapeseed oil and clear oil have not changed.

Most of the bank's original overseas branches, except those in Southeast Asia, have resumed operations. In Southeast Asia, branches in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Penang, and Batavia have also reopened. Recently, a branch will be established in Bangkok to promote overseas remittance business. The amount of overseas remittances

Loser Shao Fu

A tragic incident occurred in Changzhou: a competition between rickshaws and cars resulted in one death, seven injuries, the destruction of one car, and one shop. The situation was so severe that police were deployed and traffic was cut off before order was restored. A similar event, though not on such a grand scale, occurred not long ago in Jiangwan, Pudong.

Times are merciless, reality is cruel, and scientific progress is rapidly changing. No one can stop it. The competition between rickshaws and cars can be seen as an inevitable tragedy in the transition between old and new eras. This tragedy is common everywhere. When railroads were built in the American West, horse-drawn carriages once fought against trains. But it goes without saying that the losers will never be on the side of progress.

Some years ago, it is said that the great Indian poet Tagore came to China. He did not ride in a car because he opposed mechanical civilization; nor did he ride in a rickshaw because he considered it inhumane. So he had to ride in a horse-drawn carriage. If someone today were to completely oppose mechanical civilization, they would probably find it difficult to live even for a day.

Shanghai rickshaws have been slated for gradual elimination. The first step is to convert them into single-person tricycles, which is another compromise. It has its reasons during the transitional period before the entire country is industrialized. Foreign friends often wonder why Chinese things are often not thorough and emphasize compromise. This is because they do not understand the relationship between the doctrine of the mean in traditional Chinese philosophy, nor do they understand the economics of a feudal and backward agricultural society. It is precisely this relationship that prevents us from catching up with the times in certain areas.

However, the distance between the world is shrinking day by day. You can't refuse to move, and you can't move slowly, because others will push you and step all over you.

Zhao Shangju
Yu Ranweng's elegy for Zhao Tieqiao, the former director of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company: "Sacrificed his life for his ambition, a loss for construction." This shows that Director Zhao of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was indeed worthy of remembrance at the time!

In the history of transportation in China, the change of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company into a state-owned enterprise is a valuable event in government policy. The death in office of former Director Zhao Tieqiao was the price paid to achieve this event.

The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is the foundation of China's shipping industry. Along with the Hanyang Iron and Steel Works, it is one of the only two large modern enterprises in the country. It was founded in November of the eleventh year of Tongzhi (thirty-ninth year before the Republic of China), when Li Hongzhang, as Governor-General of Zhili, requested its establishment. At that time, the motivation was to transport tribute grain and serve as transportation, and to resist the shipping industry of foreign merchants. In nature, it was a joint government-merchant enterprise, hence the name China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The government appointed five directors-general, and the merchant shareholders elected three directors to form an organization. Later, Li Hongzhang failed politically, and the company affairs were then presided over by the famous Sheng Xuanhuai. The old system gradually changed, and the status of merchant shares gradually increased. By the first year of Xuantong (three years before the Republic of China), the Ministry of Posts and Communications was added, and Sheng served as Minister (equivalent to the current Minister). The Ministry brought the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company under its jurisdiction and designated it as a joint-stock company. It also promulgated regulations for commercial offices under the Ministry. Adding the words "Commercial Office" to the name, becoming "Commercial Office China Merchants Steam Navigation Company," was actually far-fetched and cumbersome!

When Yuan Shikai declared himself emperor, he sent Yang to be the director. Later, when Xu Shichang and Cao Kun were in power, they also sent senior officials to Shanghai to investigate the economic accounts of the company, but they had not even entered the door before they left with money. When the National Revolutionary Army arrived in Wuhan, Yang Xingfo was appointed to preside over the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Yang did not take office for some reason. After the government established its capital in Nanjing, it appointed Zhang Renjie, Yang Xingfo, Yu Zhiqing, and others to form a committee to investigate and reorganize the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, with Zhang as the chairman (around May of the sixteenth year of the Republic). They compiled and printed an investigation and reorganization report in two volumes, which finally revealed the mystery of the problem.

Complex Personnel, Differing Factions

Before the Revolutionary Army captured Shanghai, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company had three major forces: Fu Xiaoan, Sheng Pingchen, and Li Guojie formed a three-legged situation. Soon, Fu was wanted and fled to Dalian, willingly accepting the protection of the enemy. Sheng's property was seized, and he also went into hiding. Li, as the overdue chairman, although able to maintain appearances, had become too powerful to control. Therefore, he thought of ingratiating himself with the government, while relying on the shareholders. The reason why the investigation could proceed smoothly was perhaps due to this.

After Zhao Tieqiao took office as director, he actively sought to take over the actual management. He established a general management office within the company and, on February 22 of the seventeenth year, in the name of the director and chairman, proceeded to reorganize. But Li Guojie suddenly became apprehensive and claimed to be sick and refused to come. That day, Zhao went to the company alone to take over management. From then on, one was bold and went forward bravely, and the other sought another way and quietly observed the changes. Most of the future storms were caused by this.

At that time, Zhao's environment was extremely difficult. Internal and external troubles arose one after another. If he was a person without perseverance, courage, and ability, he would not be able to stay in this situation for even a month, and he would not be able to sustain it. However, Zhao presided over it for three years. Counting the years, during these three years, Li was unable to cooperate, and there was the shareholder assistance association and shareholder maintenance association centered on Yu Qiaqing and Shi Shengzhi. Later, there was another group of Dong Kang, Jiang Zun, Wang Youling, and others holding Sheng's shares, sending telegrams and leaflets of attack like snowflakes. Moreover, Yu and Jiang had both been listed as members of the various investigation committees, which could further attract social attention. At first, there was a strike by the sailors, followed by the foreign banks such as HSBC and Citibank discussing the disposal of collateral. More unfortunately, the Xinhua, Xinji, and Xinkang ships caused trouble in the North and South Seas. However, he was able to calmly deal with them one by one, turning danger into safety.

Change to National Government, Director Dies in Office

Later, the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee resolved to transfer the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to the National Government and send a special commissioner to be responsible for reorganization. The powers of the special commissioner were exercised by Director Zhao Tieqiao, which further enhanced Zhao's position.

On the morning of July 24 of the nineteenth year, at about 8:00 am, when Zhao arrived at the company in his own car, he was suddenly shot by thugs who had been lying in wait. After being injured, he was sent to the Red Cross Hospital, but died of excessive blood loss. The perpetrators were a group of four from "Wang Yaqiao's" gang, which caused a sensation in society and was regarded as a key political case.

After the victory, the reorganization and restoration work of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was actively and intensely carried out. However, can we not feel regret for the past achievements of this director who lies asleep underground?!

Too Much Effort, translated by Chunliang from the Popular Digest

The police bureau wanted to catch someone, so they photographed him in six different styles and sent them to police bureaus everywhere. A few days later, the headquarters received a telegram from the director of a small city saying, "I just received the photos of the six villains you want to catch. Five of them have been caught.

A person who is particular about eating must have things that have all three qualities of color, taste, and aroma to be considered top-notch; otherwise, it seems that the excitement will be reduced. Taste is of course the essence of food, and tasteless things often reduce appetite; but no one uses their eyes and nose to eat, so what is the relationship between aroma and color?

Everything has a smell, especially food with the five flavors harmonized, the aroma is particularly rich. So when eating on weekdays, we also use our noses, but we just don't realize it. When the kitchen downstairs is cooking, the smell of scallions and oil upstairs often arouses appetite. This proves that aroma is also an important factor in food. When a person has a cold, although there is no fever and the body does not feel different, it is just that the nose is congested. But at this time, they often feel that their appetite is not good, which is partly because the sense of smell has lost its function and cannot help the tongue to appreciate a little more of the beauty of the food, thus hindering the appetite of the stomach.

Aroma is not necessarily conducive to appetite, and sometimes it can hinder appetite. For example, a strong and stimulating smell, if the person does not like it, no matter how good the taste of the thing is, they will refuse to eat it. People along the coast eat fish, and people inland find it too fishy. People in Shaoxing love to eat stinky tofu, and many people will cover their noses. Native people in Southeast Asia like to eat durian, and newcomers who first arrive overseas must vomit for three days. Chinese dishes often have a very strong aroma, but some people hold their noses when drinking it, the purpose is to reduce a little of this disharmonious smell.

Although the influence of color on food is not as important as aroma, it is not completely irrelevant. A bowl of red shrimp, with a few green peas, looks particularly bright. When a crystal green glass is filled with red wine, it will feel sweeter and more fragrant. Because beautiful colors attract appetite. Newly brewed tea definitely does not have the richness of a moment later, but the tender green color is more attractive than the straw yellow color. Color has already defeated taste, so the price of newly brewed tea is higher.

Once upon a time, a person invited many friends to dinner. The host's dishes were very rich, and the arrangement of the meal was not only luxurious, but the colors and lights were also well matched. When the guests were eating happily, suddenly the color in the room slowly changed, and the light was shrouded in a gray veil. Later, even the dishes in the bowls and plates changed color. The steak seemed to be bloody, and the fish were all dead white. Many guests who originally had a good appetite felt disgusted when they saw the food at this time. Finally, a few guests vomited what they had eaten before. Everyone looked at each other, confused, but did not know the host's prank. The taste of the dishes on the table did not change, but the color changed, which made the appetite of the people eating it greatly different. This is the relationship between color and food. All kinds of food have different colors, tastes, and aromas, but they are not very obvious, so people eating them do not easily notice them. The most obvious are fruits, most of which have bright colors and moving aromas, so fruits have become popular with everyone.

When the American Federation of Labor's financial industry employees went on strike and marched, they carried caged canaries, and the slogan meant: "We are not canaries, we want to buy clothes!"

Thieves' Threshold Bo Guang

The following two stealing tricks were told by an old navigator and sailor, and are very valuable, so they are recorded below:

Stealing sandalwood: Sandalwood for worshiping gods, like a very short piece of wood, some are more than two feet long, and some are more than three feet long. They are sold by the catty, and the price is quite expensive, and taxes must be levied, because it is a superstitious item. In order to prevent it from being intercepted during shipping, the store's stamp is added to the wooden core at both ends of the sandalwood. However, the thief, using a very clever method, wets his chest with sake, absorbs the seal from the end of the wood onto the flesh of his chest, and then shortens the sandalwood by a few inches or a foot. Afterwards, he still wets the end of the sandalwood with sake and absorbs the original seal on his chest onto the end of the wood. When you re-weigh and find that the weight is wrong, the shipper has to be responsible.

Stealing shoes: When shoes are being shipped, the thief only steals one shoe. If you reason with him, he says what's the point of stealing one shoe? You can't wear it? It must be the dispatcher who made a mistake. But the second time the same shoes are shipped, he exchanges the shoe he stole the first time for a pair! Although he became a thief, he made you not suspect that he was a thief. This is really wonderful.

Travel Newsletter On the "Meiqi" Ship Lu Shixiong

The "Meiqi" General, a transport ship converted into a civilian passenger ship, with a deadweight of 23,000 tons, left Shanghai on September 2 and has now arrived in San Francisco, USA. The ship carried a total of 2,200 passengers, including about 800 Chinese compatriots. General Feng Yuxiang and his wife and daughters were also on board. There were as many as 21 students from Shanghai University who took the ship to the United States. I have received a letter from classmate Gao Kefang, reporting the situation on the ship:

Many Chinese compatriots live in the temporary cabins at the bow or stern of the ship. Everything is very disciplined. Every day for three meals, everyone sits on the iron benches on the deck, and the waiters distribute aluminum lunch boxes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. After eating, they return the empty boxes. It is said that this method is the same as in the army, except that the passengers each lack a uniform.

For the sake of solidarity, Chinese students on the Meiqi held a Chinese fellowship meeting. After everyone left the embrace of their motherland, even strangers felt more cordial. In order to understand each person's past situation and plans for going to the United States, everyone had to give a "self-introduction." At the same time, General Feng Yuxiang and other Chinese professors on the ship were invited to give lectures to fill the spiritual food during the voyage. In addition, there was the added fun of dancing, fortunately, many of the Chinese professors and students on the ship were musicians, so they temporarily combined and performed a voluntary performance, which was both fun and inexpensive.

The students of Shanghai University on the Meiqi formed the Shanghai University Fellowship. Dr. Bao Zheqing, the former chairman of the school's board of directors, happened to be on board, so he took the lead and launched a donation campaign for the alma mater. On the spot, US$62 was donated on the ship, which was used to purchase books and magazines in the United States as a gift from the Shanghai University Fellowship on the Meiqi to the school.

Generally, when people leave their own country, they think of the loveliness of their motherland. At the same time, the alumni who graduated feel more cordial to their alma mater. Therefore, in the case of a non-full luggage on a long trip, they still offer some of their US dollar travel expenses to their alma mater. Although the amount is not large, it is truly a feather from a thousand miles away, a small gift but a great meaning! Principal Ling of the school was inspired by this enthusiastic news from overseas alumni.

Shanghai Insider Dancing Girls and Dance Halls 1 Jia Mo

Shanghai has had professional dancing girls for twenty years now. The emergence of dancing girls not only supplies the needs of dance halls in the city, but also supplies the demand from other cities and overseas. The number of dancing girls gradually increased from the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, and reached its peak during the August 13th Incident. In addition to the dozens of dance halls in the city, these charming women, like other Chinese and foreign department stores, had to be shipped out of Shanghai to major cities. Close ones such as Suzhou, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Qingdao, farther ones such as Pingjin, Dalian, Xiamen, Hong Kong and so on. Going abroad was to go to the Nanyang Islands such as Hanoi, Haiphong, Singapore, and so on. They are all young women who, whether in this city or opening up ports, have the serious burden of maintaining their personal lives and supporting their families. Whether they are beautiful or ugly, whether they are willing or unwilling to be dancing girls, they have to bite the bullet and do it, because the burden of life is pressing on their weak shoulders, and there is absolutely no room for them to consider it calmly.

Exploitation During the war, dance halls, like all industries, suffered unprecedented decline and blows. These poor dancing girls had no choice but to grit their teeth and endure the days. At the same time, they mostly could not go to other cities or return home. Victory brought them comfort and expectation, just like everyone else. But they could not help but feel disappointed. The biggest blow was that they could not practice their profession without registration, and after practicing their profession, among the meager dance tickets they received, they could only get one-third of the benefit. Another one-third belonged to the dance hall, and another one-third was the city government's entertainment tax.

What about women's professions? They are all a group of out-of-school girls who have no chance to receive education, and their average education level is less than the third grade of elementary school. But there are widowed mothers, weak younger brothers, etc. in the family. Even if there are fathers and brothers, they are also suffering from poverty and disease, and they are vagrants who cannot support their families. If they were to become female workers, there are simply not so many factories that can accommodate them. Moreover, the meager wages are not enough to support themselves.

Learning to Dance

They have no room for consideration, they have to be dancing girls. At the beginning of their youth - sixteen years old, they come out of the slums in teams. They all have "little sisters" to guide them to the way to dance. In fact, it's very simple. There are hundreds of thousands of dance training institutes in Shanghai (formerly known as dance schools). Little sisters generally don't need any tuition to enroll. As long as they patiently learn for ten days and a half months, they will be able to dance a few steps. Then, they are introduced to small dance halls by their little sisters, or they are introduced by the training institute. As long as they are beautiful, or "only of medium appearance," it is enough.

### News Figure Zeng Qi, Leader of the Youth Party, the "Mysterious Person" with Sparse Hair and a Long Beard Gan Lai

A short stature, sparse hair and a long beard, wearing a blue cloth long gown with many wrinkles, this is Zeng Qi, the leader of the Youth Party, currently known as the "mysterious person" - a 54-year-old man. People who have never met Zeng would probably mistake him for a country bumpkin and miss him even if they accidentally met him on the road.

People in Shanghai's education circles should not feel unfamiliar with the name Zeng Qi, because Zeng used to be a professor of Chinese at Shanghai Daxia University for many years, and also founded the "Awakening Lion Weekly," serving as editor-in-chief, instilling new ideas and theories. He is a knowledgeable scholar and thinker.

Mr. Zeng is from Sichuan, his courtesy name is Muhan. He studied in Japan in his early years and obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from Chuo University in Japan. Later, he went to Europe to study and obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in Sociology from a French university.

The Youth Party was secretly established on December 2, the twelfth year of the Republic of China. The current political views and positions of the party are neither left nor right, but in fact, the position of a political party must inevitably reveal some subjective opinions when dealing with complex and special political disputes. As the leader of the party, Zeng has received mixed praise and criticism. Although he feels both amused and annoyed, he still remains calm and continues to travel between various parties, calling for unity.

Mrs. Zeng is Ms. Zhou Ruo. Wherever Mr. Zeng goes, she will definitely follow, worthy of being called a good wife.

Zeng is good at poetry, and his poems often express his feelings about the times, deeply and painfully. He is proficient in three languages.

### Situ Meitang, Leader of the People's Livelihood Party Qiao Qiao

"Contact all parties and people who love peace and freedom, establish a democratic and unified government, and then engage in construction with economy. We are not the tail of any party, we are willing to take the will of the people as our action."

The above is the public statement issued to the press by Situ Meitang, the leader of the People's Livelihood Party, when he returned to China to form a party in September of this year. Mr. Situ is currently 81 years old, with white eyebrows and sideburns, but he is energetic. He is from Guangdong Province and lived in the United States in his early years. In the past, he worked hard with the Founding Father for the revolution. This time, at his old age, he came out to form a party out of the old spirit of working hard for the country, striving to promote domestic unity and relieve the suffering of his compatriots.

Mr. Situ was originally the leader of the Hongmen Zhigongtang. More than 3 million overseas Chinese have joined this organization. After changing to a new political party, it still receives the support of the majority of Hongmen brothers. We should have expectations and attach importance to this People's Livelihood Party that speaks for overseas Chinese.

Mr. Situ is old but healthy. It is said that he benefits from his appetite beyond ordinary people. He must eat three bowls of rice at every meal and likes to drink coffee. When walking, he walks as fast as flying, and many young people cannot keep up with him. His original wife is still alive and has three sons and two daughters, all of whom have grown up.

One regrettable thing: Mr. Situ's original home is Guangdong, and he has always resided in the Americas. He does not understand any language other than Cantonese and English, so he always has a translator with him when he travels to Beijing and Shanghai to translate for him.

Bless this old man who is enthusiastic about national affairs with health!
