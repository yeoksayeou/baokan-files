### Sino-American Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation Simultaneously Announced in Both Capitals; Foreign Minister Wang Appointed as Representative for Signing

[Central News Agency, Washington, 2nd] It is reported that the U.S. State Department and our Ministry of Foreign Affairs will simultaneously announce the full text of the Sino-American Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation at 3:00 AM Washington time on the 4th, which is 4:00 PM Nanjing time.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] The National Government issued an order on the 4th, specially appointing Wang Shijie and Wang Huacheng as plenipotentiary representatives for negotiating the Sino-American Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation.

[United Press, Washington, 3rd] The State Department announced on the 3rd that the United States and China have signed a Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation in Nanjing, with a term of five years. A State Department official solemnly declared to United Press reporters that the U.S. government's signing of this treaty at this time has absolutely no political significance. The signatories for the United States were Ambassador to China Stuart, and U.S. Special Commissioner and Consul General in Tianjin Smith. The treaty consists of 10,000 words, covering a wide range of topics. It will take effect upon ratification by the U.S. Senate and the Chinese Legislative Yuan. This treaty is based on the principle of mutual benefit and equality. The rights enjoyed by U.S. individuals and companies in China can also be enjoyed by Chinese individuals and companies in the United States. All rights are clearly and thoroughly stipulated in the treaty. This treaty replaces the existing nine treaties between the two countries, such as the initial Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Commerce signed on July 3, 1844.

Eliminating Traces of Extraterritoriality; Stipulating Principles of Mutual Business

U.S. officials stated that there are several reasons why the United States and China must sign this treaty, one of which is to eliminate the last traces of so-called extraterritoriality. The new treaty aims to stipulate the principles for mutual business operations between the two countries in a clear and legal manner. The rights obtained by U.S. companies in China have been slightly expanded as a result. However, due to the ongoing internal turmoil in China, most of the expanded rights obtained by U.S. businesses currently exist only on paper and cannot be implemented. The new treaty allows companies and associations of citizens of one country to "reside, travel, and conduct business" in various parts of the other country, and to engage in "commercial, manufacturing, scientific, educational, religious, and charitable activities" that are not prohibited by the laws of the other country. They may also "acquire, possess, construct, or lease suitable buildings" and lease land to carry out the above activities. Americans can form and join companies with Chinese people in China, and vice versa in the United States. The "most-favored-nation" principle appears frequently in the new treaty. The new treaty also stipulates that if one of the two countries grants any rights to individuals or companies of a third country to explore and develop mineral resources, the same rights must be granted to the other signatory country. According to the "freedom of commerce and navigation" clause, merchant ships of one country can navigate the territorial waters of the other country and dock at various ports, but warships and fishing boats are not included in this provision.

### Behind-the-Scenes Figure on Siam's Political Stage; Pridi Arrives in Nanjing for Visit; Departs China for England After Three-Day Stay

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] Former Prime Minister and Regent of Siam, Pridi Banomyong, accompanied by his wife and staff, and escorted by Sun Binggan, section chief of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, flew to Nanjing from Siam on the 3rd afternoon at 5:00 PM on a U.S. Pacific Overseas Airlines special plane. Li Jun, Director of Protocol of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Yang Yunzhu, Director of the Asian Department, Feng Zongyao representing Wu Tiecheng, and Feng Erhe, a Siamese community leader, all went to welcome them. After Pridi got off the plane, he shook hands with the welcoming personnel one by one, and then took a special car prepared by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the official residence of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to rest. According to Pridi, he is visiting China, England, and the United States in a private capacity. Your country's victory in the war of resistance has raised its international status, and it is honored as one of the five great powers. He is here for a visit in order to see the new China after the war. He plans to stay in Nanjing for three days, visit various leaders, and then leave China for England. Others accompanying him include Luan Sukun, Director of the Siamese Propaganda Department. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is preparing a grand welcome for Pridi's visit to China, which will enhance friendly relations between the two countries.

[Another Telegram] Pridi Banomyong, a Siamese elder statesman who arrived in Nanjing for a visit on the 3rd, is the powerful leader of Siam and the behind-the-scenes manipulator on Siam's political stage. He was formerly known as Luan Balik. "Luan" in Siam means "Viscount." Luan Balik automatically canceled his title and restored his original name, Pridi Banomyong, after the June 1932 coup. He is originally from Chaozhou, Guangdong, with the surname Chen. Few people know his Chinese name. He does not use a Chinese name and does not acknowledge being Chinese because he was born in Siam. According to Siamese law, any foreigner born in Siam is considered Siamese. Pridi has never been to China. He studied law in France. He is talented and capable. After returning to Siam from France, he joined the government and held a considerable position. He was the mastermind of the June coup, and the coup plan was completed under his guidance. After the coup, he became a powerful leader in Thailand. The following year, Pridi drafted a "New Economic Policy" advocating that the government buy land and then distribute it to the people for cultivation, turning farmers into government employees. The People's Assembly believed that this policy had communist overtones, and he was considered leftist. At that time, Siamese law outlawed communism. Pridi could not stand his ground and had to flee abroad. Later, the Siamese government organized a review committee to examine whether he was truly a communist. The result was that he was not considered leftist, so his "crime" of being a communist was revoked, and he returned to the Siamese political stage, serving as Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Finance. When the European War broke out in 1939, he saw the British power gradually declining and the Japanese power expanding in Asia. Therefore, he frequently courted Japan, trying to win their favor. At that time, overseas Chinese in Siam, motivated by patriotism, rose up to boycott Japanese goods and donate money to save the country. Under Pridi's behind-the-scenes guidance, the Luan Phibuns government used high-handed means to prevent the patriotic actions of overseas Chinese. Antih Kwang-eng, chairman of the Bangkok Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, died tragically for leading donations and other patriotic actions. Based on this policy, Siam also concluded a treaty of alliance with Japan. As a result, when the Pacific War broke out, Siam invaded Burma and Malaya through Japan, and declared war on Britain and the United States. In the late stages of the war, Pridi saw that the situation was not good. On the one hand, he superficially perfunctorily dealt with Japan, and on the other hand, he communicated with the Allied countries. Domestically, he led an underground organization called "Free Thai," secretly resisting Japan. Abroad, he sent "Free Thai" personnel to be stationed in England, the United States, and China. When the victory was achieved last year, Pridi was the regent. In order to wash away its guilt of colluding with Japan, the Siamese government immediately issued a declaration declaring that the declaration of war against Britain and the United States was "illegal" and invalid." It sent a delegation to Kandy, the headquarters of the Allied Forces in Southeast Asia, to negotiate a "treaty to eliminate the state of war." As a result, the Anglo-Siamese Treaty was signed. Because of the generous support of the United States, Siam, in addition to compensating Britain for all the losses suffered by British interests in Siam during the war and allowing the Allied countries to control its main products—rice, teak, tin, and rubber—was not subjected to very severe sanctions. When the late King returned to the country from Switzerland last December, Pridi resigned as regent. The People's Assembly then resolved to give him the title of "Elder." He reached such a lofty position, but he is only about forty-seven years old. Pridi manipulated Siamese politics behind the scenes, and in the spring of this year, he encountered his first resistance. A coup member known for his candor, directness, honesty, and democracy, Khuang Aphaiwong, united with some other coup members and stood up to oppose Pridi, saying he was "undemocratic" and attacking him as a "dictator." As a result, in March, Pridi came out from behind the scenes and took responsibility for governing head-on, taking the post of Prime Minister. Khuang and his comrades organized the "Democratic Party" and took an opposition stance in the People's Assembly. At the beginning of May this year, the new Siamese Constitution was promulgated, and the People's Assembly was changed from a unicameral system to a bicameral system. In the election of Upper House officials, the Pridi faction won an overwhelming victory, and almost all of the Upper House members were coup members he led. In June, King Ananda Mahidol suddenly collapsed and died, and people believed he was assassinated, blaming the government. Pridi was still the Prime Minister, and became a general target of attack. The Democratic Party took the opportunity to act, taking anti-Pridi action. Pridi used high-handed means to deal with it. He first declared a nationwide "emergency period," then implemented press censorship, controlled public opinion, and arrested anti-government" journalists, even People's Representatives and those suspected of being pro-government were also arrested, and the turbulent situation gradually calmed down. Although Pridi's ancestors were Chinese, he has no knowledge of the motherland and no goodwill towards overseas Chinese in Siam. Last September, Siamese military police massacred overseas Chinese in Bangkok. Several community leaders protested to Pridi, but not only did he not say that the actions of the Siamese military police were illegal, but he instead said that the overseas Chinese were wrong. His visit to China is a good opportunity for him to know how much goodwill we have towards Siam, and how magnanimous and tolerant the Chinese are. We have absolutely no territorial or other ambitions towards Thailand.

### Yoshiko Kawashima's Case of Colluding with the Enemy: Hebei High Court Prosecutor Files Indictment; Full Text of Indictment Recounts Her Crimes

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 3rd] The famous female spy Jin Bihui (i.e., Yoshiko Kawashima) has been investigated by Cheng Sansheng, prosecutor of the Hebei High Court, who has concluded that the charges against her of colluding with the enemy and resisting her own country are significant. He has charged her on the 31st of last month in the criminal court of that court with violating Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. The full text of the indictment is excerpted below:

Defendant Jin Bihui is the daughter of Prince Su of the abdicated Qing Dynasty. She was born in Japan and orphaned at the age of three. She was adopted by the Japanese Kawashima Naniwa, hence the name Yoshiko Kawashima. At the age of nine, she was re-recognized by the Japanese Tada Naru as her adoptive father, but was still raised by Kawashima. She studied at the Tokyo Women's Academy. In addition to her studies, she learned everything about politics, military affairs, languages, painting, horseback riding, shooting. She was proficient in swimming, running, skating, dancing, and driving cars and airplanes. Her ambition was to use the power of Japan to restore the imperial cause of the Aisin Gioro clan, because Prince Su had advocated Sino-Japanese friendship during his lifetime, recommending Kawashima Naniwa as a Qing court consultant. Kawashima was extremely pro-China and received preferential treatment from the Qing court. After the abdication of the Qing court, he sympathized with Prince Su. The defendant inherited her father's legacy and listened to Kawashima's teachings, regarding the National Revolution of our country as an enemy and constantly plotting resistance. In 1932, the defendant first returned to Shanghai and became very close to the Japanese Consulate and military attaché Tanaka. Later, when she went to Changchun, she carried many letters for Commander Tada. At that time, her brother Jin Bidong was the mayor of the puppet Manchukuo's Xinjing and concurrently the garrison commander, and later became the commander of the Dian'an guerrillas. He discussed with the defendant and Tada the affairs of building an army in Manchuria. The defendant participated in the incorporation of Chen Guorui's troops into the Dingguo Army and the resolution of Su Bingwen's troops guarding the railway. Later, she discussed with her nephew Yu Jing the plan to move the Manchu Emperor to the Rehe detached palace and then back to Beiping to restore the imperial cause. Because the Japanese army did not agree, she went to Tianjin and invested 30,000 yuan to open the Dongxinglou Restaurant as a place to contact the Japanese. Later, Tada was transferred to Tianjin as the head of the special service agency, and he contacted the defendant at the Dongxinglou to discuss Chinese issues, advocating the use of Wang Jingwei, and dispatched Gu Qian to contact him, proposing "South China to remain untouched, Central China to Wang, and North China to Zhu Chen." Later, when the Dongxinglou went bankrupt, the report again stated that when she came to Beiping, Usami was the president of the North China Transportation Company, and Ba Jiaxiang was the president of the Wude Newspaper, specializing in intelligence work with Li Xianglan, Nakagawa Shigeko, and others. At that time, the defendant interacted with them. Many people who attached themselves to the enemy for personal gain, such as Luo Qingshan, Zhu Fuchang, Yuan Guan, Jiang Yapeng, and others, all flocked to her and conspired to provide resources to the enemy, benefit the enemy, harm the country and the people. In 1935, the defendant returned to Japan once and broadcasted Sino-Japanese friendship on radio stations in Tokyo and Osaka. In 1941, she returned to Fukuoka, Japan. When Matsuoka Yosuke returned from Germany, the defendant personally welcomed him at the airport. Later, she went to Tokyo. When Wang Jingwei was in Japan, he studied Sino-Japanese issues with Toyama Mitsuru, advocating that cooperation with the central government was the only way to succeed. She also published an article titled "Chinese Affairs" in the Women's Public Opinion. She also launched a celebration and welcomed the puppet emperor with lanterns when he visited Japan for the second time. When the defendant returned to China from Japan, she used an exit permit issued by Prime Minister Konoe and forwarded by Prime Minister Tojo, and suggested to Tojo's wife to quickly seek peace. During her twelve years in this country, the defendant served as the president of the Beijing Manchurian Association, the chairman of the China Gold Mining Company, and the commander-in-chief of the North China People's Self-Defense Army, among other puppet positions. She has admitted this without hesitation, and there are photos, pictorials, and Xiaofang Hachiro's confession as evidence. The content of her actions was nothing more than contacting enemy and puppet personnel, using Japanese military force to achieve her dream of restoring the Manchu Qing Dynasty. Her crime of colluding with the enemy and plotting to resist her own country is significant and should constitute a violation of Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors.

### Building Temples and Erecting Pagodas to Endure for Eternity; Comforting Orphans and Aiding the Young to Console Loyal Souls: Ministry of National Defense Requests Internal Affairs Ministry to Handle Three Matters

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] During the War of Resistance, many of our loyal and brave officers and soldiers sacrificed themselves for the country. In order to reward their merits, the government, through the former Military Affairs Commission, had previously consulted with the Ministry of Interior to build martyrs' shrines, memorial arches and pagodas, and hold national funerals, public funerals, and public cemeteries. In order to facilitate the application for pensions by the bereaved families, condolence inquiry offices were established in various townships, towns, and district offices, and teachers and staff of various schools were appointed as agents to handle the pension procedures on behalf of the bereaved families. The Ministry of National Defense believes that all of the above items need to be actively carried out and has sent a telegram to the Ministry of Interior requesting them to handle the following matters: (1) Regarding the establishment of condolence inquiry offices in various township and district offices, many provinces and counties have not yet reported their establishment, and none have been established in the recovered areas. Please reiterate the previous order and set a deadline for reporting their establishment within this year; (2) The funding for the construction of martyrs' shrines and memorial arches and pagodas is to be planned and handled by local governments at all levels. However, it has been found that many have not been built. Now that more than a year has passed since the victory of the War of Resistance, active efforts should be made to show respect for the loyal and righteous and to maintain the righteous spirit of the nation; (3) Regarding the implementation of national funerals, public funerals, and public cemeteries, the Central Standing Committee and the Supreme National Defense Council have previously resolved to postpone them during the rehabilitation period. Now that the capital has been restored for nearly half a year, it seems that planning and implementation should be considered.

### Trade in Northern Vietnamese Ports: French Announce Restriction Regulations; Imports and Exports Must Be Approved for Exchange

[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 2nd] Concurrently with the implementation of the new Franco-Vietnamese Treaty, the French and Vietnamese authorities announced a regulation stipulating that from November 1st, all goods entering and leaving Northern Vietnamese ports must first be approved for exchange by the French authorities before being allowed to enter or leave. The main points of the regulation are as follows: Imports: Goods shipped from France to Vietnam can be traded freely. Goods shipped from other countries to Vietnam must first be approved and the Vietnamese currency value of the goods must be exchanged at the Foreign Exchange Control Office. It is specifically stipulated that liquid fuels and lubricants are strictly prohibited from being imported. Exports: All goods approved for export must apply for an export permit. Rice, rubber, raw rubber, textiles, refined metals, precious metals, automobiles, automobile materials, machinery and equipment, etc., are strictly prohibited from being exported. All goods approved for export must be exchanged. Foreign exchange must be paid to the French government at the official rate. The principle of Vietnamese import and export trade is balance. Exporters have priority in applying for import transit. Goods transshipped through Northern Vietnamese ports to China should apply for transit at the port management office and can only be transshipped after approval. Domestic Trade in Vietnam: Imported goods are all controlled by the Economic Affairs Bureau's Control Bureau. After approval, they are either directly allocated to users by the government or freely sold by merchants, with separate regulations to be determined. The French authorities also stipulate that Chinese merchants should form chambers of commerce or join French chambers of commerce and can only operate after establishing contact with the French authorities. In order to facilitate the exchange of import and export goods, the French Foreign Exchange Control Office has specifically stipulated that one Vietnamese dollar is equivalent to 500 national dollars, 7 Vietnamese dollars are equivalent to one US dollar, and 1 Vietnamese dollar and 7 jiao 3 fen are equivalent to one Hong Kong dollar. The official exchange rate of the Vietnamese dollar this time, 7 jiao 3 fen is equivalent to one Hong Kong dollar. However, the official exchange rate of the Vietnamese dollar differs greatly from the actual transaction figures in the market. Many of our overseas Chinese merchants have expressed opposition to the measures announced by the French authorities, and whether they can be implemented will depend on the facts.

### Best Destination for Floating Capital: Northeast Is the Best Base for Revitalizing Industry and Commerce; Representatives from Northeast Chamber of Commerce Hope for Domestic and Foreign Investment

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce took a day off on the 3rd. Representatives from various places visited industrial and commercial sites and went on suburban excursions. Representatives from the Northeast visited elementary schools and factories, expressing surprise at the scarcity of capital bacon and the abundance of foreign goods in the capital. They were also amazed by the high prices and extravagant lifestyle. They were all concerned about the disaster and, after talking about the news of the famine in some areas, they sighed and said that the Northeast produces more grain, but it cannot be imported into the customs due to transportation issues. The floating capital in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places is rampant, disrupting the market. Wouldn't it be better to use it to revitalize the Northeast? Most of the representatives from the Northeast stayed in a small hotel in the south of the city, discussing national affairs. Their desire for governance was greater than anyone else's. They repeatedly urged the reporter to tell the people of the country that the industrial and commercial foundation of the Northeast is extremely good, and the wealth it contains is the best base for revitalization.

He held important party and government positions throughout his career. In recent years, as a member of the Legislative Yuan, he made significant contributions. During the War of Resistance, he gave speeches to resist the enemy and inspire the people. His patriotism grew stronger with age. It is deeply regretted that he has passed away.

### Meeting with Mrs. Cripps: She Says She Is Very Interested in the Yellow River Damming Project; Hopes "China's Sorrow" Will Turn Into "China's Joy"

[Our Zhengzhou Dispatch, 2nd] Mrs. Cripps flew to Zhengzhou from Yan'an on the 1st. Counting from Hong Kong, she has traveled 17,000 li on the Chinese mainland. She came to Zhengzhou specifically to see the famous Yellow River and stayed in Zhengzhou for two days, braving the sandstorms, visiting Huayuankou and Zhongmou port. She told reporters that she was very interested in the Yellow River damming project and hoped that the Yellow River, known as "China's Sorrow," would one day become "China's Joy." At Huayuankou, she crossed the Yellow River to the north bank in a Chinese wooden boat. Her companion, Miss Klose, tripped while boarding the boat and slid from the high bank to the river beach, tearing her stockings and scraping her skin. The ancient Yellow River sparkled with silver scales in the sunlight, flowing eastward, silently. Mrs. Cripps was also silent. When she flew from Taiyuan to Yan'an, the Chinese who accompanied her on the trip stopped in Taiyuan and other places. During the trip to Zhengzhou, she stopped at Xinxiang Airport for half an hour, which was the largest airport built by the Japanese army on the banks of the Yellow River.

She is 64 years old, and many people praise her good spirits. It is said that Madame Chiang is very concerned about her and wants her to not have to deal with complicated receptions during her long journey. At 7:30 PM last night, Chairman Liu Maoen sent an invitation to a banquet for her. Li Hongyin, director of the Henan Provincial Department of Social Affairs, hosted the banquet on behalf of Liu Maoen. Everyone ate silently for an hour.

She officially met with reporters at 8:30 AM today. First, she and Mrs. Miller, secretary of the British United Aid to China Fund, gave reporters an overview of the fund's past work, and then let reporters ask questions. Before the reporter's second question was asked, she said that because time was short, she hoped that reporters would ask no more than two questions, for a five-minute conversation. She was serious and dignified, fully demonstrating the British character. She told reporters that she was traveling and learning in China, absorbing impressions, and contacting both the "left" and the "right," because the fund's past work was also like this, not taking a political stance. She was very interested in the agriculture in Yan'an, but in any case, she could not clearly express her views at the moment, because it was most dangerous for foreigners to come to China for only a few days and then express their opinions. Regarding the establishment of a hospital in Yan'an, she expressed gratitude for the understanding of all parties, but as for whether the hospital was well-run, it was impossible to compare it with other places, because the equipment and other conditions could not be measured by the same standard. She continued to tell reporters that one thing she could say was that the Chinese people were currently in a very tragic situation, and she hoped that all parties would have patience and that peace was possible. After saying the opinions of not expressing opinions, she said goodbye to the reporters and prepared to drive to the Zhongmou ferry to see the Yellow River again. The reporter chased after her, wanting to ask a question directly related to Sino-British friendship, but she had already run into her room. Turning around, I saw her daughter, Miss Peggy, sitting in a chair, recording her mother's conversations, performing the duties of a private secretary. She worked diligently all the way, writing a diary for her mother. During the flight, she put the typewriter on her lap, taking advantage of the time to work hard.

Editorial

### The Unignorable Korean Problem

The Korean Southern Democratic Association yesterday appealed to the United Nations General Assembly, putting forward three demands: (1) Immediately implement the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Declaration to ensure Korea's freedom and independence; (2) The US and Soviet troops should withdraw from Korea immediately; (3) Allow the Korean Provisional Government to join the UN agencies as a member state, to negotiate directly with the Soviet Union to discuss the issue of abolishing the demarcation line between the US and Soviet occupation zones and the withdrawal of Soviet troops.

Korea, in the past, was China's protective screen, now it is China's neighbor, and in the future, it will surely be China's like-minded ally. Therefore, China has always expressed sympathy for Korea's past misfortunes, and is especially concerned about Korea's future destiny. Korea, in its letter to the United Nations General Assembly, stated: "Dividing Korea into two occupation zones is a direct threat to world peace." We not only sympathize with this warning, but also hope that the US and Soviet occupation authorities can put aside their prejudices and have a broad vision, so that they can recognize the correctness of the Korean people's demands.

Korea is the largest peninsula in Asia, protruding into the Sea of Japan and the Yellow Sea, and is located in the middle of China, Japan, and the Soviet Union, forming its important strategic position. In the past forty years, Japanese imperialists have been using Korea as a springboard into the Asian continent and have attempted to use it as a base to attack the Soviet Union. However, after this great war, the aggressors, who continued to wage wars of exhaustion, finally surrendered, and Korea, which had been subjugated for a long time, was freed from the shackles of Japanese warlord rule. Korea has since been liberated, leaping from a colony to an independent and free democratic country, which should not have been a problem at all. However, due to the twists and turns of fate, after the collapse of Japan's dictatorial rule, what followed was the division of Korea by the United States and the Soviet Union. By artificial means, the entire indivisible Korean nation was forcibly divided into North and South, and was ruled by the occupation authorities of the United States and the Soviet Union, resulting in two worlds within one country, which has not yet achieved unification and independence!

Recalling that during the war, the Korean people, under the rule of Japanese warlords, although living in darkness and suffering the bitterness of national subjugation, still felt that the future of Korea would be infinitely bright when they heard the leaders of the United Nations repeatedly issue "war aims" such as the national freedom advocated by the Atlantic Charter. Once Japan was defeated, Korea could be liberated immediately. For example, in August 1941, when the two giants, Roosevelt and Churchill, met somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean, they issued a declaration stating: "The United States and Britain respect the right of all peoples to choose the political form on which their survival depends; in all nations, if this right is deprived, the two countries want to restore their original sovereignty and autonomy." Furthermore, in December 1943, the three giants, Roosevelt, Churchill, and Chiang Kai-shek, issued a declaration after meeting in Cairo, stating: "The purpose of the operations of the three great powers, China, Britain, and the United States, is to deprive Japan of all the islands it has seized or occupied in the Pacific since the beginning of the First World War in 1914, and to deprive Japan of the territories it has stolen from China, such as Manchuria, Taiwan, and the Penghu Islands, which should be returned to China. In addition, Japan will also be expelled from the land it has seized by force or greed. The three great powers, China, Britain, and the United States, in view of the slave treatment suffered by the Korean people, have decided that Korea should be granted freedom and independence in due course." These magnificent international documents gave infinite warmth to the general Korean people living in misery. In their eyes, a bright light of hope was shining. By the time Nazi Germany surrendered unconditionally, victory was in sight, and the Korean people became even more optimistic, especially with the Potsdam Declaration issued by the leaders of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, which gave the Korean people greater excitement and impetus. Because the Soviet Union had never expressed its attitude towards Korea clearly before, but in this Potsdam Declaration, it was also solemnly stated: "The terms of the Cairo Declaration shall be implemented." Since the Soviet Union had signed the Potsdam Declaration, it naturally participated in the international guarantee provided for the independence of Korea. In the eyes of the Korean people, how sacred and worthy of celebration the Potsdam Declaration was!

However, after Japan surrendered, when the Korean people were eager to see international promises come to fruition, a sudden twist occurred. Because after the end of the war, the Allied countries, who had fought shoulder to shoulder in the past, seemed to be in a state of mutual suspicion due to conflicts of interest. Setting aside the German and Austrian issues for the time being, in the Far East, the United States and the Soviet Union not only seemed to have differences of opinion on the China issue, but also friction occurred in Korea, causing the sky in the Far East to remain cloudy, with a sense of impending storm. Later, fortunately, US Secretary of State Byrnes took the lead in advocating a compromise with the Soviet Union and personally went to Moscow to hold a meeting of the three foreign ministers with Foreign Minister Molotov and British Foreign Secretary Bevin. In addition to reaching an agreement on the German issue, a compromise was also reached on the Korean issue: (1) Establish a Korean Provisional Government to develop its agriculture, industry, and national culture; (2) The US occupation authorities in southern Korea and the Soviet occupation authorities in northern Korea should form a joint committee; (3) Korea should be placed under the trusteeship of the four powers, China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, for a period of five years, after which it would be granted independence; (4) The US and Soviet occupation authorities should cooperate effectively and should immediately hold a meeting to discuss various urgent issues and reach solutions.

When the Korean people heard the declaration of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers' Conference, it was like a bolt from the blue, completely unexpected. Therefore, after being disappointed, the patriotic people launched a mass movement in the country to oppose the five-year trusteeship plan, which was tragic, enthusiastic, and in full swing, and has not stopped to this day. On the US and Soviet sides, although they also know the wishes of the Korean people and their pain under the US-Soviet division, the opinions of the two sides are completely different, and it is really impossible to reach an agreement. Although the US and Soviet occupation authorities have repeatedly held negotiations to discuss the political and economic merger of the two occupation zones, so that there would no longer be two worlds in Korea, the negotiations reached the brink of collapse on May 6 this year and could not continue. No negotiations have resumed since then.

The wishes of the Korean people are very clear and simple: in a word, they oppose the five-year trusteeship plan and demand the immediate establishment of a provisional government to realize the Korean people's desire for self-governance. The Soviet Union, on the other hand, insists on the resolution of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers' Conference, placing Korea under the trusteeship of the four powers for five years before granting it independence; at the same time, it has erected a thick iron curtain in the Soviet occupation zone of northern Korea, not allowing outsiders to know the actual situation in northern Korea, and not allowing any interaction between the US and Soviet occupation zones. The Soviet Union's actions have virtually turned Korea into two worlds, and the Korean people feel even more the pain of the country being dismembered, and they are more urgently demanding national independence and freedom. As for the US occupation zone, General Hodge's control is indeed very clever and can win the support of the Korean people. However, his sole goal in controlling southern Korea is to prevent the southward invasion of Soviet forces into southern Korea, so there has been no way to reach a compromise with the Soviet Union to "restore Korea to unity."

In short, today's Korea has become a stage for the struggle of the United States and the Soviet Union. From the perspective of the Korean people, they not only feel increasingly hopeless about the prospect of independence, but also feel that their own position is extremely dangerous. If the policies adopted by the United States and the Soviet Union in Korea are not revised, the mutual suspicion between the two sides will inevitably intensify, and an unforeseen disaster may even come one day. Therefore, the Korean Southern Democratic Association said: "Dividing Korea into two occupation zones is a direct threat to world peace." We completely sympathize with this, and we hope that the United Nations General Assembly by Lake Success will not turn a deaf ear to the voices of the Korean people. At the same time, the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference is being held in New York today, and this issue should also be discussed, because how Korea is arranged should really not be ignored.

### The Second Phase of the Jiangnan Seawall Construction: Shen Baixian and Others Inspect the First Phase of the Project

[Zhenjiang News] The Jiangnan Seawall in Jiangsu Province starts from the Jin Si Niang Bridge on the border of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, passes through Jinshan, Songjiang, Fengxian, Nanhui, Chuansha, Baoshan, Taicang, Changshu, and ends at Jiangyin, with a total length of more than 300 kilometers. It is located in the estuary of the river and the sea, where the tides are surging, so seawalls are built to defend against them. Over the past eight years, the seawall has collapsed, especially in the four counties of Taicang, Songjiang, Changshu and Baoshan, where the situation is particularly dangerous. The piles and stones have been completely destroyed, and more than 4,000 meters of the seawall have collapsed, and dozens of large and small soil seawalls have collapsed. The Jiangsu-Ningbo Branch of the Executive Yuan, the Water Conservancy Committee, and the Jiangsu Provincial Government jointly repaired the seawall to protect the coastal farmland and the lives and property of the people, using work as compensation. According to reporters, since the start of construction in March this year to the end of September, the first phase of the project has been completed. The actual work of piles and stones in the four counties of Changshu, Taicang, Baoshan and Songjiang is 45,826 man-days, 1,605 tons of flour and 800 tons of rice were distributed, 7,500 cubic meters of earthwork and 11,175 cubic meters of stonework were completed. In addition, the soil seawall project in the nine counties of Chengjiang, Changshu, Taicang, Baoshan, Nanchuan, Fengxian, Songjiang, and Jinshan actually did 106,839 man-days, and 800 tons of flour and 150 tons of rice were distributed. 124,806.53 cubic meters of earthwork and 11,180.34 cubic meters of stone were thrown.

New recruits from Jiangyin and Yixing counties have also been sent to the center in recent days, and the situation is very enthusiastic. This time, the center is particularly strict with physical examinations for new recruits, preferring to have too few rather than too many, in order to establish a modern national defense army.

[Our Newspaper Jiangyin News] This county was ordered to conscript 580 new recruits. County Magistrate Fang actively ordered each district and town to draw lots to determine the recruits. A total of 293 people passed the inspection. The Wuxi Military Region has sent personnel to Chengjiang to check and accept them. At 12:00 noon today (the 2nd), they were gathered in the city stadium and reorganized into two companies. All sectors held a consolation meeting, and each new recruit was given consolation goods worth 5,000 yuan. A variety show was held in the county government auditorium. At 2:00 PM, they took cars to Wuxi to enter the camp. After the first batch of new recruits went to Wuxi, various agencies will organize an investigation team to go to various townships to investigate whether there are any corrupt practices. If any occur, they will be reported to the military region for handling. As for the 168 unqualified young men, the military section has strictly ordered each township to transfer qualified young men to supplement the number, so as to meet the public orders in a short period of time.

[Our Newspaper Suzhou Electric, 3rd] Liu Hongde, Deputy Commander of the Taihu Suppression Zone, met with our reporter on the 3rd and explained that although the Taihu Suppression Zone is wide and the ports and estuaries are numerous, making it difficult to achieve the effect of complete suppression, all the famous bandits are expected to surrender soon.

### Prices Rise, Rice Prices Fall: Labor-Management Disputes in Suzhou

[Our Newspaper Suzhou News] The workers in various industries in this county once had labor-management disputes because the price of rice rose endlessly and wages could not keep up. After mediation by the relevant authorities, it was finally agreed to pay wages based on rice, and both labor and management were able to see mutual benefits. However, in recent months, the price of rice has fallen and the price of goods has risen, and the wages of the workers have suddenly been shortened, and it has become difficult to meet their living needs, so they have once again proposed to increase wages. The summary is as follows: (1) The wages of shoe-making workers are calculated per pair. Making a pair of shoes can earn 1.9 to 3.5 liters of rice. Labor feels that the price of rice has fallen and other commodity prices have risen. It is requested that the employer increase wages based on the proportion of shoe-making workers, but the employer agrees. Therefore, a general strike was launched on the 1st, and the county's social department is currently mediating. (2) Construction workers feel that the value of each worker's wages in Shanghai is more than 10,000 yuan, and Wuxi also has 6,400 yuan, while this county only has more than 3,000 yuan, so they have proposed a price increase request to the employer. The employer said that when the price was adjusted last time, it was agreed that it could only be changed after six months, but only one month has passed, and it is difficult to break the contract. Therefore, the two sides are deadlocked and have not been resolved so far. (3) The tofu workers recently asked the employer to calculate their wages based on 60,000 yuan per stone of rice to maintain their livelihood. The employer said that it has been agreed that since the price of rice has fallen, it cannot be converted according to this standard. The two sides are currently waiting for mediation.

[Our Newspaper Wenling News] The new rice crop in the four townships of this county has already been harvested.

[Our Newspaper Wuxi News] Mao Sen, Chief of Staff of the Wuxi Command Post of the Capital Garrison Headquarters, believes that Chairman Chiang's visit to Wuxi for his 60th birthday is an unparalleled honor for Wuxi, and should be commemorated in a meaningful way.

### The Winter Cultivation of Some Farmland in Northern Jiangsu Has Been Delayed: The Spring Famine Next Year Is Worrying, Relying Only on Stored Grain: Observations Released by Inspection Teams from Central Agencies

[Our Newspaper Suzhou Electric, 3rd] A group of 12 people from the inspection team of central agencies set off from Nanjing on October 2 and traveled to more than 30 counties north and south of the Yangtze River, arriving in Suzhou yesterday. Our reporter went to visit after hearing the news. When asked about the impressions of this trip, they told us that the inspection task was centered on the newly recovered areas in northern Jiangsu. The general impression was that it was unbearable to see. The entire rural area of northern Jiangsu was either a natural disaster or a man-made disaster. Most farmers are now eating sweet potato porridge every day. Although it is time to plant wheat, some farmland is barren and no one is cultivating it. There are two reasons for this: (1) The coastal counties cannot be cultivated due to flooding; (2) When the communists controlled the area, they distributed land rights in a disorganized manner. After the recovery, some landowners did not dare to continue cultivating, while most of the original owners fled and did not return. Therefore, at present, they are only relying on a small amount of stored grain to maintain themselves. It is expected that the spring famine next year will be severe and needs to be saved urgently. It is learned that the team has come to Suzhou to sort out the report and does not plan to set out for inspection again. They will return to Nanjing in the next few days.

### Jin-Ou Railway

Jinhua Chamber of Commerce Suggests Construction

[Our Newspaper Jinhua News] The Jinhua Chamber of Commerce believes that the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and other lines are being actively repaired, and it is expected that the transportation in the southeast and southwest will be smooth soon. At the time when Taiwan returns to the motherland's territory, in order to consolidate national defense, it is urgent to build the Jin-Ou Railway to connect with the mainland and achieve the effect of control. Moreover, the sugar production in Taiwan is very abundant, and the seafood in Yongjia is also abundant, and it is particularly necessary to open up more transportation routes to facilitate domestic sales. The leakage of imports in Shejin, the alum in Pingyang, and the fluorine stone in Wuyi are all related to increasing agricultural production and manufacturing military supplies. If this road is completed, its benefits to both national defense and economy will be far-reaching. It is heard that Cheng and others have drafted a proposal and submitted it to the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce for discussion.

### Bengbu's Commercial Recession: 50 Businesses Closed Down in the Past Two Months

[Our Newspaper Bengbu News] In the past two months, under the shadow of the commercial recession, the market in this area has become increasingly depressed. Lively streets have been holding closing sales, and the words "Liquidation at 60% off" reflect the shopkeepers' anxiety to sell off their goods. Those who have closed down are following one after another, and the empty houses after the announcement of closure are also unattended.

### Difficult for Impoverished Counties in Zhejiang Province to Obtain Assistance from Wealthy Neighbors

Provincial Government's Redistribution Plan Difficult to Implement

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 3rd] The salaries of public school teachers in various counties of Zhejiang are meager, many still below 30,000, making it impossible to make ends meet. It is often heard of teachers sending their children off to work at a young age. The provincial government intends to redistribute funds from wealthier counties to poorer ones, but this requires the approval of the Provincial Assembly. However, the resident assembly members still have differing opinions on this matter. The Hangzhou city assembly members have already submitted a request to the provincial government to be exempted from assisting other counties due to their own financial difficulties, and it is feared that the Ningbo, Shaoxing, Jiaxing, and Huzhou regions will also be unable to provide assistance.

### Rickshaw Puller Assemblyman Assaulted and Humiliated by Police Officer; Bureau Chief Apologizes and Files Legal Complaint

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch] Zhao Yanxiu, a rickshaw puller assemblyman in Hangzhou, was pulling an empty rickshaw around 6 a.m. on the 1st when he passed through Guanxiangkou to Sanyuanfang. There, traffic officer Fu Xiulan, claiming to be acting on police orders, stopped him, saying that empty rickshaws were not allowed to pass through. Fu then confiscated the rickshaw seat cushion. Zhao questioned Fu's actions and asked to see the police order, leading to a conflict. Fu took Zhao to the Zhongzheng Street police station. The patrol officer Zhang Guowei was away, so police officers Gong Jian and three others detained him for obstructing traffic, citing violation of police regulations. Zhao then produced a name card bearing the titles "Hangzhou City Assemblyman, Zhejiang Branch Member of the Chinese Labor Association, Executive Director of the Hangzhou General Labor Union, Standing Director of the Hangzhou Rickshaw Pullers Union" and questioned the police officers for the reason. The police officers, thinking he was impersonating someone, forcibly dragged him into the detention cell. Zhao resisted, and Gong and others slapped Zhao's face, causing his left eye to swell and bruise. After the City Assembly learned of this, they sent someone to the police station to negotiate and expressed their condolences to Zhao. At the same time, they located officer Zhang. By this time, Zhao, feeling that the police officers had abused their power and that his face had been assaulted and injured, refused to be released. It was not until around 12 p.m., when the Deputy Bureau Chief of the Second Precinct of the Police Bureau, Ren Shuduo, personally punished the two police officers with confinement and expressed deep remorse, that Zhao left the station. After hearing the news, Shen Pu, the director of the Municipal Police Bureau, personally went to Zhao's residence and the City Assembly at 2 p.m. to apologize, stating that he would be responsible for investigating the personnel involved. However, Zhao, feeling that the police officers had publicly insulted a city assemblyman, infringed on his personal freedom, and caused bodily harm, filed a legal complaint.

Reason for Collecting Supplementary Fare at Xujiahui Station

Reply to a Passenger: Regarding your previous letter pointing out the matter of collecting supplementary fare for fourth-class passengers at Xujiahui Station, the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Administration has replied stating: "It has been found that a considerable number of fourth-class passengers on the 68th train disembark at Xujiahui Station every day and are charged a supplementary fare. There are regulations specifying which stations on this line sell fourth-class tickets and which do not. Xujiahui Station is a station that does not sell fourth-class tickets. If passengers purchase fourth-class tickets to Shanghai West but disembark at Xujiahui Station, it is indeed not in accordance with the regulations. Xujiahui Station charges each passenger 300 yuan as a supplementary fare, which is in accordance with the regulations and is not inappropriate. A receipt numbered 77173 was issued at the time. However, according to the regulations, this receipt must be sent along with the passenger ticket to the Accounting Department of this line for review, so it must be taken back immediately after it is issued and cannot be given to the passenger to keep, causing a misunderstanding. It has also been found that the stationmaster personally supervises and railway staff members are present to observe whenever the station collects supplementary passenger tickets upon arrival of each train. In order to clarify the facts, Xujiahui Station was specially ordered to report in detail the situation of collecting supplementary fares every day from October 1st to 10th, which has been reviewed and found to be accurate," etc., and this is hereby replied.

### Review of the Draft Peace Treaties for Five European Countries; Foreign Ministers' Meeting to Be Held Today; Foreign Secretary Bevin Arrives in New York and Makes a Speech; Hopes to Overcome Difficulties with Tolerance

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 3rd] The four foreign ministers are scheduled to meet at 4 p.m. on the 4th in the pale green living room on the 37th floor of the Waldorf Astoria Hotel here, sitting around an oval table to decide the final peace terms for Germany's five satellite states. The hotel is world-renowned, and its meeting rooms are particularly opulent. The foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union will attend in person. French President and Foreign Minister Bidault, due to the upcoming general election in the country, is unable to attend and has specially appointed Deputy Foreign Minister Couve de Murville as his representative. According to well-informed sources, the request of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg for the four foreign ministers to allow them to attend the discussion on the German issue will be considered. If these countries are invited, then Germany's eastern neighbors, especially Poland and Czechoslovakia, will also have to attend. It is heard that the exploration of the German issue is under consideration, especially by Secretary of State Byrnes. Byrnes seems to insist that this issue needs to be resolved quickly, especially the issue of Germany's borders, at least regarding the western border of that country.

[Our Dispatch] London, 3rd Broadcast: British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Deputy Foreign Minister Couve de Murville arrived in New York today on the mail ship "Aquitania." On the ship, Bevin told reporters that he was neither pessimistic nor optimistic about the future of the United Nations organization. Bevin hoped that the United Nations could develop according to its original purpose, but believed that the formation of a world organization constitution would take a long time, just as the formation of the constitutions of the United States and the United Kingdom required a long time. He said, "We cannot expect the United Nations to proceed smoothly in its first year of life; difficulties are inevitable. If we do not move forward bravely, deal with all the problems, and try to understand various viewpoints, we will not be able to solve the current problems. Our main difficulty at present is that on the one hand, we must sign peace treaties, and on the other hand, we must establish the United Nations; the contradictions and conflicts between them make the problem more complicated. Therefore, we can only solve the problem step by step, and cannot solve all the problems at the same time. We cannot solve all the problems of mankind within one year; what is most needed at present is caution, patience, and tolerance." Couve de Murville said: "It is difficult to predict how the four foreign ministers' meeting will turn out. All the issues discussed in the New York meeting have been discussed in the Paris Peace Conference. Some of them were passed by a unanimous majority, others by a simple majority or a two-thirds majority, so we need to discuss again all the proposals that have not been unanimously decided."

### Disposition of Pacific Islands; the United States Will Clarify Its Policy; Internal Disagreements on Whether to Entrust Guardianship; Soviet Union Plans to Request Veto Power from the Trusteeship Committee

[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 3rd Broadcast: U.S. Secretary of the Army Patterson and Secretary of the Navy Forrest today met with Secretary of State Byrnes to urge President Truman to clearly express his views on the bases on the Pacific Islands seized from Japan, so as to avoid disputes between the State Department and the military, and to clarify the U.S. policy before the United Nations General Assembly discusses the trusteeship issue. The disagreement between the Army, Navy, and State Department began in 1944, when the military requested that the islands be incorporated into the United States. The late President Roosevelt rejected this and accepted the principle of trusteeship as a solution. It is expected that President Truman will continue to implement this policy and adopt the same position as the State Department.

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 2nd] According to today's information, the Soviet Union is preparing to propose authorizing one of the five powers to veto the United Nations Trusteeship Draft Convention. This proposal will be submitted to the UN Trusteeship Committee, which will inevitably cause a great reaction in the committee. The U.S. delegation is said to firmly oppose this proposal by the Soviet Union on the grounds that the Soviet Union has too much say over the Pacific Islands seized by the U.S. military from Japan. According to reliable sources, the Soviet representative intends to argue that the five powers of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France all have "direct relations" to the submission of the Trusteeship Draft Convention. According to the provisions of the United Nations Charter, every draft convention must be approved by the countries directly related to the trust territory, otherwise it cannot be implemented. Therefore, if the Soviet proposal is adopted, any one of the five powers may veto any trusteeship proposal.

### Britain Recommends to the General Assembly the Establishment of a Trusteeship Council

### Permanent Headquarters to Be Located in the United States; Soviet Union May Oppose

[Reuters, New York, Flushing, 2nd] When asked for his opinion on the United States' suggestion to locate the permanent headquarters of the United Nations in New York or San Francisco, Soviet representative Vyshinsky asked, "Aren't New York and San Francisco very far from the Soviet Union?" It is generally believed that Vyshinsky's words may be an indication that the Soviet Union will request a re-examination of this entire issue at the General Assembly in order to overturn the decision of the London UN Conference to establish the permanent headquarters of the United Nations in the United States.

At the same time, Ms. Eun sent a telegram to UN Secretary-General Lie, urging Chairman Lie to take swift action in view of the deteriorating situation in North Korea. It is understood that Ms. Eun's recent appeal to Lie was based on a telegram sent by Syngman Rhee, which mentioned the crisis situation in Korea, so immediate action was necessary.

### Ban on Nicotine Drugs; China Proposes New Convention; Britain, the United States, and India Express Full Support

[Reuters, New York, Lake Success, 3rd] Chinese representative Zhang Pingqun today proposed to the UN Social and Humanitarian Committee to adopt a new convention to ban nicotine drugs in order to replace the anti-drug mission of the former League of Nations. The British representative expressed full support and asked the General Assembly to unanimously support Zhang's proposal. India and Saudi Arabia also expressed full support. The U.S. representative also said that this matter does not need to be submitted to a subcommittee for review. The debate then turned to whether Spain should be allowed to participate in the signing of the convention. As a result of the vote, the recommendation of the Social and Economic Council was upheld, and Spain was refused participation in this matter, which will be directly submitted to the General Assembly for debate.

### Egypt Proposes to Eliminate Religious and Racial Discrimination

[Reuters, New York, Lake Success, 3rd] The Egyptian delegation today submitted a resolution to the UN General Assembly, requesting immediate and vigorous steps to end policies of discrimination and exclusion against religions and races. The resolution stated that after investigation in Central European countries, it was found that after the victory of democratic forces, religious minorities still suffered from cruel exclusion and discrimination, and therefore could not enjoy equal treatment with other citizens, and their situation was very difficult. Such policies of exclusion and discrimination completely disregard the basic principles of humanity and are contrary to the purposes of the United Nations. It has been decided to submit the case to the United Nations General Committee for discussion next week, which is expected to cause heated debate.

### The Elimination of Racial Acts Should Be Declared a Crime

[Reuters, New York, Lake Success, 3rd] The delegations of India, Panama, and Cuba submitted a resolution to the General Assembly, requesting the United Nations organization to declare acts to eliminate other races as the worst crime of mankind. The resolution stated that eliminating a race is denying the right to life of the entire group of people, and the nature of killing a person is the same as denying the right to life of an individual. These acts are contrary to the spirit and purpose of the United Nations organization. The act of eliminating races has become a matter of international concern, not only violates human conscience, but also causes civilization to be lost.

### Sweden, Iceland, and Afghanistan Approved to Join the United Nations

### The Spanish Issue Must Be Resolved Practically; Welles Expresses Views

[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 3rd Broadcast: Former U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles said in a nationwide broadcast today that the United Nations General Assembly's intervention in the Spanish issue is not within the scope of the United Nations Charter, but the broad issues involved in this case are basic procedural issues, not whether Spain is a fascist state. At the same time, Mr. Welles supported UN Secretary-General Lie's demand at the opening of the General Assembly that the United Nations take immediate action on Spain. Mr. Welles said that the issue of the Gotha government must be raised as much as possible at this session of the General Assembly, as this is one of the fundamental purposes of convening the General Assembly.

### Japanese Emperor Issues Edict Promulgating New Constitution; the House of Peers Will Cease to Exist

Japanese People Flock to Meiji Shrine to Pay Respects

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 3rd] Japanese Emperor Hirohito today issued an edict promulgating the new constitution, which reads: "This constitution is a complete revision of the Imperial Constitution. It seeks the foundation for national revival, stipulates that the people may freely express their will, declares that Japan automatically renounces war, and hopes for the establishment of permanent peace. We hope that the people will devote their full efforts to implement this constitution and build a civilized country." The edict was read to the members of the House of Representatives and the House of Peers. The House of Peers ceased to exist upon the promulgation of the constitution. Prime Minister Yoshida said in his reply that he was determined to do his best to comply with the Emperor's will, and the President of the House of Peers, Tokugawa, also assured that they would unite and promote the constitution.

[Remodeling Corporation, Tokyo, 3rd] Although the new Japanese constitution was promulgated this morning, many Japanese people still feel reluctant to part with the old "Imperial Constitution," especially the upper classes. Tokyo University President Nanbara said in a speech at the university this morning: "Although the national system has been changed, the foundation of the new emperor system has been established here. When we bid farewell to the Meiji Constitution, which we once called the eternal and unchangeable Grand Canon, we think of the glorious Meiji era and do not forget that the new constitution was drafted under the restrictions of the fate of defeat." These words frankly express the mood of the Japanese people. Today happens to be Meiji Day, and the Meiji Shrine, which has been deserted for a long time after the war, is suddenly lively, and worshipers flock to it. Members of the imperial family, as well as Prime Minister Yoshida and others, are among them, and the former King of Korea, Lee Eun, also went to pay his respects.

### Japan's Use of Democratic Tools Will Fundamentally Affect the Overall Situation

Former U.S. Ambassador to China Johnson Said

[Associated Press, Washington, 2nd] Johnson, the former U.S. Ambassador to China and current Director-General of the Far Eastern Commission, delivered a speech today, urging the British to pay attention to the Far East, especially Japan and China. These people, especially the Japanese, are using new democratic tools, which seem to be fundamentally affecting the overall situation in the world. The conflicting philosophical concepts of Japan and China may be said to have accelerated the Pacific War. Education is the most important thing. You should pay attention to the more than 70 million demobilized and disarmed Japanese people, and the path they will follow in the future will be of great importance to the world.

### United Nations' Difficulty, Part Two: The Issue of Territory Trusteeship (Part 1)

— Our Newspaper Archives

This issue has a long history, so let's start by recounting its origins. The term "trusteeship" first appeared in Roman law, but its large-scale implementation in the modern sense began after World War I. At that time, Germany and Turkey were defeated, and the victorious nations hesitated about how to handle some of the colonies they left behind. Should they be granted independence? These colonies did not meet the required standards in terms of politics, economy, and culture. If they were rashly granted autonomy, the result might make them targets for strong neighbors, causing endless future troubles. After careful consideration, the Versailles Peace Conference decided to treat these colonies as "mandated territories," entrusting them to a suitable power for trusteeship through the League of Nations, like a nanny taking care of an infant. The mandated territories system had goals and strategies. The countries assuming trusteeship had to make every effort to help these colonies become independent and autonomous in all aspects and report the progress to the League of Nations. Once the colony was capable of independence and autonomy, and the infant had grown up, the country assuming trusteeship could declare the mission accomplished and grant it independence. Under this system, the countries assuming the mandates were Britain, France, Australia, the Union of South Africa, New Zealand, Belgium, and Japan. Some of the mandated territories were truly able to become independent and autonomous. For example, Iraq formally declared independence in 1932. However, most of the colonies were often treated as private property by the countries assuming trusteeship, seized and held onto.

With the end of the Second World War and the defeat of the Axis powers, how to resolve the issue of the colonies and former mandated territories they left behind naturally became a difficult problem again. Naturally, everyone thought of the "trusteeship" method, which was similar to the mandate system.

The international trusteeship system is stipulated in Chapters XI, XII, and XIII of the United Nations Charter. When these sections were discussed at the San Francisco Conference, the experts and representatives truly racked their brains, arguing over every single word, often debating for weeks. This also shows how important this matter was!

At the Dumbarton Oaks Conference in August 1944, the United States had intended to propose a plan for an international trusteeship system, but because the Soviet Union had not yet declared war on Japan, discussing some of the trusteeship issues in the Pacific at this time would certainly cause trouble in the future. Therefore, the issue was not raised at all during the conference. It was not until the Yalta Conference of the Big Three in February of the following year that the trusteeship issue was formally discussed.

However, the Yalta Conference did not discuss practical issues but only some principles, roughly as follows: (1) The three powers should propose a trusteeship plan with unanimous agreement at the San Francisco Conference in May; (2) Trusteeship should include existing mandated territories, post-war enemy colonies, and territories voluntarily submitted for trusteeship by other countries; (3) The detailed distribution of trust territories would not be discussed at the San Francisco Conference for the time being. According to this last point, it was naturally still for the sake of the base issue in the Pacific because the Soviet Union had not yet declared war on Japan, making it inconvenient to discuss.

At the San Francisco Conference, after expending a great deal of effort, the articles of the international trusteeship system were finally passed in the Charter. In the draft proposed by the United States, some special "strategic zones" were delineated for the bases in the Pacific. Although this point was ultimately passed, it was strongly opposed by the Soviet representatives during the discussion. On June 26, 1945, the United Nations Charter was finally signed and established. The plan for the international trusteeship system was included in the Charter.

### "Inner Wisdom and Outer Simplicity" Viewing Sun Qingyang's Painting Exhibition

[Our Newspaper News] The Shanghai Art Association recently held Sun Qingyang's painting exhibition at the Xingwu Restaurant on the fourth floor of the Cishu Building on Nanjing East Road. According to Sun Fu Yuan, Sun's works are "inner wisdom and outer simplicity, with a level of skill that is rarely seen in the country in recent times. With a passionate heart and powerful brush, he creates a true portrayal of the times and conveys the common feelings of mankind."

Sun's exhibited works include four categories: Chinese painting, watercolor painting, sketching, and oil painting. Sun's Chinese paintings, whether figures or landscapes, still retain the traditional style in brushwork, but in terms of rendering, the volume is adjusted to conform to three-dimensional perspective. Sun's horses are highly praised. The horses in ordinary Chinese paintings are either too short in body or too long in legs. Sun's horses are simple and archaic in brushwork, while the proportions conform to anatomy, which should be attributed to his foundation in Western painting. The "South China East Mountain" and "Jade Tiger Pulling Silk to Draw Well" in this exhibition are rare good paintings.

Watercolor painting is extremely difficult because it is difficult to correct a bad stroke. Sun's watercolor paintings include landscapes, and more works that are sensitive to the times. The Thousand Character Classic watercolor painting is one example. It uses the sentences of the Thousand Character Classic, one by one, to give new explanations, making them closely related to the real social situation, and then forms a series of pictures to express various social phenomena. In addition, "New Stories in Painting" also uses ancient people and ancient events, such as Zhuo Wenjun, Princess Shouyang, and the Battle of Gaixia, to express a new consciousness.

In general, Sun Qingyang's works have the beauty of being profound yet easy to understand. Art masters will certainly recognize them as extraordinary, and ordinary people can also appreciate them.

### Pigeon Racing: Nanjing Cup to Be Held Next Month

Since its establishment, the Chinese Victory Pigeon Association has actively developed its affairs, guiding its members to study and improve pigeon breeds and train pigeons for long-distance flights. During the first visit of the chairman to Shanghai and the recent celebration of his 60th birthday, the association released peace pigeons at the Racecourse and the Ningbo Fellow Association, showing their congratulations. The pigeons soared into the sky, creating a spectacular sight. This year, the juvenile pigeon race between Shanghai and Xixi, a distance of 128 kilometers, was held on Double Ten Day. The pigeon of member Zhang Yongqing flew back in 2 hours and 10 minutes, winning the championship, which was truly commendable. It is now learned that in order to continue to strengthen the long-distance transmission efficiency of homing pigeons, the association has decided to continue to hold the second race on the Nanjing-Shanghai line. Friendship races will be held in Changzhou on the 10th of this month and in Danyang on the 24th, and then the Cup race will be officially held in Nanjing, the endpoint of the Nanjing-Shanghai line, on the 8th of next month. The entire route is more than 290 kilometers long. Zhu Yongnian and Chen Feipeng will still be responsible for the release. The homing pigeons participating in the competition are limited to young pigeons hatched this year.

### Coordinating Water and Land Transportation Networks in Line with the Greater Shanghai Plan: Planning to Improve Traffic on Nanjing Road

In order to coordinate the city's water and land transportation and to cooperate with the overall plan of the Greater Shanghai urban plan, the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities is actively preparing for the Municipal Ferry Company, and has merged the original Public Bus Committee and Tramway Preparation Office to form the Shanghai Transportation Company Preparatory Committee, which is dedicated to coordinating, planning, and organizing the Shanghai land transportation network. It is learned that the initial plan of the Transportation Company is to try to open up public buses in the urban and suburban areas as much as possible within March, so as to connect with the French public buses and complete the transportation network of public buses in the city. The second step of the work plan has not yet been determined, but it mainly involves reorganizing road rights and the rights of tramways and public buses to operate. It is verified that although the British public bus company still has years remaining on its operating rights, the company's vehicles have been completely damaged and have not yet been restored. The Bureau of Public Utilities has now set a deadline for it to resume operations by the end of this month, otherwise its operating rights will be taken over by the city. As for the British tram company's operating rights, they will expire on October 9 next year. Recently, the Municipal Council suggested that it be taken over by the city, and the Municipal Government also planned to buy all the assets of the company. As for the French tram company and public bus company's operating rights, they still have several years remaining. The Bureau is carefully considering whether to take back the operating rights in advance.

Since the implementation of traffic improvements in the central area of the city on September 9 of this year, the number of traffic accidents during the specified time has gradually decreased. It is learned that the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, in view of the fact that the number of vehicles heading west on Nanjing Road and Beijing Road is twice as crowded after the various agencies and offices close at around 5:00 PM, is now preparing to improve the situation again in order to solve the traffic difficulties on these two roads. It is said that the above issue will be submitted to the recent traffic conference for discussion.

### Bloody Young Woman in Taoyuanfang, Tiantong Road: Tragedy Occurs After Divorce

### A Fox Fur Coat Costs Millions; Where Can Anyone Find the Extra Money for a New One? Furriers' Business Is Depressed

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] From the chorus of complaints of furriers, one can glimpse the ailing state of this outwardly glamorous city, with a cancerous tumor of economic depression festering deep in its heart!

Originally, the cold weather should be the time to buy winter furs. However, transactions at the counters of various fur shops are as deserted as graveyards. It is said that the daily retail turnover of several major furriers at the Canidrome is no more than two to three million yuan. Have the city's sons and daughters forgotten to be fashionable? It doesn't seem so!

Let's hear the furriers speak frankly. They say: the long, hot weather this year is an "immediate cause." The distant cause is that most industries in the market this year are depressed. The speculative businesses that once dominated the scene have also disappeared one by one. Since there is no industry making a fortune, where will the customers come from?

Furthermore, the fur business itself requires heavy capital, and the threat of high-interest loans is a constant concern. The time available for business each year is only from October to March on the lunar calendar. The profit and loss of the entire year depends on this one season. According to their years of statistics, people who want to buy new furs usually prepare before the Lunar New Year. Once the Lunar New Year is over, no matter how cold the spring weather, there will be few inquiries about new furs! In their business eyes, the depressed market this year seems to foreshadow a bleak season for them!

Types and Origins of Furs

The reporter was unwilling to let the conversation sink further into gloom, so he steered it towards the issue of the furs themselves. The furriers then enumerated the types and origins of the furs as if counting their treasures. To mention the more prominent ones, the southern regions have tiger, otter, spotted cat, and badger skins from Yunnan; and white deer from Guizhou and Zhejiang. The northern regions have sheep and fox skins from Gansu, Xinjiang, Mongolia, and Chahar. The Northeast is particularly a hotbed for the production of furs. It is said that it produces skins of squirrel, yellow weasel, raccoon, fox, sable, and other species.

Fur coats have a history full of vicissitudes in the evolution of Shanghai fashion. In the past, during the era of autocratic emperors, fur coats were considered the product of the nobility. Wearing furs was also hierarchical. Certain people were only allowed to wear certain types of fur, and if they exceeded the limit, not only would the government not allow it, but they would also be ridiculed among their peers. There was even a saying at the time: "First-rank officials wear black fox, second-rank wear sable, third and fourth-rank wear Japanese knife (otter)." How long ago was it that the tide of democracy swept away all the remnants of this era? Fur coats have been "popularized" to those with general economic means. Then, as Western trends gradually spread eastward, gentlemen seemed even more sensitive than ladies. Over the past decade, Western suits have become prevalent. Gentlemen who are used to wearing Western suits mostly abandoned heavy fur coats for winter, opting for thick woolen overcoats. Even those who wear traditional Chinese robes prefer light and warm silk-cotton robes, topped with a worsted wool coat. This has invisibly reduced the need for fur coats. The blow suffered by the fur industry as a result has been severe enough.

Relying Entirely on the Ladies

However, what is lost in the east is gained in the west. Fortunately, in the past four or five years, the city's ladies have not been willing to lag behind. They have also adopted European styles in their clothing, like the gentlemen. In this era, a woman wearing a Western suit and trousers on the street will certainly not be seen as a monster. Therefore, overcoats for keeping warm also followed suit. I remember that women's overcoats used to be mostly made of woolen fabric or even serge. Even if they made a fur coat, the fur side was mostly used as the lining. However, fashionable European and American women prefer to have the fur side facing outwards. As a result, this type of fur coat has become popular starting four or five years ago and has reached its peak in the last two years! Rich women ask their husbands, or the men who are passionately pursuing them, to order one from a fashion store. Daughters from moderately wealthy families, even if they can't ask someone to make one for them, will secretly ask their parents, digging out an old fur coat from their father's wardrobe and handing it over to the tailors in the fashion store for a "magical revival." As long as the fur is turned to the outside, isn't it also a luxurious and elegant fur coat? This fierce determination to be beautiful among fashionable ladies has ultimately supported the currently depressed fur industry. No wonder the furriers smile broadly and treat the ladies who come to the counter to buy fur coats with utmost care.

According to the furriers, the most popular types of fur coats in Shanghai (meaning the best-selling ones) are raccoon, cat, white deer, and sheepskin. The biggest use for these types of fur is to make reversible fur-lined women's coats. Other types of fur, such as black fox, white fox, gray back, leopard skin, and sable, are also used to make women's coats, but their sales volume is limited.

Cat Skin Prices Have Increased the Most

When talking about the market price of various goods, the furriers couldn't help but start calculating on their abacuses. It is said that the average price of various furs has increased by four to five thousand times compared to before the war. If we take a single example, the increase in prices of noble furs such as black fox and white fox is the smallest, only a thousand times compared to before the war. However, unexpectedly, the increase in the price of cat skin, which used to be the cheapest fur, is the highest, estimated to be ten thousand times. The reporter couldn't help but doubt the truth of this statement. However, the furriers explained it well: cat skins are mostly taken from domestic cats. In recent years, labor costs have greatly increased. From skinning, washing, tanning, to piecing together a fur coat, it is unknown how much labor costs are required. Furthermore, in recent years, war has raged everywhere, and people are starving. People can't even feed themselves, so who has the extra energy to raise cats? With fewer cats, there are also fewer cat skins, and the price of fur has naturally increased along with it. This statement contains so much bitterness.

Let me tell you, fashionable gentlemen and ladies! The current price of furs is as follows: for gentlemen's fur coats, made of white sheepskin, each costs from 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Those made of squirrel skin cost from 500,000 to 1,000,000 yuan each. Fox fur coats cost about 700,000 to 800,000 yuan each. More expensive fine fox fur robes cost about 1,500,000 to 1,600,000 yuan each. Other rare sable furs, because they are produced in Russia and there is not much stock in Shanghai, are also priced extraordinarily high. Those who have one or two pieces are selling and buying them as if they were antiques. It is said that the market price ranges from 2,000,000 to 3,000,000 yuan to over 8,000,000 yuan each.

White Deer Sells the Most

For ladies' reversible fur-lined coats, the most popular white deer coats cost from 700,000 to 800,000 yuan to 1,200,000 to 1,300,000 yuan each. Cat fur coats cost from 400,000 to 600,000 yuan each. Spotted cat fur coats cost from 500,000 to 700,000 yuan each. Dyed sheepskin coats cost from 400,000 to 600,000 yuan each. Raccoon coats cost from 500,000 to 700,000 yuan each. More expensive yellow weasel, black fox, gray back, and leopard skin coats cost about 1,000,000 to 2,000,000 yuan each.

From the above market prices, it can be seen that the price range of the same type of goods is very large. This illustrates the complexity of the types of fur. The price varies depending on the density and looseness of the fur, the length of the guard hair, the color of the fur, the number of animals used for each fur coat, the complexity of the skinning, washing, and tanning process, and the size of the fur coat. These are certainly not things that those who wear fur coats would pay attention to.

Finally, the furriers presented their accurate estimates. They said: currently, two-thirds of the business in the fur industry depends on ladies' reversible fur-lined coats. The business that can be done with gentlemen's fur coats is less than one-third. Last year, when victory first arrived, it was said that after eight years of long-term resistance against the war, once the economy recovered, people could buy a new fur coat to celebrate the victorious New Year. However, sadly, last winter, the total turnover of the five major furriers at the Canidrome was only 300 million yuan. What a small number this is! At this point, the furriers returned to their initial complaints. Although it is bitter, there is an undeniable reality. For example, before the war, there were a total of thirty-four fur businesses, large and small. During the eight years of war, the source of furs was cut off. Without furs, what could the fur industry rely on? In the end, some closed down, some rested, and only eleven fur businesses of various sizes remained. More unfortunately, even these limited eleven fur businesses are unable to withstand the pressure of the current economic depression. Fashionable sons and daughters, are you moved by this? They are eagerly waiting for you to extend a warm hand to give them compassionate assistance!

### Suggestions for Workers' Cost of Living Index; The General Labor Union Receives a Reply from the Municipal Government

Regarding the calculation of the cost of living index for workers in this city, after Zhou Shishu, a representative from the Municipal Government's Cost of Living Index Compilation Office, went to the Municipal General Labor Union to explain the calculation method of the index, representatives from various industry unions have successively raised inquiries and suggestions to the Municipal General Labor Union, which were summarized into seven items, the details of which have been reported in the newspaper. Upon investigation, the suggestions were forwarded by the Municipal General Labor Union to the Municipal Government, and a reply from the Municipal Government was received yesterday, stating: "According to the second item presented (canceling soybeans and wheat bran in the food category of the index table and improving the quality of Xian rice), from the perspective of nutritional considerations, polishing rice is actually detrimental to nutrition. The nutritional value of brown rice is far superior to that of high-quality white rice. The request should not be discussed. As for the remaining suggestions, they have been submitted to relevant departments for discussion to prepare for adoption."

### No Land for Burial; Health Authorities Advocate Cremation

The Municipal Health Bureau has recently been rectifying the city's sanitary environment. Plans have been made to improve various markets, vegetable markets, cemeteries, and slaughterhouses. The city's funeral parlors have been ordered not to allow coffins to be kept any longer, and there is currently no space for burial plots in public cemeteries, which is causing difficulties for the general public. A reporter visited the person in charge of the bureau, who said: due to the excessive accumulation of coffins over the past eight years, the cemetery space is limited. The existing public cemeteries are unable to cope with the existing coffins, and it is even more difficult to deal with those who have recently died. Therefore, the bureau intends to actively promote cremation and add public cemeteries to facilitate burials for the public. In addition to the existing Hongqiao, Wanguo, and Panyu cemeteries in the western district of Shanghai, and the First Cemetery in the northern district of Shanghai, privately owned land will be leased near the existing cemeteries for expansion. Land will also be sought in the Yangshupu area in the eastern district of Shanghai and the Pudong area in the southern district of Shanghai for construction.

### A Study of Shanghai Street Names

When we look down at this world-class metropolis from the Shanghai sky, the dense buildings are separated by many roads, like a chessboard, perhaps even denser. These many horizontal and vertical arteries intertwine to create the prosperity of Shanghai. A person returning from the rear after the war, even if he is an "old Shanghai resident," will feel unfamiliar when he sees these many street names, because they have already undergone a major change. During the enemy's puppet regime, Shanghai street names were changed once. After the victory, the remnants left by the enemy's puppet regime naturally could not be allowed to remain, and the old street names were no longer applicable, so they were changed again, which can be said to be a three-time change of name. Shanghai street names have been changed more than once individually, but these two times were thorough changes, so everyone paid special attention. However, everyone has not yet firmly remembered these many new street names. When the tram arrives at the station, the ticket seller still calls out the old street names. When hiring a rickshaw, if you use the new street names, the rickshaw puller will stare blankly and not know what to do. Habit dictates that it will take time to promote them.

### Alternative Street Names

There are many places in Shanghai whose names are inexplicable and cannot be found on the map. These many colloquial names of roads often make people who come to Shanghai for the first time at a loss. Now, let's list them side by side for reference. (Colloquial Name) (Old Street Name) Stone Road Fujian Road Daxin Street Hubei Road Little Garden, Zhejiang Road Guangxi Road Hankou Road area

### The Origin of the Name "Stone Road"

This Fujian Road, where clothing stores gather, is commonly known as Stone Road. What is the reason for this? Thirty years ago, Shanghai roads, except for Nanking Road and Szechuan Road, which were made of fire bricks or iron elm wood, were all made of a mixture of sand and gravel. In addition, there were stone roads made of small and large crushed stones. When the concession was first opened, residents took water from Yangjingbang and Suzhou Creek. They went there together when the tide rose in the morning and evening. Daggou Bridge on Yangjingbang, Zhengjia Wooden Bridge, and Sanji Wharf on Suzhou Creek were all important water collection points. The roads near there were all paved with crushed stone pieces, which could prevent those who drew water from slipping and prevent the roads from collapsing due to water. Because Fujian Road connects the north and south waterways, it is entirely paved with crushed stone pieces, hence the name.

There is another legend. During the Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty, there was a wealthy family named Li living on the east side of the county government in the city. His daughter married into the Qu family in the northern end of the Lao Zha Bridge. The Qu family was also wealthy, which can be said to be a good match. At this time, the concession had not been opened, and the roads outside the city were rugged and crisscrossed, making travel very inconvenient. The Li family bought thousands of large stones and hired people to pave them from Yangjingbang, along Fujian Road, all the way north to Lao Zha Bridge, placing one stone every foot, making it more convenient for his daughter to send her abundant dowry when she got married. From then on, it was known as Stone Road, which can also be said to be a "heroic act."

Some people also say that Stone Road should be written as Zha Road, and Zha refers to Lao Zha.

### The Origin of the Name "Peng Road"

The road in front of the North Railway Station, which is the dividing line between China and the West, was previously called Boundary Road. The predecessor of Boundary Road was Wenchamshi Road, also known as Peng Road, which is translated from the English pronunciation.

Why is Wenchamshi Road called Luo Feng Road in English? There is a story behind it.

At that time, there was an American Episcopal Church Bishop named Boone, who, due to his frequent contact with Chinese people, also took a local Chinese name, called Wen Huilian. After the British and French successively opened concessions, the Americans were very envious and also hoped to have a concession. Wen Huilian wanted to build a church in Hongkou at that time, so he negotiated with the Shanghai Daotai. In 1848, the Shanghai Daotai generally designated the Hongkou area as a residential area for American expatriates, so Wen Huilian was actually the founder of the American concession.

Such an important figure who contributed to the history of the concession should naturally have his name moved to the road as a memorial. The English name is still called "Peng Road," and the Chinese name uses his Chinese surname. The bishop was formerly translated as Jianshi, so it became "Wenchamshi Road." However, this Chinese name seems a bit inexplicable, and the English name is very simple to read, so everyone calls it "Peng Road." Friends who don't usually walk on the road much will never find Peng Road. Peng Road is now renamed Tianmu Road

### How Were the New Street Names Changed?

Shanghai street names were all translated from Western languages during the concession period. They were not easy to pronounce or remember, and some even had a bit of a "foreign" feel. After the Pacific War broke out, the enemy and puppet forces entered the concession and changed the street names. After the victory, the remnants of the enemy and puppet regime had to be removed, and restoring the old names was also considered inappropriate, so they were changed again.

This time, the government divided the city center into a grid. Zhongshan Road surrounds the outside, and Zhongzheng Road runs horizontally and vertically through it. Zhongshan Road originally started from Longhua, went west and north, and then reached Zhabei. This time, Huangpu Road was changed to Zhongshan East Road, Limar Road and Kangqu Road were changed to Zhongshan South Road, and then connected to the original Zhongshan Road, forming a large circle. Although there is still a gap, it has almost completely included the city area.

In the center of this circle, two more vertical and horizontal main lines are drawn. The original Avenue Edward VII, Avenue Foch, and Great Western Road from east to west. This long and wide road is naturally the main thoroughfare of Shanghai, and it was renamed Zhongzheng East Road, Zhongzheng Central Road, and Zhongzheng West Road. The original Rue Paul Henry, Rue des Soeurs, Avenue du Roi Albert, and Carter Road from the southern city to the north were renamed Zhongzheng South Road and Zhongzheng North Road.

"Unification" is the principle of renaming. All two or three connected roads are changed to a unified name and divided by east, west, north, and south. The roads from east to west will merge the original Ningbo Road (former French concession), Avenue Joffre, and Lujia Road into Linsen Road. The original Zhaojia Road, Avenue Lafayette, and Baiqi Central Road are merged into Fuxing Road. The original Route Conty, Avenue Haig, and Route Ferguson are merged into Jianguo Road. The original Bubbling Well Road is renamed Nanjing West Road, and the original Avenue Haig is renamed Beijing West Road. The same is true from south to north, and there are very good boundaries to divide them into South Road, Central Road, and North Road, namely Suzhou Creek and the boundary between the former Public Concession and the French Concession. All roads east of Tibet Road, north of Suzhou Creek, are North Road, those in the former French Concession are South Road, and those in the former Public Concession are Central Road. Following the example of the former Public Concession, Chinese place names are used.

Most of the newly renamed roads are named after place names, but there are a few exceptions. Zhongshan, Zhongzheng, and Linsen Roads are all named after people. Route Saipo Sai Road was renamed Yingshi Road to commemorate the martyr Chen Yingshi, because Mr. Yingshi's former residence was on Route Saipo Sai Road.

### Classification of Street Names

Shanghai street names can be roughly divided into several categories. (1) Those that use Chinese province names and place names are the easiest to remember. Demar Road in the central area of the former Public Concession was like this, such as Nanjing Road, Jiujiang Road, Hankou Road, Zhejiang Road, Jiangxi Road, and so on. There are many in the Hongkou and Zhabei areas. (2) Those named after buildings, such as Bubbling Well Road named after the Jing'an Temple, Consulate Road named after the French Consulate, Vegetable Market Road near the small vegetable market, and Yu Garden Road near the Yu Garden. (3) Those that follow old place names, such as Xiaoshadu Road because it leads to Xiaoshadu and Xujiahui Road because it leads to Xujiahui.

Almost half of Shanghai's street names use foreign names, mostly personal names, including diplomats stationed in China, consuls stationed in Shanghai, missionaries, expatriate merchants, former directors of the Municipal Council, and directors of the Public Works Bureau, who were directly or indirectly related to Shanghai.

There are not many street names that use foreign place names, such as Tokyo Road and He Wan Road, which cannot be included as examples of foreign place names, and there are also Hong Kong Road, Macau Road, etc., which cannot be regarded as foreign place names.

There are also very few street names named after Chinese people. There are only a few because the concession was in the hands of foreigners in the past, and they did not pay attention to the Chinese. These few were only willing to put their names on the street signs due to special relationships.

### Avenue Joffre

This Avenue Joffre, which is considered mysterious and prosperous, is both poetic and historically meaningful.

Avenue Joffre was originally one of the roads built by the former French Concession beyond its boundaries. It was officially included in the boundary after the third expansion of the concession in the third year of the Republic of China. This road stretches from Jieti Road in the east to Haig Road in the west, measuring 5,500 meters in length, and is the longest and straightest road in the former French Concession, now called Linsen Central Road.

Avenue Joffre was originally named Avenue Beauchamp. The name "Beauchamp" is the name of a director of the former French Municipal Council. He was continuously elected for seventeen times, from 1881 to 1907, and also served as the general manager six times. The construction of Avenue Joffre was decided in 1900 and completed in 1901. At this time, Beauchamp was serving as the general manager, so the road was named Avenue Beauchamp.

During the First World War, the commander-in-chief of the French Eastern Army saved France from the brink of death with the Battle of the Marne, which was a great achievement. Joffre had been to Shanghai in 1885, when he was only a junior engineering officer. Because of this connection, the authorities of the former French Concession renamed the most important and prosperous Avenue Beauchamp to Avenue Joffre. At that time, General Joffre specially sent a letter of thanks amidst his military duties. After the end of the European War, General Joffre came to Shanghai for sightseeing on March 9, 1922. At that time, there was a grand occasion on Avenue Joffre, and the name of Avenue Joffre was officially announced on that day.

Avenue Beauchamp, which was named after Beauchamp's seventeen years of service in the concession, has since become a historical relic. In the triangle between Avenue Joffre, Rue Bayle, and Route Mercier, a triangular plot was opened as a park in 1920, named Beauchamp Park, as a replacement souvenir, which is now renamed Dihua Children's Republic.

### "Avenue Edward VII" Transformed from Yangjing Canal: Canal Filling and Road Construction Took More Than Two Years

Filling the riverbanks and building roads was the first act of kindness by foreigners after Shanghai opened as a port. This land, once full of rivers and ditches a century ago, has now been transformed. The widest of these, Avenue Edward VII, was created by rebuilding the Yangjing Canal.

The Yangjing Canal was originally a small waterway, serving as the boundary between the old British and French Concessions. Before the widespread use of tap water, this canal, along with the Suzhou Creek, was where residents obtained water. However, it was extremely filthy, with manure boats and firewood boats gathering in the canal. In summer, people passing by would cover their noses.

The earliest bridges, such as the San Mao Ge Bridge, Zhengjia Wooden Bridge, and West New Bridge, were all dilapidated wooden structures. Later, in 1856, the British and French Concessions planned to build a bridge over the Yangjing Canal to connect the Bunds of the two concessions. The bridge was completed on March 25, 1856. It was 69 feet long, 30 feet wide, and had three arches, all constructed with Singapore timber. The ends of the bridge were made of granite, costing a total of more than 2,000 silver dollars.

By 1914, both concessions felt that this stinking canal had no need to exist and decided to fill it in and convert it into a road. The project of filling the canal and paving the road took more than two years, and was completed in 1916. Before the road was built, the earliest name for the area along the Yangjing Canal was Yangjing Canal Bund Road, later changed to Songjiang Road. When the road was completed, it was renamed Avenue Edward VII, which is now East Zhongzheng Road. This name was taken from King Edward VII of England, and the pronunciation and spelling were based on the French version, hence "Edward."

After the Yangjing Canal was filled, there was also a negotiation regarding the issue of water access to the Huangpu River. According to the concession agreements, the old British Concession was bounded to the south by the Yangjing Canal, and the old French Concession was bounded to the north by the Yangjing Canal. Therefore, the Yangjing Canal waterway was not within either the British or French Concessions. In the summer of the eleventh year of the Republic of China (1922), the Pudong Reclamation Bureau proposed using the mouth of the Yangjing Canal as a ferry terminal, but this was not agreed to by the authorities of the former two concessions, and the plan was not realized. In the spring of the twenty-third year of the Republic of China (1934), the Municipal Public Works Bureau again consulted with the former Shanghai Municipal Council, and as a result, the former Shanghai Municipal Council moved the original Pier 15 on the Bund outside Beijing Road southward, freeing up suitable shoreline for the construction of a municipal ferry terminal, which is the current municipal ferry terminal.

The upstream of the Yangjing Canal was originally called North Chang Canal, and after Avenue Edward VII, it was changed to a road, initially called Daxi Road, also known as Changbang Road, named after the canal. During the First World War, the French Army General Foch achieved great merit, so Changbang Road was renamed Foch Road, which is now East Zhongzheng Road.

### Memories Left Over from the Taiping Rebellion

Shanghai has three roads that are related to the historical events of the Taiping Rebellion: Xujiahui Road, Haig Road (now Huashan Road), and Gordon Road (now Jiangning Road). In 1860, the Taiping army defeated the Qing army besieging Nanjing, then attacked Changzhou and Suzhou, causing great shock in Shanghai. Shanghai Daotai (local governor) Wu Xu requested the assistance of British and French troops for defense on one hand, and hired the American Frederick Townsend Ward to organize a foreign army, later known as the Ever Victorious Army.

On August 17th of that year, the Taiping army advanced to Xujiahui. The 25 French troops stationed there had already withdrawn, and Shanghai entered a state of war. For the convenience of troop movements, a military road was begun, from the west gate of Shanghai County, along Fangbang Bridge to Xujiahui, which is now Xujiahui Road. Later, the Ever Victorious Army led by Ward also built a road, starting from the banks of the Suzhou Creek, passing through Fahua Town, and reaching Xujiahui. When the military affairs ended, the former Shanghai Municipal Council repaired it, and also named the section from Jing'an Temple to Xujiahui as Xujiahui Road. In 1914, the old French Concession expanded to Xujiahui, and the southern section of this road became the boundary road between the French and Chinese areas. After the end of World War I, in commemoration of the British General Haig's wartime achievements, it was renamed Haig Road from 1921 onwards.

Gordon

was a staff officer for the British garrison at the time. In 1862, when the Taiping army attacked Shanghai for the third time, he assisted Li Hongzhang in capturing Shanghai County, and successively recovered Kunshan, Songjiang, Suzhou, and other places, achieving considerable merit. After the affair was settled, the road was named after Gordon in commemoration.

Jassief was the name of a French warship that arrived in Shanghai in the spring of 1853. At that time, the Taiping army was attacking Nanjing, and the Shanghai Daotai wanted to borrow it to go to Nanjing to help the Qing army fight. However, the French Consul Montigny refused, and the matter was dropped. Although the matter did not succeed, the name of this French warship was left behind as the name of a road in Shanghai.

### Alcock Road: In Memory of the Most Detestable British Consul

In Hongkou, there was a road called "Alcock Road," which has now been renamed Anguo Road. This road starts from the location of the Ward Road Prison, slightly westward to the north, and can directly reach the eastern end of Yuezhou Road, near the boundary of the former International Settlement. The road is not very long, and it is not considered particularly important. However, from the perspective of the history of the former International Settlement, it is quite relevant.

Alcock was the second British Consul in Shanghai, taking office in 1846. In older books, it is translated as Ali Guo. After taking office, he engaged in many brash incidents.

The area outside the Waibaidu Bridge (Garden Bridge) on the Bund, where the British Consulate is now located, was purchased as a base. The initiative to purchase the land was started by the first British Consul, Balfour, but Alcock followed suit, continued negotiations, and finally obtained the approval of his government. In 1848, the area of the former British Concession expanded from 830 mu (approximately 137 acres) to 2,820 mu (approximately 466 acres). This was also the result of negotiations between Alcock and the Shanghai Daotai Lin Gui at the time.

Alcock Humiliates and Beats the Shanghai Daotai

In the year of the concession expansion, a conflict occurred between British missionaries and grain boat sailors in the Qingpu area near Shanghai. The injured missionary returned to Shanghai and reported to the consulate. Alcock immediately visited the Shanghai Daotai, unilaterally siding with the British missionary and demanding that the perpetrators be punished and compensation paid. At this time, the Shanghai Daotai was no longer Lin Gui, and he was not afraid of "foreign" flattery. He told him in a serious tone, "A petty quarrel is not worth investigating deeply." Who knew that Alcock, upon hearing this, became enraged, forgetting his status as a dignified diplomat, and picked up the long-handled whip in his hand to beat the Shanghai Daotai's head. Such a barbaric act could only be met with a dismissive departure in the Shanghai Daotai's office, where weak nations had no diplomacy. He said to the Shanghai County Magistrate Jin Xian, "Shanghai's jurisdiction is a mix of Chinese and foreigners. Civil fights are extremely common. Asking me to suppress my own people to curry favor with foreigners, I would rather lose my official position." However, in the end, Li Xingyuan, the superior Liangjiang Governor, fearing trouble, accepted Alcock's unreasonable demands, arrested ten Pudong sailors, sent them to the British Consulate, displayed them in stocks on the Bund, and paid 200 taels of silver as medical expenses to the injured missionary. It's a pity that the righteous Shanghai Daotai was beaten for nothing.

Promoted to Minister: Ambitious and Arrogant

After the rise of the Taiping Rebellion, the former concession adopted a so-called armed neutrality policy, arbitrarily revised the land regulations, and organized the Shanghai Municipal Council. To trace the origins of this, Alcock was also one of the initiators. Perhaps it was for these achievements that he was later promoted to minister to China. After becoming minister, he was very protective of the Shanghai Municipal Council, which he had created. Contrary to the original intentions of the former British Minister Bruce and the American Minister to China, Anson Burlingame, he revised the land regulations that had already been approved by the foreign taxpayers in the former concession, deleting the section in the articles that included Chinese advisory committee members. Alcock's style was not only biased against China, but he also had a desire to dominate the Shanghai Municipal Council, not hesitating to use his authority to overturn the original plan.

Willful and Arbitrary: Bad Impression

Alcock was willful and arbitrary, and the Chinese had an extremely negative impression of him. The elders of Shanghai called him the British consul with the worst attitude. However, the British government was very pleased with his work in China, and therefore, the British Emperor bestowed upon him the title of knight.

### Roads Named After Chinese People

In the former concession roads named after foreigners were numerous, but roads named after Chinese people were pitifully few. The most well-known was Zhu Bao San Road, once renamed Yu Qiaqing Road, and a not very well-known Lin Gui Road.

Lin Gui Road is north of Pu Shi Road and south of Ju Ji Da Road, a short, dirty alley. This was the earliest road in the concession named after a Chinese person, in memory of Shanghai Daotai Lin Gui. Due to a mistake, "Lin" was written as "Ling," and it became Ling Gui Road. Lin Gui was a Manchu. He served as Shanghai Daotai in 1849. Although he came from an official examination background, he did not shed his rough habits. The existence of the French Concession in Shanghai was due to Lin Gui's ambiguous agreement. Therefore, from the French perspective, Lin Gui was worthy of gratitude, so they used this road to commemorate this Shanghai Daotai. This was the only road at that time named after a Chinese person.

In the past, during the heyday of American goods sales, Zhu Bao San Road was bustling with people. This was to commemorate the Shanghai merchant Zhu Bao San. Zhu Bao San, from Dinghai, had been engaged in business in Shanghai for a long time. He served as the president of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce from 1918 to 1920 and had a high position in the business community, owning a considerable amount of real estate. It is said that the land for Zhu Bao San Road also belonged to the Zhu family. However, the reason his name was written on the street sign was not because of his real estate, but because the French Concession had received a lot of help from Zhu in the beginning. Zhu Bao San Road has now been renamed Hankou Road.

Yu Qiaqing was also a prominent Ningbo merchant in Shanghai, who served as the president of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and a Chinese director of the Shanghai Municipal Council. Chinese and foreigners alike recognized that he often served the community and established many public welfare undertakings in the concession. Therefore, on his seventieth birthday, Xizang Road was renamed Yu Qiaqing Road in commemoration. When the Yu Qiaqing Road naming ceremony was held on October 1, 1936, it was quite a grand occasion. The Chinese team of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, founded by Yu, paraded on the road, which made them look even more powerful. But this road has now been renamed Xizang Road.

### Original Road Names in the Early Years of the Shanghai Concessions

In the early years of the opening of the Shanghai concessions, although the area was small and there were not many roads, the road names were very chaotic and lacked any system. At the same time, there were many similar or approximate road names, which made it even more confusing. Most of these road names were given by foreigners for their own use, and if they were translated into Chinese, they would be very unpleasant to read. Now, I will list many of the original road names of the old British Concession below:

Sichuan Road, initially named Quan Street, was soon renamed Jiangsu Road.

Jiangxi Road: originally Church Street

Henan Road: Boundary Street

Shandong Road: Temple Street

Shanxi Road: Old Gate Road

Tianjin Road: Ball Field Lane

Beijing Road: Consulate Road

Nanjing Road: Garden Lane

Jiujiang Road: Towpath Road

Hankou Road: Customs Road

Fujian Road: Church Road

Guangxi Road: India Road

These were many of the most original road names in the concession. It was not until the end of 1865 that a strict resolution was passed, changing the north-south roads within the boundary to Chinese province names, and the east-west roads to the names of important Chinese cities. These are the names that people generally call today.

The roads in the Hongkou area were named after Indian place names. The translations of these road names into Chinese (transliterations) are as follows:

济宁路 (Jining Road): Elgin Road

河间路 (Hejian Road): Bombay Road

置州路 (Zhizhou Road): Colombo Road

黑龙路 (Heilong Road): Calcutta Road

凉州路 (Liangzhou Road): Kabul Road

临清路 (Linqing Road): Kandahar Road

宁国路 (Ningguo Road): Lahore Road

宁武路 (Ningwu Road): Lucknow Road

眉州路 (Meizhou Road): Karachi Road

海州路 (Haizhou Road): Benares Road

桂阳路 (Guiyang Road): Cawnpore Road

平凉路 (Pingliang Road): Madras Road

"Indian writing is inherently difficult to read, and these many road names were really too difficult to remember. The former Shanghai Municipal Council, fearing that the Chinese would find it difficult to read, felt that these many road names would never be popular. Therefore, in 1915, a new batch of road names was redefined to replace these hard-to-remember Indian words, and they have been used ever since."

### Jessfield Road: A Love Story

The origin of the name Jessfield Road, which stretches from Jing'an Temple and Yuyuan Road to Brenan Road, has a very interesting romantic story.

"A Portuguese man living on Jessfield Road, one day in Hongkou, passed by the tent of a circus and heard a woman sobbing sadly. This aroused his curiosity, and he went inside to inquire. It turned out that the poor girl was sad because she could not bear the abuse of the circus master. The Portuguese man was filled with compassion and paid a price to redeem the girl.

After the girl left the circus, she was taken in by the church and later sent to the United States to study. Several years later, she returned to Shanghai, grateful for the Portuguese man's kindness, and married him.

The girl's name was Jess. So the Portuguese man named the road where he lived Jessfield Road. Later, even Caojiadu was called Jessfield Village, Zhaofeng Park was called Jessfield Park, and the West Station was also called Jessfield Station. Jessfield Road has now been renamed Fanwangdu Road.

### Roads with the Same Name

Shanghai's many diverse roads are already difficult to distinguish, and the streets with the same name in the past made it even more confusing.

Ningbo Road: one south of Beijing Road, one between Minguo Road and Montigny Road in the former French Concession.

Washington Road: one east of Taopeng Road in Hongkou, one near Guangfu Road in Zhabei.

Taiwan Road: one east of Fujian Road, one between the Bund and Minguo Road.

Fujian Road: one west of Shanxi Road, one between the Bund and Minguo Road.

Minhang Road: one connected to Wusong Road, one on Yanghang Street in the former French Concession.

Guildhall Lane: one between Wai Ma Road and Xiangua Street in Nanshi, one in the South City on Ci Xi Street, one on Zhoushan Road in the former French Concession on Yanghang Street.

Tangjia Lane: Fumin Road, east of the former collapsed Shuiqiao Tu, is Zhong Tangjia Lane, further east is Dong Tangjia Lane, and the west is simply called Tangjia Lane. The above are all within the city. Between North Henan Road and North Zhejiang Road in the former International Settlement, the original site of the former Xu Garden was also called Tangjia Lane.

Meijia Lane: one at the entrance of Dong Tangjia Lane in the city, one on Dongjiadu Street in Nanshi, one in the southwest countryside, which is Meijia Lane Town.

Yong'an Street: one at the Gongyi Wharf in Nanshi, one east of Tianzhutang Street in the former French Concession, which is Xin Yong'an Street, one between Gongguan Ma Road and Minguo Road, which is Lao Yong'an Street.

Tianzhutang Street: one east of Zhu Bao San Road, one west of Puyu West Road in Nanshi.

Da Tong Road: one east of Carter Road, one east of Linyin Road in Nanshi.

Fangxie Road: the one between Xie Bridge and Zhonghua Road is Fangxie Road, the east of which is Fangxie Branch Road, and the south is Fangxie Hou Road.

Caishen Lane: one east of Yanghang Street in the former French Concession, one between Li Ma Road and Guildhall Lane in Nanshi.

### Warning for Chinese Industry: Japanese Woolen Goods Will Be Heavily Sold in the Far East

[Our Newspaper News] Recently, MacArthur's headquarters ordered the Japanese Board of Trade to produce 2.16 million yards of woolen fabrics for export to the Far East market. At the same time, the headquarters' Economic and Scientific Section stated that this woolen fabric will be the first export product made by Japan after the war. This news is nothing less than a warning for China's nascent woolen textile industry and other industries!

China's woolen textile industry has only twenty years of history and has not yet emerged from the stage of nascent industry. In today's situation, neither its technical level nor its raw material supply can compete with advanced countries. A well-placed woolen textile merchant told the reporter: Their machines have been depreciating for nine years, and there is no opportunity to replenish them. What can be bought in Shanghai is second-rate goods, and their efficiency cannot be compared with the latest equipment. But if they order from foreign countries, it will take three years to deliver the goods because of their own needs. Under this unequal technology, coupled with China's unique high wages, can we compete with foreign goods?

Wool Produced in the Northwest Cannot Be Used to Weave High-End Goods

The prospects for the supply of raw materials are similarly discouraging. The wool of the Northwest, because of the neglect of selection, cannot be used to weave high-end woolen fabrics. The reporter personally compared the Northwest wool with Australian imports and could not praise the domestic product. It is said that ten days ago, a key official of the Qinghai Provincial Government was ordered to come to Shanghai to purchase woolen textile machinery because the Qinghai Provincial Government was preparing to use huge capital to establish a modern woolen textile factory. This spirit of construction is worthy of admiration. In the future, the products of this factory may be able to gain a foothold in the Northwest market; but due to human habits and the nature of beauty, it is still insufficient to compete with foreign goods. However, on the other hand, if foreign wool is used as raw material, it will be extremely difficult, which is the main pain of China's woolen textile industry today. Why is it so difficult to obtain world wool? The first is the inevitable phenomenon after the war. Everyone has been tightening their belts during the war, entrusting the plan to "improve the standard of living" to the post-war era. Now that the war has passed like a nightmare, the plan to improve the standard of living needs to be actively implemented.

Britain Has Long Been Monopolizing the International Wool Market

Second, the whole world should thank the British politicians and financiers, who have forged amazing business acumen in the London fog. Long before the war ended, they had already foreseen that there would be a shortage of raw wool after the war. So last year, a wool conference was held in the UK, deciding that the governments of the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and the Union of South Africa would form a large company called the "United Kingdom and Dominion Wool Disposals Ltd." to sell surplus wool around the world. Now this company has been formally organized, and it is presided over by a British person. After the establishment of this organization, wool can no longer flow freely in the international market. Therefore, China's woolen textile industry is reluctantly existing in a state of dependence on others.

MacArthur's Headquarters Supports the Japanese Woolen Textile Industry

The most distressing fact is that the supply of raw wool, one of the five great powers, China, is not even as good as Japan, which is occupied! After Japan was occupied, its woolen textile industry was able to maintain production because the US military supplied it with military goods. At the same time, Japanese merchants have applied to MacArthur's headquarters for approval to import 350,000 bales of wool, one-third of which will be exported abroad after being made into woolen fabrics; the remaining wool will be kept for their own use. In contrast, on the day that the British trade delegation to China arrived in Beijing, our experts had earnestly discussed this issue with their textile representatives, but there were no concrete results. However, it seems that it is already a foregone conclusion that the Japanese woolen textile industry will obtain Australian wool.

The Weak Foundation of the Chinese Woolen Textile Industry Is Lamentable

The prospects for production also do not give us more confidence. Nowadays, due to the regulations of work discipline, the efficiency of general factories is far less than before the war. And China's existing woolen textile spindles are few in number. Taking the China Textile Construction Company as a pillar, it only has 50,000 spindles, and because many are damaged, they are still in the repair stage and the start of work is pending. But as for Japan, it is really worthy of our vigilance. Before the war, there were a total of 1.38 million spindles, and after the war, there were only 480,000 broken spindles left. The reporter learned from authoritative sources that it immediately has 320,000 spindles that can be mobilized. Not only that, but Japan is also preparing to restore its pre-war scale. As for the work ethic of the Japanese? A week ago, a member of the British Labour Party went to Japan to visit at the invitation of MacArthur. After returning to England, he said publicly. The Japanese are magical workers. Their vitality and hard work have not been damaged by the war. If viewed purely from a material point of view, their revival is inevitable.

To Break Through the Environment, Only a Thorough Transformation Is Possible

In this bleak situation, we should seek a way to deal with ourselves. The reporter feels that the only way to go is that China needs to have a long-term overall plan, from the improvement of sheep breeds to the promotion of woolen fabrics. An experienced factory owner told me: The improvement of Chinese sheep breeds will take at least three generations (fifteen years); to have a big effect, it will take twenty years. The cost is of course very large. Only the state can do and is willing to do this kind of long-term large-scale business. The acquisition of new machines also requires state assistance. We cannot wait for three years while others destroy our weak foundation under overwhelming advantage. In the year before the end of the war, two American textile experts were sent to Chongqing to contact the wartime production bureau, wanting to transform China's entire textile industry with American mechanical technology to cope with a possible long-term war. This was a golden opportunity for our country, but the evolution of the situation eliminated it. After the war, talking to the United States about the supply of textile machinery, or the joint establishment of a textile machinery factory in our country by China and the United States, was all yes and no, and no clue could be obtained. This is natural and not surprising. Today, when Japan's industrial power is threatening us again, simply hoping that the Allies will suppress Japan is neither a fundamental solution nor will it be effective. The only way to defend ourselves is to strengthen ourselves and compete; in particular, the Chinese industrial community must have this ambition and spirit.

### Jian Textile Expands Production Capacity: Self-Installation of Generators Can Supply Half of the Required Electricity

Jian Textile Company, in view of the insufficient power supply in the city, which affects the production volume of its affiliated factories, in order to remedy this, specially applied to the Executive Yuan's Materials Supply Bureau for the allocation of four of the latest small turbine generators, which are installed in the company's 19th factory. The installation of machine parts has now begun. Each of these generators can generate 1,000 kilowatts of electricity per day, and they were shipped to Shanghai from the United States and allocated to Jian Textile by President Song. According to the company's recent total number of spindles operating day and night, there are approximately 600,000 spindles, and the electricity required for a full day is more than 8,000 kilowatts. Therefore, after the generators are installed, they can solve more than one-half of the electricity demand.

According to the person in charge of the company, the company's plan to increase production can be divided into three items: (1) Find ways to supply electricity on its own, (2) Collect more cotton, assign personnel to purchase it in various places, and the quota for this year is 800,000 dan (approximately 40,000 metric tons). More than 50,000 dan have already been collected in Hankou, Zhengzhou, Shashi, Nantong, and other places, and large quantities of cotton can also be collected in Tianjin, Shenyang, and the Eastern Salt Reclamation Area, (3) Increase technical personnel to strengthen technical capabilities and improve technical deficiencies. In addition, the company has established a branch company in Shenyang, Northeast China, with considerable production capacity.

### The Problem of High-Interest Loans: Three Causes and Three Solutions

[Our Newspaper's Report] High-interest loans are the greatest obstacle to the development of industry and commerce today. Today, our reporter made a special visit to a certain banker to inquire about the causes and ways to eliminate them. The banker replied: Today, the general lending interest rate of commercial banks is 12.3%, which cannot be said to be too high from the bank's perspective. After all, after the bank receives deposits from the outside world, it must deposit 20% into the Central Bank, reserve a considerable amount as preparation, and then pay interest on deposits. All of these considered, the income is indeed large, but the expenses are also considerable. Tracing the causes of high-interest loans today, firstly, the value of currency is unstable, and the purchasing power of legal tender continues to decline, which relatively leads to the continuous rise in prices, and high-interest loans naturally arise. At the same time, wealthy people in the private sector purchase large amounts of gold and US dollars to preserve the value of currency, resulting in a severe shortage of funds in the market and an increase in interest rates. Secondly, the scope of business of today's banks is much smaller than before the war. For example, foreign exchange trading was originally a type of business, but today it has been controlled. Domestic remittances are still allowed to be operated, but the low exchange rate of national banks makes it fundamentally impossible for commercial banks to compete. As a last resort, they can only concentrate their efforts on operating loans and rely on them as the main source of income. Thirdly, in the past, there was a period when prices continued to rise without any fluctuations, so many merchants borrowed money to hoard goods, which increased interest rates due to supply and demand relationships. At present, bank interest rates, except for industries and businesses with special prosperity, are generally unbearable for long-term burdens. In terms of procedures, for the sake of prudence, unsecured loans have become a thing of the past, and mortgage loans are usually used. As for eliminating high-interest loans, we must start from the root. Generally speaking, there are three methods: (1) Rebuild the monetary system to stabilize its value and restore people's confidence. In this way, a large amount of US dollars and gold will be thrown out, and once there is a lot of money in the market, the market interest rate will naturally fall! (2) The national bank should abandon its tight credit policy, because if industry and commerce cannot obtain low-interest loans from legitimate financial institutions, they can only seek them from the black market at high interest rates. In this way, the black market interest rate will be pulled higher and higher. (3) Bureaucratic capital should be cracked down on, because this type of business with a background occupies a special and superior position, oppressing industrial and commercial businesses without a background, making them maintain themselves by borrowing money, without being able to take into account the height of the interest, which also indirectly promotes one cause of high-interest loans.

### Industrial and Commercial Enterprises Face Crisis, Banks Are No Exception

Yesterday, according to an authoritative figure in the city's financial circles, some people in society believe that industrial and commercial enterprises are facing a crisis, and the main emergency rescue method is to conduct emergency loans and low-interest loans to the banking industry. Little do they know that the financial community is also encountering difficulties. Compared with the total amount of deposits in various banks today, it is about 200 times that of before the war. The assets of various banks before the war were 3 billion, and now they are about 600 billion, while the expenses of various banks have increased 5,600 times compared with before. It is naturally impossible to maintain expenses with a small number of deposits, so abnormal phenomena such as high-interest loans have appeared. Also, because the amount of deposits in each bank is small, the capital must be tight, forming a phenomenon of demand exceeding supply, which is also one of the reasons for creating high interest rates. Therefore, if the industrial and commercial community wants to seek emergency loans or low-interest loans from the financial community, in fact, the banks themselves have insufficient capital and are also encountering difficulties. Some banks are currently convening shareholders' meetings and increasing capital to save their own survival.

Cultural Enterprises

Datong Cultural Enterprise Co., Ltd. is a new cultural production organization with the largest scale. The company operates paper-making, publishing, and the manufacturing and production of stationery. It has also established a paper-making factory in Huqiu Mountain in Suzhou, producing newspapers and writing paper, etc. The company originally planned to print and edit its own books and strive for cultural undertakings thoroughly. However, due to insufficient funds, although the paper-making factory was prepared, it had high-interest loans of more than 600 million yuan. In addition, with the influx of foreign goods, domestic paper was affected. Although it tried hard to struggle, it has been increasingly oppressed by high-interest loans, resulting in inflexible turnover, and has declared liquidation. As for the company's assets, it is said that they can still offset the debts it owes.

Pawnshops

The pawnshop industry in this city is divided into various types, such as pawn, mortgage, and pledge. The interest charged by member pawnshops is relatively low. Other pawnshops charge interest of 35% per month, plus storage box fees. There are also pawnshops (i.e., pledge shops) that charge interest every ten days, with some charging as much as 5%. Therefore, the general poor people currently regard pawnshops as a fearful path. Even if they need to pawn, they would rather sell their clothes once and for all, resulting in a sharp decline in the business of general pawnshops. Yesterday, our reporter spoke with pawnshop personnel, who said that most of the pawnshop funds are taking the opportunity to operate underground money shops, which charge low interest rates, about 25%, but there is no consumption and the transactions are in bulk, unlike the piecemeal procedures of pawnshops. Moreover, some pawnshop owners regard pledging as a sideline. Although the storefront is still open, they actually send people to run around the north and south, doing their own single business. Due to the decline of the pawnshop industry, the used clothing industry has also been affected. Old-fashioned clothes are difficult to sell, and the source of new-fashioned clothes has been cut off. Therefore, recently, the used clothing industry has also changed its style, taking advantage of low labor costs and making new clothes for sale. Some have even changed course and are retailing cotton cloth to maintain their business.

### After the End of World War II, the Demand for Silver Increased Sharply, and the US Silver Production This Year Was Not Very Saw-Toothed.

[Reuters, San Francisco, 2nd] The San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank expects that the shortage of silver will continue to be felt for a considerable period of time in the future. It is said that since the end of the war, the demand for silver has exceeded supply by a large margin. The Treasury Department's circulating silver reserves have decreased from a peak of 1.4 billion ounces in May 1942 to 400.3 million ounces at the end of 1945. World wartime silver production is constantly decreasing. In the first half of 1946, US silver production was only 9 million ounces, while the production in 1941 was 71.1 million ounces, and the production in 1945 was 29 million ounces. In mid-1946, the general need for US white eyes is estimated to be 120 million ounces, while last year's global production was only 160 million ounces. Therefore, the United States alone can consume the silver currently produced worldwide.

[United Press, Washington, 2nd] After the United States raised the purchase price of silver to 91.25 US cents per ounce this summer, 16 silver-producing countries exported to the US market. In August, US silver imports reached 9.3 million ounces, and in July, 8.9 million ounces. This was only 1.2 million ounces in May when it was 71.1 cents per ounce. June was 1.5 million ounces.

### Canada's Gold and Silver Production

[Reuters, Ottawa, 2nd] In August, Canada's total gold production was more than 231,000 ounces, while in July it was 239,500 ounces. Silver production fell from 1,265,821 ounces in July to 1,185,905 ounces.

Cigarette Shops

According to the Cigarette, Soap, Candle and Match Industry Association, since the victory last year, the cigarette shops in this city have been experiencing sluggish business, and several have closed down every day. The reasons for this are nothing more than the pressure of high-interest loans and the impact of heavy government taxes. Moreover, foreign goods are competing for sales, and domestic cigarettes are in a slump. The price of foreign cigarettes is low, and smuggling is rampant. There are vendors all over the streets and alleys, with no expenses or taxes, selling at low prices. Therefore, cigarette shops cannot compete with them. More than 4,000 cigarette shops in the city have successively requested the industry association to appeal to the government for relief. Yesterday, it was reported that the Mei Chang Xie Chang Dao Cigarette Company had also closed down.

### Twenty-Two Enemy and Puppet Factories Put Up for Sale, Industrialists from the Rear Take Advantage of Purchases and Operations

Regarding the auction of enemy and puppet factories and the priority purchase by industrialists from the rear, the Enemy and Puppet Property Processing Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Central Trust Bureau have repeatedly consulted and decided that the purchase will be made by industrialists from the rear. The factories have now been taken over in batches. The original 22 factories were entrusted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to industrialists from the rear as factory directors to prepare for resumption of work. However, the results of the resumption of work were not good. Now, most of them are purchased by the original factory directors, who are actively planning to refresh the system and increase production. It is reported that the current 22 factories have only 1,500 workers. After preliminary reorganization, it is expected to increase to more than 5,000 people. Then, the unemployed workers from the rear who have been unemployed for a long time can all obtain work. The list of factory names and the names of the purchasers of the 22 factories are listed below.

A List of Purchased Factory Names

(1) San Shang Electric Factory (Chen Zugang) (2) Xing Ya Rubber Factory (Yu Yisheng) (3) Zhongshan Steel Industry East and West Factories (Huang Puqi) (4) Tian Qi Shen Steel Factory (Fan Tanyun). Dafeng Machinery Factory (Hu Shuchang) (6) Shanghai Canister Factory (Chen Gengmei) (7) Xing Ya Precision Machinery Factory (Ding Weizhong) (8) Jiangnan Machinery Factory (Yan Yaokan) (9) Japanese Iron Factory (Yuan Weiqing) (10) Xing Ya Steel Industry Factory (Yu Enpei) (11) Minghua First Iron Factory (Shen Dingchen) (12) Linzi Timber Company (Hu Guangshe) (13) Nozawa Asbestos Factory (Yin Zhizhong) (14) Xinhua Electric Appliance Manufacturing Company (Zhou Jinshui) (15) Shanghai Industrial Second Factory (Xia Shushu) (16) Asia Steel Industry Company (Tang Hanzong) (17) Ri Ya Steel Industry Factory (Yu Dongyu) (18) Da Nippon Paint Co., Ltd.

The scope will include English teachers from Nanjing and neighboring provinces and cities.

### Turmoil at Zhonghua University: Students Opposing the President Turns Into a Full-Scale Brawl

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 3rd] The turmoil at Zhonghua University against the president has become increasingly acute. Yesterday, students from the attached high school and university students engaged in a "full-scale brawl," with three seriously injured and more than ten slightly injured. Middle school students and some teachers and professors posted slogans listing ten counts of Wang Yihuan's malfeasance, etc., vowing to drive Wang out of the school. Later, the Education Department sent unarmed police to dissuade them, and the fighting stopped. This afternoon, the school authorities entertained reporters and reported on the incident. It was said that a few lecturers and staff members requested promotions and fought for salaries that were not approved, and the middle school department was controlled by the former president Chen Shi, so it was also related to Chen's instigation.

### China-Siam College Will Not Be Established for the Time Being

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] Li Tiezheng, the ambassador to Siam, previously requested the Chairman to establish a China-Siam College in Siam to train teachers and cultivate cadres to connect the cultures of the two countries and promote cultural exchanges between the two countries. The Chairman has submitted the case to the Ministry of Education for review. Recently, the Ministry of Education has replied that it does not intend to establish a formal college for the time being. If there are institutions or groups studying Chinese academic subjects, the Ministry of Education will provide subsidies.

### Northeastern Education Should Pay Attention to Three Points: Huang Rujin, President of Changchun University, Talks

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 3rd] Huang Rujin, president of Changchun University, came to Beiping from the Northeast and then to Beijing. Huang told reporters today that three points should be paid special attention to in education in the Northeast: First, special attention must be paid to language and writing. In the past, students used "Concord Language," that is, the characters were Chinese characters, but what they talked and wrote was Japanese grammar, and the students' attitude was also extremely humble, so it is urgent to thoroughly correct this. Second, the enemy's technical, industrial, and scientific foundations in the Northeast, and the research on soil, animals, and plants, etc., should be well utilized and continued. The reason why Changchun University established six colleges is actually because Changchun has six universities run by the enemy. Third, the patriotic enthusiasm of Northeastern students needs to be strengthened, that is, history and geography subjects should be taught from scratch. Also, Northeastern students have a very good spirit of autonomy because they have been ruled by the enemy for fifteen years and struggled to survive.

### Wang Zhengting and Yuan Dunli Leave Beiping for Shanghai on the Same Day

### The A-League Football Game Initially Had an Upset: Youyou Defeats the Jewish Team, 2-0, The Dark Horse Suffers Its First Waterloo

In this year's A-League football league, the Jewish team is known as a strong team. Last week, it defeated the Soviet Union 3-1, and the crowd paid attention to it. However, to everyone's surprise, it encountered Waterloo yesterday morning and lost to Youyou 2-0. It can be said to be a major upset and a proud masterpiece of Youyou. Youyou's victory was due to its defense, and the Jewish team could not cross the line. In the second half, Youyou took advantage of the wind and launched a major offensive. Cao Qinfang first scored, followed by a penalty kick, laying the foundation for victory. More than a thousand spectators in Jin Yuan Park were overjoyed.

The Battle Process

He Chunhui was the referee. The Jewish team, with the remaining power of defeating the Soviet Union, and with the help of the Italian general Silati Baojie, and Jack Jacob making a comeback, everyone thought that they could win without a doubt. Unexpectedly, Youyou would be motivated and act, which was unexpected. In the first half, although the Jewish team encountered the wind, it was of no use because of Youyou's strong resistance, and no record was opened. After the break, the battle restarted. Youyou took advantage of the wind and launched a major offensive. The Jewish team tried its best to defend. After holding on for 20 minutes, Cao Qinfang shot, hit the left goal post, bounced off the right goal post and went inside. Youyou broke the record first. After that, the battle situation was in a stalemate. Until the 35th minute, Manya committed a foul and was sentenced to a penalty kick. Cao Qinfang took the knife and scored in one fell swoop, making it 2-0. The Jewish counter-offensive was in vain. When Yuan Kuntian was sent off the field, the game ended hastily, and the troops were withdrawn. Youyou won 2-0, which was a proud work.

### Donghua Overcomes Hequn

The Result Was Four to One in the First Half:

Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 pm, Donghua and Hequn fought in Yiyuan, and 3,000 fans were quite lively. Judge Deng Xiaoliang blew the whistle to start the game. Donghua Ade did not appear, and Huang Kehou served as the center forward. Donghua's offensive was fierce, but because Hequn's luck was smooth, Donghua Teng did not score. Hequn also occasionally had the opportunity to invade Donghua's penalty area, but it was even more difficult to succeed. No record was opened within half an hour. It was not until the 34th minute that Youliang got the ball on the edge, rushed forward quickly, went deep into the hinterland, and immediately hooked it in. Li Yao waited for the right moment, and his left foot rose up and went into the net in response. Two minutes later, Han Longhai dribbled the ball to attack, and Yao Chong abandoned the pass to save, but Longhai had already reached the city, raised his foot and shot obliquely, and sent it into the empty goal. At the same time, he collided with Yao Chong, and both of them fell unconscious. Longhai woke up after a while, but Yao Chong was more seriously injured and had to leave the field, replaced by Min Yuehan. At the end of the first half, Donghua led 2-0.

Second Half: Changing the gate to fight again, Donghua replaced Huang Kehou with Chen Mingzhe, and Longhai changed to center forward. Hequn Tang Genfu rested temporarily, and Fang Mingkang came on the stage. Dong Qun's offensive was still strong, but Chen Mingzhe repeatedly missed opportunities and gained nothing. At 20 minutes, Mingzhe passed the ball wonderfully, and Longhai swept it across, Donghua then broke Hequn's goal three times. Two minutes later, Han Longbi committed a foul, and Zhang Ting took a free kick, shooting from a distance. Hequn pulled back a goal. Soon Liu Longxing headed the ball, just as Chen Mingzhe raised his foot, causing his nose to bleed and was injured and left the field. At 37 minutes, Sun Laojin shot, and Min Yuehan patted it into a corner kick. Youliang opened it, just right, and the "nephew" headed it in. After that, the battle situation became more relaxed, and at the end of the game, Donghua overcame his disciples 4-1.

### Talking About Social Education Issues

— Yang Rubiong

Social education is gradually being forgotten by everyone! If it is not mentioned today, not only the general public, but even people in the education field may have forgotten it. I am wondering: will social education one day be excluded from the realm of education?

This is a major crisis facing social education, and it will inevitably hinder the development of the future of social education! Standing on the position of the nation and the country, standing on the perspective of advancing the entire education system, standing on the position of raising public intelligence, promoting democracy, and realizing constitutional government, shouldn't we raise this issue for discussion?

Social education is a type of educational undertaking, its history as long as society. Where there is society, there is social education, even earlier than the emergence of the school system. Those receiving education in schools are limited to children and youth, while the target of social education includes all people, regardless of gender or age. However, there are too few social education undertakings, and they are not taken seriously enough. Who still knows that social education is important? Who still recognizes the importance of social education undertakings and is willing to promote it? I once heard someone with high-level educational administrative responsibilities publicly say: all public education centers (Minzhong Jiaoyu Guan) across the country should be closed! I don't know what kind of view this is? However, this also proves that not only the general public does not recognize social education, but even people in the education field regard social education as something dispensable! Hearing such words is really infuriating. To develop social education in the future, I feel that the prerequisite is to make everyone have a clearer understanding of social education. In other words: to develop social education, we must start with psychological construction!

Elementary schools, middle schools, and universities have a consistent system and fixed practices. People in the education field consider them to be a matter of course, and the general public can also easily have a clear understanding. However, how should social education be explored? People in charge of education administration always seem to feel that it is not worthy of establishing a system, and they intentionally or unintentionally do not systematize it, forming a complex and chaotic situation, resulting in it being seen as something dispensable. I feel that to change the impression of social education in people's eyes, the most important thing is to systematize and organize it; where should social education institutions be established, and what work should social education institutions do, all must have clear regulations.

The target of social education is so large, the undertaking of social education is so complex, but the funding for social education is pitifully small. Everyone feels that social education can be done or not, so social education funding can naturally be more or less. More is certainly very good, but what does it matter if there is less? In fact, as early as 1929, the central government had already stipulated that "the social education funding of each province and city should account for 10% to 20% of the total education funding"; but how many provinces and cities have reached this standard now?

Education is a kind of relationship between people. The recipient must be willing to learn, and the educator must be good at teaching, so that this educational relationship can achieve the expected good results. Based on this fundamental understanding, we know that whether the teachers are qualified or not has a decisive effect on the quality of education. Elementary schools, middle schools, and universities all need good qualified teachers, which is universally recognized; why can social education be done by just casually finding someone to do it? However, many people's views are indeed like this, and they definitely believe that social education can be done by anyone. Looking at the current situation, there are too few schools in the country that specialize in training social education talents; apart from the National Social Education College and the Jiangsu Provincial Education College, it is impossible to find schools that train senior social education talents. As for schools that train intermediate social education talents, the Ministry of Education originally stipulated that each province and city should establish social education normal schools, but too few have been established. Everyone blames the local public education centers and libraries for not being well-run, and the people running them are not competent. Who can be blamed?

Five. Social Education Teaching Materials and Teaching Aids Issues

The teaching method of "empty talk" is already outdated. To strengthen teaching efficiency, we must try to use books, instruments, specimens, models, and even the latest movies and broadcasts. Each school should compile textbooks, which is a universally recognized and justified fact. However, should social education institutions not compile and print various appropriate teaching materials according to the needs of the public in all aspects of life? The educational administrative authorities are very serious and meticulous in editing and reviewing textbooks for all subjects at all levels of schools, which we approve of; however, we cannot praise the educational administrative authorities for not editing and reviewing various teaching materials needed by the public for social education institutions. With institutions and talents, if there are no teaching materials, or only some random materials are found temporarily, good results will not be achieved, and there is even the danger of errors!

Six. Social Education Achievement Assessment Issues

Whether an elementary school is run well or not can be answered by the performance of its students; whether a middle school or a university is run well or not can also be answered by their students' performance. If the students' performance is good, the general public will say that the school is run well and will support it in various ways. What can be used to show the quality of social education institutions? Everyone says that a certain social education institution is not doing well, because they cannot see the performance of its students. The students of a school are fixed and focused on learning, so it is naturally easy to check its quality; the targets of social education are so complex and unfixed, and they can only spend a small part of their time on education, so the results are naturally difficult to show. Therefore, the issue in the future is to first determine the standards for assessing the performance of social education institutions, and publicize them to the general public, so that everyone knows the standards for evaluating the quality of each social education institution. In this way, the people running them will know the goal of their efforts, and the public will have a fair evaluation. The above six points are my personal "unworthy words" for belly society education, and also my "alarming words" for social education. Readers will perhaps not think they are "alarming words to scare people", right? (October 31, 1946, at the Ministry of Education)

Chairman Chiang in Wuxi. 31st Wuxi News, Gao Wuhong

This news was confirmed by General Tang Enbo on the morning of the 31st and spread like wildfire. As expected, the Chairman's special train arrived at 12:20 amidst the anticipation of the crowd. After stopping, the Chairman, dressed in a solemn blue robe and black formal attire, holding a silver-gray soft hat in his right hand, and wearing black-patterned leather shoes and black silk socks, stepped off the train first. Following him was Madame Chiang, dressed in a royal blue suit, with a graceful and dignified demeanor. Next were Special Envoy Marshall and his wife, the publisher of "Life" magazine, Luce, and more than fifty of the Chairman's staff and attendants, who disembarked one after another. After the group slowly exited the station, the Chairman, amidst the cheers of the crowd, first boarded the "〇〇714" special car with Mrs. Marshall. Madame Chiang and Special Envoy Marshall boarded another blue sedan, and the staff followed in other cars. Led by Chen Daqing in a jeep, they passed through Wuqiao, Huishan, and followed the Xiyi Road straight to Xiaojishan. Along the way, they were warmly cheered by the public. The Chairman smiled in the car, waved his hat, and repeatedly said, "Thank you!"

Five-Hour Stay Stuns the City, Lake Tai Scenery Adds Infinite Glory

Chairman Chiang's sixtieth birthday is being celebrated throughout the world, with great celebrations held across the country to repay the Chairman's great achievements. On this day, the Chairman avoided the birthday celebrations and came to Wuxi to get half a day of rest and enjoy the scenic beauty of the lake and mountains that he had not seen for ten years, so that his birthday would be more peaceful and meaningful, occupying a beautiful and bright page in his glorious life history.

The Wuxi Command of the Jinghu Garrison Headquarters ordered the Wuxi County Government on October 30 to clean the streets, repair the roads, and tidy up the city. After receiving the order, the County Government immediately instructed the district chiefs of the urban area to work with the Military Police Bureau to thoroughly clean all streets and areas inside and outside the city and the train station, to be completed before dusk on the same day. At the same time, 600 civilian laborers were mobilized to repair the badly damaged lakeside avenue, starting in the morning. The paratrooper unit stationed in Wuxi also dispatched personnel to assist, to be completed that night. The military police were responsible for cracking down on street vendors, which was very tense and strict. On the morning of the same day, two planes landed successively at the newly built Wuxi Airport. The first one was unknown, and the second one was General Tang Enbo. From these signs, everyone speculated that the Chairman might come to Wuxi to celebrate his sixtieth birthday. The reporters had no intention of sitting in the editorial office writing稿 and went out to interview all night, but all parties kept their mouths shut and refused to reveal any information.

The "Pingxiang" Pleasure Boat Heads to Yuantouzhu

At 12:50, they arrived at Xiaojishan. The Chairman, arm in arm with Mrs. Marshall, and Special Envoy Marshall, arm in arm with Madame Chiang, disembarked and boarded the "Pingxiang" pleasure boat pre-docked by the lake. The Chairman sat briefly on the bow of the boat, then went ashore alone and stood on the shore, gazing at the distant scenery for a moment to broaden his mind, before slowly boarding the boat, and the boatmen untied the ropes and headed straight for Lake Tai.

When the Chairman's boat headed towards Yuantouzhu, it was surrounded by boats carrying staff on the left, right, and behind. Security was tight, and boats were prohibited from passing through. The "Minghu" gunboat patrolled back and forth on the lake in a semicircle. All the drivers and carriage drivers wore red ribbons on their chests for identification, which was considered thoughtful.

The front cabin of the "Pingxiang" pleasure boat had a long dining table, with a bouquet of red chrysanthemums in a white vase in the center. The windows were decorated with blue silk curtains, which complemented the white tablecloth. Ten minutes after the boat set sail, a lunch was set up in the cabin. All the dishes were prepared by Yingbinlou, and the menu was: assorted cold dishes, stir-fried large meat, braised winter bamboo shoots, winter mushrooms and bamboo shoots with tofu, squirrel mandarin fish, braised chicken cubes, chicken oil greens, crab roe shark fin, crispy whole duck, rose longevity peach, Yifu longevity noodles, hot pot (including four meat and four vegetable dishes, chicken, raw eggs, raw kidney slices, tofu, Chinese cabbage, vermicelli, spinach). The Chairman expressed his appreciation, and after the meal, he smiled and comfortably gazed at the blue waves and distant mountains, and said to his wife and the Marshalls, "To eat fish and crabs, you have to come to Wuxi."

A Short Rest at the Seventy-Two Peak Mountain Hall, Overlooking Lake Tai

During the meal, the Chairman frequently toasted with the guests. The Marshalls also repeatedly stood up to congratulate the Chairman and his wife. According to those close to the Chairman, the Chairman had not had such a hearty drink in several years. At about 2 o'clock, the guests were all slightly drunk and had Taiwan watermelon. The Chairman was very satisfied with the longevity cake presented by Tang Enbo and placed it on the dining table in the cabin. After Madame Chiang lit the sixteen longevity candles, the Chairman personally blew them all out in one breath, wishing longevity without end.

At 2:30, the boat arrived at Yuantouzhu. The Chairman and Mrs. Marshall took the lead, and the entire group disembarked and went ashore. Tourists stood respectfully on both sides of the road to welcome them. The Chairman warmly nodded in reply and climbed the steps with the guests to the Seventy-Two Peak Mountain Hall. Facing the lake and mountains, they sat for a short rest, drinking tea and overlooking Lake Tai, taking in the panoramic view. The Chairman smiled and asked Special Envoy Marshall, "How is the scenery here?" "Wherever I have been with your Excellency, the scenery is beautiful." This was Marshall's reply.

After lingering on the mountain for about thirty minutes, they went down the mountain together. The Chairman was very happy and said to General Tang Enbo, "The scenery of Yuantouzhu is better than that of the West Lake!" Yes, this newspaper's dispatch also made a brief comparison between the West Lake and Lake Tai: "One is a gentle girl, and the other is a handsome hero." (See page 7 of this newspaper on June 2) After being evaluated by the Chairman, it is even more valuable tenfold. At the edge of Yuantouzhu, they sat on the ground, listening to the lake water hitting the rocks, and all worldly thoughts were washed away. The Chairman repeatedly inquired about the people's livelihood, aquatic products, and transportation problems of Lake Tai. Mrs. Marshall liked the maple leaves in the mountains and instructed her attendants to take a large amount back as a souvenir.

The Chairman's group said goodbye to Yuantouzhu at 4:15. At that time, the Wuxi Small Education Association was having a dinner at Yuantouzhu. After hearing the news, they led the elementary school students to line up and send them off respectfully, shouting, "Long live Chairman Chiang!" The Chairman repeatedly nodded and waved his left hand. After getting into the car, they exited Hengyun Park, entered the west gate along the Huanhu Avenue, passed through Fuxing Road, Gongyuan Road, and Yuantong Road, and exited Guangfu Gate to inspect the entire city of Wuxi for a week. Along the way, the people lined the streets to welcome them, and the sound of firecrackers and cheers resounded through the clouds. The atmosphere was enthusiastic and unprecedented, showing the depth of the people's respect and love for the Chairman. When they arrived at the station, a silver single-winged plane circled overhead, distributing leaflets congratulating the Chairman on his birthday. The people scrambled to grab and read them.

The Chairman's special train started at 5:30 amidst the cheers of the people. The cheers were thunderous. The Chairman stood up from the car and waved his hand at the car door, smiling and repeatedly saying, "Good, good, good! Thank you!" The crowd shouted again, "Long live Chairman!" and watched the special train gradually disappear into the twilight.

Note: This is the third time Chairman Chiang has visited Wuxi. The first time was after the completion of the Northern Expedition in 1929, and the second time was in 1936. All three times were with his wife. Every time Chairman Chiang comes to Wuxi, the times and environment have undergone tremendous changes. These three visits to Wuxi have divided three different periods in Chinese history, which also represent three stages of the Chairman's struggle.

The Concession Recently Formally Recovered - A Sketch of Shameen, Guangzhou

October 29, Guangzhou Air Mail, Special Correspondent Liang Feng of this newspaper

Just at the end of this October, the Guangzhou City authorities issued a public announcement that the only concession in Guangzhou, Shameen, has been formally recovered. This news has greatly excited the people of Guangzhou, because although Shameen is not a large place, it was designated as a British and French concession in the late Qing Dynasty (1859 AD) due to unequal treaties. Later, our government spent more than twenty years working to abolish the unequal treaties. Today, with the consent of our friendly countries, under the treaty that abolished extraterritorial rights and other privileges in China, the jurisdiction of this place has been returned to our hands. How can this not excite us? And this small piece of land naturally has its historical value.

The Most Beautiful Corner

If we are coming to Guangzhou by waterway, when we reach the edge of the Guangzhou city area, we will first find a small island with dense shade and elegant scenery in the southwest corner. This is the most beautiful corner of Guangzhou - Shameen. This place has a total area of fifty-five acres and four square li, floating on the Pearl River. A small tributary of the Pearl River separates it from the city area, and it is connected to the city area by two bridges, east and west. Since the place was designated as a British and French concession eighty years ago (of which the British occupied forty-six acres and the French occupied nine acres), the British and French people used the natural environment of being surrounded by water, plus artificial construction, to make it a beautiful place. In this area, there are all magnificent and exquisite foreign houses. The embankment around the island is full of towering ancient trees, which are contrasted by stretches of green lawns, enhancing the elegant atmosphere of this area. Whenever it is morning or dusk, strolling along the embankment and looking at the sails of the Pearl River going up and down is even more enjoyable. Therefore, Shameen is indeed an ideal park.

Since the environment there is beautiful and it is a concession, it has always been a place where foreigners gather. Consulates of various countries stationed in Guangdong are located there, and the rest are foreign firms and shops. Although it is a Chinese territory, there are not only no Chinese residences inside, but even if Chinese people want to enter, they cannot pass without being questioned several times by the red-turbaned guards guarding the bridgehead. This small river, less than four zhang wide, separates Guangzhou and Shameen into two worlds. Guangzhou citizens can only look across the river and imagine the mystery hidden inside Shameen. I am afraid that many people who have lived in Guangzhou for a lifetime have never been to Shameen! Therefore, for decades, Shameen has been called a "special zone" or a "forbidden zone" area, which is not an exaggeration at all.

No Longer a Special Zone

It was because of this "special zone" that Guangzhou had the "June 23" massacre in 1925. Because in May of that year, Shanghai citizens protested against the Japanese纱厂 shooting Gu Zhenghong, and the parade and demonstration were shot and killed by the concession police, resulting in the "May 30" massacre. When the news reached Guangzhou, the citizens were extremely indignant, so on June 23 of the same year, all middle and elementary school students and community members in the city demonstrated and paraded. When they passed through Sha-Er (沙而, a place name) on the opposite bank of Shameen, they were shot by machine guns by the British and French garrison stationed in Shameen. Blood and flesh flew everywhere, and corpses were strewn about, making a remote and long Sha-Er stained with blood. The tragic scene was unbearable to witness. At that time, I, the reporter, also participated in the ranks, so the impression was particularly profound. Later, in order to commemorate the citizens who died in this disaster, the municipal government changed Sha-Er to "June 23rd" Road, and erected a stone tablet at the north end of the West Bridge connecting Shameen and Sha-Er, with the four characters "Never Forget This Day" inscribed on it. This stone tablet still stands there for people to pay their respects. The Dao incident is now just a historical relic!

The current Shameen is certainly no longer a "special zone" or a "forbidden zone"! Since the Japanese army surrendered, Shameen has been taken back by our government along with other recovered areas, directly from the hands of the enemy and puppets. When I, the reporter, returned to Guangzhou after the restoration, the first thing I felt was different from before was the establishment of the Shameen Branch of the Guangzhou City Police Bureau. At the same time, standing at the east and west bridges were no longer red-turbaned people wearing "crowns," but our police officers wearing Qing Tian Bai Ri (Blue Sky with a White Sun) cap badges. Naturally, there are fewer "foreign flavors" in the Shameen area, but its scenery remains the same, and everything remains the same. There is the splendid and magnificent Victory Building, which houses restaurants, hotels, and dance halls, which is the most ideal place for high-ranking officials and dignitaries to entertain distinguished guests. There is also the Recreation Club run by the provincial government, which also has dining rooms, ballrooms, and swimming pools. The municipal government's tennis court and the Youth League's youth swimming pool are also there. When the New First Army was stationed in Guangdong last year, Sun Liren's headquarters was also located in Shameen. Currently, the important agencies there are: the South China Naval Headquarters, the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau, the "United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" office, the "Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" Guangdong Branch, the "China Electric Corporation" and the "China Manufacturing Corporation" offices, etc. In addition, there are the consulates of the United States, Britain, France, Portugal, Denmark, Switzerland, Norway, and other countries stationed in Guangdong, and some foreign firms that have returned to resume business. The rest of the magnificent foreign houses have been occupied by the mansions of our high-ranking officials and dignitaries. According to statistics from the Shameen Police Branch, there are more than two hundred households in the Shameen area, with a total population of more than three thousand, of which only four or five hundred are foreigners.

Indeed, the recovery of Shameen is enough to excite us. There are no more concessions in the country! What remains are probably only Hong Kong, Kowloon, and Macau! We hope that in the near future, we will be able to receive even more exciting news, which is that our friendly countries can respect each other's friendship and return the sovereignty of these remaining places to us. This is probably not an extravagant hope!

Weekly Forum: Promoting Our Country's Peaceful Education! Zhou Shang

After the Paris Peace Conference closed, the United Nations General Assembly will be held, and the Second United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Conference will also open in Paris. According to reports, our country's representatives decided to depart at the beginning of this month. We hope that this international cultural and educational conference can truly lay the foundation for world peace. As the organization's charter declaration says, "Peace based solely on intergovernmental political and economic consultations cannot achieve the consistent, permanent, and sincere maintenance of all the people of the world." They have realized that the power of education and culture is not enough to lay the foundation for true world peace. Our country has a magic weapon to achieve permanent world peace. As long as this magic weapon is thoroughly understood by all mankind, the world will not be difficult to achieve great harmony, and it will not be difficult to achieve peace. It is hoped that this time our country's representatives can realize this preliminary mission.

Human wars originate from conflicts of ideas. This war was a conflict between democratic ideology and fascist ideology. The united democratic countries have won victory, and the ideal of world peace has just opened the first page. Even though we have charter declarations and other peace guarantees, we must see if various international conferences can succeed in whether the ideals revealed during the war can be implemented after the war.

The aggression of the fascists has solidified into grasping at the moon in the water, but the construction of a beautiful and happy peaceful world should be as much effort as the pursuit of war victory. There has been enough bloodshed this time, and the next generation should not be allowed to bleed a second time. Let this war be the last war of mankind! The Treaty of Versailles is a lesson from the past. At that time, Germany after defeat was like a pitiful insect with its limbs cut off, but national education was completely free. Germany, with its empty national power, invested heavily in national education. Unfortunately, the education they invested in was the implementation of Nietzsche's superman violent ideology education, which eventually created human vexation and mutual slaughter, turning the civilized crystallization of human efforts into cannon fodder.

Why is the power of education so great? Because education is to cultivate thought, and thought is the precursor of behavior, and it can also be said that thought is behavior. We pray for a peaceful world, and we should first use education to cultivate human peaceful thought. "Cows drink water to become milk, and snakes drink water to become poison." Education is like water. If used properly, it becomes a tonic. If used improperly, it becomes a toxin. Hegemonic countries use education as a tool of aggression, while Wangdao (benevolent rule) countries use education as a sharp tool to sow the seeds of peace. In order to realize permanent world peace, we should promote world peace through peace education. Germany and Japan are already undergoing re-education, and their spirit should be able to be disarmed. The impeccable style of the United Nations itself is the highest and most effective spirit of re-education.

War is a metabolic whip that whips politicians to change, educators to change, education to change, and the world to change. President Truman talked about the importance of international cultural and educational organizations at the White House on September 25, and said, "If our country does not have understanding, we will have no peace; if we do not have education, we will have no peace." Professor Dai Lao of the Illinois Institute of Technology in the United States suggested that the old site of the League of Nations be changed to a world university as a basis for transforming psychology and maintaining peace. In mid-September, a world education organization was established in New York's Andico City, with representatives from 25 countries representing millions of teachers. Most of the two-house meeting was spent discussing how to promote international peace through education. The "International Conference on New Education Research" held in Australia also focused on future world peace.

In the past, world education, except for China, did not escape three factions: (1) Democratic education, (2) Fascist education, (3) Socialist education. The first type falls into individual pragmatism, the second type is dialectical idealism, and the third type is dialectical materialism. Each has its own shortcomings, which created a world of utilitarian aggression and struggle. Only the Three People's Principles of Education is truly democratic education and can create true world peace. It contains the comprehensive nature of the educational philosophy of the three schools of democracy, fascism, and socialism. It has a selective function, promoting its strengths and discarding its weaknesses. The Principle of People's Livelihood is socialism, which is Datongism (the Great Unity), and nationalism is national ideology, not statism. The Principle of People's Rights opposes Locke and Rousseau's "natural rights" and demands true equality.

The Three People's Principles of Education is a continuation of Chinese traditional education. However, Wangdao education is peaceful education, which is Zhishan (Utmost Good) education. The whole world should adopt the spirit of Chinese education, and the world can only be permanently peaceful. The spirit of Chinese traditional education is "emphasis on morality." With the rise of the Han Dynasty, emphasis on morality became a definite education policy. Confucius' cultivation of self, family, governance of the country, and pacification of the world are all consistent. Lao Tzu also said, "Cultivate it in yourself, and its virtue is true; cultivate it in your family, and its virtue is surplus; cultivate it in your village, and its virtue is long; cultivate it in your state, and its virtue is abundant; cultivate it in the world, and its virtue is good." They all proposed "taking the world as a family and China as one person."

Confucius spoke of benevolence, and Lao Tzu spoke of compassion, and the Chinese family can be called a "benevolence and compassion cultivation field," which is lacking in Westerners. Westerners go from nature to man, while Chinese go from man to nature. The West focuses on conquering nature, and the object is power, and social life is struggle. China focuses on regulating life, and the object is vitality, and social life is the coexistence of all things. In the West, material development is already developed, but human relations are still imperfect. In China, although material life is poor, human relations still feel harmonious. These are all the results of traditional education, and this kind of education is our magic weapon.

The purpose of the Three People's Principles of Education is actually equivalent to the outline of "The Way of Great Learning...rests in resting in the Utmost Good" mentioned in the Great Learning. Mental and material, both are taken care of, things and I are equally important, not only for the present, but also for the future, individuals have freedom, groups have freedom, for others and for oneself, without erasing the nation-state, while advocating world Datong (Great Unity). If this kind of Zhishan (Utmost Good) education, which is "applicable to the four seas," is promoted to the world, why worry that the world will not have permanent peace?

China has been called the land of etiquette and righteousness since ancient times. Individuals value no contention, and politics also value moral transformation. The prosperity of ritual music and the beauty of yielding are originally internal affairs. A government that yields virtue will definitely be anti-aggressive and uphold peace in its foreign policy. The Yao Dian of the Book of Documents says "harmonize all nations," and Gu Ming says "harmonize the world." Ancient guest rituals were full of a solemn and peaceful atmosphere. This is the manifestation of whether the country is educated.

Two months ago, the New York Times Magazine published an article by Boli Tuo, who is familiar with Chinese culture and education, entitled "World Peace and Chinese Philosophy." He believed that Chinese social and political philosophy is based on obligations rather than rights. He also said that independent countries must recognize their obligations to other countries and regard themselves as members of the entire family in order to get along well; countries with strong power must understand that they have the responsibility to use this power to promote the welfare of mankind in order to prevent aggression. He recognizes that this ideal can be found in Chinese philosophy, because Chinese philosophy is all about studying how humans can get along well. He also said that Confucius' ideal world is beautiful, and only by cultivating a sense of responsibility and applying it to the international aspect can a truly international society be realized.

People have already seen our magic weapon for maintaining world peace. We hope that the representatives this time should bring a set of great Chinese principles to translate into various languages and widely publicize, especially the theoretical system of the Three People's Principles of Education. We must make a good effort to report to the world and make them accept and welcome our culture and education as the yeast of peace. We must also propose the organization of international education organizations as the center of the world security mechanism, implement China's Wangdao (benevolent rule) peaceful education, in order to seek world peace.

Random Notes on the Paris Peace Conference

The Film is 30,000 Meters Long, and the Daily Paper Consumption is 150 Tons

October 20 Air Mail, Hong Fu Sent from Paris

The Second Paris Peace Conference began on July 27, 1946, and ended on October 15 of the same year. The grand occasion was unprecedented, as can be seen from the statistical figures:

(1) Expenses: The total expenditure was 136 trillion and 25 million francs, which is equivalent to about 3,725 trillion Chinese currency, all borne by the French government alone.

(2) Consumption: The conference had 158 vehicles. The monthly consumption of gasoline was about 125,000 liters. The five countries of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, France, and China had the most vehicles, all reaching six.

There were 20 microc-phones placed next to the speakers' seats to transmit and record the 47 conferences, 114 committees, and 36 interviews. Either transmit and record, or record first and then transmit, or send to London by telephone first, and then send by shortwave electricity from them. A total of 428 hours were used for wireless work.

(D) Photography. Each country could enter the venue for photography and projection with a quota of 20 journalists, with the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France each occupying four places, and the remaining 17 countries sharing the rest.

Problem Studies

### The Development of China's Textile Industry

— Deng Qiu Shao

The textile industry occupies the most important position in China's industries, employing over 200,000 workers and involving over 30 billion in capital. Before the war, the nation relied on it for over 50 million yuan in taxes. Therefore, the textile industry is related to the rise and fall of the entire national economy and is also a pioneer in the modernization of Chinese industry. Regarding this important industry, we hope to understand the path the Chinese textile industry should take in the future by reviewing past situations.

The establishment of textile factories in China began with Li Hongzhang's establishment of the Shanghai Foreign Cloth Bureau. After this, textile factories continued to be established. However, after the Opium War and the Sino-Japanese War, foreign merchants obtained the right to establish factories in treaty ports, resulting in a sudden increase in foreign-owned yarn factories in China. By the 34th year of the Guangxu reign, although there were 52 yarn factories in China, Japanese merchants owned 8 of them, British merchants 6, German merchants 2, and Sino-foreign joint ventures 2. It was not until the outbreak of the European War in August of the 3rd year of the Republic of China that the foundation for this national industry was laid. During the war, countries were focused on their own survival and had no time to attend to the development of industry and commerce. Even the United Kingdom, which held the reins of the textile industry, also tried to reduce workers, resulting in a lack of production and a sharp decrease in exports. As a result, the market price of textiles rose day by day. Therefore, at that time, Chinese textile factories were all extremely profitable, accumulating thick profits. Those with assets also saw the potential for profit and invested in the textile industry, resulting in a sudden emergence of new factories like bamboo shoots after rain, creating a new situation in China's textile industry. By the end of the 11th year of the Republic of China, the total number of spindles in the country had increased dramatically from 590,000 to 2 million, and the number of textile factories had increased by 17. This was the most remarkable page in Chinese industrial history.

After the 12th year of the Republic of China, there was no special development in China's textile industry. At that time, politics were not on the right track, warlords were dividing the country, and there were years of civil war without construction. Transportation was inconvenient, and many factories were reorganized or closed due to poor business. However, many new factories were added during this period. However, due to the above reasons, the textile industry could not be fully developed.

Until the September 18th Incident in the 20th year of the Republic of China, Japan invaded the three northeastern provinces by force. The following year, the January 28th War occurred in Shanghai (Note 1), China's Lancashire. These two wars gave the Chinese people the most painful scars and at the same time gave the textile industry the most severe blow. At that time, factories destroyed by the war and forced to shut down accounted for one-fifth of the country, and the losses suffered could not be recovered in a short period of time. Moreover, after the three northeastern provinces were occupied by Japanese forces, our country's textile exports to the Northeast (accounting for over 31% of the country) gradually decreased to complete cessation of sales. In order to expand its political power, Japan strengthened its control over the North China market. Japanese merchants disregarded costs and competed by lowering prices, making it even more difficult for Chinese merchants, and sales shortened.

The decrease in sales and the drop in yarn prices almost brought our textile industry to complete defeat. Although the factories struggled repeatedly, reducing workers, cutting salaries, and increasing workloads, the results were still difficult to maintain. By June of the 23rd year, according to statistics from the National Textile Industry Federation, as many as 12 textile factories across the country had completely shut down. In addition, although the factories tried to maintain the status quo, they all reduced their business scope.

The prosperity of a country's industry and commerce is closely related to politics. In the 25th year of the Republic of China, China's national power was still immersed in a hot and deteriorating state, and domestic enterprises also faced an unprecedented crisis. Therefore, the textile industry still could not escape the unfortunate fate of recession. However, there was still a very special phenomenon in the Chinese textile industry during this period of decline, that is, from the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the number of yarn spindles in the country increased year by year. However, according to the working conditions, the increase in shutdowns and salary reductions was enough to show that the increase in the number of spindles was an abnormal phenomenon.

Until the second half of the 25th year of the Republic of China, the implementation of the legal currency policy and the domestic transportation were more developed than before, and because of the rural economic recovery, the people's purchasing power increased, the textile industry suddenly picked up. Sales of textiles were so strong that the factory inventory sold out. Although the factories opened day and night, there was still a situation of supply exceeding demand, and yarn prices soared, and the factories earned huge profits. Therefore, the factories that had previously shut down and closed seized the opportunity to resume work in succession, and the planned new factories and yarn factories expanded the yarn spindles. It is estimated that in the six months of that year, the number of new yarn spindles reached more than 150,000, which was another golden age for the textile industry.

However, not long after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the textile industry fell into a critical state again. Moreover, between the first half of the 26th year, what is worth mentioning is that the textile industry in Tianjin and Qingdao almost fell into the hands of the Japanese, and the money spindles accounted for 70% of the land. Therefore, Chinese merchants were precarious, while Japanese merchants were booming.

During the war, the textile factories suffered heavy losses. Later, after the occupied areas were forced to buy cotton cloth by the enemy and puppets, the factories almost completely stopped working and closed down. The factories that moved back to the inland were also unable to maintain full operation due to the isolation of transportation and the inconvenience of raw material transportation. However, after the victory, the enemy and puppet textile factories were taken over by our country. The Japanese economy in China for more than 30 years was changed to national management, which is truly an unprecedented event in the history of China's textile industry. Moreover, due to the general lack of domestic textiles after the war, and the high price of yarn and low price of cotton, the textile factories were actively seeking to revive. Therefore, the resumption of work in the textile industry in various places was relatively rapid. By the end of June this year, the average rate of resuming work had reached 60-80%. However, after the foreign exchange adjustment last month, the market price of textile raw materials rose sharply, the wages of workers increased endlessly, and the burden of interest became heavier. The degree of recovery of the Japanese textile industry surpassed our country. If this continues, it is difficult to predict whether the textile industry will remain unchanged for a long time.

The above is a brief overview of the development of China's textile industry in the past 35 years. In this, we can also see a clue to the development of the textile industry in the past. However, the author's knowledge is shallow, and there are many omissions, and the errors in understanding are inevitable. I hope that celebrities in this field will teach me.

### Improving China's Silk Industry

— Cai Yaochun

Silk originated in our country and is a major agricultural byproduct and a major commodity for foreign trade. The production areas are all over the country, and the profits benefit the people. Its prosperity and decline are also sufficient to influence the prosperity and decline of our national economy. However, the people of our country have always valued conservatism, so that for thousands of years, there has been no improvement in breeding and reeling. They have remained stagnant and have been overtaken by countries such as England and Italy. In order to regain rights and revive the silk industry and compete with European and American countries, reform must be carried out. I will now describe the opinions I have learned as follows, and I hope that experts will give me some advice:

A. Production Technology

A. Instilling knowledge of silkworm breeding, seed selection, and mulberry cultivation to farmers.

The work of popularizing education cannot be completed in a short period of time, and improving the silk industry is an urgent matter. In order to achieve the above-mentioned objectives at the current stage, it is necessary to temporarily adopt indirect methods, that is, the government should establish silkworm and mulberry guidance centers in silk producing areas, actively send personnel to guide farmers in scientific methods of silkworm breeding, and conduct chemical tests and statistics at any time to strictly crack down on inferior species. For mulberry cultivation, we should teach them how to fertilize, how to rotate pruning, and how to prevent pests, so that the quality of mulberry can be improved, and the quality of silk will naturally be improved accordingly.

B. Replenishing Silk Factory Capital

This kind of cause containing national characteristics is best state-owned, otherwise the silk factory must be adequately capitalized. Silk factories with sufficient capital can pay attention to the improvement of reeling and technology, such as employing professional talents and purchasing new machines. The method is that the government should conduct registration and stipulate the minimum capital amount of silk factories. Those with insufficient capital are not allowed to start work. The government purchases its assets at a fair price, improves them, and then operates them with state funds. In this way, the drawbacks of rough manufacturing can be eliminated, and the revival of the silk industry can be expected.

C. Specialized Talents Should be Cultivated in Large Quantities

The government should establish specialized schools in various places, hire professors with extensive knowledge and rich experience, engage in training specialized talents, instill specialized knowledge, and provide more opportunities for practice. Afterwards, the reasons for the failure of the Chinese silk industry over the years and the methods of improvement should be carefully studied, so that students can make contributions to the country after graduation, otherwise they will only become tools for capitalists to exploit workers.

B. Production Organization

A. The Government Should Implement Control

In recent years, the industries of various countries in the world have been controlled and subsidized by the government. The prosperity and decline of industry is related to the foundation of a country. How can it be allowed to rise and fall? China's industry is immature. To compete with European and American countries, the government should provide full protection and control. How can the lessons of the past be ignored? Therefore, in the future, the government should set up institutions in various production areas to control the price of silkworm cocoons and the collection of cocoons, and then sell them to silk factories at a fair price. The internal affairs of silk factories should also be supervised and guided by government agencies. The products must be strictly inspected and divided into grades, and the prices of each grade must be uniform. If this can be done, the production situation in various parts of the country will gradually become regularized, and the authorities will easily detect various shortcomings and gradually improve them.

B. Establishment of Direct Sales Agency

In order to avoid the exploitation of profits by indirect sales merchants, general agencies should be set up in major ports in the country to register the products, types, and inventory of each factory. On the one hand, branch agencies should be set up in various silk sales countries to investigate the silk sales situation, and to be familiar with the supply situation of the silk market in various countries, and achieve the effect of "knowing yourself and your enemy, you will never be defeated."

C. Financial Institutions Should Cooperate Closely with Farmers and Silk Merchants

In recent years, the world economy has been extremely empty, and the United States and other countries have taken the opportunity to invade China. Under the dual pressure, the Chinese countryside is on the verge of bankruptcy, and farmers are extremely poor. Where do they get the capital to breed silkworms in large quantities? Therefore, in recent years, China's silk production has increased sharply, and various silk factories have also failed year after year. The capital is stretched, and they have failed to produce in large quantities. The financial community in our country should provide practical assistance to this kind of difficulty. During the spring and autumn silkworm flooding, low-interest loans should be provided to farmers, using the produced silkworm cocoons as collateral. Although the time is only one month, the farmers will benefit greatly. On the one hand, when silk is selling well, financial institutions provide large amounts of loans to silk factories so that they can actively produce and avoid missing the opportunity.

The above-mentioned points are all urgent matters. If we work hard in time and improve step by step, it will not be difficult for the Chinese silk industry, which has long been at the top of the world, to once again dominate the world.

### Waiting

— Ying

In the management of industry, waiting is a very important element of success. The waiting mentioned here is not shrinking back and waiting for time, but working hard and moving forward on weekdays, and when the opportunity comes, seize the opportunity and do not give up easily.

When the environment is unfavorable, you should wait, waiting for the environment to improve.

But being able to wait is not easy, it must have a sustaining power, this sustaining power, financial support, etc. are very important, but can be produced by the perseverance of not being afraid of difficulties.

### Introduction to Business Administration

— Xu Baiyi

Employee Psychology

Foreword

In the operation of an enterprise, most people think that the most difficult thing to solve is personnel problems. Many good businesses have opinions due to personnel problems, making it impossible to proceed, and even going on the path of ending or dissolving.

This kind of situation often refers to the personnel problems between senior staff. In places where labor is employed, then the problems of labor are also very difficult to solve.

Many people do not know what is called scientific management and what is the difference between scientific management and business administration. This can be simply explained. The so-called scientific management is that the implementation of business administration must be done according to scientific methods. For example, dealing with daily affairs has always been done verbally without records, which is unscientific. According to the principles of scientific management, there should be records.

But this is scientific management in a narrow sense. The great goal of scientific management is to achieve the maximum production and the highest profit with the least amount of expenses and labor. After the January 28th Shanghai War, the printing factory and translation bureau of the Commercial Press were destroyed by artillery fire. At that time, it was a very difficult period, but Mr. Wang Yunwu, the general manager of the library, used twelve hours of work every day to do his best to plan the progress of various affairs. Therefore, in less than a year, the production power was several times higher than before January 28th. This is the result of using scientific management methods. He values time very much. Therefore, he said that it only takes five minutes for a person to eat. Many of his subordinates ridiculed him that this was impossible. In fact, although this is a very simple example, it can be used in the handling of affairs. If a person can handle affairs perfectly, that is the first step. The second step is to reduce the time required. If what originally took ten minutes can be done in five minutes, then can't many more things be done in a day? Therefore, scientific management has a great principle, that is, to reduce all unnecessary waste.

Scientific management also has a prerequisite, that is, on the one hand, it must generate extremely abundant profits, and on the other hand, it must also promote the welfare of workers, because a business cannot prosper sustainably if it only thinks from the perspective of the capitalists. It is necessary to improve the lives of workers, so that they can work stably, so that they can have a healthy body and a healthy mind, and produce excellent work.

In many great factories abroad, a town has been built, and the workers all live in it. Their lives are very stable, and they also use methods such as consumer cooperatives to enjoy lower prices for their daily necessities because of group purchases. They have public canteens, even sports grounds, cinemas, compulsory schools, and libraries, so that all workers can live and work in peace and contentment, and are unwilling and do not need to leave that lovely town to seek entertainment outside. They live in this environment, naturally, can create a good atmosphere. In this case, career and family can truly be said to be united.

However, in China, because the production industry has not developed to a considerable time, it is not yet possible to achieve that level of perfection, but if there are talents in business administration and the methods of business administration are studied (we temporarily call it business administration, and do not bring up the big hat of scientific management, because we still focus on reality), progress is not a problem.

In the past, when operating an enterprise, I only knew to buy raw materials at the lowest price, engage in production, sell at a corresponding price and obtain a corresponding profit, and did not pay much attention to the problems of labor.

But the times are progressing, so more attention should be paid to labor problems than before, so employing labor requires the use of the principles of psychology. The purpose of this work is to know whether the psychology of the labor side is healthy and whether it can meet the needs of the work.

In the past, there was no testing when employing labor, so there was often an uneven phenomenon. If testing is carried out and then training is given, then the working level of workers can be standardized, which has a great relationship with the progress of work and production. At the same time, this method is not only suitable for labor, even for staff, it can also be applied, so we can collectively call it employee psychology.

### Amino Acid Mixture

— Wen

It is now well known that vitamins are essential nutrients for everyone every day, but there are some substances in the human body that cannot be produced internally and must be digested and then entered into the body. Amino acids (Amino Acid) are one of these precious substances.

According to medical research, there are more than 20 kinds of amino acids, but there are 10 main ones. These 10 kinds of amino acids cannot be missing one. If an appropriate amount of vitamins and minerals are added, it can become the most nourishing type of supplement.

### A Desolate Conversation About West Lake in Late Autumn

— Zhao Qingge

Traveling is inherently a joyful thing, and I, in my life, love traveling the most. But this time, I feel no joy at all. For many days, the atmosphere from all sides has been so oppressive that it suffocates me. Carrying a heavy heart, I reluctantly accompanied a few friends to Hangzhou. Although this is a scenic area of ​​green mountains and clear waters, my mood has not eased in the slightest because of it. When I threw myself into the embrace of West Lake, the joy of a long-awaited reunion instantly turned into a wisp of smoke, a wisp of smoke containing the vicissitudes of thousands of affairs. Thus, I shed a few sentimental tears!

In the autumn of my twenty-third year, for the sake of graduation sketching, I came to Hangzhou for the first time as a student with an excited mood. At that time, I and many students from the art school lived in the Huizhong Hotel on Huanhu Road. I spent all day carrying an oil painting box sketching everywhere. What made me linger the most was the Su Xiaoxiao Tomb Pavilion at the head of Xiling Bridge and the Manju burial mound in front of the Release Crane Pavilion under Gushan Mountain. Therefore, I painted two commemorative paintings. One was "Moon over Xiling Bridge." The scene, I can still vaguely remember, was a tranquil lake surface with a stone bridge with a semi-circular hole spanning it. At the corner of the bridge, the Su Xiaoxiao Tomb Pavilion was desolate, accompanied by a weeping willow, with a cold moon hanging on the willow tip. The other was "The Poetic Soul of Gushan." The scene seemed to focus on Manju's grave, on which stood a clay white crane. Gushan embraced the cemetery where the poet was buried, and a corner of Feng Xiaoqing's Tomb Pavilion reduced much of Manju's loneliness. Poetic souls accompanied poetic souls, and West Lake fostered their poetic inspiration on the side. These two paintings can be considered my quite satisfactory works, but unfortunately, they were preserved until the war broke out and were finally destroyed in the flames of war. Because I read a lot of poems and articles about Su Xiaoxiao when I was a child, I feel great pity for her. Especially Manju, I have read many of her novels and letters, and I deeply admire and sympathize with her thoughts, character, and life experiences. Often at dusk, I would lie alone in front of his grave, indulging in all kinds of boundless reveries. Sometimes I would bring a bamboo flute and sit on his grave, playing it quietly. I once naively hoped that I could use this secluded music to awaken his slumber and bring his poetic soul back to this world again! I mourned him and missed him so sincerely. At that time, I stayed in Hangzhou for more than a week. In addition to visiting some scenic spots on the lake, I also went to Lingyin, Taoguang, Tianzhu, Nine Streams and Eighteen Gullies, and Hupao. I also went to Qiantang and painted a "Shadow of Qiantang Pagoda." The scene was Qiantang River and Liuhe Pagoda. (This painting was selected by the school as my graduation work.) But among all the scenic spots I visited, I still prefer and miss Xiling Bridge and Gushan Mountain.

The second time I came to Hangzhou was in the autumn of my twenty-fifth year with Wen Yidao. My mood was leisurely. We stayed at the Die Lai Hotel at the head of Xiling Bridge, so I was able to lean against Su Xiaoxiao's Tomb Pavilion morning and evening. After crossing the bridge and walking along a short stretch of grass by West Lake, you arrive at Manju's cemetery. This time, although I didn't bring a painting box, I brought a camera, so I took a few more photos here. We toured all the scenic spots in Hangzhou. We often went to the solemn and solemn Yue Fei Temple to taste tea and chat. We rowed a small boat to Jingci Temple and asked for some funny and embarrassing fortune slips in front of the statue of the Old Man Under the Moon. We went to Liu Zhuang to drink and appreciate chrysanthemums, stopping only when we were slightly drunk. We draped in moonlight, swayed in the heart of the lake, sang loudly, or meditated silently. We once walked to Yuquan Temple, our feet treading on the stones by the Pearl Pool, shaking out strings of bubbles, competing to see who could do better. We raced to Lingyin; climbed the Twin Peaks; went to Taoguang; ascended Tianzhu; the road was lined with green trees and bamboos, dotted with yellow and white wildflowers, which was especially interesting and lovely. I couldn't help but admire that the autumn in Jiangnan is more tender and charming than the spring in North China. We also climbed over mountains and crossed Nine Streams and Eighteen Gullies, exclaiming along the way as if the road ahead was a dead end! We used the water from Hupao Spring to brew Longjing tea, and the clear fragrance washed away the infinite dust from our souls! We had so much fun; we enjoyed ourselves to the fullest; we forgot our difficulties; we forgot our fatigue; we seemed to not know what sorrow was, our hearts were still young!

Unexpectedly, twelve years later, I came to Hangzhou for the third time, and it was still autumn. But now, the travel companions are different, the mood is different, and the circumstances are different! Those classmates from the art school are scattered! Wen has become the mother of two children. The first time, the mood was excited, and West Lake and I were full of vitality; the second time, the mood was leisurely, and West Lake and I were as happy. But this third time, the mood is desolate, and West Lake and I are as listless and haggard!

When playing with everyone, I am always taciturn and speak little. I am always lost in endless contemplation. I seem to recall something I lost in the past; I also seem to grieve for all the gloomy reality; I also seem to look forward to some illusory dreams of the future! In short, I have thousands of feelings for every grass, every flower, every stone, and every drop of water. I can't express my boundless reverie. My emotions are confused and dizzy. I am like a lamb lost in the mountains and fields!

The first thing that made me sad was that the Su Xiaoxiao Tomb Pavilion at the head of Xiling Bridge was painted with an ugly red color that ruined the scenery. The gate of the Yue Fei Temple also has the same terrible mark. The Qiu Jin Shrine, the revolutionary female martyr who resisted Japan, has disappeared, leaving only a dilapidated memorial tower. I seem to feel that these are all insults to our poetic souls and national souls given to us by the enemy and puppets!

The second thing that made me sad was that the Manju cemetery had become a wasteland. The white crane on the grave had flown away, and the green pines and cypresses around the grave were nowhere to be found. The ground was covered with withered grass, and the remaining lotus flowers by the lake added to the infinite sorrow! Gushan asking for plum blossoms yielded no news! A few withered poles stood rigidly on the wasteland. The Release Crane Pavilion was intact, but the Expo Bridge under the pavilion was torn down, supposedly used by the Japanese as construction material. The pavilions and towers of Three Pools Mirroring the Moon and Peaceful Lake in Autumn Moon are all dilapidated, obviously in a state of disrepair for many years, which makes people feel unbearable desolation!

The scenery of Liu Zhuang still has traces of its former splendor, but it is also full of dust and dirt, and the garden is full of weeds. The former grand occasion of chrysanthemums is gone, and only a few withered lotus flowers remain in a pool of stagnant water.

Everyone wanted to visit the Old Man Under the Moon in Jingci Temple, and one friend was eager to ask for a fortune slip for good news. But the boatman told us that Jingci Temple was also demolished by the Japanese, and the Old Man Under the Moon was buried in the flames! Hearing this news, everyone felt infinite regret! Everyone complained for this matchmaker who specialized in doing good deeds—the Old Man Under the Moon! Mr. Hong Shen said humorously: "No wonder there are so many tragedies today. It turns out that the Old Man Under the Moon has died a natural death, and no one is helping lovers to tie the knot, so they can't become couples!" Han Sheng said it even more wonderfully. He wished the Old Man Under the Moon would show a miracle and punish Japanese men to all become widowers!

This time I didn't go to Nine Streams and Eighteen Gullies, but only went to Lingyin. In front of the Jigong Buddha statue, everyone asked for fortune slips to ask about luck; to ask about wealth; to ask about safety; to ask about the current situation. Mr. Hong Shen asked for a very auspicious slip for Mr. Gen, which roughly told him: Where there is a will, there is a way. So he immediately made a grand oath that once Mr. Gen is realized, he would raise gold bars to build a temple to thank the Bodhisattva. Everyone rejoiced for this vague hope, and even the old monk laughed heartily! I also asked for a slip to ask about good and bad fortune. The first sentence on the slip was: "Suddenly hearing thunder without wind or rain," and my heart couldn't help but skip a few beats. Heaven, am I, such a silent and calm person, still have to suffer thunder strikes innocently without wind or rain? I don't believe it, but I am a little afraid!

I didn't have time to go to Taoguang and Tianzhu again. On the way back, I played at Yuquan Temple, and everyone stomped on the edge of the Pearl Pool to make bubbles. I didn't, my heart was so heavy that it seemed like it would fall if I stepped on it.

Finally, I paid homage to Yue Fei's tomb. Qin Hui and his wife were still kneeling in front of Yue Fei. At this time, I thought: Why not add two more bronze statues and let Wang Jingwei and his wife also kneel to our Yue Wumu and repent?

At dusk, I walked out of the Yue Fei's tomb, and the sound of the bell rang, breaking my daydream!

On the morning of my departure, I wandered alone on the Bai Causeway lined with green willows. The West Lake was calm and waveless. As the autumn wind rose, a fallen leaf drifted on the water. There were few tourists, and small boats were lonely moored under the embankment. The shadows of the sails swayed like a school of fish. A few faint bird calls were like a few sighs, as if murmuring:

'Ten years of wind and rain have sickened West Lake! Ten years of vicissitudes have aged West Lake! Ten years of separation, old friends no longer have their old moods! Ten years of dreams, all are depressing!'

I shed a few tears silently! I silently prayed: May West Lake have regained its health when I come again for the fourth time; regained its youth; I have also regained my joy; and the entire universe has regained its peaceful and happy appearance!

### Quotations from Turgenev

— Fan Xiren

Everyone knows that time sometimes flies as fast as a bird, and sometimes crawls as slow as a snail; but the happiest time is when one doesn't notice whether it passes quickly or slowly.

What's the use of discussing the future? Nine-tenths of the future is not up to us. If there is an opportunity to do something at that time—it is best not to have it; if there is no opportunity—at least you can congratulate yourself for not saying many boring empty words in advance.

### Addendum to "Bai Ju Chang"

— Qi Liang

I just saw Mr. Bao's "Shi Nai'an in Bai Ju Chang" in Shen Bao's "Chun Qiu," which is no less than a testimony to Shi Nai'an's life, which is really gratifying.

A Mr. Wu from Xinghua, whose name I'm sorry I can't remember, told me that Shi Nai'an lived in Cao Yan Town, Dianhua, ninety miles away from the city. There are many people with the surname Shi in the town, who are Shi Nai'an's descendants. According to us, Shi Nai'an was originally from Zhongzhou. At the end of the Yuan Dynasty, Zhang Shicheng raised troops. He helped Shicheng. Later, Shicheng failed, and Zhu Yuanzhang became the emperor. He was suspicious and murderous, so he lived in Cao Yan Town and never came out again.

I remember reading a "Chenjiang Old Tales" of some kind, but I forgot who wrote it. It seems that there was such a passage: Shi Nai'an, courtesy name Zi'an, was from Huaian. During the reign of Emperor Shun of Yuan Dynasty, he was awarded a Jinshi and served as a tutor for the Xu family in Jiangyin. He once served as an official in Qiantang. When Zhang Shicheng occupied Gaoyou, he recruited him, but he refused. Shicheng was defeated, and Shi Nai'an also died.

A Mr. Hu once confirmed to me that he had been to Baiju Bridge in Dongtai and checked the Shi family genealogy of Baiju Bridge. What was recorded on the genealogy was exactly like this. Now, after reading Mr. Bao's article, I know that Baiju Bridge is a mistake for Baiju Chang. And Baiju Chang has Shi Nai'an's collateral descendants, Shi Nai'an's ancestral hall, and Shi Gong's tomb. Cao Yan Town also has Shi Nai'an's descendants, so Shi Nai'an's later years should have been spent between Xinghua and Dongtai.

Hu Yinglin's Zhuang Yue Wei Tan calls Shi Nai'an a certain Shi from Wulin, probably because he heard that he had served as an official in Qiantang, that's why he said that. It also said that he wrote the Water Margin like that, and his disciple Luo also imitated him to write the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Li Zhuowu's 120-chapter version of Water Margin is titled Shi Ji compiled, Luo revised, and Jin Shenghuan's 70-chapter version argues that everything after the 70th chapter is Luo Guanzhong's superfluous ending. Since Shi Nai'an and Guanzhong were both master and disciple, and there were these imitations and collaborations in their creation, they should have often been together. Wang Qi's Continued Comprehensive Examination of Literature says that Guanzhong was from Hangzhou (Dongdu). Based on this, perhaps Shi Nai'an's original hometown was Zhongzhou, but he spent more time in the south as an official, teacher, and writer.

He was a northerner, and he was also awarded a Jinshi, so he may not have been satisfied with the corrupt government. Or he was a southerner. At that time, southerners were even lower than northerners, so he couldn't stand the various insults and persecutions. When Zhang Shicheng revolted in Baiju Chang, he joined. "Refused to be recruited," this statement may not be reliable. Shi Nai'an's descendants were afraid that Zhu Yuanzhang would see that Shi Nai'an helped Shicheng and massacre his family, so they had to write "refused," but in fact he "joined."

Afterwards, Shicheng was defeated and died, and Shi Nai'an returned to Baiju Chang, which he commemorated, and moved his resistance to dark politics from the battlefield to the literary field, and thus the Water Margin was produced, which is very possible, right?

There is no book to examine, so I will record it for the time being, and I will use it to consult with the wise. Fortunately, Dongtai and Xinghua are not far away, so it will not be difficult to conduct on-the-spot investigations in the future.

### Shi Nai'an and Zhang Shicheng

— Wang Zhexing

I read Mr. Bao Yujun's article "Shi Nai'an in Bai Ju Chang" in the October 29th issue of this journal, which records the story of Shi Nai'an, the author of Water Margin, in Bai Ju Chang between Xinghua and Dongtai in northern Jiangsu. Mr. Bao personally visited the place and saw Mr. Shi's ancestral hall and his descendants, and paid homage to this great author, which makes people yearn for it.

Shi Nai'an stayed in Xinghua for the longest time. Because Bai Ju belongs to a famous town in the eastern part of Xinghua, the people of Xinghua have long regarded Mr. Shi as a native of Xinghua. Mr. Bao Yujun said that Shi was from Luoyang, which must be based on something, but according to my judgment, perhaps Shi Nai'an's original home was Luoyang, but he lived in Xinghua until he died of old age. The time is long, and it is no different from belonging to Xinghua.

Because we are talking about Shi Nai'an's presence in Bai Ju, we have to mention Zhang Shicheng, who once claimed to be king in Suzhou and was loved by the people so much that they have not forgotten him to this day. And Shi Nai'an has a very deep relationship with Zhang Shicheng. Zhang is also from Bai Ju, so it is very valuable to describe it.

Zhang Shicheng's childhood name was "Xiao Si." He was from Bai Ju, Xinghua. Bai Ju was a salt farm by the sea. Zhang made a living by selling salt when he was young. He and Shi Nai'an once studied literature and martial arts with the same teacher. Their skills were comparable. At the end of the Yuan Dynasty, when the government was corrupt and the political situation was corrupt, heroes from all over the world rose up. The two of them took it as their duty to save the country and appease the people. Later, Zhang Shicheng claimed to be King of Wu in Suzhou, and Shi Nai'an served as a privy councillor, assisting in military affairs and making many achievements. Unfortunately, many of the plans failed to be implemented later, and the two of them became suspicious of each other. Finally, Shi Nai'an abandoned his old friend and went to work as a tutor in the house of a big landlord in Jiangyin. The loss of this arm and assistant to the King of Wu greatly affected the later success or failure. However, the scale left by Shi Nai'an made Zhang Shicheng always love the people like his own children. This kind of virtue may not be comparable to Zhu Yuanzhang and Chen Youliang at the same time. It is a pity that Zhang and Shi could not cooperate to the end, otherwise the world at that time might not have belonged to a monk.

In addition to teaching students in the house of a landlord in Jiangyin, Shi Nai'an saw that the owner's wealth was abundant and that he could make a great career, so he strongly urged the owner to revolt, and also recruited many patriots and local braves for active training. However, the owner later failed to rise up in time due to different interests, which Shi regretted very much, so he left in disappointment. However, the people's morale in Jiangyin has since flourished. The later heroic deeds of resisting Japanese pirates and defending against thieves, as well as the martyrs who died in various disasters, were all inspired by this.

After Shi Nai'an left Jiangyin, he realized that the general trend was over and the world would belong to the Ming Dynasty, so he returned to his hometown of Bai Ju and closed the door to write books. Thus, this great work—Water Margin—was produced. The writing style of Water Margin is vivid and profound. Some people say it is very similar to the Records of the Grand Historian. Indeed, Shi Nai'an's depressed feelings were similar to Sima Qian's anger in his heart, so their works were all expressing their anger. If Shi Nai'an could have been successful and domineering in that era, he would definitely not have had the time to write Water Margin. This is a blessing for us later generations. To be private, fortunately, Mr. Shi Nai'an was not successful in his life, otherwise his achievements would be remarkable, but he would definitely not be able to release such a wonderful flower in literature. The old people have seen enough of the so-called heroic and domineering achievements of kings in ancient and modern times. They say that it is better to have a pot of clear tea and read Water Margin in their spare time!

### An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, An Inch of Blood 82

— Ye Jingfeng

When I got to the stream, I was suddenly startled to hear what sounded like a few dog barks from within the restricted area. I asked Tiger if he heard it, and he said absentmindedly, "There must always be dogs, right?" I also thought that wherever there are Japanese devils, there are bound to be vicious dogs. These dogs trained by the Japanese devils are vicious and brutal. Not only can they track by scent, jump, bite, and devour, but they are also good at stealing, ambushing, luring the enemy, giving alarms, and fighting. If they don't bite you, fine, but once they bite you, you can't escape. Moreover, once they smell blood, they will turn into wild beasts and have to tear people apart and chew them into pieces.

It was already past seven o'clock, and dusk had fallen. The clouds were very low, and details of the scenery could not be distinguished beyond two or three zhang, only a blur. We hid in the wild thickets by the stream, planning to cross the stream. Tiger casually picked up a few small stones from the ground and threw them into the water one by one, from near to far. Seeing the speed at which the bubbles rose, he knew that the stream was not deep, at most reaching waist height.

"Aunt, I'll go first!" Tiger tied the small bag slung over his body to his belt, held a pistol in each hand, turned to look at me, and stepped into the water. I also acted nimbly, glanced around, and followed Tiger into the water, probing with each step. Although Tiger was eight or nine years younger than me, he was almost half an inch taller than me. We both could swim, so the water wasn't scary. What was hateful was the mud at the bottom of the stream. No matter how hard you tried to hold your breath, your feet would always sink half a foot, and it was really hard to pull each step out. At the deepest point, the water was already up to our waists. Fortunately, it wasn't stagnant water, and there was no smell. Anyway, my clothes were already soaked with sweat, so it wasn't too uncomfortable.

When we reached the bank, because it was a slope of soil with no cover, we had to crouch down and crawl along the slope, step by step. We had just climbed to the base of the stone wall when a beam of light, like lightning, swept across the stream from the wild thickets on the opposite bank to the base of the wall. The sudden beam of light startled me into a cold sweat, and my heart beat so hard that it almost hit my throat. Tiger and I instinctively reached out at the same time and stopped each other, as if to press our bodies into the wall.

"Oh, did the devils see us?" Tiger whispered in surprise.

"Not necessarily," I reassured Tiger, "it seems like the light is coming from the bridge over there, isn't it?"

We both leaned our backs against the stone wall, sat at the base of the wall, and stretched our legs straight down the slope to minimize our target. At this time, we couldn't move rashly, we could only wait for the situation to develop. The seven-character secret of espionage training came in handy here: "Cold" and "Endure."

While we waited quietly, we both secretly held our weapons in our hands, perhaps a second later, bullets would be raining down on us. At this time, what was most useful was the ear, followed by the eye, so I focused my energy on the two senses of hearing and sight. Although I was brave and clear-headed, I still felt my heart pounding. Our feeling at this time was like two deer being restrained by hunting dogs, only prepared for a death match.

I think after five or six minutes at most, the searchlight swept across again. I heard Tiger muttering to himself in a whisper that could barely be heard: "Damn it, if you have the guts, come over here, who are you scaring with this ghost fire?"

Just then, I heard the sound of military boots stepping on the gravel road far away on the other side of the stone wall. It seemed like there was only one person, walking towards us from the bridge, very slowly. After a while, I heard a huffing and puffing sound, like a kind of mighty aura emanating from a huge beast, mixed with heavy footsteps, getting closer and closer to us.

### Sold by Auction

— Shao Fu

The Central Trust Bureau's second public notice for the auction of 39 units of enemy and puppet properties was published the day before yesterday. On the same day, the residents of these 39 units issued an urgent notice. The situation between the two sides is very tense. If this matter is handled improperly, it may lead to unexpected events.

Yesterday, the heads of the Trust Bureau and the Disposal Bureau expressed their opinions on the matter. The first paragraph of the news stated:

"Since the victory, the housing shortage in this city has been serious. In order to assist the government in solving housing difficulties, the Central Trust Bureau has planned to advance funds to build houses and sell them in installments. The estimated cost is 40 billion yuan, which will be funded by a banking syndicate established by national banks and commercial banks, and a method for advancing construction funds has been drafted and submitted to the Joint Treasury for approval. This plan was just approved by the 325th board meeting of the Joint Treasury on October 24. Before it is actually implemented... (The following talks about selling it by auction)."

Yes, yes, you see, the government is already trying to help you, but before it is actually implemented, it will sell this batch of real estate first, yes, yes, you really don't know how to appreciate it!

How can people who are suffering from the pain of losing their homes know how to appreciate it? These people are neither silkworms nor children, but the Trust Bureau is asking them to give up the big cake in their hands that they desperately need to fill their stomachs and imagine the Manchu Han banquet next year.

Can't they just use this 40 billion yuan to buy this batch of houses and rent them out to the original tenants? Combining fundraising, construction, and auction into one thing is the most wise way, and it also fulfills the government's goal of solving the housing difficulties of the common people. I think the wise Trust Bureau and Disposal Bureau will definitely consider this.

Common Sense

### Idle Talk on Earthquakes

— Jinxia

Newspapers report: A strong earthquake occurred in the northwest of Tokyo on the afternoon of the 2nd, lasting for four hours.

Here, let's talk about earthquakes in passing:

The Earth is constantly experiencing various minute molecular movements, which are usually not easily noticed by humans because these vibrations are extremely slight. However, under special circumstances, drastic changes occur, and this is what we call an earthquake.

There are three causes of earthquakes: volcanic eruptions, land subsidence, and fault rupture.

During volcanic eruptions, the surrounding areas are shaken, causing houses to collapse and people to be injured. However, earthquakes are limited to the volcanic region and cause relatively little damage. Land subsidence occurs when limestone in the Earth's crust is eroded by groundwater. A portion of the minerals is dissolved, creating cavities and fissures. The supporting force is weakened, leading to downward subsidence and causing subsidence earthquakes. As the Earth gradually cools and contracts, folding occurs, causing cracks in the deep inner layers of the Earth. The Earth's crust moves up and down along these deep, large cracks, resulting in fault rupture earthquakes, which have the widest range and greatest intensity.

Records

Earthquakes have occurred since the beginning of recorded history, and even today, there is a possibility of earthquakes happening anytime, anywhere. In the past, the French seismologist Bayeux alone collected records of 170,000 earthquakes from various countries. Statistical analysis revealed that earthquakes commonly occur in two major regions: around the Pacific Ocean and along the Mediterranean Sea, the Alps, the Caucasus Mountains, and the Himalayas.

In the past twenty years, countries that have experienced earthquakes include: Turkey, Japan, Chile, Romania, the United States, China, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Argentina, the Soviet Union, Mexico, France, Italy, India, Greece, and fifteen other countries.

Tragic Extremes

The following are records of some of the most devastating earthquakes with the highest casualties and greatest losses: The Great Tokyo Earthquake in Japan in 1923 killed over 84,000 people in Tokyo, and Yokohama was also affected, with over 40,000 deaths and injuries. On January 24, 1939, a violent earthquake occurred in southern Chile, affecting dozens of cities. Among the 200,000 residents in the disaster area, the death toll reached 25 percent—50,000 people—and nine cities were completely destroyed. On November 10, 1940, a major earthquake struck southeastern Europe, with Romania bearing the brunt. Over 10,000 people were killed or injured. The twelve-story Carlton Apartments, the most solid reinforced concrete building in the capital of Romania, collapsed in the earthquake, burying many travelers in the rubble. However, the night watchman of the apartment, who was on duty when the earthquake struck, used a heavy blanket to protect his head and jumped from the twelve-story building. Although seriously injured, he still reported the incident to the fire department. The most tragic earthquake in China was the Gansu earthquake, which killed over 200,000 people. There were many places where the ground collapsed, with lengths of 3,000 to 4,000 feet, widths of 2,000 feet, and depths of 400 to 500 feet, burying houses, people, and livestock.

False Alarm

There were also earthquakes that only caused false alarms without any loss of life. On the night of June 29, 1942, several violent earthquakes suddenly occurred in the capital of Chile. In their panic, residents ran barefoot and naked to the center of the streets. After standing there for a long time, the earthquakes suddenly stopped, with no deaths or injuries. In Paris, minor earthquakes occurred continuously in March 1940. Many citizens were asleep and unaware of these events. It was not until they read the newspapers the next morning that they breathed a sigh of relief.

Although they are all earthquakes, there are differences between fortune and misfortune.

### Salary Increase? Increased? Not Increased!

I saw in the newspaper that the central government has decided to adjust the salaries of public school teachers. Changzhou, where I am located, is listed in the second tier. According to the standard calculation, the monthly income can reach more than 100,000. I was dreaming of how to buy new clothes, but reality woke me up.

Two months ago, in almost the same position in the same newspaper, I saw the news of adjusting the treatment of public school teachers. The standard for the Jiangsu region was a base of 55,000 yuan, multiplied by 240 times, which was about two-thirds more than the original standard at that time. Upon hearing the news, I also planned how to buy new clothes and shoes, but waiting, waiting, the central level was implemented, and the provincial level was also implemented, but it "stopped here". Because we are at the county level, we are not qualified to benefit. Colleagues often ask each other: Is it because county-level civil servants do less work than civil servants above? Obviously not! I had the opportunity to talk to the local officials about this issue, and he told me that the reason is that the local income is insufficient. The county collects and spends on its own. Although the standard is increased, there is no money to increase. I believe this is true, but I want to ask the authorities: When making the decision, did you think that after the standard is set, provincial-level and below civil servants can be ignored if the local income is insufficient? Or did you not consider that the local government would have no money to pay after the standard was set, so you did not find a way to subsidize it so that the decision could be implemented? Before I understand this answer, I dare not have any hope for this adjustment.

Today, a friend met me and asked me with certainty: "Salary increase?" "Not increased!" I can only temporarily answer like this.

### To Sanmao

— Xiaotian

Dear Sanmao,

I admire your ability. Although you are an innocent and lively underage child, your ambition, wisdom, and courage... are everywhere like an adult. No, even adults are not as good as you, especially in dealing with people. You can handle it freely and actively among the leaders and comrades. This surprises me that you are an extraordinary child, and it is also a characteristic that surpasses ordinary children. Precisely because of your youth, you are often humiliated by your superiors and bullied by your comrades, but you are not discouraged or resentful... You still stand firmly on your position, grasp your own responsibilities, and use your patriotic wisdom to strike at the enemy everywhere.

When you take off your military uniform and bid farewell to your superiors, embarking on the social journey, that V-shaped fork in the road is forcing you, standing there helplessly, looking down at the cross-shaped cemetery beside the road, which is full of fighters who died on the battlefield. Here are your comrades you used to get along with, as well as patriots who have made meritorious deeds and gloriously sacrificed themselves, and martyrs who have been recorded in history. Now, they are all silently sleeping in the underworld. I think you will also feel infinite sadness in your heart, but when you look up at the tip of the V, I am afraid you will feel pain more unbearable than death—unemployment, that corner of the house covered with cobwebs, and the high chimneys, are the closed factories—(no work to do). On the other hand, the so-called "returning to hometown after demobilization", the remaining dead trees, you can't see houses, and you can't see smoke. When I see you have no place to live and no food to eat, I can't help but take a cold breath for you. Is it true that after serving the country for several years, you will be vaguely unprotected and end up like this? You are really too young. Naturally, you don't have a thorough understanding of the vicissitudes of the world and the warmth and coldness of human relationships. However, you don't have to be pessimistic. This is precisely the life you have tasted, and it is also an alarm bell that tells you to "rely on your own efforts." I hope that you will persevere in the will you had when you joined the army, endure it, fail once and come again until you succeed. On the uneven road of life, you are only allowed to advance and not retreat!

I have been concerned about your news, and I wish you good health!

### Past Events of the Traitor Zhou

— Luo

The traitor Zhou Fohai has recently been publicly tried. It is said that on the day of the trial, the wooden benches of the High Court in the capital were crushed. No wonder Zhou felt very embarrassed. I accidentally flipped through Zhou's masterpiece "Collection of the Past" during the enemy and puppet period. In "Record of a Fire", Zhou described the experience of his residence being burned down during the puppet government era. Now, when Zhou has become a "prisoner awaiting execution", reading it really makes me feel cold for Zhou. The original text is excerpted as follows: —

"When the fire was raging, the first person to come to comfort and take care of us was Madam Wang. When she heard the news, she immediately ran to take care of us, and she was afraid that we had no place to live, so she immediately called Minyi and vacated a few rooms in his house. Because Madam Minyi went to Shanghai, the house could be vacated. Then she accompanied us to Minyi's house..."

If those "causality experts" or word-splitting gentlemen analyze the above sentences, we really feel cold for Zhou's future "destination". Chu Minyi has been executed, and "Madam Wang" still wants to introduce Zhou to live in Chu's haunted house. Zhou's betrayal of the country was also pulled in by the traitor Chen Bijun. Think about how chilling it is.

In "Feelings After Four Travels to Beiping", Zhou described the grand occasion of welcoming him after the puppet government returned to Ping in the 29th year of the Republic of China, when local pedestrian traffic was cut off.

"But even more than 30 years ago, even when princes and ministers went out, the traffic was not completely cut off. As a poor student, I actually entered and exited the capital of hundreds of years of emperors, and the traffic was cut off. Subconsciously, I couldn't help but feel proud. However, it was not like this more than 30 years ago. It was not like this when China was unified. I really felt that it was not perfect."

In fact, at that time, the traitors of the puppet government were often assassinated. Therefore, the only way to maintain security was to cut off traffic. Zhou actually became "self-comfortable". Aren't you afraid that the readers will be horrified?

In "Trip to Guangzhou", Zhou said again:

"...Take off at 11 o'clock, bypass Hong Kong and enter the Pearl River Basin. When passing through Hong Kong, I recalled the scene when I flew to Jiuneng with Gongbo in Hanoi in December of the 27th year, and Siping went to the airport to pick us up. It is still vivid in my mind..."

Zhou is really sentimental and full of emotion. Traitor Chen and Traitor Mei are now waiting for you at the airport in the underworld. Please wait patiently to meet.

### Remembering Ma Chaojun

— Younan

……The new Minister of Agriculture and Labor……

Anyone who has stayed in Nanjing after the victory must be familiar with Ma Chaojun, who presided over the capital for the second time.

For Nanjing, it is certainly difficult to be the mayor; first, it is the seat of the National Government, and it is related to the observation of China and foreign countries. One can be scolded if one is not careful. After the victory, Nanjing was always not very energetic, the streets and roadsides were messy and lifeless. I remember that when Chairman Jiang first triumphantly returned to the capital, he did not show satisfaction with everything in the capital. However, from the perspective of the municipal government of Nanjing, there was little money and much work, and various difficulties.

Two Horses Fighting

The most sensational thing in Nanjing during Mayor Ma's tenure was an article in the Central Daily News in Nanjing advocating the prohibition of dancing. The title was "Accept the Provocation of the Municipal Government". The article said, "Nanjing under Mayor Ma's rule is obviously provoking us who advocate frugality." The most intense sentence in the article had the words "you die or I live", which made Mayor Ma quite embarrassed for a while. At that time, the matter was mediated by Ma Yuanfang, the deputy mayor of Nanjing, and the Dagang News made a title saying: "Two Horses Fight, Another Horse Mediates." (Note: The president of the Central Daily News in Nanjing was Ma Xingye)

In all fairness, there are indeed many things that were not satisfactory in Nanjing under Mayor Ma's rule. Now, the mayor of Nanjing has changed, and Mr. Ma has been transferred to the Minister of Agriculture and Labor. We hope that Nanjing and the Ministry of Agriculture and Labor will be able to find someone who is deeply competent.

According to Mr. Ma's research experience in the labor movement for ten years, Mr. Ma has compiled and written books such as "Chinese Labor Problems", "Agricultural and Labor Policies of the Chinese Kuomintang", "Wage and Price Index Table", and "Agricultural Product Price Index Table", all of which were completed in his spare time. Today, he has been transferred to a new position, and I think it should be more suitable for Mr. Ma's talents.

Ma Chaojun, also known as Ma Gong, is from Taishan, Guangdong. He graduated from "Bili Mechanical School" in Hong Kong in his early years. After that, he went to Japan to study at Meiji University, and devoted himself to the revolutionary cause, starting in the 33rd year of Guangxu. At that time, Mr. Ma advocated the revolution in Qinlian, Guangdong Province. He was arrested by the local official Guo Renzhang and released on bail by the American pastor Xia Shigu. Before the uprising of the Seventy-Two Martyrs of Huanghuagang, Mr. Ma hid explosives in his hair (at that time, long hair was still braided) and transported them from Hong Kong to Guangzhou to support the revolutionaries, but he was not discovered.

During the Wuchang Uprising, Mr. Ma served as the captain of the daredevil team and was stationed at the Hanyang Arsenal. In the second year of the Republic of China, he was falsely accused and imprisoned in the Hubei Army Prison by the order of Li Yuanhong, and was released after four months.

Leading the Labor Movement

After the tenth year of the Republic of China, Mr. Ma abandoned arms and devoted himself to the labor movement and education, and was elected as a municipal senator in Guangzhou. In the eleventh year, the traitor Chen Jiongming rebelled, and Mr. Ma and his wife Shen Huilian protected Madam Sun from danger. After the incident was quelled, the national father Sun Yat-sen became a propaganda member of the headquarters, and soon he was transferred to the director of the Guangdong Arsenal. In March of the fourteenth year, the national father went north, and he was ill in Tianjin. From the onset of the illness until his death, Mr. Ma stayed by his side and personally prepared the medicine.

In the eighteenth year, Mr. Ma was often selected as a central executive committee member. In April, he was sent to attend the International Labor Conference in Geneva, proposing that "colored people should be treated equally with all member states", and he finally passed it with his unyielding spirit.

Mr. Ma first served as the mayor of Nanjing in April of the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China, and he was reinstated after the victory.

In Nanjing, the most impressive thing to me was Mr. Ma and his wife (Shen Huilian). Both of their sons were big and strong, and in the dance parties that entertained the allies, their "big dance" always caused laughter.
