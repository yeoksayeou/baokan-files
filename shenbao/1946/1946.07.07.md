### The Five-Person Talks Are Very Harmonious; Both Sides' Opinions Are Approaching; Partial Agreement Is Reached on the Issue of Administrative Authority in Communist Areas; Discussion Results Are Individually Reported

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] The five-person talks temporarily formed by representatives of the government and the Chinese Communist Party held their third meeting at 4:00 PM today at No. 23 Baiziting, the residence of Foreign Minister Wang Shijie. Government representatives Wang Shijie, Chen Cheng, and Shao Lizi, and CCP representatives Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu all attended. It is reported that today's meeting not only continued to discuss the administrative authority issue after the withdrawal of communist troops from the main communist areas and from Harbin, Rehe, Northern Jiangsu, Jiaodong, and Northern Anhui, but also briefly touched on the implementation of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) resolutions, government reorganization, and the convening of the National Assembly. It is reported that as a result of today's discussions, the government representatives provided very detailed analyses of each issue and put forward relatively practical and concrete opinions. At the same time, the CCP representatives, regarding the government's consistent and serious stance in deciding to convene the National Assembly to demonstrate its commitment to implementing the PCC resolutions, the main purpose of which is to accelerate the completion of the work of unity and unification to realize national peace, no longer misunderstood it as they had before. Therefore, the opinions of both sides are closer than before. It is also reported that Chen Cheng will report on the day's meeting tonight to Chairman Chen. According to a certain person close to both sides' representatives, today's meeting achieved partial agreement on the issue of administrative authority in the communist-held areas. If further discussions yield results, the situation is expected to improve.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] It is learned that today's five-person talks discussed political issues related to military affairs, such as the administrative issues after the withdrawal of communist troops from Rehe and Northern Jiangsu. Although the details have not been released, judging from the tone of the representatives after the meeting and the relaxed demeanor of the representatives in recent weeks, it seems that today's meeting has achieved some success. Tonight, behind-the-scenes news faintly revealed that the issue of the communist troops' withdrawal from Rehe and Northern Jiangsu has the hope of being resolved first. It is also reported that the government continued to make concessions during today's meeting, so Zhou Enlai looked very happy after the meeting. However, according to neutral individuals close to both sides' representatives, the five-person talks have reached the stage of separate consultations, and it is believed that the two sides will conduct mutual discussions with Ambassador Ma tomorrow.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] The five-person talks began at 4:00 PM today, and Minister Wang left first at 6:10 PM due to other engagements. It is said that he went directly to the International Club at the invitation of the Norwegian Ambassador. When reporters inquired about the news, Wang replied with a smile: "The four people inside are still in talks, please wait a moment." After about ten minutes, Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu came out. Zhou greeted the reporters waiting at the door with a smile, and his hearty laughter could still be heard far outside the car after he boarded. Then Chen Cheng and Shao Lizi came out. Chen said: "The atmosphere of today's talks was very good." Shao said: "Today's talks were entirely about military administrative issues. The atmosphere was very good during the talks, but there were no concrete decisions to announce." As for when the five-person talks will be held again, Shao said that he was not aware of it, as the notices are all temporary. After the meeting, Chen and Shao had a nearly one-hour conversation at Chen's residence. Furthermore, it is said that the issue of the full administrative authority of the recovered areas was submitted for discussion during today's talks, and both sides are separately consulting with Chairman Chiang and Yan'an regarding the results.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] Regarding the rumors that the government will be reorganized before September, Shao Lizi stated that it is too early to say, as the reorganization of the government is one of the five resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. If the issues currently pending can be resolved smoothly, this matter can be implemented immediately, but it is not possible to determine the date at present.

It is learned that the government side has approved the meeting between Du Yuming and Lin Biao, so the Du-Lin meeting can be realized. When reporters asked whether the rumor that Hu Zongnan would be in charge of military affairs in the Northeast was reliable, the spokesperson said that in his judgment, it was absolutely unreliable.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 6th] The 27th group of the Military Mediation Department in Shenyang held a meeting on the morning of the 5th. Huang Chenglie from the government side, Wang Shoudao from the CCP, and Raulman from the US side all attended to discuss the Faku issue. The communist side insisted that the national army entered Faku on the 8th, while the government side stated that it had garrisoned Faku on the 6th, and after the ceasefire order was issued, it immediately stopped its actions, and there was factual evidence to prove it. The two sides debated fiercely. Later, it was decided that the three parties would send people to investigate to clarify the truth.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 6th] Belden flew to Beiping this morning to report to General Beaudry on his work during his acting period in Changchun. (Note: Beaudry is in Beidaihe for vacation).

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 6th] Chief Du originally planned to inspect various places in the near future, but now he has to postpone it while waiting for a meeting with Lin Biao.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 6th] Communist troops within Rehe have recently violated the agreement again and moved frequently.

The telegram, issued on the morning of the 5th, stated that the government and the Chinese Communist Party have announced a nationwide continuation of the ceasefire to await further discussions. The three Executive Committee members hereby instruct all unit commanders not to take offensive actions, including forward attacks and pursuits. The groups must assist in formally conveying the news of the extension of the ceasefire period to each smallest unit. As for some locations where the groups cannot carry out their work due to the absence of group personnel, refusal to take action, or restrictions, the current personnel of the groups will take all possible steps and use their respective authority to spread the news of this continued ceasefire, and the groups will immediately report any violations of this continued ceasefire period occurring in their respective areas.

### Lin Biao's Remarks: CCP Demands Equal Troop Ratio in Northeast

[United Press, Harbin, 5th] (Delayed) Lin Biao, Commander of the Northeast Communist Army, told a United Press reporter that the CCP has changed its previous ratio of five-to-one regarding the troop deployment issue in the Northeast and is now demanding an equal number of troops with the National Army. It is reported that this demand, as well as the issue of the communist army withdrawing from Harbin and handing over the maintenance of local order to the police, is currently being discussed in Nanjing. The communist army does not want to withdraw from Harbin, but is willing to review this issue. As for the government's request for the communist army to withdraw from major cities north of the Songhua River, such as Qiqihar, the CCP is unwilling to discuss it. Under no circumstances will the communist army want to abandon its defense area to a small area far from the railway lines. The CCP is very willing to develop the economy of the Northeast. The CCP welcomes Americans to the Northeast, just as it welcomes other countries. However, it has no intention of granting special rights to any country. He said that the CCP welcomes General Wedemeyer, the former US military commander in the China Theater, to return to China, and the CCP has a very good impression of him. When asked about the whereabouts of the commander of Changchun City and the Changchun City Defense, who were captured when the communist army captured Changchun, he only said that they were safe and sound and would be released after the government agrees to exchange them for CCP political prisoners in the future.

### Part of the Communist Army in the Henan-Hubei Border Area Moves Eastward to Attack Lihuang; The Vanguard Is 50 Li Away from Lihuang City

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] According to claims from the CCP side, the "situation is unclear" in Xuanhuadian, the base area of the Central Plains Communist Army, and it is said that the national army has strengthened its blockade of the southern section of the Ping-Han Railway, from Xinyang to Wushengguan Guangshui on the Guilin line, so the communist army can no longer move freely. However, according to military personnel who came here from Zhengzhou today, Li Xiannian, the communist army originally stationed in the Luoshan Guangshan Xuanhuadian area, has almost completely fled westward. His intention is obviously to destroy the southern route of Ping-Han, threaten Zheng-Han, and take the opportunity to coerce the people, plunder materials, and flee to the border area of Jiangsu and Shandong to join forces with Chen Yi's communist army in order to make a big move. If this plan fails, they will invade Xiangfan to the west and flee to central Hubei. The so-called "situation is unclear" in Xuanhuadian is nothing more than this.

[Central News Agency, Hefei, 6th] The New Fifth Division of the Communist Army, under Li Xiannian, advanced in the east and west directions from the western foothills of the Dabie Mountains in the Henan-Hubei border area on the first day of last month, heading towards the Ping-Han Road and invading the Dabie Mountains to the west. The more than 5,000 troops that invaded the east, commanded by Zhang Tixue, are attacking Lihuang, the core area of the Dabie Mountains.

The Xinxiang Executive Group went to investigate but was refused entry.

### Receiving and Investigating Group Formed; Heads of Each Group Designated and About to Depart; Committee Members Remaining in Beijing Meet Yesterday to Discuss Progress

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] The Receiving and Handling Enemy and Puppet Material Investigation Group, composed of representatives from the National Political Council, the Central Supervisory Committee, and the Control Yuan, has recently formed 7 regions and 16 groups, which will soon begin work, and will depart in groups before the 20th of this month. The heads of each region are listed as follows: (1) Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Region: Zhang Zhiben (2) Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi Region: Qiu Ao (3) Guangdong and Guangxi Region: Undecided (4) Hebei, Chahar, Rehe, and Suiyuan Region: Li Sicong (5) Shandong and Henan Region: Guo Zhongwei (6) Fujian and Taiwan Region: Liu Wendao (7) Northeast Region: Qian Gonglai. The group has also established a joint office in Beijing, composed of three representatives from each of the three parties, and Mr. Shao Lizi is responsible. At the beginning of its work, it will first encourage people to report secrets, and then require the receiving agencies to submit original registers within a limited time, and then decide whether to conduct a full investigation or a partial spot check.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] The committee members of the Receiving and Handling Enemy and Puppet Material Investigation Group in Beijing held a meeting this morning at the National Assembly Hall to discuss the progress of the investigation work. Secretary-General Shao Lizi of the Supervisory Committee, Secretary-General Li Chongbao of the Control Yuan, Secretary-General Di Ying of the Central Supervisory Committee, and committee members in Beijing such as Zhang Zhiben and Fan Yusui attended, and Secretary-General Jiang Menglin and Deputy Commander-in-Chief Chen of the Ministry of National Defense were invited to report on the process of handling the receiving work. Mr. Jiang pointed out the shortcomings in handling the receiving work at that time, stating that the various ministries and commissions of the central government separately sent personnel to various places to receive, and the local agencies also requested to participate in the receiving work. As a result, the authority was not unified and there was a lack of close contact, which led to malpractices. After the reports of Mr. Jiang and Mr. Chen, they both promised to provide as much material as possible for the future investigation work. Subsequently, the committee members successively expressed their opinions on the review of the receiving work in the past and the steps for the investigation group to proceed in the future. They all believed that there were many malpractices in the receiving work in the past, and the reason was that the responsibilities of the various departments for the receiving work were unclear, and there was no unified receiving organization. The various agencies only knew to dispute the acceptance and sealing of materials, which led to disputes between administrative agencies and military agencies, disputes between central agencies and local agencies, and the sealing of materials without utilization, resulting in mold and even theft of treasures. The committee members all believed that it was urgent to investigate the responsibility. As for the progress of the investigation work, most advocated first tracking down the original registers (i.e., the registers handed over by the Japanese), detailing the quantity of received materials, the amount of loss, and investigating the responsibility. However, it is reported that the previous original registers were originally scattered in the enemy's liaison management office, the Executive Yuan, and the Army Headquarters, and have been lost. In order to conduct a thorough investigation, the committee members suggested that if there is no original register, people should be encouraged to report secrets, and the method is either for people to secretly report to a joint office of an agency (the National Political Council, the Central Supervisory Committee, the Control Yuan) or to report to the local investigation group. Secretary-General Shao also suggested that for the receiving materials that cannot be used due to the Audit Law and have been spoiled, it is hoped that the committee members will discuss with the Audit Department to determine a flexible method, such as bidding or utilization. Furthermore, questions about the powers of the review group and the investigation technology were also discussed at today's meeting, and it was decided that when the groups return to Beijing after completing the investigation in the future, a plenary meeting should be convened to make a general review, and the government should be advised on its conclusions. It is learned that the group is scheduled to depart for various places to work before the 20th of this month.

It is heard that this proclamation has been forwarded by the Ministry of National Defense to the military officers' associations throughout the country.

### Clearing the Pseudo-Central Reserve Bank; Deposits Have Been Investigated; Non-Enemy/Puppet Funds Can Be Returned

[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] The "General Office for Clearing the Pseudo-Central Reserve Bank" was established in Nanjing by the Ministry of Finance, with Director Bi Delin Wang Chi in charge of the clearing process. After four months, the various deposits of the Reserve Bank's various units concentrated in Nanjing (in addition to the Nanjing Main Branch, there are the Zhenjiang, Wuhu, Xuzhou, Suxian, Yangzhou, Wujin, Taixian and other seven branches) have been investigated. Apart from enemy/puppet deposits that will be dealt with separately, non-enemy/puppet deposits and bank drafts can be returned to protect the rights and interests of depositors. In addition, deposits in the pseudo-Central Reserve Bank in various regions and remittances are currently being investigated and will soon be announced and start to be returned. The procedures are as follows: (1) The pseudo-bank units returning deposits are the Nanjing Main Branch of the pseudo-Central Reserve Bank, the Xuzhou Branch, the Suxian, Wuhu, Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Taixian, Changzhou, and six offices. The deposits of households in the five units of Bengbu, Anqing, Haizhou, Huaiyin, and Lianyungang should be announced and returned after centralized clearing. (2) The scope of deposit returns: (A) deposit reserve funds of financial institutions, (B) interbank deposits, (C) time deposits, (D) special time deposits, (E) current deposits, (F) bank drafts, and other six types. The aforementioned deposit reserve funds of financial institutions shall be applied for return only after government agencies have clarified that the bank or firm has not engaged in any rebellious activities and have proven that the debts of each bank or firm have been cleared up to 80%. As for interbank deposits, government agencies should also prove that they have not engaged in any rebellious activities before they can apply for return. If they have already obtained the proof of return of the aforementioned reserve funds, they can be exempted from obtaining proof again. (3) Each depositor (including bank draft holders) shall apply for the procedure by first obtaining an application form from this office, filling it out according to the format, and submitting it together with the original deposit book or check bank draft of the pseudo-bank (if the original seal is retained, the original seal must still be used) to the office for verification. The amount of the deposit returned shall be based on the records in the pseudo-bank's books. If there are any errors, they will be verified separately. If the deposit book or seal is lost, the loss shall be reported in the newspaper in accordance with bank practice. (4) Depositors who are far away in other counties and find it inconvenient to come to Nanjing to apply may issue a letter of authorization (if a seal is retained, the original seal should be used on the letter of authorization) to authorize a business or individual in Nanjing to apply on their behalf. If there is no one to authorize, they can directly contact the General Office by letter. (5) For the sake of prudence, the General Office requires each depositor to prepare a guarantee when withdrawing deposits, in addition to completing the application procedures. The depositor shall fill in the guarantee and send it to the office. However, if the documents are complete and there are no other doubts, the guarantee may be waived. (6) All deposits shall be paid in legal tender at the prescribed ratio. (7) The deadline for returning deposits is two months from today.

### Collection of Land Tax in Kind to Be Implemented Starting This Month; Collection Methods Are Specified

[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] The collection of land tax in kind will continue to be carried out separately starting this month. For land taxes that have been approved by the central government for various provinces, cities, and counties, and for land taxes that have been reported and revised, the principal and supplementary taxes will be collected together. Land tax will be collected in kind across the board. In special circumstances, local governments may submit a request to the Executive Yuan for approval to collect in national currency at local market prices. Cities and counties that have legally opened land taxes may also collect in kind in agricultural areas.

If a place does not produce rice or wheat, the provincial or municipal government may request the approval of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Food to collect miscellaneous taxes instead. The collection in kind shall be based on the tax amount recorded in the registers of various provinces, cities, and counties. It is stipulated that in rice-collecting areas, 4 shi dou of rice shall be collected for each yuan of tax, and in wheat-collecting areas, 2 shi dou and 8 sheng of wheat shall be collected for each yuan of tax.

A progressive method may also be adopted. In addition, approval may be obtained to collect public grain for provinces and counties, not exceeding 30% of the amount collected in kind. The tools for inspecting and accepting in kind may use the market stone and market dan as units of calculation. Collection shall be conducted once a year in principle, and shall be handled by the land tax management agencies of counties and cities. The land tax shall be collected from the land owners. If there is land that has been leased, the tax shall be collected from the lessees.

It is learned that the Direct Taxation Bureau of Nanjing City collected a total of 1.14 billion yuan in direct taxes from January to April.

### Photographs of the Enshrinement of the National Father's Corpse Submitted by Traitor Chu's Wife to the Jiangsu High Court; Nanjing High Court Yesterday Tried Traitor Pan Yugui; Traitor Guo Xiufeng Sentenced to Life Imprisonment

[This Newspaper's Suzhou Dispatch, 6th] At 10:00 a.m. on the 6th, the Jiangsu High Court received a renewed petition from Chu's daughter, Meng Yuan, submitted by her mother, Chen Shunzhen, wife of traitor Chu Minyi, requesting the rejection of the appeal. It was a defense against the talks of Zou Lu and Bao Wenzhi of Xiehe Hospital. Attached to the petition was a book of photographs of the actual enshrinement of the corpse, with a total of 30 frames, all taken by the Japanese along the way; and a copy of the process of moving the remains written by traitor Chu, which stated that the corpse of the National Father was originally stored in bottle number 294 in the laboratory of Xiehe Hospital, and attached pathology medical tissue sections and wax blocks of the corpse. After being respectfully welcomed to Beijing, it was enshrined in front of the National Father's reclining statue in the mausoleum. The sections and wax blocks were preserved in the Bi Radium Sanatorium in Shanghai for Tang Yuhan to study the treatment of liver cancer for his reference, and were not recovered until the victory of the War of Resistance. The article also stated that the medicine used to soak the corpse must be replaced every two or three years to prevent decay. It was originally planned to replace it on last year's birthday, but it was not possible due to imprisonment. Please pay attention to it quickly, and so on. The last paragraph tried hard to exaggerate the merits of managing the mausoleum at that time, hoping to invite the government to grant an amnesty.

[This Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] The Capital High Court opened the trial of traitor Pan Yugui, the pseudo-Mayor of Tianjin, this afternoon. Traitor Pan is 64 years old, from Hubei Province, a candidate in the late Qing imperial exam, and studied in Japan. After returning to China, he served as the director of the Jinpu Railway Bureau and other important positions. When the Japanese invaders occupied my former capital, Pan immediately came out to organize a maintenance society and served as the director of the Beijing Police Bureau, colluding with Japanese special agents and Yamashita Tomoyuki. He was then transferred to Tianjin as mayor. The people of Tianjin hated him for flattering the enemy, and he was known as "traitor Cao Cao" for his cunning and belligerent nature. Traitor Pan frankly admitted his past roles in pseudo-organizations, but he tried to deny his crimes in every way. Because the judge is still collecting evidence, the retrial is scheduled for 9:00 a.m. on July 20. At the same time, the High Court also sentenced traitor Guo Xiufeng, the pseudo-director of the Central Telegraph Agency, to life imprisonment.

[This Newspaper's Suzhou Dispatch, 6th] At 11:00 a.m. on the 5th, the Jiangsu High Court publicly tried traitor Xu Gui, the pseudo-Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Government Affairs Office. When the presiding judge signed the warrant for the eighth courtroom, traitor Xu was suffering from hemiplegia and was carried to the trial by bailiffs using rattan chairs. All the details of colluding with the enemy were excuses and attempts to shirk responsibility. He insisted that Ren Yuandao was meritorious in maintaining public security in Nanjing and Shanghai, and asked the government to revoke the wanted order. He himself was responsible for the public security in Jiangsu and could not be said to be without merit. He should be given amnesty according to the Ren example. The court hearing lasted for 40 minutes, and it was announced that the retrial would be rescheduled. Traitor Xu was imprisoned.

[This Newspaper's Suzhou Dispatch, 6th] Long Muxun, a cultural traitor from Nanjing, was sentenced to 12 years of imprisonment by the Jiangsu High Court. Traitor Long was dissatisfied and applied for a retrial. He submitted a statement of reasons on the 6th, in which he defended many points of the original judgment, saying that he had flattered the rebels in writing and had served as a member of the pseudo-legislature. He considered the sentence too heavy and requested a reduction.

### Zhang Xiaolong, the Chief Devil of "76," Sent to Court

[This Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] Zhang Xiaolong, the head of the Shanghai enemy Gendarmerie secret agent and the chief devil of "76," escaped arrest in front of the Daxin Company in Shanghai in October of last year. After Zhang escaped, he hid in Jinjiang, Kyoto, using the alias Wu Yu or Zhang Jiwu, engaged in activities, and served as the warehouse director of the Zhenjiang Receiving Warehouse. Recently, he resumed activities and was assigned to an important position in the Japanese-based military station. He was finally exposed by the anti-traitor personnel and arrested in mid-June. It is heard that traitor Zhang is scheduled to be sent to court for trial tomorrow.

### "Underground Banks" in Hankou Ordered to Be Closed Down by the Ministry of Finance

[This Newspaper's Hankou Dispatch, 6th] Only 31 money shops in Hankou have been approved by the Ministry of Finance. However, recently, because of the profitable nature of lending high-interest loans, the number of unapproved "underground money shops" has been increasing day by day, reaching more than 150. The Ministry of Finance believes that they are disrupting the financial system and fueling speculation, and has telegraphed the Hankou Municipal Government to strictly ban them and order them to cease operations within a time limit.

### Editorial: Magnificent Blood! Bitter Tears! Exhilarating Sweat!

Today is a memorial day woven with blood, tears, and sweat for eight years by us Chinese people!

Today we encounter the ninth "July 7th," the "July 7th" after the victory of the War of Resistance, and we cannot help but feel a myriad of emotions. During the War of Resistance, the annual "July 7th" spurred us to shed blood and sweat to strive for victory; but today, the victory has been present for more than ten months, the fruits of victory seem to be moldy, and the future seems to be blurred again. What exactly is going on?

We know that today, all parts of the country are holding memorial meetings for the military and civilians who died in the War of Resistance, but I don't know what emotions everyone is holding when they mourn the martyrs? The martyrs shed magnificent blood and have been famous for generations, but today we only repay them with bitter tears, which is too much to say!

The martyrs shed blood and won the victory. We come to mourn them, only repaying them with tears, and we all become cowards who are not up to the task! The martyrdom and bloodshed of the martyrs has indeed fulfilled their historical mission of the War of Resistance, but the victory of the War of Resistance must be followed by the success of nation-building, and then the martyrs can rest in peace. We mourn the martyrs, we must shoulder the mission of "nation-building must be successful," and then we can be ashamed of ourselves, should we just shed tears? No, we should all sweat, shed exhilarating sweat, we must sweat for the revival of education, sweat for the restoration of transportation, sweat for the reorganization of the army, sweat for the revitalization of industry, and sweat for everything and everything for the construction of a new China. We must use the attitude of work competition, replace tears with sweat, and even replace blood with sweat, so that we can taste the fruits of victory. If we continue to mess around in the current situation, then the martyrs have already made contributions to us, and we are really ashamed of the martyrs; victory has not failed us, but we have failed victory.

On this memorial day, which is both bitter, magnificent, and exhilarating, we can't help but suppress our painful memories. When the Lugou Bridge cannons rang, the aggressive arrogance of the Japanese invaders was pressing. Our country was inferior to the enemy in everything, but with the wise leadership of the Supreme Commander, with the strategic planning of the General Headquarters, with the spirit of the national military and civilians rising up to resist the war and regarding death as home, we were able to find a way to survive in the long night of eight years with blood, tears, and sweat, and finally made the Japanese invaders surrender, unfolding an unprecedented glorious page in Chinese history. According to the report given by Mr. Deng Wenyi, Director of the News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, the total number of military and civilian casualties in the country is over ten million. This page of glorious history is really written by these millions of military and civilians with their blood. When we commemorate the "July 7th" War of Resistance, we must first sincerely mourn the millions of military and civilian martyrs, and even more repent; repent why we could not double our efforts in the middle of the ten months of victory to put the country on the road to construction, and even the common people after the disaster could not ask for a peaceful and happy life? Thinking of this, writing here, it is extremely bitter, tears and pen are together!

During the eight years, the Battle of Pingjin, the Battle of Songhu, the Battle of Taierzhuang, the Battle of Xuzhou, the Battle of Wuhan, the Battle of Changsha, the Battle of Yu-E, the Battle of Xiang-Gui, the Battle of Sui-Jin, the Battle of Dian-Mian, from the northern deserts to the southern Qiongya, the entire territory of China was half-ravaged, and the number of national military and civilians who lost their heads and shed blood is countless? When the Pacific War broke out, China was even more closely blockaded, foreign aid was almost cut off, and internal strength was gradually weakened, and the national fortune was as dangerous as a stack of eggs. But fortunately, the national military and civilians, except for a few traitors and scum, fell one after another and disregarded their lives, and finally broke through the difficulties and overcame the turbulent waves. Whenever there was a time of danger and shock, our leader often had a plan in mind, and the chance of winning was unique. The world changed in confusion, and the command was as stable as Mount Tai. The reason why China was able to turn danger into safety, turn defeat into victory, and the ancient country that had been weak for a hundred years could defeat the strong neighbor that had been reorganizing its army, was due to the spiritual appeal of the Supreme Commander, and later historians will have a fair conclusion. We have such a wise leader who has already saved the country from danger; we are even more convinced that he will be able to assess the world situation, target reality, and act with great benevolence and courage, leading China onto the road of democratic unity to lay the foundation for the country's permanent peace. I hope that all parties and factions and social elites can also have a great enlightenment, unite with one heart and one mind, no longer compete for territory, no longer possess armed forces, no longer destroy transportation, no longer treat human life as worthless, no longer obstruct the convening of the National Assembly, and no longer delay the formulation of the national constitution. Everyone should be selfless and work hard to build the country, then the military and civilians who died in the war will be able to close their eyes in peace.

China should be reborn in this War of Resistance! The power of the rebirth comes from one's own blood and sweat, and also from the assistance of the Allies. The Soviet Union issued it first, and the United States and Britain followed later. They not only gave spiritual encouragement, but also assisted in countless material strengths. Especially the United States, under the leadership of President Roosevelt, used the Lend-Lease Act to aid our military fire, train our troops, build the Lido Highway, open the Hump Route, and even send their children to fight side by side on the Chinese battlefield. And there are many volunteer warriors who, under the command of General Chennault, formed the famous Flying Tigers. The Chinese people will always remember these heroic and righteous acts of hating the enemy together. After the war ended, President Truman also decided to assist us in repatriating prisoners and overseas Chinese, and jointly controlling Japan to ensure that the enemy could no longer harm the world. At the same time, he firmly advocated military aid to China so that China could share the responsibility of maintaining peace. Marshal Marshall was even more tireless in running and mediating, hoping that China could achieve peaceful unification. The Chinese people have always emphasized good faith and harmony, and have the traditional spirit of repaying kindness with kindness. They are infinitely grateful to the allies who have shared the same difficulties, but when they look back at the status quo, they feel infinitely ashamed.

After today, we can no longer shed blood, and we don't have to shed tears in vain! We must sincerely repent before the spirits of the martyrs, summon up our courage, and everyone shed exhilarating juice, go to the countryside, go to the factory, go to the mine, go to the school, hand in hand, shoulder to shoulder, and embark on the road to nation-building! This is a meaningful commemoration of the "July 7th" woven with blood, tears, and sweat!

### Local Correspondences: Tragic Rural Scenes in Huzhou Area

[Special Correspondence from Wuxing by Our Newspaper] Since my hometown of Huzhou was occupied by enemy bandits, the farmers' suffering has been indescribable. Without experiencing it firsthand, it is impossible to fully understand the extent of their plight. Someone from Anji recounted that the enemy bandits in Anji only withdrew after the victory. In the entire county town, only one house belonging to the Cai family remained intact. Although the enemy had built over a dozen barracks, the rest was just a field of rubble, a heartbreaking sight to behold. The county government is now located in one of the better houses within the barracks area, while the county party headquarters is housed in the only remaining house belonging to the Ji family. The people are impoverished and lack even the funds to build simple thatched huts. Over the years, the mulberry orchards they had planted have all been cut down for firewood, leaving them with no means to raise silkworms. In Meixi, a major town located about twenty li (about 6.2 miles) from the city, every shop in the small market was repeatedly set ablaze by the enemy, and all the towns were destroyed. Although the bamboo in the mountains could be sold, the soaring food prices and high wages make it impossible to afford the labor of cutting and selling it. The farmers are in immense pain but are still unable to secure the distribution of relief supplies.

Kunshan: Agricultural Loans for Middle Farmers Begin Disbursement

To aid impoverished farmers, the Farmers Bank of China has launched an emergency agricultural loan program in Kunshan, amounting to thirty million yuan. After more than a month of active preparations, everything is now in place. Starting from the sixth of this month, county government and farmers' association representatives, along with Farmer Bank's supervising loan officer, Yuan Zhicong, will personally go to the farmers' associations in various rural townships to disburse the loans on-site. It is estimated that this loan program will benefit 750 farming households.

Suzhou: Militia Officer Demands Goods and Detains Township Chiefs

Huang Dezhi, the deputy leader of the First District (Urban) Self-Defense Brigade in this county, ordered his orderly to summon the township chiefs of Pingzhi, Daicheng, Dongwu, Zhonglou, Minzhi, Shuangta, and Changhong to a teahouse meeting at the end of last month. Upon arrival, Deputy Leader Huang did not attend but instead had his men "relay" a demand for daily necessities such as washbasins, towels, and straw mats, instructing them to arrange it immediately. However, the township chiefs were unsure of the required quantities and did not know where to begin. Suddenly, around 11 p.m. that very night, Deputy Leader Huang led his armed men to the homes of the seven township chiefs, guarding the front and back doors as if arresting criminals. He forced the township chiefs to accompany him, demanding the items he had requested. When this failed, Deputy Leader Huang flew into a rage and detained the township chiefs in the open-air square of Sanyuanfang. Fortunately, the district head, Shen Tao, arrived upon hearing the news and secured their release. On the fourth, the seven township chiefs jointly filed a complaint with the County Provisional Council, recounting the incident. The council, appalled by the militia officer's outrageous behavior in the heart of the urban area, unanimously resolved to send a letter to the county government demanding Huang Dezhi's immediate dismissal and referral to the court for prosecution.

Changshu: County Government Reorganizes Security Forces

Hu Yanshui, the chief of the military affairs section of the county government, reorganized the existing two companies of the county security forces into two companies and one independent detachment to better suit the actual situation. Mu Jingbin has been appointed as the captain of the first company, Huang Huaide as the captain of the second company, and Zhao Shisheng as the commander of the independent detachment. They will be stationed in the city and countryside to carry out defense duties. Furthermore, all rural townships that have not yet organized self-defense forces have been ordered to establish them by the end of this month to strengthen defense work.

Wuxi: Fertilizer Loans of Two Hundred Million Yuan

Following the conclusion of the spring sowing loans, the Farmers Bank of China is now actively preparing for fertilizer loans in various regions, with a total loan amount of two hundred million yuan. The bank has dispatched Tang Kezhou, the director of agricultural loans, to Wuxi to collaborate with Liu Hanxun, an agricultural loan officer from the local branch. They departed on the fifth to conduct surveys in various townships. Starting today, local farmers can apply for loans at the Farmers Bank office in Buhang Lane. The interest rate will range from 3.5% to 4%, depending on the loan conditions, and repayment will be due after the autumn harvest.

Jintan: Cholera Rampant, Medical Supplies Lacking

Recently, cholera has been rampant in various districts, both urban and rural, in this county. In just a few days, it is estimated that there are over 500 cases. Due to the lack of medical supplies, more than 100 people have died. There are even shocking reports of entire families of four dying from the disease. Although a health clinic has been established, limited funding hinders the progress of epidemic prevention efforts. Only fifty bottles of preventive vaccine were recently received, a woefully insufficient amount for a county with a population of over 400,000. The epidemic continues to spread, plunging the entire county into a state of dark terror.

Jiangyin: Businessman Commits Suicide with Rifle after Business Failure

Wang Puchen, a resident of the eighth household in the third Jia of the first Bao in Dongjizhen (Puxie Bridge), outside the East Gate, was 29 years old. He was married to Xu and had a son and a daughter, with another child on the way. He used to be in the cloth business, but suffered repeated losses amounting to over ten thousand yuan. After the establishment of the self-defense force, he served in the second squad and had a rifle with thirty rounds of ammunition. On the first of this month, after returning home from patrol, he suddenly contracted cholera. Despite treatment from both Chinese and Western doctors, his condition had not improved by the fourth. Puchen, distraught by his business failure, the onset of illness, and the heavy expenses incurred, with no stable assets at home, committed suicide in his room around 2 p.m. by firing the rifle under his chin. The bullet exited the top of his head, and brain matter and blood flowed all over the bed. His wife, Xu, and his brother, Xichen, rushed to the scene upon hearing the sound but found him already dead. The township chief, Gao Rongfang, reported the incident to the district government, which in turn reported it to the county. On the fifth, a judicial officer, Teng, went to examine the body, which was then claimed by the family for burial.

Jiaxing: Relief Work Team Relocates to Wuxing

The Lake Second Work Team of the Zhejiang-Fujian Office of the General Relief Administration, stationed in Jiaxing, is relocating its office to Wuxing due to the severe disaster situation in the Huzhou area. This move will facilitate closer planning of relief efforts. The team's office location has been identified in Wuxing, and preparations are already complete. All staff members will be transferred to Wuxing on the fourth to conduct their work. In Jiaxing, Pan, the accounting section chief, and Xin Liangde, along with five other staff members, will be responsible for handling relief matters. The team's former address at the Catholic Church on Yangguan Street, outside the North Gate, will remain under the team's custody as a warehouse.

Jiashan: Refugees Beg for Enemy Grain Relief

There are currently tens of thousands of refugees from Xuyi, Jiashan, Dingyuan, Sixian, Fengyang, and Wuhe counties residing in this port. It has recently been reported that the enemy grain stored in the Shanghai Bank warehouse in Hexia Town, which had been approved for distribution by the Army Headquarters, has been put up for auction. There are rumors that it will soon be loaded onto trucks and transported away, causing widespread fear and panic among the refugees. In addition to submitting petitions to various levels of government, they have formed groups to petition the Ninth District Commissioner's Office, the county government, and the county council. They have also gone to the train station to beg for the loading to be stopped and for the grain to be distributed locally for relief.

Dangtu: "July 7th" Memorial Meeting Held

On July 1st, the county government and the Party Headquarters convened various county agencies to prepare for the "July 7th" Memorial Meeting. It has been decided to establish four groups: general affairs, propaganda, consolation, and disciplinary. They will begin working immediately. It has also been decided that at noon on that day, the alarm bells will ring for three minutes to remind the public of the hardships of the war of resistance and national reconstruction.

### Foreign Minister Wang Issues Important Statement: China Should Be an Inviting Nation for Peace Conference; Soviet Representative Holds Sole Dissenting Opinion, Clearly Violating Moscow Agreement

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] Regarding the upcoming Paris Peace Conference to discuss the peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie personally delivered the following statement to the French Ambassador this afternoon, asking him to convey it to the French government, as France is the host country of the conference: "According to the Moscow Agreement of October 24, 1945, which the Chinese government has previously accepted, the peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland should be drafted by the representatives of the foreign ministers of the four powers: Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. The peace conference to discuss these draft treaties should be composed of the five countries: China, Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. If the foreign ministers' conference is based on this premise, the upcoming conference in Paris should naturally be attended by all member states of the 'Foreign Ministers' Conference,' and should not be limited to the four countries: Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. This is self-evident. Otherwise, the Chinese government will consider it a violation of the aforementioned agreement."

[Our Newspaper] London, 6th (Broadcast). Bevin met with Qian Tai, the Chinese Ambassador to France, today to discuss China's participation in the peace conference.

[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 6th (Broadcast): The Foreign Ministers' Council of the Four Powers reopened this afternoon to attempt to reach an agreement regarding the invitation of various countries to attend the peace conference. The Deputy Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers held a meeting this morning to consider the distribution of invitations and whether to attach a draft agenda. It was originally planned to submit the report to the four directors this afternoon, but according to reliable reports, they did not reach a conclusion.

[Our Newspaper] London, 6th (Broadcast): Today, the Soviet government officially announced that the main issues of the Four Powers Foreign Ministers' meeting have been resolved, and said that peace-loving people will surely feel gratified by this achievement.

[Reuters, Paris, 5th] The Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers met for over three and a half hours today to discuss the method of inviting the twenty-one nations to the peace conference and the procedural laws of the conference. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov insisted that China should not be an inviting nation of the peace conference, but only an invited nation. US Secretary of State Byrnes strongly refuted this, believing that it was completely wrong and unnecessary, and amounted to insulting China. British Foreign Secretary Bevin proposed several suggestions in order for the Four Powers to reach an agreement on the method of invitation. Regarding the procedural laws of the conference, Molotov did not indicate whether he would insist that the procedural laws suggested by the Four Powers should be binding on the other countries participating in the conference, but Byrnes stated that he would never forcibly impose the procedural laws proposed by the Four Powers on the conference. The suggestions of the Four Powers might be helpful, but the conference should have the freedom to formulate its own rules. It is reported that the Deputy Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers have already submitted a preliminary proposal for the procedural laws of the conference, the content of which is similar to the procedural laws of the Foreign Ministers' meeting. It advocates the establishment of a committee for each peace treaty, with the countries that have fought against the enemy country as members.

[Reuters, Paris, 5th] The Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers, in a state of weary fatigue, went to the Luxembourg Palace tonight to continue their meeting. The discussion focused solely on the method of opening the twenty-one nation conference, and it is expected that several other minor issues will also be resolved simultaneously. Therefore, before the Foreign Ministers' conference is extended, only the German and Austrian issues remain to be discussed. Observers here believe that the opening of the peace conference is not far off, so there may not be any progress on the complex German issue. When discussing the German issue, French Foreign Minister Bidault will surely demand that the Ruhr and Rhineland regions be separated from Germany, while US Secretary of State Byrnes will still put forward his treaty to control Germany for twenty-five years, and will call for a thorough investigation of the German issue in order to convene a special conference on Germany as soon as possible. Byrnes had also previously submitted a draft of the peace treaty with the countries, but the other three countries have not yet expressed their opinions. The most difficult issue in the Balkan peace treaty is the issue of free navigation on the Danube River. It is expected that the Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers will soon reach several agreements.

### Italians Retreat from Tenda District: Territorial Loss is Extremely Significant

[Reuters, Paris, 5th] The Tenda-Briga district has been assigned to France by the Four Powers Foreign Ministers. The authorities in the district have begun preparations for the retreat today, and Italian workers at the Tenda railway and station have also been dismissed. It is also learned that the Italian authorities have requisitioned houses in Limone Piemonte, north of Tenda, so that refugees retreating from the district can find accommodation.

[Reuters, Rome, 6th] The decision by the Four Powers Foreign Ministers to assign most of the Istrian Peninsula to Yugoslavia will cause Italy to lose an investment of 110 billion lira and 30% of Italy's coal production. The shipyards in Trieste and Fiume will also be lost. These shipyards can build 22 ships per year, accounting for 54% of Italy's shipbuilding production.

### Important Property of Germans in Austria Seized by Soviet Union; Severe Punishment for Concealing and Not Reporting

[Associated Press, Vienna, 6th] It was learned today that all important property of Germans in the Soviet-occupied zone of Austria has been seized by the Soviet authorities. The news of the seizure was transmitted by TASS, which stated that according to the order of Gugur Mozov, the acting commander of the Soviet occupation forces in Austria, the former German property should belong to the Soviet Union. The Soviet military authorities stipulated that, according to the Potsdam Declaration, the Soviet government has the right to control the assets of German commercial companies within its territory. The order also issued a warning that those who conceal and do not report German property will be severely punished. At the same time, mayors and other government officials in Austria must report German property within their regions within ten days.

### Our Country Officially Recognizes Austrian Government

[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 6th] According to an announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today, the Chinese government has recognized the Austrian government. The Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom has been instructed to contact the British government and request that it notify the Austrian government of this matter through the Austrian Ambassador to the United Kingdom.

### Coastal Defense Vessels Must Undergo Inspection Upon Import

Notification from the French Side to Our Consulate

[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 5th] The French military bureau in northern Vietnam, in order to prevent the secret import of contraband and weapons into Vietnam, has stipulated rules for the import of ships into Haiphong port. The rules were delivered to the Chinese Consulate in Haiphong, requesting the consulate to inform the various Chinese merchant ships and shipping companies. The rules stipulate: (1) Ships must obtain a permit before entering the port; (2) Ships must have a harbor pilot when entering the port; (3) Ships must be docked in the designated location and must undergo inspection.

Wherever they go, they are surrounded by overseas Chinese Boy Scouts and photographers. This is the first visit to the Philippines by our country's military. This group of air force officers, led by An Xijiu, had previously flown to Tokyo to drop leaflets and are now staying at the Ta Hu Hotel. An Xijiu and others are scheduled to send the delegation to Taiwan on the seventh.

According to an embassy official, Ambassador Gu will pay an initial diplomatic visit to Acting Secretary of State Acheson in Baoshi, or present his credentials to President Truman, which has not yet been determined. However, he indicated that he will ask the US government to schedule a date in the early part of next week after the Independence Day holiday.

### The U.S. Plans to Establish a Korean Government Unilaterally

Still hopes the Soviet Union will cooperate

[United Press, Washington, 5th] US officials announced today that the Soviet Union has ignored US appeals for cooperation in establishing a Korean government, and the US will proceed with the matter unilaterally. The commander of the US military in southern Korea is establishing institutions, hoping that Koreans will prepare to obtain complete freedom. This institution includes a clearly defined legislative branch, and all Korean political parties can compete for election as members. The institute will handle various proposals related to national issues and formulate national laws, which will take effect after approval by the US military government in the US-occupied zone. But the United States still hopes to cooperate with the Soviet Union when possible.

[Reuters, Mumbai, 5th] The Executive Committee of the Indian National Congress recently approved the resolution made in New Delhi ten days ago, accepting the long-term plan of the British delegation, but this resolution still needs the approval of the general assembly of the National Congress Committee. At that time, three hundred and ten members will be convened for a two-day meeting. Right-wing elements oppose this long-term plan, and it is believed that it will cause fierce debate. The main points of the British delegation's long-term plan are to establish an Indian Federation, responsible for handling foreign affairs, national defense, transportation and finance, while other political power will be handled by each state itself.

### British Fascists Bribed by the Devilish Mussolini: Reportedly Received US$240,000 Annually; Famous Writer H.G. Wells Writes Article Attacking Royal Family

[United Press, London, 5th] Famous writer H.G. Wells published an article today attacking the British Royal Family, saying that the former Mussolini government reportedly bribed the British Fascist leader Oswald Mosley with a large sum of money before the war, and the Royal Family should publicly state whether they were involved. Wells's move is almost unprecedented. He said: If the British Royal Family is not without a relationship to this, then the Hanoverian Royal Family should flee the country with the Italian Savoy Royal Family, allowing Britain to return to its original republican tradition. The matter of Mussolini sending Mosley a large sum of money was recently raised in the House of Commons for discussion. Wells said: There are still people in the United States or other countries who drool at the sight of uniforms and palaces; they can build a "Royal Retirement Community" in their territory for the exiled monarchs of various countries. What is the inside story of this kind of large sum of money being manipulated behind the scenes? What is the relationship between the British Royal Family and this? The pure democratic societies of the world must know this. Regarding this matter, Interior Minister Ede read two letters from the former Italian Ambassador to Britain, Grandi, to Mussolini in the House of Commons on the 6th of last month, one of which mentioned that the Italian government sent Mosley a large sum of money in 1936. According to one report: Mosley received 241,612 US dollars from Italy each year, but Mosley flatly denied this. Mosley was arrested and imprisoned during the war. Wells did not explain how the British Royal Family was involved.

[Another Dispatch] Most British people have not yet been able to read the article attacking the Royal Family written by the famous British writer H.G. Wells in the "Socialist Leader" weekly, because the weekly is currently only sold at a small number of newsstands, and the 20,000 subscribers will not receive it until tomorrow. London reporters commented: This is the most serious matter since Edward VIII's abdication. Wells's article is not in accordance with the traditional habits of the British press. The British press has never attacked the King and Queen. The British believe that this habit is very fair, because the King and Queen are constitutional monarchs and cannot respond to external attacks without government approval.

[US News Service, New York, 5th] US representative, Ebbes Teller, submitted a memorandum to the subcommittee of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission today, strongly arguing that the core of any atomic energy control system is the effective control of uranium and thorium and their radioactive derivatives worldwide. The memorandum details the US views previously presented by Baruch, the US representative to the Atomic Energy Commission. Baruch pointed out that the control and development of atomic energy must be international and should be entrusted to an agency that can be called the Atomic Development Management Office. The memorandum was drafted in response to questions raised by other representatives. The memorandum stated that any uranium or thorium falling into the hands of unauthorized persons is a threat to the entire control system, thereby endangering the maintenance of peace. The subcommittee will discuss the memorandum on Monday.

### Complex Political Situation in Indonesia; Sukarno Maintains Dictatorial Power; Anti-Government Conspiracy Foiled Again

[United Press, Batavia, 5th] Indonesian Independent Government President Sukarno convened a meeting of political and military leaders yesterday. It is said that he intends to retain the dictatorial powers he recently acquired until the cabinet can resume its functions.

[Reuters, Batavia, 5th] Indonesian Information Minister Nasir announced in a broadcast from Yogyakarta tonight: Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir's political enemies not only want to overthrow Sjahrir, but also want to overthrow Republic President Sukarno and replace him with Soviet-trained communist leader Maraga. The internal situation in Indonesia is extremely complex. It has now been found that the first Republic cabinet's Foreign Minister Subardjo was in contact with the Japanese, and Minister of Communications Abikoesno was a leader of the counter-revolution. Subardjo even wanted to seek US trusteeship of Indonesia if the conspiracy failed. This conspiracy existed as early as October last year. The actions in February this year were foiled by the authorities' counter-measures. They wanted to implement this conspiracy with the help of the military. People here now believe that Sukarno's retention of dictatorial power is to protect Sjahrir, so that he can suppress internal unrest and smoothly advance political affairs.

### Doihara Planned to Form an Autonomous Regime of Five Provinces in North China; Tanaka Continuously Confesses to Conspiracies and Secrets

Trained 2.6 Million Soviet War Troops

[Remodeling Society, Tokyo, 6th] Today, the International Tribunal continued to try war criminals. Defendants Hiranuma and Okawa Jun did not attend due to illness. After the trial began, Tanaka Ryukichi continued to answer the questions of Prosecutor Sakaitoff. The expressions of the defendants involved suddenly became tense. General Itagaki listened attentively, Sato and Ken Ding leaned forward to look, seeming to hate his talkativeness, but unable to stop him from speaking, and showed a look of excitement. Colonel Hashimoto was busy taking notes for the purpose of defense.

[Remodeling Society, Tokyo, 6th] Former Army Ministry Military Affairs Bureau Chief Tanaka Ryukichi continued to confess to the Japanese army's invasion of China conspiracy today, saying that Kenju once said, "Even if the incident occurs, the domestic situation may not support the Kwantung Army's actions. If the current cabinet opposes this move, the October 1931 incident will aim to overthrow the Japanese government to solve the Northeast incident. I strongly supported this matter." In 1943, he met Major Chō Isamu, who also said: "The incident was planned by the Kwantung Army. The Northeast problem became more dangerous due to the Nakamura Shintaro Captain incident and the Wanbaoshan incident, so we must take the opportunity to solve it thoroughly. Those who participated in the plan, the Kwantung Army was centered on Itagaki and Ishiwara, and the Japanese mainland was centered on me. He said that he completely adopted my opinions, and in the civilian sector, there was the Kawa Group supporting my opinions. The October incident was almost centered on me, but Lieutenant Colonel Ishiwara expressed his opposition. In order to drag the Army Central Department to support Manchuria's independence, we publicized that if we opposed the Kwantung Army's actions, the Kwantung Army would become independent. In fact, no one in the Kwantung Army had this idea." When talking about the opposition between the defendant Minami Jiro and Shidehara, he said: "In the autumn of 1935, Minami said to me: 'Because I made an active statement representing the army in the cabinet meeting, I often opposed Foreign Minister Shidehara, who had a negative attitude towards the Northeast problem.'"

Support Wu Peifu's Comeback

Continuing to talk about Tojo's power to rule the Northeast when he was the Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, he said: Due to Tojo's plan, the Northeast's politics, economy, and national defense developed extremely rapidly. At that time, the important personnel of "Manchukuo" could not do anything without Tojo's consent. Next, he talked about the "Autonomous Regime of Five Provinces in North China," saying: The movement started in April 1935, aiming to establish a Mongolian autonomous regime and establish an autonomous regime in North China to remove the Mongolian area. It developed rapidly from the time the "Umezu-He Yingqin Agreement" was established in June 1935. The five provinces in North China were taken over by the North China Garrison Army, and the Mongolian area was taken over by the Kwantung Army, with the aim of completing the autonomy movement. In September 1935, Major General Doihara was ordered by Kwantung Army Commander Minami Jiro to go to North China to work hard on the autonomy movement. As far as I remember, Doihara hoped to support Wu Peifu to establish an autonomous government in the five provinces, but it was unsuccessful. Later, through Doihara's efforts, two regimes were established in Hebei and Chahar provinces in November 1935. The instigators of the above-mentioned autonomy movement were Cabinet Minister Commander of the Kwantung Army General Minami and Commander of the North China Garrison Army Lieutenant General Umezu. The purpose of sending Doihara to North China was to establish an autonomous regime in North China, so that it would have close relations with Japan and "Manchukuo," so that it would be useful for anti-communism. Although Umezu allowed his subordinate Chief of Staff Colonel Sakai Takashi to carry out the autonomy movement, it was a fact that he led the autonomous regime in his official capacity. According to Doihara's report to Minami Jiro: Although the Hebei and Chahar regimes were not satisfactory, they still met the Kwantung Army's expectations. Later, Hebei and Chahar will be used as the center to expand it. From the establishment of the Hebei and Chahar regimes to March of the following year, Doihara served as an advisor to the regime in Beiping, guiding its political and economic affairs according to Japan's wishes.

Mongolian Autonomous Government

Tanaka then went on to talk about his relationship with Prince De, saying: I once met Prince De, and the purpose was to make the Outer Mongolia Autonomous Committee have close ties with Japan. With Prince De as the center, an autonomous regime was established and he was assisted in establishing the independent country he hoped for. At first, Prince De expressed his unwillingness. Until August 1935, due to Minami Jiro's efforts, they finally signed a letter of cooperation, and the Kwantung Army also agreed to provide assistance in the future. This regime is different from "Manchukuo". It is Japan's support based on Prince De's wishes, and it is not arbitrarily controlled by Japan. Minami Jiro and Itagaki are both enthusiastic supporters of the "Mongolian Autonomous Government." Tojo had nothing to do with it at the time. However, after the Sino-Japanese Incident, Tojo's troops led troops into Inner Mongolia to establish the "Mongolian Autonomous Government." Finally, he made an important testimony on the Kwantung Army's training: "Manchukuo" carried out Soviet war training for national defense, and its hypothetical enemy was the Soviet Union. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, these troops were sent to the south. The number of Kwantung Army troops trained was about 2.56 million.

[Remodeling Society, Tokyo, 6th] Tanaka confessed yesterday afternoon about the truth of the Northeast Incident, saying that the Northeast Incident was carried out according to plan and was not a sudden incident. The central figures in the plan were Chief of Staff of the General Staff Department Major General Tatekawa, Opportunity Hashimoto Lieutenant General, Chō Lieutenant General, and Dr. Okawa Shumei of the civilian sector. According to Chō and Hashimoto, the main planners of the Kwantung Army were Colonel Itagaki and Lieutenant Colonel Ishiwara. The purpose of the plan varies according to what Itagaki, Hashimoto, and Chō said. According to my subjective opinion, it was to open up the domestic situation and Sino-Japanese relations that were in a stalemate. To this end, we drove out the Northeast Chinese warlords, created a "Royal Way Paradise," implemented a "heuristic reform" in the Northeast, and made it a stable force in Asia.

Manchurian Incident Plan

Hashimoto once said, "The Manchurian Incident was planned by the Kwantung Army. I tried to correct the chaotic politics at the time and worked hard to support the Kwantung Army's actions. The October Incident was also planned with Major Chō for this purpose, but it failed. However, Manchuria's independence was successful. At first, I wanted to occupy Manchuria, but in order to avoid international friction, I thought it was appropriate to create a country. 'Manchukuo' was established as a result." Ichihashi once said: "Make Manchuria a base for the recovery of Asia." Only the Kwantung Army participated in the Northeast Incident, and its center was Itagaki and Ishiwara. Hashimoto himself worked hard to solve the Northeast problem before the Northeast Incident, and also planned the October Incident to innovate domestically. According to Major Chō: The October Incident was to assassinate politicians and establish a new government, so that the Japanese people would support the Northeast Incident. Dagawa was the chairman of the "South Manchurian Railway East Asia Economic Research Bureau" at the time. Hashimoto often talked to him about the Northeast problem and domestic innovation problems. Itagaki was the Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army at the time of the incident. Hashimoto once said that he and Ishiwara were the central figures in the Kwantung Army. They said that if the cabinet's attitude towards the Northeast problem was very soft, if they opposed their policies, they would carry out riots in Tokyo, overthrow the government, and solve the Northeast problem in one fell swoop. Itagaki's opinion was that after Zhang Zuolin was bombed to death, Sino-Japanese relations quickly deteriorated, and diplomatic negotiations made it difficult to solve the Northeast problem. Therefore, he had to use force to solve the problem, drive out the Zhang Xueliang regime, create a paradise for the coexistence and co-prosperity of all ethnic groups, make Asian countries regard Japan as an ally, and get rid of the power of the white people.

Before and After the Seizure of Shenyang

Regarding the situation on September 18, according to Itagaki, at that time, according to the opinion of Nagata Tetsuzan, 20% camps were placed; at the time of the incident, one gun was used to bombard Beidaying, and one gun was used to bombard Shenyang City. The power was very great, and the Chinese army did not make any resistance. The progress was smooth. The artillery was secretly placed in the Shenyang Infantry Battalion, and the "South Manchurian Railway" tracks were within the range of the shell. Itagaki returned to China at the time of the incident, saying that "Manchukuo" had adopted the attitude that Japan hoped for. "Manchukuo" was ruled internally by the Kwantung Army, and the Kwantung Army guided its important personnel by its "General Affairs Department," but it had to obtain the consent of the Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army. Its important economic industries were all under the control of the Japanese government, and no political parties were allowed to be established except the "Kyowa Association." Regarding national defense, Japanese generals entered the "Manchukuo Army Government" as advisors and had close ties with the Kwantung Army. When Lieutenant General Tatekawa was the commander of the Himeji Division in 1934, he talked to him about the Northeast Incident. Tatekawa said: He had expected the incident for a long time. "On September 10. 6th. If the current cabinet receives a telegram from the Shenyang Consul General. It said that the Fushun Garrison Captain said that a major incident would occur within a week, so he strongly protested to Southern Minister of Army, Southern Minister of Army sent me as a special envoy to Shenyang to stop the incident. I arrived at Shenyang on the evening of the 18th, and the Kwantung Army, fearing that it would be controlled, refused to see anyone, so Lieutenant Colonel Hanatani, the assistant officer of the "Fengtian Special Service Agency," took me to the restaurant. The sound of artillery broke out in the evening, and the prostitutes trembled when they heard it. The Eastern Army knew I was here, so it didn't matter, but the prostitutes and others were still trembling. I slept soundly for one night, and Hanatani came to pick me up the next morning. At that time, the incident had already occurred, and my mission was not completed."

The Shanghai Municipal All Sectors "July 7th" Memorial Service is held in several parts.

Wu Guozhen, Xuan Tiewu, Du Yuesheng, Pan Gongzhan, Cheng Zhonghang, Wu Shaoshu, Xu Jilun, Zhou Xuexiang, Tang Tianen, Qian Jian, and Zhou Feichen have been elected as the presidium.

If the weather is clear after the meeting, a parade will be held.

The Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department, the various party and government sectors organized by the "July 7th" Memorial Preparatory Committee, are proceeding in five groups simultaneously. All preparations have now been completed. The General Affairs Group is responsible for the municipal government and the Social Affairs Bureau, the Propaganda Group is responsible for the Municipal Party Department Youth League and the Journalists Association, the Police Group is responsible for the Garrison Command and the Police Bureau, and the Fundraising Group is responsible for the Municipal Party Department and the Local Association.

### Visiting the Atomic Bomb Test, American Congressmen Visit China, Wallace Speaks at Press Conference, Expressing Regret Over Certain Anti-American Actions

[Our Own Report] American Senators Elbert Thomas, Brewster, Butler, and Representatives Bell, Robinson, Brown, LeCompte, Miller, and Wallace, a group of nine, represented President Truman at the Philippine Independence Day celebrations. Except for Bell, the other eight arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday from Manila for sightseeing. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, at the US Information Service, Senators Thomas, Brewster, Butler, Miller, and Wallace attended a press conference. The Congressmen expressed their excellent impressions of Shanghai and their gratitude for the warm reception.

Among them, Wallace, speaking from a personal standpoint, said: "Before I came to Shanghai, I had heard that some Chinese people had anti-American actions, which has now been confirmed. I do not know the reasons for this, but in any case, this situation should not exist. China and the United States were excellent allies during the war, and I hope this can continue in the future. I also hope that those who initiated these atrocities will not forget the three thousand American soldiers still missing in China, and will not forget the contributions the United States made to China and the world during the war."

Republican Brewster stated that this issue should not be taken too seriously. The United States also has two parties that oppose each other. Even Democrats themselves disagree on President Truman's policy implementation. However, both parties absolutely agree with the foreign policy of President Truman or the late President Roosevelt, and have great confidence in Marshal Marshall. The purpose of American troops stationed in China is to help China eliminate the crisis of war. As for the various external propaganda, I believe they are all exaggerated. The rumor that the US government is supplying the Chinese Nationalist Party with huge amounts of supplies is not true. Taking 1934 as an example, it was widely rumored that the US provided China with more than 7,000 tons of supplies, but in fact, it was only 4,000 tons. Therefore, I hope American journalists can help dispel rumors and hope that China and the United States can exchange personnel and visit each other in the future, not only benefiting both countries but also increasing understanding and jointly promoting world peace in both economic and construction areas.

Miller, who grew up in San Francisco, is particularly interested in China and said that they participated in the Philippine Independence Day celebrations. He feels that the United States has sympathized with the Filipino people for 46 years, helped the Philippines fight for freedom, and fulfilled its promise of independence. This shows the spirit of cooperation between the United States and Far Eastern countries in the future. Butler also said that although this is his first visit to China, he is not coming as a stranger. Although China and the United States are far apart, with the development of transportation, coming and going is not a problem. He hopes that China can develop transportation so that anyone can go to the United States.

On the way to the Far East, the congressmen visited the atomic bomb test and believed that although the test was not as successful as expected, the threat of atomic power cannot be denied. When they observed, they were ten miles away from the explosion site, so they could not make an accurate judgment. The height and size of the bomb were unknown. The second test will be on July 25, and further results are expected.

Thomas and others are scheduled to go to Beijing at 9:00 AM this morning to have lunch with Marshal Marshall and then fly to Beiping for a one-day and two-night stay before returning to the country via Tokyo.

### Northern Railway Station Epidemic Prevention Injections Reached 14,000 Yesterday

### Head of the Egyptian Cotton Industry Inspection Team, Ma Hua, Speaks

[Our Own Report] The Egyptian Cotton Industry Inspection Team, a group of six, flew to Shanghai from Calcutta on the 3rd and stayed at the Cathay and Metropolitan Hotels. They have been visiting people in the textile industry to exchange opinions and have repeatedly discussed with the China Textile Corporation. The head of the team, Ma Huadi, met with reporters yesterday morning and first stated that he was not the Egyptian Minister of Finance but only a member of the Ministry of Finance. He then described the mission, saying that the purpose was to investigate the needs of China's cotton textile industry after the war and to assist its revitalization. Ma praised the excellence of his country's cotton varieties, saying that cotton is Egypt's most important agricultural product and the cornerstone of the Egyptian economy. Its output is almost 80% of the world's total output. He also said that the first batch of Egyptian cotton after the war arrived in Shanghai ten days ago. However, the discussions with the China Textile Corporation have not yet yielded results because Egyptian cotton is much more expensive than Indian and American cotton and is not suitable for the needs of China's textile industry due to its shorter fiber. The Egyptian Cotton Inspection Team also had discussions with the local Textile Industry Association yesterday afternoon and is scheduled to return to the country next Thursday.

However, according to Jiang Wenqing's confession, what he sold was "Winter Frost Rice," which was collected from Wuxi and cost 58,000 yuan per dan, plus water and transportation costs, so the cost was very high. It is now known that the police station has reported to the higher authorities for instructions on how to handle the matter.

### The Sweetness of Sugar, The Untold Suffering

Is it a "Monopoly?" Is it "Profiteering?" A Pound for 2,000 Yuan is Quite Frightening

[Our Own Special] The sweetness of sugar contains untold suffering. The 250 sugar shops and retailers in Shanghai that have joined the Sugar Industry Association are complaining about the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, which currently controls the production and sales of sugar and monopolizes Taiwan's "Medium Sand," controlling the rise and fall of prices. They worry that if this continues, Shanghai sugar merchants will collapse.

The sugar merchants blame the Taiwan Sugar Company for "not selling goods," so that the market price of more than 60,000 yuan per dan before the company was established has now risen by more than 50% (yesterday's market was 100,400). The Taiwan Sugar Company attributes the price increase to the sugar merchants, saying that they are "profiteering, although it has not yet been clearly pointed out that there is bound to be speculation and hoarding."

This dispute quickly attracted the attention of all parties. It is said that Premier Song and Resource Committee Zeng and other responsible authorities met again last night to discuss reasonable ways to regulate production, transportation, and sales relations, and to lower sugar prices.

The Taiwan Sugar Corporation is a joint venture between the Resource Committee and the Taiwan Administrative Governor's Office. The export of Taiwan sugar and its distribution and sales in Shanghai are the business of this state-run agency.

The Taiwan Sugar Corporation was established on May 1. At that time, it received 150,000 tons of "Medium Sand" and 90,000 tons of raw materials for manufacturing sugar from the "Taiwan Sugar Industry Takeover Committee," which originally managed the cooperative sugar. Due to the lack of transportation, they ship about 10,000 tons of sugar to Shanghai every month. This amount is actually sufficient for consumption.

Shanghai is the center of distribution of sugar in the country. The monthly sales volume is about 12,000 tons. The city consumes 30%, and about 70% is transported to other places such as Pingjin, Beijing, Hankou, and Suxi. China's sugar requirements mainly come from two sources: Java and Taiwan. Although the Philippines and Brazil also produce sugar, the former has to supply the United States, and the latter is too expensive to be sold to China. Even Taiwan sugar, before the war, was also unable to compete with Java's "Dutch sugar" because the price was 1 or 2 US cents higher per pound. However, the war destroyed most of Java's 125 sugar refineries. In the future, China's sugar consumption will depend entirely on Taiwan, and this Taiwan Sugar Corporation will become the sole master of all sugar consumers in China.

When the Taiwan Sugar Corporation opened on May 24, it sold the first batch of Taiwan grain to formal sugar merchants and consumer cooperatives that had applied, at a price of 66,000 yuan per ancestor (the market price at the time was 70,500 yuan), totaling 1,000 tons. After that, a batch was sold every week, and the quantity and the duty supply were not much different from before. Until the fourth period, the market price rose to 81,000 yuan, and the company's selling price also rose to 73,000. At this time, rumors arose that distribution would be stopped.

Very clearly, prices started to rise from the fourth period. On June 20, the Taiwan Sugar Corporation directly sold 300 tons on the market, and the price rose to 98,000 yuan. The next day, the market softened, thinking that the company would continue to sell to depress prices, but the price was still 98,000, and the quantity was reduced to 200 tons, so the market price returned again.

It is said that the Taiwan Sugar Corporation sets its selling price according to the market price, giving merchants a 99% discount per dan, removing two pounds of bag skin, and allowing a profit of 15%. The sugar merchants also seem to have difficulties. The black market discount interest rate is as high as 20%, plus the cost of the dock, etc. The current purchase price of the so-called "road goods" ordered from the company is 98,000 yuan, plus expenses, and sold for 100,400 yuan, no wonder they are complaining. Hoarders can certainly get huge profits, but the sugar merchants defend themselves and say: "Our working capital is not enough, how can we hoard large amounts?"

The sugar merchants also said: "The cost of Taiwan plus transportation costs is only about 50,000, but now it is sold for 100,000. Isn't the profit made by the company? We would rather the company set the price low and make less money." They frankly said: "Official institutions are not willing to gradually depress prices. We are merchants. Don't we want to seek profit from our capital?"

The Taiwan Sugar Corporation attributes the lack of goods to the lack of ships and the reason for the market price increase, saying: "From the fourth period, the truth about the inventory was revealed, and the market raised prices together." Who raised whose price has been disputed until now.

Today's Taiwan Sugar Corporation and sugar merchants seem to be opposed to each other on the two cliffs of a deep valley, pointing fingers and glaring angrily. This one says: "You are profiteering!" That one says: "You are monopolizing!" - People who are eager for sweets are holding a confused heart and looking up at the sugar price of 2,000 yuan per pound with admiration. (Zhong Shi)

### The First Batch of Deported German Nationals, More Than 700 People Leave Shanghai Today, Schuster and Others are Expected to be Exempted from Deportation, Several People Who Did Not Report Have Been Arrested

[Our Own Report] The first batch of German nationals to be deported from the city totals 738 people. Except for 12 people who did not report yesterday, all of them boarded the American warship "Robin" yesterday, preparing to leave Shanghai at 5:00 AM this morning. The list of evacuees also includes 57 people from Guangdong, Hankou, Beijing, and Jinan. Before leaving the concentration camp, customs personnel were responsible for checking them one by one, and the order was good. The authorities are stepping up their search for the 12 missing people. As of late last night, several people had been arrested. It is learned that among the German nationals who have boarded the ship, one child died a few days ago, the cause of death is unknown. It is rumored that several other children have also contracted whooping cough, which is likely to spread, but the patients have been isolated. Also, the list of evacuees includes Ernst Schuster and his wife, Em sLund and his wife, and Michael von Hasel. These people have been represented by American lawyer Errmann, who has applied to the local court for a subpoena to investigate if they are anti-Nazi in order to avoid deportation. It is said that Errmann has inquired with the US State and Army Departments in the name of these people, and both have proven that they are not related to the Nazi elements. Schuster has been traveling in China for 21 years. He once served as the general manager of Cosmos Paper Company. In 1937, Schuster applied for naturalization as an American citizen, but it failed due to the outbreak of the war. During the war in Shanghai, Schuster helped this newspaper transport hundreds of orders of newsprint in the Yangshupu area. Hasel has been identified by UNRRA as a political refugee during the Bush regime and is known for his anti-Nazi stance. Chiang Tingfu, Director of UNRRA, has also issued a letter to prove this.

### Distribution of Rice and Grain, The City is Divided into 32 Districts, The Price of White Rice is Set at 51,000 Per Stone

[Our Own Report] The Shanghai Rice Shop Association held a joint meeting of directors, supervisors, and representatives of rice shops in various districts at the Rice Industry North Market at No. 212 Kulun Road at 2:00 PM yesterday. More than 40 people attended, and the following resolutions were made: (1) In the future, the distribution of rice will be based on the 32 district units into which the city is divided, implementing a district distribution system. Each day, several districts of rice shops will be distributed to sell rice. All member rice shops in the districts on duty will have rice to sell on that day to avoid citizens running around looking for it. (2) The rice shops will be divided into two grades, A and B, according to the amount of sales in the past. Grade A will be allocated 20 stone per day, and Grade B will be allocated 13 stone. (3) The prices of the allocated rice sold by each rice shop must be uniform. The price of Yue rice and white rice is 51,000 yuan per stone, and the price of Gan rice is 47,000 yuan per stone. (4) Please ask the municipal government to set up a rice price review committee as soon as possible in order to encourage grain merchants to go to the production areas to purchase rice and sell it in Shanghai at a reasonable price.

Also, the price of rice in the production area is higher than that in Shanghai. Therefore, most rice merchants cannot transport it. It is said that the establishment of the rice price review committee is to encourage rice merchants to go to the production areas to purchase rice. The committee will determine a reasonable price based on the purchase cost, and then the rice merchants will supply and sell it at the price. It is now learned that some rice shops have purchased rice and transported it to Shanghai. However, since the rice price review committee has not yet been established, the selling price cannot be determined. On the one hand, customers are rushing to urge purchases, so they feel very distressed. Yesterday, the Taishan Rice Store on Henan Road was reported for selling its own white rice at a price of 66,000 yuan, and the rice industry pointed out to reporters that this was a major example of distress.

[Another Report] The newly established Grain Section of the Social Affairs Bureau started its work the day before yesterday. According to Section Chief Ji Mingzhai, the most important task of the section is to distribute rice to each rice shop. In order to completely solve the rice shortage, the government and rice merchants must cooperate effectively.

### Shanghai's Financial Account, Surplus in April, Deficit in May

[Our Own Report] According to Qian Jianfu, Chief Secretary of the Finance Bureau, the city's financial statistics show a loss of 200 million yuan in March, a surplus of 2.7 billion yuan in April, and a loss of 2.5 billion yuan in May. Among them, April's performance was the best, mainly because April is a peak month for tax revenue, and the situation in all aspects was tense at the beginning of the new mayor's term. The reason for the worst performance in May was that the summer season arrived, the weather was hot, and the business of amusement parks and restaurants was light. Therefore, the tax revenue for the next three months may not be optimistic, so the city's financial income will inevitably be less than expenditure. Although the central government changed the revenue and expenditure system and allocated some direct tax deductions to the local authorities, many taxes have not yet been levied (such as land tax), and many taxes have not yet been transferred (such as business tax). Therefore, the city's financial difficulties have not been resolved. As for the central government's promulgation of the increase in the treatment of civil servants, the funds will be allocated by the national treasury in June, and from July, the municipal finance bureau will bear the burden. When asked by reporters how the current finances compare with the former British Concession Bureau, he replied: The former British Concession Bureau also had annual losses, which were made up for by issuing public bonds. However, the current municipal finance bureau has no right to issue public bonds, so its own difficult situation cannot be resolved by itself.

### Fake Ministry of Finance, Political Vice Minister Yan Jiachi's Case Closed: Bent Back and Stooped, Helped to the Court; Standard Article Praising Underground Work

[Our Newspaper's Report] Wang Zhisan, the former director of the Enemy Property University and the political vice minister of the puppet Ministry of Finance, Yan Jiachi, underwent the final interrogation yesterday afternoon at the Special Criminal Court of the High Court. According to Yan, he originally suffered from heart disease, with attacks lasting only three to four minutes each time. After being imprisoned for nine months, the illness has worsened, with attacks lasting three to four hours, posing a constant threat to his life. Yesterday, when he appeared in court, Yan was bent over, coughing frequently, his hair gray, his face gaunt, and he held a bamboo-ribbed fan. He was helped to the court by a bailiff. He spoke only a few words before shouting that he was thirsty and unable to speak. He asked for a glass of water, took a sip, and then continued to answer questions. His defense consisted of three points: (1) The puppet Huaxing Bank was negotiated and established by the rebel Chen Jin and the enemy's Zhengjin Bank. He did not hold any position, so the charge of "issuing counterfeit currency to disrupt finance" rests with the rebel Chen, not the defendant. The defendant made every effort to prevent the issuance of "Huaxing Coupons," ultimately preventing their circulation. (2) The transportation of salt in the occupied areas was originally under the control of the Japanese Navy. The defendant promoted the cancellation of this control. (3) The defendant believed that open opium smoking was detrimental to the nation's vitality and extremely harmful. He urged a strict ban and paid attention to it. In addition, He Shizhen, a special commissioner of the Military Affairs Commission, testified that Yan did indeed contact the central government to rescue underground comrades. After the defendant's lawyer defended him, the court announced the end of the debate and scheduled the verdict for 9:30 a.m. on the 13th of this month. In addition, Gu Jiren, the deputy director of the business office of the puppet Rice Control Association, was also tried and his verdict was scheduled for the same time.

### University Eye Medicine Publisher, Wu Zhisan, Retried

[Another Report] The director and general publisher of the American Chemical Factory, accused of providing alcohol produced by the factory to the enemy, was retried yesterday. After questioning the witness Uetani Kisaburo, the case was adjourned for further questioning. In addition, Wang Weicai, the puppet chief of the 15th Bao in Longhua Town, relied on enemy power to oppress civilians. Fan Rixin, an intelligence agent of the puppet Special Service Headquarters, colluded with the enemy to arrest our underground workers Zhang Wang and others. The cases of Wang Shuxian, a director of the puppet China Shipping Company, and Yu Jianmin and Gu Guoxiong, suspected of being traitors, were all brought up for questioning and adjourned for further trial. In addition, the cases of Pan Sansheng and Lu Falang, two traitors, were originally scheduled for questioning yesterday, but were postponed because the witnesses did not arrive.

Madame Chiang came to Shanghai a few days ago to raise funds to relieve Northeast refugees. At 5:00 p.m. yesterday, she convened a meeting of the Standing Council of the Northeast Refugee Relief Association at her residence at 9 Dongping Road to discuss relief measures. More than a dozen people attended, including Mo Deyuehui, Zhou Zhirou, Yu Hongjun, Xu Kan, Yu Bin, Kong Xiangxi, Fu Rulin, Qian Xinzhi, Pan Changyou, Huang Renlin, Du Yuesheng, Xu Jilong, and Wang Xiaolai. The following resolutions were made on the spot: (1) The original fundraising target for relieving Northeast refugees was 100 million yuan, but it has now exceeded this amount by more than double, totaling over 220 million yuan.

### Mo Deyuehui Comforts Northeast Refugees in Shanghai Yesterday

[Our Newspaper's Report] After arriving in Shanghai yesterday morning, Mo Deyuehui visited Ding Guitang, the Deputy Director-General of Customs, and Wang Shusen, the representative of the Northeast Relief Branch.

There are about 8,000 refugees in Xuzhou, and their current living conditions are extremely difficult. They are preparing to transfer to Shanghai and then return to the Northeast. The authorities are trying to find housing for them as a short-term stopover.

### Shipping Industry Association Discusses Carrying Relief Supplies, Establishes a Relief Transportation Group to Manage Transportation and Distribution Matters

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Shipping Industry Association held a meeting of the industry at the Hong Kong Road Bank Club at 3:00 p.m. yesterday to prepare for the transportation issues after the Executive Yuan cancels the British ship leasing contract. Representatives from various shipping companies, including Cheng Yuqi, Huang Jiaqiu, and Li Yunliang, and more than 50 others attended. Li Yunliang first reported on the various concrete measures taken to request the government to safeguard navigation rights and the shipping industry. The industry unanimously expressed respect for President Song's adoption of public opinion and assistance in the construction of the shipping industry. They also unanimously resolved the measures for carrying relief supplies. The Shipping Industry Association will establish a Relief Supply Transportation Group, abbreviated as the Relief Transportation Group. The association will appoint three representatives, and the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Executive Yuan will each appoint one representative to form a Relief Transportation Committee to decide on issues such as the transportation of relief supplies and the allocation of ships. A director-general and several staff members will be appointed to be responsible for handling the matter. Shipping companies will also need to sign letters of commitment, stating that they are willing to transport relief supplies to assist in the relief and rehabilitation work and safeguard China's navigation rights. Because Taikoo and Jardine ships have withdrawn from the coast, the Coastal Shipping Industry Conference has been formed to reorganize business and allocate routes, in order to maintain traffic on the South China and North China routes. This organization, together with the already established Yangtze River Navigation Industry Conference and the Shanghai-Suzhou-Zhejiang-Fujian Shipping Industry Conference, constitutes a more complete shipping organization. The shipping industry also discussed in detail President Song's support for purchasing a large number of ships and allocating them to various routes to replace the pre-war Japanese position in the Far East shipping industry, and a special committee was established to plan specific measures and business plans.

### Taikoo Jardine

Reorganization Unlikely to Materialize

According to Li Yunliang, Secretary-General of the Shipping Industry Association, President Song's approval of the opening of four ports for trade this time is purely to facilitate the transportation of goods. However, in response to the shipping industry's request, Wuhu and Jiujiang, two of the four ports, have been cancelled, leaving Nanjing and Hankou to meet special needs. The so-called special need is that the port of Shanghai is too crowded, and two ports have to be opened to facilitate transportation. However, the shipping industry is still requesting President Song to consider carefully. Regarding the reorganization of Taikoo Jardine into a Chinese-owned company, Li believes that it is just a rumor and is unlikely to materialize.

### Inaugural Meeting of the Press Association

### Third Trial of the Sensational Corpse Case, Lin Buwu Testifies: Hated Her Arrogance

Verdict Scheduled for the Thirteenth

[Our Newspaper's Report] The sensational corpse case at the Mount Tai Apartment was heard for the third time in the local court yesterday morning. Presiding Judge Cao Zuwei interrogated the murderers Lin Buwu and Wang Zhengzhong. Xie Yaoting, a lawyer, provided pro bono defense. The court scheduled the verdict for 9:00 a.m. on July 13. Xue Tingfang, the lover of the deceased Chen Huifang, and the wife of the main culprit Lin Buwu, were present in court. Lin's wife was holding a four-month-old baby, looking at her husband and the baby from time to time, with red eyes, and was very anxious. Lin testified again: He shot Chen Huifang at the time because Chen's attitude was arrogant and he was stimulated, which led to the confusion and accident. It was not intentional murder because he failed to snatch the ring on Chen's hand. He said: "My family is not that bad, I wouldn't be moved to kill for a ring!" Presiding Judge Cao further questioned: "According to the police investigation of the case file, it was found that Lin Buwu had committed robbery twice, once sentenced to five years and another time sentenced to eight years, with deprivation of public rights for seven years. Wang Zhengzhong also committed one robbery and one theft. You are all old robbers!" The two criminals' faces changed when they heard this, and they remained silent. After the lawyer defended them, he said that Lin Buwu acted out of momentary anger, and the court should pay attention to the provisions of Article 57, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law, "the stimulation received at the time of the crime," and reduce his sentence. As for Wang Zhengzhong, since he did not jointly commit the crime, he should not be regarded as an accomplice. The seizure of the ring, because the deceased's husband was a temporary spouse and not a legal heir, should only constitute the crime of encroaching on lost property, not theft.

### The 24th International Cooperative Day Was Held Yesterday, the Shanghai Branch of the China Cooperative Association Was Established Simultaneously

### Haji Yaqub Talks About the Recent Situation in Xinjiang, The First Step in Governing Xinjiang in the Future Is to Establish National Sentiment

[Our Newspaper's Report] This reporter recently visited Haji Yaqub, a representative of the National Congress from Xinjiang, and talked in detail about the recent situation in Xinjiang. The following is a brief record: Xinjiang is an important border defense area of our country. In the past, due to the government's lack of power to reach it, the relationship with the central government was quite isolated. However, it has only been noticed by the Chinese people since the War of Resistance. Judging from the current domestic political situation in our country, the complexity of the Xinjiang issue is no less than that of the Nine Provinces of the East. Most people believe that Xinjiang is a political issue. In fact, the ethnic issue is even more important than the political issue; the Yining Incident is a concrete reflection of the Xinjiang ethnic issue. The settlement of the Yining Incident is indeed the first satisfactory gain of General Zhang Zhizhong's administration of Xinjiang. However, the settlement of the Yining Incident cannot be regarded as the fundamental solution to the Xinjiang ethnic issue, and further efforts are still needed in the future. There are more than a dozen newspapers in Xinjiang Province, divided into four versions: Chinese, Uyghur, Kazakh, and Russian. The names of newspapers in various places are unified, all called "Xinjiang Daily." The circulation of newspapers has decreased sharply in recent years. Newspapers that could sell more than 20,000 copies a few years ago now only sell more than 1,000 copies. This is enough to reflect the failure of the government's promotion of cultural work in the border areas. The same is true for education. The number of students at all levels in Xinjiang Province is now only a quarter of what it was a few years ago. The reason is that former Chairman Wu advocated "assimilation policy" and "intermarriage policy," which aroused the fear and dissatisfaction of the people of Xinjiang, and they no longer allowed their children to go to school to avoid the danger of "assimilation." The population of Xinjiang Province is often referred to as 4 million people, but in reality, it is more than this number, probably more than 6 million people. Among them, the Uyghur ethnic group (the Uyghurs are the Turkic ethnic group) accounts for about 4.5 million people. The living standards in Xinjiang Province were very low before the war and in the early stages of the War of Resistance. However, in recent years, they have risen sharply and are now the highest in the country. The reason is that the population has increased sharply, resources are scarce, supply cannot meet demand, transportation is inconvenient, and the import of goods from other places is difficult.

\[Reuters, Mexico City, June 6th] It is reported that the Bank of Mexico has estimated that if the price of silver reaches US$1.05 per ounce, the total amount of silver currently held in Mexico, including private reserves waiting for export, would reach 250,000,000 ounces. The current official price of silver is US$0.7111 per ounce, with a proposed increase to US$0.9003.

### American Factories Accepting Orders for Chemical Raw Materials
Recently, raw material merchants in this city received a telegram from a major chemical factory in New York stating that orders can now be placed for "搪精福美林" (likely a brand name or type of formaldehyde), stearic acid, acetic anhydride, benzoyl, soda ash, red phosphorus, and potassium chlorate, with shipping expected in late September. It is reported that the prices for these items have already increased compared to before.

### Economic Briefs
*   A shipment of base-grade cork has arrived and is being unloaded. This is the first batch of cork to arrive since the war.

*   A portion of Wuxi silk floss has recently been transported to Shanghai for sale. Top-grade floss is priced at one million yuan per "dan" (a unit of weight), and second-grade floss at 820,000 yuan. Businesses involved are still quite active.

*   Chinese tung oil is experiencing very sluggish sales in the British market after the war. In the past, exports to the UK were transshipped through Hong Kong, and in small quantities, no more than 200-300 "dan" per month. Recently, the market has gradually become more active. Tung oil merchants are preparing for direct exports from Shanghai and have already completed deals for over 400 "dan," worth approximately £210 per ton.

*   The Agricultural Credit Bureau of China (中農) is organizing agricultural loans, and the regional divisions are as follows: In Jiangsu Province, the area east of Wuxi in Southern Jiangsu, and the three counties of Nantong, Haimen, and Qidong in Northern Jiangsu, are under the responsibility of the Shanghai branch of 中農. The Wuxi area is directly managed by the Wuxi office of the Shanghai branch. The area west of Wuxi is under the responsibility of the Nanjing branch. Agricultural loans in the Northeast are under the responsibility of the Changchun branch. All other provinces are under the responsibility of the 中農 branch located in the provincial capital.

*   Financial inspection operations, excluding the Northeast, have been widely launched across the country. In North China, Tianjin, Qingdao, Guangzhou, Hankou, and other places, inspections began on the first of this month. The inspection time in Sichuan, Kang, Yunnan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces was earlier, and is expected to be completed by the end of this month. According to the person in charge of the relevant department of the Central Bank, for any bank or firm that violates regulations in the future, the four types of penalties will still be imposed: warning, fine, suspension of business for rectification, and revocation of license.

*   In order to protect banking operations, the Ministry of Finance had stipulated that when customers withdraw funds exceeding the amount of their deposits, overdraft agreements should be signed. The financial industry submitted detailed reasons to the Ministry of Finance requesting exemption from this requirement. It has now been learned that the Ministry of Finance has rejected the request and strictly ordered all banks to comply.

### Textile Industry Opposes Disguised Increase in Electricity Rates: Coal-for-Electricity Equals More Than Double the Cost
The Joint Association of the Machine Cotton Textile Industry of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Provinces held an emergency meeting on the 5th of this month. More than 100 representatives from the association's member factories attended, chaired by acting chairman Wang Qiyu, to discuss the issue of coal-for-electricity. According to the association's report, the Shanghai Regional Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, in conjunction with the city's Public Utility Bureau, submitted a proposal to the Executive Yuan, which was approved to conduct a three-month trial run starting from June 1st. For the electricity consumption of yarn factories in the Shanghai urban area, a coal-for-electricity method will be adopted, with the Fuel Management Committee supplying coal to the yarn factories at a price of 120,000 yuan per ton, and each ton of coal yielding 600 kilowatt-hours of electricity, which equates to 200 yuan per kilowatt-hour, an increase of 114 yuan compared to the original price of 86 yuan per kilowatt-hour charged by the power company. The association unanimously believes that this coal-for-electricity measure is a disguised increase in electricity rates. Yarn and cloth are necessities for clothing, and an increase in electricity rates will increase production costs. Increased production costs will inevitably lead to higher prices for cloth products, making it even more difficult to compete with cheaper foreign goods, which is a cause for concern. Furthermore, it will also affect prices and social purchasing power. It was resolved to appoint representatives to present the industry's difficulties to the relevant authorities, requesting that the original method be maintained.

### South Africa Revalues Gold Reserves, Calculated at 172 Shillings Per Ounce

### Manufacturers Suffer Losses Due to High Costs Exceeding Silk Prices, Appoint Representatives to Seek Government Assistance, Government Agrees to Subsidize Export Sales
\[Our Correspondent] According to the person in charge of the China Silk Company, approximately 160,000 "dan" (市秤) of fresh cocoons were collected during this cocoon harvest season, estimated to yield over 10,000 "dan" (關擔) of raw silk. The purchase price for cocoons was approximately 120,000 yuan per "dan." Due to variations in cocoon quality, the purchase price for superior cocoons reached as high as 180,000 yuan per "dan," while the purchase price for lower quality cocoons was as low as 64,000 yuan per "dan." However, purchasing at these prices still results in losses for silk reeling factories, especially for lower quality cocoons. It is reported that one "dan" of dried cocoons requires 260-300 "jin" (斤) of fresh cocoons. Therefore, the cocoon cost for each "dan" of raw silk has reached 2.4 million yuan. Adding processing fees of 1.1 million yuan per "dan," the minimum cost for each "dan" of raw silk has reached a substantial 3.5 million yuan. Based on the Shanghai market price for raw silk, this already results in significant losses. Furthermore, the market price for raw silk overseas is even lower than the Shanghai market price. Therefore, it is practically impossible to export raw silk. However, raw silk is one of China's most important export commodities, and the quantity is also very large. Previously, private silk factories had requested government assistance. It is reported that Premier Song has already instructed the Ministry of Economic Affairs to review the matter. Therefore, private silk factories have recently sent representatives, including Wang Huanan and Zhou Yuanxun, to Beijing to consult with the Ministry of Economic Affairs. It is reported that the government authorities have decided to provide practical and urgent assistance for raw silk exports first, and then develop a comprehensive subsidy plan for other export industries.

### Strive for Peace and Reconstruction – Let Us Revisit the Eight Years of Arduous Resistance!
……The News Agency Reference Room……

### The Lugou Bridge Incident
The eight-year war of resistance against Japan is arguably the most magnificent chapter in the history of the Republic of China, and also the most arduous. Looking back at this period of history, we are filled with boundless sorrow, terror, excitement, and joy!

When the July 7th Incident occurred in 1937, the international situation was such that, due to the contradictions between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, and under the appeasement policy in Europe, democratic countries were retreating step by step, and fascist countries were riding high. Within China, there was a shift from "pacifying internal unrest before resisting foreign aggression" to uniting to resist foreign aggression. Although national strength was exhausted and the people's livelihood had not recovered, under the great crisis of national survival, a great will for unity and self-improvement had emerged, preparing to embark on the path of unification. Japanese imperialists, realizing this point, could not allow China to become strong through unification, and impatiently launched the war.

The "July 7th Incident," like the "September 18th Incident," the occupation of Rehe, the Suiyuan War, and the Eastern Hebei Incident, was by no means an accidental event, but a deliberate provocative action masterminded by Japanese imperialists. However, what distinguished the "July 7th Incident" from the "September 18th Incident" and the Eastern Hebei Incident was China's response. After the incident in which Japanese troops provoked a quarrel during exercises at Lugou Bridge on the night of July 7th, the Chinese government, while adhering to its love of peace, continued to negotiate with the Japanese side through diplomatic channels in an effort to achieve a peaceful resolution. However, the Japanese side, on the one hand, created obstacles during the negotiations, going back on their word, and on the other hand, continuously increased the number of troops entering customs, continued to provoke quarrels, and successively dispatched naval warships to China to demonstrate their strength. Peace was clearly not something that could be achieved by unilateral wishes. Therefore, on July 17th, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek delivered a speech in Lushan, explaining China's basic attitude of seeking self-preservation internally and co-existence externally, and clearly revealing the four minimum points for resolving the incident: "(1) Any resolution must not infringe upon China's sovereignty and territorial integrity; (2) The Hebei-Chahar administrative organization must not be subject to any illegal changes; (3) Local officials appointed by the central government, such as Song Zheyuan, Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, must not be removed at the request of others; (4) The 29th Route Army must not be subject to any restrictions in its current area of deployment." Finally, he solemnly declared: "We hope for peace, but do not seek temporary security; we prepare for war, but never seek war. We know that after the national war of resistance begins, the situation will only involve sacrifice to the end, with no possibility of escaping. If the war breaks out, then there will be no distinction between north and south, young and old, and everyone will have the responsibility to defend the territory and resist the war, and everyone should be determined to sacrifice everything." This was a solemn and sacred declaration, which proclaimed to the world, to the people, and to the enemy, the maximum extent to which China sought peace, and the final determination to fight for survival.

After this statement was issued, Japan realized that it was impossible to resolve the Lugou Bridge Incident in accordance with the incidents since the "September 18th Incident," and it actively made military preparations, replacing Tadashi Hayao with Kiyoshi Kasaki as the commander of the Japanese garrison in North China. On the 25th, Japanese troops suddenly attacked and occupied Tuanhe while our army was changing defenses. At the same time, Japanese troops departing from Tianjin to Langfang also clashed with our army. Using this as an excuse, the Japanese side issued an ultimatum to Song Zheyuan, which Cao Song Zheyuan sternly rejected. The war in Beiping expanded, and the next day Song ordered a general offensive. Thus, the Lugou Bridge Incident, which had been negotiated for more than 20 days, was completely broken. The expansion of the Sino-Japanese war from a local conflict to a full-scale war was also largely determined.

### Full-Scale Combat, Enthusiastic Unity
When the flames of war from Lugou Bridge began to spread to Peiping and Tianjin, and the national situation was still in the tense atmosphere before the storm, a full-scale war of resistance unfolded in Shanghai.

Since Japan had launched the war in North China, in order to contain the forces in Central China and to achieve its dream of a quick victory, it had to seize Shanghai, which was the economic and cultural center of China. On August 9th, it provoked the conflict under the excuse of the Hongqiao Airport Incident (Lieutenant Oyama Isao and Saito Takazo of the Japanese Naval Landing Forces stationed in Shanghai rode in a car and carried weapons in an attempt to break into Hongqiao Airport, clashing with the guards). Although the consuls of various countries intervened to mediate, the Japanese side's deliberate provocation showed no sincerity in negotiations. The so-called diplomatic negotiations were merely a cover for military deployments. By August 12th, more than 20 Japanese warships had been assembled in the Shanghai area, with tens of thousands of naval and army personnel, and 2,000-3,000 had already landed, constantly provoking the Chinese security forces. Therefore, the Chinese authorities had no choice but to temporarily and urgently transfer the 17th and 88th Divisions to Shanghai to strengthen defenses. At 9:00 AM the next day, a skirmish occurred in Zhabei. At around 4:00 PM, Japanese troops launched a large-scale offensive, bombarding with artillery, marking the start of the full-scale war of resistance on August 13th.

On August 14th, the National Government issued a statement of self-defense and resistance: "China solemnly declares today that China's territorial sovereignty has been subjected to Japanese aggression; the international covenants, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Pact of Paris have been completely destroyed by Japan. The greatest purpose of these treaties is to maintain justice and peace. China, as a matter of responsibility, should do its best to protect its territorial sovereignty and maintain the dignity of the above-mentioned treaties. China will never abandon any part of its territory. In the event of aggression, it can only exercise its inherent right of self-defense." At the same time, the Chinese Air Force took the lead in bombing enemy ships, engaging in fierce battles in the air and at sea. The citizens of Shanghai and the people of the whole country responded to the government's self-defense and resistance with enthusiastic and inspiring emotions.

The unanimous demand for unity and resistance against foreign aggression within the country gave rise to a nationwide and united war of resistance. In this full-scale war of resistance, it was even more necessary to seek national unity and consistency. Therefore, on August 22nd, the National Government officially ordered the reorganization of the Red Army into the National Revolutionary Army's Eighth Route Army, and appointed Zhu De and Peng Dehuai as the commander and deputy commander of the Eighth Route Army. Zhu and Peng issued a telegram taking office on the 25th. On September 22nd, the government issued the declaration of common commitment to national crisis, which had already been proposed by the Chinese Communist Party in July, and Chairman Chiang's speech accepting the declaration of the Communist Party. On the Communist Party's side, in order to achieve peaceful unification and unity against foreign aggression, it declared to the country: (1) Dr. Sun Yat-sen's "Three Principles of the People" are essential for China today, and the Party is willing to strive for their thorough realization; (2) All policies of overthrowing the Chinese Nationalist Party's regime through rebellion and the Red Movement are cancelled, and the policy of confiscating landlords' land by violence is stopped; (3) The current Soviet government is abolished, and civil rights politics are implemented in order to unify the national regime; (4) The name and number of the Red Army are abolished and reorganized into the National Revolutionary Army, under the jurisdiction of the National Government's Military Council, and awaiting orders to move out and assume the duties of the front lines of the war of resistance. At the same time, Chairman Chiang also expressed with extreme frankness and sincerity: "Today, all nationals who can believe in the Three Principles of the People and strive to save the country, the government will not ask about their past and will give them the opportunity to serve the country effectively. For any faction in the country, as long as they are sincerely saving the country and willing to fight together under the banner of national revolution, resistance against the enemy, and defense against foreign aggression, the government will openly accept them and concentrate them under the leadership of this Party to work together." These two inspiring documents not only demonstrated the determination of the two parties, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, to cooperate, but also consolidated the foundation of domestic unity against foreign aggression. The following year, on April 13th and 21st, the National Socialist Party and the China Youth Party also wrote to the Chairman one after another, abandoning their prejudices and jointly committing to the national crisis. At the same time, the Law on Punishing Crimes Endangering the Republic of China was abolished, and the mass anti-Japanese movement was widely launched under open and legal circumstances, which greatly boosted the morale of the early stage of the war of resistance.

### The Flames of the War of Resistance Destroyed the Japanese Army's Poisonous Plan to Conquer China in Three Months

We fought against a powerful country as a weak nation, and before the war, due to domestic and international constraints, we were unable to prepare for the war. Whether it was weapons, tactics, or strategy, we were no match for the enemy. Therefore, in the first phase of the war, we were at a disadvantage everywhere and had to use significant sacrifices to curb the enemy's advance. Then, we used a vast amount of space to buy time, resisting while preparing, fighting while training.

In particular, the situation in North China was the most disparate. Japan had long been determined to annex China. After occupying the four northeastern provinces, it created a special regime in eastern Hebei, and threatened and enticed to obstruct the construction of national defense in North China, alienating the relationship between North China and the central government, and dividing the feelings among the generals in North China. Therefore, when the Lugou Bridge Incident occurred, North China was actually in a state of semi-disarmament, and the gateways to Peiping and Tianjin were wide open. On the 28th, Song Zheyuan ordered a general offensive on the one hand, and had to retreat to Baoding on the other. Peiping and Tianjin fell into enemy hands within three days.

After the loss of Peiping and Tianjin, the war expanded, and the enemy increased its troops from three routes: the Beining Road, the Pinggu Avenue, and the Tanggu Seaport. At the same time, it launched offensives along three routes: Pinghan, Jinpu, and Pingsui, with the main force actually attacking Nankou along the Pingsui Line in the north.

Nankou is the gateway to the three provinces of Chahar, Suiyuan, and Shanxi, and occupies an important position in the military strategy of North China. Therefore, after capturing Peiping and Tianjin, the enemy immediately sent the well-equipped Itagaki Division to attack Nankou, putting our army in a rather caught-off-guard situation. On the 31st, the 23rd Army of Tang Enbo was ordered to rush to defend Nankou. Although the strength was weak, they all fought desperately with a spirit of determination. After 20 days of bloody battles, the enemy repeatedly failed to capture it, so they secretly attacked the right wing of our army, bypassed Huailai out of the Great Wall, and formed an encirclement, but Tang's army still held firm.

However, the firm defense of Nankou for 20 days was ultimately affected by the drastic changes in the battle of northern Chahar. (Liu Ruming missed our opportunity and lost Zhangbei, causing Zhangjiakou to fall to the enemy on the 25th.) After the loss of Zhangjiakou, we were in an isolated and deeply suspended unfavorable situation, and had no choice but to retreat to Juyongguan.

After the fall of Zhangjiakou and Nankou, the enemy advanced westward to Shanxi, attacking Tianzhen and Yanggao to seize Datong. Due to Li Fuying's refusal to fight, the enemy was able to quickly complete the seizure of this line of important towns. On September 13th, Datong fell, and the enemy pointed its troops southward, directly pressing on Yanmen Pass (at that time, Liu Ruming successively abandoned Yangqu, Weixian, Guangling, Lingqiu, and Laiyuan). Yanmen was abandoned on the 27th. At the same time, another enemy force occupied Xinghe from Yanggao and attacked Guisui from the Shakou of Datong, and successively occupied Pingdiquan, Bailingmiao, and Jiabusi. Therefore, in the month since the retreat from Nankou, the enemy had almost controlled the three provinces of Suiyuan and Chahar with unstoppable momentum. The only strong resistance and setback they encountered was the Battle of Pingxingguan on September 26th. Afterwards, our army used guerrilla warfare in coordination with the maneuver warfare of the main national army, almost annihilating the entire Itagaki Division, creating an unprecedented major victory on the western battlefield, and temporarily stabilizing the situation in northern Shanxi.

On the Jinpu Road, the Japanese army captured Yangliuqing on August 3rd, but was not able to mount an intense offensive due to being restrained by the battle of Nankou. The two armies of the Chinese army were quite active in counter-attacking, and the two armies remained deadlocked north of Tangguantun until early September. After September 4th, the enemy launched a fierce offensive with aircraft and heavy artillery, capturing Machang on the 11th and Xingji on the 17th. Although the two armies of the Chinese army were active, they were unable to stop the enemy's frontal offensive, and withdrew from Cangzhou on the 24th. The Japanese army then marched straight to Dezhou.

The collapse of the two routes of Jinpu and Pingsui greatly affected the offensive of our army on the Pinghan Line. First, after our army withdrew from Peiping and Tianjin, it concentrated the Liangxiang and Gaoyi counties, relying on the Liulihe to defend firmly. The two armies carried out guerrilla warfare between Fangshan and Changxindian, blocking the enemy's main force from going south. Even as late as September 13th, our army had swum across the Liulihe to engage in fierce battles with the Japanese army. However, at that time, Nankou had been lost, Datong had also been captured, and the Japanese army on the Jinpu Road had also approached Cangzhou. Our army on the Pinghan Road felt threatened on both sides. They relaunched a two-wing encirclement of the Japanese army, with the left wing capturing Gu'an and Yongqing, and the right wing capturing Fangshan. Our frontal defenders had no choice but to withdraw from Zhuozhou, and Baoding also fell into enemy hands on the 24th.

After this, the Japanese army made considerable advances in North China and Shanxi. The enemy army on the Jinpu Road captured Dezhou on October 5th, the Pinghan Road captured Shijiazhuang on October 12th, and then moved west from the Zhengtai Road through Niangziguan, pressing on Taiyuan. At the same time, the enemy army that went south from Yanmen and Tangmingbao advanced towards Yuanping and Xinkou, creating fierce battles at Yuanping and Xinkou. In the Battle of Xinkou, our army fought bravely, and Chief of Staff Hao Mengling died a heroic death, while the enemy also suffered heavy losses. On November 5th, the Japanese army occupied Xinkou, and on the 9th, they occupied Taiyuan.

After occupying Taiyuan, the Japanese army still took the main force along the Tongpu Road southward, directly taking Fenlingdu. At the same time, they took Fenyang along the Tai-Fen Highway, and seized Janshe from Heshun. However, the progress of the war was already in a considerable stalemate. The Chinese army in southern Shanxi was ordered to enter the Huai River and cross the Yellow River, launching a protracted guerrilla warfare in the river valley and hilly areas.

Unlike the long-distance progress of military operations in North China, the Battle of Shanghai was a positional battle of every inch of land, every drop of blood from the 13th of August to the 22nd of August. The initial skirmishes in Zhabei and eastern Shanghai were almost street battles, including the heroic scene of attacking the Wenzhou Wharf. On the 23rd of August, the enemy landed in Wusong, and the battle line spread outward. In order to avoid the range of the Japanese warships' cannons, our country shifted towards the so-called first line of defense on September 23rd, starting from Liuhe in the north, passing through Luodian, Liuhang, Miaohang, Jiangwan, Baziqiao, and ending at the North Station, with a total length of 60-70 kilometers. After holding out against the enemy for another month and thirteen days, the entire line was shaken by the breakthrough at Dachang. Zhabei, we withdrew to the north of the Suzhou Creek, but the eight hundred warriors of Xie Jinyuan's unit still held firm in the Four-Line Warehouse for as long as four days, and were not ordered to retreat into the concession until October 30th.

After the fall of the Yangtze River, our army again set up defenses along the line from the mouth of the Yangtze River to the Suzhou Creek. The enemy repeatedly attacked but failed to succeed. On November 5th, the enemy landed in Hangzhou Bay, and our rear lines in Pudong and western Shanghai were attacked. We had no choice but to withdraw westward, and then Nanshi became the final target of the enemy's attack. The Battle of Shanghai had reached its finale. On November 11th, our army withdrew from Nanshi, exactly three months from the outbreak of fire in Zhabei on August 13th, consuming a total of more than 100,000 enemy troops. This battle may have been a strategic mistake, because it consumed the enemy but consumed ourselves more severely, and failed to seize the initiative throughout, to the point that it affected the new line of defense in the rear. However, from the perspective of the entire strategy, the three-month Battle of Shanghai dealt a serious blow to the enemy, proving that their dream of conquering China in three months was an illusion, and giving the Chinese people profound encouragement and lessons, proving that we are capable of fighting, but the war itself is extremely arduous and must be protracted.

Since the loss of Dachang and the retreat from Nanshi, our army retreated to the so-called Su-Jia National Defense Line, starting from Hupukou in the north, passing through Suzhou and Jiaxing, and ending at Haiyan in Hangzhou. The Japanese army, on the one hand, bombarded Haiyan and Zhapu fiercely, and on the other hand, bombed Suzhou madly, breaking through the defense line, and captured Suzhou on the 19th. (Our defense was not consolidated.) The war advanced into Wuxi and Wuxing along the Taihu Lake. The enemy attempted to threaten Nanjing from the two lines of the Jinghang National Highway and the Jinghu Road. On the 30th, the Japanese navy broke through the Jiangyin blockade line, and Changzhou also fell, creating an unstoppable momentum for the enemy on the Jinghu Line. On December 3rd, Jurong fell, and four Japanese routes pressed on Nanjing. The Japanese army crossed the Yangtze River to the north, taking Pukou and Yangzhou. On the 13th, Nanjing fell, and on the 15th, Wuhu and Dangtu fell. On the 18th, the enemy settled on Jinshan, and on the 23rd, Hangzhou also fell, and our army retreated to the south bank of the Qiantang River. First, on November 20th, the government announced to China and foreign countries that it was relocating to Chongqing to engage in a long-term war of resistance. However, the rapid progress of the enemy on the Jinghu Line and the successive fall of Nanjing and Hangzhou still inevitably aroused condemnation of the government and pessimism and wavering on the war situation among people at home and abroad. Therefore, Chairman Chiang issued a special declaration on the day of the retreat from Nanjing, saying that the center of gravity for China's protracted war of resistance was not only not in Nanjing, but also not in major cities, but actually resided in the vast and strong hearts of the people in the country's villages. The people of the whole country were invigorated, and on the one hand, military deployments were reorganized, and on the other hand, solidarity was strengthened, and the gains and losses and experiences in politics and military affairs were reviewed. On January 27th of the 27th year, Han Fuju was executed for neglecting military orders and delaying military affairs, which greatly inspired the anti-Japanese soldiers and civilians. On March 29th, the provisional congress of the Kuomintang reiterated the position of uniting sincerely to overcome national difficulties together, saying that "Without unity, there can be no assurance of victory in the war of resistance and success in national construction. Without joint efforts to realize the Three Principles of the People, there can be no genuine unity." At the same time, it adopted the program for resisting the war and building the nation, determining the basic principles of diplomacy, military affairs, politics, economics, civil affairs, and education. As a result, the road to nationwide, all-round war of resistance and national construction, and ultimately to victory and success, became clearer and more steadfast. On April 12th, the organizational regulations for the National Political Council were promulgated. Although it was only a nominal advisory body of public opinion, it was already an unprecedented step forward in Chinese politics. On July 6th, the first session of the Political Council was established and convened in Wuhan, declaring its support for the National Government, support for the Supreme Commander, support for the program for resisting the war and building the nation, and resistance to the end. It also passed many proposals, such as setting up provincial and county councils and launching mass resistance against Japan. At the same time, the mass anti-Japanese movement also flourished. Military service propaganda, public bond solicitation, and donations of money and goods for consolation were all warmly welcomed. The Three Principles of the People Youth League of the whole country was also organized during this period.

### A List of Statistics, Japan Has Been Badly Hit, and Our Air Force Has Won Victory

Our country has won a great victory after eight years of war. Recalling the beginning of the war of resistance, the contrast between the military strengths of China and Japan was very large; but our military strength became stronger as we fought, while Japan became weaker and weaker. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, Japan also had to use a large number of troops to deal with the United States, and felt increasingly short of troops, eventually leading to its defeat. Conversely, during the War of Resistance, our country's army continued to increase, and its combat effectiveness became increasingly strong. Especially in the air force, it expanded even faster; so Japan was hit the deepest. Looking at the following statistics, one can get a glimpse of our battle results.

Over the past eight years, our country's air force has launched the following sorties against Japan: 3337 attacks, 20 reconnaissance missions, 151 air battles, 151 escorts, and 42 parachute troop drops. A total of 3897 sorties.

544 Japanese aircraft were destroyed by our bombing on the ground, 5 were possibly destroyed, and 120 were damaged. 5686 Japanese aircraft were destroyed in the air, 60 were possibly destroyed, and 35 were damaged.

7034 Japanese warships were sunk. 543 were injured. 16 wharves were destroyed. 530 locomotives were bombed, and 98 were injured. 40 oil tankers were bombed, and 5 were injured. 5012 vehicles were bombed, and 929 were injured.

548 enemy military positions were destroyed, 299 bridges, 19 radio stations. 96 train and bus stations.

A total of 31,466 Japanese soldiers and officers died in air raids, and 5,581 horses.

### Striving for International Allies, Domestic Solidarity Must Not Be Relaxed

Let us review the domestic and international situation at that time, aside from military affairs:

Let's start with the international situation. Although at the beginning of the War of Resistance, the leader declared: We are fighting for national survival. Also fight for world peace and justice. Therefore, it is affirmed that our war of resistance must gain more help. However, in the first phase of the war, all we got was public opinion and moral support, and no political, military, or economic assistance. On the contrary, we also suffered insults and humiliations from quasi-fascist countries. However, in September of the 28th year, Europe broke out, and in the 29th year, the German, Japanese, and Italian alliance agreement was signed, and the line of world aggression and anti-

Free Talk　　Nine Years Ago Today　　Shao Fu　　Nine years ago today, I was in Tokyo, living in a Japanese home in Nakano. The landlord was named Ohori Ryunosuke. His wife was a minor clerk in the Ministry of Communications, and his daughter was studying at a women's normal school.　　As usual, I woke up at ten o'clock and started reading the newspaper. The large headlines in the Asahi Shimbun, along with the large photograph of the Lugou Bridge, prevented me from lying on the mat and reading it page by page as I usually did. I immediately got up and turned on the radio, eager to know our government's attitude—a public declaration—but I couldn't get it.　　I went out to find some friends to discuss the development of the situation. Finally, I even went to the Chinese Embassy in Azabu District. At that time, Mr. Xu Shiying had returned to China, and Mr. Yang Yunzhu was acting as Chargé d'Affaires. I didn't get to meet him. The sound of newsboys selling extras continued throughout the streets, and I felt really confused.　　At noon, I had lunch with a classmate named Jiang at a cafeteria near Shinjuku Station. It seemed like every Japanese person was looking at us with hostility. After lunch, we went to see Otaku (Soichi) and Chiba (Yu), who were our school's teachers, to hear their opinions. Their conclusion was: there won't be a war.　　It wasn't because of their words, or the opinions of a few friends, but I returned to my residence alone to calmly reflect on things. Based on my observations in Japan over the past year, Japan's goal is only "North China Economic Cooperation," using the same old methods. The question is, what is our government's determination?　　Therefore, on this day, I made a decision: if the government makes a statement, I will decide what to do; otherwise, I will continue with my original plan. So, I locked myself in my room and worked hard to finish the translation for my friend. I didn't leave Tokyo until August 11th.

Knocking Bamboo Poles　　Yang Mou　　　　"Knocking bamboo poles" is a very common expression in Shanghai dialect. Originally, it meant playful banter, lighthearted jokes. It's very common for friends to "knock bamboo poles" with each other in a harmless way: you treat me to snacks, I treat you to a movie.　　However, when this "knocking bamboo poles" is used by local bullies or people with special influence, the nature of it becomes serious. A little handle, a small mistake, plus their intimidation tactics, becomes an excellent source of extortion.　　Sometimes, the victim of this "knocking bamboo poles" willingly and happily hands over the money, or they may have some doubts in their heart, but they have no choice but to knowingly step into this trap.　　If your watch suddenly stops, or runs slow, you might open the back cover yourself. You see a wheel here, a wheel there, and you don't know where to start. Maybe you'll try to poke around with a needle, but you shake it, and it looks the same as before. There's nothing you can do but take it to a watch shop. The clerk at the watch shop puts on a magnifying glass and seems to examine it very carefully, listening to the sound, turning the knob a few times, and then looks up: "Twenty thousand yuan." Before you can even open your mouth, he continues, "The balance spring is broken, needs replacing. The hairspring is broken, needs oiling, cough cough, twenty thousand yuan, the most reasonable price." You don't understand (if you did, you wouldn't have come to his shop in the first place). There's nothing you can do except pay. What else can you say? He then seriously adds, "Come back in two weeks," to make it seem like he's carefully repairing it. In reality, as soon as you turn around, maybe he'll just tweak something somewhere, and the watch will be fixed.　　Do you need to get glasses? Yes, maybe you're nearsighted, maybe you're farsighted, maybe your eyes are perfectly healthy, but once you step into an eyewear company, aren't they extremely attentive in giving you an eye exam? Yes, and it's supposed to be a scientific eye exam. But if you trust this "science" too much, you'll suffer. The "science" this company uses to test your eyes will be different from the "science" used by another company. They exaggerate wildly, and in the end, they still want you to pay.　　Everyone knows how to perform tricks, but each has their own unique skill.　　Isn't this world all about hard extortion and fraud?　　Perhaps surgery has its ups and downs, therefore some "succeed and become kings," while others "fail and become bandits."

Beginning of Theater Reviews　　Xi Ju　　　　The practice of reviewing plays in newspapers is now prevalent in various countries, both in China and abroad. Seventy years ago in Shanghai, there were no films yet. At that time (early Guangxu period), the only entertainment for the people of Shanghai were Peking opera and Kun opera. The Dan Gui Tea Garden and Tian Xian Tea Garden performed Peking opera, while the San Ya Opera House performed Kun opera. Famous actors such as Sun Chunheng, Du Dieyun, Sun Juxian, and Dong Yueshan were all mainstays of the Dan Gui stage. San Mazi, Wang Haiquan, and Zuo Yuechun performed at the Tian Xian Tea Garden, and they were also outstanding performers of their time.　　When the Shen Bao was first published, it included brief reports on news from China and abroad, in addition to copying Beijing reports. By the early Guangxu period, it occasionally published poetry and essays. It was not until the sixth day of the fifth month of the Bingzi year of Guangxu, the second year (June 27, 1876), that it published its first theater review, titled "Famous Actors Performing." The article stated:　　"The Peking opera of Shanghai has already become famous throughout the country. Yesterday, I saw the play 'Welcoming Song's Coffin,' which tells the story of Wu Mu directly attacking the Jurchen capital and Wuzhu's surrender, written to uplift the spirit of China. The theme is novel, and the performance is excellent. The banners are bright, the soldiers and horses are majestic, and the mourning procession for the two emperors is imposing. The presence of Lama monks truly brings the scenery of the borderlands to life. Yue Wang's loyalty is unwavering, and he speaks with tears in his eyes. His words to the Fourth Prince are righteous and stern, embodying the spirit of a great nation. This was performed by Sun Chunheng, with vividness and color, inspiring a sense of loyalty and righteousness, even surpassing performances in Beijing. Du Dieyun was responsible for the arrangements, which shows his talent." The article was signed "Written by Le Laoren." Note: The Dan Gui Tea Garden later evolved into the Dan Gui First Stage. I remember twenty-five years ago, the Dan Gui First Stage was still the largest Peking opera venue in the central district of the concession. At that time, the New Stage was located in Nine Acre Field. As for the Gong Stage, Xiao Stage, Great Stage, and Golden Grand Theater, their history is shorter, and most old Shanghai residents can still talk about them in detail.

Childhood Again　　Translated from Time Magazine by Wen Yi　　After the American Civil War, an old woman was sent to a mental hospital by her children because their sixty-one-year-old mother was gradually becoming younger. After the director inquired about the old woman's past, he learned that the sixty-one-year-old woman had been very spoiled as a girl. Her parents' status and wealth made it easy for her to graduate from university, and then she married an excellent young man. Her husband had always treated her very gently and never required her to worry about anything. According to her, she didn't even know how to buy a train ticket because her husband always bought the tickets and took her to the train car. Their life was very happy, with one daughter and two sons, but unfortunately, her husband died at the age of thirty-nine. This made her very sad, and she also felt helpless because her husband's estate needed to be sorted out and distributed, and she had to manage three minor children. Although her property was not much, it seemed to her to be a very difficult task. In order to make her children understand that she could be their companion, after the mourning period ended, she dressed very beautifully, often stayed with her children, and made friends with some young women. When she went to parties with her children, she became younger in a matter of months, often wearing her daughter's clothes to the banquet. Since then, she became younger every few months. When her children discovered their mother's abnormal transformation, they sent her to the hospital. After she entered the hospital, the doctors tried to study the cause of her regression, but they could not stop her from regressing. Finally, she became like an eight or nine-year-old girl, calling for her mother in her spare time. When her children went to visit her in the hospital, it didn't seem like they were her children. On the contrary, she was like her children's little daughter. Because the doctors could not stop her regressive trend, she finally became a baby and could no longer walk. She liked people to hold her and often cried to pass the time, completely reverting to the nature of a baby. When her age was shortened to about four or five months, she left the hospital because in that year of recession, she lost all her property. So she was sent to a nursery. She continued to degenerate until she became a fetus. She didn't move, just breathed gently, and eventually returned to her creator.

The Immortals of Lujiawan　　Qing Jian　　Is there such a thing?!　　　　In a corner of Shanghai, there is a group of strange people, a half-monk, half-Taoist "immortal" paired with a self-proclaimed blind incense man, providing free medical treatment to the city's residents. Countless people are flocking to a desolate field where you can hardly see a person's shadow, hoping to get rid of physical suffering.　　The place is near the Lujiaqiao tram station. Just ask the ticket seller or the incense shop clerk when you get off the tram, and you will get very accurate directions. You won't have to walk more than a thousand steps to reach the residence of the immortal. It is said that this long-bearded immortal came from Maoshan and has attained enlightenment for many years. He no longer eats cooked food. Besides fruit, people have never seen him eat anything else. This highly accomplished immortal has an incense man who specializes in lighting incense and candles for people who come to seek medical treatment. He claims that he used to be blind, but was cured by the immortal, so he followed him to serve. Therefore, he is also infected with immortal energy and is now a half-immortal who does not eat cooked food.　　People who come to the immortal for treatment do not need to pay any fees. Of course, incense candles and gold ingots are indispensable. As for fruit, it is a voluntary offering and not a necessity, but most people bring it. Except for the first and fifteenth days of the lunar month and Sundays, the immortal sees patients every day, from about 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM.　　The immortal's method of treating illness is very different from that of a doctor. For minor illnesses, people only need to light incense, kowtow, and stand together. The immortal will hold a basin of tap water and sprinkle it on the crowd while chanting incantations. Each person will get a few drops, and with the boundless power of the immortal, the sick body will be cured immediately. Many pious men and women are constantly telling people that they have been cured of old ailments of several years or even decades by the immortal. As for serious illnesses, the immortal will take them into the bamboo fence and arbitrarily chant incantations, or wave his hands over the patient's body, pick up some fruit peels from the ground—mostly orange peels—and give them to the patient to eat, and the illness will immediately be alleviated. It is said that this immortal technique is unfailing and effective in all cases.　　Someone once calculated that among the more than 10,000 people who seek medical treatment every day, 1/10 are from the automobile class, 5/10 are from the rickshaw class, and the rest are common people. If divided by age, 1/2 are young men and women with American equipment and 1/2 are pious men and women of all ages. If this calculation is accurate, then in the two months since the immortal came to Shanghai, about 300,000 patients have been treated by the immortal. Comparing this number with the number of outpatients at the city's public hospitals in the past two months, I am afraid that it could shame medical doctors who have studied abroad!　　Now people are saying that it is the atomic age, but in this age, in Shanghai, the premier city of the Republic of China, there is such a strange drama, which is really an incredible thing! If this news spreads to friendly countries one day, what will they think? I think they will inevitably laugh their jaws off!

Taiwan Snails　　Nai Luo　　　　Taiwanese snails are as big as goose eggs, with yellowish-orange shells, often wriggling in dark corners. It is said that these snails did not exist in Taiwan before. The Japanese brought them from Europe, and now they have reproduced very prolifically.　　People here also eat snails. The method of cooking is to dry the snails by baking, remove the saliva from the shells, then crush the shells, dig out the snails, cut them into slices, add some sugar and soy sauce, and cook them in a pot. It is said that the taste is similar to beef, which can be considered an exotic flavor.

How to Escape from a Fire　　Chuan Qiu　　Telling You Some Common Sense　　　　Recently, there was a fire at the Da Mei Evening News. A gentleman jumped from the fourth floor because the stairs were burned. Fortunately, it was daytime, and people below helped by stretching out a canvas, allowing him to land safely. But at the same time, two women and children had no way to escape and were eventually buried in the fire. These kinds of things happen frequently in big cities. So firefighters often say, "If you can run out, it's a good house." Perhaps we can add another sentence: "A good homeowner is one who knows how to escape in a critical moment."　　These words are not trite clichés. Recently, in a city in the western United States, two children in their teens died in a fire in their home, both of them burned to death at the bedroom door. Originally, outside their bedroom on the second floor, there was a corridor, and below was a garden, so they could have jumped down safely. But in the sudden terror, just like many people act in the same circumstances, they started running towards the stairs, and as a result, they lost their lives.　　According to statistics, 3/4 of house fires that cause death are due to the fire starting downstairs, burning people to death upstairs. The reason is simple: heat rises. When a fire burns, the hot air and burning gas above often reach temperatures of 800 to 1000 degrees Celsius, and immediately fill the upper floors of the house. People wake up from their sleep and rush from the bedroom to the outside, often falling halfway. They die before the flames actually reach them.　　If some common sense can be instilled in the public and some training is provided, countless lives can be saved. If you wake up smelling smoke, never open the bedroom door. First, put your palm on the door frame above your head. If the wood is hot, never open the door, it's too late! Hot wood tells you that the room outside the door is already controlled by deadly heat, and you can no longer use the stairs.　　Therefore, you should keep the door tightly closed. If possible, jump out of the window, or at least shout for help loudly from the window. Since you have isolated the door from the fire, you have every chance of survival until the rescue workers arrive.　　If the wood is not very hot, you can carefully open it and take a look. At this time, you should use your legs to strenuously support the edge of the door, ready to close it immediately, and then open it gently by an inch or two. If hot air rushes towards you, you must close the door immediately and run to the window.　　In a burning house, the most critical actions are opening and closing doors, which are equally important. People find a fire in the house, and run around in panic, leaving the doors behind them open, so that the accumulated heat and smoke can flow freely upward, without any hindrance. If the door to the room where the fire started is immediately closed tightly after running out, then the flames, heat, and gas can be confined to that area for at least a few minutes, and the house may be preserved.　　There was a young housewife who was lighting a coal stove in the kitchen and added some kerosene, causing a vapor explosion and flames to fill the entire kitchen. She was flustered and panicked. When she regained her senses, her first thought was that her child was sleeping upstairs, so she hurried out of the kitchen, ran upstairs, picked up the child, and started running downstairs. At this time, the neighbors had already notified the fire department by telephone, and the fire truck immediately arrived to help. But when they walked into the house, they found that both the mother and child were dead in the upstairs room. Upon inspection, it was determined that they were killed by the smoke that rushed upstairs because she had not closed the door behind her.　　Firefighters all admit that many homeowners and children would not have lost their lives if they had known and practiced this simple common sense of opening and closing doors.

News Tidbits, Do the Officials' Wives Feel the Same?　　Feng Yi　　The major embezzlement case at the Two Roads Material Office has been investigated and interrogated by the Police Chief for many days, and the truth has been revealed. The main culprit is Yu Xiangyan, the wife of Zhang Hongtu, the director of the Material Office. This made me think of a speech given by the mayor's wife at a gathering, in which she said that a wife's thriftiness can reduce her husband's corruption in his duties. These words from the mayor's wife can be said to deeply understand the minds of general wealthy wives and are spoken with feeling. From this, I also think of some "civil servant" wives who usually act high and mighty, and though they keep complaining that their husbands' salaries as civil servants are too meager to maintain their livelihood, they are actually spending lavishly, making people suspect that they brought family property to subsidize their husbands. Now, we can at least get a part of the answer: these lavishly spending "civil servant" wives are not all bringing family property to subsidize their husbands. We sincerely hope that the mayor's wife's words can serve as a warning and a wake-up call to general wives! I believe that Mrs. Yu Xiangyan is just one occasional discovery in Shanghai's sea of desire!　　Recently, a group of speculators in two types of unified bonds lost their fortune in the adventurers' paradise, leading to the collapse of several securities firms and many people being imprisoned, ending up with ruined reputations. When they initially speculated in "unified bonds," they wanted to ride the wave and make a killing, but unexpectedly, the term "unified bonds" became a curse, and they eventually ended up "unified" with "debt" all over them!　　Recently, when I opened the newspaper, the news was full of cases of corruption, embezzlement, and large-scale fraud. When we look up and see the four big characters "Propriety, Righteousness, Integrity, and Shame" on the International Hotel, high above, it is a stark contrast. It seems that propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame are too far from the citizens, so the feeling for Shanghai citizens is only one of ridicule and sarcasm!

Comic Strip: Sanmao Joins the Army (57) by Zhang Leping

Social Services　　Answers to Readers　　Legal Queries　　　　Shen Shengwen, a long-time reader of Shen Bao, asked the editor: Your column is the mouthpiece of the people and the blessing of society. I humbly submit four points and pray for your reply.　　In the summer of the third year of the War of Resistance, a fake Bao chief forced the reader to move out of his house and use it as a fake Lianbao office. At that time, the reader was forced by the power of the enemy and had no choice but to obey. He has been enduring in silence for several years, and has complained, but after victory, he has encountered the same situation again. I humbly present my grievances and respectfully ask for your response. (1) Do the homeowners have the right to reclaim and use the houses occupied by enemy and puppet personnel during the War of Resistance after the victory? (2) Does the Shanghai Baojia Regulations have the same provision as Article 32 of the Jiangsu Province Baojia Regulations, which stipulates that the Baojia chief's office should be located in his own residence and should not be set up elsewhere? (3) If the Baojia chief still occupies the people's houses after the victory, is this against the law, and can the homeowners ask him to return it? (4) What is the appropriate and legal way to ask him to return it?　　[Lawyer Duanmu Kai replies] (1) (3) If it can be proven that the enemy and puppet personnel occupied the houses by force, you can ask them to return it. (2) You should inquire with the Baojia Office. (4) First, use a reminder procedure, and if it is ineffective, then seek a court ruling.　　(II) Ni Jue asks: Miss Yin, a friend of mine, was pursued by a foreign puppet official when she was studying in middle school. He used all kinds of tricks, including coercion and enticement. My friend was young and inexperienced and admired vanity, so she married him. After the marriage, she realized that her husband had a previous marriage. Limited by the circumstances, she did not dare to resist. She also has a little girl. Now, Miss Yin feels that her future is bleak and is suffering from the pain of being henpecked. Moreover, there is a large age gap between her and her husband. She intends to file a petition with the court for a divorce. Please answer: (1) Miss Yin is only nineteen years old and has not reached the legal age of adulthood. Does she have the qualifications to file a lawsuit? (2) Is her husband guilty of seducing a minor and bigamy? (3) Can she file a petition with the court (because she has no parents) for divorce and request alimony independently? (4) Who should have custody of the child?　　[Lawyer Duanmu Kai replies] (1) Since she is already married, she has the capacity to be a party. (2) Marrying again while having a spouse constitutes a crime under Article 237 of the Criminal Code. (3) If the above situation exists, you can sue for divorce and compensation for damages. (4) If there is an agreement, follow the agreement. If there is no agreement, follow the court ruling.　　Wang Houpei asks the editor: (1) At the outbreak of the War of Resistance, I immediately joined the army. My father had more than 30 mu of land, which was bought cheaply during the period of occupation. Can it be redeemed?　　　(2) Check the Southeast Daily (Hangzhou edition) February 8th issue carrying a section on the Executive Yuan's protection of the property rights of soldiers' families.　　(3) Enclosed is a current news dispatch from the Southeast Daily, February 8th, for reference:　　(Current News Dispatch) The Executive Yuan has decided at a routine meeting to protect the property rights of the families of soldiers who are serving in the military. All contracts for the sale or transfer of property of soldiers' families, whether in the occupied areas or in the rear, must be signed and sealed by the soldiers themselves in order to take effect. Otherwise, if the soldier returns, he can still petition the government to redeem the property at the price it was sold at the time. This has been communicated to all provinces and cities for compliance.　　[Lawyer Duanmu Kai replies] (1) If there was no coercion or fraud, you cannot claim that the sales contract is invalid. (2) The Southeast Daily is published in Hangzhou, and the returned manuscript does not indicate that the investigation has been completed.

Removing the Sludge, the Public Works Bureau Has Complied

"Handed Down by the Bureau"

Regarding the reader Zhu Chengwen's letter, which your newspaper forwarded, stating that the workers of this bureau piled the sludge at the entrance of a lane in Jiangsu Road when they were dredging the sewers in West Shanghai, and requesting prompt removal, we immediately sent workers to remove it, and it was completed on the 24th of this month. We hereby reply for your information. Sincerely, the Ditch and Sewer Engineering Office of the Shanghai Municipal Public Works Bureau.

### US Dollar and Hong Kong Dollar Remain Weak, Spot Market Gradually Stabilizes: Recovering and Rising 25,000 From Previous

The spot market calmed down slightly yesterday. After the opening, it gradually rose from 1.91 million. The Central Government allocated 29 units, and the price was reduced to 1.9225 million. At this time, it hovered around 1.92 million without any other changes. Around noon, the situation calmed down slightly, and the gold price also stabilized at around 1.93 million. In the afternoon, it was Saturday, and there was little change. The asking price was slightly firm. As a result, it recovered and rose 25,000 from the previous day. There was little change in gold ornaments. The unofficial rate was stable, and the interest rate stood at around 20%.

Foreign currency US dollars remained weak, far less than the spot market. In the early morning, it briefly rose to 2510 yuan, but was immediately surrounded by sellers. It briefly fell to 2470 yuan in the middle of the day, and struggled around 2490 yuan at noon. There was little change in the afternoon. Due to Saturday, there was even less activity. As a result, it fell slightly by 20 yuan from the previous day. The exchange rate for gold could be increased to 770 yuan per ten taels. The supply of Hong Kong dollars also exceeded demand, falling another 5 yuan, with the Hong Kong exchange rate at 540 yuan, the Indian exchange rate at 660 yuan, and the British exchange rate at 8600 yuan, all showing a surplus with a lack of support. The US exchange rate remained unchanged.

### No Financial Problems: Bank Association States

Yesterday's newspaper reported that a certain money shop had a large shortage of orders, and also claimed that another two or three financial institutions, such as so-and-so, "also had problems." According to a director of the Bank Association and a director of the Money Industry Association, after the exchange between banks and money shops, there were either surplus orders or shortage of orders. It is common for money shops to have shortages of orders. On Friday, a certain money shop did have a larger shortage, but it was far less than the figures published in a certain newspaper, and it had already been made up that night. As for the claim that so-and-so and other institutions had problems, the association had not heard of it. In short, the nature of deposits in banks and money shops now comes and goes, and is not as stable as before the war, which is indeed a fact. In reality, the money supply in the market is generally more relaxed on most days. Since the money supply was once extremely tight at the end of June, it has already eased by the beginning of this month. Recently, most of the industry has adopted a cautious attitude, and a financial crisis is unlikely to occur. The public should not rashly spread baseless rumors and frighten each other.

Further news, since the silver and money industry in this city reopened after the vacation at the end of June, the central bank tightened the money supply, causing several banks and money shops to have insufficient turnover. It is now known that these banks and money shops had taken measures on the previous day until 12:00 PM to balance the money supply, and all of them opened for business as usual yesterday morning. For example, Shanghai Pudong Bank, Dunyu Money Shop, and two trust companies have all temporarily resolved their difficulties. It is said that the industry has also provided a lot of support to avoid expanding the crisis. Yesterday afternoon, the person in charge of the Shanghai Clearing House stated that several banks and money shops that had not settled on the previous day had taken measures to make up for it that day, and there were no changes for those listed for exchange yesterday.

### Public Bonds Continue to Fall: A and B Reach 180 Yuan

Some people with large holdings of public bonds A and B sold them off, and some retail investors moved to C, D, and E for small-scale activities, causing the former to fall from 300 yuan to 180 yuan. On the contrary, type C rose from 400 yuan to 480 yuan before closing. Types D and E remained relatively stable. As a result, types A and B fell by another 90 yuan from the previous day, types C and D fell slightly by 20 yuan, and type E fell slightly by 40 yuan.

### Medium-Grained White Sugar Slightly Tight

Yesterday, the sugar market trend was slightly tight. The association's clearing price for spot grade 20 medium-grained white sugar was initially 100,800 yuan to 77,500 yuan, and then 8,000 yuan, an increase of more than 1,000 yuan. Road goods rose by 2,000 yuan to 94,000 yuan. Only the Shantou gang opened 780 packages of ordinary Huanggang Qing, priced at 85,600 yuan, and the rest did not trade.

### Wuyi Black Tea Transaction: Jardine Matheson and Wu Chang Purchase 1,200 Boxes

In the foreign company tea market, the British model chamber of commerce, and foreign companies are still inspecting the export patterns. The Wuyi black tea, which was discussed a few days ago, has already been agreed upon. Jardine Matheson and Wu Chang Tea Company jointly absorbed 1,200 boxes, priced at 56,000 yuan per picul. In addition, Wang Yutai, Xinye, Hua Tea, and other firms are still in negotiations. As for domestic sales tea, although the rainy season continues, the shops on this street and in nearby areas such as Suzhou and Wuxi have their own replenishment, but prices have not seen a surge.

### Asphalt Price Increase Has Been Stopped

Asphalt is in demand for soap making, so the price rose by more than 20,000 yuan last month, and all producing areas also hid their goods and soared in price. Therefore, there was a possibility of continued price increases. However, the recent tight money supply in the market has caused most soap factories to be cautious in purchasing goods, and transactions have not been lively. Although the market is not likely to ease, it is still lacking in excitement. It is said that the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau entrusted the customs to auction off a total of 1,560 piculs, which have been bid on. It is bound to be sold on the market. This batch of goods is extremely poor, and the selling price is naturally cheap. Therefore, it is unlikely that prices will continue to rise in the near future. The selling prices of various firms have not changed, as follows: Heben 86,000 yuan, Neiping oil 80,000 yuan, Duzhu oil 76,000 yuan, Diga oil 78,000 yuan, ordinary Lan oil 72,000 yuan, Macheng oil 70,000 yuan.

### Wool Fabric Transactions Gradually Increase

Yesterday, I inspected Qipan Street and Yishe Chang Le and other places. Wool fabric transactions are gradually picking up, but they are limited to dark colors for autumn and winter. Summer light-colored thin goods, except for those directly designated for retail, are also not actually accepted by the owner even if the wholesale price is 3,000 to 5,000 yuan cheaper per yard according to the market price. Generally, the business of street vendors and customers is more numerous than at the beginning of the week. The standard has not changed much. Fine wool goods seem to be more firm and active, because the purchasing agents of various gangs all want fine wool fabrics. The sellers, aware of the shortage of goods in the market, want to raise prices, but there are still two months before the actual sales, and both parties have to calculate interest. In addition, American goods continue to be imported, and British goods are shipped from Hong Kong to Shanghai and are already on the way, so buyers are unwilling to pay higher prices during the current weekly off-season.

### Male Silkworms Spin More Silk: New Invention by Scientists: Control the Reproduction of Female Silkworms

[Agence France-Presse, London, 5th] Professor Osdoonov recently made an invention that is of great importance to the silk industry and science in practice. This invention is a method of controlling the sex of silkworms. Because male silkworms spin more silk than female silkworms, a method is used to distinguish them, and at the same time control the reproduction of female silkworms, so that the number of male silkworms can be increased, and the silk spun is naturally larger.

### Recent Developments in Shanghai Shipping

[Reported by our newspaper] According to investigations by reporters, there are currently 90 shipping companies in Shanghai, of which more than 20 are open for business. The total tonnage of all ships is less than 200,000 tons. The state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has 300,000 tons. Most of the 90 companies that have not opened were sacrificed during the Anti-Japanese War and are now waiting for government compensation. Regarding shipping routes, there are currently ships from Minsheng, Dada, and Datong companies operating on the Yangtze River line, with an average of about one ship per day, which is still convenient. The difficulty is that there are too many returnees from Sichuan, and there is a tendency for supply to fall short of demand. On the Jiangbei line, northern Jiangsu has always been the supply base for Shanghai Minsheng, and pork, eggs, etc. are all transported from there. Passenger transport is not crowded due to the Communist Party. Currently, the only places with navigation are Nantong, Haimen, and Chongming. Dada and Datong companies all have ships operating on schedule, with an average of two ships per day. On the Ningbo-Wenzhou-Fujian line, there are currently Zhoushan, Chuanshan, Jiangya, and Ping An ships operating, and they can all sail on schedule. However, very few goods are shipped out. Only Fuzhou has wood shipped in. On the north and south ocean lines along the coast, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company currently has 39 seagoing vessels with a total of 140,000 tons operating, and private companies have 16 vessels with a total of 40,000 tons. Recently, due to military transport, it has been slightly crowded.

### Weakness Envelops the Securities Market: Even Popular Stocks Unable to Resist

Chinese stocks fell again, with large, popular stocks initially trying to resist, but soon collapsing. Small stocks were weak as soon as they entered the market, but after falling, many people saw cheap absorption, and instead reported a turnaround, reversing the situation of the previous day. Yongsheng Yarn fell from 435 yuan to 395 yuan, Mei Ya fell from 3,700 yuan to 3,300 yuan, Jingfu fell from 190 yuan to 175 yuan, Xinguang fell from 200 yuan to 185 yuan, and Qinxing fell from 160 yuan to 142 yuan. At noon, only large stocks were considered stable, while small stocks all rebounded slightly. As a result, Yongsheng Yarn and Mei Ya each fell by 10%, and Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing fell by about 5%. Cold medium-sized stocks were flat, while small and veteran stocks were all dragged down by about 5%. Transactions were not smooth.

Foreign stocks fell sharply again at the end of trading yesterday. Although large investors absorbed them from time to time, the money supply was still tight, and most of them were old long positions being sold off, and the buying sentiment was finally overwhelmed. Yisha fell from 7,400 yuan at the morning opening to 7,000 yuan, and Yinglian fell from 7,000 yuan to 6,600 yuan, and then stabilized slightly. Except for Yeguang, which was sluggish and the asking price was not affected, most of the others lost color. As a result, Yisha, Yinglian, Wheelock, and Asia each fell by about 10% from the previous day, while Yisha Beer, Paper Industry, and Steel Industry fell by 5%, and only Yeguang was flat.

### Cotton Yarn Market Sentiment Gradually Stabilizes: Spot Cotton Transactions Still Good

Yesterday, the yarn market turned stable. Regardless of large or small factories, there were inquiries. Although transactions were not numerous, the sentiment was stabilized because of this. 20-count yarn rose by about 5,000 to 15,000 yuan. 42-count yarn, because only cone yarn was available from Fangjian yesterday, and weaving factories needed to transfer shares, was uniquely good by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. 32-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn also followed and rose by 30,000 yuan. The Cantonese gang slightly eased their appetite.

Yesterday, New York American cotton reported a rise of 6 to 9 pounds per note, with the near-term price at US$31.06, the long-term price at US$31.30, and the spot price of Mitelin at US$31.73. Spot cotton transactions in this port were still good. Private yarn factories such as Shenxin, Dasheng, Jiafeng, and Qingfeng yarn factories all purchased, and market prices continued to be tight.

### Golden Hook Ear Recovers to Original Level

Tree Fungus and Dried Scallops Rare and Expensive

After a large batch of golden hook fungus arrived in Shanghai a few days ago, the price fell slightly, but because the cost of production was too high, the vendors were unwilling to sell it off lightly, and it was especially needed for the season, and sales from all directions were not weak. Now it has recovered to its original level. Since the Cantonese, Wenzhou, and Taiwanese gangs started to buy tree fungus, the stock in the market has become thinner, and there are fewer incoming goods, while domestic sales in this street are still smooth, so the price has continued to rise steadily. Dried scallops and tree fungus are scarce and expensive. Other goods are affected by the tight money supply and have turned from stable to sluggish.

### Tong Yi Trust Company's 25th Anniversary: Organizing Commemorative Deposits

Tong Yi Trust Company was established in July of the tenth year of the Republic of China and has now been in existence for twenty-five years. In order to commemorate the 25th anniversary of serving society, the company will not hold a ceremony, but will organize a special commemorative trust deposit. It is said that the interest is generous and there are also dividends. In addition, the commemorative reception expenses are saved and used for scientific scholarships to benefit students.

### Efforts to Alleviate Rice Shortage: Food Transported from All Directions: Directly Allocate to Rice Shops: This Measure Will Be Implemented Soon

Recently, rice and grain have been transported to Shanghai from all directions, and the authorities have gradually unblocked them. All shipments are strictly supervised by the authorities, and will soon be directly allocated to all legal rice shops at official prices, and sold at the market price in stores. This measure is only a matter of time. At that time, not only will rice shops have rice to sell, but they will also continue to be allocated, so the trend of food supply in this city will not be difficult to return to normal in the near future, and the general panic situation is expected to be resolved easily. Yesterday, 6,000 piculs of Jiangxi indica rice were allocated and sold in the north and south rice markets at a price of 42,000 yuan. Flour was weak in the morning and stable at noon. Retail customers and visiting gangs slightly purchased wheat, and the price of goods was raised slightly. Soybeans were flat. Shantou village shops inquired about soybean cake, and the market shape was stable. The oil market had a surge of incoming goods, and digestion was not smooth. The factory's wheat has not yet opened.

### The Ratio of Imports to Exports is Currently About Four to One

[Reported by our newspaper] It is reported that at present, the import and export trade materials of our country, in addition to a part that adopts barter trade methods, the number handled by the Central Trust Bureau on behalf of the government accounts for about one-third of the total amount. The rest is still controlled by merchants. According to recent statistics, the main export materials shipped to the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union are pigs, tung oil, and raw silk. The main exports to Japan are salt and wheat bran. Import materials include wood, newspapers, flour, rice, rayon, railway equipment, hardware, pigments, silkworm eggs, mulberry seeds, etc. The ratio of import materials to export materials is four to one. If the traffic situation is favorable, there is still a tendency for import materials to increase. The government has high hopes for export materials, but due to domestic labor costs and exchange rates, it is not optimistic that export materials will increase in the short term.
