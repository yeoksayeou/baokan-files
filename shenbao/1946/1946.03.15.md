At this point, the reporting and review of items were completed, and the session entered the discussion phase. After the recess, the chairman announced the start of proposal discussions. The presidium first reported on (1) research opinions regarding the election methods for the Central Standing Committee and (2) the review report of the Food Problem Report Review Committee.

He also reported on the issuance of Northeast circulating currency, lasting for one hour and twenty minutes.

### Liu Fei and Zhang Jia'ao Report

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] Today marks the fourteenth day of the Second Plenary Session. The 16th meeting in the morning focused on reports regarding the Northeast issue. The meeting commenced at 9:20 AM with 258 committee members present, including Yu Youren, Song Ziwen, Wu Zhongxin, and Gu Weijun. Committee member Bai Chongxi chaired the meeting. Following the reading of the 15th session's minutes and report documents, the chairman announced the Northeast problem report. Firstly, Liu Fei, Vice Minister of the Military Affairs Department, reported on the military situation in the Northeast. Liu described (1) the military situation in the Northeast from the Soviet Union's declaration of war on Japan on August 9th to Japan's surrender on August 14th; (2) our side's agreement with the Soviet side on the date and procedure for the Soviet troops' withdrawal, based on the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship; (3) the advance of our troops sent to the Northeast for the takeover; (4) the actual situation of our troops' defense takeover; (5) after Japan's surrender, the Chinese Communist troops began to enter the Northeast, increasing their strength and expanding their territory under the guise of "opposing civil war," and the reality of this situation; (6) the current situation of the Chinese Communist troops' disruptive activities in various parts of the Northeast. During Liu's report, he was clearly reserved due to various difficulties, and the assembly frequently responded with encouraging applause. Subsequently, Zhang Jia'ao reported on the lack of results in negotiations with the Soviet side in Changchun regarding the takeover of industries and mines, and the reasons for this. He stated that, based on his observations over the past few months, he believes that the future of the Northeast requires starting with improving politics, developing light industry, and popularizing education. After a recess, the review of the Northeast problem began, with speeches by Committee Members Zhu Qing and Mei Gongren. Finally, Committee Member Chen Cheng reported on the meeting between Committee Member Chen Lifu and representatives of seven Northeast groups, relaying the opinions of the representatives. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM.

[United Press, Chongqing, 14th] Zhang Jia'ao reported at the Second Plenary Session today that the National Government notified the United States and Britain in September of last year that Japanese industrial property in the Northeast should belong entirely to China. In November, when he arrived in the Northeast, a Soviet representative told him that the Soviet Union's losses in the war were at least as significant as the combined losses of the Allied nations, so the Soviet Union should receive war spoils in the Northeast. He immediately returned to Chongqing to report to Chairman Chiang, and then returned to Changchun with Chiang Ching-kuo to consult with Soviet representatives, explaining that the war spoils issue should be resolved by the Sino-American-British-Soviet Japanese Control Committee. The Soviet side should facilitate the entry of Chinese troops into Shenyang and other places so that the National Army can first secure public order while awaiting the arrival of the main forces. Shortly after, he returned to Chongqing again, and on December 24th, he received instructions from Chairman Chiang: (1) It should not be acknowledged that the Soviet side regards Japanese industries as war spoils; (2) Sino-Soviet economic cooperation should not be discussed before the withdrawal of Soviet troops. On January 5th, he formally met with Marshal Malinovsky in Changchun. Malinovsky's demands were greatly reduced compared to before, requesting joint Sino-Soviet management of 9 out of 22 mineral deposits in the Northeast, 9 out of 54 power plants, and 6 out of 8 machinery factories, but no economic cooperation agreement has been established with the Soviet side to date. After Japan's surrender, Northeast industry suffered significant damage, with an estimated 16% of coal mines, 50% of steel factories, 70% of machine factories, and 50% of textile factories destroyed. Food losses also amounted to 25%, while power plants suffered only 0.7% damage. The government had hoped that Soviet troops would secure the public order of cities such as Shenyang while awaiting the arrival of National Army troops for the takeover.

### Chairman Chiang Uses Gu Weijun as a Reference; Approves Increasing Police Pay

[United Press, Chongqing, 14th] Chairman Chiang received Gu Weijun, the ambassador to the UK, last night, inquiring about the progress of the United Nations. Gu recently returned to the capital to report to the government and participate in the Second Plenary Session. Furthermore, the chairman has approved a five-year plan to reform the police, increasing police pay, improving equipment, and enhancing training.

### It is Reported that Fu Zuoyi's Participation Received a Warm Welcome

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] Committee member Fu Zuoyi attended the Second Plenary Session for the first time on the 14th. When Fu entered the hall, committee members rushed to shake his hand, expressing fervent congratulations to this long-victorious general who defended the country and its territory. When Committee Member Lu Zhonglin reported on his inspection of North China, he paid particular respect to Fu, earning enthusiastic applause from the assembly. A reporter specifically approached Fu, who said that the people of Baotou and Guihua after the lifting of the siege were extremely impoverished, and the provincial government had organized emergency relief, but the efforts were only a drop in the bucket, and relief work still urgently needed to be promoted. Currently, four of the twenty-one counties in Suiyuan are occupied by Communist troops.

### Passengers Treated as Cargo; China National Aviation Corporation Violates Regulations; Yu Feipeng Claims to Have Ordered Correction

[This newspaper, Chongqing, 14th] The China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) charges passengers as cargo in violation of regulations, at a rate of over 9,000 yuan per kilogram. If each person weighs 50 kilograms, then a fee of over 400,000 yuan is required. The charter flight method is also more expensive than passenger fares. During the Second Plenary Session, Pan Gongzhan questioned Minister Yu Feipeng of the Ministry of Communications about this matter. Minister Yu replied that after receiving the report, the Ministry had ordered the person in charge of the company to earnestly correct the situation. The carrying of passengers on cargo planes should be calculated according to passenger rates and should not be charged as cargo. The company's transportation of passengers from Kunming to Shanghai and Guangdong is approved by the air inspection office, and tickets are sold in accordance with regulations.

### Various Northeast Groups in Chongqing Petition the Second Plenary Session, Presenting Seven Demands

[This newspaper, Chongqing, 14th] The Chongqing Northeast Native Place Association, the Northeast Three Provinces Reconstruction Promotion Association, the Northeast Construction Society, the Northeast Refugee Relief Committee, and the Northeast Righteous People Returning Home Relief Committee, among other groups, believe that the Northeast problem is becoming increasingly serious, and our government's true effectiveness in the takeover remains a mystery, causing extreme anxiety. They originally planned to petition the Second Plenary Session yesterday, but the meeting was adjourned. Therefore, they changed the plan to depart from the Heilongjiang Reconstruction Promotion Association at 9 AM this morning to petition the Second Plenary Session, specifically presenting seven requests, requesting the plenary session to formulate them into proposals and submit them to the government for implementation: (1) Request the government to notify the Soviet Union to fulfill the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and withdraw its troops immediately; otherwise, it should formally declare that the Soviet Union has violated the alliance treaty. (2) The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship is the maximum extent of China's concessions. In addition to the treaty, please request the government to reject all Soviet demands that harm rights and interests. (3) Request the government to disclose Sino-Soviet diplomatic negotiations and stop on-the-spot negotiations. (4) Request the government to take strong measures and send more troops to take over the Northeast by force. (5) The illegal regime and armed troops established by the Chinese Communists in the Northeast in collusion with foreign forces and taking advantage of the opportunity of the unrecovered national sovereignty should be thoroughly eliminated and cannot be resolved through party negotiations to avoid future troubles. (6) Request the government to implement the ceasefire order thoroughly; military mediation is not applicable to the Northeast. (7) List Xiong Shihui's dereliction of duty and request the government to remove him from office and punish him severely to uphold the law and reassure the people of the Northeast.

### West Bank of the Liao River

— Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent in the Northeast, Han Qingtao

The weather in March should be full of spring in the Jiangnan region. However, here it is desolate. A heavy snow a few days ago has covered the wilderness with a new silver coat.

In the sharp cold wind, the reporter stepped onto the "Gouying Road," a branch line of the Beining Railway from Goubangzi to Yingkou. Sadly, this railway is currently only partially open to traffic. The only destinations are the "Hujia" and "Panshan" stations. In the past, this branch line dealt a heavy blow to the Japanese South Manchuria Railway and played a role in maintaining the Northeast's transportation economy.

Leaving Goubangzi, the first thing that comes into view is the airfield. More than a dozen Japanese planes are parked on the field. The machinery inside the planes has been dismantled, leaving only the wreckage to be weathered.

The earth is boundless. Except for the short roots of rice seedlings left over from the autumn harvest and rows of earthen mounds, there is nothing else in the fields. Farming will have to wait for a while. Every year, the fertile, oily black soil yields abundant harvests.

Several small rivers cross the railway. The bridges have been damaged and, after repairs, can only barely support traffic. The train crawls slowly on the bridges, making people a little nervous. The houses at the bridgeheads and the equipment along the line also show signs of damage.

Who are the destroyers? Sadly, it is not an external force on this route, but our own Communist troops. Ordinary locals are saying: "The motherland fought hard for eight years, and the Northeast was lost for fourteen years. Even if we speed up construction, we still can't catch up with others. If this continues, we will never be able to turn over a new leaf!"

In the heavy snow, the train entered the first station, "Hujia." Hujia is a small station. The stationmaster's office is located in a small courtyard next to the station. South of the railway is a long village, "Hujia Fort," with six to seven hundred households, almost entirely farmers. Daily necessities must be purchased in Goubangzi. There is also a large row of houses north of the railway. Because there are stationed troops, small vendors selling melon seeds, peanuts, white pears, and cigarettes have been added.

A train is parked at the station. A young general is leading a group of military personnel, handling transportation maintenance and local security affairs. They have organized a militia and have also established six national schools in the surrounding areas, which has greatly helped the county government, which has extremely limited funds, in promoting education.

Moving forward in the wind and snow, armed brothers with guns are stationed at important intersections and river locations along the line. The situation seems a bit tense. It is said that the village chiefs and people in these villages are afraid of those plainclothes squads. They are often harassed, and in serious cases, they lose their lives because being close to the National Army is labeled as "traitorous."

We have arrived at "Panshan." Panshan is a larger station. The county seat is on the right side of the railway. There is no brick city, but rather a not-so-obvious earthen enclosure. Panshan did not have much production in the past. The land was barren, and the people were impoverished. The county was established late, so it does not have any famous attractions.

Recent years have been different. It has become a county with an astonishing rice yield. For the sake of war and the people's livelihoods, the Japanese developed Panshan's barren alkaline land, turning it into fertile fields, which was a great success. This place is called "Dawa," forty li north of the county seat.

The reason Panshan has so much alkaline land is due to the influence of the nearby coast. A "alkaline river" flows beside the county seat. The Japanese first had the puppet Manchukuo government use funds to buy 82,500 "tian" of land in the Dawa area (in the Northeast, it is customary to call ten mu of land a "tian"), and then moved a large number of Japanese and Korean farmers to cultivate the land. They used machinery to draw water from the Liao River, washing away the alkalinity and nourishing the fields. The trial planting of rice was successful.

Because it has not been open for long and is limited by manpower and funding, only 27,000 tian have been cultivated. Last year's rice harvest totaled 32,000 tons. This rice-producing area can be used as a state-run farm in our country.

Currently, there are more than 6,000 Japanese farmers and 9,000 Koreans there. In terms of technology, it is still necessary to use them, so they cannot all be repatriated.

The rice from Dawa is of excellent quality, but the grain reserves from last year have been gradually taken away recently. Now is the time to plan this year's farming. But it is in the hands of the Communist troops. The only hope is that the already cultivated land should not be allowed to become alkaline and barren again.

The entire county has two streets and sixteen villages. Currently, the county government controls only one county seat—the county seat is one street in the puppet Manchukuo street system—and seven villages in the west. The remaining Tianzhuangtai street and nine villages are in the hands of the Communist troops.

According to the county government's statistics, the county has a population of 310,000, with about 10,000 people in the county seat. There are 26 schools in the county, including one elementary school and one advanced elementary school in the county seat, as well as an agricultural elementary school. There are plans to convert it into a provincial junior high school, but due to all the turmoil, the work is yet to be carried out.

Business is slow in the shops in the town, and there are few goods in stock. Only a few restaurants and some small vendors selling cigarettes and snacks are doing business with the soldiers.

There is a large reed pond west of the county, about 120 li long from north to south and more than 30 li wide from east to west, supplying raw materials for the Jinzhou Paper Mill and another part for making reed mats. The Japanese once established a small reed mat factory.

A highway leading to Tianzhuangtai and Yingkou runs almost parallel to the "Gouying" railway and passes through the county. Facing the railway bridge is the Dabeng Bridge with 24 or 25 spans, with stone bases built in the flowing river water, which was a large-scale project. It is said that the Communist troops originally planned to burn it down when they retreated, but fortunately, it was left behind due to time constraints.

The county seat is surrounded by fortifications. The National and Communist troops are confronting each other within 20 li to the east, and the guard is quite strict. The "Shaling" that the Communist troops attacked from February 16th to 20th is a small town of more than 700 households, 60 li east of Panshan County.

Panshan County Chief Jin Boqi said: "I came to the county seat on December 14th last year to start the takeover. The Japanese and puppet regimes handled all the handover procedures very clearly, so the takeover work went smoothly. In general, the county government staff who stayed on regarded it as an honor to be Chinese again. In the two and a half months, although they only borrowed a small amount of salary, they were still happy to work. Unfortunately, on January 13th, the county seat was once captured by the Communist troops, resulting in heavy losses. On February 10th, the county was finally recovered by the National Army, and the county administration was reorganized. However, everything the county government had was swept away, and everything is very difficult!"

The snow is getting heavier and heavier. When the reporter left the county seat to the west, the snow had already reached a foot deep.

(Goubangzi, March 5th)

### Internal Strife in the Northeast Can Be Avoided; Chairman Chiang Warned the Communist Party Not to Bring Misery to the People

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] Chongqing News: Military intelligence indicates that the Communist troops' military probing and political testing in the Northeast failed in the final minutes of the Soviet troop withdrawal, but the opportunity to establish a foothold and sow seeds was obtained effortlessly. It is said that the three-member delegation of the Military Mediation Department is about to fly to the Northeast for inspection. The Communist troops seem to welcome this move extremely, because in this way, they can reap the fruits of victory empty-handed at an extremely low price and can also conceal the signs of their ineffective propaganda in the Northeast military severance. Based on this, it can be observed that using the method of military mediation to clarify the situation in the Northeast and first eliminate internal strife may not be the misfortune of the people of the Northeast. Also, this morning's news is that Chairman Chiang indirectly warned the Communist Party, "Do not use a little power of military force to bring misery to the people, attempt to win internal strife, and violate Dr. Sun Yat-sen's expectations. Today, the two major parties should look far ahead, focus on the big picture, and not be preoccupied with partisan interests, to serve as an example for other political parties." This is truly a golden statement, enough to strike a blow to the ambitious individuals who are taking advantage of the situation in the Northeast, and internal strife in the Northeast may be avoided. The Soviet troop withdrawal from Changchun and Harbin seems to be pending. Military diplomacy will be deployed separately.

### Xiong and Zhang Return to the Northeast Soon; Military Diplomacy Will Be Deployed Separately

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] Chongqing News: Political intelligence indicates that Xiong Shihui and Zhang Jia'ao are scheduled to fly back to the Northeast in the short term. Xiong may cancel his resignation. However, for the convenience of cleaning up the Northeast, there will be separate deployments for this local military command and diplomatic negotiations, which will be revealed in the coming days.

### Harbin Assassination Case

[Our Newspaper, Harbin, 12th] Li Zhaolin, the Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Army, and Chairman of the Harbin Sino-Soviet Friendship Association (original name Zhang Shouqian), was stabbed to death on Shuidao Street on the 9th. The Harbin Municipal Government is now dispatching police officers to strictly apprehend the murderer. It is learned that on that day, Mr. Li was traveling from his home to the association office when his car broke down midway. He switched to a rickshaw. Upon arrival, before removing his hat and coat, he went out, telling his secretary that he was going to No. 9 Shuidao Street to meet a friend for a brief discussion and would return shortly. He did not return by evening. Association staff went to the address twice but found no one there. The next day, Mayor Yang reported this matter and instructed the police bureau to send officers to search No. 9 Shuidao Street. Mr. Li's body was discovered in a locked empty room above the second gate. After receiving the report, Mayor Yang and the Chairman of the Songjiang Customs immediately notified the Soviet side. Following examination by Chinese and Soviet inspectors and forensic doctors, it was determined that the cause of death was knife wounds. The body was transferred to a Soviet military hospital for autopsy.

### The CCP Has Established "Provincial Governments" in Jilin and Longjiang

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 13th] During the suspension of the Northeast takeover work, the CCP took the opportunity to actively expand its military power and create a regime. Jilin Province has already established a provincial government through a so-called People's Representative Congress, with Zhou Baozhong as Chairman. Now, Heilongjiang has also established a "provincial government" and convened a so-called People's Representative Congress. It is claimed that this provincial government was established by the People's Self-Defense Army in November of last year. According to Han Junjie, the Chairman of Heilongjiang Province, who left Changchun on January 23rd to go north for the takeover, he is still stranded in Harbin.

[Central News Agency, Harbin, 13th] According to a contact person from Bei'an to the provincial government, there are over 20,000 Communist troops within Heilongjiang, stationed in various counties within the province. Under the slogan of building a new democratic government, they forcibly conscript civilians to form the People's Autonomous Army, also known as the Militia, to replenish their forces. Any resistance is met with the death penalty. According to the Harbin Communist Party's newspaper, the province established a provincial government in Bei'an on November 1st of last winter, with Chen Dafan as Chairman and Yang Yingjie as Vice-Chairman. Furthermore, Yu Tianfang, Zhang Guangdi, Wang Jun, Chen Lei, and others formed the People's Autonomous Army. Of the nine provinces in the Northeast, Heilongjiang has suffered the most devastation at the hands of the populace. On February 1st, the puppet provincial Chairman Chen Dafan convened the so-called first People's Representative Congress. Several days ago, Vice-Chairman Yang Yingjie led eight puppet county magistrates and six guards to Harbin and stayed at the train station to meet with the Soviet military authorities.

### Ministry of Education Rewards American Troops - Distributes Prizes to Ten People

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] Vice Minister Hang of the Ministry of Education stated that in order to reward the hard work of the American troops who fought in China during the Anti-Japanese War, the Ministry of Education is awarding prizes to ten former American officers and soldiers who served in China. Regardless of whether they are currently in China, these American officers and soldiers can apply to the Sino-American Cultural and Material Supply Committee for approval, after which each person will receive a prize of US$1,500 per year, for a total of three years.

### Switzerland Formally Announces - Abandonment of Special Privileges in China

[French News Agency, Swiss Capital, 13th] According to an official announcement, Switzerland and China have signed an agreement here stipulating that Switzerland will abandon its consular jurisdiction in China. However, the existing most-favored-nation treatment will remain valid until a new treaty is concluded between the two countries.

### Soviet Troops Withdraw from Siping Street - Communist Troops Take the Opportunity to Attack the Suburbs Twice - Telephone Lines Between Shenyang and Changchun Malfunction

[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 13th] Shenyang, 13th Telegram: The National Army in Tiexi, having been stationed since January 5th, after a month and twenty-five days, formally entered the Shenyang city at 6:00 PM on the 13th. As they passed through the city in vehicles, the citizens cheered and rejoiced. It is now that day that the city defense order has been received.

[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 13th] Shenyang, 13th Telegram: The entire city here today is beaming with joy, exchanging knowing smiles, as if a heavy burden accumulated over many years has been suddenly lifted, making everyone feel incredibly light. The National Army set out from Tiexi district yesterday and entered the city in the evening. As their passage through the urban area was limited and they remained stationed outside the city, only a few citizens were aware of their presence. However, this morning, the Commander of the 52nd Army, Zhao Gongwu, led his troops into the city. The Sino-Soviet Daily, which was recently published here, even printed an extra edition, causing the entire city to rejoice. Citizens crowded the streets. This "Chicago of the East," with its two million citizens, seemed to be revived from near death, eagerly spreading the news of the National Army's entry into the city. The joy was beyond measure, and upon witnessing the majesty of the National Army, some people could not help but shed tears of joy, saying, "You've finally arrived!" A military-political soiree will be held tonight at the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, so that these long-suppressed feelings can be fully expressed and shared at the party, to commemorate this historical night. The Soviet Commander, Gafutang, was originally scheduled to leave Shenyang today, but he notified last night that the problem of his transportation has been resolved, and so he withdrew from here last night, leading to the cancellation of the farewell soiree scheduled for today. Commander Zhao Gongwu told reporters that there are no issues with Shenyang's security. Currently, in addition to the National Army being stationed in various factories and workplaces, the remaining areas are patrolled by the police. Furthermore, the entire Beining Railway is now open and unobstructed. Although some places suffered minor damage in the past, they have now been completely repaired.

[Central News Agency, Siping Street, 14th Urgent Telegram] The Soviet troops here have now been redeployed. Before their departure, they notified the Liaobei Provincial Government that they are no longer responsible for maintaining security. The Soviet troops withdrew from the outposts on the outskirts of the city on the 9th, and that night, Communist troops launched an attack. They launched another attack on the 11th. Now that the Soviet troops have completely withdrawn, they are advancing step by step. The suburbs have been extremely unstable in recent days. The provincial capital's security team and the police are doing their best to maintain order. Provincial Chairman Liu Handong is determined to defend to the death. Furthermore, the County Magistrate of Changtu County has been captured by the Communist troops, and the Lishu County government is heavily besieged. The situation is extremely urgent.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 14th] Transportation circles report that long-distance telephone lines between Changchun and Shenyang have now malfunctioned.

[United Press, Chongqing, 14th] Authoritative sources here believe that, apart from a small number of troops remaining in Dalian and Lushun, the Soviet troops intend to withdraw from the southeastern region of the nine northeastern provinces and leave the majority of their troops stationed in the northwestern region along the Vladivostok-Harbin line. It is claimed that this plan will make the Soviet border a straight line, stretching from Vladivostok across the Northeast to Mongolia, thereby eliminating what the Soviet Union has always considered a threat to its coastal province.

### Soviet Troops in Greater Britain - Advance Towards the Turkish Border on Three Routes - Wealthy Iranians Flee to Seek Refuge

[Our Correspondent] San Francisco, 14th Broadcast: The U.S. State Department has recently issued a statement saying it has received highly reliable information that Soviet troops stationed in Iran are continuing to move.

[Our News] London, 14th Broadcast: The number of Soviet troops, which had doubled to 60,000 in the past 30 days, some of them have already left Greater Britain, and are rapidly advancing in three directions towards the Turkish border. Wealthy Iranians are fleeing Tehran to seek refuge. Some of the Soviet troops withdrawing from Greater Britain are heading north towards Maragheh, while others are advancing directly towards Kio City on the Turkish border. At the same time, some Soviet troops are also moving towards Maragheh and Miandoab, creating a tense situation.

[Associated Press, Tehran, 14th] A detachment of Soviet troops departing from Tabriz, Iranian Azerbaijan, is reported to have turned west towards the Turkish border.

[French News Agency, Turkish Capital, 14th] As Soviet troops move to reinforce western Iran, Soviet newspapers and radio stations are repeatedly conducting anti-Turkish propaganda campaigns, which has increased unease among the people here. Although it is generally believed that these troops will not exert pressure on Turkey in the short term, the appearance of Soviet armored units and cavalry units not far from the Turkish border can be seen as a prelude to the arrival of a threat. As a result of the Soviet Union's recent actions, Iraq has realized that its position is almost identical to that of Turkey.

[Associated Press, Washington, 13th] Iranian Ambassador to the United States, Al-Haji, declared today that the Soviet troops moving south towards Tehran may be aimed at Iraq, Turkey, or Iran itself. This Soviet move is completely unexpected. However, the situation in Iran is no longer a war of nerves. It is expected that the Soviet Union will soon make demands on Turkey, which may include the provinces of Kars and Ardahan, and a Soviet base in the Dardanelles Strait.

[United Press, Washington, 14th] It was learned today from reliable sources that the Turkish Embassy in the United States has not received any information from Ankara regarding the concentration of Soviet troops in the Iranian Azerbaijan province. The Turkish Ambassador will be going to New York today to attend the Mayor's banquet for Churchill. The Ambassador hopes to meet with Churchill, as he is very familiar with the situation in Turkey.

[French News Agency, London, 13th] The "Standard Evening News" published on its front page a dispatch from its New York correspondent with the headline "Soviet Troops 30 Kilometers from Tehran" and "Soviet Troops Reinforce, Crossing the Border into Three Cities." It stated that according to Iranian sources, Soviet troops are currently less than 30 kilometers from Tehran. Soviet cavalry units have entered Iran from the coast of the Caspian Sea and have occupied three cities. Armored units and tanks are moving south from northern Iran. Cavalry patrols have entered Mianeh, 150 kilometers southeast of Greater Britain and less than 400 kilometers from Tehran. The three cities of Maragheh, and Miandoab are located south of Greater Britain, with the latter being 110 kilometers from the intersection of the Turkish, Iranian, and Iraqi borders.

### Bevin Condemns Soviet Violation of Agreement in the House of Commons - Declares British Troops Have No Intention of Re-entering Iran

[Our News] London, 14th Broadcast: British Foreign Secretary Bevin declared in the House of Commons today that if Soviet troops withdraw from Iran, Britain will agree to the Security Council's decision and allow direct negotiations between the Soviet Union and Iran.

Bevin condemned the Soviet Union for violating the agreement by not withdrawing its Soviet troops stationed in Iran by March 2nd. Bevin stated that British troops withdrew from Iran on March 2nd as agreed and have no intention of returning to the country. Bevin also said that Stalin had guaranteed Iran's independence, and the Soviet Union's current actions are puzzling.

Another report: Two months ago, there were only 30,000 Soviet troops stationed in Azerbaijan, but the number has now doubled.

[Associated Press, London, 13th] The British representative in Tehran has sent a telegram confirming the U.S. State Department's statement regarding the movement of Soviet troops. Sources familiar with the matter said that Bevin had been in communication with U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes in the past 24 hours, with the situation in Iran being the most notable topic. 10 Downing Street, the Prime Minister's residence, denied that Prime Minister Attlee had spoken with U.S. President Truman by telephone.

[Associated Press, Washington, 13th] Secretary of State Byrnes reported to President Truman today on the urgent developments in the international situation, with the main focus being the Soviet Union's troop increase in Iran. According to telegrams received here, Soviet troops in Karaj are equipped with Sherman tanks, which has drawn attention from government officials. These tanks were delivered to the Soviet Union under the Lend-Lease program for use in the war against Germany. Under the current circumstances, if the Soviet Union uses Lend-Lease military equipment in Iran, the United States may file a new protest with the Soviet Union.

### Iranian "Reactionary Forces" - Plotting to Seize Soviet Territory?

A Soviet Writer's Witty Remarks

[Associated Press, London, 14th] Moscow Radio broadcast a paper by Soviet writer Alekseyev today, stating that Iranian "reactionary forces" hope that war will break out between the Soviet Union and other powerful countries, so that they can take the opportunity to seize Soviet territory. The Soviet government, in view of the situation on its southern border, must pay close attention to the activities of the Iranian government and the diplomatic policies it adopts.

### Stalin Comments on Churchill's Speech - Hindering UN Cooperation - Accuses Churchill of Inciting War Against the Soviet Union - Churchill Refuses to Comment on Stalin's Remarks

[TASS, Moscow, 13th] A reporter from "Pravda" asked Stalin to comment on Churchill's recent speech. Stalin replied, "I believe that Churchill's purpose is to sow discord among the United Nations and hinder cooperation between them. In terms of peace and security, Churchill has taken the position of a war agitator."

[Associated Press, London, 13th] Moscow Radio broadcasted today a talk between Marshal Stalin and a reporter from "Pravda." According to Stalin, several points made by Churchill in his speech in Fulton, Missouri, regarding Poland, Yugoslavia, Romania, and Hungary were lies. He added, "Churchill's speech

was very dangerous. Churchill advocated war against the Soviet Union, while at the same time proposing a 50-year treaty of friendship with the Soviet Union. Such a treaty is bound to be a mere formality, with no value. The Soviet Union sacrificed 7 million people in this war, exceeding the combined losses of Britain and the United States. Churchill said that the current government of Poland is under Soviet influence, and that the Soviet Union is demanding too much from Germany. This is not true. Poland has chosen a new path and is unwilling to follow the direction indicated by Churchill, which has disappointed him. Churchill wants Yugoslavia to be ruled by Mihailović and the royal family, but it should be known that the power of the Communist Party today is the result of their struggle for national freedom. Churchill mentioned the common people in his speech. He was rejected and dismissed from his position by the common people in Britain. Now, such actions are happening throughout Europe, which of course is not something Churchill likes. Churchill once wanted to organize a 'crusade' against the Soviet Union. Whether this move will succeed is doubtful. However, Churchill's speech is a dangerous action, aiming to sow seeds of division among countries and hinder continued cooperation. Churchill is currently participating in something that not only has people echoing his sentiments in Britain, but also in the United States. However, it must be pointed out that Churchill and his friends remind people of Hitler and his friends. Hitler adopted racial theories to establish his war doctrine, declaring that only those who speak Germanic languages are pure races. Churchill also advocates war using racial theories, granting privileges to English-speaking nations and giving them the power to decide the fate of the world. The Germanic race theory made Hitler's faction believe that they were the only nation entitled to rule other countries. Now, Churchill's faction also claims that English-speaking countries should be the supreme rulers of the world. Churchill and his friends in Britain and the United States are now issuing an ultimatum to non-English-speaking countries, saying, "If you automatically recognize our superiority, everything will be fine. Otherwise, war is inevitable." People of all countries

shed blood for five years in order to fight for national freedom and independence, not merely to replace Hitler's rule with Churchill's rule. Today, non-English-speaking countries represent the majority of the world's population. It is easy to understand why they do not want to become new slaves. But Churchill cannot understand this simple and clear truth, which is Churchill's tragedy. Examining Churchill's purpose, it is clear that he is launching a war against the Soviet Union. However, while advocating war against the Soviet Union, he also proposed extending the Anglo-Soviet friendship treaty to 50 years. His intention is nothing more than to regard the treaty as a mere formality, only to use it as a cover to conceal his anti-Soviet activities."

[Reuters, New York, 14th] Churchill declined to comment on Stalin's remarks to a "Pravda" reporter.

### What are Soviet Tank Experts Doing in Iran?

### Editorial: The Emergency of the Middle East Situation

At a time when the situation in the Northeast remains heavily clouded, news from the Middle East is making us feel the urgency of the situation there. From Turkey to Iran, the severity of the situation is increasing daily. According to an Associated Press report from Tehran on the 13th, the most reliable sources say that Soviet troops are moving along northern Iran towards the southwestern Turkish and Iraqi borders, and Soviet troops and armored vehicles have entered Karaj, 20 miles from Tehran. News from Azerbaijan Province is that a Soviet cavalry unit is advancing in a fan shape towards Iran from the city of Astara on the Caspian coast. Well-equipped Soviet troops have entered Mianeh, Maragheh, and Miyandoab near the southern end of Lake Urmia. The lake is located near the border between Iraq and Turkey. In addition, according to our news: A broadcast from London on the 13th reports that Iranian Ambassador to the Soviet Union Al-Haji said today that Soviet pressure on Turkey has moved beyond the stage of a war of nerves, and fighting is expected to break out soon on the Turkish border. Also, according to a United Press report from Washington on the 12th: According to information obtained by the U.S. State Department, more Soviet troops and heavy weapons have recently moved from the Soviet border through Greater Britain towards Tehran. From these reports, it can be seen that the Soviet military operations from the Turkish-Iraqi border to northern Iran are clearly a planned and large-scale operation. Its intention does not seem to be limited to Iran, but actually includes a vast area from Turkey to Iran.

Regarding the Iranian issue, Britain and the United States have submitted notes to the Soviet Union several times, and even raised it at the first session of the United Nations Security Council. The Security Council held four days of heated debate on the Iranian issue, and finally decided that the Soviet Union and Iran should engage in direct negotiations. However, this decision did not resolve the problem in Iran. The Soviet troops' occupation of northern Iran was originally a necessary measure for fighting the Axis powers. Now that the war is over, they should withdraw and allow Iran to freely exercise its political power. However, not only have Soviet troops not withdrawn, they have recently been carrying out divisive activities in Azerbaijan Province, further complicating the situation in Iran. Now that the United Nations Security Council has decided that the Soviet Union and Iran should engage in direct negotiations, and the current Iranian government cannot be tolerated by the Soviet Union, direct negotiations have not made progress. The Soviet troops' current advance into Iran, as the Associated Press of Washington said on the 13th, is aimed at forcing Iran to establish a pro-Soviet government and consolidate its border strategic zone.

However, the scope of this Soviet troop advance is not limited to Iran, but also includes the Turkish border and the Iraqi border. The Soviet Union's dispute with Turkey and Iraq is ostensibly over the issue of Kurdish autonomy and the demand to "recover lost border territories." Although the Soviet Union is ostensibly an outsider in the issue of Kurdish autonomy, behind-the-scenes involvement cannot be ruled out. Recovering lost border territories is settling old scores, and Turkey will certainly not easily transfer or divide its territory. Moreover, the problem here is not that simple. The Iraqi port of Basra has access to the Indian Ocean, and the area has rich oil fields. Turkey controls the Dardanelles Strait, the gateway from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean Sea. This Soviet military action is more of an attempt to exert pressure on Turkey to obtain the rights to the Dardanelles Strait and force Turkey and Iraq to establish pro-Soviet regimes than an attempt to recover lost border territories.

The problem in the Middle East appears in Iran, Iraq, and Turkey; but in fact, there is only one: a powerful neighbor is attempting to establish regimes in these areas that are favorable to itself by force. This clearly violates the principle of national self-determination. If this policy is realized, then the principles for which countless people sacrificed in the Great War will be abandoned, and the world will return to a dark age. Therefore, the situation in the Middle East is not a question of Anglo-Soviet rivalry, but a more important question: the self-determination and survival of nations, and the question of the strong bullying the weak. For this question, humanity had this Great War; now that the war has just ended, this question is appearing everywhere, from the Mediterranean Sea, Central Europe, through the Near East, to the Northeast on the Pacific coast. The recent developments in the Middle East deserve attention; they harbor danger. China, having experienced a long war of resistance, feels especially keenly about the indivisibility of war. A single spark can start a prairie fire. How to save humanity from another catastrophe depends on the great demeanor of the current leaders.

### Consistent Anglo-American Public Opinion Criticizes Stalin's Remarks; Deems Stalin's Words Coarse and Unreasonable; His Actions Resemble Hitler's

America

[Central News Agency, New York, 13th Dispatch] Following Stalin's attack on Churchill's speech, the New York Times published an editorial stating: "If the Soviet Union truly wishes to provide Churchill with an effective response, Moscow should adhere to the guarantees, agreements, and treaties it has made with other countries. In doing so, the entire international tension would immediately vanish." The New York Times further reminded the Soviet Union that it would be mistaken if it believed that the hesitation expressed by the U.S. Congress towards Churchill's speech presented an opportunity to divide Anglo-American friendship.

England

[Reuters, London, 14th Dispatch] The Conservative Party's Daily Mail and the Daily Chronicle both criticized Stalin's remarks to a Pravda reporter this morning. The Daily Mail stated: "Marshal Stalin's personal abuse of Churchill is despicable and regrettable. These are not the words of a statesman. One can judge a person by their words. He has little to say about the current international crisis, and can only explain the world's tension as being caused by the Soviet Union's power politics and aggression towards its neighbors, but this does not absolve the Soviet Union of its responsibility. The Soviet Union's actions are comparable to the situation before World War III. The situation in Iran has reverted to the European political landscape of 1938-1939. The Czech Republic back then is today's Iran, the only difference being that today's developments are happening faster. The Soviet Union's actions are even worse than those of pre-war Germany. Hitler allowed for the respect of the borders agreed upon at the Munich Conference, yet six months later, he sent troops into Bohemia and Moravia; the Soviet Union agreed to withdraw its troops from Iran simultaneously with Britain, yet it broke its promise. Hitler and Stalin share another unfortunate similarity: both use security as an excuse to justify their acts of aggression. Who can attack the Soviet Union?"

The Daily Chronicle stated: "Only British diplomatic skills and the moral pressure of the United Nations organization can prevent another war. Unfortunately, Stalin's attack on Churchill has not alleviated the tension. Stalin's words are coarse and unreasonable. It must be understood that abuse cannot answer the points raised by Churchill. His comparison of Churchill to Hitler is simply unbelievable and is not the attitude expected of one of the three great leaders who fought against Germany."

### White House Secretary Denies Three-Power Conference Rumors

[Central News Agency, Washington, 13th Dispatch, United Press] Truman's press secretary, Ross, stated today that rumors that President Truman is planning another three-power conference are "not very accurate." These rumors originated from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's expression of willingness to discuss the tense relations with Byrnes, and a secret meeting held with former Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Harriman. Reporters asked Ross about the following rumors: (1) Is the President planning to find a way to convene a three-power conference? (2) Has the President spoken with Prime Minister Attlee by telephone? Is he planning to speak directly with Stalin? (3) If the Soviet Union does not withdraw its troops from Iran, will the United States sever diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union? Ross did not answer any of these questions.

[Reuters, London, 14th Dispatch] British Members of Parliament have asked Prime Minister Attlee to reply as to whether he intends to initiate a three-power conference. The Prime Minister stated that he would take any steps that could improve relations between the major powers, but that it was not appropriate to take any measures at present.

Furthermore, the Italian and Slovenian Alliance Committee yesterday submitted a memorandum to the United Nations Investigation Committee, urging Yugoslavia to merge the entire Trieste area and the Province of Isonzo in order to form the ninth state of the Yugoslav Federation.

### UNRRA Convenes Meeting to Discuss Future Relief Plans; Hoover May Succeed Director

[United Press, Washington, 13th Dispatch] Representatives from the 47 member countries of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) are scheduled to meet on Friday in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The main issue for discussion will be whether the European relief program can be extended to next year. UNRRA's relief funds will be completely exhausted by next March, and all relief funds for January, February, and March of next year have been designated entirely for the countries of the Far East, especially China. UNRRA is now seeking to avoid asking the United Nations to make a third donation, as the U.S. Congress may not be willing to make a third consecutive annual donation of $1.35 billion. If this Atlantic City meeting does not find a solution to this matter, it may be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly. Another hope is that if the International Bank can be established in a timely manner, it may be able to release loans for food and reconstruction by the end of this year.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 13th Dispatch] UNRRA Director Lehman has submitted his resignation yesterday due to poor health.

### US Celebrities Meet to Discuss Revising the UN Charter; Plan to Establish a World Federal Government

[United Press, Winter Park, Florida, 13th Dispatch] Approximately 20 prominent figures from the American scientific, industrial, religious, literary, educational, and labor communities are meeting here, with the aim of reviewing how to revise the United Nations Charter in order to establish a world "Federal Government." The matters discussed at the meeting all arose from concerns about the horrors of atomic warfare.

The generation and maintenance of world peace can only be achieved through world law, the effectiveness of which must be extensive and strong enough to prevent war between nations. Therefore, to ensure our survival, we must unite with other nations to establish a world constitutional federal government, giving it the necessary strength to maintain world peace in general based on legal justice." The representatives then passed a resolution stating that the best way to achieve this goal is to start by revising the United Nations Charter. One representative suggested establishing a world parliament and a world court within the United Nations organization, as well as another world organization to arrest and prosecute those who violate world law.

### Suspect in the Du Gang Murder Case: Huang Liewen Denies Collaborating with the Enemy and Claims to Have Served the Nation; Ms. Zhang Yulin Witnessed the Secret Report; More Than Ten Knife Wounds on the Head and Back, Right Hand Severed

Du's Wife Recounts Her Grief, Sobbing Incoherently

[Our Newspaper's Report] The late former Municipal Party Committee Member and Secretary-General Du Gang, courtesy name Shaowen, held important Party and government positions during the Anti-Japanese War, traveling extensively. In the spring of the 32nd year of the Republic, he was secretly ordered to come to Shanghai to plan work, but unfortunately, the enemy discovered his presence. On November 10th of that year, he and his wife, Lu Huimin, were arrested at their residence at No. 28, Lane 672, Pushi Road, and imprisoned in the enemy's Bédan Road Gendarmerie. They were subjected to torture to extract confessions. Martyr Du remained steadfast and unyielding, and was killed on November 17th, heroically sacrificing his life for his country. His wife was later released. After the victory, it was discovered that Huang Liewen was suspected of collaborating with the enemy, so he was arrested and transferred to the Higher Procuratorate for investigation, and a formal public prosecution has been initiated. Huang Liewen is a native of Songjiang, 38 years old. In his early years, he held high-ranking positions in the central military and political circles. During the Anti-Japanese War, he was ordered to come to Shanghai to recruit students from the 20th class of the military academy. He had a

Brief Encounter

with Du in Tunxi. After coming to Shanghai to work, he was arrested and imprisoned by the enemy gendarmerie, and released after six months. He then remained in Shanghai. In the 33rd year of the Republic, he was appointed as the puppet Qingpu County Magistrate through the introduction of Zhou Fohai, and remained in that position until the victory. Du's arrest and martyrdom were due to Huang's secret report, as witnessed by Ms. Zhang Yulin. Because of the meritorious service of the secret report, in addition to being appointed as the county magistrate, Huang was also rewarded by the enemy gendarmerie with a residence, a car, rice flour, and other items. During the court session yesterday afternoon in the Special Criminal Court of the High Court, when Judge Cai Jin opened the court to question the defendant, he

Eloquently Denied

that he had ever secretly reported against Du Gang. He claimed that after being arrested and released in Shanghai, he was under surveillance and could not escape. The enemy and the puppet regime had repeatedly coerced him to reveal the whereabouts of underground work leaders Jiang Bocheng, Wu Shaoshu, and Du Gang, but he always claimed that they were in Tunxi. "I don't know Du Gang's residence at all, so how could I have made a secret report? As for serving as the puppet Qingpu County Magistrate, I obtained the consent of the responsible authorities. I used my position to protect underground work. I set up the communication radio station of the Third War Area inside the county government, and also reorganized the local puppet security team into the Third War Area's Pioneer Army. Furthermore, I persuaded the reorganization of troops in Jinshan and Songjiang counties. At the same time, I successively released more than one hundred underground work comrades who had been arrested and imprisoned. This can be investigated. If Martyr Du was indeed killed by me, I am willing to commit suicide in court to apologize to the people of the country." At the same time, he also requested that Lieutenant Colonel Sugihara and Lieutenant Miyamoto, the commanders of the enemy gendarmerie on Bédan Road, be summoned as witnesses. Then, Du Lu Huimin gave a detailed account of

The Ordeal of Suffering

stating that Ms. Zhang Yulin had witnessed the defendant making a secret report. When she described the tragic state of Martyr Du's body after his death, with dozens of knife wounds on his head and back, and his right hand severed, she was overcome with grief, burst into tears, and sobbed incoherently. Because Zhang Yulin had not arrived, after the court summoned Shen Zhiyan, an underground worker who had been rescued and released by Huang Liewen, it ordered that the case still needed to be investigated and adjourned the hearing to another date.

### Four Cases of Fang Jie et al.

Fang Jie, a political section member of the Special High Section of the Puppet Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, had helped the enemy arrest members of the Pinghu Loyal Salvation Army and members of the Kuomintang party who broadcast this news on the Huangpu Radio Station immediately after the victory. During the court session yesterday, the victims Kong Shanghou, Cai Zhijun, Zhu Liwen, and Liu Baochun came to court to recount their experiences. The defendant hired lawyer Jiang Bao to defend him. The court ordered the case to be adjourned to another date for further hearing.

Yesterday morning, the High Court also heard the case of Wang Mingqian, Jin Yunsheng, Wu Quangen, and Qiao Shulin, who were accused of serving as secret agents for the Bédan Road enemy gendarmerie. The defendants were reported by Qiao Liangbo, Zhu Xiqing, Chen Dongguo, Qiao Junshan, Zhu Hanchen, and other villagers from the Beiqiao District of Shanghai County. After questioning, the court ordered the case to be adjourned to another date for further hearing.

Furthermore, the case of Zhao Riliang, the head of the Ideological Section of the Special High Section of the Puppet Weihaiwei Police Bureau in Shandong and the deputy director of the Puppet Dinghai County Police Bureau, was debated in court yesterday afternoon. The defendant hired lawyer Wang Shouan to defend him. The court ordered the debate to be concluded and the verdict to be announced on the 21st in the afternoon.

The verdict in the case of Lin Zhixing, the translator for the Zhenru enemy gendarmerie, will be announced this afternoon.

### Shanghai Military Tribunal Extends Trial Date

[Our Newspaper's Report] The First Pacification Headquarters was ordered to organize the Shanghai Military Tribunal and has selected the original site of the Third Front Army Headquarters at the end of North Sichuan Road as its office. Dr. Liu Shifang, the presiding judge of the High Court, has been appointed as the presiding judge, and Qu Shize and others have been designated as judges, and Lin Wopeng and others as prosecutors. The original plan was to establish the tribunal and begin operations today, but due to the impact of the water and woodworkers' strike, the interior has not yet been fully repaired. Therefore, the formal trial of war criminals must be held after the 20th. It is rumored that the first batch of those to be tried are six Japanese prisoners reported by Fang Er in Wuxi.

### Miki Sui Spared from Death, Sentenced to 25 Years Imprisonment

[Our Newspaper's Report] Miki Sui, a Japanese war criminal who previously served as a administrator at a U.S. military concentration camp near Shenyang, was sentenced to twenty-five years imprisonment and hard labor by the U.S. military court yesterday. The sentencing lasted only three minutes. However, the charge of murdering American naval prisoners of war named Zhong could not be established due to insufficient evidence. Therefore, his crimes were only of mistreatment and abuse of prisoners of war. Before hearing the verdict, Miki's face was pale, and he showed obvious signs of fear and trepidation. After the verdict was pronounced, although he was calmer, his fear and tension still remained.

### A Traitorous Puppet Officer in Zhenhai Arrested

Wang Zuying, a native of Zhenhai, formerly served as a detective in the Puppet Zhenhai Police Bureau. He colluded with puppet officers to search Gu Chongwen's home, a resident of the Jiangnan Xiaodaotou area of Zhenhai, and confiscated ten self-defense rifles and four hundred rounds of ammunition from the fields, which were handed over to the puppet security team to strengthen the enemy and puppet forces. After the victory, he fled to Shanghai to evade justice. Unexpectedly, he encountered Gu at the 16th Pier on the 5th of this month and was taken to the Yimiao Sub-bureau. It is now known that he has been transferred to the High Court Procuratorate for legal action.

### The Huge Embezzlement Case at Guanda Hua Bank on the Bund is Solved

[Our Newspaper's Report] At Guanda Hua Bank, No. 1 The Bund, on the evening of the 6th of last month, the glass windows along Zhongzheng Road were broken, and several thieves broke in. They dug open the silver safe and stole US$59,200 in banknotes, 45 gold bars weighing a total of 63 taels and 8 fen, and 21 pieces of gold jewelry, among other items. After the bank reported the case to the police, Zhuo Qingbao, the chief of the Second Criminal Division, ordered his officers to solve the case as soon as possible. On the morning of the 7th of this month, a thief named Yang Amao was arrested at No. 607 Guangdong Road. On the evening of the 8th, another accomplice, Liu Sanbao (27 years old, from Ningbo), was arrested at No. 10, Lane 3, Menghua Street, in the South City. Wang Xiugen (26 years old, from Pudong) was arrested at No. 132 Qiujiang Road. Another suspect, Fang Abing (27 years old, from Anhui), was also apprehended. One-quarter of the stolen goods were recovered, including US$9,040 in banknotes, one large gold ingot weighing eight taels, two small gold ingots, each weighing one tael, two gold bracelets, three gold rings, and more than 260 pieces of gray leather, divided into five bundles. It is reported that there are still two accomplices at large, and the investigation is ongoing.

### Negotiations to Purchase 10,000 Prefabricated Houses - There is Such a Saying

The housing shortage in this city is extremely serious, and there is currently no appropriate solution, which often leads to disputes between landlords and tenants. According to a report by the New Shanghai News Agency, there are 10,000 prefabricated houses among the surplus materials of the US military in the Pacific, and the Chinese government is currently formally negotiating with the US government to purchase them. It is reported that most of them will be used in Nanjing and Shanghai to provide housing for civil servants after the return to the capital. If this is the case, the housing shortage problem in Nanjing and Shanghai may be slightly alleviated.

### The Truth About the Seductive Corpse Case on the Roof of the Taishan Apartments Comes to Light

Reliving Old Dreams · Jealousy Arouses Waves · A Life Lost · The Accomplices Are Captured After Many Twists and Turns; the Main Culprit is Still at Large

[Our Newspaper's Report] On the afternoon of the 10th, a seductively dressed female corpse was discovered on the roof of the fourth floor of the Taishan Apartments, No. 3, Lane 622, Xiafei Road. Detailed reports have been published in this newspaper, and the incident caused a sensation in society and was considered a strange event. The responsible Lujiawan Police Station attached great importance to the case and sent out detectives day and night to investigate. Within more than forty hours, the accomplices were captured, and the main culprit is at large. A summary of the situation is as follows:

On the day the case occurred, the Lujiawan Sub-bureau received a report and Deputy Director Li Junhou personally led Inspector Xue Minjie, Ni Jiafeng, staff member Ma Bingzhang, Police Chief Zhang Jun, and others to the scene to conduct a detailed investigation. They studied the victim's injuries and examined the type of bullet casings. A staff member recognized the deceased as someone he had met at a banquet once, only remembering that she lived near Carter Road, but not knowing the number. After searching for several hours, they finally located her husband, Yue Nianzhao, at No. 33, Lane 146, Carter Road. At that time, Yue was not yet aware of his wife, Chen Huifang's, tragic death. According to Yue, he was unemployed, and his livelihood was becoming increasingly difficult. Huifang, forced by economic circumstances, returned to her previous profession as a prostitute at the Red Pearl Brothel in Huile Lane on the 24th of the old calendar year, using the name "Old Seventh."

Therefore, the police officers followed this lead and went directly to the Red Pearl Brothel to investigate in detail. According to the madam, a Mr. Chen came to the brothel for tea last Thursday. Before leaving, he summoned Old Seventh and said, "I will host a party here tomorrow. Please prepare dishes." Unexpectedly, at 5:00 the next day, Mr. Chen suddenly called, saying that his arm was broken and the party would be postponed. Old Seventh was immediately displeased upon hearing this. Then, her friend Lin Buwu (also known as Yiming) invited her to meet at the Great China Cafe, and Wang Zhengzhong and two people surnamed Bu came to the brothel to "have some fun." She also called Xue and Zhang to join the banquet. When the guests dispersed, Lin borrowed 30,000 yuan from Bu to pay for the feast. Two days later, Old Seventh suddenly went out and never returned.

Inspector Ni and others knew that to solve this case, they had to start with the brothel. Therefore, they repeatedly visited the brothel after the case occurred to investigate. At 6:00 PM on the 11th, when they went again, Xue happened to call, inviting Seventh to have coffee at the Great China Cafe. The police officers immediately rushed to the Great China Cafe and captured Xue. After questioning, it was learned that Wang and Lin were highly suspicious, but their addresses were unknown. They only learned that Lin was cohabiting with a woman named Lin Huiying, and Huiying's sister lived on Father Du Road. After going there, they found Huiying's sister, and thus learned that Lin was at No. 27, Yi'an Village, Yidingpan Road in West Shanghai.

The next day, the police officers went to Yi'an Village and knocked on the door of the landlord of No. 27, who said that Mr. Lin and his family planned to go to Suzhou this morning. At this time, Wang and Lin suddenly entered the alley together. Xue identified them without error. Staff member Ma Bingzhang bravely held on to Wang, who tried to draw his gun but failed. He was then struck hard by Inspector Ni, and the gun fell to the ground. He was captured on the spot. Lin Yiming managed to escape into the crowd. The police officers took everyone to the station and interrogated them closely, finally understanding the details of this murder case.

It turned out that Xue was Old Seventh's former lover. Meeting again after a long time, they were both surprised and delighted. Xue asked Seventh why she was there. Seventh told him that her husband, Nianzhao, was unemployed, leaving her with no choice. That night, after leaving the brothel, Xue and Seventh went to a hotel for a rendezvous. Therefore, Lin and Wang expressed deep dissatisfaction with Seventh. They agreed to have tea somewhere the next morning to discuss a plan to deal with her. The idea of killing Seventh had already arisen in their minds.

The next day, Lin and Wang went to Taishan Apartments first and lingered for a long time, then went back separately. At around 1:00 PM on the 10th, they agreed to have lunch at the Dasanyuan Restaurant on Xizang Road, and also called Old Seventh, who suspected nothing and happily went. After eating, Lin and Wang took Seventh in three rickshaws to Taishan Apartments, claiming they were visiting friends. They went straight to the flat roof on the fourth floor. Seeing that there was no one around, Lin took out a gun and fired. The first shot missed, but a bullet was fired and hit her face, killing her. At that time, Seventh was wearing two diamond rings, one large ring weighing 60 points, and a small ring with four diamond heads, as well as 7,000 yuan in legal tender, all of which were snatched by Lin and taken away. The two men took a bus to a jewelry store on Hankou Road and sold the large diamond ring for 350,000 yuan in foreign currency. The small one was sold to a store on Jiangxi Road for 150,000 yuan in legal tender. Lin gave Wang 30,000 yuan. On the 11th, Wang went to Wang's residence at No. 27, Yi'an Village, Yidingpan Road for lunch. Lin gave him another 70,000 yuan and told him to keep the matter a secret.

On the morning of the 12th, Lin saw that the Shen Bao had reported the murder case at Taishan Apartments. He immediately told the landlord that he planned to go to Suzhou and took the newspaper to visit Wang at No. 161 Yaozhujiao Road, telling him that the matter had been exposed and discussing their escape together. Lin and Wang returned to Yi'an Village and prepared to pack everything and leave, but they were arrested there. According to Wang's confession, Lin, 37 years old, is from Fujian and graduated from the Guangdong Police Academy. He is currently a major detachment commander of the Second Brigade of the Security Regiment of the Kunshan County Government, skilled in marksmanship. Police officers also searched Lin's residence but found nothing of value. Deputy Director Li was afraid that he would flee to another location. He quickly went to the Baocheng Section of the Jing'an Temple Sub-bureau and issued Lin's portrait, sending police to guard the military station. Although he has not yet been apprehended, he will eventually be brought to justice.

### Labor Department Hosts Reporters, Reports on Materials Clearing Situation; $20 Million in US Materials to be Sold to Our Country; Mayor Qian Hosts Labor Department for a Wash-Dust Banquet at His Private Residence Yesterday

[Our Newspaper's Report] The US military surplus materials investigation team, organized by US Undersecretary of the Army Labor and McKieber, Special Commissioner of the Overseas Clearing Committee, held talks with the US military authorities stationed in China at the Construction Building on the eighth floor yesterday morning. After the meeting at 11:20, they continued to host reporters from various newspapers in this city to report on the situation of overseas material clearing. Undersecretary Labor, McKieber, Lieutenant General Luo Ci, Commander of the US Army Service Team, Major General Parks, Director of the Army Liaison Office, and Major General Johnson, President of the Overseas Clearing Committee in China, attended and answered various questions.

Investigating Surplus Materials in War Zones

Labor said that the main task of the investigation team is to inspect the surplus materials of the US military in various war zones in the Pacific. After the US military's remaining items are officially designated as surplus materials, the Overseas Clearing Committee is responsible for handling and selling them. If there are items needed by the United States, they will still be transported back. Some munitions can also be sold, but there are still some military weapons that are dangerous in nature, so they have been thrown into the sea.

The Clearing Committee Assists in Transportation

It is quite difficult to estimate the total value of the surplus materials in the Pacific region. However, there are US$25 million worth of materials in Calcutta that will be sold to China in full. The priority for purchasing surplus materials is first for US government agencies, second for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and then for China. Currently, in addition to China, the Netherlands and New Zealand have also requested to purchase, but the amount is small. The Soviet Union has not yet applied. As for transportation, it should be handled by the purchasing country, but the Clearing Committee has decided to try its best to assist. Labor and others are scheduled to leave here today for Manila to continue their inspection. Mayor Qian Dajun held a cocktail party at his private residence on Jisi Feier Road at 5:30 yesterday afternoon to welcome Labor and others.

US Reporter Group Participates in Inspection

The US reporter group that recently arrived in Shanghai, including Weishunai of the New York Times, Kleinai of the New York Free Forum, Clark of the Chicago Tribune, McKenorton of Time Magazine, and Hanley of the International News Service, hosted reporters from this city at the Construction Building on the eighth floor at 4:00 PM yesterday. Hutyat of Columbia Broadcasting Corporation did not attend, and Dillon of the United Press flew to Chongqing for a trip. They said that their mission was entrusted by the US Army and Navy authorities to inspect the surplus materials in various regions of the Pacific in order to report. The trip will last for a total of three weeks. This trip has no connection with the arrival of Undersecretary of the Army Labor and others. They also said that there are actually not many surplus materials in the Chinese region, but it is a good market for selling surplus materials in the Pacific. The US has already sold US$8.7 million worth of surplus materials to China. There are many US military surplus materials on the island of Okinawa, and efforts will be made to transport them to China for sale. The reporter group is scheduled to leave here for Manila on the morning of the 16th.

### The "Base Salary" of the City's Mayor is 800 Yuan Per Month: A List of Salary Levels for Civil Servants

[Our Newspaper's Report] The salaries of civil servants were previously adjusted by the Executive Yuan, with a base salary multiplied by 130, plus a living allowance of 40,000 yuan, but this official document has not yet been approved. According to speculation from relevant parties, it may be changed again. Currently, the salaries of municipal government employees are still calculated based on a base salary multiplied by 100, plus a living allowance of 30,000 yuan. The salary levels are listed below:

Specially Appointed

Mayor: The base salary is 800 yuan per month.

Senior

Level 1 (such as bureau chiefs and department heads with the same status as each bureau): The monthly salary is 680 yuan. The senior level is divided into eight levels, ranging from 430 yuan to 680 yuan, with a difference of 30 yuan between each level.

Recommended

Divided into twelve levels, ranging from 180 yuan to 400 yuan, with a difference of 20 yuan between each level. The highest level for section chiefs is Level 1 recommended.

Entrusted

(Below section member) Divided into sixteen levels, ranging from 140 yuan to 200 yuan, with a difference of 20 yuan between each level. From 110 yuan to 140 yuan, the difference is 10 yuan between each level. From 55 yuan to 100 yuan, the difference is 5 yuan between each level. Senior section members belong to the recommended level. Section chiefs and above are given an additional office allowance of 1,500 yuan to 8,000 yuan per month. There is also an entertainment expense, which is determined based on each person's duties. The salaries of workers range from 30 yuan to 40 yuan.

In addition, for municipal government affiliated agencies (such as hospitals belonging to the Health Bureau), the highest senior level is 520 yuan, starting from 430 yuan, with a difference of 30 yuan per level. The recommended level ranges from 220 yuan to 400 yuan, with a difference of 20 yuan between each level. The entrusted level ranges from 110 yuan to 200 yuan, with 20 yuan per level. From 90 yuan to 100 yuan, the difference is 10 yuan per level. The appointed level ranges from 55 yuan to 85 yuan, with a difference of 5 yuan per level.

### Torrential Rain, Forming Lines for Petitioning: Labor Disputes in Hotels and Water/Wood Industries Resolved; Hotel Tea Servers' Wages Increased by 60%; Water/Wood Workers Decide to Resume Work Today

[Our Report] After two rounds of mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, the hotel labor dispute has been resolved, and 15,000 tea servers will resume work at 1:00 PM. The reconciliation record will be signed at 10:00 AM today. The details are as follows:

Waiting in the Rain, Finally Resolved

Yesterday morning at 8:30 AM, more than 8,000 hotel workers, holding high banners inscribed with "Hotel Industry Workers' Union," marched to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition, demanding a 70% increase in wages based on their original salaries. To show their sincerity, all workers did not use umbrellas, standing in the torrential rain without flinching. However, the employers believed that not every hotel's room rates had increased by 70%, so wages could not be increased uniformly. Later, Director Gu Bingyuan of the Social Affairs Bureau persuaded them, promising that the labor representatives' wages could be increased by 60%, and the issue of hotel room rates would be discussed again in the afternoon. All the tea servers were satisfied, so they resumed work in the afternoon. However, when discussing room rates at 4:00 PM, another change occurred. The police department representative believed that the wage increase was too high, and room rates would inevitably rise accordingly, placing too much burden on travelers. Therefore, the 60% increase was bound to be overturned again. But the labor side unanimously opposed it. After several discussions and debates, Director Gu finally resolved the issue, maintaining the original agreement of a 60% wage increase for tea servers, and allowing a 50% increase in hotel room rates. The mediation record will be signed at 10:00 AM today.

The Bureau Decides on Temporary Measures

[Our Report] The labor dispute in the water/wood industry has lasted for nearly a week. Because most workers have no food for the next day and rely on their daily wages to maintain their family's livelihood, they could not afford further delays. 100,000 workers in the city urgently sought a solution, and there were daily parades and petitions. Yesterday at 5:00 PM, thousands of workers, after waiting a long time for news of the five representatives attending negotiations at the Social Affairs Bureau, formed a line and rushed to the Social Affairs Bureau again. At that time, the rain was heavy, and the central square of the Social Affairs Bureau quickly became a sea of umbrellas. The workers demanded that the Social Affairs Bureau resolve the issue immediately, but the four employer representatives believed that wages had already been adjusted (2,600 yuan per day), so the labor's demand of 6,300 yuan was difficult to accept. Moreover, there were many businesses in the industry, and they dared not agree hastily, maintaining a very firm attitude. The Social Affairs Bureau, seeing the seriousness of the situation and the workers' tense emotions, fearing changes would occur, took temporary measures. The Social Affairs Bureau ordered the workers to fully resume work starting today, and at the same time ordered the employers to pay a daily wage of 4,500 yuan before a formal resolution, with adjustments made after a formal decision. Both labor and management happily accepted this temporary solution, and the workers dispersed around 6:30 PM.

In addition, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works hired workers to repair roads and bridges, actively engaging in construction work. The water/wood industry union interfered and obstructed workers who had not joined the union from joining. After receiving a report, Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau sternly warned the union yesterday, stating that it must not interfere with or obstruct workers who have not joined the union, and must not take illegal actions against government personnel, otherwise, it will be severely punished.

Workers at the Waterworks Petition

A dozen foremen from the Yangshupu Waterworks went to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday to request mediation. When the Pacific War first broke out, the manager of the plant agreed with the workers that the workers would not leave their posts during the war, and the employers promised to pay each person a bonus of three months' salary after the war. However, after the victory, the employers suddenly went back on their word and did not fulfill their promise, so they requested the Social Affairs Bureau to assist in urging the employers to pay.

The Book Industry Employees Express Unconcern

The work slowdown at the Commercial Press has lasted for a long time without a resolution, causing unrest among employees of other bookstores such as Chung Hwa and World. They have jointly submitted a document to the Social Affairs Bureau, urging a quick resolution, otherwise, other businesses fear they will be affected.

### Military Vehicles in the City Allowed to Increase Speed; Pedestrians and Drivers Must Be Careful

[United Press] According to an announcement issued today by the China Theater Command: The command will begin a "Driving Safety" publicity program on the American military's Great American Radio Station, in order to reduce traffic accidents in the city. The Great American Radio Station will broadcast various programs daily to urge pedestrians and drivers to be especially careful, as all military vehicles are now authorized to drive at a speed of 18 miles per hour. It is said that the speed limit for American military vehicles was previously set at 13 miles per hour, but due to structural reasons, the above speed easily damaged the vehicles. In order to alleviate this difficulty, the municipal government has agreed to change the speed limit to 18 miles per hour.

Hai Zhou Ship Sails to Taiwan on Monday

[Our Report] In order to accelerate transportation between Shanghai and Taiwan, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company dispatched the Hai Xiang ship, which was later reassigned to Qingdao, and then dispatched the Hai Yu and Hai Zhou ships to join the route. The Hai Yu is scheduled to set sail tomorrow, and the Hai Zhou is scheduled to sail to Taiwan on the 18th. As for the He Bei ship, it is currently unloading cargo, and the sailing date is undetermined. It is heard that the Taiwan Provincial Administrative Office, after negotiating with the company, has purchased tickets for the Hai Xiang and He Bei ships, and the staff members can transfer to the Hai Zhou ship to go to Taiwan without having to exchange tickets.

### Deed Tax and Land Tax to be Transferred to Special Collection; Inheritance Tax Difficult to Collect

The deed tax and land tax currently collected by the Municipal Bureau of Finance will be transferred to the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau for collection in the near future. The director of the bureau, Sun Zhaoxuan, will be transferred to the Jiangsu Direct Tax Bureau to replace Shi Shouchang. Shi is scheduled to take over next week. In addition, the collection of inheritance tax is extremely difficult because the household survey in the city has not yet been completed, and the registration of citizens' property has not been carried out. Therefore, the Direct Tax Bureau cannot investigate the deaths of citizens and their inheritance. Since its establishment, the collection of inheritance tax has not been developed, and the amount is very small.

### Increased Telephone Deposit: 7,500 Yuan Per Line

The American Shanghai Telephone Company will increase the telephone deposit for all users in March and April. The deposit is 7,500 yuan per line. To reduce the burden on users, it will be collected in two installments, 3,750 yuan each in March and April. The amount will be included in the regular monthly bill to save procedures. Users can save the receipt for future refund applications.

### Far East International Military Tribunal May Open Next Month; Prosecutor Xiang Zhejunn Returns Home to Report on Work

As the deadline approaches, the judicial personnel of the District Court originally planned to hold a general assembly in the seventh civil division at 1:00 PM this afternoon to decide on future actions; however, when the representatives met at 10:00 AM yesterday morning, President Cha Liangjian personally attended and said that he had obtained the approval of Minister Xie of the Ministry of Justice and Administration, expressing that he would find ways to improve the employees' lives and welfare, and had drafted concrete measures and submitted them for approval and implementation.

It is heard that all employees will still work as usual today, but they are still continuing to request basic adjustment measures.

The Samwater, an agent ship of Tiansheng Yangxing, arrived in Shanghai yesterday. As for Italy's shipping industry in China, there is no hope of resumption at present.

### The Name of the Killed Fish Vendor Was Mistakenly Reported

(Correction) Yesterday's report in this newspaper about the tragic death of a fish vendor who was killed by thieves stated that the deceased had no name, and Jiang Dingou was a doctor at Renji Hospital. The fish vendor was shot in the right front chest, and the bullet penetrated the heart and did not come out, so he died when he was sent to the hospital. The surname could not be obtained. The duty doctor, Jiang, signed a form to prove the death, which was mistakenly reported as the name of the fish vendor.

### Shanghai Briefs

Yang Xizhi, the Shanghai municipal food administration official of our country who attended the fourth meeting of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, took the Truth and Freedom weekly to the 6th meeting at 9:30 yesterday morning. The sixth issue was originally scheduled to be published on the 5th of this month, but has been delayed until now due to the labor dispute. This issue includes 15 articles such as "Why the CPPCC Succeeded and Prices Increased" by Yue Guang, "Cutting Military Spending to Move to Scientific Research" by Peng Ruifu, and "My Views on Democracy" by Shaw translated by Huang Jiali. The content is very exciting.

### Gold Buyers Hesitate, Rationing Surprisingly Effective, Exchange Rate Still Not Moving

Yesterday, the gold market continued to decline. The Central Bank of China (CBC) sold 175 gold bars at a price of 1.6 million, and some peers even refused to accept it. Moreover, this price remained valid for the day, closing the door to any further increase. Buyers hesitated and the market was very quiet. Opening flat in the morning at 1.63 million, the supply kept coming, and the price retreated to the range of 1.6 million. After 10:00 AM, it was still struggling below 1.59 million. The industry was hesitant about the registered rationing, and very few people registered. The CBC set a price slightly higher than the market price, stating that those who needed it could reserve it until this afternoon, otherwise, they would listen to them. Therefore, it was suppressed by the supply side, and buyers had no interest and just watched. At noon, it had fallen slightly to around 1.55 million. The market stabilized slightly in the afternoon, hovering around 1.57 million. There were not many transactions, and the final result was about 60,000 lower than the previous day. Silver jewelry was listed at 170,000 yuan, standard silver at 1,600, and silver dollars were slightly lower and sold at 900 yuan. The underground exchange rate eased, and the interest rate ranged from 1.5 to 2 cents.

Foreign currencies were also sluggish. The US dollar followed the gold price down, starting at 2,050 yuan in the morning, but it was difficult to see any signs of recovery. At noon, it was approaching the 2,000 yuan mark before stabilizing slightly. The afternoon was the same, and the result was a further decline of 20 yuan. Hong Kong dollars also softened yesterday due to unfavorable conditions. The supply of Hong Kong telegrams turned abundant, and old tickets also carried a small 5 yuan, while new goods were flat. The CBC did not change the exchange rate. Hong Kong dollars were 420 yuan to 435 yuan, and rupees were 520 yuan to 540 yuan, and supply and demand gradually reached equilibrium.

Statistics on the Central Bank of China's Sale of Gold Bars

From last Thursday to yesterday, the Central Bank of China (CBC) sold a total of 2,283 gold bars at a highest price of 1.75 million yuan and a lowest price of 1.65 million yuan, shrinking the currency circulation by as much as 458.85 million yuan. The sales target was 63 gold and silver shops that are members of the Gold Industry Association. If gold is needed, the application for the purchase amount must be filled out with the Central Bank of China every day at 10:00 AM, and the payment must be made before noon after the Central Bank of China has approved it, to avoid speculation in the market. For example, yesterday, the Central Bank of China applied for 175 bars at a price of 1.6 million yuan. Seeing that the market absorption was very weak and there were people selling, there was a request to cancel the purchase. The gold market also became more and more sluggish. The price in the morning fell from 1.63 million yuan to 1.5 million yuan, and then recovered slightly by 450,000 yuan in the afternoon.

### Unpopular Small Stocks Are Uniquely Popular

Government Bonds Fall Again, Foreign Stocks Also Flat and Weak

Government bonds initially stabilized and then weakened. After the industry bulls raised prices, they all emerged, so C bonds declined from the 20 yuan mark in the morning to within 1800 yuan at noon. As a result, miscellaneous brands did not rise or fall much, and C bonds fell back by 50 yuan. Chinese stocks hovered at their peaks, which is a normal phenomenon after consecutive days of gains. Large investors supplied more than demanded, and some people switched from hot stocks to the second hottest and small stocks. At the same time, small stocks such as Xinguang worked hard on their own and had a great potential to catch up. Yongsha opened at 4,000 yuan in the morning, Meiya at 3,000, and Jingfu at 200 yuan. After opening, they once fell back by 50%. Xinguang gradually advanced from 170 yuan, and Qinxing got a lot of help from it. After the floating capital abandoned gold and banknotes, there was no way out, and they soon returned again. Yongsha Meiya was able to restore its former glory. At noon, large stocks stabilized, and small stocks were still popular. Jingfu saw 215 yuan, Xinguang 200 yuan, and Qinxing 160 yuan before slightly calming down. The noon closing result was that large stocks were flat compared with the previous day, Jingfu rose by 7 yuan, Xinguang rose by 20 yuan alone, and Qinxing was the same. Unpopular small stocks are gradually being favored by people. In the afternoon, hot spot transactions were higher for the next day, and foreign stocks were affected by the softening of gold prices. Holders sold goods to lock in profits. The opening in the morning was flat, but it was difficult to sustain it. The noon closing was earlier than Chinese stocks, and the market was flat and weak. Compared with the previous closing, Yisha British United fell back a little due to being popular, and the other stocks were not much different.

### Yarn Sales Gradually Return to Normal, Textile and Construction Groups Bid

The yarn market yesterday still showed no sign of improvement. There were people supplying 20-count spot chips, but there were not many customers who needed them. In addition, the gold price fell again, so the prices of all yarn lines fell by another 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. The decline in 16-count Guangming was slower, only falling by 30,000 yuan. At noon, the Textile and Construction Company listed and tendered sales, from 1-count to 60-count, with a total of more than 20 types. It is heard that people in the industry are thinking calmly, so the buyers were not as enthusiastic as in the past. In addition, the Textile and Construction Company used a bidding method to recruit for two groups of 6-count and 10-count coarse yarn and 16-count and 20-count yarn for bidding. The bidding opened at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. The first group was won by the Gonghe Cotton Weaving Factory. Five companies bid for the second group, but none of them reached the company's minimum price, so there was no winner. This is also a new development in the yarn industry's buying and selling.

Yesterday, the New York cotton futures market reported a price increase of 18 points per pound, for a total of US$27.15. Long-term futures did not move, for a total of 26.55. Middling spot was 27.31. The local cotton transactions were reduced, because the gold and yarn prices continued to fall, and the Textile and Construction Company was hesitant and did not purchase. Only private yarn factories such as Shenxin Yarn Factory purchased a little, and the price was similar to the previous day.

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was affected by the rain, and the local customers were very few, and the trend was extremely mediocre.

### Spinning Interest is Good, More and More Resumptions of Work

There are currently 53 Chinese yarn factories in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui areas, with a total of 1.7 million spindles, 100,000 thread spindles, and 15,000 looms. Recently, the number of spindles that have been restarted has exceeded half, accounting for 55%, and the number of thread spindles accounts for 46%, but only 26% of the looms have been started. Most of the factories are in Shanghai, accounting for 35 factories, and the remaining 16 factories are in Wuxi, Changzhou, Jiangyin, Taicang, Jiading, Nantong, Chongming, and Haimen in Jiangsu Province, and only one factory each in Hangzhou and Wuhu in Zhejiang and Anhui Provinces. Among them, Shenxin No. 9 Factory has the most resumed yarn spindles, with 66,000 spindles. Hongzhang Factory has the most resumed thread spindles, with 9,600 spindles. Hongzhang also has the most looms resumed, with 594 looms. Comparing today's yarn price with the flower price, the difference is very large. If each piece of cotton yarn uses 360 catties of cotton, calculated according to the market price of cotton at 90,000 yuan per picul, plus processing costs, the cost of each piece of cotton yarn is less than 500,000 yuan. Recently, the market price of cotton yarn has been around 1 million yuan, which is enough to stimulate production, and it is expected that it will be fully resumed in the short term.

### 2,000 Tons of American Cotton Arrive

The Samwater, managed by Tiansheng Yangxing, arrived in Shanghai from New York yesterday, carrying 2,000 tons of cotton, a total of 8,000 bales, and unloaded it at Floating Pier 1617. The cotton was purchased by the American An Yangxing, and the ship was specially loaded with this cotton to China.

More than 32,000 bags of flour, more than 2,000 boxes of tea, and more than 3,200 pieces of native paper were loaded on the Taikoo Company's Jinan ship and shipped to Qingdao today. Among them, more than 11,000 bags of flour were relief supplies, and the rest were commodities.

### Rice Rises Again

The rice market yesterday tended to rise again due to the overcast and rainy weather. Japonica rice increased by 500 to 600 yuan, and indica rice was scarce, increasing by nearly 1,000 yuan. White yuan was rare and precious, and rose sharply. There was no formal market price. Flour showed a slightly weak trend, and soybeans also had few transactions. High-priced goods fell slightly by 500 to 600 yuan, and soybean cakes were still weak and light, falling again by a small 200 to 300 yuan. Shantou's appetite was still weak, and there were many crude oil goods, and it was unable to rise. It was firm in the morning and weak in the afternoon. Soybean oil goods were scarce and firm, and raw kernels were set. Wheat bran also seemed to be.

### World Wheat Production Drops Sharply

[Washington, D.C., U.S. Information Service, 14th] According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Foreign Agriculture Group: World wheat production in 1945 was 5,200,000,000 bushels, the smallest production since 1929, a decrease of 8% compared to 1944. The sharp drop in production was due to the general decline in production in all regions except North America and Asia. Although wheat production in North America and Asia was smaller than a year ago, it was above the standard. The place with the smallest production was in Europe, where the production in 1945 was only 1,035,000,000 bushels, a decrease of 36% compared to pre-war levels.

### Tea Stagnation, Prices Weak

In recent tea market conditions, buyers have adopted an attitude of selectively purchasing red and green tea varieties, so transactions have been weak and unable to rise for days. In terms of price, some profit-taking owners have competed to loosen their holds, and although prices once fell, the market atmosphere has continued to feel weak, and there are fears that the future may still soften.

### Shortage of Thin Tinplate

35-pound thin iron has always been regarded as a noble product in tinplate, but cigarette factories, monosodium glutamate factories, and pigment shops use more of it, and others only need it sporadically. The stock on the market is very shallow. Unexpectedly, recently, shoelace factories suddenly purchased several boxes, so the underlying goods in the market have tightened. It is difficult to ship overseas orders to Shanghai for a while, so those who have spot goods must wait for a good price to sell. Yesterday, single-linked products were offered at 500,000 yuan per box, and double-linked products with more sheets were sold at 600,000 yuan.

### The Rising Wind of Fuel Gradually Subsided

The coal market is gradually stabilizing, and there are no rises or falls in any goods. Market transactions have also declined a lot due to the rain. Even the popular white coal sieving blocks have few transactions. Only white coal juveniles and firewood charcoal have sporadic embellishments. There is a lot of anthracite coal slag flowing out from all parties. It is rumored that the production factories will have low-priced allocation news, which has led to a sluggish way out. However, in terms of selling prices, sellers are still trying to support it and are unwilling to sell it cheaply, and are still standing on the original plate.

### Industrial Raw Materials Arrive in Shanghai

The stock of industrial raw materials in the city is weak, so prices have risen sharply, especially caustic soda, bleaching essence, and red alum for tanning leather, etc., which are almost scarce due to their vast uses. It is heard that a batch of goods ordered from Calcutta recently has arrived in Shanghai, including caustic soda, pure alkali, bleaching powder essence, red alum, etc. from the Bu Neimen brand, so the market price of the above has been slightly weakened. However, according to actual needs, it is still insufficient.

### China Establishes Import Committee in New York

[New York News Agency, 13th] The Chinese government will establish a temporary Import Design Committee in New York, under the Supreme Economic Council, chaired by Dr. T.V. Soong. The committee's main task will be to determine the necessary import goods during the reconstruction period and to select the best sources of supply.

### Market Summary

Bricks, Tiles, and Lime: Although carpenters and masons have been on strike for days, market prices are still rising, due to continuous rain, poor production in the interior, and extremely limited supply sources.

Foreign Paper: Prices have been falling for days due to the arrival of numerous foreign shipping notifications. The supply of sugar is uninterrupted, and both buyers and sellers are taking a wait-and-see attitude, with no transactions taking place at any stall. Prices are the same as the previous day, but the market is very weak.

Cotton Products: 3901 and 901 Goose Brand undershirts are slightly higher by two to three thousand yuan. Xinhua 42 interlock shirts have also risen in price due to rumors of higher factory quotations.

Electricity-spun and foreign-spun fabrics have also fallen by three to four thousand yuan due to factory supply. Other items are down by one hundred to one hundred and fifty yuan.

### Dr. Y.C. James Yen Advocates Literacy Campaign

Expresses Opinions to Reporters in the United States

[U.S. News Agency, Washington, 13th] Dr. Y.C. James Yen, a famous Chinese educator, met with reporters at the home of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Douglas yesterday to discuss his work in promoting the mass literacy campaign in China. Dr. Yen pointed out that three hundred million Chinese people, or three-quarters of China's total population, have never received any formal education in the past.

Eliminate Illiteracy Completely Within the Next Ten Years

He said that to date, sixty million people have been educated and are now literate. He also stated, "We hope to completely eliminate illiteracy within the next ten years." Dr. Yen declared that the resolutions passed by the Chongqing Political Consultative Conference in January of this year would greatly benefit China's education, economy, and social progress. The purpose of the Consultative Conference is to guide China towards democracy. However, if the general public is impoverished and lacks literacy, then how can democracy be realized? If we want the people to live a reasonable life under a democratic system, then the primary goal of mass education must be to achieve it. Dr. Yen mentioned his meeting with President Truman at the White House on March 11, stating that the President was already somewhat aware of the Chinese mass education movement, but wished to know more details.

American Experts Come to China to Assist in the Implementation of Mass Education

Dr. Yen said that two years ago, he came to the United States on behalf of the Chinese government as a member of the Post-War Research Committee. He has recently begun to find ways to solve the problem of obtaining technical assistance from American agricultural and medical experts, who will soon go to China to assist in the implementation of the mass education movement. Although the specific methods have not yet been determined, he hopes that the experts will be able to travel. This Chinese educator stated that he hopes China can send a large number of young people to the United States for further study. Dr. Yen said that in medicine, public health, and agriculture, in particular, the United States has many technologies that can be applied to China, but the situation is slightly different in education, because the educational problems of the two countries are very different. Dr. Yen said that he personally plans to return to China within a month to continue his work in promoting the literacy campaign.

### Dr. Joseph Needham Lectures on Sino-British Scientific Cooperation

[Our City News] Professor Joseph Needham lectured at the Sino-British Cultural Association at 4:00 PM on the 14th of this month, stating: "In China, due to the difficult environment during the war, the situation when the British Council began its work was very special. In 1942, Britain sent Professor Dodds of Oxford University and the renowned scientist Dr. Joseph Needham to Free China to establish contact with universities and vocational schools. China's difficult environment left Chinese scientists isolated. Therefore, Dr. Needham, based on his past experience in Britain and the United States, established a Sino-British Science Co-operation Office in China. Initially, the office was financially supported by the British Council, but in fact, it was connected to the British Ministry of War Production and several British and American scientific societies. Now that the wartime work has ended, the two countries should continue to exchange cultures as much as possible in the spirit of mutual assistance and mutual benefit within the broader organization of the British Council."

### The National College of Commerce About to Relocate to Shanghai

— Fang Jingyao

During the Anti-Japanese War, there were many emerging and famous universities in the interior, and the National College of Commerce was one of them.

Those in charge of this college are Zhao Dihua, Hou Houpei, Cheng Ruilin, Zhang Boqin, Wu Gan and other economic figures. The scale of the College of Commerce is quite large: in the university department, it is divided into four departments: banking, accounting statistics, industrial and commercial management, and land economics, and is currently located in Qiancheng Suoli, Hunan. The branch department has two specialized courses in statistics, politics, and cooperation, which are located in Yuanling, Hunan.

The university department with four departments is a four-year system with a total of sixteen classes, and the branch department with two specialized courses is a two-year system with a total of four classes. There are more than 700 male and female students and nearly 50 professors, many of whom are scholars with excellent academic experience.

Due to the lack of materials and finances during the Anti-Japanese War, the school buildings and equipment of the College of Commerce were inevitably dilapidated like those of other universities. However, the spirit of those in charge of persevering and striving to expand is admirable. Therefore, the graduates of each session have excellent results and mostly serve in government agencies and well-known banks in the interior.

Now that the resistance has been won, universities across the country are preparing to return, and the College of Commerce is no exception. It has requested instructions from the Ministry of Education to relocate east on a specific date. It is said that the students who will graduate this year will take the graduation examination in mid-April this year, and the school will begin to relocate in May. The school address is approximately near Jiangwan in Shanghai. Alumni in the Shanghai area are very excited about this good news and are now unanimously busy preparing to welcome the returning staff. I think that if this National College of Commerce can be run seriously in Shanghai, one of the world's six largest cities, it will definitely cultivate many outstanding financial talents.

### Incidental Notes from Accompanying Marshal on Inspection (II): The Mysterious Aura of Yan'an Fades in the Torrent of Peace

— Special Dispatch from Our Beiping Office, Dated the 11th: Correspondent Zhang Jianmei

At 2:30 PM on the 4th, Marshal's C40 silver aircraft, along with the green dragonfly-like C40 giants carrying news reporters and team members, hastily bid farewell to  and flew southwest toward a completely different place—Yan'an. Looking out of the square-foot window, the sky was gloomy. The long, wide iron body of the C40 flew close to the dense, plum blossom-like clouds, like a broken plank floating on turbulent ocean waves. I had originally hoped to survey the Ikezhao League desert, where I had wandered last year on this day, from the air, but the boundless, impenetrable cloud layer blocked my view. Oh well! I went to sleep. I don't know how long I slept, but the noisy voices and stomping footsteps in the cabin woke me up. It turned out that we had already reached the airspace above Yan'an. Everyone was excited about this extremely mysterious place. Looking out the window, beneath the aircraft's wings was a range of jagged peaks. At this time, although the aircraft was gradually descending steeply among the mountains, everyone stared, wondering, "How can we land? There are mountains everywhere!" But the clever and steady pilot finally brought us to a palm-sized, small flat nestled among the mountains. When the wheels of the aircraft gently kissed the earth at 4:30, everyone exclaimed in unison, "OK!" This road to Yan'an, like China's road to peace, is: "When mountains and rivers end, one doubts there is no road, but then willow trees and bright flowers reveal another village!"

Peng Dehuai, Despite Illness, Arrives at the Scene

Today, our green dragonfly actually arrived first. Stepping off the plane onto the soft soil after the initial thaw of ice and snow, we busily shook hands with a crowd of people whose identities were indistinguishable from their clothing. Among them was a tall man with a round, brownish face, wearing a dark coffee-colored, rough woolen uniform and a duckbill cap, looking just like a foreman in a city factory. After the handshake, Jin Yanchang from the reception office rushed over to introduce him, and we learned that he was the famous Mr. Mao Zedong. On this day, Zhu De, Peng Dehuai, Lin Zuhan, Mao's wife Jiang Qing (i.e., Lan Ping), Zhu's wife Kang Wuqing, labor hero Wu Manyou, and others all came to the airport to welcome us. General Zhu De was wearing a worn-out, grass-green, coarse woolen military uniform and a gray cotton coat with a black sheepskin collar. In Shanghai, he would definitely be mistaken for a "cook." Although he was over sixty years old, he was still as strong as a bear. Peng Dehuai, despite his illness, arrived at the scene. He appeared older and more gaunt than when I saw him in Luoyang in 1929. Lin Zuhan arrived in Yan'an's only black car, wearing a strangely large navy blue woolen duckbill cap. On the high slopes around the airport, various groups of welcoming crowds supported red banner slogans and waved paper flags. The Yan'an city street self-defense force even carried eye-catching red-tasseled spears to welcome Marshal Marshall, the Allied Chief of Staff who used atomic bombs in warfare. It is said that from noon onwards, over three thousand people from all walks of life in Yan'an formed a welcoming line and successively entered the airport, having waited for four and a half hours.

Jeep Enters Yan River City

In an instant, Marshal's C54 silver aircraft also gracefully landed. Getting off the plane, shaking hands, exchanging pleasantries, and taking photos. At this time, applause thundered throughout the field. Slogans welcoming the three generals, Marshall, Zhang, and Zhou, and "Support the Political Consultative Conference's decision on military reorganization" rose and fell. Marshal Marshall inspected the honor guard and sat in a car. As he passed through the decorated archway with the Chinese and American flags hanging high, the cheers of the crowd completely drowned out the sound of the car. Although many in the crowd were wearing uniforms, even those who weren't were inevitably "ordered to welcome," but seeing those simple faces full of hope and excitement, I still believe that most of them were sincerely cheering for Marshall, the giant of peace. People without political ambitions have no animosity toward "peace" forever.

The American military jeep took us from the airport to the reception office on the hillside outside the south gate of Yan'an. After staying there for a while, our group went out to stroll the streets. Yan'an is a pocket-sized mountain city that leans against the hillside on one side and faces the Yan River on the other. A bombing raid by enemy aircraft in 1927 reduced the entire city to ruins. Eight years later, the city of Yan'an is still a scene of dilapidated houses and crumbling walls. Only a cold and desolate dirt road has been opened up in the middle of the city, with two large locust trees remaining beside it. Otherwise, there is nothing. All the agencies, audit offices, and schools have completely moved out of the city to the hillside or to the cave dwellings opened in the cliffs of the valley. In recent years, the center of military and political affairs has almost entirely concentrated outside the city. Mao Zedong lives in the Qiu Garden, which is extremely far away, and rarely comes out. The CCP Central Committee Office is located in Yangjialing, across the Yan River north of the city. Zhu De lives in Wangjiaping, which is closest to the city. Marshal Marshall and General Zhang Zhizhong are staying at his deputy's headquarters. Among the more important agencies south of the city, only the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government remains. Most of the area south of the city is a commercial district. The streets are very narrow, with small shops selling groceries and fabrics on both sides. Xinhua Bookstore and the Border Region Bank are also embedded among these shops. According to the people who greeted us, these shops were originally small stalls. Because business has been quite profitable in recent years, they have built houses and shop fronts one after another, and soon formed a "street." In order to welcome Marshal Marshall and General Zhang Zhizhong, simple Yan'an has been dressed up. Red and green slogans are everywhere on the walls. The slogans welcoming General Zhang Zhizhong are no less frequent than those welcoming Marshal Marshall. In addition, there are slogans supporting Chairman Jiang. Every shop and agency hangs the national flag of the Republic of China. The flags don't look newly made—some are quite tattered, but it is conceivable that they are not usually hung often, because most of the flags are very fluttering and the colors are very bright.

The Yan River is narrow and shallow, neither beautiful nor magnificent. We can't believe that it is the Yan River praised by some young people? "Ah! You don't know, during the summer mountain floods, the Yan River becomes terrifyingly large, destroying many crops and drowning many people and livestock every year," the person who greeted us explained, telling us not to look down on the narrow and shallow river. I stood on the pebble-strewn bank of the Yan River, looking at the ruins of the old city of Yan'an that had been bombed by enemy aircraft, the primitive cave dwellings like beehives on the hillside cliffs, the barren land that only produces coarse grains, the simple people with earthy faces, and those CCP cadres whose intelligence and knowledge are not particularly remarkable. I couldn't help but think of a question: is it really this small city and its cadres that control such a vast area? What is the source of this small city's great power? This should be a serious question worthy of deep thought.

At seven o'clock, we took a large truck, passed through the old city, crossed the Yan River, and arrived at the CCP Central Committee Office in Yangjialing for a banquet hosted by Mr. Mao Zedong. The Central Committee Office is the most beautiful Western-style building in Yan'an. The entire wall is built with stone formed from water. It has a large reception hall that can accommodate a hundred people for dancing and a large auditorium that can accommodate two or three thousand people for meetings. The banquet began at 7:30. Ten tables were set up in the reception hall, with exquisite Chinese-style dishes. Mr. Mao stood up and raised his glass to give a speech: "General Marshall and Generals Zhang and Zhou have worked hard to establish a new China of peace, democracy, unity, and unification. The people of the whole country should be grateful, and the CCP also expresses its gratitude. The Chinese Communist Party is now prepared to dedicate all its efforts to the cause of national construction. Long live Sino-American cooperation! Long live KMT-CCP cooperation! I wish President Truman, Chairman Chiang, General Marshall, General Zhang Zhizhong, General Zhou Enlai, and everyone good health!" Marshall's response was brief, simple, and enthusiastic: "I thank Chairman Mao for his hospitality. Please everyone, raise your glasses to the Chinese people!"

The Yan'an community's welcome party began in the Central Auditorium at 9 PM. Last year on this day, the CCP National Congress was held here. To this day, there is still a striking line of red characters on the front of the auditorium: "Advance victoriously under the banner of Mao Zedong." General Zhu De's welcome speech on this day was optimistic from beginning to end, with only a thought-provoking section in the middle. That section was: "It is undeniable that there are still many obstacles and difficulties in the cause of peace, democracy, and unity in China. These obstacles and difficulties have prevented the armistice agreement from being implemented in some places to this day. The difficulties encountered by the Political Consultative Conference resolutions are even greater, so it is expected that the implementation of the military reorganization plan will certainly not be smooth sailing." In his elegant and sincere speech, Marshall also dropped a bomb, which was: "In the negotiations between the senior officials of the government and the CCP in Chongqing, I did not feel any difficulties at all. Now the difficulty lies with those young people who are responsible for the reception. They are high-spirited, and although such a reaction is normal, it should soon become a thing of the past." These words were the acute pain Marshall felt during this trip of over ten thousand li. Minister Zhang Zhizhong's speech was sincere and beautiful. He guaranteed that the government would implement the three agreements one hundred percent, and requested that China have twenty or thirty years of peaceful construction. Finally, he said, "I would also like to tell a joke. I just talked to Chairman Mao and Madame Mao, and in the future, when your Communist Party writes history, please don't forget that Zhang Zhizhong came to Yan'an three times!" His speech, which was both solemn and humorous, stirred up three rounds of applause from the audience. After Zhang's speech, the entertainment program began. Unexpectedly, Mr. Mao Zedong did not deliver a speech. He sat silently in the front row, to Marshall's right. Thus, the few words of blessing that Mao gave at the pre-dinner banquet became the only public statement we heard from Mao during our eighteen hours in Yan'an (including sleeping time).

Mao Zedong Arrives Latest

The next day, Marshal Marshall left Yan'an. Among the Yan'an Party, government, and military leaders who saw him off, Mao Zedong arrived the latest. He looked plump, but his spirit and complexion were not very good. It was probably true that he was just recovering from a long illness. In a hurry, a reporter asked Mao when he would go to Chongqing. "Minister Zhang also talked about this matter when he came," Mao said, "Whenever Chairman Chiang wants me to go, I can go." It is said that on the night before and that morning, Mao had talks with Marshall, Zhang Zhizhong, and Zhou Enlai, but they only exchanged their beliefs and understandings of Chinese and international issues and did not specifically discuss any problems. Officials revealed that Mao expressed considerable goodwill during the talks. When Marshal Marshall was about to board the plane, he shook hands with Mao and said, "Our meeting has historical significance." This historic meeting came to an end at 9:30 when the engines of the C54 silver aircraft roared and soared into the clear sky.

Before leaving Yan'an, at the airport, the reporter had a few minutes of conversation with General Zhu De. He reiterated the CCP's firm military reorganization plan. The reporter asked if there were any difficulties in implementing the military reorganization plan. He said, "A proper solution should be found for the surplus officers and soldiers." Lin Zuhan occasionally mentioned that middle and lower-ranking officers inevitably had doubts about the implementation of the military reorganization plan. The reporter asked General Zhu about this, but he did not admit that it was a fact.

Lin Zuhan is a key figure representing the "government" in Yan'an—he is the chairman of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government. The reporter asked him if the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government would be abolished in the future. He said that the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government was approved by the Executive Yuan's meeting. Whether it will be abolished in the future depends on how the government decides in the future.

Peng Dehuai, who is ill (some say it is heart disease), does not seem to appear much in Yan'an. On the 4th, he also participated in the welcome party in the Central Auditorium despite his illness. He silently retreated into the crowd in the third row. There was no stove in the auditorium, and the cold air was bone-chilling. When he coughed, his young and gentle wife, Ms. Pu Anxiu (sister of New Citizen News reporter Pu Xixiu, a student at Fu Jen Catholic University), went to the chair in front and took off his overcoat. Ms. Pu was wearing an old velvet jacket, and was slender and beautiful, like a small bird. She said that she had arrived at the border region in 1938.

Chen Shaoyu Suffers from Both Heart and Stomach Ailments

As soon as we arrived at the reception office, our reporters submitted a list of people we hoped to see. This list included Chen Shaoyu and Wang Shiwei, the author of Wild Lily Flower. Two hours later, we saw Chen Shaoyu in the Central Committee Office. A short, fat man, wearing a gray cotton military uniform, covered with a gray overcoat with a leather collar, and a slightly tattered floral scarf, leaning on a cane, he said that he had been suffering from an enlarged heart and stomach problems in recent years, so he had been recuperating and had not been to Chongqing for five or six years. (In the past, he was the most active CCP figure in the Political Participation Council.) It is said that he has had several children in recent years. The reporter talked to him about Sino-Soviet relations and the Northeast problem. His views were exactly the same as those of the Xinhua Daily editorial, so I won't repeat them.

Xu Teli, with a head of silver hair and a venerable appearance, was pulled aside by Minister Zhang, who once presided over Hunan's affairs, for a conversation before Mao Zedong's dinner. We asked Elder Xu if he planned to return to Hunan. He said, "We'll see what happens."

Marshal Marshall Can't Help But Smile. The entertainment after the banquet on the 4th fully demonstrated how the CCP has abandoned some foreign stereotypes and foreign pastimes in recent years, and has not hesitated to stoop down to learn folk art forms from farmers in order to promote their political education. The "Welcome Marshal Marshall Song" was performed by two pairs of men and women dressed in peasant costumes, wearing waist drums, dancing, singing, and drumming. The lyrics included "The victory of the War of Resistance was achieved, and all parties have contributed," "The Kuomintang and the Communist Party are the two wings of China," "The National Government's Chairman Chiang is supported by the people of the whole country," "Marshal Marshall's prestige will be passed down for thousands of years, and his beautiful name will be marked forever in the history of peace." Hearing this, people couldn't help but smile. Marshall also applauded and laughed loudly after listening. There was also the "Brother and Sister Reclaiming Wasteland" Yangge, which encouraged increased production. It is said to be the most successful Yangge in the border region. Although we felt it was simple and crude (Ye Jianying probably didn't feel interested either, and was snoring loudly under the stage while the Yangge was being performed), this political education work, which reuses old forms, has indeed linked the backward countryside with the Communist Party.

### Reader Opinions: Shanghai Milk Industry Responds to School Milk Movement

Mr. Editor:

Your newspaper published Mr. Ni Zhangqi's essay, "A Most Important but Neglected Group," in the "Special Commentary" section last month. The commentary deeply considers the serious issue of nutrition, believing that current scholarships, grants, and free quotas held by society and school authorities are of significant help to this group of disadvantaged students in continuing their studies. However, if this group of disadvantaged students, despite receiving assistance from various sectors of society to continue their education, suffer from poor daily nutrition, leading to physical weakness and even premature death, then the work of society in this area would be in vain. Who can guarantee that among them are not future Einsteins, Sun Yat-sens, Pasteurs, or Darwins, and other great geniuses? Their premature death due to malnutrition is an incomparable loss to our nation and to all of humanity. The importance of the problem of malnutrition among the disadvantaged is truly as stated in the article: "It is like building a house on sand, without a solid foundation. Once a storm hits, even if they persevere, their own fighting spirit and the efforts, love, and hope of all sectors of society for them will all vanish like bubbles." It is accurate and heartbreaking, and who would not be moved by it?

A few days later, in a casual gathering of colleagues, several mentioned reading this article, expressing deep sympathy. Regarding the statement, "In the early days of the war, materials were cheap, and one yuan could buy dozens of eggs or several bottles of milk. Yet, even then, the diet of disadvantaged students lacked nourishing items," given the current soaring prices, they felt even more regretful.

Our association is a union of those engaged in the milk industry. At the same time, the nature of our business is deeply related to the health and nutrition of the nation. In the work of nation-building after the victory of the war, how we should leverage the characteristics of our business to shoulder important responsibilities is something that every business and every citizen should be aware of. Therefore, we have not forgotten the feelings of regret and unease evoked by reading the article, which made us more aware of the seriousness of the national health problem after the current cruel war, and also increased the responsibility that the milk industry should have towards society.

The impact of this article on our colleagues does not stop at sympathy, regret, and unease. In formal meetings and private conversations among colleagues, we have discussed several times how the Milk Industry Association should respond to this important article. Regrettably, we have not yet discussed a concrete plan. Amidst this reflection, we were pleased to read Mr. Chen Wanli's "Reader Opinion" in your newspaper on February 10, titled "Utilizing Surplus Milk." Mr. Chen, from the standpoint of a doctor, in addition to sympathizing with the plight described in the article, actively proposed concrete methods for implementation to society and the Milk Industry Association. Among the methods proposed by Dr. Chen, the most important is that society should follow the method of raising funds for scholarships and grants, donating a sum of money to be managed by a committee composed of enthusiastic individuals. At the same time, milk producers should set a price that only covers costs to provide milk free of charge to a portion of children in society who have been found to be malnourished by doctors and others who need milk. It should start with children from disadvantaged families, and local health and education authorities should establish institutions to be responsible for sending doctors to examine elementary school children as a basis for receiving free milk. Furthermore, the hygiene of the milk should be strictly managed to meet standards, and radio and film should be used to launch this health campaign.

After reading Mr. Chen Wanli's article and the methods listed therein, we truly feel a sense of mutual understanding. Assuming that the widespread nutritional problems of disadvantaged students are valued by society and relevant municipal authorities, and that Mr. Chen's proposed methods are practical and feasible, all members of the milk industry will unhesitatingly contribute their most sincere cooperation to this important movement related to national health.

Fresh milk is recognized worldwide as the most ideal nutritional beverage for humans. This is true in peacetime, and even more so during wartime. According to 1944 statistics in the United States, there were a total of 27 million dairy cows, producing 122,057 million pounds of milk per day, with each person drinking about one pound of milk per day. In wartime Britain, milk was even more crucial for maintaining national health. Before the war, the average daily intake per person was half a pound, with children exceeding this amount. Almost all schools across the country joined the "Milk in Schools" Scheme. In this program, each child was required to receive milk at noon every day, paying one-third of the value, with the rest subsidized by the government. If the child's parents could not afford this, it would be paid from public funds. During the war, the government stipulated that every mother and child under the age of five could obtain one pound of fresh, pasteurized milk at half price, and it could be provided free of charge in special circumstances. Milk was listed as an important wartime food by the state, and the milk industry was strictly managed and protected by the government because of its close relationship with the development of children and the health of adults in the country.

The average daily milk consumption in Britain and the United States is around one pound per person, while in Shanghai, with a population of four to five million, only 30,000 pounds of milk are produced daily, meaning that only one pound of milk is available for every hundred people. Despite this, there is still a slight surplus of milk (this situation has only recently begun, and it is not very significant). In addition to Mr. Chen's point about people believing in the advertisements for tonics on the radio, there are many other factors worth discussing. Because the relevant aspects are numerous and complex, we hope to have the opportunity to discuss the future and crises of the milk industry with society in Chinese.

The intention of this letter is to express our enthusiastic support and response to the articles by Mr. Ni and Mr. Chen, and at the same time, to convey our attitude to society. Whether this paper-based call can be transformed into practical action, and whether it can become a reality that helps the nutritional problems of disadvantaged students, depends on whether the public and relevant authorities value this issue and are willing to advocate for it. Our association will "wait patiently for orders." We would also like to take this opportunity to report to society that our association recently intends to pilot the "Milk in Schools" movement. We believe that health is the foundation of nation-building, and that the work of national health movement is the foundation of any work. There are of course many methods for national health movement, and milk should be one of the important methods to achieve this goal. With this understanding, and in our own capacity, we should bravely take on this responsibility and work, and we earnestly hope that enlightened people in society and the municipal health and education authorities will give us valuable guidance and assistance. (Letter from the Shanghai Milk Industry Association, March 10)

### The Death of Zhang Xinfu

— Our newspaper's Changchun airmail dispatch on the 8th. New Reporter.

The news of Zhang Xinfu, a member of the Fushun Coal Mine Acceptance Committee, being killed in Fushun, has already appeared in this newspaper, but the details were not clear. Now, Luo Dayu, a standing commissioner of Liaoning Province, Lu Wenyu, a party affairs commissioner of Jilin Province, and Wang Anwen, a party affairs commissioner of Changchun City, have prepared a detailed report on the whole story of Zhang's martyrdom. From this, it can be known that Zhang's murder was a planned conspiracy, and that the Fushun Coal Mine had already been taken over by the Soviet side before Zhang arrived in Fushun, making it clear that the Soviet Union refused to accept the handover from our government. The Eighth Route Army in Fushun was just a puppet controlled by them.

Zhang Xinfu, a member of the Fushun Coal Mine Acceptance Committee, set off from Changchun on January 7 with six attendants in a special train on the China Chang Railway. The Soviet side was accompanied by Major General Marie, the deputy director of the China Chang Railway. Marie's attitude was mild, saying that the Fushun Coal Mine belonged to China and would be successfully taken over. However, after the train arrived in Shenyang, Marie suddenly did not mention the acceptance matter, and said that the Fushun area was very dangerous and that he had to contact them first to prevent Zhang from going. On the 10th, Zhang Chouzhen, chairman of the Northeast Executive Committee, called Zhang, urging him to go to the acceptance, and said that Major General Marie had arrived in Fushun and had told him that everything was ready. Zhang was afraid of the Eighth Route Army and did not dare to go. On the 14th, Zhang received

Major General Marie

Notice, saying that the police sent officers and soldiers to prepare a special train to escort him to Fushun, guaranteeing safety, and the departure time was 1:30 noon. Zhang then led his attendants Xu Yuji, Liu Yuanchun, Niu Junzhang, Zhang Lide, Cheng, etc., five people, to the station on time. Major General Marie personally summoned Li Yuanmin, the second battalion commander of the Railway Guard Public Security Team, to the station and ordered him to send personnel to escort and protect. Therefore, the Railway Police Guard Public Security Team sent Zhang Gongmou, the deputy battalion commander of the second battalion, Shu Shiqing, the captain of the company, Bai Yonggang, a first-class police officer, and six railway policemen to Fushun. Zhang met with Major General Marie again at the station. Marie said that the development was rapid and that he had contacted the commander of the Soviet army stationed in Fushun and sent twenty Soviet soldiers to protect him. Zhang then returned to his special train to Fushun. Because the soldiers sent by Marie did not arrive for a long time, he sent someone to urge them, but they said that this team of soldiers might not come. Suddenly, two Soviet soldiers came to the train, saying that Major General Marie said that there were twenty Soviet soldiers waiting at the Fushun station and there was no need to worry. The road may not be peaceful, so do not stop the train and please start the train. When the train started, there were 25 people on the train, including Zhang and his attendants (15 people), and the driver and fireman (10 people), at 2:15 noon.

When the train traveled to Shenjingzi, forty miles east of Shenyang (this place is occupied by the Eighth Route Army), someone at the station waved a red flag to order the train to stop. Zhang remembered Major General Marie's words and ordered the train not to stop. The station immediately opened fire. Zhang ordered the train to speed up and not to fight back. The sound of gunfire from both sides became denser. Zhang and others lay down on the train. Fortunately, no one was injured. The train was shot at about 158 times. When the train was approaching the Daguantun station near Fushun, it was again ordered to stop by waving a flag, but it still did not stop.

The train stopped at the Fushun station.

There were no Soviet troops

Zhang ordered people to look for them, but there were 20 Soviet soldiers at Daguantun, so he notified them by telephone to come. The commander of the garrison in the Fushun area and the deputy director of the Fushun Public Security Bureau, Feng Ren, arrived (i.e., the Eighth Route Army). The deputy director wanted to step forward to arrest Zhang and others, but was stopped by the Soviet commander, who ordered Zhang and others to enter the car and drive to the Fushun Coal Mine Office.

After arriving, the Soviet commander suddenly said that he did not know about the takeover. Zhang explained, "I was sent by Zhang Jiajing, the director of the Economic Committee of the Northeast Executive Headquarters, and I have already talked to Major General Marie, and Major General Marie has also contacted your army." He asked the Soviet commander, "Since you say you don't know about the takeover of the coal mine, why did you send someone to the station to pick us up?" The Soviet commander replied, "Because I heard that there were two Soviet officers coming to Fushun on this train, so I went to pick them up. I have not heard that you are coming here. We don't know about the takeover of the coal mine and cannot talk about it now." Then Zhang and others were sent to the residence of the deputy director of the Fushun Coal Mine.

On the 15th, two Soviet officers led Sun, the director of the Public Security Bureau, and the armed Public Security Team to enter and talk to the Zhang Committee in the living room downstairs. Sun said, "This is a liberated area. Without the order of our commander, no one is allowed to enter. You brought seven soldiers, which violated our laws and should be punished."

Method of punishment

: First, disarm the seven armed soldiers. Second, please withdraw from Fushun immediately. Zhang said that he came to take over the coal mine on the order of Zhang Jiajing, director of the Economic Committee of the Northeast Executive Headquarters, and the armed soldiers were also sent by Marie to escort him. Sun said, "Our commander is Governor Zhang Xuesi, and Zhang Jiajing cannot control him. We don't care about your takeover of the coal mine, we only punish you for bringing tigers into the liberated area." Zhang immediately refused. Seeing the tense situation, Niu Junzhang and others asked Zhang to express reconciliation to Sun and others, and agreed to hand over the guns tomorrow. Later, Zhang and Niu Junzhang went to the Fushun Soviet Military Command to ask for protection, and asked to speak to Marie, telling him that they were in a dangerous situation and asking him to find a way. Marie promised to arrive in Fushun early tomorrow morning.

On the afternoon of the same day, Zhang called the attendants who stayed in Shenyang from Fushun and told them: "Because I did not obtain the formal permission (referring to a written document) from the Soviet Military Command in Shenyang when I set off from the station, the Fushun Soviet army can only protect their lives until the time of the call. Although I requested to extend it for 24 hours so that I could ask for instructions from my superiors, I was never granted permission." The attendants staying in Shenyang contacted the mayor of Shenyang to negotiate with the Soviet army to rescue them. The Soviet army's attitude was ambiguous, and the negotiations made no progress.

On the morning of the 16th, several members of the Public Security Team suddenly entered with machine guns and detained everyone in a room, saying they wanted to disarm them. The house was already surrounded by armed forces. Under this situation, they had to unload the guns and bullets and hand them over to the Public Security Team. After disarming, they went to various places to check. At this moment, Zhang returned from the outside and said when he saw them checking, "Okay, do as you please!" The Public Security Team found

a bag of documents

In the bag, Zhang stepped forward, pulled out a family letter from it and tore it to pieces. The Public Security Team was furious and scolded. After persuasion, they calmed down.

After the Public Security Team left, the crowd negotiated with Zhang on what to do. Zhang only said, "It's over, Marie didn't come. I went everywhere to find him, but no one would see me. I couldn't find Marie when I called Shenyang." He looked very anxious.

At four o'clock in the afternoon, the commander of the Fushun Soviet army suddenly led Soviet soldiers and several members of the Public Security Team to say, "I'll send you back to Shenyang." Zhang and others immediately asked, "It's getting late, will there be any inconvenience on the road?" The Soviet commander replied, "It doesn't matter." Zhang asked him to be responsible. The Soviet commander laughed and said, "Why bother? You are all Chinese, so what does it matter?" Zhang's nerves had been greatly stimulated and his hands were trembling. When he was about to go out, the Soviet commander suddenly said, "Only technicians are allowed to leave. The seven armed men are not allowed to leave." Because Bai Yonggang, a first-class police officer, was not among the armed soldiers and was specially invited by Zhang, Zhang asked the Soviet commander, "Bai is not an ordinary soldier, but a special person and should be treated the same as the acceptance personnel." He pulled Bai out, but was pulled back by the Soviet commander. Zhang then said, "If the Soviet army does not let you return to Shenyang tomorrow, I will come to Fushun to pick you up the day after tomorrow." Then they took four cars to the station.

On the Shenyang side, on the evening of the 16th, they inquired with the Fushun station by telephone, and the answer was that Zhang and others had taken a Soviet military train back to Shenyang at around 8:30 in the afternoon. He personally witnessed the departure of the train that Zhang and others were on.

On the 30th, the report from the people's self-defense groups and residents of Fushun said that Zhang

Arrived in Fushun the next day

Wang Xinshan, under the protection of the Fushun Public Security Bureau, had taken over the coal mine. Wang Xinshan was the deputy director of the Fushun Coal Mine, and the director was Russian. Because the news of the central government's takeover had been announced in the newspapers long ago, the general public believed that Wang Xinshan was the acceptance committee appointed by the central government.

On the 25th, the Shenyang City Police Department received a report that Zhang and the other eight people were transported by the Fushun Soviet army to a location 20 miles outside the city by military train on the evening of the 16th and stabbed to death with bayonets!

On the 26th, Rong Haizhan, the representative of the Fushun People's Self-Defense Group, reported the process as follows:

At about 8:20 p.m. on February 16, the Soviet army used a military train to carry Zhang and his attendants Xu Yugu, Liu Yuanchun, Cheng, the translator Zhang Lide, and Zhang Gongmou, the deputy battalion commander of the railway police guard public security team, Shu Shiqing, the company commander, etc., and many Soviet military officers and soldiers and members of the Fushun Public Security Bureau, and departed for Shenyang. At about 9:00 p.m., they arrived at the Lishizhai station, the fifth station west of Fushun. The Soviet army forced them to get off the train, stripped off Zhang's clothes, and took them to the mass grave on the south mountain of the station and stabbed them to death. At that time, Zhang said with grief and indignation: "I escaped into the mainland after the September 18th Incident. I never thought that I would end up like this when I returned to my hometown. I am willing to accept this fate for the country and the nation!" Zhang Gongmou, the deputy battalion commander, fought naked with the Public Security Team and snatched a gun, but was stabbed to the ground. His body was found to have 16 stab wounds. At that time, nearby residents heard the cries,

Terrible to hear

Bai Yonggang and the six railway policemen who were left in the residence of the deputy director of the Fushun Coal Mine thought they were doomed to die. A Soviet soldier who had been guarding outside for the past two days suddenly came and said, "They are going to kill you now, run away! They have already killed them." Bai did not fully believe it and did not leave, but he was even more frightened. At 11:00 p.m., the director of the Public Security Bureau suddenly led several teams with their guns pointed at Bai and others, and escorted them to the Public Security Bureau, where they were guarded by the Public Security Team. Until midnight, the deputy director and seven or eight members of the Public Security Team came in again, apologized to Bai and others, and asked about the residence of the deputy director of the Fushun Coal Mine.

On the 17th, a man surnamed Zhang, who was in his forties and was guarding Bai and others, said to Bai and others, "Your dangerous period is over, and there is no danger to your lives now. Later, you may be sent back to Shenyang, sent to the mine, or join the training of the Eighth Route Army."

On the 18th, the sky cleared up, and two Soviet soldiers came and said to Bai and others, "I'll send you to the station." Bai and others did not know whether this trip would be good or bad, and their faces changed. The Soviet soldiers smiled and said, "Are you afraid? Were two of your policemen killed?" When Bai and others heard this, they were even more terrified, thinking that Zhang and others might have been killed. The Soviet soldiers sent Bai and others to Shenyang. After arriving at the Soviet army command in Daguantun, two Soviet officers interrogated Bai and others to see if they were members of the Kuomintang and showed them an official document sent by the Fushun Soviet army, which read: "Fifteen Kuomintang members came to Fushun to disturb the mine. Eight have been killed and seven have been captured." Bai and others defended that they were railway policemen and were sent to Fushun by Marie to guard the mine. They were finally sent to the Shenyang City Police Department and released.

### A Variety of Scenes Inside and Outside the Second Plenary Session

— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper in Chongqing, Zhao Haosheng

The plenary session venue is in the Army Hall, the main entrance faces the mighty Yangtze River. In the center of the Dragon Gate square, a large flagpole stands tall, with the Kuomintang flag fluttering atop, welcoming the wind. The square is adorned with evergreen trees, lush and lovely, adding to the majestic atmosphere in front of the gate.

Double rows of guards stand on either side of the gate, with police officers in white sleeves scattered among them, amidst a constant stream of cars of all colors driving in.

Cars with a green plum blossom pattern permit can drive straight into the main gate. Inside, a larger rectangular square reveals that the original two rows of car garages are no longer sufficient. All have been moved and arranged in three long rows, with fifteen vehicles in each row, creating a "sea of cars" with nearly a hundred colorful vehicles. The back door is the second parking lot, where cars of all colors are arranged in a vast expanse.

The main entrance of the venue has more than ten steps, and on the balcony above the door stand four small flagpoles, with Kuomintang flags waving in the wind.

In front of the gate, a red banner several feet long reads in bold characters: "Second Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang."

On either side of the highest step, two wooden signs are erected, stating: "Attendants, stop here."

On both sides of the venue's main entrance stands another solemn guard.

Outside the glass door corridor, a row of long tables is arranged. In the center is the signature table for the Executive Committee members, on the right is the signature table for the Supervisory Committee members, and on the left is the signature table for the press release group and conference staff. The tables are filled with conference printed materials. Every morning, the "Central Daily News" and "Peace Daily News" are available, and at noon, the Nanjing "Central Daily News" is delivered by air, available for attendees to read freely.

On the wall between the two doors hangs a seating chart for all committee members and attendees, along with the badges for Central Committee members, pink staff passes, white security personnel passes, yellow worker symbols, and car passes.

Pushing aside the green door curtain, a magnificent hall decorated with red, white, and blue colors appears before one's eyes, resembling a garden.

Fourteen square pillars, seven on each side, stand inside the hall. Each pillar is completely wrapped in red, white, and blue cloth, and a shield made of the national flag with five small Kuomintang flags inserted is nailed to each pillar.

A red banner with white characters displaying the full name of the conference hangs in front of the rostrum. At the center of the platform is a large national flag and a portrait of Sun Yat-sen, with twenty-six small Kuomintang flags inserted in flag stands on either side. The tips of the steel spears sparkle. At the front of the platform, facing the audience, is a row of seats for the chairman and secretariat staff, with Western-style leather-backed chairs and desks piled high with documents and stationery. A row of camellias stands by the stage, and a row of wintersweet flowers below the stage, opening the purple curtains. The scenery is like a pile of brocade, colorful and dazzling under the mercury lights.

Below the platform, facing the audience, is the podium. There are 327 committee seats in the hall, with Supervisory Committee members on the left and Executive Committee members on the right. The chairs have wide armrests for writing, with blotting paper attached to the front and pencils attached to the back for immediate use.

The first seat for the Executive Committee members is written "President Chiang," and the last seat (No. 285) is "Zhang Jingyu." The first seat for the Police Committee members is written "Wu Jingheng," and the last seat (No. 142) is written "Liu Chengxu."

The current regiment commander and the heads of various ministries and commissions, the first row on the left is Chen Chuncai, Zhou Junyan, the center is Chiang Ching-kuo, the first row on the right is Zhang Huanlong, Yuan Ruchuan. Conference staff and the press release group sit around the long chairs against the wall.

The podium, secretariat seats in the conference hall, and the podium are equipped with broadcasting equipment. Large loudspeakers are installed in the corners of the conference hall, with sufficient power to broadcast even the coughs of the elderly Wu Zhihui.

The blue curtains on the surrounding glass windows are always tightly drawn, and guards are stationed around the windows, with strict arrangements.

The lights on the roof and corners are bright, and the carpet underfoot is as soft as ever. The camellias on the platform bloom in the sunny weather, and the hall is filled with more warm spring.

Large red and white banners with the slogans "Improve Party Affairs" and "Reform Politics" are hung inside the hall, striking and eye-catching.

The rest room for the conference presidium is in the Chief’s office, and the rest room for the Central Committee members is in the newly built three-story building on the right side of the conference hall. During breaks, snacks are provided, the buns are very large, and the biscuits are extremely abundant.

Since the 11th, all conference entry and exit permits have been changed. The staff's pink slips have been changed to light green, and the security personnel's white slips have been changed to purple. On each attendant's slip, the name of the committee member they are accompanying is clearly written, such as: "Chen Bulei Committee Member Attendant ×××". Whether the committee members are sitting in the rest room chatting or standing on the steps in front of the hall basking in the sun, they all hear the sound and enter the conference hall, resembling the "class starts" situation in a school.

When the meeting adjourns, the cars in the parking lot swirl around, and the sound of horns becomes a cacophony. Outside the main gate, on the side of the road, crowded citizens stand and watch the long snake of cars. (March 10)

Spring and Autumn

### Molière and Shakespeare: A Comedic Comparison

— Yang Tongfang

From the late 16th century to the first half of the 18th century, the theatrical form of "comedy" underwent significant development, occupying a critical place in the artistic realm of the time. This was due to the influence of the Italian Renaissance, which revived the comedies of ancient Greece and Rome in the minds of the writers of the time.

Molière and Shakespeare are the foremost representatives of comedic writers from that period. And their works displayed two opposing tendencies. Everyone knows that Molière achieved the highest acclaim in French comedy. His plays hold a permanent place in French literature. Shakespeare is an eternally revered playwright, practically known to every man, woman, and child. Molière's consistent style was to represent the realities of society, fully expressing the spirit and color of classicism. The material for his comedies was derived entirely from the actual social conditions of his time. In the depiction of characters, he comparatively neglected unique personalities, focusing instead on more general types. This is precisely the opposite of Shakespeare, who valued the effect of the story more than the effect of the character. Therefore, Shakespeare highly valued individual character portrayal, while Molière focused on the presentation of typical characters.

The characters in Molière's comedies are all figures from the realities of the society of his time, and his works reflected the overall social life of that era. Some say that the social history of the 17th and 18th centuries can be read from his works. He brought the "social function of comedy" to full expression. What he showed people in his works was mutual opposition and inevitable conflict. Although he exposed the dark side of the society of his time with his sharp pen, he actually explained the relationship between people and society, and the relationship between people and each other. He hoped that his audience would gain a clear understanding of society from watching his plays, and that this would arouse the idea of transforming society. Unlike Shakespeare, who loved to use beautiful endings, matching the effect of music to entertain the audience, he only wanted to evoke a laugh containing ideological components in the audience.

Thus, it is worth examining his own explanation of comedy: "To depict all ridiculous figures on the stage should not make anyone feel uneasy. Those figures are public mirrors, in which we should not pretend not to see ourselves." "Indeed,

to express great thoughts, to accuse fate, to question the deities, are all much easier than to reveal ridicule in an appropriate way, or to make human errors appear pleasant on the stage. When you portray those heroes, you can do whatever you want, as they are all imaginary figures, and we do not require any similarity on them." From these words, we can easily see his thoughts.

In Molière's plays, we rarely find ardent passion and abundant imagination, which is completely different from Shakespeare. Molière often uses reason more than emotion when dealing with plot, sometimes even abandoning emotion and only making general practical sense explanations. Reality, objectivity, calmness, and composure are the characteristics of his works. He produces his works by appealing to his reason and moderation, so extremes and exaggerations are rare. Unlike Shakespeare's comedies, which are woven from passion, he presents human weaknesses and mistakes through the expression of typical characters, intellectually. Naturally, only individual antagonistic views can be found here, and no intense and active scenes can be seen.

Each of Molière's comedies is a representation of general social reality. In the character portrayal, he especially emphasizes general social truths, never paying as much attention to the creation of unique characters as Shakespeare. He gives people social types, with no individuality at all. In Shakespeare's comedies, resistance from the individual against society expresses sympathy for the individual. He handled the characters standing in a position of being oppressed by society, and his goal was to awaken people to reform the unreasonable society. Although Molière's works express conflict between individuals and society, he absolutely does not sympathize with those individuals who resist society. He does not agree that people should transform established social forces, and people should accommodate society. For example, in his play "The Misanthrope," Alceste became ridiculous because he presumptuously wanted to transform society. He felt that the society at that time was too hypocritical, and added a very heavy attack. In Molière's view, Alceste was really ridiculous, because society was not wrong after all, and there was no room for criticism. Instead, Alceste himself was wrong.

Generally speaking, Molière's comedies have immortal artistic value. It can be said to be philosophical rather than literary. As far as the "appeal to reason" is concerned, he and Roman comedies based on situations or tricks, and the satirical or realistic comedies represented by Jonson in England belong to the same category, while Shakespeare's "appeal to emotion" comedies and the sentimental comedies of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries are clearly another category.

### Must Write Purely

— Wei Cong

Recently, many writers have advocated that articles should be written purely. Ai Wu, Zhan Yi, Duanmu Hongliang, Lu Fen and others have expressed their opinions on the formal expression of articles, and their conclusions are consistent: excellent articles must be records of excellent spoken language.

Since the May Fourth Movement, vernacular Chinese has been popular in society for nearly thirty years. No one can deny the success of vernacular Chinese and its contribution to our country's culture and education. Whether from the point of view of popularizing education or promoting culture, vernacular Chinese does have its indelible value.

However, has colloquial language been successful in the literary revolution? No, we cannot say that it has been completely successful, only that it has been partially successful. As the late writer Zhang Tianyi said: "Until spoken language can fully approach pure spoken language, it cannot be considered completely successful." As the name implies, colloquial language must refer to articles written using the expressive methods of spoken language, and the unification of language and writing is a common trend in countries around the world. Language is for expressing thoughts, and articles are also for expressing thoughts. They each have their own uses, but the purpose is the same.

Many articles are written in a style that is neither classical nor vernacular, and the mixture is very awkward. The reaction given to readers is uncoordinated and unclean, and reading them is often unpleasant. Zhu Ziqing once strongly advocated in an article on writing methods: don't write colloquial language, otherwise you must write like spoken language, and words and characters that are not easy to say should be discarded from the article. Liu Bannong also pointed out a major path for writing: you must train your spoken language well in order to write good articles.

Here, I would like to quote a passage from Ye Shengtao: "Those who have received very shallow classical Chinese education, or have simply never received classical Chinese education, are fortunate people. They don't have to spend much thought or effort to free themselves from the old shackles. What is worrying is that they pick up a pair of old shackles and put them on their hands and feet—they also add a little classical Chinese words and phrases to the colloquial language." Ye's words are very insightful, and he strongly advocates that authors should grasp the principle of "writing purely." Yes, it is really a bit unreasonable for colloquial language to ask classical Chinese for rescuers again.

Most people who write articles now have received a very deep classical Chinese education. When they write colloquial language, they will unintentionally insert some classical Chinese set phrases, so sometimes it is impossible to completely avoid using a little classical Chinese words and phrases. Even those writers who advocate that articles should be written purely, their essays and novels, even if they exhaust their efforts, still cannot avoid using classical Chinese words and phrases, and still cannot avoid destroying the purity of colloquial language. Zhu Ziqing and Ye Shengtao are considered relatively successful. The articles they write are already close to spoken language, although it cannot be said that they are completely close. Pure colloquial language is really not easy to write. You must go through some training in writing skills in order to write fluently, cleanly, concisely, and vividly.

Some people say that if the article is written close to spoken language, isn't that "vulgar and detrimental to elegance"? This is an extremely incorrect traditional view. You must know that a good article must have rich emotions or unique thoughts. How can it be said to be "elegant" by simply using a few classical Chinese words and phrases that you think are very elegant in form to render it? Thought is a reflection of real life, and language and articles are both indispensable tools for expressing thought. Being able to express true thought, even if you write the most vulgar language, will not lose its value. The ancients even knew to say: "The greatest feelings are without embellishment." It can be seen that the most moving articles do not come from the deliberation of stale phrases or the embellishment of flowery words.

Many people say that Zhu Ziqing's "Back View" is a good article, and the author himself admits that that short essay is a relatively satisfactory one among his works. That article was published more than twenty years ago, but people have always loved to read it, and almost every junior high school Chinese textbook includes it. The reason why "Back View" is loved is really because the author has rich emotions and personal experience. It is not a hard-written article of pointless groaning. In addition, he can express his feelings with pure spoken language techniques, so even without so-called elegant words or beautiful words, simple spoken language can still touch people's hearts. An article like this can be understood even by middle school students or even elementary school students, but college students may not be able to write it, and they may not even be able to fully appreciate its benefits, right?

"Half a Cart of Wheat Straw," a short story that was widely circulated during the Anti-Japanese War, was written in the most popular spoken language. The reason why it was highly praised was because it had content and could use pure spoken language to express living people and a living society. Lao She's novels are also praised by many people. Some people say that his success lies in his ability to use pure spoken language to portray his typical characters.

Galsworthy said: "The secret of writing is very simple. Beginners should listen to plays more, pay attention to the lines of the performance, and carefully read the dialogues of the script, which can help with writing." We want our articles, whether it is a short essay of hundreds of words or a novel of millions of words, we have to ask ourselves: is this pure spoken language? In addition, we must live well, have a fulfilling life (to live a meaningful life in the social group, and to review and improve our lives at any time and any place. Developing correct and progressive ideas can all help with writing. As for how to enrich our vocabulary so that our language and articles can be expressed more perfectly and more fully, that is especially not to be ignored.

### Qinyuan Chun

— Xu Junwu

Written with a Group Photo of Lu Mang

Eight years in Chongqing, drunk together in the east wind, writing epics together. Thinking of the sight of the land, swept away the fishy dust, enjoying the pleasantries, a grand gathering to pursue. Roosters crowed in the wind and rain, laughing at you and me, the articles written to serve the country are only a few. In our leisure, let’s say that in the south of the Yangtze River and the north of the Great Wall, we will again embrace the beauty. The reunion on the sea is truly strange! Who believes that it is the time to purify the sky? Let’s collect our sorrows, join shoulders, arrange the future, and express our feelings. Earthly fame and fortune, talent like precious pearls, traces of a spring dream may exist. Wielding the pen, watching the heroic posture, living up to the expectations.

### Double Flying Couple (20)

— Zhao Qingge

If it is said that Shi Yulou also loved Madam Weng the Second, it would be better to say that Shi Yulou needed Madam Weng the Second appropriately. Fortunately, Madam Weng the Second still had some private jewelry, so she often bought opium and tonics to support Shi Yulou. Therefore, Shi Yulou felt that he could not live without Madam Weng the Second. As for feelings, he himself was very confused. It seemed that all his feelings were expressed in "the play"! He was no longer very aware of the difference between life and the play. Sometimes he even thought that the play was all of his life. He lived for the play, and for the play, he needed Madam Weng the Second. He couldn't explain this emotion clearly, so he had no way to tell Madam Weng the Second about it. Although he understood that Madam Weng the Second's heart was different from his, and he understood that Madam Weng the Second regarded him as all of her life, he did not think so. He secretly laughed at Madam Weng the Second for being a stupid person! Madam Weng the Second was attached to the secondary part of his life.

Why did Shi Yulou become like this? Because he was a mechanized actor. He had no knowledge other than "the play." Although he sang so many words, sentences, poems, and essays, he did not recognize a single word. The words, sentences, poems, and essays he sang were all passed down orally by his teacher. He could only understand these words, sentences, poems, and essays partially and did not know that these words, sentences, poems, and essays came from books. Therefore, he had no way to jump from the play to reality. And it was precisely because of this that he could not feel true happiness; or the genuine joy; nor could he feel true pain; or true worry!

Shi Yulou was still a kind-hearted person. When he realized that Madam Weng the Second had intentions for him, but he had no intentions for Madam Weng the Second, he took the opportunity to open his tightly sealed mouth and said solemnly to Madam Weng the Second:

"You know, I am an actor! A traveling actor! I will leave here at any time, that is, leave you!"

Madam Weng the Second nodded without surprise and said:

"I know! But I don't care at all."

"That's good!" Shi Yulou smiled happily again.

Shi Yulou never thought that Madam Weng the Second would give such a straightforward answer. This was simply not in line with the logic of Shi Yulou's general understanding of Madam Weng the Second! Although he was very happy, he was also a little strange. He couldn't believe that Madam Weng the Second's words came from sincerity. Based on Madam Weng the Second's past behavior, she would not have said these words. Because of these words, he felt that Madam Weng the Second only regarded him as an accessory to the secondary part of her life! So Shi Yulou felt insulted! Perhaps it was a hidden sadness? Shi Yulou regretted having such an unnecessary personal relationship.

Madam Weng the Second looked at Shi Yulou's contemplative and dazed expression and couldn't help but laugh. Naturally, she would not understand Shi Yulou's mood at this time, and she quite misunderstood Shi Yulou. She thought that Shi Yulou was testing her, and even worried about the future—Shi Yulou was reluctant to leave her. Therefore, she was secretly pleased! She felt supreme happiness and pride. She believed that Shi Yulou had been controlled by her and that Shi Yulou was deeply in love with her!

"Hey, you, who makes a living by 'opening your mouth,' why have you closed your golden mouth again?" Madam Weng the Second said jokingly.

Shi Yulou glanced blankly at Madam Weng the Second. He didn't know what Madam Weng the Second's words meant? How should he answer her? Then, from Madam Weng the Second's peaceful and happy expression, he felt a malicious mockery. So, he was simply angry! He thought, "So she is smarter than me. Her heart is the same as all the men and women who support me. I am an actor; she is a theatergoer; I am an object for her to pass the time. If I leave, there will still be other actors who will come to entertain her; so she doesn't 'care.' I am just a toy in her eyes! Yes, the theatergoers are smart, only the actors are stupid!" Thinking of this, Shi Yulou was filled with indignation, his face flushed red, and he resolutely waved his sleeves and wanted to leave.

### Our Group

— Song Mu

He told me some things that happened after we parted. Although we only separated for five or six years, the changes in people evoked a strong sense of vicissitude. We sighed together for a while. I said it felt like listening to a hazy story, or having a long dream. He just replied indifferently, "Because we are all old."

I seemed to be immersed in past memories. A series of images floated in my mind. Back then, we were studying in the mountain city, and our days were filled with vitality and joy. We ran drama clubs, published wall newspapers... We were all naive, simple, and doing what we thought was a sacred cause, without worries or troubles. Who would have thought that the group of people would now be scattered like stars? He mentioned that tall guy with a very pretty face has been doing very poorly in recent years. He joined the army for a while and suffered constantly for pink romances. Now he is still wandering in a remote corner. And that burly northeasterner, I can easily remember him. When I left Annam, he even came to see me. His rough face was covered with bumps. He was easily angered, his eyes wide and round, as if he was about to fight someone. His smile was very ugly. At that time, he had a big falling out with another friend for a girl. After we separated, it is said that he was quite popular for a while. Now he is the deputy manager of an insurance company and has married a wife. He said that this once irritable man has become very docile. He does his job conscientiously. The girl he pursued in the past has also married. Everything seems very happy.

My friend, seeing me lowering my head and feeling depressed, impatiently reminded me:

"Do you remember that Shanghainese with the fair skin? We used to call him 'Little Slicker'?"

"Are you talking about the one who always had his hair slicked back?"

"Yes, that's him. He's setting up a street stall in Kunming now."

I was slightly stunned. I found it hard to believe.

"Wasn't he very capable?"

"Maybe. After leaving school, he initially opened a beef shop, but then I heard his private life was terrible, and he ended up in this situation."

Then, as if he suddenly remembered something, he patted my shoulder:

"Hey, do you want me to tell you something about that big-eyed girl?"

"Are you saying...?"

"Have you forgotten? I'm talking about the one who lived on Jiezishang Street, the place we used to love to go to in the countryside?" He paused, looked at me deeply, and then continued: "She often thought of you later, you know? Regretfully, you didn't even send a letter?"

"What is she doing now?"

"She got married a long time ago and has several children."

I was silent for a while, and my friend added.

"I heard that her current situation is not very good. She's not having a good time."

Perhaps my friend intentionally changed the subject. He asked if I remembered the camellia planted in front of our house. He said that because it wasn't the blooming season, otherwise he would have liked to bring me one or two branches. I smiled gratefully for my friend's kindness.

Hoping to Rent Suitable School Buildings in the Taishan District

To the Editor: We are all working youths with a passion for work and a strong desire to use our spare time to do something beneficial for society and the country. We want to run a free night school in the Taishan District to rescue some adults who have dropped out of school. Because they are the backbone of building a new China, they should have the opportunity to be educated. However, we are very unfamiliar with the education sector. Although there are now teachers who are willing to volunteer, and relatives and friends who are willing to help us financially, and we believe that there will certainly be eager students in the future, there is no place to have classes. Seeing that many school classrooms are empty at night, we only need to borrow them for two hours each day, and we are prepared to pay a reasonable rent, but we have no way to borrow them. We are waiting, hoping that the education authorities who are enthusiastic about education will extend a helping hand to us, lend us classrooms, help us establish this adult free school, and encourage and urge our courage to run it. We have always admired your newspaper's enthusiasm for public welfare, and we dare to ask you to disclose it for our good fortune. (Reader: Cai Ze)

Editor's Note: We greatly admire Mr. Cai and others' enthusiasm for free education. We hope that the school authorities in the Taishan District will provide support. Fortunately, they are willing to pay a reasonable rent. I think among the readers, someone will definitely do what is right for this public service, please send a letter to us.

### Xiaofan Elementary School Robbed

Teachers and Staff Appeal for Relief

Director: Our school was suddenly robbed by bandits at around 7 p.m. on March 9. In addition to robbing 650,000 yuan of school fees, sundry expenses, and meal fees, and cash from each teacher, all of our colleagues' clothes, shoes, socks, and luggage were taken away, worth 5 million yuan. These are all the hard work of the teachers over the years. How can we not be heartbroken when they are robbed? We have no clothes to change, no clothes to change for the warm weather. At a time when prices are soaring, our meager monthly income is difficult to maintain. It is difficult to add shoes and socks, let alone add a dress or pants. Looking forward to the future, how can we live? Suffering this disaster, how can we feel at ease to educate? We have always admired your spirit, and your enthusiasm for good deeds. We sincerely state our difficulties and earnestly ask you to appeal to all circles for relief. The colleagues are extremely grateful. Respectfully, the entire faculty and staff of Shanghai Municipal Xiaofan Elementary School (School address: Jiazhuang, Jinjiaqiao, Pudong)

### Pudong Bank Exchanges Counterfeit Bills

In order to facilitate the exchange of legal tender for counterfeit bill holders, Pudong Bank has specially established a temporary counterfeit bill exchange office at the Zhejiang Industrial Bank at Songxia Street, Zhongzheng East Road, and dispatched personnel to handle the exchange.

### Answering Readers

Zhou Zhaoding of Cixi asked: Several years before the founding of the Republic, my ancestors pawned a house to A, receiving more than one hundred yuan of pawn money, for a term of ten years. More than ten years later, A also pawned it to B, also for a term of ten years. Last year, B's term also expired. I should prepare the money to take back the appraisal from A. According to A, the government issued an order before the war that all pawn contracts that are more than 30 years old cannot be retrieved. Is this command still valid today? Please advise.

Attorney Duanmu replied: Refer to the contents of the pawn contract, the Civil Law, the Real Estate Law, the Banking Law, and the detailed Real Estate Administration Regulations to handle it.

He Hansheng asked: I heard that there is a house owned by our family. During the War of Resistance, it was occupied by the enemy. I have not dared to ask about it for eight years. The contract was also destroyed during the escape. Currently, there are legal problems. Is there a way to register and file it to prevent unscrupulous people from causing trouble or extorting money? This matter is related to the land issue after the War of Resistance, and I hope to discuss it publicly.

Attorney Duanmu Kai replied: If you want to reclaim it, you should provide substantial evidence.

Dong Deshu asked: Before the war, I bought a store in Yangshupu, continuing to rent and operate it. Since the August 13th Shanghai War, I abandoned the store and goods and fled to the interior until the Japanese surrendered and returned to Shanghai. I learned that the former rented shop was taken over by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and set up as an office. I followed the regulations of the National Government for returning real estate and submitted it to the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui regions, and the Enemy and Pseudo-Property Administration Bureau in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui regions to request its return. It has been more than three months and there is still no progress. Please give instructions.

Attorney Duanmu Kai replied: You can submit an urging request to the competent official authority.
