It is said that the content of the talks still concerned the issue of administrative power in the recovered areas. Despite repeated inquiries from reporters, neither side revealed a single word of their opinions.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] (Reference News) According to relevant sources, Marshal Marshall is considering returning to his country to report on his duties and is expected to discuss China policy with President Truman after his return. However, it is rumored that Marshal Marshall will return to China again after his trip. It is also rumored that the soon-to-be-replaced American Ambassador to China, John Leighton Stuart, may be the second person in Marshal Marshall's position.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] The CCP delegation originally planned to host reporters at 4:00 PM today to report on the Central Plains war situation. However, due to insufficient preparation, it has been changed to 4:00 PM tomorrow at the Meiyuan New Village office. At that time, Major General Zheng Shaowen, the CCP representative from the 9th group stationed in Hankou, will attend the report.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] In order to understand the situation of the Central Plains war, Special Envoy Marshall specifically telegraphed Colonel He Zhujian, the American representative of the 9th Executive Group stationed in Hankou under the Military Mediation Department; Major Lu Jishi, the government representative; Major General Zheng Shaowen, the CCP representative; Lieutenant Colonel Bai Luosuo, the American representative of the 32nd Executive Group stationed in Xuanbei Huadian; Lieutenant Colonel Li Guiliu, the government representative; and Ren Shishun, the CCP representative, to come to Nanjing to hear reports from the three parties' representatives before proceeding with mediation. The representatives of the three parties arrived in Nanjing on a special plane chartered by Marshall at 3:25 PM yesterday. He Zhujian and Bai Luosuo have already met with Marshall and reported in detail the movements of Li Xiannian's unit of the CCP's Central Plains Military Region westward along the Pinghan Railway and the clashes with the National Army along the way. It is reported that after listening to the reports from the American representatives, Marshall intends to inquire about the opinions of the government and the CCP on the Central Plains war before deciding on a plan and starting mediation.

[United Press, Nanjing, 10th] Special Envoy Marshall shifted his focus in peace negotiations today to putting out the growing flames of war, recalling the 9th Executive Group from the critical northern Hubei region to hear emergency reports.

### Dr. John Leighton Stuart Appointed Ambassador to China; Truman Officially Announces; Overwhelming Welcome from Our Government and Public

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] US President Truman announced in Washington on the 9th that he had appointed John Leighton Stuart as the US Ambassador to China and that it would not affect Special Envoy Marshall's work in China. After this news reached the capital, Special Envoy Marshall issued a statement this afternoon, expressing his welcome. He stated: "The newly appointed US Ambassador to China, John Leighton Stuart, is a non-official American who has lived in China for the longest time. He not only deeply understands the national conditions of China but is also a good friend to all parties in the Chinese government and public. His appointment as US Ambassador to China is a good assistant to me." Marshall's statement shows that he will continue to stay in China as President Truman's special envoy and work for China's peace and unity.

[United Press, Washington, 9th] President Truman today recommended and appointed John Leighton Stuart, President of Yenching University, as the US Ambassador to China, to fill the vacancy left by former Ambassador Hurley. According to a statement issued by the White House, John Leighton Stuart has known President Chiang Kai-shek and his wife and other government officials for many years. John Leighton Stuart has previously argued that an understanding between the United States and the Soviet Union on their China policy is a prerequisite for resolving many disputes in China.

[Another Telegram] President Truman announced today that John Leighton Stuart's appointment as Ambassador to China will not affect the status of Special Envoy Marshall.

[United Press, Nanjing, 10th] A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced today that the United States has appointed John Leighton Stuart, President of Yenching University, as Ambassador to China without seeking the approval of the Ministry. However, if this appointment is officially confirmed, the Chinese government will certainly welcome it.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Liu Kai welcomed John Leighton Stuart's appointment as US Ambassador to China at a press conference, praising John Leighton Stuart as "a good friend of China."

Dr. Stuart's Talk

[United Press, Beiping, 10th] The newly appointed US Ambassador to China, John Leighton Stuart, made a statement to the United Press reporter here today, saying, "I deeply feel the difficult situation, but I will do my best in any way to assist Special Envoy Marshall in completing his mission of promoting peace. I enthusiastically agree with Marshall's policy." This appointment will give me new experience. It is John Leighton Stuart's first time as a diplomat as a scholar. I knew something about it beforehand, but I only learned about the appointment a few hours ago. Now I have to temporarily ask for leave from Yenching University. Educational work has to be temporarily interrupted, which is a pity. Once the arrangements are in place, I will go to Nanjing to assume my new post in a few days. There is no time to look for a successor as President of Yenching University.

[United Press, Nanjing, 10th] The United States' sudden appointment of educator and missionary John Leighton Stuart is seen as President Truman having found a figure welcomed by all parties in China. Zhou Enlai, a central leader, said, "I personally respect Dr. Stuart very much and warmly welcome his appointment. This appointment will gain the deep trust of all Chinese people."

[United Press, Washington, 10th] The State Department today predicted that the appointment of 70-year-old Presbyterian pastor John Leighton Stuart as Ambassador to China will strengthen Special Envoy Marshall's efforts to unite the Chinese Kuomintang and Communist parties, but it is not overly optimistic about the speed and extent to which Marshall and Stuart will complete their mission.

### The CCP's "July 7th" Declaration is Purely a Propaganda Smoke Screen; Minister Peng Analyzes and Refutes it in Detail

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] A foreign press conference was held at 4:30 PM on the 10th, presided over by Minister Peng Xuepei and Vice Minister Liu Zeng. The main questions and answers are recorded below:

(Question) What is the government's attitude towards the four new proposals put forward by the CCP on the anniversary of the July 7th Incident, and what is the government's attitude towards the CCP's anti-American propaganda?

(Minister Peng's Answer) The CCP's July 7th Declaration is a propaganda smoke screen, not a genuine proposal. It has ulterior motives other than seeking a path to peace. The first two points are not new issues: stopping the conflict, insisting on reorganizing the army, and determining the garrison locations. Reopening the Political Consultative Conference requires the CCP to reiterate the original resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. The remaining two points happen to reveal the mystery of the so-called anti-American movement. This anti-American propaganda is due to the needs of the CCP's domestic political interests and is completely contrary to the wishes of the government and the people. As for the so-called refusal of American aid and denial of American loans, it is not worth discussing seriously.

Current Military Situation (Question) Minister Peng stated on June 30th that if the Communist army attacks the National army, it should be resisted or driven away. Will such actions occur in the future, and what are the cities currently under attack by the Communist army?

(Minister Peng's Answer) The current military situation can be summarized as follows: (A) The Communist army is concentrating heavy troops to besiege Haimen, Liuhe, and other places, and seems to be launching a fierce attack. The government is paying close attention to this matter. (B) The Communist army is fiercely attacking Qingxian, south of Tianjin. (C) The Communist army continues to besiege Datong. (D) Li Xiannian's unit of the Communist army violated the agreement and, from its original garrison in northern Hubei, broke through westward and is now approaching Xiangyang. The following are the detailed situations: Since July 1st, the Communist army has not only not stopped its attacks on western Shandong and the Northeast, but has also continued large-scale attacks on Hubei, Henan, and northern Jiangsu. Within Shandong, Yancheng, outside Dawen, on the Jinpu Railway, was continuously attacked from the 1st to the 3rd. Baisha and Huangbu water source, north of Qingdao, were attacked on the 2nd. Jin Cen Town, Zihe Store, Linzi, Weixian, Qingzhou, and areas near Jimo along the Jiaoji Railway have all been subjected to constant attacks. Now it is also increasing troops near Jingzhou, and there are also 40,000 to 50,000 troops gathered in the area west of Zichuan and Boshan, and it seems that there is new action again. Ningwu in Shanxi Province was captured on the 1st, and Fanshi was captured on the 4th, and 100,000 troops besieged Datong. And increasing troops in Wenxi, Houma, and the area east of Jiwang Mountain, preparing to attack Jishan. Luochu in eastern Hubei, Zaoyang and Nanzhang in northern Hubei, Dengxian in southern Henan, Han in Anhui Province, Tangyin, Wuzhi, and Wenxian in northern Henan are still under attack. Macheng in eastern Hubei has been captured, and the situation in Yicheng in northern Hubei has become unclear. Three divisions in northern Jiangsu are advancing fiercely towards Liuhe and Lai'an. 20,000 people are gathered between Meng, Pei, Yang, and Yong counties, and the pseudo-army Hao Ju unit, which has been increased to the vicinity of Donghai by the Communist army, is pressing towards Yangshan and Tonghai in two routes. Qingxian, Cangxian, and Machang in Hebei have been under attack since the 6th. The Pinghan, Jinpu, Jiaoji, Tongpu, and Zhengtai railways have all been continuously destroyed. Since the 1st, the areas attacked in the Northeast include Fulongquan west of Huai'de, Erdaogou, Linchang, and the north bank of the Songhua River south of Yingri. On the 4th, the Communist army also shelled the south bank of the Songhua River. The Mongolian Yingzi and Que District north of Beipiao in Rehe Province were also attacked by the Communist army on the 1st.

Communist Army Occupied Areas (Question) Regarding the strength of the Communist army, can you please show us in detail how many troops the Communist army had during and after the war, and how many areas the Communist army occupied during and after the war?

(Minister Peng's Answer) The Communist army issued a declaration on September 22nd of the 26th year of the Republic, voluntarily canceling the Red Army designation. At that time, there were only 45,000 people, and they followed the government's orders and were reorganized into three divisions. The government then approved the establishment of the New Fourth Army under five detachments. On July 16th of the 29th year of the Republic, the Central Government again proposed that in addition to being organized into three armies, six divisions, and three supplementary regiments, the Eighteenth Group Army should also add two supplementary regiments, and the New Fourth Army should have two divisions, and no detachments should be established. Afterwards, the New Fourth Army violated military discipline and was expressly abolished by the Central Government on January 17th of the 30th year of the Republic. In the 33rd year of the Republic, the Communist army requested to be reorganized into sixteen divisions, but the government only allowed it to be reorganized into eight to ten divisions. Last year, when the Communist army negotiated with the government, the Communist side again requested to be reorganized into sixteen armies and forty-eight divisions, sixteen times more than at the beginning of the occupation. At that time, the government reluctantly responded to the Communist side's request and allowed it to be reorganized into 20 divisions, but the Communist army did not comply with the order to reorganize. Before the military reorganization agreement, there were a total of one general headquarters, one army headquarters, and twelve division headquarters. As of June of this year, according to investigations, it has been expanded to two general headquarters (one in the Northeast), fourteen army headquarters (five in the Northeast), forty-three division headquarters (nine in the Northeast), fifty-five military districts, eighty-one independent brigades (thirteen in the Northeast), and sixty-three independent regiments (details of the Northeast and local teams are unknown). In addition, the Communist army in the Northeast has the "Democratic Allied Army," and in North China, there are the "Ji Re Liao Pu Sui," "Jin Ji," "Lu Yu," "Jin Cha Ji," "Shandong," "Shaan Gan Ning," "Central China," and "Central Plains" eight field military regions, and the "Democratic Founding Army," "Democratic Second Allied Army," etc. Its total strength (including local teams and militia) is estimated to be over 800,000. As for the area occupied by the Communist army, before the Japanese surrender, it was 74 counties. From the Japanese surrender to January 13th of this year, another 241 counties were occupied. After the order to stop the conflict on January 13th, another 22 counties were occupied, for a total of 337 counties.

### A Brief Biography of Dr. John Leighton Stuart

Dr. John Leighton Stuart was born in Hangzhou, China in 1876. His father, Stuart, was a devout Christian who came to China to preach very early, so Dr. Stuart lived a Chinese life in his childhood, traveling with his parents to various parts of China, learning Chinese language and writing. His family was a composite of schools, hospitals, and society, isolated in an alien cultural environment, which had a very important influence on him. At the age of eleven, he was sent back to the United States to study. In 1892, he entered Hampton-Sydney College, where his greatest interest was Greek and Latin. At this time, he had a desire to become a university professor. In 1896, he received a Bachelor of Arts degree, and in 1899, he entered the Union Theological Seminary. However, he felt that preaching work was meaningless. In 1902, after graduating from the seminary, he stayed in the Southern Church for two years, raising funds for the church, which was a remarkable achievement. During the trip, he met Miss Luo Anlin and admired her very much. Before coming to China in 1940, he married Miss Luo Anlin. In 1930, the University of Bezeston awarded him an honorary doctorate.

After returning to Hangzhou in 1904, Dr. Stuart helped his father to do missionary work for three years. At this time, he began to study ancient Chinese characters. In 1908, he was hired as a teacher at Nanjing Theological Seminary. From then on, he spent eleven years of school life in Nanjing. He was very satisfied with this quiet environment. At this time, he published many Chinese works. From 1918, Beiping Huiwen College and Linhe College in Tongxian, Hebei were merged into Yenching University, and Dr. Stuart was hired as the president of Yenching University. He did not resign from the hard work and resolutely took on the work of founding the school, until now. Yenching University has used his thirty years of efforts to create and manage, to reach today's position, and it can be comforting that there are many students all over the world.

After the Lugouqiao Incident in the 26th year of the Republic of China, the environment in Beiping deteriorated day by day. Dr. Stuart continued his career with an indomitable spirit. He was obstructed by the Japanese several times, but he still remained calm. During the Anti-Japanese War, he went to Chongqing three times to discuss school matters, in order to maintain contact with the Chinese authorities. Until the outbreak of the Pacific War in the 30th year of the Republic of China, Japan was very hostile to Britain and the United States, and Yenching University was forced to suspend classes, and Dr. Stuart was also detained by the Japanese for three years and eight months. During the time that Dr. Stuart was detained, the Japanese side proposed ceasefire conditions and wanted him to take them to Chongqing. Dr. Stuart flatly refused. His loyalty to China can be seen from this. He was only released after Japan surrendered in the 34th year of the Republic of China.

Dr. Stuart was born in China, and his life's work is also in China. China is his second hometown, and he has long considered himself to be Chinese.

[Report from this Newspaper] After UNRRA Director LaGuardia announced that relief supplies would be suspended to our country starting yesterday, the reporter specifically went to the "Executive Headquarters" to inquire. A spokesperson for the Executive Headquarters stated that the agency had not yet received official notification. In fact, it was due to unavoidable circumstances. As for the so-called uneven distribution, it seems that the main point is that the Communist areas received less. However, the main reason is also due to inconvenient transportation. The extreme lack of supplies in areas controlled by the Communist Party is indeed a fact, but the Executive Headquarters has also tried its best to transport relief supplies to Communist areas such as Linyi, northern Henan, and Lishan in Hubei. Furthermore, Director Jiang also agreed with Mr. Zhou Enlai on four points: (1) All those in the Communist areas affected by war, regardless of race, religion, or political belief, will receive relief; (2) The Executive Headquarters will never interfere in local administration; (3) The Communist Party can send representatives to participate in the relief work in the "Communist area"; (4) If relief workers or vehicles are detained, the Executive Headquarters will withdraw. All work is being carried out in accordance with this principle. It is generally speculated that LaGuardia's current ban on the shipment of supplies to China is temporary in nature.

### Executive Headquarters Establishes Office in Yantai

[Another Report] The Executive Headquarters announced that it will soon establish an office directly under the headquarters in Yantai, with Wang Shiliang, a non-partisan overseas Chinese from Washington, as the director. Mr. Wang has already led more than ten staff members and Mr. Hedener of UNRRA to set off and prepare everything. There is also an LST vessel carrying 2,000 tons of supplies heading to Yantai. However, because the office is directly under the headquarters, it is currently being submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. It is said that this is the first office established by the Executive Headquarters in a Communist area.

### Executive Headquarters' Deputy Director Responds to Accusations of Selling Food, Citing Difficulties

[Reuters, Nanjing, 10th of this Month] After UNRRA staff sent a joint telegram to Director LaGuardia accusing the Chinese government of misusing UNRRA supplies, a Communist Party spokesperson stated that these accusations were all true. According to Communist figures, only 5/1000 of UNRRA supplies were transported to Communist-controlled areas. According to the Deputy Director of the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the government has not provided the Executive Headquarters with adequate funding, forcing it to sell food needed by countless starving people. This is a fact, but the government should not be criticized for this. The Executive Headquarters is allowed to sell part of UNRRA supplies to make up for the funding shortfall. However, the Executive Headquarters is now facing new difficulties. For example, flour and other items can no longer be sold because there are too many starving people, and labor costs have risen several times. The unloading expenses for one ship of supplies amount to 100 million Legal Tender, not including warehouse storage fees. A total of 170 to 180 ships have been unloaded, so the Executive Headquarters' expenditure in this area is already considerable. Although the Executive Headquarters' funding is not provided by the government, the government has allocated 432,000,000,000,000 yuan in the budget for this year's rehabilitation and relief expenses, of which approximately 380,000,000,000,000 yuan is allocated to transportation, such as the repair of railways, highways, and waterways. Regarding the second point of criticism from UNRRA staff, it is not accurate. They said that the Chinese government violated the agreement by prohibiting the transport of UNRRA supplies to Communist areas, which only accounted for 2% of the total. So far, items such as trains, rails, timber, and some medicines must be handed over to government agencies. Therefore, the so-called percentage obtained by a certain area must only be calculated based on items directly supplied to the people. Trains, rails, etc., should be removed from the total. Transportation disruption is the biggest difficulty in distributing relief supplies, but the Executive Headquarters is still trying its best to transport them, and some UNRRA supplies have also been obtained in the Northeast. Chairman Chiang also consistently advocates for fairness in the distribution of relief supplies.

### Ministry of Finance Approves One-Year Exemption of Business Tax for the Grain Industry

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th of this Month] After the victory, the Ministry of Finance stipulated a one-year exemption from business tax for the grain industry to help stabilize grain prices. Initially, it was limited to rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains, excluding items that had been processed. It is now learned that the Ministry of Finance has expanded the scope to include flour, corn flour, sorghum flour, and flour made from beans and miscellaneous grains, regardless of whether they are manufactured or sold. The tax exemption will be granted from October of last year for one year, and the taxes that have already been paid will be refunded upon presentation of a certificate to the local direct branch bureaus, which are complying with the order.

### Disastrous Conditions in Central and Southern Hubei

[Special Dispatch from Hankou, 10th of this Month] The grain and disaster situation in the areas of Hubei Province are severe. Along the Hankou-Yichang-Xiangyang-Shashi highways, wasteland is everywhere, and beggars fill the roads. Jingmen has suffered more than Yichang, but no one has reported it, so outsiders are unaware.

### Successful Test Run of the Pinghan Railway Express Train Yesterday

[Special Dispatch from Hankou, 10th of this Month] The Pinghan Railway express train successfully completed its test run from Hankou to Xiaogan yesterday. It is scheduled to officially begin operations on the 16th, and it will be possible to reach Zhengzhou from Hankou on the same day. The authorities have adopted the expert opinion and decided to locate the site of the Central China Steel Plant in Shihuiyao, Hubei Province, and have appointed Cheng Zhongshi and Liu Jian to oversee the preparations.

### Active Efforts to Plug Breaches in Hankou City

[Central News Agency, Hankou, 9th of this Month] The Hankou City Flood Prevention Committee is actively plugging breaches surrounding Hankou City. Currently, half of the entire project has been completed. The dike at Yijiadun is extremely dangerous, and the committee has sent technicians with flood prevention equipment to rush repairs. Although the Wuhui Dike in Wuchang County is being repaired, there is no stone or earth nearby, and transportation is extremely difficult due to limited conditions. The river water has been overflowing in recent days, and the danger is greater than before, which is extremely concerning.

### Chairman Chiang Instructs the Executive Yuan to Assist UNRRA to the Best of Its Ability; Orders All National Agencies to Comply Strictly

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th of this Month] Chairman Chiang is extremely concerned about the work of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. This month, he specially instructed the Executive Yuan to order all national military and political agencies to assist to the best of their ability. The original order stated: The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration was jointly established by our country and the Allied nations in November of the year before last. Its main task is to provide residents of recovered areas in this war with food, clothing, and shelter, as well as to provide assistance and relief to prevent epidemics and restore health, and to engage in the rehabilitation of agricultural and industrial production and public utilities. All distribution and disbursement of rehabilitation and relief supplies will not discriminate against disaster victims based on race, religion, or political affiliation. UNRRA is now successively providing material assistance to our country and sending experts to assist the government. The Executive Yuan has specially established the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to oversee national relief and rehabilitation matters, which is a major task after the war. However, this matter is extensive and complex, and all relevant agencies should do their best to assist in order to achieve results as soon as possible, especially military agencies and troops, which should assist at any time and any place. Regarding transportation, priority should be given to the transportation of relief and rehabilitation supplies and personnel, and no delays or obstruction of passage should be allowed. In addition, existing hospitals and housing in various places that are currently used for military purposes should be vacated immediately so that the medical supplies provided by UNRRA can be fully utilized through this existing architecture. Furthermore, military vehicles from various units that can be used to transport relief supplies should also be temporarily lent as much as possible, and efforts should be made to work together, act righteously, and be courageous so that disaster relief can be timely and the wounds of the people can be healed as soon as possible, which is deeply hoped.

### Repeating the Old Trick of the Traitor Chu Minyi; Traitor Mei Siping Seeks Retrial; The Capital High Court Tried Traitor Chen Junhui Yesterday; The Eldest Son of Traitor Wang Was Indicted, The Second Son Was Released

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th of this Month] The date of execution of traitor Mei Siping is being closely watched by all parties. However, according to news from the Capital High Court on the 10th, traitor Mei actually repeated the old trick of traitor Chu Minyi, submitting a petition to the court for a retrial. The reasons cited were: (1) He maintained security and order in the Beijing Railway; (2) He assisted in the central government's takeover work; (3) He maintained public utilities; (4) He assisted in the war of resistance; (5) He was beneficial to the people. It is reported that the High Court will review the case to decide whether to accept it.

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 10th of this Month] Pseudo-Industry Minister, traitor Chen Junhui, was tried at the Capital High Court this morning at 10 a.m. According to traitor Chen, he was most opposed to the organization of the pseudo-government at the time, but because of his deep relationship with traitor Wang, he could not bear to leave. He defended himself with fifteen points, recounting his excuses for serving in the pseudo-government, such as repairing water conservancy, manufacturing agricultural implements, protecting industry, and sheltering underground workers. The court stated that his statements were all empty words with no basis and announced that the case would be retried after collecting evidence.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th of this Month] Wang Zhaoming's eldest son (Mengjin), who was previously arrested by the Capital High Court on charges of treason, was formally indicted on the 10th. Wang's second son, Wendi, was sentenced to one year and six months imprisonment with a five-year suspended sentence by the Capital High Court on June 26 for treason. Since neither the defendant nor the prosecutor requested a review of the case during this period, the court officially released him today and ordered the Northern District Police Bureau to be responsible for his protection.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 10th of this Month] Cultural traitor Luo Qingshan was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment, deprived of public rights for 10 years, and all property confiscated by the Hebei High Court Criminal Division this afternoon.

### Welcoming Ambassador Stuart

The day before yesterday, U.S. President Truman appointed Dr. Stuart as the U.S. Ambassador to China. This is such delightful good news for us! Especially at this time of precarious and unsettling situation in the Far East, the dispatch of Dr. Stuart, who has always advocated that the U.S. and Soviet Union should reach an understanding on their policies towards China, to China as ambassador will certainly contribute to the peace in the Far East. Our welcome to this new ambassador goes without saying.

The relationship between China and the United States has always been known for its cordiality. After being tempered by eight years of war, it has become even more solid and has become a friendship forged in adversity. The United States initially extended sympathy to our resistance against Japan in spirit, and then provided as much assistance as possible in terms of material. The Chinese people are indeed deeply grateful, and what is especially rare is that the United States has often acted as China's honest friend, offering faithful advice and good guidance, enabling China to move forward on the road to democracy after the war, and not hesitating to help China become a strong, unified, and democratic nation at any cost. Since President Truman announced his China policy in December of last year, he has been moving towards this goal without change. Although the change of the U.S. Ambassador to China is a common event in diplomacy, with international relations becoming increasingly close, mutual assistance and trust between countries rely on mutual understanding. Dr. Stuart can be said to be the first person in the United States to have the clearest understanding of China. This time, he has been ordered to visit China, which will not only enhance the friendship between China and the United States, but also further have a positive impact on the entire Far East situation.

Dr. Stuart was born in Hangzhou, China. For fifty of his seventy years, he lived in China. It is not an exaggeration to say that China is his second hometown. He not only understands our country's national conditions and the characteristics of our nation, but also has a deep understanding of our country's political situation and the opinions of our people. Moreover, because he has lived in China for a long time, he is well-versed in Chinese language and writing, and his words, actions, and thoughts can interact well with Chinese people. His contribution to China includes his dedication to education, serving as the president of Yenching University for thirty years, with students all over the world. What is most admirable about him throughout his life is that after the outbreak of the Pacific War, he was detained in a concentration camp by the Japanese army, but his noble integrity made the Japanese have to respect him. Although they tried every means to coerce and tempt him, asking him to carry the Japanese conditions for peace with China to Chongqing, he resolutely refused with righteousness and dignity, preferring to go hungry and suffer rather than running errands for the Japanese invaders. This spirit is forever worthy of our gratitude. On the day of his seventieth birthday this year, our government specially issued a decree praising him, which is a glorious page in the history of Sino-U.S. cultural exchange.

President Truman's appointment of such a "friend of China" as ambassador to China also shows his emphasis on the China issue. In recent weeks, because the Communist Party has based its arguments on anti-American arguments in Moscow newspapers, it has tried to incite anti-American sentiment among the Chinese people in various ways, and even at the cost of spreading rumors that are unfavorable to China among American friends, creating estrangement between China and the United States, such as the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) temporarily suspending the shipment of relief supplies to China, etc., and then using these facts as an opportunity to provoke the Chinese people's anti-American sentiment. China and the United States were originally like-minded friends in adversity, but the CCP has been sowing discord from within. Therefore, the relationship between China and the United States seems to be encountering a test. Whether in the United States or in China, at this time, the layer of thin clouds in front of us should be swept away. This newspaper, which has a history of more than seventy years, is willing to represent the opinions of the general public of China as a reporter, believing that the more conspiracies there are to undermine the relationship between China and the United States, the more necessary it is for China and the United States to be frank and sincere with each other. Therefore, Dr. Stuart's mission at this time is not only to strengthen the cooperation between the two governments, but especially to promote close cooperation between the peoples of the two countries.

Dr. Stuart is naturally endowed with dual qualifications: on the one hand, he is a legal citizen of New York, USA; on the other hand, he was born in Hangzhou, China, and China is his second hometown. The U.S. president dispatched such a person to China as ambassador, which is already more appropriate than others in promoting mutual understanding between the people of China and the United States, and moreover, he is an educator. Employing an educator as a diplomat can better accomplish this mission. Therefore, we also believe that if international cooperation is truly desired, if world peace is truly desired, the re-education of the world seems to be a factor that cannot be ignored. In recent years, the world has seen a general decline in morality and the near extinction of human nature due to the war. Human wisdom seems to be entirely used for lethal weapons, and human civilization is in danger of complete destruction. If we want human survival and world peace, we must awaken the deluded humanity. Dr. Stuart has been engaged in education in China for decades. After the fall of Peiping and Tianjin, even in the midst of hardship and difficulty, he still used the name of the "American Education Association" to preside over the affairs of Yenching University, assisting the young people who were resisting the war behind enemy lines, and he is truly worthy of being a great educator of our time. This time, he will be appointed as ambassador, and he will surely be able to use his educational background to address current malpractices, so that the people will move more towards the path of peace, and he will also be able to provide great assistance to Special Envoy Marshall, so that his arduous mission can be completed in the end.

Today, the political situation in the Far East depends entirely on the close cooperation between China and the United States, but the power of Britain and the Soviet Union, especially the Soviet Union in the north, is also a major factor in stabilizing the Far East. Dr. Stuart has been in the north for a long time and knows the movements of the Soviet Union well. Then he should be able to do his best to further promote a thorough understanding between China and the Soviet Union and the United States and the Soviet Union, thereby laying a solid foundation for peace in the Far East. We welcome this new ambassador not only for China, but also for the Far East and for the world.

### The Three Provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Establish Silk Reeling Loans with a Total Amount of 10 Billion, Zhejiang Can Receive Half of the Allocation

[Our Newspaper Hangzhou Express] Silk manufacturers in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces previously appealed to the Executive Yuan, requesting that the Four Joint Offices be instructed to provide silk reeling loans of 12 billion to prevent silk mills from shutting down due to lack of funds. Now, the Zhongfu Company and the Shanghai Silver Group of the Central Bank have settled the matter and approved the loan amount of 10 billion, stipulating that the degree of uniformity be 20 and 22 points at 900,000 yuan per dan (unit of weight), and 13 and 15 points at 1.2 million yuan per dan. The loan will be paid after each batch of five dan of silk is produced. The Zhejiang District Collection and Management Office received a telegram from Shanghai on the 9th, stating that the loan was formally signed on the 8th. Manufacturers in Zhejiang Province can sign contracts with the management office separately after the original copy of the contract is sent, and follow the procedures for payment. After the implementation of this loan, the silk mills can be fully operational. At the same time, the 75,000 dan of dried cocoon purchased by the government from Japan have been concentrated in Kobe. General Manager Ge of Zhongfu has completed the passport procedures in Shanghai and will go to receive them with Director Du of the Technical Department in order to transport them back to China to be used as raw materials for various silk mills. It is said that the silk mills in Zhejiang Province can be allocated 5 billion yuan from this silk reeling loan.

Suzhou

Military Police Arrest a Derelict Official

Zhou Weixin, a lieutenant adjutant of a certain regiment in Shanghai, is thirty years old. He often frequented singing halls and dance halls. Last month, he met a beautiful young woman named Wang Bingzhong. After pursuing her with all his might, they eventually had an affair and got engaged. Zhou spent lavishly for more than a month and was in dire financial straits. He secretly sold public property and embezzled public funds. When his superiors discovered this, Zhou, fearing punishment, took a large sum of public funds and fled through the border. He first went to Nanjing, then to Changshu, and then married Wang Bingzhong. On the 5th of this month, he came to Suzhou with his family to seek a job, using the alias Huang Jianan. He stayed at the Lixiang Hotel at No. 113. After the military police team stationed in Suzhou learned of the situation, they arrested him on the 8th and will send him to be dealt with according to law soon.

Wuxi

A Fake County Magistrate Rampages in Tai Lake

Before the war, Tai Lake was always a lair for bandits. The government believed that the lake surface was vast and beyond its reach, so the bandits' whereabouts were constantly being suppressed. After the victory, the enemy bandits collapsed. Yang Yibin, a local resident who had served as the director of the puppet Jiangsu Security Office and the puppet county magistrate of Wuxi and Wujiang, claimed to be the commander-in-chief of Tai Lake. Recently, the self-defense team of Huazhuang Town in the area received secret reports that a large number of lake bandits, more than 3,000 people, were using more than 40 ships. They were divided into four teams, implementing abductions for ransom and looting passing merchants. A team was specially dispatched to patrol to prevent banditry. A few days ago, a villager named Feng from Jing County, who often transported water from Changxing, Zhejiang, to Wuxi for sale, was intercepted by lake bandits on the way through Cangshan in Tai Lake and robbed of many valuable clothes and 6 million national currency.

At 2:00 PM on the 5th of this month, more than 8,000 Communist troops, carrying more than ten cannons, launched a fierce attack on the National Army's positions in Yaojiadai and Shilibu in Taixing. The artillery fire was unprecedentedly intense. The Communist troops only began to withdraw after 9:00 AM on the 6th, but they are still gathering nearby, appearing to be preparing to attack Taixing County.

Luhe

National Army Captures Disguised Bandits

Eight new bandits here, disguised as egg vendors, were passing through the Pulu Highway. After being questioned by the National Army, one of the bandits attempted to escape and was shot, but not killed. He has now been taken to the 58th Brigade for interrogation. Seven bandits infiltrated the urban area to gather information. Among them were a monk and a rural woman. They were captured a few days ago and handed over to the county government for custody, pending disposal.

Bengbu

The Municipal Office Plans to Establish a New Power Plant

The existing power plant here has outdated machinery, and its power generation efficiency is gradually declining. The Municipal Preparatory Office recently plans to set up a new plant in Bengbu. Director Zhang Xuexin of the Bureau of Public Works was sent to Shanghai to contact the Executive Headquarters to purchase and transport new machines. The result was very satisfactory. It will cost more than 30,000 yuan. The Municipal Office is actively raising funds.

Yuyao

Implementing a Surprise Household Registration Check

In order to tighten household administration and maintain public security, the county government, together with the county party headquarters and the police station, implemented a surprise household registration check starting on the night of the 1st of this month. It was divided into four groups with 28 subgroups. 112 inspectors were deployed by the county self-defense brigade to conduct patrols and inspections by bao and jia (administrative divisions). That night, they found 13 unregistered households and suspects, who were sent to the police station for investigation according to law.

### Correction Letter

I have read the news item on page 2 of your newspaper on July 7th, which stated that Lu Facheng served as a border area committee member in the puppet regime, which is not true. It was found that in May of the 29th year, the puppet organization unilaterally published a notice listing Facheng as a puppet border area committee member. At that time, Facheng was the county magistrate of Qingpu. After reading the newspaper, he wrote to clarify the facts. In June of the same year, he reported to the Third War Zone Headquarters and the Jiangsu Provincial Government and received telegrams of commendation. He was also appointed to continue working in the Jiangnan Administrative Office until the victory, without ever stepping into the occupied area. The facts are all there. I am writing to request a correction. Sincerely, Lu Facheng

### Soviet Representative Relinquishes Stubborn Attitude The Peace Conference Will Be Convened by the Five Powers The United Nations General Assembly Will Be Held on September 23rd The United States and the Soviet Union Engage in Heated Debate Over the German Question

[Our Newspaper News] London, 10th Broadcast: Britain and the United States achieved another important victory in the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference today, and this victory is closely related to China's dignity. After pressure from Britain and the United States, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov no longer opposes China becoming an invited nation to the 21-Nation Peace Conference. The Soviet Union's abandonment of its stubborn attitude makes people feel optimistic about the future of the peace conference.

[United Press Paris, 9th] Today, the Soviet Union showed its concession, and the Four Powers have decided to include China in the list of nations invited to the peace conference. According to the original plan, the 21-Nation Peace Conference was scheduled to be held in Paris on July 29th. The Soviet Union initially requested that China not be included in the list of nations invited to the peace conference, believing that this matter should be handled solely by the Four Powers. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes, although he recognized that this move would be an insult to China, ultimately agreed to this request. The Chinese government protested this method, believing that it was far from the Moscow Agreement, which stipulated that the peace conference should be convened by the "Council of Foreign Ministers."

[Reuters Paris, 10th] The Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference decided yesterday to request UN Secretary-General Lie to postpone the United Nations General Assembly, originally scheduled to be held on September 3rd, to September 23rd. Lie had previously sent a letter to the Foreign Ministers Conference, seeking opinions on the date of the UN General Assembly. Byrnes said that after the opening of the peace conference, the four foreign ministers still need to meet to discuss the final agreement of the peace treaty, so the date of the UN General Assembly must be postponed. As a result, it was agreed to change the date to September 23rd.

Regarding the procedural law of the 21-Nation Peace Conference, the four foreign ministers reached a complete agreement after some amendments. Regarding the Trieste issue, at Byrnes's suggestion, it was agreed to establish a special committee to study the status of the port and submit a report before the convening of the peace conference.

[Reuters Paris, 9th] The Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference entered its final stage this afternoon. After the agreement on the issuance of invitations was reached last night, it cleared the way for discussing the complex issue of Germany. The four foreign ministers discussed the German issue until 7:30 PM. Molotov severely criticized U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes's 25-year plan for the management of Germany, which was proposed on April 29th, and advocated extending it to 40 years. Byrnes also retorted sharply, saying that this treaty only aims to disarm Germany and does not involve issues such as reparations, which he has suggested be discussed separately by representatives of the foreign ministers. With less than three weeks until the convening of the peace conference and the Foreign Ministers Conference coming to an end, conference officials expect that there will not be any progress in resolving the German issue during this period. Britain and the United States will submit a report on the German issue at the next Foreign Ministers Conference. After the German issue, there are still the political issues of Austria and Italy, which are still on the official agenda of the Foreign Ministers Conference.

### Abyssinia Opposes the Decision on Italian Territories

Submitting a Protest to the Four Foreign Ministers

[Our Newspaper News] New York, 10th Broadcast: Abyssinia today submitted a strong protest to the Four Powers through diplomatic channels, opposing the decision made at the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference to postpone the final decision on Italian colonies for one year. It stated that if Italian East Africa is still returned to Italy, it will be an unreasonable act and will affect the economic stability of the region.

### Those Arrested in Trieste Hold a Mass Hunger Strike Demanding Soviet Intervention

[Reuters Trieste, 9th] After many people were arrested in the recent riots in Trieste, they began a hunger strike at midnight on Saturday and demanded that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov intervene "to protect the democratic organizations of Venezia Giulia." The number of people arrested is unknown, but it is reported that there are about a hundred people in the Via Cologna prison.

### The Soviet Union Violates the Moscow Agreement British and American Newspapers Unanimously Criticize Concessions to This Are a Disgrace

[Central News Agency New York, 8th Special Dispatch] The New York Times commented today on the Soviet Foreign Minister's insistence on obstructing China from being an invited nation to the peace conference, saying, "This is clearly directed by its distorted Far East policy." The article criticized the Soviet Union for violating its own previous agreement and pointed out that the Foreign Ministers Conference held in Moscow last October included China. The article attacked the Soviet Union's insistence on the Four Powers formulating the rules of procedure for the peace conference, saying, "No representative of any country can tolerate such an order proposed by the Soviet Union." Furthermore, "The Soviet Union's desire to forcibly formulate the rules of procedure for the peace conference undoubtedly attempts to make the peace conference, like the Security Council, succumb to its will and be unable to take action." The newspaper said that if democratic countries concede on this point, it will make the entire peace conference merely a disgrace.

[Central News Agency London, 9th Special Dispatch] The Daily Telegraph commented on the Soviet Union's firm rejection of China from being among the nations invited to the peace conference, saying that its heart is too narrow. All newspapers carried China's protest, but the Daily Telegraph is still the only one to write a critique.

### Philippine President Roxas Meets With Our Reporter for the First Time He Says the Sino-Philippine Trade Agreement Will Be Signed Soon Overseas Chinese in the Philippines Will Receive Equal Treatment

[Central News Agency Reporter Li Yipei Manila, 8th] This reporter visited Philippine President Roxas at the Malacañang Palace this afternoon and asked about the Philippines' one-boat policy toward overseas Chinese. He replied that overseas Chinese in the Philippines will receive the most favored nation status and privileges stipulated by international law and will receive equal opportunities and protection under the law. The Philippines has laws that treat all ethnic groups equally. The other two foreign reporters, Boda of the Philadelphia Bulletin and Ms. Linde of the American "This Week" magazine, were also present. This is the second time that the Philippine President has met with foreign reporters since taking office, but it is the first time that he has met with a reporter from our country. President Roxas spoke about the Sino-Philippine trade agreement that is about to be signed and said that he hopes the agreement "will be signed soon." He said that China will receive the most favored nation clause equivalent to that of other countries, but not the same as the United States. Because the Philippines still maintains a special relationship with the United States, advisors from the U.S. State Department will assist the Republic of the Philippines in concluding various trade agreements with other countries. The reporter asked whether the Philippine government intends to send a commercial delegation abroad. President Roxas replied that the current focus of the Philippine people is on importing from abroad rather than exporting, so there is no such plan at present. The issue of establishing an embassy or legation in Nanjing has not been fully decided. When talking about the date of his visit to China, the reporter assured him that the Chinese government and people would warmly welcome him. He smiled and replied, "Thank you for telling me, I am very grateful. I am eager to visit China, because I have been to your country many times. When I was nine years old, I went to Guangzhou, but because there are many tasks to be dealt with at present, I am afraid that I will not be able to make the trip in the near future."

### Our Delegation to the Philippines Will Leave the Philippines for Shanghai Today

[Central News Agency Manila, 9th] Our delegation to the Philippines is scheduled to fly directly to Shanghai on the morning of the 11th on the same plane. Special Envoy Gan Naiguang and Consul General Duan Maolan visited U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines McNutt at 2:00 PM this afternoon for a 30-minute meeting. It is reported that Gan handed over several photos given by Chairman Chiang to McNutt. Trade negotiations between China and the Philippines have not yet begun. As Roxas hinted, the Sino-Philippine trade agreement may be signed after the delegation leaves the Philippines.

### Ambassador Gu Weijun Visits Acheson

[United States Information Service Washington, 9th] Before presenting his credentials to President Truman, the new Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Gu Weijun, visited Acting Secretary of State Acheson for the first time today. Ambassador Gu then told reporters that he hoped that the mission of President's Special Envoy General Marshall in China would be successful and that a solution to all problems could be found.

### The Control Council for Japan Meets U.S. Representative Acheson Attacks Communism Points Out That the Labor Law Contains a Strong Ideological Flavor and Is Not Applicable to a Democratized Japan

[Remodeling Society Tokyo, 10th] The Four-Power Control Council for Japan met this morning to discuss: (1) the issue of returning Japanese to normal life, (2) the issue of quarantine, (3) the issue of preventing infectious diseases, (4) the food and drug law, (5) the law on controlling unified food salespersons and food distribution agencies (above are proposals by MacArthur), (6) the issue of the War Investigation Committee, (7) Japan's labor law, (8) the issue of military compensation (above are proposals by the Soviet representative).

[Central News Agency Tokyo, 10th Special Dispatch] The atmosphere at the Four-Power Council for Japan meeting this morning was quite discordant. The reason was that British representative Bower was interrupted twice by the meeting's chairman, U.S. representative Acheson, when explaining the issue of integrating the repatriated Japanese soldiers and civilians into their national life was related to all other issues. Later, the meeting was frustrated because the representatives refused to discuss the four new matters proposed by MacArthur. The reason for the representatives' refusal to discuss the four matters was that the matters were too specialized and not related to the government controlling Japan only. Our representative Zhu Shuming declared that if the above request was insisted upon, the Chinese government would be prepared to provide experts on the above issues to the Allied Headquarters. The British and Soviet representatives also made similar statements.

[Remodeling Society Telegraph] Then the Soviet representative put forward its proposed amendment to the labor law, advocating that when the factory closes the factory, the workers should directly manage the factory's production on behalf of the factory. Acheson then made an important speech on this, fiercely criticizing the definition of common production, saying that it is necessary to ask questions about the Soviet Union's proposals, and that many of the first suggestions have been implemented and should not be submitted to the Committee for discussion as a new proposal. The goal of labor in Japan is to establish democratic principles, and Japanese labor laws and regulations should be decided according to these principles. If detailed instructions are encountered, the United Nations may be accused of dictatorship and violate the Potsdam Declaration. The Supreme Commander does not intend to forcibly enforce various regulations on Japan during military occupation, because forcibly enforcing things is contrary to the freedom that we are giving the Japanese at this time. After carefully examining the Soviet Union's proposal, I felt that it had ideological colors and was propagandistic. It is regrettable that communism and even the labor problems of communists are occurring in Japan today. I dare not criticize the Soviet Union's communist system, but I do not want to cultivate communism in Japan. I only want to make Japan implement democratic principles, and the Japanese are also striving to obtain the benefits of democracy for their own welfare.

[Our Newspaper Report] London, 10th Broadcast: Nehru declared at a meeting of the Indian National Congress today that India will conclude an important agreement with Britain, which will be realized before the establishment of the Indian interim government.

[Reuters, Bombay, 10th] Nehru held his first press conference since taking office as Chairman of the National Congress Party, stating that the National Congress Party cannot accept any treaty that Britain wants to impose on India, nor can it accept its attempt to retain its vested interests in India. If it can be accepted, the National Congress Party does not have any tasks for the Constituent Assembly, only knowing how to serve the people.

The powers of the Constituent Assembly are now limited to two matters, namely (1) minority ethnic issues, and (2) treaties with India. Minority ethnic issues are purely domestic matters, and we all hope to achieve satisfactory solutions. Regarding the future relationship between Britain and India, we also hope to establish a treaty of peace. Once the National Congress Party participates in the Constituent Assembly, it will work to achieve it.

### "Atomized Coal" Powder Engine: High Speed and Low Cost

[United Press, Baltimore, 9th] The United States has recently invented a locomotive powered by coal, which is said to be faster than diesel-powered locomotives and will soon be tested. The locomotive's power comes from a gas turbine that burns coal powder as fine as talcum powder.  This "atomized" coal powder is cheaper than diesel fuel. The Locomotive Improvement Research Committee, affiliated with the U.S. Coal Research Institute, said that the new gas turbine locomotive has been successful. The research of the new locomotive is being led by engineering physicist Yerutti. The new locomotive operates as follows: First, coal is crushed and ground into powder, then blown into a disperser by compressed airflow, turning it into a fine powder, which enters the burner and is burned with compressed air. The combustion of coal powder generates tremendous heat, increasing the air temperature and rotating a high-speed turbine. The turbine can then drive a generator to supply electricity and turn the wheels.

### International Tribunal Prosecutor Reads Documents from Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Liquidating the Blood Debt of Japanese Aggression Against China: Araki and Tanaka's Confessions Expose Conspiracy: Roosevelt's Telegram to the Japanese Emperor Repeated

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 10th] The International Tribunal prosecutor, while continuing to summarize Araki Sadao's confession today, stated that Araki Sadao revealed that, in addition to the three northeastern provinces, Jehol Province was also included in the Kwantung Army's occupation area to prevent Zhang Xueliang from using the province as a base for a counterattack against the Northeast. This was decided in a secret council meeting in Japan and later unanimously approved by the Imperial Conference. Participants in the Imperial Conference included cabinet members and advisors to the Privy Council. At that time, U.S. Ambassador to Japan Forbes telegraphed the U.S. Secretary of State stating that the Japanese government had assured him that Chinese sovereignty would not be harmed. On December 1, 1931, the Japanese government sent officials to the U.S. Embassy in Japan to assure Ambassador Forbes that Japan would not expand the Northeast Incident to the point where China lost its sovereignty. Forbes then continued in the telegram: "The Japanese are still actively preparing for further incursions into the Northeast in the future, and the Japanese military once they have the opportunity to act freely, can launch". The first telegram was sent on November 24, 1931. It stated that Japanese Foreign Minister Kijuro Shidehara had notified Forbes that the Japanese Prime Minister, Minister of the Army, and Chief of Staff had agreed not to allow war in Jinzhou. Because banditry was rampant in the Northeast, Japanese residents in the area needed the protection of the Japanese army.

Six Years of Aggression

[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 10th] Next, the prosecutor read the section of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' announcement of "Japanese Military Aggressions from September 18, 1931, to August 3, 1937" titled "Japanese Military Occupation of the Four Provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Jehol," stating: "After occupying Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, the Japanese military continued its plan to invade the west. After the end of the Shanghai War in the spring of 1932, it strengthened its military force in the northeastern provinces. In mid-July 1932, the Japanese, on the pretext of the disappearance of Japanese army officer Ishimoto, began attacking Jehol. In July and August, they launched two general offensives, but they were resisted by the Chinese army and made no progress. At the beginning of 1933, war broke out at Juyuanguan, Shanhaiguan, and Jiumentou fell successively, and the situation between China and Japan worsened. On February 22 of the same year, the Japanese, in the name of the puppet 'Manchukuo', issued an ultimatum to China, claiming that Jehol was not Chinese territory and demanding that Chinese troops in Jehol Province withdraw within 24 hours. On February 25 of the same year, fighting began. The Japanese army launched a general offensive from the bases of Tongda and Suiyuan. On March 2 of the same year, Jehol Province was also occupied by Japan for military and political reasons."

Prosecutor Liu Ailin then read the full text of the Tanggu Truce Agreement, and Prosecutor Haider then presented various evidentiary documents. Finally, the court adjourned the hearing due to the hot weather, and it will resume on the morning of the 15th, when ventilation equipment can be installed in the courtroom. Wiebe said: "This is an unprecedented major case, and we should have reasonable comfort."

Tanggu Truce Agreement [Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 10th] After the Japanese aggression against the Northeast, they then forcibly attempted to seize North China, which was testified by former Military Affairs Bureau Chief Yuzhong Takashi in court. At that time, Deputy Minister of National Defense Tsung-chun, who was in charge in North China with Doihara, will also testify in court. The truth at that time will surely come to light. According to the Japanese invasion of North China, the Shanhaiguan incident on New Year's Day in 1935 marked the beginning. After the occupation of Jehol Province in March, it came to an end, and then the Xu Yue Great Wall went south. At that time, the Kwantung Army was doing its best to carry out political work. In April, the Japanese army challenged Gutsu and attacked various passes of the Great Wall. In May, they approached Pingjin, resulting in the establishment of the Tanggu Truce Agreement. From the establishment of the agreement to the establishment of the pseudo-organization in eastern Hebei in December of the same year, the work of the Japanese invasion of North China was roughly successful. Japan carried out military and political work in this way, causing the July 7th Incident. The reasons are as follows: (1) The Tanggu Truce Agreement (May) made the Pingjin area a demilitarized zone, and Japan re-consolidated its basis for sweeping North China and excluding our central forces from the five provinces of North China. (2) The Bomei Agreement (June) officially recognized the Tanggu Truce Agreement. (3) The Zhangbei Incident (June) Four Japanese soldiers forcibly passed through Zhangjiakou (4) The Doihara and Qin Dechun Agreement (June), Japan resolved the Zhangbei Incident by this agreement, expelled the central forces of Chahar Province, and supported De...(5) The Fengtai Incident (September), on the pretext of the conflict between the Chinese and Japanese armies in Fengtai, increased the garrison force of the Japanese army. (6) The Bailing Temple Incident (from summer to autumn), the Dewang, manipulated by the Japanese army, had an armed conflict with General Chuan Zuoyi, and Japan failed. (7) The establishment of the so-called Eastern Hebei Anti-Communist Autonomous Committee, Yin Rugeng was willing to be a puppet, organized a regime, and was used by the Japanese army politically and economically. (8) The establishment of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee (December) At that time, Japan attempted to appease General Song Zheyuan, who had strength in North China, and appointed him as the chairman of the committee to separate North China from the central government. Doihara was very active at that time.

Eve of Pearl Harbor

[United Press, Tokyo, 9th] What was Emperor Hirohito's reaction to President Roosevelt's personal telegram in late 1941 urging a final peace? The matter is now being raised again. A few weeks ago, it was expected that this issue would be thoroughly explored in the war crimes trials. According to Yamamoto, who was then the head of the American Affairs Section of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Emperor received the telegram and prepared a hopeful reply shortly before the Pearl Harbor attack. However, according to former Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Kido, who told reporters last September that Hirohito refused to answer the telegram because cabinet ministers told him that "resisting the domestic war trend would be futile." Currently, only a few people know the truth about this matter. One of them is former Foreign Minister Togo. It is generally believed that Togo received the telegram from former U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew that morning and immediately submitted it to the Emperor. Opinions differ among other Japanese regarding various issues during this important period. One of them claimed that the Emperor received the telegram at the Imperial Conference, retired to his private quarters, and wept over the difficulty of ensuring peace, but this claim has not been confirmed. Yamamoto did not attend the meeting, so he only received the report indirectly. He learned that Togo had shelved the telegram of President Roosevelt until 25 minutes after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor before submitting it to the Emperor. The Emperor then personally began to draft a reply expressing his desire for peace. Some witnesses in court strongly argued that the Emperor received full reports on the Manchurian Incident but was powerless to stop it.

Tanaka's Testimony Completed

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 9th] Lieutenant General Tanaka Ryukichi, who testified for the prosecution and was questioned by defense lawyers in the war crimes trials for the past four days, left the witness stand this afternoon. Some lawyers attempted to dismiss his testimony by claiming that he was mentally deranged, but they failed.

Reading of Nanjiro's Speech

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 9th] The Tokyo International Tribunal prosecutor submitted to the International Tribunal a summary of the speech delivered by former Japanese Army Minister Nanjiro at a meeting of Japanese division commanders in 1931, as published in Japanese newspapers, as an official record. The speech criticized China's policies, which were unfavorable to Japan, and emphasized that Manchuria and Mongolia should maintain close relations, regardless of whether viewed from the perspective of national defense or political economy. The defense lawyers strongly opposed submitting only a summary to the court and demanded the submission of the full text of the speech. They criticized the prosecutor for presenting such evidence, saying, "I know the prosecutor has the full text in hand." The prosecutor proved that he was indeed unable to obtain the full text, and the defense lawyers withdrew their criticism and apologized to him.

### Investigation of the Major Corruption Case in the Railway Bureau: Female Employees Appear in Court Together: Candidly Narrating the Inside Story of Embezzlement: All Bribery Suspects Bow Their Heads in Admission, but the Director Still Says He Knows Nothing: Yu Xiangyan Throws Another "Letter"

[Our Newspaper Report] The major corruption case in the Railway Bureau was opened for investigation again by Prosecutor Quan at 11:30 AM yesterday. Those who were brought in for questioning included five suspects, namely the main offender, Director of Materials Zhang Hongtu, and accomplices Chen Jingyao, Zhang Bokang, Jing Weijun, and Ding Shuhui. Secret informants Huang Ruzhen and Shen Guizhang were also summoned at the same time. Yesterday morning, at about 9:00 AM, the suspects were brought out of the detention center by bailiffs, and soon after, the informants also reported to the District Procuratorate. Shen and Huang were originally female employees of the bureau. During yesterday's interrogation, Shen Guizhang wore a black silk cheongsam and white leather shoes, while Huang Ruzhen wore a pink short cheongsam with small floral patterns and white leather shoes barefoot. They were both in their twenties and reported the case because they did not want to accept the embezzled funds of 200,000 yuan per person. It is said that Zhang Hongtu received 30% of all the embezzled funds, Deputy Director Jing Weijun and Materials Section Zhang Bokang each received 20%, and the remaining 30% was distributed to employees Yu Peien, Ding Shuhui, Zhang Zelong, Wang Renmao, Zhu Peizong, Gu Zhenmin, Zhu Biwen, Xia Dingwu, Chen Jingyao, Li Jie, Sun Xuesan, Li Runsheng, and Zhang Kaiyuan. Because Shen and Huang described the details of the embezzlement and distribution of spoils in great detail, the bribery suspects had to admit to the bribes. Only the main suspect Zhang Hongtu continued to deny everything. The interrogation ended at 1:30 PM. Shen Guizhang and Huang Ruzhen were both ordered to return home, while the other suspects were still sent back to the detention center. Also, Xu Chuangui, He Zhidao, and He Zu'en have been transferred from the Railway Bureau to the District Procuratorate. After a brief interrogation, they were also detained in the detention center. It is heard that their crimes are relatively minor. However, according to Prosecutor Quan's statement to reporters, he intends to resolve the case as soon as possible, so all suspects will not be easily granted bail. Currently, except for Yu Xiangyan, who is still at large, and worker Li Runsheng, who has been released on bail, the other eighteen defendants are temporarily detained in the District Court detention center for daily interrogation. It is also reliably informed that Prosecutor Quan will open the court again this morning to investigate Zhang Hongtu and other suspects.

### Another Staff Member Colluded in Fraud

[Special Dispatch] Yu Xiangyan, a key figure in the Road Bureau fraud case who has not yet turned himself in, sent another letter to this newspaper yesterday. He included copies of letters to Chen Bozhuang, the Director of the Two Road Bureaus, and Wang Zhaohuai, the Chief of the Police Department, in which he defended himself. Excerpts from the original letters are as follows: (1) "…The occurrence of the Two Road Bureaus fraud case has an inside story, the main reason being a lack of cooperation with them… Fortunately, the current authorities are not lacking in virtuous officials, and we will eventually have our grievances redressed…." (2) "Director Chen Bozhuang of the Two Road Bureaus convened a meeting of the bureau's staff and made the following statement: 'The truth of the case is clear: the principal offender is Yu Xiangyan. Zhang Hongtu is being held because his wife fled. He will be released once his wife arrives. He is required to return the funds to the public within 48 hours. Yu Xiangyan carried away 80 million yuan in fraudulent funds, and Zhang Hongtu is required to find his wife.' Chief Wang Zhaohuai said, 'Even if Yu Xiangyan cannot be said to be the principal offender, since she and the principal offender Zhang Hongtu are husband and wife, she is naturally one of the principals.'... It seems that what these two officials say and do represents a national institution. Which side should I believe? If I listen to Chief Wang, it seems that, in the eyes of the law, I have not committed a crime. I am merely the wife of a criminal. If I believe Director Chen, the evidence is solid, my wife is the principal offender, and Zhang Hongtu is only suffering for his wife who fled…" The postmark on the letter shows that it was still mailed from this city. It is also learned that after the Road Bureau and Police Department transferred the relevant suspects to the District Procuratorate, the procuratorate discovered that Wang Sanchuan, an employee of the Shanghai materials warehouse of the Materials Department, was also suspected of colluding in the fraud. He was taken into custody. After interrogation, solid evidence was found, and he was sent to the District Procuratorate on the morning of the 9th to be processed together with the other suspects. Rumors that the Road Bureau has discovered a new fraud case are not true.

While in office, the defendant often led puppet special agent teams and Japanese police units to the countryside to requisition military rice. From the 29th to the 22nd day of the first lunar month of last year, he burned down more than 20 houses belonging to villagers such as Yang Shijun in Huangqiao Township because he was unsuccessful in requisitioning military rice. Yang Shijun and Wu Bingzhang, the victims, testified in court yesterday morning. The defendant, who was short in stature and wore glasses, claimed ignorance regarding the burning of civilian houses, but admitted that he had led puppet special agents to the countryside. The court ordered a retrial next week.

### Visiting the Women's Prison

The First Sub-Prison of the Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison is the only women's prison in the city. Usually, it is heavily guarded. Heavy locks are added to the large iron doors one after another, making it impossible for outsiders to enter. Yesterday, the reporter was invited by Warden Di to visit the prison and felt that all the facilities inside could be called a model for Chinese women's prisons.

The prison is divided into five floors. The bottom floor is the office for the staff. The second floor is the prison cells for female traitors. There are currently seven traitors, large and small, imprisoned inside. Among them is She Aizhen, a female traitor known for her mercilessness.

The third floor is the prison cells for ordinary prisoners. The rooms have new-style sanitation equipment, each for six people, with "tatami" mats laid on top. Although the rooms are not large, they are large enough for six people to stretch out and sleep. When the reporter visited, the rooms were empty because the prisoners had gone to the workshop to work. According to the warden, the lives of the prisoners in the prison are very disciplined. Every day from 6:00 AM to 8:00 AM is the time for literacy and exercise. From 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM, they have to do production work for the prison. Therefore, those who stay in the prison cells during the day, apart from the old and weak elderly women, are mothers with babies. It turns out that these people's husbands have died, and they have no relatives at home. They committed crimes (most of them are guilty of selling heroin), and there is no one to take care of the children in their arms. The prison makes special allowances for these prisoners, allowing them to bring their children in, and gives special treatment to these innocent children, allowing them to drink a little milk every day. It is said that two of the babies were born in the prison, and their mothers have been sentenced to eleven years in prison. So, although this child who grew up in prison cannot be said to be out of touch with the world, what difference will there be when he steps out of the prison gate at the age of eleven and sees everything outside that is colorful and dazzling, and the scene of a blind person seeing the light of day again?

A Glimpse of the Dining Hall

There are workshops and dining halls on each floor of the prison. When the reporter approached the dining hall, the prison guard shouted "Stand up" in a solemn tone! The trained prisoners inside put down their work and stood up, their polite expressions touching people and arousing sympathy. When the reporter arrived at the dining hall, it was almost noon, so the prisoners were busy cooking. Rows of freshly cooked tomatoes and greens were placed on the long table, the colors of red and green intertwined, plus the steaming steam, were really tempting! But these beautiful dishes are for the exclusive use of the prison staff. The prisoners' diet is regulated by the prison. There are two meals a day, the first at 9:00 AM in the morning and the second at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. The amount is 20 liang (about three bowls) of white rice per meal, 4 liang of vegetarian dishes, 2 liang of meat (specially delivered by the catering company, choosing the cheaper ones on the vegetable market every day), and 1 qian of oil. Because women have small appetites, these rations are probably not enough to keep them from starving.

A Small Scene in the Workshop

Walking along the dining hall is the workshop. The workshop is divided into three parts. The first room is dedicated to making women's cheongsams and is equipped with two Western-style machines. The second room is dedicated to making prison uniforms, because the prisoners in the prison must wear uniform blue cloth uniforms. Currently, because the prison uniforms are not enough, the prisoners are rushing to make them. The third room is dedicated to knitting wool. Colorful wool threads are piled up on the long table. These are all jobs brought in from the outside. According to the person in charge, these female prisoners are very smart, and they can do very well with just a little guidance. When the reporter stepped into the workshop, there was silence in the room. Rows of neat prisoners were all immersed in their work, and the good order made people admire the authorities' effective management.

Statistics on Female Prisoners

There are a total of 127 prisoners in the Shanghai Women's Prison, most of whom are drug dealers, totaling 79. In addition, there are also cases of murder, robbery, fraud, public morals, obstruction of family, injury, and death. The average age is mostly between 30 and 45 years old. The youngest is 15 years old, and the oldest is 65 years old. There are two foreign prisoners, one Austrian and one Russian, who are accomplices in the same case. The crime they committed is very serious. It is said that they killed a person in a wine shop. One of them is the only one who has been sentenced to death.

### Unbearable to Recall the Film Star - The Tragic and Miserable Yuan Meiyun

Among these prisoners, the most noticeable are the film stars Yuan Meiyun and Xia Peizhen, who are guilty of drug addiction. Xia Peizhen has been suffering from toothache recently, so she is sleeping in the sick ward. When Yuan Meiyun was first admitted, she was often uncomfortable due to stomach problems, but recently she has fully recovered, so her life is very normal. She and Xia Peizhen share a room with a total of six people, all of whom are smokers. According to the sentence, she will be released from prison on October 11, but it is said that she can be released early because, in fact, she is no longer addicted. When the reporter visited, she was sitting quietly knitting wool in the workshop. Her fair skin seemed even fatter than in the movies. From the outside, it was impossible to find a trace of drug use. When the reporter stepped into the workshop, she looked up, with a smile on her face, but when she caught sight of the photographer's camera, she immediately lowered her head. After the first photo was taken, her head was even lower. When the second photo was taken, she even covered her face with a handkerchief and immediately cried. The reporter was initially surprised why Yuan Meiyun was so good at crying, but then she thought, this is no wonder. When the limelight lights up, she will immediately recall her star career that was active under the spotlight in the past. Looking back on the past and looking at the present, it is inevitable to shed a tear of tragic misery!

### Preparing to Host Reporters - Reporting on the Facts

When the reporter asked her about her feelings in prison and her future plans, she refused to answer, saying that she has been in a bad mood recently, and expressed great dissatisfaction with this sentence. She said that after her release, she plans to host reporters on a large scale, report on the facts, and talk about her future work.

According to the warden, Yuan Meiyun's husband, Wang Yin, had visited her in prison, but according to prison rules, prisoners are absolutely not allowed to be visited arbitrarily, so the couple did not meet. However, the warden sympathized with her, so he arranged another time for Wang Yin to come again, but Wang Yin said that since Yuan Meiyun's release date was not far away anyway, it would be better to save this effort to avoid being too emotional with each other. Therefore, they have not met until now.

According to the reporter's investigation: Yuan Meiyun has received the application from the Executive Supervisory Officer Chuan Bang to apply for exemption from the remaining sentence on her behalf. After the presiding judge Shen Tianbao of the District Court rules in the near future, the date of her restoration to freedom will be not far away. (Sacred Heart)

### West Pharmaceutical Factory Under Storms - Notes from Manager Bao of Sinyi Talking About Tablets

Before victory, due to the near-complete cessation of foreign goods and wartime needs, the total number of West pharmaceutical factories in Shanghai reached over 170, and business was generally good. However, today, due to the dumping of foreign drugs and the Chinese people's blind faith in imported goods, only 70 West pharmaceutical factories remain in Shanghai, and most of these 70 are in a state of shutdown or semi-shutdown.

Only a few larger pharmaceutical factories, with more abundant resources and a longer history of production, are still producing day and night and managing to survive. Sinyi Pharmaceutical Factory is one of them.

Sinyi's main factory is on Zhongzheng Middle Road, but the largest factory building is not the main factory but rather Number 20 Masnan Road. In addition, there are also factories at 120 Lujia Road, 914 Beijing Road, 211 Putuo Road, and 670 Linsen Road, all of which are sizable pharmaceutical manufacturing plants. Recently, they also acquired a large factory at 82 Chongming Road, a five-story steel-reinforced concrete building with an area of 150,000 square feet, which was originally the Delerin Apartments. This high-rise building will likely become Sinyi's main factory in the future.

Mechanical Equipment

One of Sinyi's most valuable pieces of machinery is a "compound water distiller," which was shipped from the United States before the Pacific War. It is said to be the latest type of equipment. The distilled water from this type of distiller does not come into contact with the air at all, making it extremely clean. Injections made with this water can avoid all reactions and adverse side effects. In Shanghai, only Sinyi has this excellent equipment.

In addition, they also have single water distillers, air conditioning equipment, rotary tablet presses, new tablet presses, automatic ampule manufacturing machines, and more, a truly well-equipped factory.

Chinese Herbs Prepared with Western Methods

Most Chinese medicinal herbs are plant-based, and they have unique efficacy in medical theory. Unfortunately, the preparation of Chinese medicines is not scientific enough, which reduces their effectiveness. Therefore, there have long been advocates for preparing Chinese herbs with Western methods, and experiments have been conducted. Sinyi has achieved considerable success in preparing Chinese herbs with Western methods. According to factory manager Bao Guochang, to date, Angelica, rhubarb, and Sichuan fritillary bulb have all begun to be prepared using Western methods. Among them, "Quisqualis indica" can replace "Santonin" after Western processing, and its efficacy is stronger than "Santonin." These Western-processed Chinese medicines are not only made into powders and pills, but also into injections. The injection made from the Chinese medicine "raw mountain sliced" is a very good hemostatic and cardiotonic agent.

Various Difficulties

Manager Bao is very right that the dumping of foreign goods is only the beginning. The real massive dumping will occur in 1947. At that time, if we don't have a way to resist, we will feel a hundred times the threat we feel now. Currently, British goods still have limited production, and the needs in various parts of Europe are still very large. The domestic needs in the United States are also very large, so the amount of pharmaceuticals coming to the Chinese market is still limited. By next year, most of their military factories will have been converted into pharmaceutical factories, and all the soldiers will have been demobilized. At that time, our chemical industry will be truly overwhelmed!

Our difficulties are: high labor costs, low production speeds, and raw materials that come from foreign countries, so we cannot compete. For example, the tariff rate for Western pharmaceutical raw materials is 25%, while the tariff rate for finished foreign pharmaceuticals is only 30%. How can our costs compete with theirs?

Moreover, their national banks often lend to pharmaceutical merchants at an interest rate of 1.5%, while our interest rates today are so high. Furthermore, in terms of machinery, the production speed of machinery from 1941 (which we consider to be the latest type) is 40 times slower than the latest machinery today. How can we compete with them?

However, Sinyi Pharmaceutical Factory will increase production in half a year with the same new equipment as the United States today, so the future is not too bleak. However, today, the future of our chemical industry is by no means just a problem for Sinyi alone. This is extremely obvious. (Suo Bei)

### An Interlude in the Rong Case: A Fake Culprit Leads to the Real Culprit - The Mystery of Deng Boyuan Unveiled

[Our Newspaper Report] Details of the capture of some of the main criminals in the Rong Desheng case have been recorded in this newspaper in the past two days. The arrest of the main criminals in the case, Lu Wenqing and Yuan Zhongzhu, benefited greatly from the widespread rumor in the city half a month ago that Deng Boyuan, the main criminal in the Rong case, had been arrested. According to reporters from relevant sources yesterday: Although Deng Boyuan did not participate in the kidnapping of Rong, he is not without indirect relationship to the Rong case. According to the facts, this person is also a figure in the lower class of society. After Mr. Rong was kidnapped, the police made every effort to investigate but had not yet gained any clues, Deng Boyuan suddenly came to inform, claiming that he had obtained some clues about the Rong case and was willing to assist in the investigation. At that time, the relevant authorities gave him some necessary expenses, instructing him to work hard. Unexpectedly, after Deng obtained the money, he not only did not engage in tracking down the Rong case kidnappers, but instead spent his days indulging in a certain "swallow's nest". The police then arrested him. At that time, the person leading the capture was a senior officer of the Garrison Headquarters. A police officer from the Police Bureau assisting at the scene asked whether it was the Rong case, and he vaguely responded in a hurry. The next day, it was widely rumored in the city that Deng Boyuan, the main criminal in the Rong case, had been arrested. In addition, the bandits who kidnapped Rong were divided into three gangs. In addition to Lu Wenqing, the leader of the Shanghai gang, and Yuan Zhongzhu, the leader of the Sheng County gang, who have already been arrested, another gang leader is still being intensively pursued.

[Another Report] The two people arrested by the Police Bureau, Zhan Rongpei and Zheng Liantang, were originally scheduled to be transferred to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters the day before yesterday, but were temporarily postponed due to the discovery of important clues during continued interrogation. It is also learned that several more suspects were arrested yesterday, and the details are still under investigation.

### Tianjin Road Police Officer Fires Gun - Attempting to Stop a Fight Leads to Fatality

[Our Newspaper Report] Cheng Shaorong (65 years old), a street vendor selling scallion pancakes at the intersection of Zhejiang Road and Tianjin Road, employed a worker, Liu Bujin (33 years old from Jiancheng).

The government awards the highest honor of the Soviet Union, the Hero of Labor, and the Stalin Medal to those who have made outstanding contributions to the scientific community." Regarding the situation of scientific research in China, Mr. Hua said that the government should pay attention to ensuring the livelihood of scientists. China's industry and natural science are much behind Western countries.

### Central Industrial College This Year's Enrollment Exam - Provinces Can Recommend Excellent Students

[Dahua News Agency, Chongqing] The Central Industrial College has decided on matters concerning the enrollment of new students this year at a faculty meeting.

It has also sent letters to county middle schools in Sichuan Province, instructing them to recommend outstanding graduating students to study at the school. It has also sent letters to the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities, stating that if there are outstanding graduating students from middle schools in their respective provinces and cities who are interested in industry, they can also be recommended to study at the school.

### Publicly Funded Students in Hubei Province

Summer Vacation Leave Procedures

[Dahua News Agency, Hankou] The Hubei Education Department's method for issuing public funds to publicly funded students who remain in school during this summer vacation is: one-third will be issued in July, none in August, and one-sixth will be issued in September. Publicly funded students who remain in school are deeply worried about this method and have repeatedly petitioned the Education Department to issue funds as before in order to maintain their livelihood. It is now heard that the Education Department has ordered each school to handle the situation with discretion from the remaining funds of the original public funds.

### Secondary School Textbooks: Ministry of Education Hastens Review

Reducing Circulation of Erroneous Texts

[Ta Hua News Agency, Nanjing] Previously, for subjects in primary and secondary schools for which the Ministry of Education did not compile national textbooks, such as elementary school manual arts, drawing, singing and games, and secondary school English, mathematics, physics and chemistry, zoology and botany, mineralogy, physiology, hygiene, music, physical education, manual arts, home economics, and Boy Scouts, the Ministry of Education revised the curriculum standards between 1941 and 1942. These new standards differed significantly from the old standards of 1937. There was an urgent need to publish an authorized version of the new standards to coordinate with the national textbooks based on the new standards and facilitate teaching. This would embody the true meaning of "national textbooks and authorized textbooks being used concurrently." However, the number of textbooks compiled and submitted for review by various bookstores according to the new standards has been scarce. Those already submitted to the Ministry are being reviewed as quickly as possible to reduce the circulation of erroneous texts. Furthermore, according to Ministry of Education regulations, the National Institute for Compilation and Translation is the competent authority for textbook review. Current employees of the institute are prohibited from serving as chief editors or compilers of primary and secondary school textbooks for bookstores during their tenure to prevent corruption. Recently, the institute will thoroughly enforce this prohibition, and all textbook editing contracts between employees and bookstores will be declared invalid.

Those who pass the final examinations will be assigned to various universities for further study. In addition, after the deadline for registration for government-funded and self-funded overseas students handled by the Municipal Bureau of Education, registration for government-funded overseas study for Youth Army soldiers continues. However, only just over fifty Youth Army soldiers have registered so far, indicating a lack of enthusiasm. The registration deadline will be July 13th.

### Encouraging Service in the Navy

Another report: Among the demobilized Youth Army soldiers, many aspire to join the Navy.

### Ministry of Education Orders National Schools to Give Priority Admission to Children of War-Dead Soldiers: Public Schools Provide Free Education, Private Schools Also Give Priority to Free Quotas

[Our newspaper report, Nanjing] Instruction No. 4525 from the Ministry of Education, addressed to the education departments and bureaus of all provinces and cities, states: "During the eight years of war, we were fortunate to have the loyal and brave soldiers of the nation fight valiantly and selflessly, ultimately achieving final victory. Now, in this time of postwar reconstruction, education comes first. The children of soldiers who died in the war have fulfilled their duty to the nation, and if they are orphaned and without support, they should be given preferential treatment with free education to nurture them and comfort the souls of the fallen. It is hereby stipulated that, from this year onwards, all levels of public schools nationwide, whether enrolling new students or transfer students, shall give priority to admission and enrollment for children of soldiers who died in the war who hold certificates and apply for examination. After admission, they may apply for free education in accordance with the regulations for free education for the children of war heroes. The application shall be submitted by the schools to the competent education administrative authorities for approval. The competent education administrative authorities at all levels should also allocate a special allowance within their respective financial budgets, in accordance with the regulations for free education for the children of war heroes, to facilitate the reimbursement of expenses. According to regulations, applications for free education for such expenses are limited to public schools. However, if the children of soldiers who died in the war voluntarily enroll in private schools and those private schools have free quotas, they may apply for priority. Please comply with these instructions and implement them accordingly." (Bai)

### Public Grain for Elementary School Teachers: All Converted to Cash Payments

Executive Yuan Orders Ministry of Education to Comply

[Our newspaper report, Nanjing] Public grain for elementary school teachers was originally provided from 30% of the land tax collected in each county. After the victory in the War of Resistance, land taxes in various provinces were exempted, and the co-collection was simultaneously halted, severing the source of public grain for elementary school teachers. In view of this situation, the Ministry of Education submitted a request to the Executive Yuan for relief. Recently, an order was received that public grain for elementary school teachers should be converted to cash payments. The methods are as follows: (1) In provinces where land taxes have been exempted, the central government will allocate a subsidy equal to 30% of the county tax based on the original actual collection amount in each province, and the employees' salaries will be supplemented by the county government by incorporating the original public grain portion into the living allowance. (2) In provinces where land taxes have not been exempted, the county government will still co-collect 30% of the land tax, and the county government will sell the original in-kind items at the local market price and incorporate the proceeds into the living allowance. (Lin)

### Dr. Minsed Flies to Guangzhou to Discuss Merger with Lingnan University

[Our newspaper report] Dr. Minsed, Executive Director of the United Board for Christian Colleges in China, is scheduled to fly to Guangzhou today to discuss merger plans with the Board of Directors of Lingnan University. According to reports, this trip will take about four or five days.

Then, he will return from Chengdu to Wuhan, and from Wuhan, he will fly to Beiping to deal with Yenching University.

Church University Merger Plan

Dr. Minsed went on to discuss the merger plan, stating: "According to the plan, with the exception of Shanghai, Nanjing, and Fuzhou, only one university will remain in each of the cities of Beiping, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Wuhan, and Chongqing. Each university will become a part of a 'United University,' and their departments will not duplicate each other. Research institutes will be established in Beiping, Shanghai, and Nanjing so that graduates can obtain doctoral degrees. According to the original plan, the four Christian universities in Shanghai will merge into one East China University."

Zhejiang University and Soochow University Accept Recommendations

Currently, Zhejiang University and Soochow University have accepted the merger recommendations. Shanghai University is not planning to participate for the time being, and St. John's University has not yet decided and is awaiting discussion by the board of directors. Dr. Minsed repeatedly emphasized that this plan is merely a suggestion, and the final decision to accept or reject it rests with the university authorities. However, in terms of saving manpower and resources and raising the standard of culture and scholarship, this merger plan is extremely valuable.

### Shanghai's Famous Football Goalkeeper Tan Degao Flies to Hong Kong This Weekend

Teerpalka Changes His Name and Joins the Chinese Nationality; Will Go to Hong Kong to Join the Eastern Star Expedition Team

When the Hong Kong Eastern Star Football Team visited Shanghai for matches, there was enthusiastic publicity about their planned expedition to Australia. To increase their strength, they specially scouted for outstanding players in Shanghai to join the team and strengthen their ranks. At that time, in addition to several Chinese players from this city, Teerpalka, an Italian goalkeeper, was also invited to join. Mr. Qu Yaokang, an enthusiast of sports, was entrusted to handle the procedures for Teerpalka to change his nationality to Chinese and rename himself Tan Degao. However, Teerpalka declined due to the fact the trip to Australia would take two months, and it would be hard to obtain a long leave from his service at the U.S. Army Headquarters.

Unexpectedly, after the Eastern Star team returned to Hong Kong, there was no further news. Tan Degao's livelihood became a problem. He consulted Mr. Qu Yaokang, who, believing that the Eastern Star team needed talented players, decided to accompany Tan Degao to Hong Kong this weekend so that he could formally join the team and participate in the expedition. If the plane ticket cannot be purchased, the departure will be postponed by one week.

Civil Affairs Briefs

### Methods for Appointment, Dismissal, and Transfer of District and Bao Staff: District Offices May Not Alter Without Authorization

Since the establishment of autonomous organizations at all levels, changes in personnel at district offices and Bao-Jia have been frequent, and personnel matters have been inconsistent. This is sufficient to affect the progress of autonomous undertakings. To establish the personnel foundation of autonomous organizations at all levels, the municipal government has specifically stipulated the following four methods for the appointment, dismissal, and transfer of district and Bao staff in the future:

(1) The transfer of personnel at all levels, whether it be removal, resignation, transfer, promotion, or demotion, must first be reported to the municipal government for approval. District offices may not alter without authorization. (2) The appointment of commissioned personnel must be approved before they can be appointed. They must not be dispatched and assigned to their posts by the district office in advance. (3) If there are mistakes made by staff at all levels and if there is no major error or illegal and corrupt activity, they may only be given reprimands or demerits as punishment. They should not be easily dismissed or transferred for minor offenses to stabilize their work. (4) If the staff of district offices and Bao cadres are unsuitable for the current environment, the district office may request their transfer. The above four items have been issued for compliance.

Another report: The municipal government has recently tended to emphasize academic qualifications and experience when appointing staff at all levels, often neglecting general physical conditions. As a result, those who are weak, sick, and elderly and unable to handle their duties may be fortunate enough to be appointed, which greatly affects work efficiency. Therefore, it has formulated ten methods for physical examinations of employees to select personnel. The above methods were sent out yesterday with an order for all agencies to comply.

### Dock Warehouse Congestion: Twenty Ships Berth Daily, Daily Losses Exceeding 100 Million Yuan

"Reported by this newspaper" According to Liu Nianzhi, General Manager of China Wharf Company, recently, the various docks and warehouses in this city have seen some improvement in congestion due to the gradual clearance of large quantities of enemy and puppet goods, the continuous vacating of docks by the U.S. military, and the active promotion of dredging work by the Bureau of Hydraulic Engineering. However, the materials stockpiled by government and relief agencies remain considerable, often remaining untouched for months. The warehouse space is completely occupied. As a result, the goods carried by incoming ships cannot be unloaded upon arrival, resulting in an average of twenty ships being detained in the port each day. The detention time often reaches two weeks. On average, each ship spends 3,000 US dollars per day due to detention. Therefore, with twenty ships, the unnecessary loss reaches over 100 million legal tender per day. This loss, directly or indirectly, is passed on to the government and the people. Therefore, Mr. Liu suggests that in order to develop Shanghai's foreign trade and prosper Shanghai's port, the berthing and stacking of goods in dock warehouses should be fluid. The time should be short so that goods can flow smoothly. In terms of construction, efforts should be made to mechanize Shanghai's dock warehouses, using more machinery to replace manual labor. This can save labor costs and simplify work. Mr. Liu hopes that the government will quickly utilize or sell to various docks the machinery suitable for docks from the surplus materials of the U.S. military that it has acquired. It is estimated that the use of machinery can save at least five to ten times the current labor costs. Mr. Liu also mentioned the recent prevalence of theft in dock warehouses. It is reported that this large-scale theft is highly organized. When foreign ships arrive at the port, the crew often colludes with the stevedores to carry out theft in the hold. When lightering goods into the river, small sampans (commonly known as "water rats") gather and steal goods in batches. In addition, when goods are loaded and unloaded at the docks, there are many stevedores going in and out, making prevention even more difficult. Mr. Liu specifically pointed out that because these thefts are organized, the police bureau, water police, shipping companies, and the competent authorities of various dock warehouses should cooperate and discuss practical and effective prevention measures. Whether in the ship's hold or at the dock warehouse, supervisors should be dispatched to closely monitor when goods are loaded and unloaded. Reward and punishment rules should also be established to improve work efficiency.

### After the Price of White Rice Increased: North and South Markets Eagerly Receive Rice, Rice Shops Refuse to Sell Subsidized Brown Rice

The Grain Price Review Committee held its third meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Qu Zhenhua, Zhang Xichao, Yang Jiuci, and others attended, presided over by Ji Mingzhai of the Grain Section of the Social Affairs Bureau. The resolution on yesterday's white rice prices was in accordance with the prices agreed upon the day before. Since the meeting set the prices for various types of white rice the day before yesterday, transactions in the North and South rice markets have become active. The North market received 4,080 dan of rice, and the South market received 1,851 dan, totaling 5,921 dan. The retail price should not exceed 71,000 yuan.

[Another report] In order to take care of the rice needs of the general poor citizens, the municipal authorities planned to continue distributing 5,000 bags of brown rice each for the past two days, and hand them over to rice shops to sell at subsidized prices, but the rice shops refused to accept and sell them. Now the authorities have ordered several rice shops designated by the district offices to sell subsidized rice, which will be implemented in the coming days.

The Shanghai General Warehouse of the Ministry of Food has allocated 50,000 dan of rice to the municipal government. It is reported that the last batch of 500 tons was transported to the port by the China Merchants Bureau's Iron Barge No. 560 yesterday morning. After delivery, all 50,000 dan of rice were delivered.

[Another report] Of the 20 U.S. landing craft received by the China Merchants Bureau, five have been allocated to the Minsheng Company for takeover and are currently being refitted. According to Director Ye of the General Grain Warehouse, these landing craft are specifically for transporting rice, and each can load 200 to 300 tons of rice.

### Many Rumors in the Black Market: Public Bond Prices Surge Again

The public bond market has rekindled. There were rumors in the market yesterday that the principal would be repaid in silver coins and that many brokerage companies were organizing, leading to a buying spree. With the encouragement of a few brokers, buyers participated enthusiastically. "Tong Bing" bonds rose from 800 yuan in the morning to 1,200 yuan, and then slightly stabilized. Two major players on the fifth and seventh floors covered their short positions. As a result, the closing price rose by 320 yuan compared to the previous day. Class A and B bonds rose by 200 yuan, Class D bonds rose by 290, and Class E bonds rose by 350 yuan alone.

### Active Coal Market Transactions

Yesterday, the coal market saw increased purchases from customers after a long period of rain. Transactions among peers were also active. Due to the high cost of capital and long transportation times, it was still difficult for those who handled white coal screenings to obtain substantial profits. Therefore, arrivals were still low, and the market price suddenly rose sharply. The market prices for bituminous coal lumps and coal dust still diverged. Due to the shortage of lump coal and the severe loss of gangue, the asking price was high. The price of coal seam in Pudong, two-layer stack, was a new low of 145,000 yuan.

### Crossing Out Promissory Notes and Bills of Exchange: No Legal Effect

Recently Instructed by the Ministry of Finance

If a check has parallel lines or special parallel lines (i.e., specifying a certain bank within the parallel lines), it can only be paid to money dealers or specified money dealers, as stipulated in Article 134 of the Negotiable Instruments Law. In other words, a crossed check can only be collected by a bank or money shop, and a specially crossed check can only be collected by the designated bank or money shop. Recently, according to custom, parallel lines and special parallel lines have also been added to promissory notes and bills of exchange, believing that the effect is the same as a check. However, this is not the case. The Joint Treasury has previously sent a letter to the Ministry of Finance for verification, which has now been received, stating: "According to civil law, matters not stipulated by law shall be governed by custom. Article 9 of the Negotiable Instruments Law has mandatory provisions: 'Matters not stipulated by the Negotiable Instruments Law recorded on a negotiable instrument shall not have the effect of a negotiable instrument.' Therefore, parallel lines drawn on promissory notes and bills of exchange shall not have the effect stipulated for checks in Article 134 of the Negotiable Instruments Law." This reply is based on the Interpretation No. 2830 of the Judicial Yuan.

### Few Buyers in the Yarn Market: Mosquito Netting Made of Raw Cotton is Very Popular

Yesterday, the yarn market improved slightly. Customers from Tianjin and Guangdong remained inactive, but the Yangtze River Road and the Jingwu Railway Line took advantage of low prices to purchase yarn. Although the amount was not large, it added some color to the market. Sentiment among peers remained weak, and factories were willing to sell off, but there were few buyers, and the trend still showed no signs of significant recovery. At noon, the Textile Construction Company opened the yarn market as usual, with prices similar to the previous period, but 32-count Xiantao cone yarn was marked down by 20,000 yuan.

Yesterday, New York's American cotton futures rose by 48 to 51 points per pound. The near-term price was 32.53, the far-term price was 32.79, and the Middling spot price was 33.22, all of which were unprecedented highs. The local raw cotton market remained stable, and transactions remained smooth. State-owned yarn mills such as Tongyi, Dufeng, Jiafeng, Xinsheng, and Qingchang all made purchases, and transactions among cotton dealers were also lively. Some cotton dealers exchanged yarn from Xinsheng Yarn Mill for Middling cotton at a rate of 11.5 dans per dan.

### Enthusiastic Applications for Brokers: Securities Exchange Actively Renovating

[Reported by this newspaper] Since the Shanghai Securities Market Preparatory Committee began processing broker applications on the 9th, it has issued more than 1,000 application forms as of yesterday, indicating widespread enthusiasm for applications. It is reported that the interior of the Securities Market has also been actively recruiting workers and contractors to build two separate markets for securities and bonds. The tenants on the second and third floors of the Securities Exchange Building have been asked to move to the vacant space vacated by Guanghua University on the eighth floor of the same building. At the same time, an agreement has been reached with the Shanghai Telephone Company to install 300 telephones in each market. However, all lines must be moved from the telephone line station in the Baxianqiao District of the company, so even if workers rush to install day and night, it will take at least four weeks. The complete renovation of the market will take at least one month.

### Flat Sales of Cotton Cloth

The cloth market was unusually sluggish. Actual sales from customers were flat. In addition, the yarn market was trending downwards, causing the related cloth to be affected. Grey cloth and bleached cloth fell by 500 yuan to 750 yuan. Twill was stable, but colored balls were being sought in the North, rising by 1,000 yuan alone. Everything else remained in a soft position.

### No Improvement in Foreign Tea Market

In the foreign tea market, the trading was difficult to conclude due to the price suppression of Chen Zhenmei by Xiehe Foreign Company, Xinhua, Wang Yutai, and others. However, various tea companies, considering the relatively suitable selling price of Wuyuan Chenchou Tribute tea, were quite happy to continue absorbing it. As for the new export teas that have been traded back and forth in recent days, the negotiations between the two sides still have a huge gap, and the situation has not improved. Although the Jiangbei and Tianjin gangs rarely purchase various domestic sales varieties, there are many additions from the Susong and local street shops, resulting in a stable market situation, with prices varying slightly depending on the quality of the goods.

### Re-establishment, Construction, Military Needs: Three Types of Government Bonds Drawn by Lottery Yesterday: Total Principal Repaid 10.22 Million Yuan

[Reported by this newspaper] The Public Debt Department of the Ministry of Finance held the lottery drawing for the repayment of principal for three types of government bonds, including Re-establishment, Construction, and Military Needs, at 9:00 AM yesterday at its Shanghai office. Chen Bingzhang, Director of the Public Debt Department, Ge Jiecun of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Mao Xikang of the Audit Department, Yang Samo of the Bankers Association, Xu Junqing of the Central Bank, Mei Shaocheng of the Bank of China, Zhang Yu of the Bank of Communications, Cao Boquan of the Money Dealers Association, and others attended. First, Chen Bingzhang, Director of the Public Debt Department, reported on the process of the lottery drawing for the repayment of principal for the three types of government bonds. The Re-establishment Government Bonds of 1936 (Republic Year 25) were being repaid for the 21st time, and 18 tickets were to be drawn, with the winning tickets totaling 6.12 million yuan. The second phase of the Construction Government Bonds of 1939 (Republic Year 28) were being repaid for the 10th time, and 7 tickets were to be drawn, with the winning tickets totaling 2.1 million yuan. The first phase of the Military Needs Government Bonds of 1941 (Republic Year 30) were being repaid for the 7th time, and 5 tickets were to be drawn, with the winning tickets totaling 2 million yuan. The supervisors were then invited to inspect the ticket tubes, number tickets, and ticket ledgers. The lottery drawers then performed the lottery drawing. The winning numbers were: Re-establishment Government Bonds: 009, 063, 154, 260, 296, 317, 328, 401, 458, 577, 588, 688, 692, 738, 846, 898, 927, 942; second phase of the Construction Government Bonds: 077, 203, 351, 439, 556, 751, 962; first phase of the Military Needs Government Bonds: 119, 387, 698, 854, 901.

Chen Bingzhang, Director of the Public Debt Department, also told reporters that the payment deadline for the repayment of principal and matured interest coupons for various government bonds was originally set at three years. In order to protect the rights and interests of bondholders in the occupied and remote areas during the eight-year war of resistance, the government has specifically stipulated that from July 1 of this year to the end of this year, all outstanding repayments of principal and matured interest coupons for various government bonds can still be collected from the Four Banks and Two Bureaus or their agent treasuries.

### Need to Settle Import Goods: U.S. Dollars and Hong Kong Notes Surge Again: Gold Prices Rise to Over 30,000

Yesterday, foreign exchange remained stable. It opened high in the morning due to the rumor of coinage, but securities firms selling gold to exchange for shares caused it to fall from around 1.94 million. The Central Bank allocated 140 bars at a price of 1.925 million, which was similar to the market price at the time. After that, it fluctuated between 1.92 million and 1.93 million. In the afternoon, a large amount of buying came from U.S. dollars, pushing it back up to around 1.95 million. As a result, the closing price rose by over 30,000 compared to the previous day. Ornamental gold was 10,800, silver was 1,800, the underground money market eased again, and interest rates were about 1.5 to 1.8 corners.

The U.S. dollar was quite stable. It opened flat in the morning and remained very stable after opening. Settlement was more active. Although it retreated from 2,480 yuan to 2,440 yuan, it was only temporary. Soon it gradually rose, hovering around 2,480 yuan at noon. With ships arriving one after another, settlement was even more active. In the afternoon, it approached the 2,600 yuan level again before leveling off slightly. As a result, the closing price rose by 180 compared to the previous day. Hedging squeezed closer to 756 yuan per 10 taels. The Hong Kong note market actually exceeded the telegraphic transfer price in the afternoon, surging by 20 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate rose along with the note market to 540 yuan, the Indian exchange rate was 650 yuan, the British exchange rate was 8,600, and the U.S. exchange rate remained flat.

### White and Brown Sugar Both Fall

Yesterday, the sugar market softened again due to a wait-and-see attitude towards actual sales. The association's marked price for No. 20 medium-grade white sugar was initially 100,450 yuan, then 4,500 yuan, then 4,000 yuan, and finally 2,000 yuan, a drop of 45,000 yuan. Stacking orders available today are 98,000 yuan. Raw brown sugar was slightly tighter due to a shortage of goods, at 100,200 yuan. Green sugar was increasingly weak due to oversupply. The Chao Gang opened dozens of bags of Huanggang green sugar at a price of 81,200 yuan, another drop of 1,000 yuan.

The sixth phase of the Taiwan Sugar Company's auction is scheduled to be held tomorrow. The selling price is under consideration. In three or four days, the "Hai Gui Wheel" will arrive in Shanghai from Taiwan, bringing a large batch of Taiwan sugar.

### Food Company

Must First Go Through Company Procedures, Then Obtain Food Department License

[Reported by this newspaper] The Ministry of Food recently stipulated that all food firms organized as companies must first go through the registration procedures in accordance with the Company Law and obtain the registration documents from the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Then, they must submit these documents along with the company's articles of association, business plan, list of directors and supervisors, and food merchant registration form to the Ministry of Food for issuance of a food merchant license before they are allowed to operate. It is reported that this has been communicated to all provinces and cities for compliance.

### Counterfeit Money Discovered in Various Places

Recently, it has been discovered in various places along the Jinghu and Huhang lines that the Central Bank's 50-yuan notes printed by Delarue Company in 1941 (Republic Year 30) have been altered to 500 yuan. These altered notes involve pasting another piece of paper over the original "50" characters to change them to "500". Also, counterfeit banknotes of the Central Bank's blue 2,000-yuan version have been discovered. These counterfeit notes are exquisitely printed, and it is difficult to distinguish the paper quality and printing ink from the real ones. Only through close comparison can they be identified as counterfeit. The differences are that the lines of the portrait of Sun Yat-sen on the front are uneven in thickness, and the ink color is slightly blurred. The five characters "Central Printing Factory" printed on the lower center edge are blurred, especially the three characters "Printing Factory", which are quite unclear due to the many strokes. The pen strokes of the director's signature on the back are also slightly thicker than those of the genuine banknotes. The Ministry of Finance has already issued notices to the provincial and municipal governments based on reports from various parties, ordering their subordinates to pay attention to the investigation and prosecution in accordance with the law.

### Hot Trading Concentrated in Chinese Stocks

But High Prices Could Not Be Sustained, Resulting in Slight Gains

Chinese stocks were stimulated by rumors when the market opened yesterday morning, appearing to be hot. The financial strength of the industry was limited, so they could only concentrate their efforts on the most popular stocks, leaving them with no time to attend to the less popular ones. There were sellers, and small stocks soon fell back down. High prices for large stocks were also difficult to sustain, but they were still seeing-sawing at noon. Small stocks all saw lower prices. When they were most popular in the middle of the day, Yongshen was as high as 473 yuan, Maya was 2,900 yuan, Jingfu was 195 yuan, Xinguang was 220 yuan, and Qinxing was 173 yuan. By noon, the results were that Yongshen and Maya had risen slightly, while Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing had all fallen by more than half a percent. Small and medium-sized cold stocks continued to decline slightly. Selling pressure on old stocks was high, making them difficult to sell off, and the decline was greater.

Yesterday, the major popular stocks in the foreign stock market were unable to rise, remaining relatively flat. Smaller stocks varied according to supply and demand, with some still being liquidated in large quantities, showing more declines than gains. The overall trend fluctuated, but by noon, Yishen and British Union were flat compared to the previous day, while Huide, Sichuan Yibei, and others rose slightly. Paper industry, steel industry, Asian industry, and Guangzhou industry all fell slightly.

### Yellow and White Printing Paper Arrive in Shanghai

Product of Taiwan Paper Company

The Zhaoshang Bureau's Hai Chen Wheel, carrying white and yellow printing paper from Taiwan, unloaded its cargo in Pudong yesterday morning. This printing paper is a product of the Taiwan Paper Company. The company uses its own forests to make pulp and paper, making it the largest paper-making institution in the country. It is reported that part of this shipment will be transshipped to various ports in the interior, with only a small amount being supplied to local manufacturers in Shanghai. It is expected that it will be regularly shipped to Shanghai in the future.

### U.S. Gold Reserves Total Over 20 Billion U.S. Dollars

[United Press, Washington, 9th] It has been reported that U.S. gold reserves, which sharply decreased during the war, are now gradually increasing again. According to the Treasury Department, the current U.S. gold reserves are valued at approximately $20,270,000,000. The highest record in the past was October 1941, when gold reserves reached a value of $22,799,700,000.

### U.S. Spice Market: Chinese Goods Rank First

[Reuters, New York, 10th] According to the American Spice Trade Association: Recently, seven sources of spices, the markets of which have been reopened, have been counted. The most important of these should be China. Normally, the amount of spices China exports to the United States is second only to India and the Dutch East Indies. The seven reopened source countries are listed below: China...cinnamon, fennel, cassia; Argentina...poppy seeds; Haiti...Tonka beans; Cyprus...aniseed, fennel, cassia; Greece...basil, mint, cassia; Yugoslavia...pepper, basil; Sweden...mustard, poppy.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Grains: Flour was firm in the morning but weak in the afternoon. Shandong wheat was slightly inquired about, but the rate of consumption was still slow. Yellow beans were high in price, then weakened. The soybean cake market was flat and weak. Oil prices remained lackluster. Bran continued to decline by 200 yuan.

Hardware: A large batch of grinding wheels ordered by Tongyi Foreign Company before the war has arrived. At the same time, a large number of Ace Brand files from Asia Steel Plate Foreign Company have also arrived. Prices will remain unchanged for the time being. It is reported that those who own the goods want to sell them off at low prices due to tight credit conditions.

Tung Oil: [United Press, Washington, 9th] It was learned here today that China is gradually restoring its position as a tung oil exporting country. In the first three months of this year, 1.5 million pounds of tung oil were shipped to the United States. However, due to transportation difficulties, it is difficult to see an increase for the time being.

Dried Lily Flowers: Recently, dried lily flowers have been arriving one after another, but sales have been very slow. In addition, the new goods are softer in quality and cannot be stored for long. The only option is to sell them off cheaply, which has led to repeated price declines. Dozens of bags were traded in the market yesterday, falling another 30% or so. The total decline has reached 40%, indicating that the weakness has reached an extreme point.

Diesel: China Oil Factory's diesel exports amounted to 3,800 tons last month, worth US$3 million. 90% was shipped to the United States, and the remaining 10% was shipped to the Soviet Union. It is generally speculated that this month will decrease to around 1,500 tons due to transportation disruptions in the production areas.

### Commemorating Lugou Bridge

— Special Correspondent Zhang Jianmei, Beiping Correspondence, July 5th

Nine Years Have Passed, Yet the Scars Remain Fresh

On July 2nd, several colleagues from Beiping visited Lugou Bridge with the reverence one might have for a hallowed site of the War of Resistance.

Lugou Bridge is located thirty *li* southwest of Beiping, connected closely by a smooth asphalt road built by the Japanese. After passing through Zhangyi Gate and undergoing an inspection, our car headed west. Apart from the yellow blockhouses scattered like stars outside of arrow range, the highway exuded an atmosphere of bustling peace. Farmers' large carts transporting grain and vendors carrying gourds and fruits plodded north, supplying Beiping with sustenance. The wheat on both sides had already been harvested, but due to lack of rain, autumn crops had not yet been planted, leaving most of the land bare.

In less than half an hour, we had reached Wanping territory. This city was truly the starting point of the war. On July 6th, nine years prior, the Mutaguchi Regiment wanted to pass through the city to conduct exercises south of the Yongnan River. The defending national army refused them passage. Using the excuse that two soldiers were missing during exercises on the other side of the Yongding River on July 5th, they insisted on entering the city to search, but were still refused by the defending army. The next day at dawn, the Mutaguchi Regiment launched the July 7th Incident, which shook the world. Although nine years have passed, the scars inflicted on Wanping by the invaders remain fresh. The city walls on both sides of the north gate were riddled with bullet holes, and the Japanese later filled the damaged areas with new bricks. However, the new bricks, juxtaposed against the dark, ancient city walls, fully displayed the trauma and discord. Wanping City was originally small, with a diameter of only one *li* from north to south. The houses within the city, destroyed by shelling nine years ago, have not been repaired to this day, leaving ruins of broken tiles, collapsed walls, shattered bricks, and rotten wood everywhere. Giant weeds grow on the ground, and eagles and crows circle in the sky. Besides the garrison, few people remain in the city. The Wanping County government, perhaps unable to endure the loneliness of the desolate city or unable to supply the passing troops, simply moved to Xindian. Now, only the Lugou Bridge Township Office remains in the city.

One of the Ten Scenic Spots of the Northern Kingdom: Lugou at Dawn

Lugou Bridge, visited by Marco Polo, is located less than a hundred meters from the south gate of Wanping. It is a stone bridge about forty meters long and three meters wide, majestically spanning the vast, yellow Yongding River. Construction began in the twenty-ninth year of the Dading reign of the Jin Dynasty and lasted four years, making it exquisitely built. Each balustrade is carved with a lion about a foot tall, with many small lions squatting at the feet of each large lion. A melon vendor on the bridge said, "The number of large lions is known, but the number of small lions is unknown." In the seven hundred and fifty-seven years since, dynastic changes, wars, and wind and rain seem not to have inflicted much damage. Only three of the hundreds of small lions have had parts of their heads chipped off.

At the northern end of the bridge stands a stele inscribed with "Lugou at Dawn," said to be one of the ten scenic spots of Beijing. Presumably, watching the setting dawn moon over the Yongding River from the bridge is uniquely charming, but unfortunately, we arrived too late. Directly across from Lugou Bridge is the Pinghan Railway Bridge to the west, a long and beautiful black iron bridge over one hundred and fifty meters long, also spanning the Yongding River. It is modern enough, but we still prefer the ancient Lugou Bridge, not just because of the beauty of "Lugou at Dawn" and the nostalgic sentiments evoked by the sound of camel bells crossing the bridge, but because it is the starting point of our great War of Resistance. When the Pinghan Railway's Yongding River Bridge was taken after the July 7th Incident, this ancient bridge remained impregnable in the hands of our 29th Army brothers wielding broadswords, until the national army withdrew from Beiping on July 30th, when the troops guarding the bridge automatically retreated.

The Once-Illustrious Monument, Now Trapped in the Mud

The Japanese army fired the first shot at our army from the Yiwenzishan hills west of Wanping City. Therefore, the Japanese also considered this place to be the "birthplace" of their invasion of China. In a field of gravel, besides a few white, dilapidated houses with missing doors and windows, the reporter could find almost nothing. Finally, on a small earthen hill, we found the pitiful monument, pushed over and lying awkwardly on the hillside. The monument was made of white stone, with the main text:

"Yiwenzishan, the Place Where the China Incident Began." The other side stated: "July 8th, Showa 12 [1937]. Mutaguchi Unit from the 29th to the 2nd, Battlefield Fierce Battle with Noguchi Cavalry Unit on the 28th. Merit" (indicating that this was the battlefield of the Mutaguchi Regiment and the Noguchi Cavalry Unit). The four sides of the base of the monument were also engraved with the words "First Anniversary of the Outbreak of the China Incident, Day, Square, Beijing Residents' Association." and described the construction process: "Because the characters on the two sides of the stele were written by Mr. Hachi, two wooden markers were placed at this location, written by the Mutaguchi Unit Commander. Copied and engraved." (indicating that the characters on the monument were engraved based on the handwriting on the wooden signs of the Mutaguchi Unit Commander). Finally, the date of the monument's erection was noted: "July 7th, Showa 13 [1938], North China Branch of the Imperial Veterans Association." Perhaps those people from the Mutaguchi Regiment and the Noguchi Cavalry Unit have become cannon fodder or war criminals today. The once-illustrious "monument" has also been pushed over and lies prostrate in the mud.

A General from Xuzhou Selects a Burial Place for Loyal Bones

On the other hand, General He Jifeng, the commander of the 119th Brigade who led the Lugou Bridge garrison during the July 7th Incident—now the Deputy Commander of the Third Pacification Zone in the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters—walked among the hills of Yiwenzishan with Huang Rencai, the Special Commissioner of the Fifth District of Hebei, in the capacity of a victor, to commemorate this battlefield. General He had just flown in from Xuzhou. His main task this time was to find a final resting place on Yiwenzishan for General Zhao Dengyu, who died in the Battle of Nanyuan nine years ago. General Zhao's remains are currently temporarily placed in a temple in Beiping. General He and some old friends have petitioned for a state funeral for General Zhao.

### Acting as a Bridge Between the US and the Soviet Union: Establishing a Century-Long Plan for World Peace—On the International Situation and Diplomatic Policy—

— Chu Yukun

(1)

Under the current international circumstances, "All Under Heaven Are One Family" is still an ideal, and there is still a considerable distance from its realization. Therefore, any country or nation that wishes to survive in this world must have the power to defend itself. As everyone knows, there are two types of power that protect a country's survival: one is tangible military force, which is the country's military strength; the other is intangible intelligence, which is the country's diplomacy. In times of war, it is of course necessary to rely on strong military equipment to fight for victory on the battlefield. However, relying solely on force and failing to use intelligence, with diplomacy as a precursor to military action, is not enough to ensure survival. The result of this world war, in which the militaristic Germany and Japan were utterly defeated, is a good example. Conversely, if military and diplomacy can be equally emphasized, with diplomacy as the vanguard of military action on the one hand, and military strength as the backing of diplomacy on the other, then success is assured. In this war, although Britain's military strength was not as great as that of Nazi Germany, it was able to turn defeat into victory, which can be said to be entirely due to Churchill's diplomatic success.

As for peacetime, both military preparedness and diplomacy are matters of utmost concern to all countries. The United States, for example, not only wants to keep the secret of atomic energy, but also wants to extend the conscription law, so that its army, navy, and air force maintain wartime levels. Recently, the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps conducted atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll to determine the power of atomic bombs against the navy. At the same time, the United States is making various diplomatic offensives, not only to make the United Nations a unique and effective tool for maintaining world peace, but also to launch various international conferences and propose international treaties to stabilize the post-war world and prevent it from being threatened by war. Why does the United States do this? To put it in broader terms, this is what the United States must do for international peace and world security; to put it in narrower terms, this is for the sake of its own security and prosperity. Because no American does not believe that "if other countries in the world are destroyed by war or internal strife, or threatened by famine, poverty, and disease, then the United States cannot enjoy peace and prosperity within its own borders."

As for the Soviet Union, it is a socialist country, and both in thought and in theory, it forms a separate system, completely different from the capitalist countries of Britain and the United States. Having suffered painful lessons in this war, it has to pay special attention to the two forces that protect its own survival. Therefore, in the post-war Soviet Union, in addition to burying itself in material construction and strengthening the power of the armed forces, it is also committed to diplomacy, wanting to make its surrounding neighbors its "safe zone."

Therefore, in peacetime international relations, both "military competition" and the diplomatic war of "seeking security" are unavoidable.

Looking back at our country, we have always regarded "World Harmony" as our ideal and collective security as our means. However, estimating the power to protect our country's survival is chilling. First, in terms of military preparedness: today's world has entered the atomic age, but our industrialization period has not yet matured. Since industry cannot be industrialized, the so-called military preparedness has no foundation. Whether it is the army, navy, or air force, we are lagging behind and cannot catch up. It is obviously insufficient to protect our own survival by force. Secondly, in terms of diplomacy, China's post-war diplomacy is again hovering on the divergent paths of Washington and Moscow. In addition, our own strength is insufficient, and relying on collective security and the United Nations is reliable but not for long. Therefore, today's China, whether in terms of military preparation or diplomacy, is not enough to protect its own survival. Therefore, we must raise our vigilance, pay attention to the evolution of the international situation at all times, and re-examine our country's established diplomatic policy.

(2)

Our country fought a hard-fought war of resistance for eight years. Although the material conditions were not as good as those of the enemy, we finally won. This cannot but be said to be the success of our country's diplomacy. Because when our country launched a full-scale war of resistance, the international situation was not entirely favorable to our country, but our country's highest authorities, having insight into the domestic and international situation, resolutely decided on five principles:

(1) To maintain the spirit of independence and autonomy, unite with countries and nations in the world that sympathize with our country, and strive for world peace and justice.

(2) To do our best to maintain international peace organizations and conventions that guarantee international peace, and to strengthen their authority.

(3) To unite all forces that oppose Japanese imperialist aggression, to stop Japanese aggression, and to establish and guarantee the permanent peace of East Asia.

(4) To further enhance the existing friendship with all countries in the world in order to expand sympathy for our country.

(5) To deny and cancel all puppet organizations created by Japan by force in Chinese territory, and their internal and external activities.

During these seven or eight years, the international situation has changed dramatically. Sometimes it was favorable to our country's war of resistance, and sometimes it was unfavorable to our country's war of resistance. However, our country's diplomatic authorities, under the highest leader, have always adhered to this established diplomatic policy, that is, the so-called "using the immutable to deal with the ever-changing," and finally turned the international situation that was unfavorable to us into a situation that was favorable to us. Unlike the Japanese invaders' diplomacy, which was indecisive and often made mistakes, sometimes even "getting slapped on both sides of the face," making one mistake after another and falling into an irreparable predicament.

Over the past seven or eight years, our country's diplomatic measures have been countless, which cannot be described in detail in this article. However, to sum it up, in a nutshell, diplomacy during the War of Resistance was a complete success. Not only were all the measures appropriate, but also our country's ideal of "seeking self-reliance internally and seeking coexistence externally" was fully achieved.

(3)

The War of Resistance has ended in victory, and the international situation has also undergone unprecedented changes. Because the common enemies of the United Nations have been defeated. As a result, there is no common goal among the United Nations, and the conflicts of interest between each other have instead caused various contradictions. They could cooperate fully during the war, but now they cannot cooperate; they could tolerate each other during the war, but after the war they suspect each other. Thus, a rift has developed among the United Nations. All this is very obvious. Therefore, in Europe, repeated meetings of foreign ministers have been convened, but these problems cannot be solved. It was not until today that it was decided to convene a 21-nation peace conference on July 29th; and its future is difficult to be optimistic about. The same is true in the Far East. If the deadlock in Europe cannot be broken, the problems in the Far East cannot be solved alone.

Under this kind of international situation, what kind of diplomatic policy should our country adopt? In principle, it is to take "World Harmony" as the highest ideal and to take the United Nations, which supports collective security, as a means. However, whether adopting this means can achieve this goal is not a question under the current international environment.

As pointed out above, the post-war international situation is still in a state of turbulence. Whether in Europe or in the Far East, there is a tendency to "divide" but no phenomenon of "uniting." Why? The main factor is that the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union is getting farther and farther apart, more and more estranged, and even standing in opposition everywhere, like ice and charcoal, which are incompatible. Caught in the cracks of the contradictions between the United States and the Soviet Union, our country's diplomatic path has become narrower. At the same time, the ideal of "All Under Heaven Are One Family" is even less likely to be realized.

In the current stage of US-Soviet relations, the points of divergence between the US and the Soviet Union are very obvious. From the US point of view, it wants to maintain world peace and support the collective security system; but how can the United Nations be effective? It believes that it must have strength as its backing, so it insists on keeping the secret of atomic energy, which cannot be made public until the Soviet Union explains its territorial demands for Europe and the Far East, and then atomic energy can be handed over to international control. As for the Soviet Union, it believes that the United States' keeping the secret of atomic energy is intended to threaten it. Therefore, it feels that its own security is not guaranteed and has to haggle over its "safe zone." At the same time, for the United Nations, because the Soviet Union is too high and few agree with it, it has to use the minority to control the majority and insist that the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council should have the right to exercise the "veto." In the past ten months, the Soviet Union has used this privilege everywhere, making the United States helpless. Therefore, the United States is now developing a strong international movement that advocates that there should be no veto in any international conference. Otherwise, the United Nations cannot become an effective tool for maintaining world peace.

From this, it can be seen that today's world is still at a crossroads between war and peace. What kind of policy should our country adopt? It is indeed a question worth studying. In December of this year, the Political Consultative Conference also discussed future diplomatic policy. All parties and non-partisans unanimously agreed on four principles:

(1) To abide by the Atlantic Charter, the Cairo Declaration, the Moscow Four-Nation Declaration, and the United Nations Charter, and actively participate in the United Nations organization to ensure world peace.

(2) To liquidate Japan's remaining forces in China based on the Potsdam Declaration, and to cooperate with the Allies to protect the solution of the Japanese problem and prevent the resurgence of Japanese fascist militarist forces in order to ensure the security of East Asia.

(3) To maintain friendly relations with the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France, and other democratic countries, to abide by treaties and good faith, and to strive for economic and cultural cooperation in order to jointly promote world prosperity and progress.

(4) To quickly conclude commercial treaties with relevant countries based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, and to improve the status of overseas Chinese.

(4)

These four principles are not new, and our diplomatic authorities have already been working according to these principles. The problem now is how to implement them in the current complex international environment in order to achieve the goals of our country's diplomatic policy. We would like to offer the following suggestions for the reference of our diplomatic authorities.

First, we should recognize that under the current international environment, the idea of "All Under Heaven Are One Family" is still an ideal that cannot be realized for the time being. We must not be dependent and only want to rely on the United Nations to protect our security. Instead, we should "rely on our own efforts" and use our own military and intelligence to protect the country's survival. That is to say, in addition to burying ourselves in national construction, strengthening national defense, and increasing military preparedness, we must also use our intelligence to launch an independent diplomatic offensive. We should not be bound by idealism and remain unchanged, nor should we always take realism as our starting point, only knowing what is beneficial and not knowing what is just. For any international event, we must take the interests of the country and the nation as the premise. The people of the whole country may have differences of opinion on domestic affairs, but on diplomacy, they should have a common position and unified steps.

Second, China needs peace and needs to devote itself to the great cause of national construction and revival in a peaceful atmosphere. Therefore, we hope that all countries in the world can "unite" rather than "divide." Only a "united" international situation is beneficial to China. Especially for the United States and the Soviet Union, we cannot mix any emotional or emotional factors, but should treat them equally, without distinction. The Kuomintang needs the friendship of the Soviet Union, and the Communist Party also needs the goodwill of the United States. Anyone who advocates anti-American or anti-Soviet sentiment is detrimental to China. Moreover, we can go further and act as a bridge between the United States and the Soviet Union, promote understanding between the two countries, resolve suspicions and reconcile, and work together to establish a century-long plan for world peace. For example, US Secretary of State Byrnes recently advocated that in Europe, the UK, the US, the Soviet Union, and France should sign a 25-year treaty to disarm Germany, and in the Far East, he also proposed a 25-year treaty to disarm Japan to China, the UK, and the Soviet Union to prevent the resurgence of the power of Germany and Japan. The Soviet Union seems to be very cold about this. Our diplomatic authorities should make great efforts between the United States and the Soviet Union to bring them together so that these two treaties can be established at the same time, so as to establish two solid cornerstones for European peace and Far East security.

### A Major Artery Connecting North and South: The Canton-Hankow Railway is Revived!

— Special Dispatch from Guangzhou, Correspondent Ran Feng, 2nd

The Canton-Hankow Railway – this major artery traversing the three provinces of Hubei, Hunan, and Guangdong, connecting North and South – ever since Chairman Chiang ordered its complete repair and reopening by the end of June this year, the Railway Bureau, in order to fulfill this mission, has had all its employees working day and night, exerting themselves to the utmost to accelerate the repairs, and mobilized hundreds of thousands of civilians along the route. Starting work in January of this year, they have completed the task in just six months, despite extreme difficulties in manpower, materials, and finances; now, the entire line has been reopened.

Joyful Music, Train Starts

The grand ceremony for the full reopening of the Canton-Hankow Railway was held as scheduled on July 1st. On that day, eastern Guangzhou (formerly the Dashatou Station, now the Huangsha section renamed Guangzhou South Station) was decorated in a completely new fashion. Thousands of leaders and guests from all walks of life who came to participate in the grand ceremony crowded the station, almost blocking it entirely, all displaying expressions of boundless excitement and joy. At 4:00 PM, the ceremony began. Director Zhen Yuan of the Railway Bureau could not come to Guangzhou to participate due to other business. He had already sent a telegram commending all employees for their hard work in completing the reopening task, so the ceremony that day was presided over by Deputy Director Li Huixiang. Mr. Li gave a detailed report on the brief history of the railway's construction and the process of rushing the repairs this time as ordered. Following speeches by Chairman Luo of the Provincial Government, Director Huang Shuzhong of the Xingying Transportation Department, and others, the attendees successively stepped out onto the platform and walked to the front of the Guangzhou-Wuchang train composed of eight carriages. Amid the joyful music, Miss Qiongying, daughter of Mayor Chen, cut the ribbon, the engine started, and the train, carrying the first batch of 319 passengers, amidst the sounds of firecrackers and music, with a blast of the whistle, slowly headed straight towards Wuchang North, at 5:30 PM. It is expected to arrive in Wuchang in 68 hours.

After the meeting, the reporter interviewed Deputy Director Li Yaoxiang, Deputy Chief of Transportation Section Wen Bochang, and others, and learned from them the detailed process of this repair and reopening, and the many difficult and huge engineering aspects of the railway.

First Seek Reopening, Then Strive for Completion

The entire length of the Canton-Hankow Railway is 1,096 kilometers, with a total of 50 bridges, including the Yingde Bridge and the Qujiang Bridge; and 17 tunnels such as Gaolian Village, Fuyanshui, and Qimen. During the fall of the entire line, all were separately destroyed. All the large bridges and steel beams were completely blown up beyond repair. The tunnels were also filled with trucks loaded with iron ore and then detonated, so the repair of these bridges and tunnels naturally required considerable and extensive engineering. For example, the bridge piers of the Qujiang Railway Bridge were blown up to a depth of one meter. Construction took place during the rainy season on this turbulent Binjiang River, and the difficulty can be imagined. Also, such as the Gaolian Village north of Shaoguan and the mountain cave more than 300 meters long in Changsha, because they were completely destroyed, formal repairs were really not easy. Moreover, current transportation is obstructed, funds are not easily supplied, and construction materials are lacking. Now, only everything is being done in a simple and crude manner. Where bridges cannot be repaired, temporary bridges are temporarily built. Tunnels are bypassed by adding temporary lines. As for sleepers, almost all of them are taken from fir trees near the road. However, the foundations of these bridges are unstable, and if mountain floods break out, there is a risk of being washed away. After the steel beams from overseas are rushed to the site, the main bridges will be built to ensure permanent stability. At the same time, due to the loss of many railway tracks, some of them are now being transferred from the Xiang-Gui, Qian-Gui, and other lines. In the future, when the materials arrive, they will still need to be replaced.

Passengers First, Freight to Wait

Under the principle of "First Seek Reopening, Then Strive for Completion," the entire line has been reopened; but due to a lack of materials and imperfect equipment, it can only focus on passenger transport for the time being, and freight transport will have to wait for a while. Currently, in addition to two direct trains between Guangzhou and Wuchang per week, a material train runs daily from Kowloon to Hengyang. The Guangzhou to Shaoguan, Shaoguan to Hengyang, Hengyang to Changsha, and Changsha to Wuchang sections also have shuttle trains operating daily. The Guangzhou-Wuchang direct special express train departs every Monday and Thursday. The upward train departs from Guangzhou at 7:30 PM, and the downward train departs from Xujiapeng, Wuchang. Fares have been adjusted by order: 27,650 yuan for third class, double for second class, and the sum of second and third class fares for first class, which is 82,950 yuan. The sleeper ticket price is: 8,000 yuan national currency per night for the upper berth of first class, and 10,000 yuan per night for the lower berth. Originally, the entire journey from Guangzhou to Wuchang by direct train was expected to take 68 hours, but recently, incessant rainy weather has affected the journey, and it may be extended to 80 or 90 hours, because the newly built track in the Guangzhou-Shaoguan section has too loose a foundation, and can only travel 15 kilometers per hour. The Shaoguan-Wuchang section and below can travel faster, about 25 kilometers per hour. Calculated at an average speed of 20 kilometers per hour, the journey will take four days!

Return to Former Glory Within Half a Year

Locomotives are what the Railway Bureau currently lacks the most. According to the bureau's estimate, the entire line needs 376 locomotives, 390 combined passenger cars, 1,540 passenger cars, and 35 freight cars to meet transportation needs. But what they have now, pieced together and repaired from remnants, is only 80 locomotives, 48 combined passenger cars, and 141 passenger cars, so the transportation capacity is limited after the reopening, and it is inevitable that it cannot meet social needs; however, according to Deputy Director Li, if various transportation materials can be supplied steadily, then in half a year, the Canton-Hankow Railway can naturally fully restore to its pre-war state!

### Zhejiang Civil Servants' Bitter Lives? Many Protests

— Special Dispatch from Hangzhou, Correspondent Chu Yusheng

After the adjustment of salaries for civil servants in Zhejiang Province, the base salary is 55,000 yuan, with a multiple of 240, which is different from the base salary of 15,000 yuan and a multiple of 140 in Beijing and Shanghai. After learning of the salary adjustment, the civil servants expressed their dissatisfaction, arguing that the price level in Hangzhou is quite high and no less than that in Beijing and Shanghai. The provincial government decided to report the actual living conditions in Zhejiang to the central government and at the same time persuade the civil servants to work hard for the public. The details of the situation are summarized as follows:

During these eight or nine years of the War of Resistance, the civil servants moved three times with the Zhejiang government, from Hangzhou to Jinhua, from Jinhua to Fangyan, from Fangyan to Yunhe. At that time, there were pursuers behind them, and the future was uncertain, but they had a common belief, which was "Victory in the War of Resistance is certain!" Supporting the old and carrying the young, they disregarded all sacrifices and traveled all over the mountains and ridges, reaching the edge of Zhejiang.

Victory finally came, and they returned to Hangzhou from the edge of Zhejiang, supporting the old and carrying the young. They could finally see the charming West Lake again. Although the salaries were meager, they thought that this could be reasonably resolved and that this temporary phenomenon was unavoidable. The cost of living increased, and everything rose in price. Only the civil servants suffered, their salaries did not increase, and they only expected prices to stabilize and salaries to improve.

### A Declaration Like a Thunderbolt, Demanding Reasonable New Treatment

As expected, the salaries of civil servants in the Executive Yuan were finally adjusted. Hangzhou, which is adjacent to Shanghai and close to Nanjing, has a base salary of 55,000 yuan and a salary multiple of 250, so a civil servant with a base salary of 100 yuan only gets 79,100 yuan in total, an increase of 19,000 yuan. We observe that the cost of living here is similar to that of Shanghai, or even higher than that of Nanjing, and civil servants who live on salaries, to be honest, find it difficult to maintain a living.

After civil servants in Hangzhou learned of the salary adjustment, their sorrow turned into a common idea, which was to demand reasonable treatment. All agencies in the provincial capital received an "Emergency Declaration of Civil Servants," the main contents of which were: (1) We demand reasonable and equal treatment to solve the minimum living standards. (2) We oppose this unreasonable adjustment - subsidy multiple. (3) We support the salary adjustment plan proposed by the Legislative Yuan last time - a living allowance of 200,000 yuan, multiplied by 1,000 times. (4) We decided to hold a general meeting of all public school teachers and staff on June 7th at 4:00 PM in the Hangzhou Chamber of Commerce and take leave of absence to attend. Under this thunderbolt-like call, the Hangzhou Chamber of Commerce was packed with public school teachers and staff in the afternoon, a total of 1,500 to 1,600 people. Some made impassioned speeches, some were so excited that their throats were hoarse, some proposed a general strike, some proposed a general resignation, and some proposed a general leave of absence.

### Adjustment is Not a Good Policy, Seek a Thorough Solution

After the provincial government received this news, the heads of various provincial-level agencies separately persuaded and comforted them, but the general leave of absence on the 8th was finally implemented. The heads of the provincial-level agencies have urgently telegraphed Chairman Shen in Nanjing for instructions. It is said that Chairman Shen is also arguing reasonably in Nanjing. It is expected that there will be a solution soon.

But what if the salary adjustment is really adjusted according to the opinions of the civil servants in Zhejiang Province? "Prices" are a very cunning and man-eating tiger, and it will still wave its claws at the public school teachers and staff. It may even be laughing secretly, saying that you can't escape my grasp! Therefore, we must pay attention to the reasons for rising prices, whether it is due to a shortage of goods and a large population. Regarding this, the reporter consulted with an authoritative expert in economics, who said that according to the population of Hangzhou and the products of Hangzhou, it should definitely not rise so much. I am afraid that the same is true in Beijing and Shanghai. Since it is not a natural reason, there must be artificial reasons. If this artificial factor is not eradicated, how long will we salary-earning civil servants suffer?

We clearly see the government saying, "Sufficient sources," "No price increases allowed," but in fact, prices are rising on their own. What is the reason for this? I see that some people are tacitly protecting profiteers, some people are just getting by, and some people just don't want to suffer losses themselves. Originally, these are all Chinese habits, and Chinese "habits" are not thorough. We must find the root of the problem and solve it thoroughly so that such an unfortunate incident of a general leave of absence will not happen again.

Correction from a Letter to the Editor Mr. Editor: June 25th

Your newspaper published a communication from Wu Junyangzhen entitled "How Can There Be Boundaries in Preventing Tiger Plague," and on June 30th, your newspaper's Suzhou communication stated that the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau controlled vaccines and prohibited sales to other cities. After investigation, both are inconsistent with the facts. The reply is as follows: (1) According to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, ten trucks were provided to our bureau for the purpose of clearing garbage; and the Executive Yuan allocated 20 million yuan to purchase epidemic prevention equipment to assist local epidemic prevention. Both were handled during the tenure of the former director Yu Qian, and most of them had already been delivered, but the supply was only fully delivered now. After I took office, I sent a letter to the Executive Yuan requesting to borrow ten cars, but it was not approved, and the reply was "Sorry, I cannot comply." After repeated requests, it was agreed to send five trucks every day to pick up and drop off the staff of the office, and to use the remaining time to pick up and drop off epidemic prevention workers. Ten trucks were borrowed from the US military and two ambulances were borrowed from the fire department, and all were returned after the general mobilization for epidemic prevention was completed. In addition, 4,800 pounds of cotton, 4,980 pounds of DDT, 210 injection needles, and 45 sprayers and 625 pounds of DDT were borrowed from the US Red Cross. All must be returned within three months. It is clear that there is no distinction between thickness and thinness. (2) The vaccines used by our bureau are all made by our bureau's Health Experimental Institute and have a considerable reserve. It can still produce 40,000 doses per month. The words "controlling vaccines and prohibiting sales to other cities" are absolutely not true. For the above two items, please correct them together! Zhang Wei, July 1st.

### Answering Readers' Legal Questions

(1) Zhou Zhimin from Xiaoshan: A friend of mine rented a house in a certain county before the War of Resistance to run a business, and paid a deposit of several hundred yuan in legal tender. Now the landlord is very anxious to get the house back and must terminate the lease, but the price of legal tender before the war is very different from the current price of legal tender, and the problem arises in the value of the currency. (1) According to the government's interpretation of laws and regulations, if 10,000 yuan in legal tender was deposited in the bank before the war, only interest will be paid when it is paid out now, and it is definitely not possible to convert the pre-war value of the currency into materials. Is this correct at this moment? (2) Can the tenant ask the landlord to return the deposit by converting the pre-war value of the currency into materials, and then converting the materials into currency at today's prices to complete the formalities? Is there any legal basis for the above method?

"Answer by Lawyer Zhu Yakui" Although it is not possible to convert the currency value into materials and then convert the materials into currency value, according to Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Lawsuits After the Recovery, if it is obviously unfair, the court may be requested to make a fair ruling.

(2) Lu Weixiong asks: In the spring of 1943, a British merchant borrowed 100,000 yuan of Central Reserve Notes out of friendship, explaining that he would pay it back in face value in the future. There is a letter as proof (at that time, he was entering a concentration camp, and the price of rice was 400 yuan of puppet currency per dan). Now that the War of Resistance has been won, the British man has regained his freedom and is now living a wealthy life, but he is ignoring the loan.

1. Is there a legal provision for returning the loan at today's market price?

2. If he does not return it, how should it be resolved? Can I file a lawsuit? What are the procedures?

Please answer in detail, I am very grateful.

"Answer by Lawyer Zhu Yakui" (1) (2) According to Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Lawsuits After the Recovery, that is, if after the establishment of a legal act, due to reasons not attributable to the parties, the circumstances change, which could not have been foreseen at the time, and if the original effect is obviously unfair, the court should make a fair ruling and make a judgment to increase or decrease the payment or change its original effect. What you are asking about can be requested from the court to increase the amount at its discretion in accordance with the above article.

### Chaozhou and Shantou Disaster Victims Appeal: Save Disaster by Saving Food

Mr. Editor: After reading the newspaper, I saw that the Chaozhou and Shantou Association in Shanghai respectfully informed the fellow villagers in Shanghai to save at least one day of food per month, one thousand yuan per day. After reading it, I was very moved, and I would like to appeal to the fellow villagers in Shanghai on behalf of the disaster victims in Chaozhou and Shantou for help. I urge your newspaper to disclose this. In Chaozhou and Shantou today, where the rice famine is serious and the starving people are everywhere, all of us fellow villagers in Shanghai should actively participate in saving food, donate more, and be generous. The disaster victims are fortunate, and the homeland is fortunate! I would like to appeal to the fellow villagers in Shanghai on behalf of the disaster victims in Chaozhou and Shantou, "Save one more day of food" and "Save one more life," so that the disaster victims in Chaozhou and Shantou can avoid starving to death. The merits are immeasurable. The disaster situation in Chaozhou and Shantou is serious and truly unbearable to witness. Corpses are seen on the road every day. How can our enthusiastic people sit idly by and not save them? Finally, I would like to beg for help from all the benevolent people in Shanghai. Although Chaozhou and Shantou are small cities, they are also citizens of the Republic of China. Please treat everyone equally. The merits are immeasurable. Zheng Xingwen, one of the disaster victims in Chaozhou and Shantou, respectfully.

### The Anguish of Students Without Credentials

Mr. Editor: Today, I saw a notice on the bulletin board, the main point of which was, "By order of the Bureau of Education, all students must submit their credentials by a specific date for verification by the Bureau of Education. Those without credentials will not be approved. If they are not submitted within three days, they will be considered auditing students." Oh no! Are we students without credentials to be subjected to such punishment? Auditing students are merely appendages in the school. At the end of the semester, they don't receive transfer certificates, and upon graduation, they don't receive diplomas. In other words, society does not recognize us as high school students, and our education is greatly affected. The purpose of credentials is to prove a student's qualifications and level. What qualifications you have dictates what credentials you get. We have the qualifications, so why aren't we given the credentials we deserve? Moreover, can a single credential absolutely guarantee a student's qualifications and level? A student without qualifications, if they have money, can buy a diploma; if they have connections, they can finagle a transfer certificate. This is the dark side of society. We are confident that our academic knowledge is up to standard, which can be seen in our quiz scores. If the Bureau of Education wants to know our academic level, an exam is a legitimate method, so why not use it? If, after the exam, our qualifications are not enough for high school, we would willingly repeat a year. We absolutely cannot accept the term "auditing student." May I ask how many factories and companies are currently open in China that can provide work for us "auditing students" who seem to be "sentenced to death" with no way out? Speaking of which, someone will surely question us, "Why don't you have transfer certificates?" I can tell you that some of us studied in "puppet schools." When the "puppet schools" were taken over by "real schools," we were eliminated. There are also some who fled to the countryside during the war, but still did not lose their ambition to study, diligently studying on their own. After the victory, they don't have certificates and will also suffer the fate of being "auditing students." There are even more who lost their certificates and whose schools have closed, making it impossible to resubmit them. Wouldn't that be a cry of endless suffering? Someone will surely ask again, "Why study at a puppet school? Why not study in the Great Rear Area?" Our only answer is one word: "No money." As for the so-called puppet schools, I didn't read books like "Greater East Asia," "Divine Japan," or "Peaceful Nation Building," which promoted slave education. As for "Japanese," almost every school opened by Chinese in the occupied areas taught "Japanese." If we shouldn't study Japanese, please have the Ministry of Education close all the current "German classes." The people in the occupied areas have endured days of deep suffering, and now they have to suffer such a blow from the democratic government? In our High School Class B, with eighty people, almost half don't have certificates. It's probably the same in other grades, and there are quite a few other schools with this situation. Oh no! The futures of so many young students are going to be buried! Finally, we earnestly request that the Ministry of Education postpone the implementation of this measure for two years. We know that your newspaper's opinions are fair and speak for the people. We are writing this article in the hope that it will be published. Signed, Yu Guan'ao, He Zhijian, and Wang Jinlin, students without credentials from High School Class B, Zhaohe Middle School.

The Same Academic Ability Should Qualify for University Entrance

Mr. Editor: Some time ago, your newspaper discussed the issue of selecting talented students for studying abroad. The last paragraph briefly stated that the qualifications for studying abroad should not be limited to university graduates with diplomas, because there are many young people who study diligently on their own and have the equivalent of a university degree, and aspire to study abroad, but because they don't have a diploma, they cannot participate in the exam, which is still a loss in terms of the country recognizing talent. Therefore, to select true talent, as long as the exam is strict, why is a diploma necessary? After reading it, I felt very encouraged. These are the heartfelt words of ambitious young people without diplomas, and it can also be said to be a kind of anguish. Fortunately, your newspaper solemnly raised it. Recently, the Ministry of Education issued the qualifications for the study abroad exam, adding the item of "Higher Examination," which is held by the Examination Yuan's Examination and Selection Committee during the Higher Examination. Although there is still a distance from what your newspaper said, it can be seen that the Ministry of Education is paying attention to this and is taking action. Therefore, it reminds me that the qualifications for university entrance examinations should also include the item of "equivalent academic ability." Because during these eight years of the War of Resistance, countless young people lost their education. Directly, their homes were destroyed, and they not only lost their education but also became refugees. Indirectly, due to the war, their parents or siblings could not maintain the family's livelihood. And I am a child who lost my father early in life. Usually, I rely on my old mother's savings to barely continue my studies, but when prices soared and even making a living became a problem, I could only drop out of school and go into business. How could my parents bear to let their children suffer the pain of losing their education? How could my old mother bear to let me take on the heavy burden of life at a young age? However, we, these young people who lost our education, swallowed our bitter tears and "voluntarily dropped out of school" to work. However, we never forgot to study in our spare time, so it was like work-study, but not as good as work-study. Work-study is going to a formal school to study, and finding work outside of class to support one's personal life, but we have to use what we earn to maintain part or all of our living expenses, stealing time from our busy lives to study some main subjects, such as Chinese and English. But higher education, specializing in a certain science, is not available in tutoring schools. Fortunately, Hujiang, Soochow, and Datong Universities, Chengming College of Commerce, and Lixin Accounting School all have evening classes set up purely for working youth. However, only Lixin has the item of "equivalent academic ability" that can be taken in the exam. The Ministry of Education educates the people, just like parents raise their children, it is a responsibility and an obligation. People receiving education is the enjoyment of a right. Therefore, the country must ensure that every person can obtain this full right, even disabled or deaf-mute people, they must also find ways to provide them with a corresponding education. Now the Ministry of Education takes in and trains refugee youth, and society provides student aid to parents who cannot afford tuition, and schools also have scholarships for the poor. All of these are intended to prevent young people from losing their education. Therefore, I hope that universities with evening classes will add equivalent academic ability to the qualifications for entrance examinations. (Lixin Vocational School already has it in the last issue, and the Chinese American Evening Post on the 25th had information about the entrance examination of National Central University, and equivalent academic ability was also included in the qualifications for the entrance examination.) As long as the exam is strict, there won't be people with too much difference in level mixing in. But those with slightly lower levels should also be admitted leniently, and given a probationary period in the first semester. If, after the probationary period, their grades are too poor, they should be given the opportunity to make up for it, so that they can keep up with the class in an orderly manner. If the probationary grades are still acceptable, they will be promoted to the second semester as formal students. In this way, young people who have lost their education will not be excluded from the school. Reader, Tang Jin, High School. June 26th.

### The Road to Reforming Chinese Education

— Zhang Wenyu

By Zhuang Zeyi, Published by Zhonghua Book Company

First edition, January of the 35th year of the Republic

The War of Resistance against Japan has ended in victory, and the overall situation in China has changed with the global situation. Which path should Chinese education take? The author does not clearly point out this question in this book. This is because the book was completed in the 30th year of the Republic, and is based on the author's lecture notes on "Chinese Education Problems" given to postgraduate students of education at Lingnan University in the autumn of the 29th year of the Republic. Regarding education issues, the author first describes past solutions to various problems, as well as their difficulties and shortcomings, and then supplements them with the paths that he has advocated for the past 20 years. Here is a summary of the main points:

(1) Academic Education – The author advocates that university education should focus on academic research and be separated from specialized schools of a technical, professional, or vocational nature. The courses offered in universities should be determined by the professors' expertise, and the curriculum should not be predetermined and then forcing professors to teach courses that are not their strengths. Therefore, university presidents and professors must be academic experts, and politicians and merchants should not be allowed to interfere. University student entrance exams should select true talent and should not be limited by qualifications. There are two goals for sending students abroad: to apply what they have learned and to conduct academic research. However, since the War of Resistance against Japan, there has been a passive policy of studying abroad that completely ignores academic research.

(2) Specialized and Vocational Education – The nature and status of specialized schools lie in training specialists and cultivating institutions for various technologies. The establishment of specialized schools should be adapted to the times and circumstances and must be closely related to the central or provincial construction plans. After the War of Resistance against Japan, the training institutes for local cadres established in the rear provinces placed too much emphasis on formal training and neglected skills training. The author believes that the training of local cadres should refer to the prior experience of the Shandong Zouping Rural Construction Research Institute, dividing it into research and training departments. The training of mid-level vocational talents should be linked to public and private factories, transportation, medicine, surveying, accounting, and other institutions, and practical vocational schools should be widely established. At the same time, attention should be paid to promoting vocational training and supplementary education for workers. If the method of teacher training in normal schools is still adopted, it is feared that it will be less effective. A three-in-one system should be implemented, with principals of national and central schools also serving as local construction cadres. Teacher training can adopt the method of the Zouping Rural Construction Training Department, recruiting junior high school graduates for training. As for the training of teachers for various secondary schools, normal colleges should train teachers for ordinary middle schools, and departments of arts and sciences in universities should be allowed to minor in more than ten credits in education to prepare them for teaching positions, while teachers for vocational schools must be trained by agricultural, industrial, and commercial specialized colleges.

(3) General Education – Ordinary middle schools are institutions that prepare students for further education, and ordinary middle schools also serve as vocational preparation, resulting in neither achieving either goal. Since middle schools are institutions that prepare students for further education, the curriculum should be based on further education. Graduation exams hinder academic progress and health. If grade promotion and elimination are strictly enforced, graduation exams are not necessary. The current national education system is four years, but in terms of national finance and the national economic situation, it is extremely difficult to achieve. If the age of enrollment is raised and completed in two years, and then supplementary education is provided, the effect will be greater. The senior elementary school system is copied from Japan. If the senior elementary school is abolished and the middle school is changed to an eight-year system, with four years for junior high school and four years for senior high school, it will be easier to achieve results.

(4) Social Education – Popularizing basic education for out-of-school people, focusing on literacy education and also focusing on the instilling of common knowledge. The establishment of civil education centers, libraries, museums, etc., should take into account material resources and human resources. In terms of civil education centers, the facilities for livelihood should be more important than the literacy section. To effectively implement electrical education, there must be specialized personnel to manage it. These specialized personnel can be trained by the construction colleges in various provinces. Other things such as drama and music are also important tools for promoting social education and must be promoted. Addendum on education in the border areas and education for overseas Chinese. Border education should be divided into two types: one for the Han people in the border areas and one for the education of the Mongolian, Tibetan, Hui, Miao, and other ethnic groups. Education for the Han people in the border areas should be no different from that of the Han people in the interior, and education for all ethnic groups should be treated with absolute equality. Regarding education for overseas Chinese, the goals are talent and funding, and the fundamental solution lies in consolidating the facilities for education for overseas Chinese and enhancing the status of overseas Chinese.

(5) Educational Administration and Funding – The authority of the central educational administration should be gradually reduced to allow for the free development of education in various places that is more suitable for local needs. Provincial and county local educational administrative agencies should be improved, and more normal schools should be established in various provinces to be responsible for the educational administration of various regions, and educational and political personnel below the county level should also be specialized in their positions. Inspection and guidance should be promoted simultaneously, and advisory and research institutions should be established in a practical manner. The treatment of teachers must be improved and the teaching profession must be guaranteed. Not only should educational funding be increased, but it must also be used properly. Private schools should be valued and encouraged.

After reading this book, I have a feeling that the author's analysis is well-organized and comprehensive, which is his strength. The title of the book is "The Road to Reforming Chinese Education," but what is the direction of the reform? The author does not point out the basic trend of reforming Chinese education, nor does he propose a reform plan that targets the poor, weak, ignorant, and selfish educational background of China. What China needs now is education that cultivates democracy and the rule of law, and education that cultivates scientific construction. The promotion of academics must have free development research, and the training of skills must naturally take life and welfare as its goals. Therefore, democracy and science are the general directions for reforming Chinese education.

### Nehru's Autobiography

— Zhu Jiaqing

Translated by Bi Lai, Published by Xinzhi Bookstore

"The ultimate goal of India is a united, free, and democratic country: she is closely connected with other free nations in a world federation." – Nehru.

Mr. Nehru is the leader of the Indian National Congress. He was born in Allahabad on November 14, 1889. His father and uncle both practiced law. Especially his father, although he was an Indian bourgeois who admired the British gentleman's style, he was a fervent veteran of the national independence movement. His mother, wife, and sisters also contributed their efforts to the Indian independence movement. This had a profound influence on Mr. Nehru's personality.

Mr. Nehru lived in a pampered environment in his childhood. At that time, the Indian people not only endured the pain of British oppression, but also suffered from the bullying of Anglo-Indian mixed-race people and the Indian social classes. These unequal phenomena and painful lessons left a deep impression on Mr. Nehru's young mind.

Mr. Nehru left India for England to study at the age of fifteen. England was a country with a strong interest in politics. At that time, India was also constantly launching a struggle for national independence. This determined the form of his life after returning to China. When he was in Cambridge, he had already responded to Tilak's radicals in spirit, advocating opposing kneeling to England in a heroic posture.

At that time, the Fabian Socialism (Jabian Social Sm) in England was popular for a while, and Mr. Nehru was very interested in it; this laid a foundation for his political thought.

In the autumn of 1912, Mr. Nehru obtained his qualifications. He returned to China to carry out his family's law business. At that time, it was just before the outbreak of the First World War, and nationalism and patriotism filled the whole world; India was of course greatly disturbed. The independence movement was actively launched from this. Following that was the brutal suppression by the British, which led to a fierce struggle. As a result, a large number of Indian people were massacred or arrested. Seeing this situation, Mr. Nehru and his father resolutely gave up their careers and participated in the struggle of the Indian nation. They responded to Mahatma Gandhi's civil resistance movement and engaged in various anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggles.

At that time, the Indian political movement was centered on the bourgeoisie and ignored the vast masses of workers and peasants. Mr. Nehru, with his fearless spirit, engaged in various labor movements and won their love and support.

In 1921, due to the vigorous development of the non-cooperation movement, and the opposition to the visit of the British Crown Prince in various places in India; it constituted a full-scale Indian riot. Many colleagues working in the National Assembly were arrested. Mr. Nehru and his father were also imprisoned one after another. This was the first time in his political activities that he had lived such a prison life. Because of the surging Indian revolutionary movement, it was commonplace for Mr. Nehru and he was ready at any time. However, he was very good at using his prison life to read and write; to study various Indian and international issues.

Mr. Nehru has been arrested and imprisoned more than a dozen times in political struggles. The longest imprisonment has lasted for nearly three years. Until recently, we could still read news of his arrest and release in the news!

Mr. Nehru has chaired the National Assembly twice, and has also served as the secretary of the Assembly many times. In this National Assembly, sometimes due to the evolution of the political situation, it was divided into "moderates", "radicals", or "revisionists" and "conservatives". In fact, the so-called "moderate" and "revision" are just attempts to compromise with the British. Among them, of course, the voice of "regional autonomy" is the highest.

The absurdity of the theory of regional autonomy is despised by Mr. Nehru and others. They take Islam as the starting point and emphasize "Islamic culture". They believe that the culture between India and Islam is irreconcilable. Therefore, their conclusion is that British rule must always exist in India in order to reconcile the conflict between the two cultures. This argument is really aiding and abetting the tiger. We place unlimited regrets on the success of the Indian independence movement.

Mr. Nehru's political proposition is a thorough revolution; not a superficial renewal. What he is fighting for for India is complete independence; and it is by no means begging for favor from Britain, attempting to get some favor.

This proposition is very different from that of Mahatma Gandhi. Mahatma Gandhi's attention is on the personal religious influence; to put it plainly: this is simply political religionization. Mr. Nehru is not like this; although he supports Mahatma Gandhi's revolutionary means, he cannot agree with the views of praising "poverty", "suffering", and "self-control"; promoting "simple peasant life"; and denying that "science is enough to improve human life." In short, Mahatma Gandhi's thought is purely Indian, personal, religious, and backward; while Mr. Nehru's thought is Europeanized, national, scientific, and progressive.

In fact, this "Nehru Biography" is better to be read as a history of the Indian national revolution than as a biography. Of course, Mr. Nehru's strong national consciousness and patriotic enthusiasm are worthy of our young people's respect.

### Introducing Several Radio Publications

— Mu Zai

After the war, the radio amateur activities that had been interrupted for a while have gradually recovered their past prosperity, and radio publications have also appeared one after another. They are introduced separately as follows:

(1) "Radio World" Monthly – This is a publication sponsored by C.A.R.L., written by amateur radio operators from all over the country. It was founded in Chongqing. Due to material limitations, only one sheet of four-open newspaper type was published, a total of two issues. After the victory, it was once suspended. It has been revived in Beijing in February of this year and has published four issues. The content of the publication is more extensive, divided into columns such as special essays, experiments, communications, introductory guides, rare news, and amateur scenery. The selection of materials is deeper. In addition to the long series of introductions to radio, which is very suitable for beginners, the experimental fee is less. It is heard that it is gradually being improved and experimental manuscripts and reference circuits are being added to help beginners. The publication has many wonderful manuscripts and is worthy of amateur comrades' research and reference.

(2) Practical Radio Magazine – The publication was founded before the war and was suspended after the fall of Shanghai. It has now been revived in January of this year and published three issues. The content is also lacking in experimental manuscripts because amateur research was affected by the war and was suspended. However, the selection of materials and layout have been greatly improved and enriched compared to the previous "Electrical Engineering", and it tends to explore radio theory. The writers are all amateurs in Shanghai.

(3) Amateur Radio Magazine – This publication is not run by the Chinese Amateur Radio Association, and has nothing to do with C.A.R.L. It is published by the Amateur Radio Research Society. It was published before the war and was suspended after the fall of Shanghai. It was revived in May of this year. The content is still the same as before the war. Extremely poor, although there are many circuit diagrams, they are all experimental manuscripts that have not been tested. The effectiveness is not to be easily believed. It is hoped that the publication can fully improve and help amateur researchers.

### Review of Zhang Dongsun's "Thought and Society"

— Traditional Light

I previously introduced and briefly reviewed Mr. Zhang Dongsun's book "Knowledge and Culture" in this publication. Mr. Dongsun wrote to say, "Your comments were insightful and deeply appreciated." Later, he sent me a copy of his recently published "Thought and Society" in Chongqing, a sequel to the former book, and informed me that "Reason and Democracy" would be published by the end of September. These are three books he wrote during the period of occupation. We feel that Mr. Zhang has fulfilled his duty during the Anti-Japanese War. We further hope that Mr. Zhang will devote most of his time and energy to philosophical writing in the future. This is not to discourage Mr. Zhang from concerning himself with politics, but I would prefer that he maintain the attitude of a philosopher. As he himself said, "A philosopher is not responsible for administration. Because if he becomes an administrative leader, he may not be able to preserve his ideals and will inevitably have to compromise. The value of a philosopher lies in his ability to see the ideal and to know what is true and good." (Thought and Society, page 194)

In recent years, Mr. Zhang's research has aimed to establish a complete epistemology from the perspectives of psychology, philosophy, and sociology. He has elaborated on this point in detail in his book "Knowledge and Culture." The goal of "Thought and Society," which we are reviewing now, is to explain "the relationship between theoretical knowledge, represented by philosophy, and practical social life." On the one hand, he explains how theoretical knowledge is determined by human social life; on the other hand, he expounds on the guiding role of theoretical speculation in social progress and human behavior. This question is also what I have been trying to answer in recent years. My humble work "Education and Social Reconstruction" also seeks a way out in this regard. However, my humble work focuses more on social evolution, while Mr. Zhang's "Thought and Society" is still more inclined toward philosophical theory. Mr. Zhang's basic attitude in this book is that "all past philosophies are merely the theorization of social thought," and that the new philosophy he has created is "in response to the cultural needs of this era." In short, theoretical knowledge is both a product of social life and has a guiding influence on social life. Thus, he incidentally finds a way to explain why he studies philosophy and also engages in politics.

The entire book consists of nine chapters, which can be divided into six parts: (1) A general discussion of the social factors of human thought (Chapter 1 of the original book); (2) An explanation of three systems of knowledge; (3) The relationship between philosophy and social organization (Chapters 3 and 4 of the original book); (4) China's Daoist tradition—family thought and Neo-Confucian thought (Chapters 5 and 6); (5) The Western Daoist tradition—Christian thought, socialism, and ____-ism (Chapters 7 and 8); (6) The way out for Chinese culture (Chapter 9). This publication has previously provided a brief introduction to the content. This article only intends to directly raise a few points for criticism. However, Mr. Zhang's books should not be read in a fragmented way but should be viewed as a whole. Therefore, readers who wish to understand Mr. Zhang's entire thought must read the original book in one sitting.

From Mr. Zhang's writings, we can see that he has two strengths, which are also his weaknesses. Mr. Zhang has a very high intellect, so he often has very profound "insights." He grasps the core of the problem and puts forward rich insights. This is his first strength. However, because he has high wisdom and rich insights, he often directly presents many conclusions, neglecting to guide the reader along a clear logical path, and rarely gives us reasons for proof (Arguments). Therefore, when we read Mr. Zhang's book, we jump around from one place to another.

Secondly, Mr. Zhang has extensive knowledge, and his reading is truly admirable. Therefore, his thinking is multifaceted and his meaning is very complex. He often feels that he has a thousand words to say and can't stop pouring them out when he encounters a problem. As a result, he leads the reader meanderingly to an unknown destination. He promises the reader to solve this problem, but after he has just said it, he talks about another problem. The reader feels that the answer seems irrelevant to the question. In fact, there may be a close connection between them, but it is too complex or too lengthy for us to grasp.

When Mr. Zhang discusses the Daoist tradition of China and the West, he only talks about the connection of a few dominant concepts in the history of thought. As for why these concepts are adapted to the cultural needs of the time and how they affect the social situation at the time, Mr. Zhang does not tell us, which does not seem to conform to the main theme of the book.

Finally, regarding the way out for Chinese culture, Mr. Zhang only focuses on the scholar class (i.e., intellectuals), as if as long as they serve as the outlet for society and contribute to the entire culture, "constantly resisting the tendency of culture itself to become petrified," this nation can be revived. I dare not believe this. Our national character has its own living background. If the living background does not change, and only a general scholar class expresses pure opinions, I believe that the nation has no way to improve. In my opinion, if politics does not get on the right track and economic life does not improve, even if the "Education Association" is successfully established, at most it will only train a group of bookworms. It is important to know that if bees do not collect flower stamens but eat tree roots, they cannot produce honey. An intellectual or a group of intellectuals cannot create new blood in a political situation where they are not fed enough, are barely alive, and are constantly fighting for power and profit. Of course, I am not saying that thought has no impact on the social situation, but if you want to find a way out for a culture, in addition to the inspiration of thought, you must work simultaneously in politics, economy, social atmosphere, and other aspects.

### After Reading "Early Love"

— Zheng Jia'ai

Ruvim Frayerman is a talented young Soviet novelist; he first moved Soviet readers with a full-length novel about the revolutionary youth of Northeast China, called: Vassaka Red Partisan. In 1940, his first masterpiece, Early live "Early Love," was translated into English and published in "International Literature" in the January, February and March issues; later, this novel was adapted into a new play and performed at the "Moscow Young Audience Theater." In the spring of 1941, Mr. Hu Shanyuan translated it into Chinese and introduced it to our country's readers.

The title "Early Love" easily leads people to mistake it for a "pure love" tragic masterpiece, but after you read it, you will find that there is no tortuous and bizarre romantic novel here; as the translator said: "If you hold any 'romantic' or 'erotic' thoughts in mind when you look at its plot, you will be disappointed. You still have to look at it with the eyes of appreciating the structure of a peerless masterpiece, then you will get your wish and return fully loaded…"; indeed, this is a good novel that cannot be ignored in literary works, and the author's characteristic is "rich in lyrical sentences and psychological analysis." "Early Love" takes children as the protagonists. Frayerman fully developed his talent and intelligence when describing these children's "statues." The most ordinary stories are the most meaningful and the most vivid. "Early Love" cannot find the words "love" or "like," but the whole story is full of immortal friendship and love.

……

Danya, the girl who had just turned fifteen, had always been a good friend of Nanna youth Philga. Every year, when summer was over and the camping life ended, they returned home to wait for the start of another semester.

Danya and her mother lived with an old nanny. Her small home was always very peaceful. Her mother was a good assistant in the hospital, and Danya studied at school, but she was dissatisfied and unhappy because she had never seen her father——now he lived far away in Moscow, loved another woman, and separated from his wife many years ago when Danya was still a baby.

This time, Danya had just returned from camping, and she unintentionally found a letter from her father to her mother, saying that he was coming back soon, and also bringing his mistress and the mistress's nephew, called Gaoliya, with him. With a happy mood, she rushed to the pier on that morning to greet her father, but when the passengers on the ship were gone, she could not find the person she wanted to receive, so she had to return disappointed. Before leaving, she put lilies beside the boy sleeping on the stretcher. She sobbed softly, who knew that this boy was Gaoliya.

Father finally came to see Danya, and she got infinite joy, but Father still lived with his mistress elsewhere, and Danya's mood was sad.

At school, Philga was originally Danya's good friend. Since Gaoliya came, he was even more able to make Danya pay attention to her and fall in love with him. Philga felt unbearable pain, but did not hurt their friendship. He cherished Danya more than himself; although Danya was not as fond of him as before.

Festivals, New Year, and many happy days passed. In a violent storm, Danya encountered difficulties in saving Gaoliya, but fortunately, Philga led everyone to rescue them, and they were able to escape the danger. Philga had always been a good boy.

Finally, Danya decided to give up love for the sake of her only mother's happiness, and she left the two boys; but none of them could forget each other, and Danya was always a good friend in their minds.

The author of "Early Love" presents a vivid picture before our eyes with his precise psychological analysis and superior technology. Although the background of this story is in the ice and snow of the northern country, although the personalities of the protagonists are so rough and stubborn, and although there are no moving and great scenes in it; "Early Love" is still beautiful; the name can remind people of the atmosphere there: the river that children love is dark; the mountains covered with fir trees flow, ants crawl all over the bark, children chew resin with their snow-white teeth, and they prefer to eat venison. In winter, heavy snow covers the vast plains and cliffs. Sometimes there should be terrible storms coming. This novel not only renders a strong local color, but the most unforgettable thing is the description of the mood; we know that the psychology of children in the last period is very complicated and subtle; writers with poor cultivation are very difficult to portray vividly, but Frayerman is successful. He wrote delicately and beautifully, and many beautiful words flowed out naturally, like a gurgling stream in a deep mountain, and your mood followed it to that realm, so you seemed to clearly see the mountains, waters, vegetation, wind, snow and birds and animals in that place, and your emotions were more closely tied to the children's joy and sorrow, unable to get rid of them. When Danya first approached her father, the author wrote this;

"She leaned gently on his shoulder.

"Tell me everything, maybe I can help you, what is bothering you, what's on your mind?"

But she said nothing, because what she was thinking at that time was: "I have a mother, a home, a meal, even a dog and a cat, but I don't have a father…"

She only squeezed closer to him, leaning on his chest.

But, ah, leaning on Father's chest, how sweet that is! Jumping now is not spring, although it is humid outdoors here after the cold rain, although there are some chills under the thin clothes, but even on this late autumn evening, Danya felt warm? She and her father sat together for a long time, until the stars she loved shone on the road to the fortress, on the lime-sprinkled path, and on the house with glass doors."

The following is a description of Danya's dream:

“…So what happened today? Is it that the river flowing into the sea put these strange thoughts into her head? She had watched the river with a vague premonition, she had hoped to float with it, but where to go? Why are the thoughts of Australian wild dogs so tempting to her? What do Australian wild dogs have to do with her? Is this because her childhood is slowly slipping away? Who can really know when childhood will end and the next era will begin?…”

Later, Danya was about to leave her old home, and Philga was very embarrassed when he learned the news. He cut the five letters "Tanya" (丹雅) out of white paper and put them on his chest, letting the sun scorch them every day. As a result, his body left white names. He was seen by Danya: "You are such a child, Philga, but when winter comes, you put on a warm shirt, and it will fade completely." Philga's face was depressed, and he looked around in confusion, the hot sand and the river sparkled in the mountains, like a golden valley. His inner turmoil reached its peak, he completely forgot about winter, and when he exposed his body to the scorching sun, he didn't think about winter at all.

"Oh, what kind of person am I!" he cried.

"But the sun is so powerful, he insisted, "It won't disappear completely, will it? Maybe something will be left, Danya?" he pleaded.

Danya thought for a moment and agreed.

"You are right," she said, "Something will definitely be left. Everything will disappear, that won't happen. Otherwise, where will our eternal friendship go?"

The two children embraced, and the warm air fanned their cheeks, and a lonely bird poked its head out from their tall branches to look at them.

Childhood has ended! But exactly when? Who can solve this mystery for them? Not sand, not forest, not stones, those are always with them….”

"Early Love" is an excellent novel, and I would like to introduce it to readers who love literature and art.

Spring and Autumn

### A Brief Discussion on the Techniques of Novels

— Hu Shanyuan

In the past few months, I have made up my mind to read all the short and long stories published in various new magazines. The result is this:

All formal novels, that is, novels published in formal magazines, except for a very small part that is slightly entertaining or propagandistic, can be praised for their content, have valuable themes, and can inspire, motivate, or make people think deeply. However, their techniques are the opposite, and they can be compared with the most excellent or the latest techniques. There are very few of them, and most of them are either top-heavy, or bloated and deformed, or tell stories, or talk about love, or write introductions, or write manuals, unlike writing novels. On the contrary, some novels published in entertainment magazines without serious and profound content have very satisfactory techniques: they can really be worthy of the evaluation of well-proportioned bones and flesh, and careful weighing.

Why is this happening? Of course, it is better to have poor techniques than poor content. Good content does not waste ink, and good techniques alone are definitely not the mission of a novel. However, what a wonderful thing it would be to have good content paired with good techniques! Moreover, with good techniques, it is not easy to install good content, because content is as if it can be forced, and techniques are just experience and effort. With good content, it is not difficult to obtain good techniques. Now the reason why good content is not paired with good techniques may be these points:

One is that the importance of content is overemphasized, while techniques are ignored. If authors with content can pay more attention to techniques, they will definitely be able to solve various difficulties and shortcomings in techniques. One is that techniques are fundamentally looked down upon. This only requires that the author eliminate his prejudice. One is that the author does not know how to write to qualify. It is not difficult, as long as you refer to writers and works who are good at techniques.

In the past, Lu Xun's and Ye Shaojun's short stories could be used as models of techniques. As for long novels, Mao Dun's techniques are relatively the most successful. In terms of countries, there are many, not to mention Maupassant, who is farther away, Gorky, who is closer, is very qualified, and most of the recent writers can also be imitated. (The "Arch of Triumph" published in Zhengyan Newspaper is really a good specimen of techniques. Not many people paid attention when it was published, and now it is not published anymore, which is a pity!)

In recent years, in Shanghai, there are several people who write novels well, that is, those with proper content and excellent techniques: such as Shen Ji, Shi Qi, Guo Peng, and Tang Xuehua. Now Shi Qi can still see his works, but the others cannot be seen. I don't know if they are still writing. I don't mean to praise them. People who are interested in research may wish to find their works and take a look.

Now the old writers in the mainland are gradually returning, and I hope that I can soon see many novels that are satisfactory in techniques in addition to content.

### Illusion (Novel)

— Junping

The first major event after Liu Qinghua returned from the Great Rear Area was to announce his unemployment.

His wife felt very anxious, and he himself was also very anxious. Although they could maintain their current life for the time being, what would they do in the future? In the past, when he taught in the Great Rear Area, although life was poor, he could still live on by gritting his teeth. Now, it was simply a big problem how to even survive. Moreover, in the initial three years in the rear, Liu Qinghua was a single wanderer, but now he was the father of two children. He never imagined that after returning to Shanghai from Kunming, he would have nothing to do. He never imagined that his current situation would be even more wretched than the worst times in the past few years.

His wife was not only a fatalist but also a very kind woman. She had no complaints about the current situation, but she couldn't help but feel anxious about the children's lack of nutrition. These situations made Liu Qinghua feel indescribable guilt. He felt that she and the children were innocent and should not suffer like this. Since he had become someone's husband and father, he should support them even in terms of morality, let alone the responsibility he had to fulfill today was far more than just a moral one.

Early in the morning, when he stepped out the door, he saw his wife, Pingping, and Tian Tian, the two children, standing at the entrance of the lane. Pingping saw her father coming and immediately grabbed his long gown: "Daddy, bring Pingping a doll."

"Okay, okay,"

"Daddy, Tian Tian wants candy too." Tian Tian also came over and grabbed him.

"Definitely bring it, definitely bring it."

"Don't pull on Daddy's clothes. Daddy will bring it to you later." His wife hurried over to relieve him.

He didn't know how many times he had given the children such empty promises. Later, even the children began to doubt his promises. Once, Pingping said to him:

"Daddy, the little sister next door bought a toy car yesterday. Why don't you buy me a doll?"

"Daddy will definitely buy one for you."

"Daddy doesn't keep his word. When exactly are you going to buy it?"

When exactly was he going to buy it? Even he himself had no certainty. But he didn't want to see the children's disappointed expressions. He tried his best to keep deceiving them, even though the children had been deceived countless times.

"Buy it tomorrow, definitely buy it for you tomorrow."

He said tomorrow every day, but he never bought it back. Although the children didn't understand the ways of the world, experience told them that Daddy's words were never reliable and had never been fulfilled. Liu Qinghua felt very bitter inside, but he couldn't say anything and wouldn't say anything. He thought that he couldn't even fulfill this minimal request of the children, and he really felt sorry for them. But today, not to mention dolls, even the daily necessities such as firewood, rice, oil, and salt were causing him headaches. So, it didn't seem like an excessive request to offer a perfunctory attitude towards the children's extra demands.

When he strolled back from the street in the evening, the children were already asleep. His wife was sitting on the edge of the bed reading a book, and there seemed to be a hint of melancholy in the silence.

"Did you see Principal Xu today?" his wife asked with great concern.

"I saw him, but..." His expression wasn't very good: "But seeing him and not seeing him is actually no different."

"Why? Can't he find a way to help you?"

"He said that this semester, there's no way to think of anything. If there are any teacher vacancies next semester, he will definitely find a way to arrange something for you. Isn't that the same as saying nothing? There are still six weeks until next semester. Do you think we can maintain our lives for six weeks with this money?"

"If we use it sparingly, we can barely manage for four weeks."

"It's better to rely on yourself than to ask for help from others. Instead of bowing and scraping to ask people for help and seeking referrals, it's better to find a job myself. Roads are made by people walking. Don't you think so?"

His wife nodded because she really had nothing to say. During these many days, it wasn't that Liu Qinghua wasn't trying to find work, but all he got in return was cold ridicule or just empty talk. Once a person becomes poor, even familiar relatives and friends will become strangers. If there really is warmth in the human world, it's only heard of and not seen. Now, not only was Liu Qinghua starting to doubt many things in the world, but even his wife felt that there was little optimism in asking others to find a job. However, his wife still had to ask him:

"You said you'll find a job yourself. How are you going to find it?"

"I saw in the newspaper today that a business company is hiring clerks, and the salary is 200,000 yuan per month, in addition to providing board and lodging. I'm going to try it out, whether it succeeds or not."

His wife was very excited because she knew that he wasn't a layman in clerical work. Although he couldn't say he had any certainty in this, among many uncertain events, this seemed to have a little bit of certainty.

The next morning, Liu Qinghua hurried to the Dasheng Enterprise Company. The enterprise company borrowed a right wing room from someone to do business, and the scale was very small. He walked into the right wing room and only saw two slick young men sitting on the sofa chatting.

"Excuse me, is this the Dasheng Enterprise Company?"

"Yes, what is your name?"

"My name is Liu Qinghua. Are you hiring clerks here?"

"That's right. We welcome Mr. Liu to apply, but we haven't met before. According to our rules, we should test Mr. Liu."

"Of course, of course."

After a written test and an oral test, one of the young men went outside and called in a large man in a suit. The large man claimed to be the general manager of Dasheng Enterprise Company. After looking at Liu Qinghua's written test, he said very politely:

"Mr. Liu certainly has considerable experience in clerical work. I admire it very much! Our company's business has been very prosperous recently. This time, we plan to recruit eight clerks to handle all the company's paperwork. This temporary office is about to close. We have already rented a large Western-style house on Huanlong Road, and we will move there to work in five days."

Liu Qinghua realized that he was a bit incoherent because he said a lot of things, but he didn't say what he wanted to say. That sentence was: had Liu Qinghua been hired? So he simply asked him directly.

"Then after looking at my written test, you can certainly know whether I have a chance of being hired?"

"Does that even need to be said?" The large man patted him on the shoulder: "Of course you're hired, of course you're hired. The salary is temporarily set at 200,000 yuan, and it will be increased soon. We also have year-end bonuses here. The amount of the bonus is very considerable. Last year, each employee of our company received a 12-month bonus. For example, if your salary, Mr. Liu, is 200,000 yuan, you can receive a bonus of 2.4 million yuan at the end of the year. This year, our company's profits will probably be even higher than last year, so the amount of the bonus will naturally increase accordingly."

"Then when do I start working at the company?"

"It's best to come tomorrow," the large man said with great concern. "When you come tomorrow, please bring 3 million yuan in cash."

"Why?" He was very surprised.

"All of our employees are required to pay a cash deposit."

"Can't I use a guarantor?"

"No, this is our company's rules for hiring people. The rules cannot be changed casually."

Although the large man's words were very beautiful, experience told him that this was a well-planned performance. If he didn't need 3 million yuan, he might even try it to broaden his horizons, even if it was a waste of time and energy. But where could he find 3 million yuan?

On the way back, his heart was as heavy as a lead stone...

### Flying Together (81)

— Zhao Qingge

The Zhili-Fengtian War broke out!

As a result, all industries were shut down, and people fled to other places. The entire troupe from the theater where Lihua was working, led by Zhang Xian, fled to the Central China area to perform as a traveling troupe. Naturally, Lihua couldn't leave this organization. Mrs. Mo, as well as Liyun, also joined Zhang Xian's troupe. They took the Jinpu train to Xuzhou. They stopped there and signed a six-month contract with a theater owner.

This was the first page of Guanghua's nomadic career as a performer.

Changing to a new environment inevitably brings some new troubles. As the "star" of the troupe, Guan Hua couldn't help but socialize with local people, which is called "paying respects to the local bosses." If you don't do this in this business, there will be a lot of trouble. Lihua had to grit her teeth and deal with it. She began to feel that performing was not simple, and being a star was even more difficult. She used to only know that performing was just fulfilling an obligation, and there was nothing else besides the obligation. Now she realized that in addition to the "obligation," there was also a responsibility - the responsibility of social relationships. This added a lot of pain to Lihua. She could maintain her dignity with her colleagues; with Zhang Xian; and even with Mrs. Mo; but she couldn't maintain her dignity with social people in a new environment - warlords; officials; gentry; celebrities; rich and powerful masters! She had to be humble and respectful to these people; she had to flatter and boast to these people; she had to be obsequious and ingratiating to these people; she had to talk and laugh with these people! Even though she herself didn't directly express it this way, Zhang Xian and Mrs. Mo would express it for her. She was like a beggar fallen into a foreign land, stretching out her hand; bending her knees; asking these people for food! And she was asking for food for many people! Although she felt that it was even more humiliating than performing, she could only "close her eyes" and endure it!

In Xuzhou, Lihua was still very popular, as red as the "stars in the sky"! So red that many masters were fascinated by her, the old ones wanted to recognize her as a goddaughter, and the young ones wanted to make friends with her. What "recognizing as a goddaughter"? What "making friends"? They just wanted to take the opportunity to get close to her.

### Homesickness

— Ling Yu

It's been half a year since I left Northern Jiangsu.

In the past six months, our family has been separated in three places. Whenever I see the bright, half-moon night, it really makes me remember Bai Juyi's poem "One night of homesickness in five places at the same time."

War makes people wander, brings people to the brink of despair, and makes people's hearts even more restless and desolate. Whenever I see another group of people coming out of the tragic situation in Northern Jiangsu, I really can't believe that China is still one of the "Five Powers" and that China still has "great citizens."

Slowly, my homesickness has only become disillusionment.

These past two days have been the plum rain season. In the place where I'm staying, the croaking of frogs comes from far and near every evening, as if it were a scene of lying on a rattan mat in my own home, looking up at the Milky Way. But I'm sitting on a bamboo stool borrowed from a neighbor, and next to me is a ruined wall bombed by the enemy eight years ago! Looking into the distance, all I see are dilapidated walls, with no neat houses anywhere. The south wind blows, sometimes carrying a nauseating musty smell. It is said that many young men and women were buried alive by the Japanese devils in the nearby piles of broken tiles. This is a small city that has suffered the most from enemy destruction.

When I see this scene of broken walls and ruins, how can I not feel infinite homesickness for the distant plains of Northern Jiangsu?

Yesterday, I received a letter from my wife. She told me that she was in another city, struggling to survive with two children amidst high prices. She said, "It's so hot, and I have to take care of the two children every step of the way..." She also said, "Six months of exile after the victory feels like adding six more years of suffering from the occupation." Attached to the end of the letter were two lines written by my eight-year-old child. The child wrote, "Daddy, are you doing well outside? Do you miss home, miss the peaches on the peach tree in our garden?"

When I read these two lines, I couldn't help but have tears well up in my eyes. The child's innocent words moved me. Yes, I really miss home. Because of the child's call, I thought of the peach tree in the garden behind my house. It was an improved variety of honey peach transplanted from a farm in Dingjia. For the past four years, it has always been full of fruit in May. The child cherished it and was reluctant to give it away easily, unless it was to his favorite elders and his little friends. But this year, just when the peaches were bearing fruit, we all left the old house where we had lived for nearly thirty years and a small garden.

What words should I pick up my pen to comfort my child with? But in the end I wrote: "Child, we can go home soon. If you want to eat peaches, ask Mom to buy them for you!" I knew that this sentence was a deception to the innocent child. I knew that the flames of war would not be extinguished.

Thinking of this, my heart became even heavier, but I sincerely prayed for the realization of true peace, and a strong longing homesickness surged up again!

One should see a beautiful painting, listen to some music, and read some poetry in one's daily life. — Goethe

The purpose of music is to inspire and ennoble the soul. — Morales

### Yearning for Green

— Hu Shuo

Living in a big city, what I see every day are densely packed, beehive-like skyscrapers, gray cement ground, smoke-like dust mixed with fine coal particles, and the thousands upon thousands of heads of people moving around... What I hear are car horns and the clamor of people. Every morning, leaning by the window of a high-rise building, I open my eyes and look out at the distant sky, wanting to find some green from the distant places to moisten my long-parched soul, but the taller, more gigantic beast-like buildings cruelly cover the eyes of the dream-seeker with gray shadows. The long years pass slowly like a heavy iron wheel, and hope, longing, and yearning are glued to the iron teeth of this wheel, crushed into a bright red streak of blood!...

How tiring is city life! The beast-like buildings, the gray smoke, and the gray cement ground... People can never see that green field. On the outskirts of this city lies the turbid river water, stretching like a belt to the distant horizon, cutting off the traveler's reverie. Living narrowly in the beehive-like buildings every day, cherishing the news of the homeland, yearning for the familiar, boundless green; the lush pines and cypresses, the graceful willows, and the soft fragrant grass. Sometimes my thoughts are disturbed by pain, and occasionally I sneak out of my small room, walk out of the building, and walk alone to the riverbank, standing tall on the shore, hoping to see a pile of clouds from my distant homeland floating in with the evening breeze, but the groaning and sobbing of the river water pulls the traveler back from memory, piercing my soul like many sharp needles!

In the encirclement of loneliness and depression, I spent a series of days, almost every day, and often, I yearned for the green of the distant fields, and for the sake of the yearning for green, in a dim midnight with drizzle falling like dog fur, I quietly wiped away the hot tears that rolled down from the corners of my eyes with a handkerchief.

When I was young, I flew around like a swallow, from this city to that city. Those ten years left a precious page in my life. Every year's vacation was arranged for travelers to change their living environment. When city life became boring, I would flap my wings and start flying again, flying to my homeland and throwing myself into the embrace of the fields, kissing that green land! Lush green, graceful green, soft green... giving me a feeling of peace and tranquility, engraving beautiful and warm lines in the depths of my soul, and drawing a quiet and beautiful picture around me. But I never thought that one day, the green would fade away from my side, leaving behind a trace of blurriness and disappointment.

The torch of war was lit in every corner of the ancient land, and the blood of millions of innocent people converged into a red wave, seeping into the fields of the motherland. The green homeland, like the corners of the north, south, east, and west, disappeared from the side of everyone who yearned for green in the midst of the smell of gunpowder, losing its peaceful, solemn, warm, and quiet beauty. With blurriness and disappointment, I bid farewell to my parents, wife, and children, reluctantly walked out of my old home, stepping on the fragrant grass, passing through the pines and cypresses, and flew to the distance like a swallow again, but from that time on, the swallow's wings became heavy, losing the lightness and agility of youth, and from that time on, leaving my homeland meant several years.

Eight years of turmoil, sleeping in the wind and dew, crossing mountains and wading through water, stumbling in the wind and sand, wandering from one unfamiliar town to another unfamiliar city. The wanderer endured a long series of years wrapped in pain and sorrow, and traveled a desert journey in the dark night.

During this time, I dreamed of silk-colored dreams every day, hoping that one day I could lie in the embrace of the fields, kissing that green chest wildly, washing away her bloody wounds with my sincere tears! Healing her wounds of trampling!

Finally, dawn came, and cries of victory flew everywhere. Facing the morning sun, dragging my tired and heavy steps, the wanderer came to this familiar metropolis again. When I carefully brushed off the dust from my clothes for the first time, I felt an unspeakable joy in my heart. Eight long years have passed, and tears of excitement hung down with a smile. The green memories began to flicker in front of me.

I want to rush to the fields!

But the fog after dawn blocked my eyes, and a storm broke the weary wings of the swallow. A letter from home came from afar, telling me that my old home had been destroyed four years ago, and the story of murder continues to be staged in the fields; that is an even more cruel human tragedy! My family is fine, and all three children are growing up very well, but on the field, which is covered with new and old wounds and faded green, they are living a life that is getting worse and worse, and living more painfully. ...

I don't understand what kind of cruel tragedy is continuing?

Hope was crushed to pieces, and sorrow and pain filled my emotions. Wrapped in deeper wounds, I lifted my steps and left.

The yearning for green gnawed at my soul like a poisonous snake, and my heart was like a yellow, withered leaf. With the erosion of wind and rain, the deep thirst seemed to sink into the mire again.

But, living in the small room of the beehive-like skyscrapers in the city, treading on the gray cement ground, in a ceaseless clamor of noise, where can you find the nourishment of silk green!

### Rice Weevils

— Shao Fu

Foreigners invented DDT, but the Chinese have another ingenious use for it: suicide. This is beyond the inventor's expectations. One brother said: Even suicide has to use foreign goods, it's really disheartening!

In all matters, Shanghai people are indeed the first to catch the trend. Having DDT suicide is also fashionable. To date, two such news items have appeared in the newspapers. One has already passed away, and the other only said that he was in critical condition. How the story goes on is still unknown. DDT kills mosquitoes, insects, fleas, and lice, and it turns out that it can also kill people.

Speaking of killing insects, DDT has one unexpected result. It is helpless against one type of insect: the rice weevil.

I have a friend who is particularly interested in biology. In order to test the killing power of DDT, he specially collected bedbugs, mosquitoes, fleas, lice, centipedes, millipedes, crickets, earthworms, rice weevils... various insects, and used DDT to spray them. Under the spraying, all the insects immediately stopped moving, were dying, and gradually died. My friend did not throw them away, but left them there to see what would happen the next day.

The next day, when he went to look again, all the insects were dead, except for the rice weevils, which were wriggling in the corpses of these insects, probably looking for something to eat, and looked particularly energetic. It seemed to be saying: What can you do to me?

This is my friend's report, an absolutely true report. If you don't believe it, fortunately, these two days are the plum rain season, and there are plenty of rice weevils. Everyone can try it out for themselves!

### Also Talking About Inferiority

— Mo Yu

After reading the articles about "inferiority" in this column the past two days, I couldn't help but think of the "inferiority" felt by subordinates towards superiors. I would like to add something to what Mr. You Ting said:

A person is not born with a sense of inferiority. If you look at young people, nineteen out of ten have the naive energy of a newborn calf who thinks highly of himself. However, this naive energy, after entering society, has to be automatically adjusted and corrected due to various setbacks. Mr. You Ting blames parents in the family for the development of inferiority. In fact, no parents do not deeply love their children and feel comforted when their children can be proud. It's just that the parents, being experienced, know that no level in society allows you to start from "inferiority." Therefore, they cannot help but try to suppress their children from succumbing to "inferiority" through admonishment and guidance. Zeng Guofan's earnest family letters to his children are also his bitter experiences from climbing up to the capital court from the Xiang Army militia. He knew that society only allows inferior people to stand, so even though he was a first-rank official, he still had to learn "inferiority." In his later years, after achieving success, he occasionally satirized Zuo Zongtang in a few casual remarks, and historians wrote about him: "Generous and tolerant, how can you not be ashamed of your virtues." Even if you have contributed greatly to saving the country, you still have to be "inferior," otherwise you will lose your "demeanor" and not understand the principles of being a person!

I remember when I was about to leave school, several former classmates kindly advised me on the secret of using "inferiority" to gain the favor of superiors. After I started working, I always felt that this was invaluable advice. If you are naive and a little憨, you will simply encounter countless hard and soft nails every day. Superiors are all-powerful. Even if they have something they don't understand or are slightly embarrassed about and come to ask you, you must not directly and frankly stand up and accept it. You must be flattered and apprehensive, expressing that you didn't really understand or know how to do it, but you will do your best to be loyal to this matter. After completing the task, you still have to pretend to be sweating profusely but afraid of not being perfect, and ask for instructions. The superior knows that this is deliberately mystifying, but he will definitely appreciate your bowing and subservient inferior expression. You can therefore gain favor, and the superior may even find you to chat and play chess when he has free time. Then you must always pay attention and be inferior everywhere, because an inferior person can highlight how brilliant and knowledgeable your superior is.

I really like the scene of officers in the army punishing soldiers. When the officer shouts, "You muddled-headed bastard!" the soldiers must respond loudly and with chest puffed out: "Yes, Sir!" This is no longer "inferiority," it is loyalty, obedience, and politeness. "Inferiority" has been sublimated here. This kind of inferiority is sincere, not hypocritical, and humane!

People without money and power all have to be inferior. Mr. You Ting says this is a serious psychological illness, but I think it should be said that it is a serious social illness.

Writing to here, I recalled the last time an American private first class visited their Secretary of the Army in Shanghai. The private first class was able to see the Secretary, and the Secretary was able to shake hands with him. Both had the courage to state and listen. I'm really a little envious.

### Electronic Blanket

— Zhiwei

Many electronic devices have been invented in the field of electronic science. However, those that are convenient for daily life are still few and far between. Recently, Siemens in the United States invented an electronic blanket, which has been successfully tested and will be produced in large quantities. Each blanket costs 40 US dollars. This item was introduced in the spring of 1946. The blanket is divided into two layers, with two intertwined wires in the middle: one to conduct electricity to heat the blanket, and the other to connect to a three-tube temperature regulator to measure the temperature in the blanket and adjust it. If the needle of the regulator points to 78 degrees and the room temperature drops, the temperature-sensing wire can cause a large amount of current to pass through, thereby heating the blanket. If the room temperature increases, the blanket can automatically lower the temperature to the standard 78 degrees. When a person's body temperature drops slightly at night, the blanket can automatically increase the temperature, thus avoiding the trouble of adding blankets due to catching a cold at night. The electronic blanket is very light, so it can make people sleep soundly, and it can also preheat the bed, which is truly good news for those who are afraid of getting into a cold bed in winter.

The effectiveness of this electronic blanket can be proven by the following two tests: 1. If it is illuminated by multiple electric lamps, the heat of the blanket will greatly increase, but through the action of the regulator, it can still maintain the normal temperature of 78 degrees, and the current consumption is only 10 watts. 2. If the blanket is covered with ice, the temperature will greatly decrease, but through the action of the regulator, the temperature inside the blanket will automatically rise to 78 degrees, but the current consumption will reach 198 watts.

Although the electronic blanket uses electric current to heat, it is tightly installed, so there is no danger of electric shock. It is lightweight, comfortable, and unparalleled.

### Freckles and Vitality

— Zhong Sheng

Many young ladies, when they are very young, will widen their eyes and say to the mirror:

"Oh, how annoying, so many freckles!" This article is written for young ladies with freckles.

Empresses and concubines used morning dew to smear their faces, and old-fashioned beauticians prescribed saltpeter and glycerin. In the era of our mothers, they used rose water mixed with borax and washed in sour milk.

However, modern scientists tell us that freckles are something we should be proud of and take pride in! Dr. Guo Lunhai, a famous Irish gynecologist, said: "Women should not be ashamed of having freckles, they should feel happy. Freckles are a sign of vitality and a kind of sexual attraction." How could Dr. Guo Lunhai know so much about freckles? Here is a peculiar story. Many of Dr. Guo's patients happened to have many freckles, and the children born to women with freckles were always particularly strong and beautiful. He discovered that if a woman stopped childbearing, she would also stop producing freckles. He also noticed that the older a woman got, the fewer freckles she had. Old ladies never have freckles, although when they were young, their faces might have been covered with freckles. Dr. Guo's conclusion is only the beginning of the study of freckles, and now it can be undoubtedly proven. Women with freckles have much more vitality than women with lily-white faces!

Recently, we often hear about a substance extracted from female hormones that can be used to make anti-aging creams. It is sometimes used in high-end cosmetics. This sex hormone can be found in large quantities in the bodies of women with freckles.

It is commonly said that redheads are the most active lovers, but modern science says that what pleases men is not red hair but freckles. The color of a woman's hair, whether silver, gold, or black, is unimportant, contrary to general opinion. What matters most is whether or not they have freckles.

Many people have freckles, but you don't suspect that they do. Some people have freckles, but they are not visible to the naked eye. In ophthalmology, freckles that are not normally visible become fully visible under ultraviolet light or shortwave violet light.

Joan Crawford was a freckled little thing in her youth, and Myrna Loy also had freckles. Katharine Hepburn and Jeanette MacDonald are also like that. Besides, May Valli and Chimay Storwah are also freckled faces. President Roosevelt had freckles, and Mrs. Roosevelt had a freckled face when she was a girl. Mrs. Roosevelt said that this is one of the reasons why she became ugly.

Another strange thing: people who have freckles must have a very rich supply of vitamin C in their tissues. American government scientists set up a test station in Maryland, and the results proved that vitamin C is closely related to sexual energy. They tested cows and bulls, but they believe that men and women are the same. (Translated from the Saturday Family Weekly)

"To a captive of love"

XX:

I finished reading the two letters you sent in one breath. From these two different letters, I found that you two grew up in two completely foreign worlds. The bridge of love doesn't seem to be able to connect you. One is a self-proclaimed "Nora" figure, with lofty, arrogant, and conceited intentions, wanting to play well on the stage of life and win a few cheers from the audience; the other is a newborn calf, seeing a green, naive, optimistic, curious, and pure world in front of him, but with some childishness.

From these two different personalities, I can't see the possibility of coordination. If you don't mind me speaking frankly, it's best to get rid of her thoughts as soon as possible.

As she said, we who study engineering should be rich in rationality. We should be able to pick up, put down, and get rid of anything. One of the common problems we often make is: once we fall in love with something, whether it is a person or a thing, we feel that there is nothing better in the world. This is because our knowledge is limited and our vision is narrow. You live at the foot of Nanshan Mountain every day, and what you see every day is limited to the insects, trees, flowers, and birds on Nanshan Mountain. You will naturally feel that all the beauty in the world is in Nanshan Mountain. If you are willing to travel to more places and make more friends, you will not be able to help but laugh at yourself. How inferior your previous tastes seem to be! The things you used to be so fascinated with, when measured by today's standards, are far from the level. Maurois said a word: "Run away from the place that gives you pain, and your pain will slowly heal." So I agree with your idea of running around to different places. First, out of sight, pain can be slowly diluted by time; second, it can also increase a lot of knowledge.

Some stimulation in life is good. With stimulation, inner potential is stimulated. Life should also have some things left undone, and some things that are hung high and cannot be obtained. Only in this way can there be hope and an object of effort. If everything is achieved smoothly, and everything is obtained satisfactorily, the feeling that follows is the disappointment of "but that's all there is to it." Only things that are obtained after struggle taste sweeter and sweeter. The more disappointed and frustrated we are, the more we should seek to be open-minded. Wasn't the young Goethe in love everywhere? However, when he saw his lover sinking like the sun in the west, he turned back to appreciate the rising bright moon in the east. We should learn from Goethe's spirit. Let what is going to be lost go, why mourn the old love with a sad face?

To be honest, she rejects you because she looks down on you for always smiling and not having the masculinity of a husband. There is no reason why she is proud of you. A person who can be proud and dares to be proud must have something extraordinary. Your letter says: "She is becoming more and more active every day, writing editorials for newspapers and articles for various magazines. I am still silently fiddling with my machine." If you are willing to be silent, she will of course not look up to you. Friend, if you feel that you are inferior to her, you don't need to sigh; from today on, you still have time to work hard. It is useless to envy others for making progress while you are not making progress. Only by using your own progress to balance the progress of others can you control things and always be the master, not the slave. Life is most afraid of mediocrity, stagnation, and lack of success. If you can create "surprise" every day, how dare others look down on you? As long as you have achievements, maybe you still have a chance to reconcile. If you can't do it, you will definitely gain a lot of new progress in the process of your efforts and secretly taste the joy of struggle. In the end, your efforts will gain surpassing achievements in other aspects, your taste will change, your vision will become higher, and the wound will have been smoothed over by time. When you look back, look at her who is far behind you, then you will be able to say contentedly, "Look! How am I today?"

Friend, we must live the life of a strong person, we must not be weak! Weakness is a sin, a theft of heaven's nature, and a waste of food for people who are useful to live. In front of people who despise us, we must take action. As long as we seize the present and work hard, then every tomorrow, you will find yourself better than yesterday. "Let the dead past bury its dead." Start from now and work hard!

### A Fishing Story

— Ting

A London magazine, "The Spectator," published a short essay. The psychological state of the four powers jointly administering Germany can be seen from a story:

"One day, a Soviet, a Frenchman, an American, and an Englishman were visiting a goldfish bowl. While they were enjoying it with great interest, four goldfish suddenly jumped out of the bowl. Seeing this, the Soviet immediately stepped on one of the goldfish and killed it. The Frenchman immediately squatted down, picked up one of them, put it in his bag, and took it home to cook for dinner. The American was completely unmoved and simply ignored it. But what about the Englishman? He picked up the fourth goldfish, very gently wiped off the dust, put it back in the bowl, and then changed the water in the bowl."

### Puyi's Crime

— Feifei

Puyi, the puppet emperor of the puppet Manchukuo, has reportedly completed the extradition procedures and is scheduled to be transported from Vladivostok to Shanghai around the 20th of this month, and then escorted from Shanghai to Beijing by military aircraft to be tried as an important war criminal.

Puyi was a puppet emperor in the Northeast for 14 years. For 14 years, he always followed the lead of the enemy chiefs Hirohito and the Kwantung Army, placing the people of the Northeast in dire straits. Under the policy of enslavement education, young people around the age of 20 would not know their motherland, and children around the age of 10 had never seen rice. It was against the law for Chinese people in the Northeast to eat rice.

If they were occasionally caught stealing rice, the punishment they received was more severe than that of Shanghai people smoking opium; but Japanese people eating rice was not subject to this rule, because they were conquerors. There was only one way for Chinese people to be free from interference by the invaders, and that was to sell opium and smoke opium.

Although Puyi was a puppet emperor, he was the number one puppet of the puppet Manchukuo. For example, in the palace, he could only smoke Japanese cigarettes. The Japanese warlords forbade him to smoke the British and American Three Five brand cigarettes. He and the Japanese warlords still colluded and acted as accomplices in many important tasks.

If a public opinion survey were conducted in the Northeast today, asking the people of the Northeast for their opinions on the disposal of Puyi, all the people of the Northeast might ask the government to execute Puyi by slicing or beheading him; because Puyi and the Japanese warlords used this method to deal with the volunteer army in the Northeast in the past. If we use their methods to treat them in turn, Puyi would certainly deserve it. Unfortunately, China no longer has this kind of punishment.

The execution of the puppet emperor is an inevitable matter sooner or later. I will first use this article to mourn the puppet emperor!

### Sent to My Deceased Wife, Fengjun (3)

— Zhou Shoujuan

One day, the beloved daughter of Brother Xiaoqing, Yu Zhen, who works in Shanghai, returned to Suzhou for some business, and she and her mother came to the hospital to visit you. Miss Yu Zhen is a devout Christian, so she earnestly persuaded you to believe in Christ, saying that only Christ can cure your illness and save your life. I had not yet arrived at the hospital at that time, and you were unwilling to make your own decision, saying that you needed my consent. Alas, Feng, you are too stubborn! If Christ could really cure your illness and save your life, would I disagree? So as soon as I arrived at the hospital, after hearing about this, I immediately agreed to believe in Christianity, and even made a vow that after I had buried my old mother, who had believed in Buddhism all her life, I would follow you and become a follower of Christ. What a good Miss Yu Zhen, she was busy kneeling down to pray for you, which moved me very much. Afterwards, I often used Christ to encourage you to maintain your faith, believing that Christ would definitely protect you. However, half a month later, Dr. Huang said that injecting air was not very effective, so it was better to go home and recuperate. I couldn't help but feel secretly disappointed when I heard this, but you looked happy, because on the one hand, you couldn't bear the pain of the injections, and on the other hand, you were eager to go home, thinking that the hospital was not as comfortable as home. I had no choice but to pay the bill and accompany you home with a heavy heart.

After returning home, I still asked Dr. Wu to come every other day to give you those three kinds of injections. I heard that the mixed vitamin from Parke, Davis & Company in the United States was very beneficial to the sick body, so I wrote a express letter to Zheng'er in Shanghai to buy a hundred pills and take one or two doses every day. And I kept buying oranges, milk powder, and other nutritious things for you to eat. I knew that you had always been frugal, so I earnestly advised you not to worry about my source of income. I had plenty of money on hand, and you could buy whatever you wanted. You wanted to eat candied dates, you wanted to eat raisins, you wanted to eat pickled vegetables. I searched all over Guanqian Street and managed to buy them. I brought them back excitedly and put them in your hands, but you only ate two candied dates, a few raisins, and said they were too sweet and greasy. After eating a piece of pickled vegetable, you said it was too salty and spicy, and put them all aside. I watched you at every meal and always advised you to eat more. You smiled bitterly and never wanted to eat more, but you couldn't eat it. Probably the amount you were going to eat in this life was almost full? I stopped you from saying these unlucky words, and you stopped talking. Poor me, I tried every means to make you have enough nutrition, to use it as a weapon to resist the disease; however, whether it was giving you eggs, soy milk, or beef juice, you always didn't want to eat any more after a few days. Even other things you loved to eat, such as shrimp, abalone, white chicken, and sauced duck, you often tasted only a little and stopped. You frowned and said, "I don't know what has blocked my appetite. Why don't I feel much flavor in anything I eat?"

You have always loved cleanliness. When you were in Shanghai, although you went in and out of the kitchen, you were still neatly dressed. Now, even though you are sick, you still want to maintain your clean state. Although you have no strength yourself, you always have to struggle to get up every morning, ask Aunt Bao to comb your hair, make the bed, and tidy up the bedding. Taking this opportunity, I would help you to the corridor and lean on the rattan chair for half an hour to absorb some fresh air and indirectly get some sunlight. When you were in the mood, I had to help you to see the thriving flowers and trees, and you were willing and happy to do so.

The tenth day of the third lunar month was your 50th birthday. My children and I all valued this day very much. We planned to celebrate it for you and hoped that after this day, your health would improve day by day. The day before, Zheng'er really came back from Shanghai with your four sisters, Ling, Mei, Xing, and Ying, your cousin Zhao Xi, Mei's son Xin Tai, Xing's husband Junqing, and son Pingsheng, a total of nine people. Only your daughter-in-law Yundai was six months pregnant and about to give birth, and Mei's husband Jingren was busy with his clinic, so they couldn't come. You watched all your children sincerely return to wish you a happy birthday, and they all offered gifts, clothes and food, piled on your bed, which made you so happy that you shed tears. The next morning, we all mobilized to decorate the hall, hanging a large longevity character painted with meticulous brushwork of flowers and plants in the middle, offering copper candlesticks, copper incense burners, and a new type of candlestick that could hold seven candles. The gardener presented a large red candle and longevity incense, and lit them all together with the seven red candles. In the center of the table, there were longevity noodles presented by Ms. Xu Xiuzhen of Jinghai Women's Normal School and a longevity cake that your daughter-in-law asked Zheng'er to present on her behalf. On the long offering tables on both sides, there were antique bronzes, which actually looked like a hall. In order to show solemnity, I had asked Su You to order a table of shark fin soup a few days ago. At noon, the whole family sat around the round table and invited Ms. Xu to participate, which was really full of joy. You sat in the middle, and your eyebrows also showed a very happy expression. This meal was very rich. Although you couldn't eat much, I insisted that you try everything, and I also brought the homemade rose flower wine to the table, and you reluctantly took a sip. Everyone looked at it and was very excited. You didn't want to spoil our fun, and only went to bed to rest after the meal was over. In the afternoon, you still ate noodles and cake as usual, and you ate some too. Although this birthday did not alarm friends, it was considered to have fully fulfilled the two words "family celebration." However, because you were sick yourself, you did not allow anyone to bow to you, which made your children feel sorry for you.

### Curfew and Martial Law

— Hong Yin

After the curfew was lifted, the authorities declared that martial law would not be lifted. Many people are confused, asking what the difference is between the two.

Actually, it's very simple: a curfew specifically refers to the prohibition of movement at night (in Shanghai, it begins after midnight). It is one of the means of implementing martial law. As for a martial law order, it can be declared at any time depending on the actual needs, because it is not limited to nighttime alone.

Do you understand now?
