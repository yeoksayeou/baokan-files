### Government Representatives Offer Opinions on the Convening of the National Assembly

[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 17th] The Political Consultative Conference held its seventh meeting at 3:00 PM on the 17th to discuss the issue of the National Assembly. Government representatives, including Sun Ke and eight others, presented their opinions on the National Assembly, which were explained by Zhang Lisheng. Zhang Bojun, Deng Yingchao, Zhang Dongsun, Wu Yuzhang, Zhang Junmai, Zeng Qi, Wang Yunwu, Qian Xinzhi, Shao Congen, Hu Lin, Guo Moruo, Fu Sinian, Shao Lizi, and others spoke successively, and all were submitted to a subcommittee for summarization and negotiation.

[Chongqing, Associated Press, 17th] At today's meeting of the Political Consultative Conference, government and Communist Party representatives could not agree on various proposals for convening the National Assembly on May 5th to end political tutelage and implement constitutional government. Later, the Communist Party formally put forward ten points on the process of national construction. Zhang Lisheng, representing the government, said that he hoped to convene the National Assembly to end one-party rule and return power to the people without further delay. He also requested that the second National Assembly be convened within six months to pass the constitution, and that representatives to the assembly should be elected according to the constitution.

[Chongqing, This Newspaper, 16th] Zhang Shenfu said at the conference that the Party had harmed China greatly. Shao Lizi rose and spoke in a gentle tone, first pointing out that the people are currently living in hardship and the nation is facing difficulties. While the Party knows that its efforts have been insufficient, without the organization of the Tongmenghui by the Party, the Manchu Qing Dynasty could not have been overthrown; without the reorganization of the Party and the Northern Expedition, the Northern Warlords could not have been eliminated, and the country could not have been unified. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, without the leadership of the Party, victory could not have been achieved, and the state today would be unimaginable. How can one make a distorted interpretation that turns black and white upside down, completely negating the achievements of the Party? He asked everyone to speak fairly.

[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 17th] The eighth meeting of the Political Consultative Conference is scheduled to be held at 9:00 AM on the 18th, with the agenda being the draft constitution. In addition, the policy program group of the Political Consultative Conference will meet at the Supreme National Defense Council at 9:00 AM on the 17th, and the government organization group will meet at the Senate at 10:00 AM.

Three-Person Group to Discuss Reorganizing Communist Party Troops

[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 17th] Regarding the Military Affairs Three-Person Group meeting, after Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek appointed Minister Zhang Zhizhong and Chairman Zhang Qun as representatives of the Military Affairs Commission on the government side, they began talks with Communist Party representative Zhou Enlai at Minister Zhang's residence at 4:00 PM on the 15th, holding preliminary and broad discussions on the reorganization of the Communist Party troops. However, due to Minister Zhang feeling slightly unwell, he will rest for a day or two on doctor's orders before continuing specific discussions.

[Chongqing, This Newspaper, 16th] Regarding the number of troops in the future, the Youth Party advocates reducing the number to 120 divisions this year and 60 divisions next year. The Democratic League advocates reducing the number to the greatest extent possible. Lin Wei reported on the government's plan to reduce the number to 90 divisions this year. Zeng Qi expressed his gratification, but Zhou Enlai believed that it would not be easy to reduce such a large number of troops, and that the CCP should retain at least 26 divisions in accordance with the Double Tenth Agreement. He also said that the army can only be mobilized after the national reorganization is completed and the constitutional government is fully realized.

[Chongqing, This Newspaper, 16th] At the sixth meeting, the Youth Party and the Democratic League's proposals on the nationalization of the army were discussed. After Chen Qitian and Liang Shuming described the original proposals separately, the chairman asked Lin Wei of the Ministry of Military Administration to report on the National Army's reorganization plan and implementation process. One-third of the National Army was reorganized last year, and the reorganization will continue. Zhang Qun reported that the three-person group had begun work, discussing the Communist army plan, striving to realize the nationalization of the army, and explaining that the Kuomintang would withdraw from the army. Zhou Enlai also agreed with the separation of party and army, making the original proposal lose its meaning, so the discussion was limited to minor issues. Zeng Qi expressed his gratification, saying that if the military issue is resolved, the political issue can also be resolved. If the political issue is resolved, then politics will be on the right track, the future of this conference is very optimistic, and the future of the country is infinitely bright.

### Zhang Lisheng Explains Orally: The Assembly Will Be Held on May 5th as Scheduled, to Enact the Constitution and Determine the Date of Its Implementation, with a Reasonable Increase in the Number of Representatives Beyond Those Already Elected

[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 17th] At the seventh meeting of the Political Consultative Conference, Member Zhang Lisheng explained the government representatives' "Opinions on the National Assembly" as follows: Chairman, esteemed members. Today's agenda is to discuss the National Assembly issue. The government representatives have put forward four opinions, the wording of which is quite simple, so I would like to make an oral report on some of the meanings for the reference of the conference in its deliberations.

(1) To convene the National Assembly on May 5, 1946. Our founding father advocated building the country with the Three Principles of the People, and the stage of "political tutelage" is the most important in the process of national construction. However, the "political tutelage" period is based on the law of the Chinese Kuomintang, which is entrusted by the people to exercise political power. In the past few years, the government and the ruling Kuomintang have wanted to complete the work that should be done during the period of political tutelage, namely local self-government, as soon as possible, and then return power to the people. Unfortunately, during the process of political tutelage, the country suffered many misfortunes and setbacks. In the past eight or nine years, it has encountered an unprecedented national crisis, which has led to the postponement of the National Assembly, which was decided to be convened in 1937. At this time, the War of Resistance began. In order to strive for national survival and victory in the War of Resistance, the convening of the National Assembly had to be delayed. Fortunately, although many dangers were experienced in the eight years, final victory was achieved, which should be attributed to the consistent sacrifice and hard work of the people throughout the country and the armed soldiers at the front lines. Tracing the fundamental element of victory, it still relies on the leadership of a great leader who is arduous, indomitable, and tenacious. Today, the War of Resistance has been won, and the National Government has been established for nearly 20 years. The people of the whole country have a universal understanding and deep belief in the Three Principles of the People created by our founding father, and the country has achieved independence, freedom, and equality. However, having independence, freedom, and equality requires the people of the whole country to strive for self-improvement and have the strength to guarantee independence, freedom, and equality in order to stand tall in the world. In view of this, the government wants to return power to the people as soon as possible and place the responsibility of building the country in the future on the shoulders of all the people. Therefore, the National Assembly must be convened on May 5th of this year.

(2) The powers of the first National Assembly are to enact the constitution. The powers of this National Assembly are to enact the constitution and decide the date of implementation of the constitution, as we have explained. The National Assembly in the Five-Power Constitution is the highest political organ of the state. The representatives of the National Assembly have the power to elect, recall, initiate, and referendum on central politics. The powers of this National Assembly are only to enact the constitution, that is to say, this National Assembly does not exercise the powers stipulated in the constitution. In other words, it cannot elect government officials and exercise the three powers of administrative recall, initiation, and referendum. We feel that this should be the case from the stage of political tutelage to the beginning of constitutional government.

(3) In addition to those already elected, the remaining number of representatives to the first National Assembly can be reasonably increased. The reason for reasonably increasing the number of representatives other than those already elected is that after more than eight years of the War of Resistance, people from all walks of life throughout the country have a deep understanding of political experience and the way to build the country in the future, and have an urgent demand. Therefore, this National Assembly should gather ideas from all sources, accommodate more capable, insightful, and enthusiastic people for the country, and contribute more of their abilities to this National Assembly.

(4) The second National Assembly shall be elected and convened within six months of the promulgation of the constitution, in accordance with the provisions of the constitution. The so-called second National Assembly refers to the National Assembly stipulated in the constitution that will be convened on May 5th of this year to enact and announce the constitution. It is hoped that it will be elected and convened within six months in accordance with the provisions of the constitution. This point needs to be specially explained. We know that there is a view in society that there are many opinions on the validity of the representatives of the first National Assembly. Some views hold that the representatives of the first National Assembly who have already been elected should be re-elected. Our government and the ruling party also attach great importance to this view and have considered it. However, after our consideration, there is no reason not to recognize the qualifications of the representatives who have already been elected in accordance with the law in the past. There are two reasons: one is based on legal principles, and the other is based on reason and the current political situation. First, from the first point, we cannot find a basis in law. We look at the National Assembly Organization Law amended and promulgated on May 21, 1937, which has two articles. The first article is that the National Assembly formulates the constitution and decides the date of implementation of the constitution. Article 11 is that the National Assembly ends its term when its task is completed. According to these two provisions, the powers of the National Assembly are to formulate the constitution and decide the date of implementation of the constitution. The representatives of the National Assembly only have this task and no term of office. The government has no legal basis to remove them from this task. Secondly, from the second point, looking at the general trend in politics today, what the country hopes for is unity and unification, and to seek national stability from unity and unification. All of you here are also here to hold a consultative conference in order to seek unity and unification and national stability. Suppose the government or any party does not recognize the qualifications of the nine hundred and something representatives who have already been elected in accordance with the law in the past, and re-elects them. May I ask what those hundreds of representatives will think and how they will react? It should be noted that these representatives are elected from various localities and occupational groups, and we cannot say that they do not represent the will of the majority of the people. If we must reluctantly refuse to recognize them, then today we believe that the various parties have not been able to fully agree on political views in the past, and we still have to painstakingly convene a political consultative conference by the government. Then, if the qualifications of these nine hundred and something representatives are denied or cancelled, will they also form another group like other parties, express their opinions and wishes to the government, and then hold another, or even several, consultative conferences? How will the government handle this? Therefore, the government has no legal basis, and cannot but consider the reason and the current political situation. It cannot but recognize the representatives who have already been elected in the past, and because there is such a view in society, it has adopted a compromise approach in the fourth item, stipulating that within six months after the completion of the task of the first National Assembly, the second National Assembly will be convened in accordance with the constitution to be formulated in the future. The representatives of this second National Assembly will of course be elected by universal suffrage without objection, and their powers will be to exercise the right to elect, recall, initiate, and referendum on the central government. The above is a simple explanation of the four opinions we have put forward on the National Assembly. As for how to reasonably increase the number of representatives to the National Assembly, how to increase the number, and how much increase is reasonable, the government has no preconceptions and would like to submit this to the conference for the opinions of all of you, and then conduct further consultations. In addition, we hope that you will contribute your opinions as much as possible on any problems that we have not thought of, in order to facilitate consultation.

### The New Sixth Army Heads to the Northeast; Limit for Carrying Legal Tender Out of the Customs is 5,000 Yuan; We Have Taken Over the Mainland Academy of Sciences in Changchun

[Shanghai, This Newspaper, Associated Press] 5,000 soldiers of the New Sixth Army are scheduled to leave Shanghai on six US landing craft today for the Northeast. The first landing craft left the port at 10:15 AM. The 26,000 officers and soldiers of the army are expected to leave before the 22nd of this month. If Huludao is frozen, they may land at Qinhuangdao.

[Tianjin, Central News Agency, 16th] The Northeast Security Command established a checkpoint in Yuguan on the 16th, and civilians and soldiers leaving the customs are not allowed to carry more than 5,000 yuan in legal tender.

[Changchun, Central News Agency, 16th] The world-renowned Mainland Academy of Sciences has been taken over by Wang Zheng and Fang Yi, directors of the Changchun Railway Administration, in order to avoid losses. The academy is very large in scale, with 23 research laboratories, including agricultural chemistry, forest product chemistry, animal product chemistry, biochemistry, organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, electrochemistry, physics, civil engineering, first civil engineering, second fermentation soil property, fiber, fuel, combustion metallurgy, machinery, electrical, architecture, and air defense.

### Shen Yi Flies from Beiping to Changchun to Receive 200 Staff in Dalian

[Beiping, This Newspaper, 16th] Shen Yi, the mayor of Dalian, returned to Beiping by China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane at 4:00 PM today. Because there are matters to be dealt with here, he will stay for one day on the 17th, and will change to flying to Changchun with the receiving staff on the 18th to go to his post. Shen is quite optimistic about the situation in the Northeast, but believes that the reception of Dalian is a difficult task, because Dalian has been under foreign rule for half a century, and there are problems with talent, systems, etc. The 200 receiving staff in Dalian this time are more numerous than those in other provinces and cities, but in fact they are still not enough. Taking education as an example, if one person is sent to each unit, more than 100 people are needed, and the difficulties in the system are no less than those in talent. For example, for decades, everything in the city has been based on Japanese, and the suffering of the accumulated difficulties after the takeover is similar to that of Taiwan.

[Beiping, This Newspaper, 16th] The Chinese and Soviets have reached an agreement on the issue of receiving Dalian. Zhang Jiaxuan telegraphed from Changchun, urging Shen Yi to go quickly. Shen can return to Beiping from Qingdao today and is scheduled to fly to Changchun on the 17th. In addition, Sun Yueqi was appointed as a special commissioner of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in the Northeast and flew to Changchun by special plane this morning with more than a dozen industrial and mining experts. Sun himself will return to Beiping in three to five days to deal with unfinished business in Beiping. His position as director of the Bureau for the Disposition of Enemy and Puppet Industries in Beiping and Tianjin will be temporarily taken over by Gu Yiqiao.

[Changchun, Central News Agency, 16th] Another batch of airlifted troops arrived this afternoon, and 56 receiving personnel from various departments, including Sun Yueqi, Li Menghua, Gu Jian, and Wang Zuomin, also arrived in Changchun.

[Harbin, Central News Agency, 17th] The Songjiang Provincial Government recently held its first provincial committee meeting since its establishment. The main agenda was: (1) to organize auxiliary committees for receiving provinces and subordinate counties, (2) to formulate measures to reduce the burden on the people, and (3) to formulate a rural relief plan.

[Siping, Central News Agency, 16th] The receiving work in various counties of Liaobei Province has begun. At 9:00 AM today, Zhao Nudong, the county magistrate of Changtu County, accompanied by police personnel and Soviet liaison officers, went to receive the county. Other county magistrates of Xi'an, Lishu, Kaiyuan, and Liaoyuan are also preparing to set off.

[This Newspaper] San Francisco, 16th, broadcast quoting rumors that Chinese Ambassador to the United States Wei Daoming does not intend to return to his post, and the vacancy will be filled by Dr. Gu Weijun. Wei will assume important positions in the country.

### As Lu Dingyi Speaks of Being Forced to Join Liangshan, Zhou Enlai Keeps Looking at Him

[Chongqing, This Newspaper, 16th] (1) Chen Qitian explained the proposal, emphasizing the method of nationalizing the army and implementing democracy. (2) When Liang Shuming stood up to speak, there was a slight hiss from the audience. (3) When Zhang Qun reported, he did not leave his seat. Fu Sinian protested that he never came, Zhang Qun said because it was not long, he wanted to be lazy, so he stood in the middle and repeated it again. (4) Deputy Minister Lin reported on the progress and plan of army reorganization, and temporarily added a large drawing board frame with a statistical table. All the numbers for nine years were complete. The government made the most confidential things during the war public after the war. (5) Zhou Enlai frankly admitted that there are the deepest prejudices and the strictest boundaries regarding the issue of guns, and it is the most difficult to handle. For the sake of the country and the expectations of the people, he will definitely handle it well. (6) Zhang Dongsun and Liang Shuming urged the government to quickly realize Chairman Chiang's promise, while Li Zili and Chen Bulei said that it is not easy to be thorough and thorough if they are urged too quickly. Today, Zeng Qi hopes that the three-person group should quickly conduct consultations so that the reorganization plan of the CCP army can be completed in advance during the meeting period. Lu Dingyi said that fast is good, but it is difficult to be reasonable and thorough. (7) When Lu Dingyi, the Minister of Propaganda of the CCP, spoke, he spoke in a local accent, repeatedly and repeatedly, quite like a village teacher. (8) As Lu Dingyi spoke of being forced to join Liangshan, Zhou Enlai frequently looked at him. (9) It was already one o'clock, Lu Dingyi was talking endlessly, the chairman rang the bell for the first time, saying that the time was up, but still waited for Lu Dingyi to finish before announcing the adjournment.

### The Ceasefire Deadline Extended Again, Communist Forces Still Disrupting Everywhere, Mediation Department Sends Planes to Distribute Truce Leaflets

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 17th] The Headquarters of the Chinese Army has established close contact with the Peiping Military Mediation Executive Department and has adopted an attitude of extreme trust, providing accurate intelligence on the continued attacks by Communist forces in various regions, including northern Jiangsu, southern Jiangsu, northeastern Anhui, and southwestern Henan, on National Army troops after the ceasefire deadline, the destruction of transportation, and the forceful attacks on the Zaozhuang and Jiawang mining areas. Today, Communist forces in Gaoyou, Taixian, and other areas of northern Jiangsu are still stirring.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 17th] U.S. Representative Robinson of the Peiping Military Mediation Executive Department and Military Affairs Commission Representative Zheng Jiemin, to adapt to current factual needs, will make their greatest efforts to urge the Communist forces in Lincheng and other areas of the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway to quickly comply with the ceasefire order, so as to restore traffic on the entire Tianjin-Pukou line as soon as possible. Communist representative Ye Jianying has expressed his agreement. Yesterday, a U.S. Marine Corps aircraft dropped orders to cease conflict in the areas of Communist forces activity in southern Shandong. It is heard that within three days at the latest, the Military Mediation Department is expected to send an executive group to Xuzhou to work.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 17th] Military News: It is heard that two major difficulties have been discovered in the execution of the military mediation work in Hebei Province: (1) Some members of the Communist forces do not obey the orders of the Communist Party. The majority of these elements are former Japanese soldiers and bandits. The inevitable result for these people is, besides fleeing to the mountains to become outlaws, knowing that there is no other way out, they have begun to mutiny. The Communist Party's policy of relying on bandits for self-importance is akin to using straw to put out a fire, harming the country and afflicting the common people. (2) The number of personnel in the executive group is insufficient for the current factual needs. At least seven or eight more small groups must be dispatched to carry out the work in order to quickly expand operations. The Military Affairs Commission has recently dispatched many more cadres to Peiping, and Yan'an is in the process of selecting more.

[United Press, Peiping, 17th] Central Committee member Zheng Jiemin of the Military Mediation Executive Department, Communist representative Ye Jianying, and U.S. representative Robinson have held two meetings. Today, more planes were dispatched to carry leaflets of Chairman Chiang's ceasefire order to Chifeng, Zhangde, and Jinan, distributing them to both National and Communist armies in order to establish peace.

[Another Dispatch] Although U.S. Navy planes have distributed leaflets spreading the central government's ceasefire order, instances of disobedience continue to occur in various regions.

[United Press, Chongqing, 17th] Government representative Zhang Qun reiterated his previous statement, saying that he would do his utmost to bring the war to a final conclusion. Yesterday, Zhang revealed that the fundamental work of the Military Subcommittee will be completed within one month, and it is expected that the Communist armies will be reorganized two months later. Zhang Qun and Zhou Enlai are both members of the subcommittee.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 16th] Communist forces in Shanxi Province still did not implement the ceasefire order on the 16th. More than 10,000 Communist troops in southern Shanxi launched a fierce attack on Quwo starting at 10:00 a.m. on the 15th, charging over a hundred times throughout the night. On the 14th, they turned to attack Mengcheng and Houma. In the past two days, National Army troops in Fenyang, Qin County, Ningwu, and other areas have also been attacked by Communist forces.

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 17th] After the order to cease military conflict was issued, the Communist forces attacking Yanzhou feigned a ceasefire on the morning of the 14th, withdrawing from the city gates. However, on the evening of the 14th, they scurried back towards the city gates and the vicinity of the train station and airport, constructing fortifications and confronting our defending troops across the city gates. At 5:00 a.m. on the 15th, Communist troops also used a detachment to create disturbances in the southwest corner of our city.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 17th] After the Communist forces invaded Lianzhen on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, they continued to attack Dongguang. As of the morning of the 17th, the situation in Dongguang was unclear due to disrupted communications.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] Military News: On the fourth day after the ceasefire deadline—the 17th—reports from commanders in various regions on the continued attacks by Communist forces on government troops in various regions are recorded as follows: Shandong Province (1) The Communist New Fourth Army, with a force of over 40,000, launched a fierce attack on the county seat of Tai'an on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway at noon on the first day of the new year (lunar calendar), destroying over 30 li of the railway. Chairman He Siyuan sent an urgent telegram to the Military Affairs Commission on the evening of the 15th, requesting that the responsible persons of the Communist Party be informed and that effective measures be taken to stop them quickly. [Jinan, 17th] (2) The Communist forces besieging Liaocheng are still fiercely attacking. Several sections of the city wall have been destroyed by their artillery fire. The Communist forces are also advancing towards the Zichuan train station. It is now reported that the mining areas in Xichuan and other places in Zichuan have been severely damaged again. [Jinan, 17th] Henan Province (1) Commander-in-Chief Sun reported to the Military Affairs Commission on January 16 that the government's 185th Division had been attacked by Li Xiannian's Communist forces since the 14th. In compliance with the ceasefire order, they retreated to Zhou Dangfan, 24 kilometers south of Luoshan, and an area 35 kilometers southeast of Xinyang. On the afternoon of January 16, the commander of the 185th Division reported that the Communist forces attacking the division that morning had sent envoys and formally notified them, saying: "The 7th and 8th Regiments of the Communist forces are ordered to be stationed in Zhou Dangfan." Please quickly inform the responsible persons of the Communist Party to stop them. [Hankou, 17th] Hebei Province (1) The Communist forces under Fu Jize, after occupying Lianzhen on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway on January 16, are now continuing to fiercely attack the county seat of Dongguang.

[Jinzhou, 17th] Suiyuan Province (1) Communist forces besieged the Jining County seat in eastern Suiyuan from the west, east, and south on the evening of the 15th. The attack continued fiercely on the 16th. Commander Fu Zuoyi has urgently telegraphed the Peiping Military Mediation Executive Department to handle the situation quickly. [Gui Sui, 17th] Northern Jiangsu Province (1) Communist forces launched a fierce attack on Gushanj, more than ten kilometers southwest of Xuzhou, on the morning of January 15. (2) Over 10,000 Communist troops advanced to the area north of Jiangdu City on the 14th, attempting to attack the Jiangdu county seat. (3) Communist forces continued to destroy the railway between Baitabu and Caobu, east of Haizhou and west of the eastern section of the Longhai Railway. [Above from Xuzhou, 17th] Shanxi Province (1) Communist forces are still fiercely besieging Jizhou, and are also attacking Houma Town and Jiangxian. (2) Communist forces besieged the Pingshe train station south of Xinxian on the Datong-Puzhou Railway on the morning of January 15. (3) The Fenshuicen military station on the Xugou-Changzhi highway was besieged by Communist forces on January 15, and the Qin County county seat was also surrounded. [Above from Taiyuan, 17th]

[Our Correspondent in Peiping, 16th] According to sources in the transportation industry here: The railway lines have been calm for the past two days, the 15th and 16th. Repair work on the Peiping-Hankou and Peiping-Liaoning railways has begun, and railway employees are all smiles. It is reported that of the 7,000 kilometers of railways under the jurisdiction of the North China Railway Administration, 2,000 kilometers have been damaged and are impassable. However, the actual length of the repair work needed only accounts for a portion of the 2,000 kilometers. If repairs are to be carried out, approximately 500 kilometers of rails, one million sleepers, and some bridge materials are needed. Although some of the required rails may be allocated by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) in the future, this is a case of "distant water cannot quench immediate thirst." The authorities have decided to resolve this issue immediately. It is heard that to quickly reopen the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, the authorities plan to temporarily divert rails from a section outside Shanhaiguan and from the Linzao branch line in Shandong. The Railway Administration has not yet dared to estimate the time it will take to repair and reopen the railways in North China. However, the reporter has learned from various sources that, under favorable conditions, it is indeed possible to complete all repairs and resume traffic within two months. However, even after repairs, it will be difficult to restore the convenience of the pre-war period in the short term, as more than one-third of the locomotives in North China were destroyed by aerial bombardment at the end of the war. The restoration of domestic transportation to its original state still requires prompt and sufficient assistance from UNRRA.

### Abundant Cotton Stockpiles in North China's Rural Areas

China Farmers Bank to Research Purchase Methods

[Our Correspondent in Peiping, 16th] The Peiping branch of the China Farmers Bank opened today, marking the first branch established by the China Farmers Bank in North China after the victory. The reporter visited Manager Zha Shicun and Deputy Managers Su Jilin and Gao Naiming. According to them, the Tianjin branch will cover Hebei Province as its operational area, while the Peiping branch will be responsible for the operations in Rehe and Chahar provinces. This year's national agricultural loans total 4 billion yuan, with the first batch of 1 billion yuan already allocated and the second batch of 1 billion yuan currently being issued. The allocation for Chahar and Rehe is still pending. The bank's future work is currently being studied and designed in detail. Last year, the enemy was unable to purchase the cotton from North China, and there are abundant cotton stockpiles in the rural areas. The bank is currently researching purchase methods.

### Vice Minister of Agriculture Yan Shenyu Busily Inspects in Nanjing

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 16th] Since arriving in Nanjing, Vice Minister of Agriculture Yan Shenyu visited Xiaguan today to inspect the cold storage facilities, providing detailed instructions. The Fisheries and Animal Husbandry Division of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry plans to transport seafood, vegetables, etc., from the cold storage warehouses in Shanghai to Nanjing for sale in the future to regulate the supply and demand between Nanjing and Shanghai. Yan will remain in Nanjing for several more days, and plans to inspect the Nanjing Agricultural Experiment Station tomorrow.

### Citibank and Chase Bank Accept Remittances to China

[Central News Agency, New York, 16th] Citibank and Chase Bank have recently begun accepting remittances to China, with their Shanghai and Tianjin branches paying out in U.S. dollars or issuing New York sight drafts. The rate is temporarily set at 25 Hong Kong dollars per U.S. dollar. It is heard that Mercantile Bank is also accepting remittances for disaster relief. Previously, remittances to China were handled exclusively by the Bank of China. The official exchange rate is 20 national currency units per U.S. dollar, plus a subsidy. With the introduction of this new method, those who originally purchased drafts from the Bank of China have switched to remitting through the aforementioned American banks, as the difference between the official rate and the black market rate is too large. Since the U.S. Treasury Department unfroze foreign funds in the United States and abandoned exchange controls on remittances to China last month, private commercial banks in New York have begun to engage in remittances to China.

### United Nations Security Council Holds First Meeting Yesterday, Iran-Soviet Dispute May Be Resolved Outside the Council, Iranian Representative Prepares to Lodge Complaint with the Council

[Our Dispatch] London, 17th Broadcast: The United Nations Security Council held its first meeting here today. Australian representative Fraser served as chairman. British representative Bevin delivered a speech, stating that Great Britain is a democratic nation and has made great efforts and sacrifices to fight for human freedom in the past thirty years. In the two world wars, countless Britons sacrificed their lives for justice. Now that the war has passed, he hopes that the General Assembly can lay the foundation for world peace in the future. After Bevin finished speaking, British Prime Minister Attlee (formerly spelled as Atlee) stepped forward to shake his hand and congratulate him.

[United Press, London, 16th] The Security Council is scheduled to hold its first meeting tomorrow. Today, Iranian representative Ender Chang declared that once the Security Council convenes, his country will ask the Council to resolve the dispute between Iran and the Soviet Union and prevent the Red Army from continuing to enter Iran. The United Nations Security Council is composed of eleven countries. The Soviet Union is one of the five permanent members and has the power of veto. It can prevent the implementation of any resolution of the Council. The Iranian case appears to be the first test of the Council's powers. The Iranian delegation received instructions from its government last night to lodge a complaint with the Security Council. It is rumored that Iranian Prime Minister Hakimi has resigned. According to Iranian representative Ender Chang, the delegation is unaware of this matter. However, if the Prime Minister does resign, the status of the Iranian delegation to the United Nations General Assembly will be entirely determined by the new government of his country. This complaint to the Security Council is based on the broad principle of protecting Iran's territorial integrity and administrative independence against Soviet aggression.

[Reuters, London, 17th] According to representatives attending the United Nations General Assembly: Before the Iranian representative executed the instructions of his government to submit the Azerbaijan issue to the Security Council, he made a final attempt at mediation outside the meeting last night. The majority of representatives from fifty-one countries took the Iranian issue as the topic of discussion, but the general debate of the General Assembly was not interrupted by it.

[United Press, London, 16th] United Press reporters asked Soviet representatives about the Iranian issue, but they remained silent and only replied, "We are unaware of the Iranian issue." The Iranian delegation hopes that the situation in their country can be "resolved amicably" outside the meeting; otherwise, they are determined to appeal to the Security Council.

[Central News Agency, London, 16th] In the next four weeks, the Security Council will seek to resolve four major issues: (1) The Council should submit a discussion and agree on the nomination of the "Secretary-General" candidates. (2) Determine the date of the first meeting of the military staff committee of the five countries (China, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and France). This staff committee will be a permanent subsidiary body under the procedures stipulated by the Security Council and will continue to perform its tasks. (3) After a general debate and resolution on the proposal submitted by the six countries to form an atomic energy committee, the Security Council will carry out the work of organizing this atomic energy committee. (4) Another major task is to jointly select fifteen judges of the International Court of Justice with the General Assembly.

### British Mandated Territories in Africa Willing to Transfer Jurisdiction, Bevin Announces to the General Assembly

[Reuters, London, 17th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin announced this morning that he intends to transfer British mandated territories in Africa to the Trusteeship Council for management. Last night, New Zealand also planned to entrust the Samoa Islands in the South Pacific to the Trusteeship Council, but still hopes to retain its administrative power over the islands. Bevin did not attend the morning meeting yesterday, and only arrived in the afternoon. When the list of speakers was being drafted yesterday afternoon, the name of the Soviet representative was still not seen on the list. The General Assembly hopes that the Soviet representative can participate in the discussion and express his opinions.

[United Press, London, 17th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin declared to the General Assembly today: Great Britain has begun preliminary negotiations to transfer the three British mandated territories in Africa—Tanganyika, Togoland, and Cameroon—to the United Nations for trusteeship. The Palestine issue will be temporarily shelved pending further consideration by the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry. Transjordan may become independent and cannot be placed under the trusteeship of an international body. Bevin's speech was the focus of attention at this morning's meeting. The meeting was then adjourned for the afternoon's Security Council meeting.

### British Prime Minister Attlee Fetes Representatives, This Meeting is a Symbol of Harmony

[Central News Agency, London, 15th Special Dispatch] British Prime Minister Attlee hosted a banquet for representatives from various countries at the Greenwich Royal Naval College tonight. British cabinet members and guests from all corners of the world sat together. In his welcoming address, the Prime Minister said, "This is a famous observatory, from which we obtain the accurate calculation of Greenwich Mean Time. It is appropriate to host representatives from various countries at this point where the Eastern and Western hemispheres meet. Our purpose here is to eliminate the divisions that exist within a larger framework of unity. I believe that this meeting is a symbol of harmony among nations. We have gathered here from all corners of the Earth to accomplish the unique and noble goal of world peace."

[United Press, Moscow, 17th] The Red Army newspaper "Red Star" published a commentary by international observer Yemashiv today, saying, "The old League of Nations actually became an arena for great powers to compete. Various attempts are now being made within the United Nations to make small countries political tools of some great powers, which will be fatal to the cause of peace."

### U.S. Navy Admiral Towers Promoted to Commander of the Pacific Fleet, Discussions on Outpost Islands are Very Active

[United Press, Tokyo, 17th] U.S. Fifth Fleet Commander Admiral Towers has been promoted to Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Fleet. The handover will take place tomorrow aboard the U.S. battleship USS New Jersey in Tokyo Bay. Rear Admiral Sherman will take over the command. Towers will first go to Washington to consult with Chief of Naval Operations Nimitz, and then go to Pearl Harbor on February 1 to assume his new post.

[United Press, Washington, 16th] After President Truman announced that the United States would retain several Japanese islands, Senator Magnuson, a Democrat on the Senate Naval Affairs Committee, suggested today that the United States could acquire several British bases in exchange for a loan to England. As a result, discussions on the issue of U.S. outposts in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans in the future have suddenly surged again. Magnuson said that the United States should lease bases, regardless of whether they belong to enemy or allied countries. Acquiring British bases is necessary for U.S. defense. He said that this issue should be discussed before approving the loan to England. If the British economy would suffer as a result, he would not make this suggestion. However, most of the bases are on barren islands, so they have no commercial or military value to England.

[United Press, San Francisco, 16th] President Truman stated that the United States will retain the strategic islands in the Pacific acquired from Japan for as long as necessary, but he did not specify which islands should be retained. According to a proposal by the U.S. Navy authorities in September last year, the United States should retain the Ryukyu Islands, Iwo Jima, Saipan, and Yonin. In addition, Wake Island, Midway Island, Eniwetok, Kwajalein, and Truk Island should also be retained to prevent them from being used by other countries.

### International Court of Justice - Seventy-Eight Candidates Compete for Judgeships

Norway and Poland Representatives Claim: Fascist Poison Has Not Been Eradicated

[Reuters London, 17th] At yesterday's United Nations General Assembly meeting, representatives from four South American countries, as well as Norway and Poland, each elaborated on their country's position on various issues. Norwegian Foreign Minister Lie urged all civilized nations to assist peoples who have not yet achieved fully autonomous governments, stating that the trusteeship system is nothing less than a great charter of freedom. Within the United Nations framework, countries of all sizes, even those without direct interests, can work together to build a progressive new world. Polish Foreign Minister Litomoski, in a speech before yesterday afternoon's adjournment, advocated for a unified standard of culture through international joint planning to assist the development of less advanced nations. Representatives from Poland and Norway both warned at the meeting yesterday that the poison of Fascism has not been completely eradicated.

Mexican Representative's View: Five Powers Should Be Renamed Great Nations

The Mexican Ambassador to France, Diaz, speaking in English, said that people still harbor great anxiety caused by atomic energy. The five nations of Britain, France, the United States, the Soviet Union, and China should not be called "Powers," but rather "Great Nations." Because of the convenience of modern transportation, Europe and the Americas are no longer separate, but are connected by the same blood and ideas. The concept of a colonial system no longer exists. Mexico, now holding a seat on the Security Council, is determined to work with other nations with the same resolve to resist Nazi Fascism, safeguarding peace within the principles of justice.

Argentina Acknowledges: Always Embracing the Democratic Spirit

The head of the Argentine delegation, Quintana, spoke, guaranteeing that his country would fully assist in the task of implementing the United Nations Charter. He stated that Argentina has always deeply embraced the democratic spirit and upheld the principle of self-determination for peoples. Regarding international judicial equality and non-interventionism, Argentina has recognized arbitration in the three re-determinations of its borders, and declared, regarding Germany's unrestricted submarine warfare, that the war should proceed according to the basic principles of international law. Now that the United Nations is convening a meeting to address international peace and security, a major responsibility rests upon each nation. Europe has suffered heavy bloodshed and lacks sufficient food, making self-reliance impossible. The Economic and Social Council's decision to collectively work on the world's material rehabilitation work will receive Argentina's great assistance in its realization.

Colombian Representative's Address: Emphasis on Economic and Social Council Work

The representative of Colombia, Leicester Rep, stated that Colombia highly values the United Nations' work in the economic and social spheres, and firmly believes that within this scope, internationalism will replace the selfish ideas of various subgroups. The future economic development of the world will depend on the degree of cooperation between countries.

The last speaker was the representative of Haiti, who strongly stated that although Haiti is a small country, it has great expectations for the United Nations to fulfill its mission, and Haiti is determined to fully support the principles of justice and fairness. Yesterday, it was learned that the representatives of Syria and Lebanon will raise the issue of French-Syrian-Lebanese relations in the General Assembly debate. The Syrian and Lebanese representatives may be supported by other Arab countries.

### US and Soviet Union Secretly Discuss Korean Issue

[United Press Yokohama, 17th] The US-Soviet Joint Commission, responsible for discussing the issue of Korean independence, held its second secret meeting today, and no communiqué was issued afterwards.

### US Hopes Romania Will Return Territory Occupied from Vietnam During the War

[Reuters Washington, 17th] A State Department spokesperson said yesterday that the United States government hopes that Romania will return the territory it obtained from Vietnam in May 1941 to Vietnam, but this view should not be considered as supporting or opposing the pre-1941 borders between Vietnam. It is noted that Romania signed a treaty with Vietnam in Tokyo in May 1941, ceding a portion of Vietnamese territory, including a portion of Laos, northern Cambodia, land west of the Mekong River, and three-quarters of the province of Gongmingxi, to Romania. In 1943, Japan announced that it would transfer to Romania Belise, Qu, and Kedang in Malaya, and Qub and Qub in Myanmar.

### US Soldiers' Movement Demanding to Return Home Still Developing

[This Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 17th Broadcast: The movement of American soldiers demanding to return home is still in full swing, with the most recent developments as follows: (1) In Europe, US Army Commander General McNarney issued an order on the 16th, stating that demonstrations and rallies of soldiers demanding to return home must be stopped immediately, as further gatherings would hinder the work of the occupying forces, and that future gatherings must be ordered by superiors. (2) In Honolulu, a spokesperson for the Rapid Demobilization Movement Committee declared that Eisenhower's statement that rapid demobilization would hinder the government's mission overseas does not include troops stationed in China and other Allied countries. The occupying forces should be limited to Germany and Japan, and stated that a delegation selected to represent Honolulu would testify before the Senate Military Committee's Demobilization Subcommittee. (3) In Manila, Army Chief Patterson flew to Manila from Shanghai yesterday and will be invited to speak at a soldiers' rally on the evening of the 17th.

### Japanese Monk Kamasawa Competing with Hirohito for the Throne - Claims to be a Descendant of the Orthodox Imperial Line - Once Petitioned MacArthur to Allow Him to Ascend the Throne

[Reuters London, 17th] The Daily Telegraph reported from Tokyo today that Emperor Hirohito of Japan has recently met an opponent, a man named Kamasawa, 56 years old, who wants to replace Hirohito and ascend the Japanese throne. He has petitioned Commander MacArthur to restore the throne to the "true imperial line" and eliminate a "historical injustice." Kamasawa's request is quite surprising, but he has some documents that can prove that the imperial throne once held by his ancestors was seized by Hirohito's ancestors through conspiracy and assassination. It is said that there are also some ancient documents, now held by the imperial family and the family of Duke Konoe [who committed suicide last month]. Kamasawa's request today has been passed down through his family for five centuries. During this period, his family has attempted to claim the throne, and many have been subjected to assassination. Kamasawa's father was constantly threatened and monitored by the police, and his movements were restricted. Kamasawa himself, since his father's death seventeen years ago, has been constantly tracked and searched by the Japanese military police, forcing him to wander around the country, afraid to stay in one place for long.

[United Press Baltimore, USA, 17th] The Baltimore Sun's Tokyo correspondent, Cooklan, reported today that a Japanese monk named Kamasawa, claiming to be the Emperor of Japan, has petitioned MacArthur to allow him to ascend the throne, and has attached various documents proving that Hirohito's ancestors replaced Kamasawa's family as the Japanese imperial family 554 years ago. Kamasawa is 56 years old and lives in a city in southern Japan. His address is being kept secret until his personal safety is guaranteed.

### Japanese Political Situation Still Chaotic - Right-Wing and Communist Parties Form Joint Fronts - Currency Continues to Inflate, Famine Greatly Feared This Year

[This Newspaper Tokyo, 17th] Although Japanese politics, under the guidance and support of the Allied forces, are gradually moving towards democracy, the distance is still very far. At the same time, society and the economy are still very chaotic. Shuzo Ishiwatari, the Minister of the Imperial Household, a leading figure of the extreme nationalist faction, has resigned under the influence of MacArthur's political purge directive. He was one of the first to submit his resignation. His successor is Keimin Matsudaira, the eldest son of the famous Meiji-era politician Keiei Matsudaira. He is 65 years old and, after graduating from Oxford University, served as a Chamberlain in the Ministry of the Imperial Household. According to Kyodo News, Japanese right-wing parties have formed a joint front to counter the "United People's Front" formed by the Communist Party. Japanese right-wing elements are rallying under two slogans: (A) Amend the emperor system. (B) Democratize Japan's economy and finance. At the same time, socialist politician Matsumoto advocates dividing Japan into four independent republics. According to Matsudaira, this plan can prevent the resurgence of militarism and dangerous foreign policies, and can raise the living standards of the people. Regarding the Allied control of Japanese enterprises, it is reported that Japanese branch companies with head offices abroad have applied for permission to conduct limited property trading transactions. The Allied Headquarters has authorized the Japanese government to approve this. The quantity of Japanese agricultural products this year is less, and it is currently planned to purchase 30 percent of agricultural products to prevent the future disaster of a famine. In addition, Japan's malignant inflation is intensifying. The Ministry of Finance today denied the rumor of a national bank run. The Bank of Japan announced that as of January 10, the bank had issued 54,902,000,000 yen in banknotes, an increase of 637,000,000 yen since the end of 1945. The total amount of public bonds issued reached 37,478,000,000 yen, a decrease of 359,000,000 yen since the beginning of the year. In addition, after the Japanese government's announcement of the collection of capital tax, the market situation has been fluctuating, and merchants are vying to purchase goods to avoid the tax. The Bankers Association has advised its member banks not to speculate and hoard goods to alleviate the suffering of the people.

[United Press Tokyo, 17th] The new Deputy Cabinet Secretary, Tagiri, resigned today, and at the same time, Murase refused to take office as Privy Councillor.

### US to Appoint Civilians as Judges of the International Tribunal

[United Press Tokyo, 17th] According to MacArthur's headquarters today, the United States has decided to appoint civilians, not military personnel, as judges on the International Tribunal for the trial of Japanese war criminals. MacArthur intends to select a lawyer with a high reputation who does not necessarily have experience, but must have a high position in the legal community. The judges from China and Britain have already been nominated and reported to MacArthur, but they will be announced together after the American selection is decided. The Soviet Union remains silent and has not yet contributed to the organization of the International Tribunal. The organizational law of the Tribunal and MacArthur's and Bar's agreements will be completed around the first of next month, and the trial can be opened. The indictments of the main war criminals in Sugamo Prison will be filed around the 15th of next month, and the first simultaneous trial will be of fifteen or twenty people, including Tojo.

### Churchill Hopes US Troops Will Not Completely Withdraw and Return Home, So That the Fruits of Victory Will Not Be Lost

[United Press Miami, 16th] Former British Prime Minister Churchill, who is here on vacation, said today in clear and resolute language: "I hope that the United States troops will not completely withdraw and return home. The number of other United Nations troops is not large and cannot handle the post-war European problems alone, and maintaining a garrison is essential, so that the fruits of victory will not be lost." I have always advocated partitioning Germany, but it has not been implemented. The United States should not announce the secrets of the atomic bomb until a legitimate world peace organization is established and can properly safeguard the atomic bomb. Previously, if the United States had joined the League of Nations, or had not joined but the US government authorities had taken a strong stance, the Second World War could have been avoided. Unexpectedly, the United States was led by weak and incompetent forces, causing the enemy to run rampant and triggering a catastrophe. The German military's rearmament could have been prevented without firing a shot. The German invasion of the Soviet Union was not unexpected. I had intended to issue a warning, but because I was not yet very close to the Soviet Union at the time, I stopped there." Churchill arrived here today with his wife on a special Havana train. He wore a V-shaped victory badge, was in good health, and was cheerful, blowing the ash from his cigar into the warm air of the sunshine. Churchill wore a brown tropical suit, and his tired and pale appearance had mostly disappeared. The American people gave this special figure a typical American grand welcome. After getting off the train, he drove quickly to the villa of Colonel Clark, the manager of the Canadian Steamship and Pulp Company, escorted by police and motorized troops. The sounds of horns were incessant. Churchill's host in America is Clark. The New York Times in editorial representing America welcomed Churchill, hoping that he rested and enjoyed the sunshine of Florida. They said that in recalling the past, when Britain resisted the Axis powers alone, Churchill bravely and resolutely took responsibility. His words not only inspired the British people, but also inspired the American people. He almost belonged to the American spirit.

### Two Major Muslim Kings Issue Joint Declaration

[Reuters Cairo, 17th] King Farouk of Egypt and King Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia issued a joint statement yesterday stating that we and all the Muslim Arab countries firmly believe that Palestine is an Arab country, and therefore the people of that land and the Arab people everywhere have the right to retain this Arab land. The support of the Arab kings, governments, leaders, and people for their Arab compatriots in Palestine is to uphold the principles of justice. The Arab League aims to collectively cooperate to ensure security, freedom, and independence, and intends to cooperate with other countries in the world based on the principles of rights, justice, and lasting peace. This alliance will never be an instrument for aggression against other countries. It is noted that the Anglo-American Palestine Investigation Committee will soon visit Palestine to observe. The issuance of this declaration is to express the position of the two major Muslim countries on the Palestine issue.

[United Press Cairo, 16th] Regarding the Palestine issue, the Anglo-American Investigation Committee has completed its report in Washington and is preparing to go to Britain and the Middle East to continue investigating the Jewish demands for their ancestral homeland in Palestine. The visit of the King of Saudi Arabia to Cairo this time to visit Farouk is scheduled to last two days. The banquets these days focused on the unity of the Arab nation and did not involve politics. This declaration was read by the Egyptian Prime Minister at the Arab League's welcome meeting for the two kings.

### US Senate Launches Study on Presidential Successor - Concrete Proposals Set to be Submitted in Early May

[Central News Agency New York, 14th Special Dispatch] Senator Green, Chairman of the Senate Privileges and Elections Committee, submitted a proposal today to establish a joint committee of both houses to study the issue of presidential succession. According to Green's proposal, this committee must submit concrete proposals by May 1 on who should succeed the President if both the President and Vice President die. The committee will also study the proposal for the people to directly elect the President through voting, rather than through electors. The reason for the renewed interest in changing the presidential succession is due to President Truman's frequent dangerous air travel (mostly to his family in Missouri) and Ambassador Be尔斯因's extended stay abroad due to diplomatic missions. According to current law, if both the President and Vice President die, the Secretary of State is promoted, followed by the six Cabinet members in order of their department's seniority. It is recalled that shortly after Truman took office as President, he sent a message to Congress suggesting that if both the President and Vice President died, the Speaker of the House of Representatives should succeed the President (currently Rayburn). If the Speaker of the House does not meet the qualifications stipulated by the Constitution, or the position of Speaker of the House is vacant, the President of the Senate should succeed (currently McKeller). Congress should also consider holding a special election to elect a President and Vice President to complete the term of the deceased President. President Truman crossed the United States to deliver the closing speech at the San Francisco Conference last June, and flew across the Atlantic to attend the Potsdam Conference the following month, posing a travel risk. Democratic politicians, in case of Truman's death, did not want the Secretary of State, S退丁斯, to take over as President, and proposed the above suggestion during his mission. The House of Representatives immediately took action on the President's suggestion at the time, while the Senate shelved it. However, the House's action was not thorough, only deciding to make the Speakers of both Houses of Congress the first and second choices for temporary President, and rejected Truman's other suggestion to hold a special election. The issue of presidential succession later subsided. Until yesterday, when President Truman braved bad weather and flew back to Independence City, causing a nationwide outcry, this issue was brought up again.

### American New Inventions for Household Daily Necessities

Other new inventions he mentioned include using dense fog to extinguish fires, unbreakable light bulbs, extended three-minute light switches, glass strip shutters resembling blinds, new smokescreens to protect orchards from frost and insects, and paint mixed with DDT to kill flies and mosquitoes. Among the new inventions of 1945, Babson also listed unbreakable stockings made of ramie instead of cotton or rayon, a book holder hanging from the ceiling for easy reading in bed, a new heating method for homes that uses gypsum to generate heat, a new "packaged kitchen" including an electric refrigerator, stove, garbage incinerator, and dishwasher, an automatic calculating machine that can process 4,000 invoices per hour, and a new electric broom.

### US President Urges Industries to Find Ways to Resolve Labor Disputes

[United Press Washington, 16th] Eight hundred thousand steelworkers in the United States are scheduled to strike next Monday. In order to save this labor dispute, President Truman specially summoned Murray, Chairman of the Industrial Group Committee, and Fairless, Chairman of the Board of Directors of US Steel, to the White House today to advise them to seek reconciliation.

Communist bandits in various counties of Northern Jiangsu, such as Yancheng, Yuhua, and Huaian, fell into their grasp before the arrival of the National Army.

### A Record of the Bitter Cold in Jinzhou

— United Press Reporter, Fourteenth Dispatch

The northeastern provinces experience severe cold in winter, but in the lounges of major hotels here, there are still pots of verdant cacti and palm trees. The sight of them may be surprising, but whether indoors or outdoors, one is already so numb with cold that it is difficult to even be surprised. People may regard these small things as nothing. The Japanese managed the Northeast for fourteen years and almost succeeded in overcoming four thousand years of separation. In Jinzhou, there are two distinct cities: one is the old Chinese city, as ancient as the banner people on the Mongolian grasslands; the other is a brand-new, "Made in Japan" city, its streets and houses exuding a Japanese ambiance, gleaming like a silver dollar.

Jinzhou has always been a strategic location for military strategists. To enter the pass and directly seize the Central Plains, one must first control Jinzhou. It was here that the Northeast cavalry fought fiercely with the Ming Dynasty's army and civilians, because occupying Jinzhou was equivalent to controlling the gateway to the treasure house of the Central Plains. The Japanese, of course, saw this point, but the reverse was not necessarily true. Since November of last year, the Northeast Security Forces have occupied this city of 170,000 people, waiting for orders from above to move into Zhiyang. There are still thirty to forty thousand Japanese people here. Although they brought cacti and added new brilliance to the ancient city, it was all in vain. Life in the old city continues as usual, only the railway station in the new city, the textile factories, the wide, snow-covered streets, and the workers' residential areas show signs of war. Besides a few reporters shivering in the cold wind, there are no other Americans here. The most American thing is packets of "Camel" and "Lucky Strike" cigarettes, sold on the streets by Japanese children or Japanese women carrying babies on their backs. Some Japanese women still have short hair, like men, reportedly to avoid the "Russians." But whether it is effective has not been proven.

After dark, there are no pedestrians on the streets. A curfew begins at nine o'clock, and no one dares to go out. Chinese sentries, like sentries of other countries, would rather shoot first and then ask questions. They guard all night, without the slightest relaxation. The reporter was stopped and questioned by sentries twice in a short distance of two hundred yards. From their tone, one could tell their seriousness. Hearing such a shout seems to make one freeze. The reporter loudly replied "American," stating that the trembling should be attributed to the temperature of minus twenty degrees Celsius. These southern brothers under General Du are not to be underestimated.

This morning, six terrified Chinese youths were led down the street in handcuffs, soldiers with drawn bayonets escorting them. A Chinese staff officer told the reporter: "These are robbers, perhaps to be executed. We will decide their fate based on the severity of their crimes." This indicates that the days of rampant looting in Jinzhou are over. But the situation was very different a month or two ago. At that time, the civil war was active, and after the Eighth Route Army blew up bridges and houses, all damaged buildings, warehouses, and residences were looted clean. The city still retains an impression of fear.

Most of the shops are still closed. Business will only resume after the exchange rate between the Northeast Circulation Notes and the legal tender is determined. The textile factories are also shut down, resulting in worker unemployment. But the people of Jinzhou are strong and unyielding. They may not import cacti or similar plants again. The new city will soon lose its luster and blend with the old. The Japanese guests who have stayed for fourteen years will eventually be sent back to their hometowns. But this ancient marketplace will continue to live its old way of life. Conquerors come and go, and the people here have seen them come and go for centuries.

The National Army's recovery of the Northeast is progressing slowly, reportedly due to the authorities adopting a cautious attitude to avoid hindering the Changchun negotiations. No accidents have occurred between the Chinese and Soviet troops, which is the result of this caution. Taking Yingkou as an example, before the National Army entered, a certain Soviet military officer in Xinmin suggested to the Chinese side that Yingkou was an important place. "Why don't you Chinese troops occupy it?" This report was transmitted to Du Yuming's headquarters, and about two thousand soldiers were ordered to march to the area and safely recover it.

Yingkou used to be a troublesome place. Last autumn, when the US Seventh Fleet transported National Army troops to the area to attempt a landing, they were fired upon by Communist troops on the shore. Until recently, when the Soviet army opened a "green light," the National Army marched in, and four to ten thousand Communist troops scattered. Some of them even took refuge in the Soviet military headquarters in the city. A liaison officer of the Northeast Security Command inquired of the Soviet commander when he would leave Yingkou, who replied that he was awaiting orders from Changchun's Marshal Malinovsky. This indicates that the words of the Soviet officer in Xinmin do not entirely match those from Changchun. In this predicament, the National Army's actions are best taken with caution and strict adherence to the Sino-Soviet Agreement. (According to unofficial news, three thousand Communist troops have returned to Yingkou.) When the National Army can further enter Lushun, Dalian, or Harbin has not yet been agreed upon in Changchun.

The spokesman for the headquarters here still hopes that once the Soviet army completely withdraws by the fifth of next month, all important towns in the Northeast can be completely recovered. However, judging from the current slow progress, this is doubtful. Taking Changchun as an example, although it was the first major city in the Northeast that the National Army entered, the Chinese side's control cannot be said to be consolidated. The National Army airlifted from Beiping numbers only about fifteen hundred troops, of which a thousand are needed to serve as guards for the Chairman of the Nine Northeastern Provinces.

A Portion of the "Yiguandao" Propaganda Booklet

### The Secret History of the Japanese Puppet Tool, "Yiguan Dao," Under the Microscope

— A Special Correspondent, Shao Shenzhi, Reports from Nanjing

The Wang Jingwei puppet regime grew under the wings of the Japanese invaders. Its extreme reactionary nature in political theory was clearly reflected in all its departments. It used so-called gangs and so-called religious activities to control the people in the occupied areas, dragging their lives and thoughts into the dark Middle Ages, attempting to enslave the national character and plunge it into an abyss of ignorance, numbness, superstition, and lack of knowledge. Chang Ni Yuqing's "China Anqing United Association" and Li Ni Bingqing's "China Hongmen United Association" were both effectively used as tools of their evil rule. What the reporter wants to particularly point out is the crime and terror of "Yiguan Dao." In the past four years, with the support of the Wang Jingwei puppet regime, it colluded with the "Anqing United Association," developed its organization, spread poisonous ideas, and had a severely negative impact. Moreover, it clearly undertook intelligence work for the Japanese puppets.

Headquarters Established in Nanjing

The area of activity of "Yiguan Dao" includes the provinces of North China, as well as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Henan, and other provinces. Its headquarters are located in Nanjing, named Chonghua Hall, and its branch halls have different names. In Nanjing alone, there are more than thirty branch halls. In the past four years, its organizational work among the citizens of Nanjing has reached 70%. Its cover is "religion" and "charity." They once operated in the rear areas of the anti-Japanese war, but were severely banned by local authorities and repeatedly ordered to surrender, or else be arrested. It was suppressed by this kind of administrative order. However, in the occupied areas, it continued to expand its organization.

Why did the Wang Jingwei puppet regime make every effort to support "Yiguan Dao"? Just examining its "theoretical" basis makes it clear. The chairman of the Nanjing General Hall of "Yiguan Dao," Chonghua Hall, is Chu Ni Minyi, and the directors are Peng Ni Nian, Zhang Ni Xiangfu, Zhou Ni Xuechang, Li Ni Yunwu, Ge Ni Liangshi, and others. In 1944, Chu Ni Minyi paid the hall 450,000 yuan in the name of "merit." This is a matter that can be verified by documents.

The Absurd Doctrine of "Yiguan Dao"

What is the so-called theory of "Yiguan Dao" (including its "outlook on life" and "teachings")? It must have such a theory as a cover in order to carry out its conspiratorial activities. From a religious standpoint, it propagandizes that other religions (mainly launching an offensive against regular Buddhism, Islam, and Christianity) should convert to "Yiguan Dao." Therefore, it first establishes a chaotic, absurd, and shameless doctrine to the extreme, bringing together a great collection of reactionary, superstitious, and retrogressive ideas. Regarding the origin of "Yiguan Dao," it claims, "Laozi said: 'The Great Dao is formless, giving birth to heaven and earth. Before there was heaven and earth, this Dao existed.' Fuxi drew the trigrams, and the Great Dao descended. The Yellow Emperor wrote the Yin Fu Jing, and began to reveal its wonderful meaning. Later, Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, Wu, and the Duke of Zhou successively received the lineage of the Dao, passing on the inner method to each other, until Confucius. Confucius said, 'My Dao is consistent.' Zengzi said, 'Yes.' Thus, it was passed on to Zeng Shen. Zengzi then passed it on to Zisi, and then to Mencius. Later, the Confucian lineage died out. Fortunately, Western Buddhism flourished. Shakyamuni passed it on for twenty-eight generations to Bodhidharma. Bodhidharma entered China, and the Great Dao was still passed down in one line, as the first ancestor. Afterwards, it was passed down to the Sixteenth Ancestor Qingxu, and the Dao was passed to Donglu. The Three Teachings were united, and Ancestor Gongzhang emerged to succeed him." This is simply nonsense. Who exactly is the so-called "Ancestor Gongzhang"? It is Zhang Tianran, whom "Yiguan Dao" falsely calls "Master." He is from Jining, Shandong, his whereabouts are uncertain, and he is in close contact with the great traitors of the puppet organization. The actual person in charge of the Nanjing General Hall is his son, Zhang Yi, known as the "Daoist Leader." In addition, the organization has "Dian Chuan Shi," who preside over the planchette writing. There are also clerks, communicators, accountants, general affairs personnel, and other positions. There are many "Dian Chuan Shi." They take boys and girls, around the age of ten, who have received special training, to set up altars and conduct planchette writing everywhere, called "Ban Dao." Planchette writing is their basic tool for spreading poisonous ideas.

The god they worship is "The All-Knowing, All-Powerful, Pure, Void, Most True, Most Holy, Three Realms, Ten Directions, Myriad Spirits, True Sovereign," and they have a spirit tablet for him. But in order to simplify things, they created a character "申" to replace it, like a sideways-written character "母". Or they call it "Wu Sheng Lao Shen". It is impossible to calculate the variety and quantity of propaganda that "Yiguan Dao" spreads.

The printing and paper of the propaganda materials are very exquisite. One booklet, "Persuading Followers of All Religions to Return to the Right Path," falsely claims that "Wu Sheng Lao Shen" ordered "Western Paradise Guide Buddha," "Jian Ci Tian Zun Xian Tian Zu," "Islamic Lord Muhammad," and "Jesus Christ" to descend to the altar and write planchette writing, persuading followers of all religions to convert to Yiguan Dao. Its conspiracy is clearly to destroy general regular religious culture and drag people into the extremely reactionary abyss of "Yiguan Dao" in order to strengthen the rule of the Japanese puppets.

In a booklet titled "Provisional Buddhist Rules," it says: "European winds have come to the East, and science is revered. The code of ethics of the former kings is swept away, and the etiquette of the sages is abandoned. Therefore, negative energy swells, yin and yang are at odds, disorders follow each other, and disasters arise, leading to an unprecedented catastrophe. The current extreme disaster is, as the former sages said, 'calamity is created by people, and the principles of numbers make it so,' which is not false." This is completely justifying the cruel slaughter by the Japanese puppets in the occupied areas. It also says: "Since I (Zhang Tianran referring to himself) have cultivated the Dao, I have never been involved in politics. I have only been correcting people's hearts, speaking of benevolence and righteousness, emulating the ancient sages and worthies, and only discussing sacrificial vessels and fragrant offerings. However, the Dao has never been easily transmitted, so I strictly follow the altar instructions of Lord Guan Sheng. The procedure for seeking the Dao slightly takes into account the merit of the seeker to verify the truthfulness of belief, and uses small funds to brush books and print teachings, or to receive visitors and help the poor. There are no donation rules." What kind of face does Yiguan Dao actually wear? This is quite clear. The lead-printed booklets that the reporter has seen also include: "Compilation of Ethical Principles and Moral Standards," "Golden Admonitions for Awakening from Delusion," "Three Teachings Reaching Understanding," "Guide to Enlightenment," "Elixir for Transforming into Goodness," "Questions and Answers about Yiguan Dao," "Beginner's Guide to Yiguan Dao," "Simple Words of Reason," "New Introduction to Guandao," "Sacred Teachings of the Three Teachings," "True Commentary on Yiguan," "Mixed Yuan Cloth Bag True Scripture," "Essential Words for Explaining the Dao," "Must Read for Yiguan Cultivation," "Records of Yiguan Debate," "Discussion on the Five Rules of Cultivation," "Guide to Awakening the World," "Yiguan Buddhist Mother Scripture," "Collection of Yiguan Sacred Instructions," "Compassionate Voyage Golden Mirror," "Must Read for Yiguan Female Practitioners," "Life Rules of Yiguan Dao," "Bodhidharma's True Transmission," "Annotated Vernacular Explanation of the Great Learning," "Records of Manifestation of the Ziguang Tongle Class," and more than a hundred other types.

The Ministry of Social Affairs believes that the Chonghua Hall of "Yiguan Dao" is a religious group being exploited that usually spreads rumors and deceives the public, and harms public morals. It was disbanded in accordance with the law. The Ministry ordered the China Ljiao Society to temporarily keep the houses and equipment at No. 187 Jianye Road and No. 99 San Mao Palace for processing. However, disbanding it alone is not enough. These presiding members must be arrested and interrogated to thoroughly eliminate the poisonous thoughts. The large number of documents I have collected are enough to prove all of their poisonous activities! What is particularly noteworthy is that, in addition to "Yiguan Dao," there are so-called "Tianxianhui," "Yixin Tiandao Huahuang Jiaohui," and "Zhonghua Xiantian Dao," etc., which, although they have disappeared after victory or have been disbanded, it is worth studying whether they are peripheral organizations of "Yiguan Dao."

Beautiful Warrior with Flowers, Awaiting Her Ship Home to America

A Big Surprise Entering Forbidden Territory

The reporter, accompanied by Xu Lin, a specialist from the Ministry of Social Affairs, visited No. 187 Jianye Road. This is the location of the General Hall of "Yiguan Dao," which has always been a secret forbidden area. After it was disbanded by the Ministry of Social Affairs, security police were assigned to guard it. As I walked to the door, I felt like I was walking into a demonic lair described in "Sword Hero Novels." The building is oriented in reverse, with a total of three courtyards separated by two courtyards in the middle. When entering, one must walk along a cement path about fifty meters long, with high walls on both sides. Staggered dwarf evergreens are planted on the sides, giving a somewhat eerie feeling. The two main doors are wrapped in iron sheets, nailed with dense iron nails. After we rang the doorbell, we waited a long time before the security police slowly came out from inside and opened the door.

The furnishings inside the house surprised me. All the furniture, including beds, couches, tables, stools, and desks, were made of rosewood with fine workmanship. This was the first time I had seen such luxurious furnishings in Nanjing. In particular, bronze bells, ancient porcelain, and jade chimes were everywhere. The walls were covered with marble and rosewood screens, and there were rich Buddha implements. The painted rafters and beams were like flowers. It really didn't look like an ordinary charitable organization. It is said that "Yiguan Dao" used the organizational and political pressure of the puppet organization to amass considerable wealth, and has successively transferred it to those so-called Daoist leaders and Dian Chuan Shi, turning it into private property. The fact that only two of the more than thirty branch halls are now being taken over by the Social Affairs Ministry, well illustrates this point.

After walking through the path, I turned right and then right again to enter the house. At this time, the doors of two houses were open. At the door were brick columns, painted bright red, and on the top of the door was a pattern of "Bottle Rising Three Battles." Inside the door, on a white screen wall, was a large red character "福" (good fortune), hiding behind wisteria. Turning left here, one passes through a round doorway, with a red-bottomed black-character seal-script horizontal plaque above it, one side saying "Gate of Morality" and the other side saying "Purple Qi Comes from the East." Entering the round gate, there is a courtyard. To the right is the path to the offering hall, and to the left is the clinic of "Yiguan Dao." In the middle, an offering hall is set up with spirit tablets. A couplet is written on it: "The sixteen-character heart transmission of the sacred domain all returns to Yiguan; The thousands of words of Xinmin Mingde are taught to save the multitude." The back is where the "Master" lives, which even those who have entered the Dao cannot go to, only great traitors can enter and exit. The size of the house is the same as the offering hall, but what is offered in the middle is not a spirit tablet, but four screens and a couplet written by Kang Youwei. It seems to be dedicated to enshrining the handwriting of this leader of the 保皇 party. To the left of the hall is the bathroom and toilet, and to the right is where the "Master" lives. I saw secrets in these two places. In the middle of the small table in the bathroom, I found a large pile of draft planchette writings written by elementary school students. The interior of the bathroom is extremely refined, with plumbing facilities. The "Master"'s room contains more ancient porcelain, bronzes, and jade articles, although most of them are imitations, they are all of good quality.

Secret Discovery in Camphor Chest

In a camphor chest with a coiled dragon, a large number of perfumes, powders, and clothing materials were found, as well as many new women's shoes and menstrual belts, and a draft telegram from the puppet organization's police agency. What is especially important is the draft of a letter signed "Shi Bi" from Beiping to Sun Ni Xiangfu, a member of the puppet military commission, which reads:

"...Friends in Beijing and Shanghai have repeatedly urged me to travel south, and I also intend to travel south to meet with you and recount our long separation, which has always been my desire. However, due to many troublesome matters, I have been unable to make the trip early. Recently, many matters in the north have been added for me to handle, making it impossible for me to travel south. I will wait for the future. I arrived in Ping on the 23rd of this month, and everyone is safe and well. After starting, I received the big note you forwarded to me, which made me very happy. It said that you may be assigned to an important position in Guangdong again. You consider the inconvenience to the Dao, which is very good. However, it is an order of the government, and there is no way to refuse. As for Chonghang asking you to go with him, your intention not to go with him is very good. However, we should understand the times in this extraordinary situation. As for the idea of bringing Chen ashore, it shows that you have planned carefully. I hope you can discuss it with Lizi and handle it. Yours sincerely! Shi Bu (April 23)."

This shows the relationship between "Yiguan Dao" and the puppet organization.

The thought of "Yiguan Dao" and the thought of the traitor are intertwined. To eliminate the poisonous elements of Wang Wei's thought, all accomplices related to it must be severely punished! A page of planchette writing originals found in the bathroom

### American Soldiers' Foreign Wives Join the Great Melting Pot

These days, American army transport ships have been arriving at American docks, and military bands often play the tune "Here Comes the Bride," and the number of times they play it is indefinite. This is forgivable, because many army ships and even merchant ships have recently been carrying batches of American soldiers' brides. However, these batches are not enough to satisfy the American soldiers who are husbands. To date, only 10,000 foreign new brides have arrived in the United States, while there are as many as 60,000 women who married soldiers overseas. As for those who are engaged, it is even harder to count.

The brides come from all over the world where the U.S. military has been stationed, but the problems they face when they arrive in the United States are the same. They all have to adapt to the rules and customs of this new world. Considering the many difficulties in getting married overseas, it is amazing that so many people have found a good match. However, it is worth pointing out that some marriages have many setbacks and are quite annoying.

### They Remember Their Old Home and Suffer from Homesickness

Naturally, they also miss their homes. Almost everyone suffers from severe homesickness. However, some brides, who are already mothers or pregnant, don't miss their homes as much because they have other things on their minds.

Among the brides whose husbands are abroad and who work in the city, a typical figure is Mrs. Romano, a beautiful twenty-one-year-old woman born in London. She was a member of the British Women's Land Army.

Mrs. Romano said about the first time she and her husband met in a "Camp Hotel" in Dunmow, Essex, England, "Another American soldier was teasing one of my girlfriends, and he came over kindly and stopped him, and that's how we met."

In April 1944, one year after they met, they got married. Shortly after the marriage, Private First Class Romano was transferred to France and Germany. Mrs. Romano has not seen him since. She is now a clerk in a bank in New York, and she likes living in the United States. Another, even more Americanized, is Mrs. Carney, formerly Miss Lanrik, a twenty-five-year-old from Nottinghamshire, England. Mrs. Carney worked in an armory, speaks "American," and loves the U.S. infantry unit nicknamed the "Brooklyn Diggers." She said, "I'm not patriotic at all, but I only love the American infantry."

### I Am Not Patriotic At All, Only Love American Soldiers

Another office worker is Mrs. Rainey, formerly Miss Huth from the Renfrewshire region of England. Mrs. Rainey is twenty-four years old and worked in the British Air Ministry. She met American soldier Rainey in a London air-raid shelter during an air raid in 1943.

The majority of overseas brides, about 90%, come from the British Isles and the Antipodes of New Zealand, but they are not necessarily the easiest to Americanize. Private First Class Prlechev's nineteen-year-old wife, Suria, with her autumnal eyes, had spent the past few years of her life entirely in the desert war. She is a resident of Hamlif in Tunisia, North Africa, and is very clear about the Nazis, because the Nazis had been in a village near her home for six months, sometimes fighting and sometimes playing. She said, but later because "they were, as you say, annoying - I never thought about them again.

### 40,000 American Husbands Await Their Brides

Mrs. Prlechev, like most soldiers' wives, said that she met her husband "at a party." Her only regret is that he speaks French very well, which has prevented her from learning English well. Although she admits that she often misses her home and plans to go to Tunisia once after the war is over, she likes everything about Americans. She summarizes her impressions by saying, "I like America very much, the women are all friendly, and I like the men very much."

The foreign wives of officers have more generous incomes, so there are fewer problems.

After the war ends, the biggest problem will be how to bring a large number of overseas brides to the United States with their husbands. There are now 40,000 husbands in the United States waiting for their brides.

Due to the intensification of demobilization, the first priority is to transport the soldiers who went overseas to fight. Therefore, the transportation of the soldiers' families has become even more problematic. The U.S. Army, the State Department, and Congress are currently considering new ways to bring the brides to the United States as soon as possible.

The Ping Shan Airport Incident in Kowloon

Editor-in-Chief: Recently, the British have been forcibly building an airport in Ping Shan, Kowloon, for three months, and there has not been much activity in the newspapers. This fact is something that the people of the country are angry about, and it is a major event that should require the government to quickly stop it. It is especially necessary for the public opinion to loudly call for and urge it. It is well known that your newspaper speaks for the people and says what people want to say and dare not say.

Please Pay Attention to Pawnbrokers' High Interest

Editor: The end of the year is approaching, and the poor rely entirely on pawnbrokers to tide them over. It is found that pawnbrokers in this city, because the puppet currency depreciated and inflation occurred, the interest rate per yuan rose to thirty-one cents, plus a storage fee of fifteen cents. So, each time you redeem one yuan, you have to actually pay forty-six cents in interest. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, all industries are adjusting, but the rich pawnbrokers' interest rates have not been reduced. Therefore, I borrow a corner of your newspaper and implore the authorities to adjust the interest rates of pawnbrokers, which will benefit the people, and is not insignificant. (Reader, Yuan Hong)

### Financial Rehabilitation Issues in Recovered Areas

— Sheng Mujie

Currently, there are four major problems urgently needing resolution regarding the financial rehabilitation of various cities in the recovered areas:

1.  Re-establishment of Financial Institutions. While Shanghai experienced a period of financial chaos and stagnation, followed by recovery through reorganization, businesses did not suffer greatly as a result. However, cities in the interior deeply felt the inconvenience of financial paralysis. All transactions required cash as the medium of exchange. Before the war, financial institutions in these cities were primarily money shops, commercial bank branches, and branches of national banks, all of which were dismantled during the war. The newly established institutions were registered with the puppet regime. After the victory, all were legally shut down for review. However, most of the pre-war money shops in these areas have closed down and show no sign of reopening. Furthermore, the original branches of national banks and commercial banks have been slow to resume operations. This has not only made it difficult for local businesses to obtain financing but has also hindered the flow of capital from other regions.

The biggest reason for the current financial stagnation in various cities is that national banks are focusing only on a few large metropolitan areas, neglecting other cities. Commercial banks are eager to restore their original branches in these cities, but delays in the application process to the Ministry of Finance and slow postal service have left branch managers waiting to be dispatched. They are well aware of the strong desire of local businesses for the re-establishment of financial institutions, but they are powerless due to legal procedures.

2.  Counterfeit Currency Exchange. The slow progress of counterfeit currency exchange is undeniably in urgent need of correction. In Shanghai, the initial counterfeit currency exchange work was entrusted only to the four major banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank of China) and the two Central Trust of China and Postal Savings & Remittances Bureau. After the addition of four smaller banks with government ties and appeals from various sectors, more exchange locations were established, and ongoing money shops were authorized to handle exchange as agents. However, for over two months, a large amount of counterfeit currency has continued to exist and circulate in Shanghai. In cities in the interior, it is even more so a world of counterfeit currency. Of course, the unit of accounting for all businesses has been changed to legal currency, but the habit of pricing in both legal and counterfeit currency has almost become ingrained in merchants and the general public. Today, almost all transactions in these cities are conducted using counterfeit currency. A bolt of cloth or a bale of yarn is bought and sold with piles of counterfeit currency being tossed around like waste paper!

One might ask, "Aren't there counterfeit currency exchange institutions in these cities?" Yes, there is! Only the post office is exchanging counterfeit currency, or perhaps a branch office of a provincial bank at most. Because these institutions are not specifically dedicated to counterfeit currency exchange, but rather handle it as an ancillary function, how can they actively carry out exchange work? Moreover, when exchanging, merchants or people must categorize the denominations and designs of the counterfeit bills, accumulating a certain amount before they can exchange them for legal currency. This is far less convenient than pushing them around in the market. How can it produce a significant exchange effect? Therefore, counterfeit currency naturally continues to flood the market, and when the exchange is eventually cut off, the people will cry out in hardship!

3.  Lowering Interest Rates. Before the war, interest rates were between 1% and 1.5% per month (10-15 per thousand), which is 12% to 18% per annum. At that time, anything exceeding 20% per annum was considered usury. During the war, with skyrocketing prices, the profits from business were extremely high. Creditors gradually increased the interest rates they demanded from debtors, and debtors, due to the high business profits, were willing to borrow at high interest rates. As a result, financial institutions had to raise deposit interest rates proportionally to attract social capital, otherwise, they would not be able to absorb social funds. Naturally, as the tide rises, the lending rates of financial institutions would also have to be multiplied the deposit rates. Therefore, the trend of interest rates rose from 2% per month to 20% per month. In Shanghai, some money shops nominally charged interest rates of 20% per month, but because interest was deducted in advance, it amounted to 25% per month (commonly known as "large two-and-a-half points"). Interest rates in Shanghai are now tending to decline, to around 8% per month, but interest rates in cities in the interior are still very high.

In the past, interest rates in various cities were two to three times higher than in Shanghai. Hearing that interest rates are only 20% or 15% per month may seem lower than Shanghai, but in reality, they are not calculated monthly but every ten days, amounting to as much as 45% to 60% per month! After the victory, with the removal of enemy puppet control, smoother transportation, unprofitable speculation and hoarding, and a downward trend in prices, interest rates have gradually fallen, but are still high compared to pre-war levels, even higher than the current high interest rates in Shanghai. Furthermore, due to the small number of financial institutions resuming operations and the difficulty of financing, interest rates are not consistent, currently ranging from 10% to 15% per month. The high interest rates are preventing businesses from engaging in legitimate economic activities.

4.  The Problem of Closed Financial Institutions. As mentioned earlier, all financial institutions in various cities during the war were registered with the puppet regime and are now being legally shut down for review. This is, of course, without issue. However, the pre-existing money shops and branches of national banks and commercial banks have not yet resumed operations, creating a gap. The financial institutions that are shut down for review seem to see a glimmer of hope and are taking the opportunity to conduct underground bill discounting and lending while undergoing review. All of this is documented but has no legal basis. They believe that it is better to operate secretly than to obtain security or legal status to operate. Therefore, under various pretexts (some of which are justified), there is a trend of demanding to resume operations or re-establish themselves.

In summary, although there are four problems with the financial rehabilitation of various cities today, the fundamental solution lies in the rapid re-establishment of legitimate financial institutions. The lack of legitimate financial institutions prevents the counterfeit currency exchange from unfolding, hinders the turnover of industrial and commercial capital, makes it difficult to lower market interest rates, and causes closed financial institutions to demand to resume operations. Furthermore, financial stagnation also affects other sectors of the economy, preventing them from accelerating their recovery and transitioning to peacetime economic development. Currently, financial authorities seem to be focusing too much on the financial rehabilitation of urban areas and forgetting the financial rehabilitation of cities surrounding urban areas. Financial authorities should quickly correct this distorted phenomenon in the recovered cities.

### Speculative Gangs Arbitrarily Raise Prices: Gold Prices Rise Another 60,000, US Dollar Follows, Hong Kong Notes Continue to Fall; Rumors Spread That Gold Savings Certificates Will Be Settled in Cash

Yesterday, rumors spread that the current term of gold savings certificates would expire and no longer be paid in cash, but would be settled in cash. This sparked various speculations. Securities brokers, having absorbed enough shares in recent days, intended to continue their efforts. As soon as they had the opportunity, they made their move. Early in the morning, they continued the momentum from the previous evening, wildly raising the price to around 920,000. This price was bought by a Mr. Wang from the paper industry, using it to prove the actions of the previous evening. However, silver shops sold off their physical gold, and high-priced sellers gathered. At this time, the US dollar, with the physical goods of the money exchange shops selling off, became looser and looser. The spread against gold reached 618 yuan per ten taels, and there were many arbitrage sales in the gold market, so it gradually declined. However, the long and short sides fought fiercely over the 900,000 mark for a long time. Finally, due to excessive artificial manipulation, profits were taken from all sides, and it fell below 895,000. The afternoon closing was 895,000. After the closing, stock and bond brokers continued to buy, deliberately raising the price again and again, and returned to 933,000. In the afternoon, spot prices hovered between 925,000 and 932,000. Large brokers watched eagerly, hoping to take the opportunity to make a killing. However, the Sichuan bankers had a high price to sell, and it was still difficult to move until the banks closed. As a result, it rose 63,000 compared to the previous closing. Silver jewelry was 99,000, silver bullion was 700 yuan, silver dollar was 460, and private discounts were tight due to the securities brokers focusing on the gold market, but interest rates were still about 9 to 12%.

The US dollar was not affected by the wild price increase of the gold price by the paper certificate traders. The foreign exchange industry sold its physical goods as soon as it entered the market to get profits. The 1,500 yuan mark was not penetrated. The securities traders, who were bullish at the end of the year, instead supplied the market one after another. Afterwards, the gold market stepped down due to the arbitrage sale from the US dollar side, and the US dollar followed the gold market. However, the trend was still mediocre, falling to 1,455 yuan. In the afternoon, the gold market was still manipulated and raised wildly, and the US dollar was also brought up to 1,505 yuan. Until 3 o'clock, it hovered around 1,490 yuan. As a result, it rose 63 yuan compared to the previous closing. Hong Kong old banknotes were slightly stable, and the result was a recovery of 5 yuan. New banknotes continued to fall, with the lowest price of 76 yuan for the "one" series and 74 yuan for the "two" series, and then slightly pulled up. The result was still a drop of 1 yuan. Because there were no short positions in the US dollar that could be squeezed, and because the speculators filled out the market, special attacks were made on the spot, and the spread had the potential to rise to 650 yuan.

### Public Bonds Rise and Fall, Many Bulls Close Out, Voices Are Heard in the Market, Stocks Also Show Fatigue

Public bonds, after the wild rise the day before yesterday, were filled with bankruptcies and fugitive clients in the industry. The industry originally had no legal organization, and whenever there was a storm, it collapsed repeatedly. Yesterday, there was not much trading in the market, and the long and short sides sought to close out on their own. Category C bonds opened miserably, falling to 1,500, and outside capital still rushed in, raising it to a new high of 2,000 yuan. This price has reached the price that will be paid with customs duties in the future. The bulls seemed satisfied and closed out one after another. At noon, it had fallen below 1,700, and the noon closing was 1,750 yuan. Transactions were sporadic. As a result, it rose slightly compared to the previous closing, but it fell back a lot compared to the dark market the previous evening.

Chinese stocks, although they received the help of the gold market yesterday, still rose, but the major shareholders' inventories have been exhausted after being released in recent days. Concentrating on the spot, the stock market only relied on retail investors, which had a gloomy feeling. At noon, they all hovered at low prices. As a result, Yongsha fell by 50 yuan compared to the previous closing, Mei Ya was average, and Xinhe was also the same. The three small hot stocks were slightly softened. Starting today, the Chinese stock dark market will move to the 7th floor for meetings.

Foreign stocks initially rose high and finally fatigued, still being influenced by the Chinese stock market. Yisha gradually fell from 3,900 yuan, British Union from 5,100 yuan, and Yipi at 1,350 yuan. Paper industry stocks hovered around 1,100 yuan, which was quite stable. Jardine Matheson was extremely stable yesterday due to the excessive decline the day before yesterday. At noon, the result compared to the previous closing was that Yisha continued to fall by about 100 yuan, Yipi paper industry stocks were the former flat and the latter old fell by 100 yuan, Jardine Matheson rose slightly, rubber stocks were average, and the situation may stagnate.

### Opposition to US Cotton Price Limits Strengthens

### Cotton Fabric Sales Are Very Strong

Yesterday, Han merchants purchased shilin bleached cloth and blue cloth, but the spot goods could not meet their expectations, so they could not do as they pleased. Striped poplin from the Sichuan merchants was very popular, and customs declarations and shipments were unusually busy in recent days. However, Changzhou and Wuxi 12-pound fine cloth was flat because there were more goods on the market, and dyeing and weaving factories were also unwilling to use it because the fiber quality was not good. Yesterday, the market reported 70,000 yuan for shilin Meiting, 65,000 yuan for chicks, 64,000 yuan for Prosperous Dreams, 50,000 yuan for Dingruyi bleached cloth, 37,000 yuan for special mainland blue, 35,000 yuan for ordinary mainland blue, 36,000 yuan for Flying American aviation blue, 34,500 yuan for Daming striped poplin, 40,500 yuan for longtou fine cloth, 26,000 yuan for Changzhou fine cloth, and 29,000 yuan for Wuxi fine cloth.

### Silk Industry Unanimously Prosperous, Artificial Silk Rises Frenetically

Rayon fabrics hit new records. Yesterday morning, one case of 120 bridge rayon sold for 1,145,000 yuan. The price was called out at 1,170,000 yuan in the middle, and it reached 1,200,000 yuan in the afternoon. Because the price was too high, buyers generally adopted a wait-and-see attitude. In the morning, the smallest warehouse receipt was 870,000 yuan, the price was done at 910,000 yuan in the middle, and the highest price was 950,000 yuan in the afternoon. Buyers all gave up cash and sought warehouse receipts, so there were many transactions. Manufacturers did not have much honor or disgrace. They were 230,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Silk fabrics showed fatigue in the market price the day before yesterday. Yesterday, the market suddenly rose again, exceeding the high price on Tuesday. In this fierce rise in raw materials, the calculation of silk fabrics is the cheapest, and there is a profitable point to be gained. Everyone pays attention to absorption, resulting in this rising trend. Meiya bed covers were 745,000 yuan per hundred, Dachang Gebi crepe was 2,180 yuan per yard, and Minsheng jacquard satin was 10,500 yuan per piece. The above are all transaction prices.

Foreign Currency Deposits and Remittances Are Prohibited from Being Accepted by Banks [Reported by This Newspaper] In the past two days, the financial market has been stirred again. General speculators have also rumored that when the new exchange rate is announced, its price will be higher than the current black market. Therefore, some merchants did not know the truth and bought foreign currency from the black market, and a few banks may have accepted foreign currency deposits and converted foreign currency cash into telegraphic transfers or postal remittances. The Financial Commissioner in the Beijing-Shanghai district yesterday specially and solemnly notified the Municipal Banking Association, the Money Shop Association, and various foreign banks: "It has been found that the country's foreign exchange policy is currently being planned by the government as a whole.

Please follow these instructions immediately and transfer them to all banks and money shops to comply, do not violate them."

### Coal Market Stable, Pine Firewood Retail Sales Smooth

The rising trend of bituminous coal chunks is gradually easing, because they have risen continuously for days, and there is inevitably a virtual rise in the middle. It is difficult for importers to start, and they all intend to wait and see. The sales of bituminous coal dust are slightly smoother than before. The market for white coal screened chunks is slightly erratic amidst sluggish sales. The trends of small coal and coal dust are still flat. Charcoal has arrived from various places, especially steel charcoal, but because the price is cheap, sales are still active. Retail sales of pine firewood are very strong, and the market situation is firm. There are currently fewer shipments of chestnut firewood. According to industry insiders, a large number will arrive from the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway in two or three days.

### Japonica Rice Rises, Soybean Oil Falls

The rice market is actively digesting, and it has risen by another two or three hundred yuan. White yuan indica rice has also risen by two or three hundred yuan following japonica rice. The oil market's appetite has weakened, and soybean oil has fallen by a thousand yuan. Crude oil has also fallen by five or six hundred yuan. The opening was still possible early in the morning. The closing suddenly saw a decline. Soybeans are firmly positioned, soybean cakes are flat, raw peanuts are high and stagnant, sesame is flat, and flour prices are strong due to the absorption of Hunan and Hubei merchants, adding more than a hundred yuan. The market is very active. With the end of the year approaching, the source of Jiangbei liquor is scarce, and the shop has a strong appetite, rising another five hundred yuan. The market trend is strong.

### Wool Continues to Rise

Wool continues to rise due to the successive purchases of the Sichuan merchants. The numbers in the market are all buying mutually, and common shops that sell men's and women's clothes are also purchasing, in addition the price of gold and the other goods are rising, so the price of wool is still going up. Also, because there is a lack of inventory and the factory is recovering production and the goods owners are hoarding goods, especially those common goods and clothes for the Spring/Summer that has a light color has an especially strong trend.

### Tianjin Merchants Absorb in Large Quantities, Tea Market Trends Strong

The tea market in this city has been trending quite sharply in recent days. The actual sales buyers are particularly surged, especially after the Tianjin merchants have been unable to handle the goods for a long time, the local tea reserves are extremely rare, and the prices are 60% to 70% higher than those in Shanghai. The tea merchants in Shanghai are all benefiting from this. All the shopkeepers on this street are also adding stock frequently because the Lunar New Year is approaching, but it is found that the inventory in this city is not abundant, so the holders are reluctant to part with it, resulting in the continued show of prices with insufficient supply. Some flower colors have risen more than the previous day.

### Tallow Tree Oil Rising Trend Unabated

The incense and candle business has been booming for the past week, and the tallow tree oil, which is the raw material for candle making, is not enough for each candle to use. They re-purchase in large quantities. The insiders did not prevent the sudden arrival of the sales place, resulting in the sales emptying in the past few days, and had to purchase from various production areas, but now the Hangzhou call came, Shanbai oil has risen to 19,000 yuan, and Jiaxing's car oil has also increased by 25,000 yuan, all delivered on the spot, so starting today, the insiders will sell Heben oil for 27,800 yuan, Shanbai oil for 22,300 yuan, and Sichuan white wax because the traffic is not smooth and the source is interrupted, inventory has dried up, selling rice heart accounts for 600,000 yuan per market load.

### Spinning Construction Continues to Sell, Yarn Market Sentiment Stable

Yesterday, the yarn market was still firm, and customers from Beijing and Hangzhou came to purchase. Although the amount was not large, it was quite lively. The support was good for 10,000 pieces, and the sentiment was also very stable. Because red gold and US dollars have both seen gains, if the Spinning Construction Company had not been supplying and selling for days, the soaring price of yarn would not have been behind others. The Spinning Construction Company continues to sell in large quantities, and most of the buyers are silk factories, cotton weaving factories, and retail stores. The company's opening price is the same as the previous day, and there is no increase or decrease.

### Summary of Business Conditions

### Recent News on Battlefield Youth Recruitment and Training: More Youth Trained in Nanjing, Shanghai Refresher Courses to Open Soon, Wuhu to Establish Vocational Classes

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing] The Battlefield Youth Recruitment and Training Committee, directly under the Executive Yuan and chaired by Minister of Education Zhu Liuxian, is responsible for recruiting and training battlefield-displaced youth. The committee is located in Chongqing and has established registration offices in Nanjing, Shanghai, Ping, Anhui, and other recovered areas since the victory against Japan. It recruits displaced and out-of-school youth for relief and training. Since the Nanjing office (Director Liu Shaozhong) was established on Jingxi Road, youths from various places have registered, and those who have passed the review and are high school or university graduates have been sent to temporary university preparatory classes for remedial studies. More than 200 people (more than 70 actually registered) have been sent to temporary university preparatory classes. Since the establishment and opening of these two classes, high school students and above will no longer be recruited.

Nanjing Training Institute As for middle school students, those registered from various places, such as Yangzhou, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, and Shanghai, together with the Nanjing registration office, total more than 1,000. Except for 300 students who have undergone short-term training and been assigned to the three National Temporary Middle Schools in Nanjing, there are currently 400 students receiving training at the Nanjing Shigu Road Youth Training Institute.

### Brief Reports

Zhou Xianchu has been appointed by the Zhejiang Education Department as the director of the Provincial Hangzhou People's Education Center, and Zhou Boping has been appointed as the director of the Provincial Hangzhou Sports Ground.

The Anlan Senior Vocational School, established to commemorate the late Lieutenant General Dai Anlan, who died in the Burma Campaign, had its board of directors ordered to come to Shanghai to prepare for the school's reopening. It has now designated 150 Hainin Road as the preparatory office and is actively starting work to prepare for the school's reopening in the short term.

The Private Daozhong Girls' Middle School in this city was founded solely by Cui Jianwu. After the January 28th Incident, it moved from Zhabei to its current location. The original lease was indefinite. After the August 13th Incident, the original owner suddenly transferred the property to Zhou Bangjun, a traitor, who used the power of the enemy and puppets to exert pressure repeatedly. Later, the property rights were transferred to the enemy-affiliated China Revitalization Co., Ltd. (Yangxing) for custody, causing repeated harassment. After the victory, Zhou Wenji, the legal representative of the Star Perfumery Factory (founded by Zhou Bangjun), has not changed her old ways and still hopes to repeat her past tactics. The school rents seven buildings in total and has sincerely offered to sign a lease with her, but Zhou only agrees to a six-month lease and requires a monthly rent of 70,000 yuan per building. Such a high rent is rare and her ulterior motives are self-evident. Now she has formally filed a lawsuit, scheduled to be heard on the morning of the 19th. The schools and the Shanghai Education Association School Building Maintenance Association are jointly advocating for justice and have jointly submitted a petition to the Shanghai District Court for relief.

The Nanjing Office of the Battlefield Youth Recruitment and Training Committee has recently discovered that some public and private students in various places are attempting to obtain public funding by confusing the situation. It has specifically requested the Municipal Education Bureau to instruct the principals of public and private middle schools that students are not allowed to leave school without reason, and certificates are not to be issued arbitrarily.

The Chen You Cup Basketball Tournament, Group A, is nearing its end. Tonight's two games, as usual, will start at 5:30 PM. The first game is Donghua vs. Xiexing. Judging from their records, the latter is expected to win. However, Donghua's hard-working style is well-known, and an upset is not impossible. Xiexing's players must be careful.

Starting at 6:30 PM, Shan Team will meet Green Forest. Besides tonight's game, Shan Team only has the final decisive battle against Hualian left. The team has won all eight games and is arrogant and invincible. The young players of Green Forest have also been improving rapidly, and their strength should not be underestimated.

Wu Chengzhang of Hualian shot first, breaking the basket. Bao Songtu followed up with a successful shot. Chen Tieyan of Black and White refused to be outdone and also scored. Zhang Liangxiong and Xu Jusheng of Hualian suddenly became active, and Black and White fell behind. After Hualian led 14 to 4, Hualian neglected defense, and the visiting team took the opportunity to rise. Therefore, at the end of the first half, Hualian only led by one point, 18 to 17.

After switching sides, Li Zhenzhong of Hualian took the field, and his momentum increased sharply, scoring seven points in a row. Black and White only scored through Chen Tieyan.

### Memories of Returning to Jiaotong University

— Yang Yusheng

On this New Year's afternoon, I leisurely walked near the gate of Jiaotong University, stopped by the bridge, and couldn't help but recall the chaotic and panicked scenes that occurred on this bridge in November 1937, when the National Army retreated westward. At that time, many of our lower-level employees were running around in a hurry, trying to rescue school property. The off-campus dormitory, located on the edge of the former French Concession in Shanghai, suddenly became a warehouse for miscellaneous goods. The Guangxi soldiers standing guard at the corner of Haig Road and Hongqiao Road stared blankly at the crowds of people coming and going, frequently entering and leaving the barbed wire, filled with chaotic, panicked, and uneasy emotions. Now, nine years later, I have returned to the old place, and seeing the crowds gathered in front of the school gate, smiling, all happy, surviving the disaster, the feeling is doubly increased!

Stepping Through the School Gate of Eight Years Ago, I read the long banner welcoming Jiaotong University alumni, and dragged a group of children through the palace-style gate walls that I had not dared to look at directly for eight years. I don't know where the long row of bamboo fences perpendicular to the school gate has gone? The first and second eastern dormitories and the girls' dormitory still stand dilapidatedly. I skillfully entered the No. 5 dormitory in the second eastern dormitory, where I had lived for seven or eight years, the birthplace of two children. The doors and windows were completely destroyed, and the floor was incomplete. It was truly a scene of desolation. I can still imagine the location of the wooden cabinets, chairs, tables, and many scattered objects that I did not have time to move when I fled in a hurry. Several rows of new houses in a 口 shape have been added to the South Model playground. The bronze statue of Sheng Xuanhuai in the school is probably turned into bullets now. The old music classroom is still intact. The school road, which was not completed with asphalt paving ten years ago, is still a piece of yellow earth. The South Dormitory has been leveled and no longer exists. The gymnasium has become a stable. The isolation room is full of Japanese prisoners, who are noisy and laughing, as if they have forgotten the shame of defeat. The Ferguson sports field, which was originally a shallow grassland, vast and far-reaching, is now dirty and desolate, full of traces of enemy riding.

Dusty, Gray, Withered, and Pitiful The Zhixin West Residence, formerly known as the Palace, is dusty, gray, withered, and pitiful. The engineering hall also has incomplete doors and windows and four obvious cracks. The more complete one is Rong Hong Hall, which has not lost its former appearance. The face of the big clock on the clock tower of the Upper Institute has a skylight. Ten years ago, someone surveyed the entire building and believed that the wall foundation was tilted and would collapse soon. In the past eight or nine years, it has been able to stand still, becoming an incredible miracle. The appearance of the Middle Institute has changed slightly, and although it has been painted, it still cannot compensate for its aging state. Most of the teachers' residences in the one, two, and three-entrance Western-style houses are eroded and damaged, with no sign of their former spirit. Several new houses have appeared on the tennis court. The library is still nestled against the earthen mountain, with dry tears and an empty stomach, eagerly hoping that people will give it nourishing food. I toured the entire school for a week, wandered around, paid my respects, and compared the present with the past. I truly felt like I was in another world!

The Scene That Day Was Extremely Chaotic Standing on the stone steps of the library, I looked up at the sky and recalled that on November 9, 1937, enemy planes flew horizontally and vertically, bombing the Xujiahui and Longhua stations, intending to threaten the transportation of the National Army's retreat. The planes flew low, passing over the clock tower of the Upper Institute. In groups of three or five, the sound shook the soul. The panic in the whole school was beyond description. At that time, all the heavy machines in the school that could be dismantled were transported elsewhere, but the surveying and various small experimental instruments, and all the appliances in the offices, were not transported in time. Because the school was located in the area of the road built beyond the border, there was a danger of falling at any time. Chinese people have always been known for protecting themselves wisely. The whole school suddenly fell into a state of anarchy. Our middle and lower-level employees each acted on our own, requesting small workers from the General Affairs Office in order to rush to transport objects. The number of small workers was not large to begin with, but at this time, it was even more insufficient to allocate, and the urgency of the situation increased its crisis every second. In a state of panic and helplessness, I rushed to the South Model Middle School, which had been converted into a refugee camp, and pulled more than a dozen young men, who were given subsidies by the General Affairs Office and instructed to help transport things. The day was short and the night followed.

Sighing at Each Other, Unable to Do Anything After such chaos for a few days, the French Concession authorities agreed with the enemy that all Jiaotong University school property, those inside were not allowed to go out, and those outside were not allowed to enter. French and Japanese police were stationed at the school gate, prohibiting the removal of objects. School personnel had moved to the school's off-campus dormitory to work, separated by Haig Road, staring blankly at the school gate. Many daily necessities had not been completely rescued. We sighed at each other, unable to do anything. Because I lived on campus, I had not been able to rent a house off campus. Only when the situation was critical did I take my wife and children, take some boxes, suitcases, and bedding, and take refuge in the off-campus dormitory, entering the school during the day to cook, and leaving the school at night to sleep outside. There were still many objects that had not been taken out, and public justice and personal feelings were intertwined in my mind. At this time, Li Shuhe, the dean living in the three-entrance Western-style house, moved out with his family. There were still scattered objects in the house. A complete set of rosewood chairs and tables was stored on the fourth floor of the Middle Institute, which was quite valuable and could not be moved out. He repeatedly entrusted the law, almost in despair, when he suddenly met a graduating student, Huang Zhangbin, who took advantage of his job in a Western construction company to borrow a British merchant's truck and hire a White Russian as a driver at a high price.

Drifting, Deprived, Destitute, and Helpless At a certain noon, many small workers were pre-stationed at the road test laboratory, engineering hall, civil engineering department, and three-entrance Western-style house, waiting for the opportunity to rush to transport. Huang and I waited for the gate guards to be slightly relaxed, and drove straight in, urgently loading all the equipment from the road test laboratory out of the school, via Xiafei Road, Yaozhujiao Road, and Taistolang Road, to the side gate of the off-campus dormitory, unloading and driving away as we went. Then, we entered the school and loaded out many pieces of woodenware from the engineering hall. Then, we entered the Middle Institute and snatched out more than a dozen chairs and tables. Because there were too many appliances waiting to be loaded, the truck body was still not big enough. It was estimated that my furniture would be loaded on the fourth trip. At this time, more and more units in the school came to contact us to transport objects. People were moving, running, and shouting. The French police pretended to be deaf and dumb, but the Japanese army was obviously irritated. When the truck entered the school for the fourth time, it was blocked, and the White Russian driver was slapped. We escaped in the meantime, and after that, we could not enter the school. Wandering on the street, I saw the clothes and comforters I had left in the Second East Dormitory being taken out and sold by someone I didn't know, and I could only stare blankly. Thanks to the understanding of the former French Concession authorities, our school was able to move to the basement and fourth-floor classrooms of Aurora University, and we hastily resumed classes. From this time on, we middle and lower-level employees, who could not disassemble words or practice boxing, lived an extremely difficult life of drifting, deprivation, destitution, and helplessness.

The Sky Shines Again, Thrilled to Frenzy Fortunately, the sky shines again, allowing me to return to the school gate, to affectionately and lovingly wander in every place worth commemorating, watching the cars, tricycles, and group buses carrying a large number of alumni, flooding into the Wenzhi Hall and Rong Hong Hall like a tide, signing, having tea, holding meetings, laughing, I truly felt thrilled to frenzy! Or perhaps because the environment has worn me down too much in the past eight or nine years, they no longer recognize me, and I am too lazy to greet them. I unintentionally met several groups of employees who were eager to restore the school. They asked me very kindly what news I had. I said, haven't we all found jobs? That's enough to be proud of. Because I couldn't comfort their enthusiasm, I hurriedly dragged a group of children out of the school gate in a mood of regret and nostalgia. Behind me, a whirlwind suddenly rose and conveyed the enthusiastic and violent applause from the Wenzhi Hall.

### Methods for Converting Puppet Currency Capital: Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Submits Opinions by Telegram; Former Shareholders May Pay Additional New Shares

Regarding the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce's preparation of methods for converting puppet currency capital, it telegraphed the Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Economic Affairs yesterday, stating: "We believe that since Shanghai's industry and commerce were forced to use puppet currency in recent years, the value has fluctuated frequently, and the situation is extremely complex. How to convert back to legal tender has a significant impact on the interests of industry and commerce. Our Chamber's Industrial and Commercial Laws and Regulations Research Committee has repeatedly invited representatives from various industries and relevant experts to conduct thorough research. On December 3rd of last year, we submitted Document No. 161 to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs for preliminary filing, with the intention of submitting a request for adoption after reaching a conclusion.

Based on Estimated Net Asset Value: Now, after collecting opinions from various research sessions and considering both facts and legal principles, we have summarized them into five points: (1) If the capital was originally legal tender and later converted to puppet currency, but the capital was not increased or decreased, the capital should be restored to its original amount in legal tender. (2) If the capital was originally legal tender and later converted to puppet currency, and the puppet currency capital was increased, the net value of the existing assets should be estimated in legal tender. If this net value is sufficient to cover the original amount of the book value of the puppet currency capital, it may be converted to legal tender at the original puppet currency amount. If it is insufficient, the investors should supplement it with sufficient legal tender or reduce the capital amount. (3) If the capital was puppet currency from the beginning, it should be handled in accordance with the second item above. (4) For companies that increased capital after August 13, 1937, former shareholders who were unable to participate in the subscription of new shares may, within a specified time limit, supplement the new share payments in proportion to the original capital and the currently determined capital amount. Those who are unwilling to supplement or underpay will be allowed to do so. (For example, if a company's original capital was 500,000 yuan, and it later increased to 5 million yuan, and the current estimated value determines the capital to be 5 million yuan, and a shareholder's original old shares were 50,000 yuan, and they were unable to subscribe for new shares at the time of the capital increase due to transportation difficulties, they may now supplement the new share payment of 450,000 yuan within a specified time limit, expanding the company's capital to 5.45 million.)

Old Shareholders' Meeting as the Main Body of the Company: (5) However, before the new and old shareholders have completed the registration procedures for capital increase and reorganization in accordance with the provisions of (2) and (4), the old shareholders' meeting shall remain the main body of the company. When disputes arise between the new and old shareholders regarding their rights and limits, they shall be handled in accordance with the Company Law and other relevant laws and regulations. New shareholders who are unwilling to participate in the reorganized company will also be allowed to withdraw. Their withdrawn shares will be assumed or transferred by the old shareholders, or the total capital of the company will be reduced. Regarding the above points, we hereby respectfully submit this special telegram, hoping that you will review and approve it for implementation, as it is truly for the public convenience. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce kowtows. (15th)

### Bai Chongxi Will Arrive in Shanghai Today

### Director of the External Intelligence Department, He Fengshan, Arrives in Shanghai

He Fengshan, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, arrived in Shanghai on the 15th of this month. Yesterday afternoon at 3 o'clock, he met with reporters and stated: "Regarding the illegal return of the French traitor Jacques Coppin by the French warship 'Dumont d'Urville,' the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has received a report and has made a serious protest to the French Embassy in China. The Sino-French relationship has always been close, and this action by the French side is unwise." Subsequently, when reporters asked whether incidents such as Allied soldiers in China being drunk and disorderly or causing accidents while driving should be handled by the Allied military authorities in China, Director He replied: "These incidents should be handled by the Allied military authorities in accordance with the law. This is an international practice based on the principle of mutual respect and mutual benefit. For example, if similar incidents occur in India and Burma involving our expeditionary forces, the authorities in India and Burma will also send the offending officers to our side for handling. This cannot be equated with consular jurisdiction." Director He continued: "I will be staying in Shanghai for about ten days this time, and I am eager to meet with people from all walks of life in the Allied countries to discuss issues related to diplomacy."

### Military Uniforms Must Not Be Disordered: Non-Military Personnel Are Prohibited from Wearing Khaki Uniforms

If they are not stored by the deadline and are still worn, the local gendarmerie will strictly prohibit them in accordance with the order. The above items, in addition to ordering subordinates to strictly inspect and thoroughly enforce them, are hereby publicly announced. Commander Zhang Zhen, Deputy Commander Wu Tianhe.

### American to Return Seized Enemy Wharves and Warehouses to China for Public Use

[This Newspaper News] Most of the enemy wharves and warehouses in this city are currently being used by the American military. It is now learned that the relevant authorities have reached an agreement with the American military to return all of them to the Chinese authorities before the end of this month. It is rumored that the Executive Yuan has also approved that the returned enemy wharves and warehouses be managed by the customs for public use by various shipping companies to berth ships and store goods.

Now, with the takeover of the wharves of the former Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council, the total number of floating wharves managed is 30, the number of fixed wharves is 160, and there is only one warehouse. These wharves have been occupied by the enemy and puppets for eight years, and the damage has reached more than 80%.

### Temporary Suspension of the Takeover of the Victory Ship: Crew Asks for Revised Treatment

[This Newspaper News] The second batch of Liberty ships (the Victory ship) prepared to be taken over by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, originally scheduled to take over one ship first yesterday, named the "Hai Su," originally the "Qichita Falls." On December 30 of last year, it loaded relief supplies from the United States to Shanghai. After unloading, it moved to the Pujiang River in front of the Qiuxin Iron Works in Nanshi. The remaining Liberty ships and the Victory ship are also moored there, awaiting transfer orders. At 10:00 a.m. yesterday, the crew members assembled on time at Pier 3, carrying their personal belongings, waiting quietly for departure. The company also assigned the Guoli launch to specially carry the recipients. Waiting until 11:30 a.m., due to the salary issues of senior crew members, the Navigation Association and the Marine Engineering Association jointly negotiated with the company to improve the situation. Until 4:00 p.m., they still did not get anywhere, so they all left one after another, and the takeover work was suspended due to the crew's salary issues. As for the captains' names of the six Victory ships, the first four ships were announced the day before yesterday, and the captains of the "Hai E" and "Hai Xiang" were announced yesterday. The "Hai E" is Shen Dacai, and the "Hai Xiang" is Zhu Shaogang.

Four Ocean Liners Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday: According to news from the transportation industry yesterday, the four ocean liners transferred to China by the United States, the "Horton," "Philadelphia," "Orchard," and "Fall," have arrived. However, the relevant parties receiving the ships have not yet received a telegram from the United States, so the takeover has not yet been carried out. These four ships are oil tankers, each with a capacity of about 3,000 tons.

American Liner Sails Directly from Shanghai to New York: The Sino-American Pacific route, after the Victory, is operated by the American President Lines, the Flay Shipping Company, and the American Mainstay Shipping Company. Traffic has been open for a long time. However, most of them are cargo ships, with Seattle as the starting and ending point. It is now learned that the "Onwaro" of the American President Lines is scheduled to sail directly from Shanghai to New York on the 22nd. This ship is the first ship from Shanghai to New York after the Victory. The "Pickelman" (transliteration) of the Flay Shipping Company arrived in Shanghai from Seattle yesterday, berthing at the Mitsubishi Wharf in front of the north end of the Waibaidu Bridge, with 180 passengers and no cargo, and is also the first passenger ship on the Sino-American route.

Yangtze River Shipping Increases Shallow Water Fee: The water level of the Yangtze River is receding very quickly. According to the shipping industry, a telegram was received from Hankou yesterday that the water level yesterday receded another three inches compared to the previous day, totaling four feet and four inches. When the Chengping ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was launched and passed the Madang blockade line on the 15th, it was found that the bottom of the ship made metallic noises. With a water level of twelve feet, navigation was difficult, and cargo was loaded at half capacity. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Sanbei Company increased the shallow water fee by 50% yesterday. Once the river water rises, the shallow water fee will be canceled immediately.

Yisheng Company Expands Shipping Business: The Minsheng Industrial Company is currently planning to establish a large-scale new shipyard. In the near future, the company authorities will fly to the United States to negotiate with the "Shipbuilding King" Kaiser Shipyards to purchase the latest shipbuilding and repair machinery for application. The Shanghai branch has also recently negotiated with the Dredging Bureau to find suitable factory sites in the Pudong area and actively prepare for the construction of the factory. The US government, in order to assist the company in its reconstruction work, has agreed to lend a huge sum of US$15 million for the purchase of ships. As for the original plan to purchase 18 ships from Canada, in addition to the four ships that can sail directly to China, the remaining ships still need to be assembled and constructed, which is time-consuming and lengthy. Therefore, it is now considering pre-leasing several existing ships to sail to China for urgent use. Recently, it has also reached an agreement with Jardine Matheson, a British company, to lease its wharves and warehouses along the Yangtze River, including Yichang, Hankou, Jiujiang, Wuhu, Nanjing, and Zhenjiang, for berthing and storage. Currently, the shipping rates are designated by the Ship Allocation Committee, mainly between Yichang and Hankou. The "Minyi" ship that came to Shanghai from Hankou and the "Minhe" ship that arrived in Shanghai from Yichang yesterday, in addition to loading a portion of public goods, were both here for repairs and did not carry passengers or cargo.

### Legal Dispute Between French Water and Electricity Workers Continues; Mayor Qian Hopes for Immediate Resolution

The strike by French water and electricity workers worsened suddenly yesterday morning. The labor side firmly stated their unwillingness to cooperate with capitalists who colluded with the enemy and puppets, while the company authorities, prioritizing their own interests, cut off electricity to all tram lines. The Municipal Party Committee and the Social Bureau are still continuing mediation efforts. Military and police authorities, in order to maintain local security, dispatched officers to Rue Cardinal Mercier (呂班路) and Avenue Dubail (薛華立路) all day to maintain strict vigilance and prevent disturbances. The situation is as follows:

Electricity Cutoff Disrupts Traffic: Starting at 6:00 AM yesterday, the company, citing the significant impact on revenue from long-term free tram rides, devised a plan to cut off electricity to all tram lines, causing both trams and trolleybuses to be unable to leave the depot, bringing traffic almost to a standstill. Subsequently, with emergency efforts by workers, twenty red public buses were dispatched, assigned to routes 1, 24, 22, 18, and 4, with nine buses on route 22, five on route 1, three on route 18, and three on route 24. However, they continued to refuse to sell tickets.

Labor Expresses Unwillingness to Cooperate: Labor representatives Zhu Junxin and others stated that the French water and electricity authorities colluded with the enemy and puppets during the Shanghai occupation. Therefore, they firmly expressed their unwillingness to cooperate with the capitalists again, unless the Chinese government takes back this public utility and manages it itself, in which case they would resume work unconditionally.

Military and Police Deployed for Strict Vigilance: The Social Bureau, the Municipal Party Committee, and others convened labor and management yesterday for negotiations, but no result was achieved by evening. Military and government authorities, in order to maintain security, dispatched personnel led by Chen Tongyao of the Garrison Command, Zhu Hongyu of the Police Bureau, and Zhou Shangyi of the Taishan Precinct to the scene for vigilance.

Workers Submit Nine Demands: Over 2,500 workers of the French Water and Electricity Company of this city previously submitted nine demands to the factory management:

(1) December wages must not be further reduced.

(2) A bonus of 20 days more than last year should be issued. The already issued 30 days is not satisfactory.

(3) The regulations for annual increases in basic wages and for increasing basic wages to the specified level within the prescribed years should be implemented according to the stipulated standards, and the statistical table should be published.

(4) For employees with salaries of over 120 yuan, the salary calculation method should be based on the cost of living index.

(5) The matter of allocating premises for the trade union, which has already been approved, should be promptly implemented.

(6) The approved cancellation of the contract labor system in the accounting section of the Transportation Department should be implemented immediately, and the service of the 31 personnel in that section should not be suspended.

(7) The 20 dismissed unemployed workers should be given priority for re-employment.

(8) Clarification should be provided regarding the lack of standards for issuing annual bonuses and the inexplicable deductions.

(9) Meter reading personnel in the Business Department should be issued winter and summer uniforms.

Mayor Hopes for Resumption of Ticket Sales: At 3:00 PM yesterday, Mayor Qian, along with Ge Kexin, Acting Director of the Social Bureau, and Wang Xianqing, member of the Municipal Party Committee, convened labor and management for mediation. Shen Baokui, representative of the Public Utilities Bureau, Wang Zhengmin, specialist of the Ministry of Social Affairs, Li Jianhua, Director of the Labor Department of the Social Bureau, and Zhu Hongyu and Zhou Shangyi, representatives of the Police Bureau, were all in attendance. Acting Director Ge first conveyed Mayor Qian's wishes, hoping that the labor side would resume ticket sales today, and that the management side would open the electricity supply, allowing the trams to continue running. Unresolved matters would be handled by the Social Bureau. Wang Xianqing also advised the employees to resume work first. Kurtley, Director of Personnel of the management side, stated that the labor side's demand for a two-month annual bonus was unacceptable and said that the company's administration was conducted in accordance with the authorities' intentions. Subsequently, after deliberation by Committee Member Wang and others, a compromise solution was reached: employees would borrow one month's salary from the company in advance and repay it in installments, but the management side did not agree. The meeting continued until around 6:00 PM with no results. Acting Director Ge and Committee Member Wang will consult with Mayor Qian and then conduct further mediation.

### Shanghai National Goods Factories Association Cables Consultative Conference, Requesting Emphasis on Economic Recovery

The Shanghai National Goods Factories Association telegraphed all members of the Political Consultative Conference yesterday, stating: "At a time when all countries in the world are working to maintain lasting peace after the war, we are pleased to hear that the National Government authorities will also convene a Political Consultative Conference in the wartime capital of Chongqing on the 10th of this month, to gather excellent plans for reconstruction and nation-building, and lay the foundation for universal politics.

### American Soldiers Demanding to Return Home Organize Soldiers' Committee; General Wedemeyer Has Approved It

The marches and demonstrations by American soldiers demanding to return home began with the arrival of the US Senate investigation team and ended with the departure of US Secretary of the Army Patterson. Most of those demanding to return home this time are soldiers working in the air force. They are all career soldiers who enlisted during the war and are completely different from the standing army of the United States, so they urgently hope to return home after the war.

Specifically Studying Return Matters: General Eisenhower's speech in Congress on the 14th of this month clearly stated that anyone with enough points can leave the army in April this spring. After this speech was published, the soldiers knew that they would have to wait a while longer, but as a result of discussions by these more than 700 soldiers over the past few days, they have formed a soldiers' committee dedicated to studying the matter of returning home, which has been approved by General Wedemeyer, and they will meet once a week. The committee also issued a founding declaration, stating the reasons why they demand to return home, namely that they have nothing to do in China, which makes perfect sense. However, the senior American authorities here do not seem to be paying much attention to these aftereffects.

Number of Officers and Soldiers in the US Headquarters: According to a report from US headquarters, there are currently 1,081 American officers and soldiers in the US China Theater Command headquarters. And the most interesting proportion is that among these thousand people, there are six generals and six corporals. The six generals are General Wedemeyer, General Casey, General Matte, General Middleton, General Landrum, and General Binkley. Except for General Landrum, who works in Chongqing, the other five all work at the US headquarters in Shanghai. The other numbers are as follows: 69 colonels, 63 lieutenant colonels, 75 majors, 110 captains, 145 first lieutenants, 87 second lieutenants, 2 warrant officers, 24 master sergeants, 104 staff sergeants, 10 mechanics, 35 technicians third class, 75 sergeants, 68 corporals, 78 technicians fifth class, and 34 privates second class. The above report does not include the air force stationed in China, that is, the thousands of air force personnel led by General Stratemeyer are not counted.

### High Court Tries Two Cases of Traitors

The Case of Didingas Leibenson

[Reported by This Newspaper] Yesterday morning, the Special Criminal Tribunal of the High Court, presided over by Presiding Judge Liu Yugui, opened investigative hearings for two cases. One was the case of Didingas Leibenson, a Lithuanian who was the owner of the Didingas cafe. He was reported for selling arms for the enemy during the Anti-Japanese War and for investigating whether civilians had wireless radios and secretly reporting to the enemy gendarmerie, so he was arrested by our regular bureau. Yesterday, Leibenson testified in court that he had been operating a car business in Shanghai from 1939 to 1942. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, he was detained twice by the Japanese gendarmerie. The first time was in 1942, because his parents were both in the United States, he was accused of being a spy and detained for 40 days. The second time was in 1943, because he had US$10,000 in assets in Didingas, he was detained for 60 days. He denied selling arms for the Japanese gendarmerie, investigating wireless radios hidden by civilians, and reporting to the Japanese gendarmerie to detain the American Rosenbaum. He also claimed that the businesses he has operated in recent years have nothing to do with the Japanese gendarmerie, and there are witnesses who can be called to testify, so he was actually falsely accused. The court ordered him to be remanded in custody pending the summoning of witnesses for further questioning.

Ren Zhenchu Extorts Money Through Intimidation: The other defendant was Ren Zhenchu, director of the Yuanda Rice Store, from Shengxian County, Zhejiang Province, who lives in Zhujing. He was recently reported by the authorities for treason and extortion and was transferred to the High Prosecutor's Office for prosecution. The reason was that Ren had a teacher-student relationship with Hu Baosheng, an intelligence officer of the escaped Japanese gendarmerie in western Shanghai, and was familiar with the Japanese gendarme Takeda, so he took on the intelligence work for the team, possessing pistols and bullets. And in July of last year, he extorted 250,000 yuan in puppet currency from residents of the Jin family's residence, Shen Zhongmin, Shen Lianfu, and others. After the victory, due to strict searches, he sold the guns and ammunition and was arrested by Li Shaoshan, a patrol officer from the Zhenru branch of the police station, and transferred to the prosecutor's office. But Ren denied everything in court yesterday, except for admitting to selling guns and ammunition. He also claimed that the 250,000 yuan in puppet currency was borrowed from Shen Xiaomin and was not obtained through extortion. The court ordered a postponement for further questioning, and the defendant was remanded in custody.

The traitor case of Zhang Qipin will be heard at 10:00 AM today.

### Four Foreigners Convicted by Our Courts for Violating the Law

[Reported by This Newspaper] The cases of Austrian Frank, German Katz, and Polish Borowiec selling American pistols privately, and British student Fleet selling American rifles privately, were all arrested by the police and handed over to the court. At 3:30 PM the day before yesterday, Judge Cai Jin of the Second Criminal Division of the District Court simultaneously opened the trial. The defendants confessed to the charges, but said that they did not know that this was illegal in advance, so they requested leniency. Judge Cai announced in court that Frank and Katz were each fined 20,000 yuan, Borowiec was sentenced to three months in prison, and Fleet was fined 215,000 yuan. It is said that this is the first time a British person has been tried in our court.

### Progress in the Fishing Achievements of the China Aquatic Products Company

The China Aquatic Products Company of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry was established in mid-December, and its fishing boats have repeatedly gone out to sea and have gained a lot. There are three cold storage warehouses, Huahai, Huapu, and Huaji, which are being rushed to repair and will be officially opened next month. In addition, the Huasheng Net Factory and the Huali Shipyard have also started operations separately, undertaking manufacturing and repair business entrusted by the fishing industry. Recently, the two ships Huali and Huaqing set sail on the 6th of this month and fished between Haijiao Island and Langgang Island, 130 nautical miles southeast of Wusongkou. They returned to Shanghai on the 16th, catching 112,000 catties, and sold them in the fish market for two days, earning 22 million yuan. It is said that this is the highest record of fishing achievements among the company's ten fishing boats since its opening.

### Li Qinian and Mei Xi Are Sued for Debt

[Reported by This Newspaper] Film stars Li Qinian and Mei Xi, when performing plays at the Meihua Grand Theater last autumn, borrowed 21 million yuan in puppet currency from Sun Weiren through Mei Xi to raise funds for the theater troupe, with Li Qinian and Xing Jiabao as guarantors. Sun Weiren has not been paid back for this debt to this day, so he entrusted lawyer Zhan Yiren to file a lawsuit with the court. At 12:00 PM yesterday morning, the Sixth Civil Division of the District Court opened the trial. Because the defendants Mei Xi and Li Qinian did not appear in court, the trial was ordered to be postponed to another date.

Spring and Autumn

### Little Lotus

— Shi Jimei

Among those dozens of girls, she is the one I cannot forget!

A smiling face, a child-like figure that has not yet fully developed, round and large eyes with a black jade-like luster, and a delicate, eloquent mouth – that was Su Xiahe. – A third-year junior high school student. When I taught them Chinese, Su Xiahe sat in the first row. This fourteen-and-a-half-year-old girl had extraordinary talent and astonishing naughtiness. In class, if she listened attentively to your lectures, she would open her black jade-like eyes wide, concentrating as if nothing in the world could distract her; her comprehension and memory were stronger than any other classmate's, she understood what others did not understand early on, and she easily remembered things others could not remember clearly. If she happened to not like listening to the lecture, she would make funny faces to make the teacher laugh, her black eyes darting back and forth like a restless kitten.

I liked her extraordinarily, although I was helpless against her extraordinary mischievousness and naughtiness. In all honesty, among the forty-odd third-year junior high school students, she was, if not the best in terms of grades, at least the most gifted; if not the most beautiful, at least the most lovable. I am confident that my assessment is not at all excessive.

Once, during a break, I was pulled by them to sit and chat in the corridor filled with sunlight. Su Xiahe asked me:

"Teacher, why is Li Bai also called Li Taibai?"

Everyone else laughed.

I also smiled and asked her back: "Why are you called Su Xiahe?"

Her large, round black eyes flashed, her face broke into a smile, and she said with a giggle: "Daddy gave me the name, I don't know why."

"You are too unlike your name, lotus flowers are the most serene of all, you are like a wild rose, or a pair of little wildcats."

"Little wildcat doesn't sound very nice, if Teacher likes me to be called Rose, I'll change my name to Rose!" she said obediently.

"That's too much trouble," I couldn't help but laugh: "Changing names requires a great deal of effort, and you even have to report it to the Education Bureau!"

"Actually, Teacher, the lotus flower is the most worthy of pride and glory," she suddenly said in a serious tone, like a little adult: "Because it blooms the most beautiful and purest flower in the dirtiest swamp."

I nodded. What she said was right, but how could this be the speech of a fourteen-and-a-half-year-old child? So I felt a bit anxious for this precocious student, an inexplicable concern, which I gradually forgot afterwards.

I only worked at that school for half a year, and then I left. That half year of life gave me infinitely deep memories, and there was not a single memory in which I did not think of that child, that smiling face, with black jade-like eyes, the eloquent Su Xiahe!

Such a lovable child should be happy.

Who knew that one afternoon two months ago, she came to my place to see me, telling me that she was no longer studying, and had been out of school for half a year, because her father could not afford the tuition fees for too many children, so Xiahe finished junior high school and did not enter senior high school.

"However, if things stop going up so much in price, or if Daddy has a better income, I can still go to school next semester." Xiahe explained, with a hint of self-consolation; she was not at all depressed, still had a smiling face, still had a pair of black jade-like bright eyes, and was taller than before.

Before leaving, she left a small packet of candy wrapped in red and green transparent paper, smiling shyly: "This is for you, Auntie gave it to me and my younger brother yesterday, I divided it in half; now I'll divide half of that for you."

Before she finished speaking, she ran off.

I felt melancholy, melancholy, incomparably melancholy. Dusk passed, darkness invaded the room, I turned on the light, sat alone, pondered, and pondered again, eating the candy the child had left behind, wondering if it was sweet? Or bitter?…

Two months passed so quickly, and it was time for the term exams again. What followed was the payment of retention fees, the winter vacation, the payment of tuition fees, the purchase of books, and then a new semester began.

I thought of Xiahe, why hadn't she come again? I also thought of her schooling problem this semester. Prices two months later were not lower than they had been two months earlier. Now, I could only hope that her father would have a better income.

However, Xiahe remained silent and without news, and I did not have her address.

Until yesterday, I received a letter from another student, who told me this news: "Teacher, I think everyone who loves Xiahe will shed tears when they know, especially you, because you cherished her like a sister, how pitiful! Our little wildcat, little Rose, because of the pressure of life, because of the driving of the environment, she went to a restaurant to work as a hostess, the day before yesterday evening I went to find her, she was out, Xiahe's mother told me all this with tears in her eyes, and repeatedly told me not to tell others, it's embarrassing, people will laugh at her… Teacher, I know you won't laugh at her, so I'm telling you…"

I had no tears, not because I didn't love Xiahe, but because the emotions in my heart were even more indescribably painful than shedding tears. I read that letter over and over again, hoping that all these things were false, but unfortunately the student who wrote the letter was a very honest child.

No wonder Xiahe hadn't come again these days, she was afraid of being embarrassed, she was afraid that her teacher would laugh at her for being a hostess. Ah! Silly child, although you are clever, you are still young after all, is your teacher so insensible?

I hope to see her again, even if it's only once, I hope that when I see her again, she will still have that smiling face, still have those black jade-like bright eyes, and still be so innocent and genuine.

However, is this possible?

No one can answer this simple question, perhaps only heaven knows. I looked up, looking at the sky outside the window, the sky was bluer than ever before, without clouds, only a piece of incomparably glorious good sun; I then realized that I was sitting in the sunshine, so I thought of all the past events in the sunshine, that only half year of educational life, and that day in the corridor filled with sunlight, sitting with a large group of girls…

"Teacher, the lotus flower is the most worthy of pride and glory, because it blooms the most beautiful and purest flower in the dirtiest swamp." I thought of Xiahe's words. Admirable good child! You are a hundred times better than your inexperienced teacher, to be able to say such words, you must also understand the reason in the words, you will not forget how to survive in the swamp, and how to bloom the most beautiful and purest flower! I believe you will not fail your name, which is both proud and glorious!

### The Techniques and Materials of Poetry Recitation

— Zhu Jiang

In recent years, poetry has been moving towards the path of recitation. We know that poetry recitation meetings have been held in Wuhan, Chongqing, and Shanghai... Recently, there was also a poetry recitation program in the first literary evening party of the Shanghai literary and art circles. However, on the whole, the results of recitation are not very good. The reasons for this can be divided into two aspects:

1.  The problem of recitation techniques; 2. The problem of recitation materials.

Many poets can only write with a pen, but are not good at chanting. Once they are asked to take the stage to recite, the results are naturally not impressive. Many poets cannot speak Mandarin. Once they start reciting, the southern accents and northern tones are mixed up, which is very easy to cause ridicule. I remember a poet reciting a poem about Gorky. The tone was very leisurely, but because it was Jiangbei Mandarin, the audience laughed at his Jiangbei accent instead of paying attention to the content he was reciting.

Poets are most likely to transcend reality. Poets who transcend reality do not have enough life experience, and often have no way to experience or grasp the complex emotions of joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness contained in the poetic meaning. This is another reason why recitation is not good. If a poet is a layman in drama and music, then it is difficult to ask him to be able to recite beautifully and movingly.

The above is about the problem of recitation techniques. To solve this problem, poets must work hard to practice their eloquence, learn Mandarin, participate in and experience real life, accept the techniques of drama, and deepen their musical cultivation.

A skilled woman cannot cook without rice, nor can a skilled woman cook rotten rice into fragrant rice. Even if poets have excellent recitation skills, it is in vain if they do not have suitable recitation materials.

Poets are often obsessed with the beauty of words and the peculiarity of forms, and are unwilling to read it aloud themselves, listen with their ears, or let the public read and listen. It is impossible to imagine that such poems will move the audience when they are recited. Poets are often the darlings of heaven, transcending as if they do not eat human fireworks. Their minds are filled with flowers, moons, beauties, wine... They capture the inspiration that flashes by like a wisp of smoke and write it into masterpieces. Such works are wonderful, but it is too difficult for them to be understood by audiences who rub against real life! Poets are even geniuses, who do not need to study or revise. They only need to let their inspiration gallop on paper along the tip of their pen, without paying attention to syllables or rhymes, and even arranging prose in a broken manner on paper! It is conceivable that it is difficult to ask such works to be recited and understood.

To achieve good results in poetry recitation, the following must be done:

1.  The poem recited must be able to represent the voice of the audience, so it is easy to be accepted and arouse resonance.

2.  The content of the poem recited must be closely related to the audience's life. They will not be interested in smoke-like inspiration.

3.  The language of the poem must be as close as possible to the audience's spoken language. The masses cannot enjoy profound and noble things!

4.  The structure of the poem is not too peculiar, the sentences are not too long, not Europeanized, and the words are not remote.

5.  Although it is not necessary to talk about level tones and antithetical couplets, at least the syllables should be smooth and the rhymes should be loud.

The above are the five lowest requirements for poetry recitation in terms of materials.

Poetry recitation is a kind of artistic performance. Poetry recitation is more monotonous and less easy to please than other artistic performances such as drama, film, singing, and dance. Therefore, to achieve good results in poetry recitation, it is necessary to cultivate and prepare a lot in both skills and materials!

Pen and Ink Chronicles

### A Joint Discussion on Coughing and Spitting Phlegm

— Murong Sui

"When about to ascend the hall, the voice must be raised." A sound of "Ahem" gives people a preparation in advance, which is etiquette. Coughing is in accordance with etiquette, which is why coughing must be learned. Coughing is close to the Dao! "Spitting without looking" is the righteous anger of those filled with indignation. Spitting phlegm is in accordance with nurturing, which is why spitting phlegm must be learned. Phlegm is close to the Dao!

"The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao." Understanding it spiritually depends on the person!

The teacher stands on the podium to teach; the students are dozing off in the lecture hall! "Is my Dao exhausted?" Not yet. A sound of "Ahem" startles the student, and then he listens as if it were the first time. Thus, "The master skillfully and patiently leads people."

"Yao offered the world to Xu You, but Xu You did not accept it." He painstakingly ran to the river to wash his ears. Isn't that stupid? If Xu You had spat out a mouthful of thick phlegm, it would have been a "first rank!" Wouldn't that be "resolute and decisive!" "Vivid and colorful!" When we read history to this point, we cannot help but "smash our spittle pot."

Living in today's world, without changing the ancient Dao, understanding it spiritually depends even more on the person!

For example, in a debate arena: you must say a few words. After standing up proudly: "Brothers, brothers… today, today…". If you still can't think of what to say, then you have to "Ahem," "Ahem," and then "Ahem" again… People will sympathize with you: "Are you not feeling well today?" Also, if what people say doesn't suit you, you can also "Ahem," "Ahem," and keep "Ahem"-ing. Its effect can at least distract people.

As for "spitting," it has even more unexpected effects. It can make people look back and walk away. If you say you oppose them, it was unintentional. If you say you sympathize with them, you have already "spit without looking." If you have tuberculosis, you can also subtly spread the bacteria and put the other party to death. It is more effective than spreading rumors. Isn't that wonderful!

Wonderful, wonderful! Wonderful to the extreme, an accidental masterpiece. This is what is called "coughing and spitting pearls!"

### Crow

— Ren Jun

"People are disliking you! Wouldn't it be better to say a few less words?"

"These are the words I want to say, this is the song I want to sing! How can I not speak because people dislike me?..."

"Then, wouldn't it be better to change your voice?"

"Friend, I dare to bet! You must have mistaken me—I am a crow of solid black, not a parrot with green feathers and a red beak!"

### A Couple Soaring Together

— Zhao Qingge

Before Old Master Mo came back, Bao Ling certainly called Madam Weng the Second "Daddy." At that time, the child also thought that maybe that was Madam Weng the Second's name, because the child did not yet quite understand the meaning of the two words "Daddy." Later, when Old Master Mo came back, Bao Ling did not know for a long time what to call him. It was still Mo Sheng who once told the child, and also explained the meaning of "Daddy" to the child. Only then did the child have a sudden realization, and so, from then on, the child no longer called Madam Weng the Second "Daddy." Because of this, the child's small head had suffered several slaps from Madam Mo. In the child's heart, the child naturally did not accept this, but the child did not dare to make a "humph" sound with the child's mouth. Based on the child's experience of the past year, "Mommy" was much more fierce than "Daddy." The child also gradually understood now why "Mommy" was more fierce than "Daddy," and why "Daddy" was so afraid of "Mommy." All of this was because Mo Sheng had told the child when Mo Sheng was free. However, the child felt that "Mommy" certainly had reason, but it was also not necessary to excessively hit a "drenched chicken." Therefore, the child was still very sympathetic towards "Daddy."

At this moment, Bao Ling was reading, reading, and suddenly noticed that Old Master Mo was sitting to the side, completely lost in thought. And so, the child could not help but stand up, and walk to the front of Old Master Mo, and say:

"Daddy, I've memorized it!"

"Ah?... Oh, good, good! Good child!"

Bao Ling's words startled Old Master Mo. Soon after, the child was awakened from his contemplative state. Once again, the child seemed to have fallen into the dreamscape of the previous night, and also felt that that string of past events was actually somewhat similar to the scene in the dream of the previous night. The child felt this was somewhat strange, but, because the child had to look after Bao Ling's lessons, the child did not temporarily have the mood to understand this in detail. And so, the child forced himself to appear calm, and turned his face toward Bao Ling, to ask:

"Then, you recite it for me to hear."

Bao Ling obediently turned around, and recited in a clear voice:

"At the beginning of man, nature is good; natures are similar, habits are far apart!"

Bao Ling had just recited the beginning, when suddenly Mo Sheng rushed in in a fluster.

"Master! Master! Madam is about to give birth! Madam is about to give birth!" Mo Sheng shouted, both surprised and delighted.

Old Master Mo was startled yet again. He suddenly stood up.

"Quickly go and invite Madam Weng the Second to come, and also, tell Madam Weng the Second to bring a midwife."

"Madam Weng the Second already came long ago, and the midwife just arrived! Right now they are very busy!" After saying that, Mo Sheng hurriedly left.

Only then did Old Master Mo let the child's heart drop. The child paced a few steps inside the room, and said excitedly to Bao Ling:

"Bao Ling, you will soon have a younger brother! Oh, do you still prefer a younger sister?"

After Old Master Mo raised this question, even the child himself felt at a loss. The child thought: "I hope to have another son, after all! Or do I want a daughter?"

"I prefer a younger sister, I don't like a younger brother." Bao Ling thought for a moment, and answered Old Master Mo.

"Correct! It would be best to give you another younger sister!" Old Master Mo said, and patted Bao Ling's head.

At this moment, Old Master Mo was very happy in his heart. The child no longer remembered what the child's mood had been when Bao Ling had initially been born.

### Two Urgent and Unavoidable Acts of Righteousness

— Editor

Ten thousand students… urgently awaiting relief

Three thousand orphans… crying for food

There are currently two acts of righteousness in Shanghai that urgently call upon people from all walks of life to contribute money and effort, the more the better! I said yesterday that the Shanghai Municipal Education Loan Committee will rescue 10,000 impoverished students from dropping out of school, and needs 100 million yuan to complete this righteous act of rescue. The winter vacation of each school is approaching, and the procedures for applying for registration will soon begin. In the blink of an eye, the spring semester will begin. May I ask, dear readers, can you bear to let these lovely young people drop out of school one morning? Dropping out of school for young people is not a loss for one person or one family, but a great loss for the country and society. If those who are well-fed and well-clothed pool a little money to take on the responsibility of teaching and relief, this very meaningful work of helping students will not be difficult to accomplish and will be of immeasurable merit.

Winter relief, now is the time! This newspaper collects donations on behalf, but the donations have not been enthusiastic, which is deeply regrettable! The ancients "sent charcoal in the snow," which has been passed down as a good story for thousands of years. I hope that enthusiastic people will see righteousness and act bravely, and enthusiastically contribute to ensure that this relief cause will not be abandoned halfway. The association currently has seven shelters, housing a total of 3,000 displaced people and orphans, providing them with food, clothing, education, and a peaceful life; street beggars, petty thieves, pickpockets, and hooligans were originally the most unbearable pranks in Shanghai. Now the authorities have taken them all in, which is indeed a commendable good governance in the ten-mile foreign settlement. To be honest, citizens should donate more to replenish the foundation and ensure that these people are educated when they are young and cared for when they are old, which is indeed a sacred obligation of Shanghai society.

Reader's Letter

### Speaking of Returning Home, Tears Fall, Internal Migration is Righteous, and the Heart is Like an Arrow

Mr. Editor: I was very moved to read the section of your newspaper's special correspondent Mr. Zhang Jun's report on the return of righteous people to their hometowns. I respectfully report my personal experience to you: I was recruited by the Central Machinery Factory in Shanghai in July of the 28th year of the Republic of China. There were leaders along the way, and people were greeted everywhere after passing through Hong Kong's defenses. My family was also sent by the factory in the 29th year. This was the good intention of the factory. In Kunming for six years, I was promoted to foreman by the factory, so I am very grateful to the factory. But in my distant hometown, there are still elderly parents around seventy years old. They spent eight years of slave life in the "ruins where the houses were burned to the ground by the enemy for clearing the countryside." In this difficult living environment, I had two children, plus my sins. The happiest thing is the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, and the reunion with the hometown I abandoned for eight years and the scattered parents and brothers. This is my only hope. It is also the only hope of us righteous people. Who knows that the flames of civil war will follow the cheers of victory, and traffic is blocked everywhere. Now, although the civil war has stopped, the national industry has plummeted, and the sad voices of layoffs and unemployment have spread everywhere. But the good news of relief and repatriation of righteous people to their hometowns has been spread all over the land by the radio of various agencies and newspapers. People in society are tired of hearing and seeing this, and only these unemployed righteous people have no way to return and no way to seek help. I hope that God will use the power of salvation to bring the opportunity of "relief and repatriation" to every unemployed righteous person. Who knows that God and the God of Wealth deliberately make trouble, they want to do the business of transporting US dollars, gold, and speculative commodities. It is impossible for the poor and unemployed righteous people to ask for the opportunity to return home. Now various hometown associations and labor associations have jointly organized the Righteous People's Homegoing Association, and I think this is the most reliable opportunity. I immediately registered with the hometown association, and it is said that there is a hope of free travel in the future, or according to the asking price of more than 10,000 yuan. I immediately went through the procedures for leaving the factory, and received the factory's severance pay and 50,000 yuan of transportation subsidies. I waited for more than ten days for the Righteous People's Homegoing Car, but there was no definite message. It is said that there are more than 100,000 righteous people in Kunming, and there are more than 3,000 righteous people registered in this period. There are only ten vehicles for repatriation, and at most only 300 people can be repatriated every day. According to this, how many years and months will it take for more than 100,000 righteous people to return to their hometowns. Today, I am borrowing a corner of your newspaper with tears to appeal to you, when will we righteous people be able to return home by car and boat? It's really killing people!

### Foreigners Disobey Laws

Mr. Editor: In Shanghai after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, although everything has progressed, the past privileges of imperialism in China and the attitude of disregarding our country's laws have not been eradicated. The writer watched a play at the Dumei Cinema yesterday. The general foreigners in the theater not only did not comply with the police station's regulations, but the smoke filled the entire theater. Even when the party and national anthem and the chairman's portrait were played, they talked and laughed freely and did not stand up (it is said that the theater sometimes does not even screen programs such as singing the party anthem). This move is really inappropriate. Please publish it in your column to promote the attention of the relevant authorities and the general public. (A reader of this newspaper)

### Published Letters

To the Editor: Having read the article "A Young Widow Appeals for Justice for Her Husband" published in your newspaper on the 13th of this month, it clearly does not accord with the facts. This branch bureau is located in western Shanghai, and during the Anti-Japanese War, it relied on the power of the enemy and puppet regime, and has long been a den of crime, known as "bad soil." After the victory and the restoration of the country, these habitual criminals still secretly set up "scalper stalls" and gambled as before. In order to maintain public order, the police bureau has issued repeated orders to prohibit smoking and gambling, supervising its subordinates to strictly enforce the law, and must eradicate it thoroughly.

Xu Xianzong, a detective in the criminal investigation section of this branch bureau, has been serving in the police bureau since the victory, and has been quite competent in his official duties. On the 25th of last December, this branch bureau received a report that there were gangsters gambling in the Wujiaochang area of Caojiadu in western Shanghai (commonly known as "scalper stalls"). It immediately sent the officer to lead plainclothes police officers disguised to go to the address to break the case, arrested 18 gamblers and prepared to escort them to the bureau. Unexpectedly, when they were being escorted onto the police car, the gambling thug Qian A-si (namely Qian Aichu) suddenly resisted and escaped. Officer Xu, being responsible for his duty, chased after him relentlessly. When he chased him to Yuanfang Lane, he caught the criminal. Unexpectedly, the criminal turned around to resist arrest, seized the gun and fought, and was shot. He was then sent to the hospital by the accompanying police officers, but the treatment was ineffective. Officer Xu had his back of his hand scratched in many places due to the fight over the gun, and the blood would not stop. Moreover, the body of the deceased was examined by the prosecutor and the forensic doctor, and it was confirmed that the bullet entered from outside the right shoulder and entered the subcutaneous tissue of the left waist. This sufficiently proves that he was shot due to the mutual twisting to seize the gun. Furthermore, Qian A-si is a well-known local bully in western Shanghai. In the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, he opened a Dang Sheng gambling house in western Shanghai. Later, he was in charge of the Hollywood gambling table, and he also set up a dragon gate stall in the Dashen Hua-Min gambling tables in Nanshi as a favorite disciple of Zhu Ni Shunlin. He has more than three previous convictions on record.

The above is the situation at the time. I hope that people in the community will uphold justice for the police officers who are dutifully searching and arresting smokers and gamblers. Otherwise, police officers in general will be discouraged. The report "A Young Widow Appeals for Justice for Her Husband" is entirely fabricated and not factual. In addition to the gambling case along with the remaining 17 criminals that have been sent to the local inspection office for legal proceedings, this letter is specially requested to be corrected, so as not to confuse the hearing. Sincerely, The Ninglu Branch of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau January 16, 35th year.
