[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] This morning, the members of the Democratic League convened an internal meeting at the Lan family residence until 11:00 AM, then went to the Bank of Communications to hold a meeting with the Youth Party and social elites. Communist Party representatives Zhou Enlai, Huang Biwu, Li Weihan, and Deng Yingchao also attended at 11:30 AM to discuss the list of National Assembly members, which concluded at 2:00 PM. Zhou Enlai then visited the U.S. Ambassador, meeting until 4:00 PM. At the same time, an informal comprehensive meeting was held at Sun Ke's residence. Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu also attended. The representatives present included Wu Tiecheng, Shao Lizi, Wang Shijie, Mo Dehui, Hu Lin, Miao Jiaming, Zeng Qi, Chen Qitian, Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, as well as the convener Sun Ke and Political Consultative Conference Secretary-General Lei Zhen, to discuss the list of National Assembly members and the draft constitution. Zhou Enlai stated at the time that both topics were currently impossible to discuss. Huang Yanpei advocated redrafting the constitution, but due to time constraints, it seemed unlikely. This informal comprehensive meeting lasted for two and a half hours. Due to the lack of concrete results, it is said that it will continue on the 13th, with the draft constitution remaining the focus of discussion.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] Social elite representative Hu Lin visited the U.S. Ambassador at 10:00 AM this morning, departing after a half-hour conversation. The Ambassador received Zhou Enlai for a lengthy discussion in the afternoon and visited Special Envoy Marshall at 5:00 PM to convey Hu's opinions. Both the U.S. Ambassador and Special Envoy Marshall are very concerned about the prospects for peace talks.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] Chairman Chiang left his official residence for Sun Ke's residence at 5:00 PM on the 12th. At that time, Sun was presiding over the comprehensive meeting. The Chairman did not enter the venue, staying for ten minutes before leaving. He then drove via Zhongshan North Road to Xiaguan Railway Station and returned after a walk along the riverbank.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] Sun Ke and Lei Zhen jointly paid a visit to the Chairman at approximately 8:00 PM on the 12th to report on the day's meeting.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] During discussions with Sun on the 12th, Zhou Enlai left early at 6:00 PM to visit Special Envoy Marshall, returning to the Meiyuan New Village after about two hours. Tonight, according to the spokesman for the Communist Party delegation, Zhou's remarks today clarified the Communist Party's position, the main points being: (1) The National Assembly should be halted immediately. If it cannot be halted, it will cause a complete rupture. The responsibility for this rupture should be borne by the government. (2) If the National Assembly is convened, it must be in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference.

Various Parties Will Nominate Candidates, Democratic League Issues Statement

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] Social elite representatives continued to work for peace on the 12th, hoping that the Youth Party and the Democratic League would submit lists of National Assembly representatives so that the National Assembly could be convened in an atmosphere of peace and unity. It is said that Li Huang will discuss the nomination of candidates in Shanghai. The Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party under the leadership of Zhang Junmai may submit lists in the short term. The Democratic League insists that everything must be done in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. If all the necessary procedures can be completed, it will naturally participate in the National Assembly. Despite various contacts today, there were still no results.

[Our Dispatch] Social Democratic Party leader Zhang Junmai, along with Jiang Yuntian and Sun Baoyi, arrived in Shanghai by night train from Nanjing on the 12th. That evening, Zhang convened a meeting of party members at the party's office on Yu Guo Road. Zhang first reported to those present on the situation of the negotiations in Nanjing and the opinions of all parties that he had learned, followed by a detailed review by everyone of the party's future attitude and an overall exchange of views. It is said that Zhang and others discussed until late into the night of the 12th without reaching a decisive result. The meeting will continue on the morning of the 13th, at which time decisions will be made regarding participation in the National Assembly and the submission of candidate lists.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] A faction of the Democratic League issued a formal statement on the National Assembly issue on the evening of the 12th, as follows: "The Democratic League has repeatedly declared its support for the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and all actions are based solely on this. We are willing to make every final effort to complete all the procedures related to the National Assembly's convening as stipulated by the Political Consultative Conference. After completion, we will unanimously participate in the National Assembly. If not completed, we will temporarily not participate."

### National Assembly Postponed by Three Days, Symbolizing a Turning Point in the Overall Situation, Xu Fulin Issues Statement to Reporters

[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Xu Fulin, Propaganda Minister of the Chinese Social Democratic Party, stated to reporters on the 12th: The government's announcement of a three-day postponement of the National Assembly's opening ceremony indicates the hope that all parties and factions can participate. Our party's Zhang Junmai, Jiang Yuntian, and Sun Baogang left Nanjing for Shanghai today to prepare for convening an important party meeting within days to discuss the attitude towards the current situation in order to provide a response to the government. As for the recent informal comprehensive meetings held in Nanjing by various parties, I am not fully aware of the content of the discussions, so I cannot report on it. When asked whether the Democratic Socialist Party would take the same approach as the Democratic League regarding participation in the National Assembly, he said: The Democratic League is composed of several parties. After each party makes its internal decision, they will collectively discuss it and make a final decision. As a member of the Democratic Socialist Party, I do not intend to interfere in the affairs of the Democratic League. When asked for his views on the three-day postponement of the National Assembly, he said: This symbolizes a turning point in the overall peaceful situation. It is hoped that all issues can be resolved within these three days, because everyone is Chinese. As long as there is peace, we may as well compromise to achieve it and eliminate prejudices. Although I am not very clear about the content of the discussions between all parties in recent days, from an overall perspective, the Third Force seems to be more practical than before. In fact, if everyone sincerely solves the problem, it does not take much time. Xu also said: The current discussion content focuses on two points: (1) the constitution, and (2) the reorganization of the government. The former must complete the Political Consultative Conference review process, then be comprehensively revised by the Legislative Yuan and submitted to the National Assembly. Regarding the latter, the government advocates reorganizing the government first, convening the National Assembly, and then reorganizing the Executive Yuan. The Communist Party advocates reorganizing the Executive Yuan first, then convening the National Assembly. However, it is yet to be seen whether a compromise solution will be proposed, such as first deciding the list for the Executive Yuan's reorganization, then convening the National Assembly, and then reorganizing the Executive Yuan, etc. I really do not know, but it is also possible. Speaking to this point, Xu added with emotion: The constitution produced by this National Assembly may not be permanently implemented, because the constitutional representatives of this National Assembly were produced ten years ago. In the future, it will inevitably be criticized by some people. At the same time, there is also the suspicion of each party dividing up the spoils, saying that it cannot represent public opinion, which is not impossible. As the saying goes, "If the name is not correct, then the words will not ring true." If the foundation is not solid, it will inevitably be shaken. But even so, "bad laws are better than no laws." It is not appropriate to practice the rule of law by "temporary regulations" in the long term. The transition from one-party tutelage to constitutional government requires a bridge. We do not need to be overly pessimistic. Xu also explained that he himself is one of the representatives of Guangdong Province. As of now, he has not yet gone to Nanjing to register. If the current situation can be resolved and everyone participates in the National Assembly, there will be no problem. If it cannot be resolved, then he will only consider his personal position and decide whether or not to register. After all, one person will not affect the meeting. Finally, Xu said: There is only a way forward for China if we are sincere with each other. At the same time, he hopes that the government can quickly improve politically. If this is achieved, the unification of the overall situation will be strengthened. According to reporters, Zhang Junmai and Jiang Yuntian may travel to Nanjing tomorrow.

### Female Representative to National Assembly from Xinjiang Province, Wu Jingbin, Arrives in Nanjing to Register

She is the Only Elected Female County Magistrate

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] Ms. Wu Jingbin, the only female county magistrate among the nation's first elected county magistrates and a representative of the Mongolian region of Xinjiang to the National Assembly, arrived in Nanjing on the 11th to register.

Ms. Wu told visiting reporters today: Women in Xinjiang have a spirit of hard work and endurance. In addition to raising children and doing housework, they also bear the majority of the family's livelihood, so there is no oppression by men. Female education in that area, relative to the number of men, is not much different from the interior. Women's rights are higher than in the interior, but there are still not many high-ranking officials.

### Brief Overview of the Production of Representatives for the First National Assembly

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] On the eve of the opening of the first National Assembly of the Republic of China, which is responsible for drafting the constitution, here is a brief overview of the process by which the representatives were produced: According to the National Assembly Representative Election Law, the original number of representatives for this assembly was 1,440, produced through four methods: regional elections, occupational elections, special elections, and government designation. Among them, regional representatives accounted for 665, occupational representatives accounted for 380, special representatives accounted for 155, totaling 1,200. The remaining 240 were designated by the National Government. In January of this year, the Political Consultative Conference agreed to the decision that of the above 1,440 representatives, the regional, occupational, and special categories, totaling 1,200, were legally valid. The 240 representatives to be designated by the government were canceled. The National Government directly selected another 700. Later, with the victory of the Anti-Japanese War and the recovery of the Northeast and Taiwan, the number was increased by 150, based on the supplementary regulations for elections and the attached schedule, including the nine provinces of the Northeast, Taiwan, and other regions, as well as female representatives and military representatives, for a total of 2,050. After the National Assembly was initially decided to be convened on November 12, 1936, the National Government issued the National Assembly Organization Law and the National Assembly Representative Election Law on May 14 of that year and set them to be implemented on July 1 of the same year. The election method combined regional and occupational elections. The number of representatives stipulated that regions account for 60 to 65 percent, and occupations account for 35 to 40 percent. Those belonging to regions were divided into electoral districts based on the population of each province and city, and voting was held. Those belonging to occupations were based on the development of various industries in the local area, with agriculture, industry, and commerce divided by province and city, and free professions based on groups, regardless of region. The allocation of quotas was based on the number of members or the scope of various industries and free professions in agriculture, industry, and commerce. Based on the above principles, elections were conducted in accordance with the law in various parts of the country in the autumn of 1936, but they could not be completed before the meeting. In October of that year, the central government decided to postpone the convening of the assembly. By July of the following year, elections in various provinces and cities, except for Hebei, Chahar, Beiping, and Tianjin, had mostly been produced in accordance with the law. The allocation of quotas was as follows: For those belonging to regions, Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, Sichuan, and Guangdong each had 44 representatives, Hunan and Hebei each had 43, Hubei had 40, Anhui had 35, Zhejiang had 33, Jiangxi had 28, Shanxi, Fujian, and Yunnan each had 22, Guangxi had 21, Shaanxi had 20, Guizhou had 16, Gansu had 14, Xinjiang had 12, Chahar and Suiyuan each had 10, Ningxia and Qinghai each had 9, Shanghai had 8, Beiping had 6, Tianjin had 5, Nanjing had 4, Qingwu and Xijing each had 2, for a total of 665. For those belonging to agricultural, industrial, and commercial professional groups, Jiangsu, Hunan, Sichuan, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and Guangdong each had 21, Hubei and Jiangxi each had 18, Anhui and Zhejiang each had 15, Shanghai had 12, Shaanxi had 11, Fujian had 9, Shanxi and Yunnan each had 8, Guizhou and Guangxi each had 7, Nanjing, Beiping, and Tianjin each had 6, Gansu had 5, Kang, Qinghai, Chahar, Suiyuan, Rehe, Xinjiang, Qingwu, and Xijing each had 3, for a total of 322. There were also 10 representatives from the free professional group of lawyers, 5 representatives from accountants, 8 representatives from medical practitioners, 11 representatives from journalists, 6 representatives from engineers, and 18 representatives from educational groups, for a total of 380. Those produced by special election methods included 45 from the Northeast, 40 from Mongolia and Tibet, 40 representatives of overseas Chinese, and 30 military representatives, for a total of 155. The regional and occupational representatives numbered 1,200, of which 950 were produced in accordance with the law in 1937. However, since then, there have been 28 vacancies, leaving an actual number of 922. These are the originally elected representatives to this assembly. According to the Political Consultative Conference agreement, the 700 representatives to be directly selected by the government included 220 from the Kuomintang, 190 from the Communist Party, 120 from the Democratic League, 100 from the Youth Party, and 70 from non-partisan individuals. Based on the supplementary regulations for elections and the attached schedule, the regional, occupational, and special representatives increased by 150, including 17 from Taiwan Province, 77 from the twelve provinces and cities of the Northeast (combined with the original 45, totaling 122), 6 from Chongqing City, 3 each from the occupational representatives of Xikang and Xinjiang, 1 from Ejin Banner, 1 from Ando Tibetan area, 1 overseas Chinese from the United Kingdom, 1 overseas Chinese from Burma originating from Yunnan, 10 indigenous minorities from the southwestern provinces, 10 military representatives, and 20 female representatives. Of all the representatives who should be produced by various methods, excluding the 410 from the Communist Party, Democratic League, and Youth Party, due to the fact that these parties have not yet submitted their lists and the government has declared that the quotas will be reserved, the remaining 1,640 have been produced in accordance with the law. In addition to those who have already registered with the assembly, there are still some representatives en route who will arrive soon. According to the National Assembly Organization Law, the meeting can be convened with the attendance of more than half of the representatives. It is expected that the talents of the assembled talents will be exhausted to ensure the smooth completion of the solemn and great work of drafting the constitution.

### Taiwan Province Actively Investigating Public Land; Implementing Land Redistribution; Allocating Land to Farmers for Cultivation Starting Next Year

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 12th] Taiwan Province is currently actively investigating publicly owned land in order to implement a province-wide redistribution of agricultural land starting next year. In the past, most of the land in Taiwan was concentrated in the hands of the Japanese, leaving Taiwanese without land to cultivate, creating a severe land problem. According to the Taiwan Provincial Government's plan, the majority of the land currently managed by the government will be universally allocated to farmers for cultivation starting next year, based on the agricultural population. For paddy fields, each farm household is expected to receive two "jia" (each jia equals 14.5 mu), while for dry land, each farm household is expected to receive four "jia." For farms exceeding 20 "jia," cooperative farms will be established to collectively engage in production and consumption. This land distribution policy will be the first of its kind in the country's provinces.

### Progress in Sino-French Negotiations; Agreement in Principle on All Issues Expected by the End of the Month; China to Send Delegation to Vietnam for Further Negotiations

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The Sino-French negotiations on the implementation of the Vietnam Agreement are proceeding harmoniously. The valuation of the Yunnan section of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and the restoration of the Vietnamese section are being discussed with progress by Cai Yuan, Chief Secretary of the Directorate General of Highways, and Mr. Mo, the head of the French delegation. The establishment of customs at Haiphong and the demarcation of dedicated docks are being discussed by Zhu Jin, Deputy Director of the Customs Administration, and Fang Du, Tax Commissioner of the Customs and Excise Department. A principle agreement may be reached in Nanjing, and a concrete solution will be sought after an on-site inspection in Haiphong. As for the settlement of military expenses for the Chinese troops stationed in Vietnam, Yan Zisu, representative of the National Treasury, and Gai Qixiu, representative of the Joint Logistics Headquarters, are jointly participating in the negotiations. However, due to the significant difference between the current situation and that when the Sino-French Agreement on Vietnam was signed in February of this year, there is still some distance to go. Both parties have now decided to reach an agreement in principle on all issues by the end of this month, after which the negotiations in Nanjing will end. A Chinese delegation of approximately ten experts and representatives from relevant ministries and commissions will then accompany the French economic delegation to Haiphong to make final decisions on technical matters. The formation of the delegation has been approved by the Executive Yuan, and Ling Qihan has been internally designated as the head of the delegation.

### Amidst Tension

— Ping Su, Reporter for This Newspaper

Nanjing has been crowded with dignitaries these past few days. There's a shortage of hotels, a shortage of cars; besides, there's a lot of mud, a lot of uniforms, a lot of badges – and a lot of news reporters.

But what's most abundant are all kinds of rumors, all kinds of gossip. The political situation changes every moment, and no one dares to say for sure what will happen in the end.

November 11th, the day before the National Assembly was originally scheduled to open, was the day that "changed" the most dramatically. Some said the negotiators had requested a postponement to December 1st, while others said there would be no postponement, and even the representative who would deliver the reply speech at the opening ceremony on the 12th had already been decided – some said it was Hu Shi, others said it was Bishop Yu Zheng. By 4:00 PM, when Hong Lanyou hosted the representatives at the assembly hall, the result of the informal exchange of opinions among the eight or nine hundred representatives present was the selection of Kong Geng to deliver the reply speech – the meeting was still going to be held. The Preparatory Office of the National Assembly issued a notice that the official opening would be at 11:00 AM on the morning of November 12th. Premier Sun announced in the Legislative Yuan that the opening ceremony would be held on the morning of the 12th; but Premier Sun added that the government would make another important announcement at midnight on the 11th.

The likely conclusion seemed to be that the opening ceremony on the 12th would definitely be held, but it was not certain that the official proceedings would begin immediately after the opening ceremony, because the procedures for the meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 11th had changed slightly: Mr. Wang Liangchou walked gracefully up the staircase of the Legislative Yuan at 4:00 PM, but he did not present the originally scheduled report – the deadline for the Legislative Yuan to review the draft amendments to the Constitution had been extended.

The National Assembly Hall had been completely decorated, and the brand-new small national flags fluttered in the evening breeze. The military police from the guard department carefully inspected the soil around the roots of the trees in the courtyard of the hall to see if any bombs were hidden there. The representatives rushed from all over the country, busy completing their registration procedures. As it gradually got darker, the zero hour of the political situation approached.

The negotiators were running around. The news reporters' jeeps were closely following. The phone rang more and more often. What about the more than one thousand three hundred National Assembly representatives? – One said he felt a little depressed; another said he felt "a sense of bewilderment"; many were planning small group activities after the opening ceremony.

The Chinese Communist Party still seemed very determined. The Democratic League said they would submit a letter offering new solutions. Meetings, arguments; then rushing to another place, more meetings, more arguments.

It got dark. What was going to happen? Everyone was still bewildered.

Suddenly, with only two hours left before November 12th, the tense bowstring was loosened.

In the reception center, the doors of the representatives' rooms suddenly opened, and the staff of the reception center said three short sentences: "The assembly is postponed to the 15th. The mausoleum visit tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM will still be held as originally scheduled. If it rains, the mausoleum visit will be canceled."

The negotiators were still running around, the representatives were waiting, the news reporters were waiting. The 450 million people of the entire Republic of China were enduring and waiting.

Editorial

### Expectations for These Three Days

The government, expanding the acceptance of the opinions of those being transferred and the requests of social elites, has once again postponed the National Assembly, originally scheduled to open on November 12th, by three days, to officially open on the 15th. The National Assembly representatives in Nanjing, although inevitably disappointed that the National Assembly could not open as scheduled, yesterday all representatives participated in the memorial ceremony held by the central government at the Mausoleum of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and faced with the visage of the Father of the Nation, who could not be filled with myriad emotions when considering the current domestic situation? Under the leadership of Chairman [Chiang Kai-shek], the people of the entire country, through the National Revolution and the War of Resistance against Japan, have already completed a portion of the Father of the Nation's teachings; however, China is backward in every aspect. In today's international environment, how can we complete the great cause of nation-building? How can we improve the national economy and the people's livelihood? And how can we get on the right track of constitutionalism? These are all urgent problems that the people of the entire country need to solve.

However, everything in the world has its urgency and priority. People both inside and outside the country believe that the only way out for China's current political situation is to get on the right track of constitutionalism; and the beginning of the constitutional period requires a constitution that meets the needs of the people. The opening of the National Assembly symbolizes the beginning of China's constitutional period; therefore, everyone in the country hopes that representatives from all parties, factions, and those without affiliation can gather together on the birthday of the Father of the Nation to deliberate on the fundamental law of the country. However, because the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has always been unable to abandon its partisan biases and interests, it still spares no effort to obstruct the convening of the National Assembly, which not only disappoints the National Assembly representatives in Nanjing but also makes us regret the future of the CCP. Fortunately, the government, adhering to its original intention of peacefully resolving domestic disputes, has shown forbearance everywhere. It has reached the point where it can no longer tolerate or concede any further. There is absolutely no room for considering postponing the National Assembly again; however, at the last moment, the plenary session still maintained the spirit of forbearance and made a final concession by postponing the National Assembly by three days. The day before yesterday at midnight, we received the news of the postponement of the National Assembly, which rekindled a glimmer of hope for the CCP's sudden awakening. The CCP is also descended from the Yellow Emperor. Seeing Chairman Chiang's repeated acts of concession and the people's urgent desire for constitutionalism, how can they remain unmoved? Can partisan concepts really obscure all conscience? We refuse to believe that the CCP is like this. Therefore, in the three days of the National Assembly's postponement, we still hold great expectations for the government, the CCP, and the third parties.

First, although the postponement of the National Assembly by three days is short, it is a turning point and also the CCP's last chance; the CCP should reflect on itself, appeal to its conscience, think it over again, and not miss this last opportunity. It must be understood that the national affairs disputes after the victory of the War of Resistance have not been resolved for a long time, entirely due to the stalemate between the Kuomintang (KMT) and the CCP. Looking back at the negotiation process over the past year, in the eyes of us ordinary people, it is vivid and very clear. We only see the government making concession after concession, even making concessions beyond the limit when it can no longer concede. We ordinary people can fully understand the government's good intentions and express our deep sympathy; however, in the negotiation process over the past year, the CCP has not only made no concessions but has also shown an attitude of taking an inch and wanting a mile. The CCP's view of party factions almost surpasses the nation-state, which has long been abandoned by us ordinary people; however, for the sake of the country's future, what is urgently needed at this moment is peace, democracy, and unity, not war, autocracy, and division. Therefore, in desperation, we can only pray for the CCP's sudden awakening. Hope has always been tenuous, but we have not yet despaired. Today, the CCP must also make some concessions! Otherwise, repeatedly obstructing the convening of the National Assembly will not only violate the public opinion of the people but will also become an obstacle on the road to nation-building. How will the CCP position itself? It should think it over carefully.

Second, third-party figures, including the Democratic League, the Youth Party, and social elites, have been running around calling for action in the past month between the KMT and the CCP, trying to break the current deadlock in the peace talks, and have already made some efforts. However, in these three days of the National Assembly's postponement, especially at the last moment, they should make a final effort. From a higher perspective, we certainly hope that the third party's final efforts can break the current deadlock between the KMT and the CCP, so that the National Assembly can open on the 15th without further postponement, and CCP representatives can also walk into the venue amidst the enthusiastic applause of all representatives. Even if we lower our sights, we hope that at least third-party representatives will attend when the National Assembly opens. We do not need to make overly high demands; we only ask the third-party figures to calmly and quietly appeal to their conscience on this issue and ask whether obstructing the convening of the National Assembly is the public opinion of the people of the entire country. The gentlemen of the Democratic League have always claimed to be representatives of the people. Now that the people of the entire country want peace, unity, and the implementation of constitutionalism, how can they not follow public opinion and instead run around with others? Therefore, we hope that in addition to making a final effort in these three days, third-party figures must disregard the CCP's attitude and independently decide to participate in the National Assembly, which is postponed to open on the 15th. The time is pressing, and there is no room for hesitation and consideration.

Third, although the government's making concessions beyond the limit inevitably disappoints the people, the government's good intentions will surely gain the people's understanding and sympathy. However, we still hope that the government can find a proper solution in these three days to ensure that representatives from all parties and social elites can participate in the National Assembly. At this critical juncture, it is especially important to have a long-term vision, focus on the big picture, not argue over trivial matters, and fully demonstrate the spirit of "doing everything in our power" to break the current deadlock.

In short, the National Assembly has been postponed by three days, and one day has already passed. Only forty-eight hours remain. The situation has developed to this point, and it can be said that it has reached its peak. We hope that everyone in the country, regardless of party affiliation, will seize the opportunity to ensure that the democratic National Assembly, which symbolizes China's peace and unity, can open on the 15th.

### On the Results of the French Elections

The results of the recent general elections in the United States and France are worthy of our attention in today's international politics. The first is that the United States held a midterm election for the House of Representatives and the Senate on the 5th of this month. The result was that the Republican Party, which had been in opposition for fourteen years, won and even overwhelmed the Democratic Party in both houses, gaining an advantage. The second is that France held a general election on the 10th of this month to elect members of the first National Assembly of the Fourth Republic. The result was that the Communist Party jumped to first place. If we say that the victory of the Republican Party in the United States is a sign that the American people are turning to the right, then the Communist Party's rise to prominence in France can also be said to be a prelude to the French people turning to the left.

According to news from Agence France-Presse in Paris on the 11th, the Communist Party received 5,351,000 votes, and the Popular Republican Movement received 4,988,000 votes, a difference of only 363,000 votes. Therefore, in the National Assembly, the Communist Party will have 164 seats, and the Popular Republican Movement will have 160 seats, a difference of only four seats. In addition, the most unexpected thing is that the de Gaulle Union only received 585,000 votes and will only have nine seats in the new National Assembly. De Gaulle had previously issued fierce criticisms of the new constitution, and he was also very active before the election. His political stance is relatively conservative. Domestically, he advocates increasing the administrative power of the president. Internationally, he advocates Anglo-French cooperation to create a Western bloc to resist foreign forces dominating the world. He is similar to former British Prime Minister Churchill. Both of them are national heroes, and the people of the entire country respect them very much, but their political ideas have not kept up with the times, and the people of Britain and France can no longer follow them.

The most important thing in the world after World War II is the economic recovery of various countries. After a long period of destruction by war, the people of various countries yearn for a stable life. National pride and political freedom are ultimately no match for empty stomachs. Therefore, imperialism and democratic politics will never completely replace the trend of economic improvement. Now, any government in the world that cannot improve the national economy of its own country will inevitably collapse. The British Labour Party is supported by the British people because it can nationalize important enterprises and not allow a few capitalists to monopolize them. The victory of the American Republican Party is because the Democratic Party's planned economy caused social unrest. The initial success of the Bidault government in France was also due to the fact that he disregarded everything and agreed to increase workers' wages by 25%.

The results of this French election show that although the French people are not completely disappointed with the Bidault government, they want to make further demands, so they turned to support the Communist Party. However, although the Communist Party received the most votes, the difference with the Popular Republican Movement is ultimately limited. The two parties must cooperate, and cooperate with other parties, in order to implement their own policies. In the future, the policies of the French government will definitely not be the policies of one party, but the harmonization of the policies of various parties. However, since the Communist Party has a majority, they also have the power to dominate government policies.

From the perspective of international politics, if we say that the victory of the Communist Party in this French election symbolizes the intrusion of Soviet political power into Western Europe, then that is somewhat paranoid. The French government has always maintained friendly relations with the Soviet Union. Even if the Communist Party does not win, the French government has no intention of being anti-Soviet. The French nation is the most freedom-loving nation in the world, and the French government is a truly democratic government. If a government has any autocratic tendencies, the French people will immediately rise up to overthrow it. The issue that the French people are most concerned about today is not international fronts, but the improvement of the national economy of France. The French people do not need to be an appendage of any world power. They only hope to be a peaceful, prosperous, independent, and free country. If the French Communist Party wants to build the French government into a state like Yugoslavia, they will encounter a tragic failure. Moreover, in this election, the number of votes for the Communist Party and the Popular Republican Movement is limited, and there are nearly five million voters who did not vote in this election.

We should express deep sympathy for this expression of French public opinion. They have deeply recognized that the center of the current world issue is the economic recovery of various countries. The people of all countries in the world urgently need a stable life. In order to obtain a stable life, we must pay full attention to governments that improve people's lives. The struggle of international blocs, the revival of imperialism, and empty talk of democracy cannot arouse the interest of the people who urgently need to improve their lives. The new French government in the future, and any government in the future, must solve this central issue. Only when this central issue is resolved can the world have peace and happiness, and the governments of all countries can be considered truly supported by the people.

### Anqiu Suffers Communist Catastrophe Blood Splatters Across the City and Hundreds of Students Captured Fellow Villagers in Jinan Urgently Call for Post-Disaster Relief

[Report from Jinan by this newspaper] The county seat of Anqiu was attacked by the Communist "New Fourth Army" on the 4th of this month. The defending troops fought bravely, but eventually ran out of ammunition and supplies. The city fell on the evening of the 5th. Li Xianqi, captain of the Zhucheng Security Team, was killed in action. Rong Guangzhi, the head of the First Division's Supplementary Regiment, was injured. Ju Guansan, the head of the Self-Defense Regiment, committed suicide and could not be saved. Li Zhimin, the Speaker of the County Council, and Yu Xian, the Secretary-General of the County Party Headquarters, also died in the line of duty. Gao Jiren, the Deputy Speaker of the County Provisional Council, and Zhao Guansheng, a member of the County Council, along with ten others, were captured. Wang Jingyu, the Secretary of the County Council, died in battle. Li Demei, the Principal of the Provincial Anqiu Middle School, was captured, and more than 400 students were captured. Ma Huichuan and Ma Juefang, the Section Chiefs of the County Government, were killed in action. The whereabouts of the County Magistrate, Pan Jiemin, are unknown. More than 2,000 members of the Security Brigade, the County Self-Defense Regiment, and the Police Brigade were mostly killed or wounded. A large number of civilians died, but the exact number has not yet been tallied, and countless houses were damaged. This loss is an unprecedented catastrophe for the county. Because the County Council happened to be holding its inaugural meeting, and there was also an opera performance for birthday celebrations and school donations, the township and town chiefs from the rural areas all came to the city to participate, and all the party, government, military, and civilian cadres of the county were gathered in the city, so they were all caught in one fell swoop by the Communist army. After the incident, in the aftermath, the Section Chiefs of the County Government were either dead or captured, and only four staff members remained. Of the more than 1,000 students at the Provincial Anqiu Middle School, only a little over 200 remain after the rescue. The situation is so tragic that it is unprecedented among the counties of Shandong since the War of Resistance. It was not until the morning of the 7th that the National Army and Commissioner Zhang Tianzu led troops to recover the city. The Anqiu Fellow Villagers Association in Jinan held an emergency meeting on the 9th and resolved to appeal to the military and political authorities to handle the post-disaster relief.

A reporter from this newspaper specially went to visit on the eve of the meeting to inquire about the focus of the review meeting, as well as the review and prospects of Jiangsu's finances. Director Dong gave the following remarks: Since the restoration of the three-level financial system in July, the financial resources of counties and cities have been more abundant than before the war. If there is still a situation where revenue and expenditure are insufficient in the future, it must not be due to a poor system, but to poor management. In order to avoid this personnel defect and to make the finances of various counties and cities sound, this province has decided to convene review meetings by district. The first and fifth districts have already been held in Zhenjiang on the 9th. The focus is on five points: (1) Hearing reports on the financial business of various counties. (2) Reviewing whether the various financial laws and regulations promulgated by the province are suitable for the actual situation of various counties. (3) Discussing the plan to strengthen financial and taxation work in the future. (4) The major aspects of financial revenue and expenditure of various counties and cities in the future. (5) Financial supervisors of various counties and cities exchange opinions and seek coordination in administrative aspects.

Review and Prospects

As for the review and prospects of Jiangsu's finances, generally speaking, in the past, counties and cities that were exempt from land tax relied entirely on limited allocations from the central government. Even with the addition of autonomous donations and various special taxes tailored to local conditions, the total revenue could not offset the land tax that was exempted. Therefore, in the past year, the finances of various counties and cities were still insufficient to pay the salaries of public educators, and it was difficult to carry out any construction, which is regrettable. Now, since the financial system was reformed on July 1, the deed tax and business tax have been allocated to the local governments, and the land tax will continue to be collected in kind. In the future, the finances of counties and cities can be expected to be prosperous. However, July, August, September, October, and November are still a period of scarcity. Because the transfer of the deed tax and business tax has just begun, it is difficult to expect a strong income. After the land tax is collected in kind, it must be sold to the Grain Department before cash can be obtained. After December, it should be gradually sufficient. Subsequently, the expenditure of the county and city budgets should focus on education and construction. What is also gratifying to the society is that all special taxes tailored to local conditions in various counties and cities have now been uniformly abolished by explicit order and must not be levied again. It is learned that the review meeting is scheduled for two days, and may be extended if necessary.

### Village Head Instigates Robbery Harboring Bandits Exposed and Arrested

[Report from Hefei by this newspaper] The home of Wang Xizhao, who made a living as a fortune teller in the fourth village of Dongwa Town in this city and was a well-to-do family, was broken into by seven or eight bandits on the night of the 5th, and everything was looted, resulting in the loss of hundreds of thousands of legal tender and dozens of pieces of clothing. On the 6th, Wang saw that the robbers were all living in the home of Wang Huaifa, the head of his village, and reported it to the Ninth Squadron of the Dongwa Security Team. Together with the Second Squadron of the Police Security Team, they went to arrest Wang Huaifa, Wang Honghai, Gao Huajun, and other three persons. After interrogation, they confessed that there were still accomplices, Ji Weizhang and Ji Weicheng, who were at large, so they went to the address and arrested Ji Weizhang, Ji Weicheng, Xu Bufa, Qu Linqing, Wang Li's, Wang Lagen, and others. In the afternoon of the 6th, they had been escorted to the Security Headquarters for interrogation. It was reported that Ji Weizhang had served as the captain of a puppet army, and Gao Huajun was the village cadre. This robbery of Wang Xizhao's home was instigated by the village head Wang Huaifa.

### Three Bandits in Changshu Immediately Executed by Firing Squad

[Report from Changshu by this newspaper] When this county launched a suppression campaign last month, it captured three bandits, Zhu Kun, Tao Liansheng, and Zhu Baoqi, in the Meili District. After being sent to the county military law court for trial, Zhu Kun confessed that he was 28 years old, from Tangqiao, Meili, and admitted that he had been a bandit for many years and had strangled Jiang Hongsheng, the head of the first village in Tangqiao Township. Tao Liansheng confessed that he was 19 years old, from Liantang, and had hidden a large number of firearms and plundered civilian property, which was too numerous to count.

### Six Lake Bandits Sentenced to Death

[Report from Suzhou by this newspaper on the 12th] The Taihu Suppression Commander led his troops in an encounter with bandits on Platform Mountain in Taihu Lake on the morning of the 9th. Fifteen bandits were captured alive. Except for nine who were identified as coerced boatmen, the remaining six bandit leaders, including Liu Shenlin, were sentenced by the Wuxi Command Post. Because they independently rebelled and resisted government troops, causing our Discipline Team member Zhao Rengui (also known as Cao Yingguan) to be shot and killed, their crimes are unforgivable. They have now been uniformly sentenced to death to serve as a warning and will be executed on a scheduled date.

During the arrest, stolen goods and other evidence related to the robbery case were also found.

### Jiangyin Cloth Factory Requests Yarn Allocation

[Report from Jiangyin by this newspaper] Chengyi has always been a yarn and cloth production area with a history of several decades. Cloth factories in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Wuxi, Wuchang, and other places all need Jiangyin weavers. Recently, raw material prices have soared, and it is not easy for cloth factories to maintain their operations. Pure weaving factories in Shanghai have access to cotton yarn allocation, but Jiangyin pure weaving factories have no source of yarn for weaving other than seeking the black market, resulting in a huge cost difference. The Cloth Factory Trade Association specially telegraphed the Shanghai Municipal Government on the 10th to forward it to the Textile Industry Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, ordering the Sixth District Cotton Textile Industry Association to allocate yarn to inland factories in accordance with the joint yarn allocation system in order to maintain production.

### Haijian Cracks Down on Gambling Den

[Report from Haijian by this newspaper] Gambling dens in Tongyuan Town have sprung up again, day and night, without any legal constraints. Idlers and loafers all flock to them. In view of the unanimous urging of public opinion, the police station dispatched police officers on the night of October 24 and cracked down on a gambling den in Gu Jiarong's store in the West Market. The owners and big spenders were fined. As a result, the various "colleagues" have been more cautious in recent days and have all temporarily announced a "shutdown."

### New Recruits in Hao County Enlist The Public and Their Families Line the Streets to Cheer Them On

[Report from Hao County by this newspaper] This county was ordered to begin the first phase of conscription of 1,700 soldiers at the beginning of last month.

The entire county's public and their families lined the streets to cheer them on. The strong and healthy men showed even more spirit, and their faces were full of heroism. Amidst the sounds of music and firecrackers, they drove through the familiar streets of their hometown, stepping onto the glorious path of fulfilling their military service and increasing national defense.

### Traitorous Special Agent Wu Shiquan Dies in Prison in Bengbu

[Report from Bengbu by this newspaper] Wu Binquan, a well-known traitor who worked as a special agent for the enemy during the occupation of Bengbu, hid in the home of Guo Dianxing, a Henan native in this port, after the victory because he feared punishment. The Anti-Traitor Office detected this and arrested both criminals. They were transferred to the Procuratorate of the First Branch of the Higher Court here for investigation and then handed over to the criminal court for trial. Wu died in prison, and Guo Dianxing was sentenced to one year in prison for harboring a traitor on the 9th.

[Report from Chongming by this newspaper] Most of the bridges on the Lianzhi Highway in this county are built with wood. After seven years of occupation by the enemy, they were severely damaged.

### Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce Disputes Number of Council Seats

[Report from Wuxi by this newspaper] Regarding the number of county council seats, the labor union side advocates using the number of members as the standard.

Farmers' Suffering is No Small Matter

The economic downturn of industry and commerce is frequently reported, demonstrating that various sectors highly value this problem. Domestic manufacturers are being overwhelmed by foreign goods, yet the majority still genuinely prefer domestic products, especially farmers. They prioritize durability and practicality over aesthetics in all their supplies. In rural homes, foreign goods are rarely seen, indicating this preference. However, the concern is the vast disparity between the value of agricultural products and urban processed goods, leading to low grain prices harming farmers and rural bankruptcy! Their annual income is insufficient to cover debts due to the high cost of artificial fertilizers and taxes. Other demands are out of the question, and purchasing power is weak, causing the decline of rural commerce, ultimately leading to the downfall of urban stores. A rural resident told us that farmers are suffering greatly, and no one speaks for us fairly! For example, now that rice has just been harvested, its price is so low it cannot cover the debts incurred for its production! To maintain credit during the harvest season, farmers have no choice but to sell cheaply to repay debts, leaving nothing for future livelihood or next year's farming! Other fundamental needs are not even discussed or considered! Also, wheat is currently expensive, but farmers have long since sold their wheat! In conclusion, if the economic crisis is not resolved by saving the rural areas, everyone will perish together! (Zhu Peide, Qingpu)

The area along the Republic Road used to be the border between the old Chinese and French concessions. During the Shanghai battle, the National Army built fortresses at the Xinkai River and Xiaodongmen to defend against the enemy. However, more than a year after the victory, these two fortresses still stand. Ignorant people often urinate and defecate inside, causing foul odors to spread during the summer, which is detrimental to hygiene and harms the city's appearance. It is hoped that relevant authorities will promptly dismantle these two fortresses to improve hygiene and enhance the city's visual appeal. (Guan Youshan)

Since Xinzhuang was incorporated into the Shanghai Municipality, contact between its administration, personnel, and the city center has become increasingly frequent. However, travel is inconvenient and time-consuming because transportation has not yet recovered to its pre-war state. Although the railway authorities adjusted the train schedules on National Day this year, and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway even added two trains on the Anting-Jiading-Jiading-Shanghai route, these trains are express trains that do not stop at small stations. Therefore, the majority of ordinary citizens have not benefited from this change. In particular, merchants and travelers at Xinzhuang Station frequently witness these Jiading-Shanghai trains being delayed and stopping at the station to wait for the West Lake sightseeing train to exchange passengers, sometimes for over ten minutes. The train cars have plenty of space, but because it is not a formally scheduled stop, no tickets are sold, making it seem within reach but unattainable! Although local businesses and party organizations have repeatedly submitted requests, they have not been approved even after a month. The railway authorities may have operational difficulties, but for the sake of benefiting the majority of ordinary citizens and reducing the danger of overcrowded 42-seat passenger cars (passengers climbing in and out of windows or onto the roof is commonplace), it is necessary to make efforts to overcome these difficulties. The railway authorities should consider, without affecting the train schedule (such as the example of stopping due to delays to wait for exchanges), allowing these trains to regularly stop at Xinzhuang Station for one minute to sell tickets, in line with the principle of state-run transportation serving the public. If so, travelers from Sijing, Zhuanqiao, and other places would also benefit, not just Xinzhuang. (Yi Fan)

### Gu Weijun Reminds European and American Politicians: Asia's Position Cannot Be Ignored, The Soviet Union Can Easily Coordinate with the US on Disarmament

[United Press, New York, December 12] The foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union delivered speeches expressing their views at a banquet of the Foreign Press Association last night. Chinese Ambassador to the United States Gu Weijun also attended and stated: "Wise statesmen will recognize the significant role Asia is playing today and continue to strive for world peace and happiness." He added that there are many significant signs of Asia's awakening, which no thoughtful politician can afford to ignore. He said that the rise of the Philippine Republic, the imminent independence of India, and the demands for autonomy from Indonesia and Vietnam all demonstrate the significant role Asia is about to play in world affairs. He also said: "To achieve the lofty goals of the United Nations, the need for organization and cooperation in the East is equal to that in the West. Through this closer cooperation, the ideal of a human parliament and a world federation will surely be realized one day."

[Agence France-Presse, New York, December 12] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov stated at a banquet of the Foreign Press Association last night that people all over the world truly desire peace. Considering the efforts made during the war, they should enjoy peace. Universal disarmament is an urgent task. The Soviet Union has proposed this to the United Nations, and the United States has a similar plan. The Soviet delegation intends to reach an agreement with the U.S. delegation to harmonize the two proposals. He believes this issue can be resolved at this session of the General Assembly. If the assembly can agree on a perfect plan, it can end the arms race that has already begun, reduce the military burden on the people of various countries, and raise their living standards. There is nothing better than this. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes stated that the American people elected a new Congress but do not want to change foreign policy. Our foreign policy is neither Democratic nor Republican, but for all Americans. It would be a big mistake for other governments to believe that this election indicates that the American people want to change their foreign policy.

British Foreign Secretary Bevin then spoke, briefly stating that speaking of peace is not enough; it is necessary to make great efforts to ensure peace, and international constraints must be respected to be effective. Regarding disarmament, Britain took the lead after World War I, but Britain's unilateral actions almost led to disaster. Today, some accuse Britain of wanting to use atomic energy to manufacture destructive weapons, which is absolutely not true. Our country only hopes to restore its own industrial prosperity.

[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco, December 12 (Broadcast): Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov stated last night that the Soviet Union is prepared to make concessions in order to reach a compromise with the United States on global disarmament, thereby ensuring lasting world peace. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes did not comment on Molotov's conciliatory attitude, but emphasized that the results of the U.S. elections last week do not affect U.S. foreign policy.

### The United States Plans to Draft a Military Reduction Plan to Be Submitted to the United Nations General Assembly for Discussion

[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco, December 12 (Broadcast): The U.S. draft plan for military reduction will be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly within days and is currently being carefully considered by Byrnes, Austin, and others. The U.S. draft military reduction plan differs from the Soviet plan. The Soviet Union aims to implement control through international treaties, while the United States will appoint an international control agency to monitor whether there are any violations of military reduction before implementing military reduction.

[United Press, Lake Success, December 12] The U.S. world disarmament plan, which includes banning the private manufacture of weapons, is nearing completion and will be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly within days. It is expected that this U.S. proposal will be handed over to the United Nations Military Staff Committee, which is composed of the five major powers and is responsible for the United Nations international police force.

Soviet Representative Criticizes Britain, the United States, and South Africa in the Trusteeship Council

[Associated Press, Lake Success, November 11] Soviet representative Novikov criticized Britain today in a speech to the Trusteeship Council for failing to transfer Palestine to United Nations trusteeship. He also considered the U.S. proposal for trusteeship over the former Japanese-mandated islands in the Pacific to be inconsistent with the trusteeship system. Novikov's speech lasted for an hour, and representatives from Britain, the United States, and South Africa immediately spoke in rebuttal. The U.S. representative directly accused the Soviet Union of consistently obstructing the formation of the Trusteeship Council.

Regarding the Palestine issue, Novikov said in his speech that the fate of the area is still unresolved. Britain has not submitted a draft for trusteeship of the area, and the Soviet Union wants to know why. The Soviet Union is well aware that Britain cannot justify this. It is now clear that the British government is negotiating to resolve this issue outside the United Nations framework, on the one hand with the United States and on the other hand separately with the Arabs and Jews. This behavior violates the United Nations Charter. Novikov then said that the U.S. proposal for trusteeship over the former Japanese-mandated islands in the Pacific is self-contradictory. The proposed trusteeship is merely an "expression of intention." The Trusteeship Council should be established during this session of the General Assembly. Novikov's speech mainly attacked Britain, Australia, and South Africa, saying that countries that had been mandated by the League of Nations should be held responsible for the failure to establish the Trusteeship Council. Novikov continued that the South African Union's attempt to merge the mandated territory of Southwest Africa directly violates the articles and principles of the United Nations Charter. The Soviet Union will oppose the request for merger and will insist that South Africa submit a draft for trusteeship of Southwest Africa.

### The Four Foreign Ministers Continue Their Meeting to Review the Peace Treaties of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland, The United States Agrees to Return Seized Ships to Their Original Owners

[Central News Agency, New York, December 12] The four foreign ministers conducted a preliminary review of the peace treaties of Bulgaria and Hungary yesterday morning. During the review of the Bulgarian treaty, there was a new development: Britain suggested that the Bulgarian-Greek border should be revised in the interest of Greece. Britain's proposal would strengthen Greece's position in Thessaloniki. Bevin suggested that this issue be submitted to the foreign ministers' representatives for study, which was agreed to by the U.S. and French representatives, but opposed by Molotov.

[Agence France-Presse, New York, December 12] The four foreign ministers continued their meeting last night, chaired by French representative Merville, primarily discussing the issue of Hungarian reparations. Byrnes declared that the United States intends to return all Hungarian ships currently occupied by the United States to their original owners. British Foreign Secretary Bevin then raised the issue of the future withdrawal of Allied forces from Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria. Finally, they discussed the Finnish peace treaty and agreed that the Finnish government should pay 300 million U.S. dollars in reparations to the Soviet Union. In several meetings last week, the four foreign ministers reviewed a total of 65 resolutions passed at the Paris Peace Conference, of which six were adopted, five were returned to the foreign ministers' representatives for further study, and one was withdrawn.

[Central News Agency, Washington, D.C., November 11] At today's commemoration of the 26th anniversary of the end of World War I, U.S. government officials emphasized the need to prepare to defend peace and maintain a strong military to defend peace. President Truman delivered a speech at a solemn ceremony near the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington National Cemetery, stating that the welfare of the United States and the world is inseparable from peace, and that current negotiations are aimed at this goal and preventing a third world war. Secretary of the Navy Forrestal called on the American people to create "institutions, laws, and practical implementation methods to make the popular desire for peace a true reality."

### The Soviet Union Has 2 Million Troops Stationed Abroad, Far More Than the Combined Number of British and American Troops

[Associated Press, , November 11] Lunt, a U.S. wartime intelligence officer, published an article in the November issue of "The New Leader" stating that the Soviet Union still has more than 3 million active troops, of whom 2 million are stationed outside the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has between 445,000 and 480,000 troops stationed in "non-enemy" countries. The Soviet Union is demanding that the number of Allied troops stationed in various countries be investigated by the United Nations. Britain has 195,000 troops stationed in these countries, and the United States has 132,000 troops. Soviet troops stationed abroad are concentrated in Poland.

As for Yugoslavia and Albania, only 10,000 troops are stationed there, and between 5,000 and 10,000 Soviet troops are stationed in Czechoslovakia. There are still 10,000 Soviet troops in Iranian Azerbaijan province. It is feared that there are no longer Soviet troops in China.

The number of British troops stationed in non-enemy countries is as follows: Greece 50,000, China 5,000, Egypt 100,000, East India 25,000, Iraq and Transjordan 15,000. The United States has no troops in non-enemy countries in Europe, but the number of troops stationed in other non-enemy countries is as follows: Iceland and Greenland 2,000, Panama 50,000, the Philippines 50,000, China 30,000.

The number of Soviet troops stationed in former enemy countries is even far greater than the combined number of British and American troops, with 1,535,000 for the Soviet Union and 520,000 for Britain and the United States. The Soviet Union has 725,000 troops stationed in Germany, while Britain has only 350,000 and the United States has only 290,000. Austria has 65,000 Soviet troops, 28,000 British troops, and 15,000 American troops. There are no Soviet troops in Italy, but there are 45,000 British troops and 25,000 American troops. There are no British or American troops in Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Finland, but there are 470,000 Soviet troops.

The Soviet Union has no occupying forces in Japan, while Britain has 40,000 and the United States has 140,000. There are 275,000 Soviet troops in Korea and 50,000 American troops. The British have 10,000 troops in Italian Africa, while the Soviet Union and the United States have no troops.

Lunt concluded that it is surprising that the Soviet Union, while maintaining such a disproportionate force, while Britain and the United States have already demobilized on a large scale, still demands an investigation into its troops stationed abroad.

At the Request of the Republican Party, the United States Will Reduce Military Spending

### Eisenhower Resignation Rumor, Truman Denies

[Central News Agency, Washington, D.C., November 11 (United Press)] President Truman denied rumors that Army Chief of Staff Dwight D. Eisenhower wanted to resign due to disagreements with the White House over Army funding.

[Associated Press, London, December 12] British King George VI and Prime Minister Attlee attended the opening ceremony of the second session of Parliament after the Labor Party came to power today, which was heavily guarded by thousands of police officers to prevent assassination by extremists among the Jews. Government spokesmen did not fully believe reports of underground groups planning terrorist attacks in Britain, but authorities have taken extraordinary measures.

### Commemorating the Birthday of the Founding Father; Various Sectors Hold Grand Meeting; The Grand Theatre Venue Decorated Solemnly and Respectfully; Mayor Wu Elaborates on the Significance of the Premier's Will

[Our Own Dispatch] Yesterday was the birthday of the Founding Father. At 9:00 AM, various sectors of the city held a commemorative meeting at the Grand Theatre, also celebrating the convening of the National Assembly. Those in attendance included Wu Guozhen, Xie Renzhao, Xu Ji, Gu Chunfan, Shui Xiangyun, Li Ximou, Li Jianhua, Feng Youzhen, Wang Zhuyi, and over a thousand representatives from various agencies, organizations, and schools. The venue was decorated solemnly and respectfully, with a portrait of the Founding Father and the national flag of the Kuomintang in the center, surrounded by flowers and electric lights. The walls were adorned with slogans such as "National Unification, World Peace," "Return Governance to the People, Return Military Power to the Nation," "Implement Democratic Constitutionalism, Complete the National Revolution," "Respectfully Follow the Teachings of the Founding Father, Convene the National Assembly," "Celebrate the Birthday of the Founding Father, Realize Democratic Politics," and "Celebrate the Opening of the National Assembly, Lay the Foundation for Constitutionalism."

After the ritual proceedings, Chairman Mayor Wu delivered a speech, stating that in commemorating the birthday of the Founding Father today, we recall that the goal of the revolution, as instructed in the Founding Father's will, is to seek freedom and equality for China. In the past, our country suffered from the bullying of Japanese imperialism and the constraints of unequal treaties externally, and from the separatist suppression of warlords internally. Therefore, the last two sentences of the Founding Father's will are to abolish unequal treaties and convene a national conference. The unequal treaties have already been abolished after eight years of resistance. The current convening of the National Assembly is to return governance to the people, end the period of political tutelage, and advance to the constitutional era, so that the people can obtain freedom and equality. Therefore, those who oppose the National Assembly are the great enemies of democracy. We have now heard that the National Assembly has been postponed for another three days, and we earnestly hope that it can be convened as scheduled after these three days to realize the Founding Father's teachings and achieve true freedom and equality.

Xie Renzhao Delivers a Speech

Following this, the Secretary of the City Party Committee, Xie Renzhao, delivered a speech, stating that the Founding Father's lifelong goal of revolution was to seek equality and freedom, to abolish unequal treaties externally, and to convene a National Assembly internally. The former has been accomplished after eight years of bitter struggle, which can be reported with consolation, but the latter has been postponed again despite this convening, because the government is upholding the Founding Father's legacy of peace and struggle to save China, enduring and seeking peace and unity for the sake of the country. The purpose of the National Assembly is to begin constitutionalism and return governance to the people, as the only legitimate organ representing the people of the entire country. The people are the masters of the country, and no party should interfere in politics with military force. Instead, parliamentary representation should replace the battlefield, turning swords into plowshares. Our country's eight years of resistance were for the sake of implementing constitutionalism, and it is hoped that the people of the entire country will unanimously support it to prevent it from failing. He further stated that the Three Principles of the People are not only the doctrine for saving China, but also the doctrine for saving the world, and only the Three Principles of the People can socialize socialism and democratize capitalism, making it suitable for the global trend and meeting the needs of the people. The realization of the Three Principles of the People can avoid the occurrence of a third world war. Today, in commemorating the birthday of the Founding Father, the people of the entire country should strive to realize the Founding Father's teachings and enable all mankind to achieve the ideals of freedom and happiness.

After Xie's speech, Xuan Wu and Xu Ji also delivered speeches one after another, elaborating on the Founding Father's teachings and the significance of convening the National Assembly. Finally, Mayor Wu read a telegram to the National Assembly, which was unanimously approved by the entire assembly with applause, and the meeting adjourned after chanting slogans.

Telegram Congratulating the National Assembly

The text of the telegram to the National Assembly is as follows: "Urgent, Nanjing National Assembly, As we celebrate the 81st birthday of the Founding Father, your Assembly is about to open in Nanjing.

We respectfully follow the Chairman's instructions and jointly establish the great cause of rejuvenation. We look up to you from afar with admiration. We send this telegram to express our sincere wishes. Shanghai Municipal All Circles Commemorating the Founding Father's Birthday Assembly (text) Koutou."

Finally, the presidium led the entire assembly in shouting the slogans of the meeting: 1. Celebrate the birthday of the Founding Father. 2. Support the National Assembly. 3. Implement the Founding Father's teachings. 4. Complete democratic constitutionalism. 5. Consolidate peaceful unification. 6. Expand winter relief. 7. Return governance to the people and return military power to the nation. 8. Long live the Three Principles of the People. 9. Long live the Republic of China.

### Two Railways Prevent Black Market Tickets; Change Time for Issuance of Assigned Seat Tickets

[Our Own Dispatch] Although the authorities of the Jin-Hu and Hu-Hang railways have repeatedly improved facilities and increased the number of trains, the situation of passenger congestion has not diminished, and "ticket scalpers" are actively engaged in rampant black market ticket sales.

The gasoline trains Xihu and Taihu are limited to sales on the afternoon of the day before. Other slow trains will still begin selling tickets three hours before departure.

Instead, the public was invited to visit various departments from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM. Zhongshan Hospital was built by Dr. Yan Fuqing after raising funds from various sectors. It was completed in 1938, but unfortunately, it was occupied by the enemy before it could be used, causing extensive damage to the internal facilities.

Other facilities, such as the operating rooms and sterilization rooms, are very well-equipped. According to the person in charge of the hospital, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) has shipped a large number of medical supplies from the United States, most of which have been donated to the hospital, such as sterilization machines, surgical tools, mattresses, kettles, and activity chairs. They are of high quality and exquisite design, and they are now being used separately.

### Yongkang Ship Crew Submits Joint Lawsuit

The Yongkang ship flew the Italian flag in 1937 and sailed on China's inland rivers, belonging to the Italian-China Shipping Company. After the outbreak of the war, the ship was docked in Nanjing and Hankou and was requisitioned by US Third Fleet Commander Chenault and converted into an American warship. After the victory, the ship was reclaimed by the Yongxing Shipping Company and sailed between Chongqing and Shanghai. However, the ship has not dismissed its original crew for the past nine years. The accumulated salary has not been paid to this day, causing the entire crew of the ship to be unable to work for other shipping companies, which has created a significant problem in their lives.

It is reported that the Marine Engineers Union has filed a complaint with the competent authorities and is investigating the ship's ownership.

### Promoting Education and Culture, Developing Construction Undertakings; Proposal to Exempt 16mm Films from Import Taxes

Li, chairman of the Import Design Special Committee of the Supreme Economic Council, recently convened a meeting on the fifth floor of No. 24 Wai Tan Road in this city to discuss the issue of film imports. Attendees included Yao Zhichu, representative of the Ministry of National Defense, Cao Shufan, representative of the Ministry of Finance, Wu Yaoqi, representative of the Customs Administration, Wang Fushan, professor at Zhejiang University, and Sun Mingjing, director of the Department of Electrical Education at Jinling University. The focus of the discussion was on increasing the import of 16mm films to benefit construction undertakings. According to the postwar development of education and culture in various countries around the world, 16mm films are gradually replacing the reduction of 35mm films to supplement classroom education, factory technical training, military academic guidance, and public cultural inculcation. In the past, imports were restricted by the provisions of Customs Tariff No. 656, which prevented sufficient imports, whether they were 35mm entertainment films or 16mm educational films, as they were all restricted by length. From March to September of this year, 1.3 million meters were approved for import. The batch of 16mm films planned to be transported to China has 247,320 feet, reaching 100,000 feet. According to the current quota set by Customs, it is not easy to import smoothly. The American RKO company is particularly active in the production of various companies. In July of this year, the company specially sent a representative, A.C. Botluner-By, to Nanjing to contact the Ministry of Education and was invited by Vice Minister Hang to participate in the discussion. Based on the above points, the representatives attending the meeting exchanged opinions and reached a unanimous agreement, proposing that 16mm films be regarded as books, teaching specimens, and wall charts, not subject to the current quota restrictions, and requesting that they be included in the provisions of Customs Tariff Article 543 for tax-free import, in order to promote the development of China's education, culture, and construction undertakings. It is also understood that the association has submitted a report to President Zhu of the Executive Yuan for instructions.

In the autumn of the same year, she came to Shanghai again. During these years, she visited various places such as Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, Suzhou, and Hangzhou, using painting and exhibiting as a cover. In reality, she acknowledged the traitor Chu Minyi as her father and befriended enemy naval press chief Matsushima Kei and Shiota as her informants, collecting important information from our side and reporting it to the enemy puppet regime until the victory of the Anti-Japanese War.

### Female Reporter Xue Mei Commits Suicide by Poison; Suicide Note Complains About Han Jingqing; Tragic Background, Economic Pressure

[Our Report] Xue Mei, a woman from Shaoxing, 26 years old, received higher education. Her father worked in the Ministry of Communications for many years. Before she reached adulthood, her father passed away. During the Anti-Japanese War, Xue Mei and the young Bao Dongsheng shared common aspirations and became lovers, going together to the interior, both willing to serve the country. Later, due to differences of opinion, they temporarily separated. Bao Dongsheng continued to serve in the New First Army in the Northeast, while Xue came to Shanghai. Because she had few relatives and friends, she initially rented a room in a small Nanjing hotel. Later, through an introduction, she entered a certain evening newspaper as a field reporter.

Around August, when all sectors of Shanghai were organizing disaster relief for northern Jiangsu, they selected "Miss Shanghai". On the 17th of that month, Xue visited the residence of singer Han Jingqing, the "Queen of Songs," at No. 189 Jiangyin Road, to interview her about her thoughts on participating in the competition. Although it was their first meeting, they felt an immediate connection, as if they had met too late. Xue shared her tragic life story and also told her that although she had a job, her food and accommodation problems had not yet been resolved, and she was still living in small hotel restaurants. Han, seeing that they were both women and that she only had a maid in her residence, immediately invited her to come and live with her. A few days later, Xue moved in with her luggage, and they confided in each other day and night, their friendship growing stronger. Over the months, Han successively provided her with over one million yuan in financial assistance. Before February, Xue was injured in a car accident in front of the New Xianlin Dance Hall and was sent to the Sino-American Hospital for treatment for over a month, with Han also raising 700,000 yuan for medical expenses. Last month, Han's elderly father from Hui'an came to Shanghai to visit. After discussing Xue's life story, he strongly advised Jingqing to relocate, saying that although Xue was a weak woman, he did not know her past history in detail and that rashly inviting her to live together might lead to unexpected events in the future. However, Han felt it was inappropriate to say this to Xue and asked her to move out.

After being ridiculed by Han's father, Xue finally understood and rented a room at No. 317, Xin Huizhong Hotel, Hankou Road. After about half a month, she again consulted with Han due to lack of funds, and Han gave her 300,000 yuan. There had been no contact for ten days. Starting on the 6th, Xue rented a room at No. 317, Great Shanghai Hotel. At the same time, Sun Haoran, a new military officer, also lived at No. 529 of the same hotel. He was a colleague of Bao Dongsheng, so he was very familiar with Xue. Yesterday morning at 11:30 AM, he instructed the tea server Wang Er to check on Xue's room. Unexpectedly, he found an empty bottle of sleeping pills on the table. Xue was unconscious on the bed, indicating that she had taken poison. He also discovered

a suicide note that read: "Jingqing: Goodbye. I hope you will take care of my affairs after my death and not be too cruel. If you use a little less, I don't know if I'll die in anxiety. Thinking of your ruthlessness truly breaks my heart. I hope you will quickly realize. Attached is a pawn ticket. The laundry needs to be returned to you. Signed, Xue Mei, final words on November 12." Later, the hotel reported to the Lao Zha sub-bureau, and section member Zhang Guodong led police officers to investigate. They discovered a pawn ticket for a women's watch, pawned at Shengda Pawnshop at the intersection of Tianjin Road and Shilu, for a sum of 92,000 yuan. It was determined that this watch was also borrowed from Han Jingqing. Xue was transported to the Sino-American Hospital. Due to the excessive amount of poison ingested, she was still in critical condition at midnight.

### Bandits Rob a Taxi; Driver Bound and Thrown Off

[Our Report] A young man came to the Mountain Automobile Company at No. 1080, Zhongzheng East Road, at around 9:00 PM last night and chartered a car with the license plate 20774. The driver He Zhifang drove to near the New City God Temple on Luzon Road, where three more people jumped into the car. They drove to the Bund and headed north, driving straight to a remote area on Huacheng Road. The four people in the car then brandished pistols, threatening He and using rope to tie his hands behind his back. They also stuffed paper into his mouth. One of them drove the car north to Xibao Road, threw the driver He Zhifang out of the car, and sped away, disappearing without a trace.

While his car was passing North Sichuan Road, a military truck suddenly sped up from behind and cut in front, crashing into Mayor Wu's car. However, the military truck driver did not stop and sped away. Mayor Wu told reporters: "It doesn't matter that he hit my car, as long as he stopped and said hello, I wouldn't ask him to pay for it. This is too outrageous, too undisciplined." It is reported that Mayor Wu is thoroughly investigating the military truck responsible for the accident.

### Social Services Reader Consultation

Legal Queries

(1) Repurchasing Mortgaged Land

Zhu Hongyi asks: There are two brothers who have already divided their property. The younger brother, because he is doing business elsewhere, mortgaged eight acres of land and one house that he received in the division to his elder brother in 1931 for 400 yuan, stating that it could be redeemed at any time. Now, fifteen years later, the younger brother suddenly demands to redeem the property. However, the currency value is vastly different. How should this be handled?

[Lawyer Qin Liankui answers] If a mortgage contract does not specify a repayment period and allows the debtor to redeem the mortgaged property at any time, and the debtor delays repayment, leading to a change in circumstances, such that repaying the debt with the same amount of currency as at the time of the mortgage would be obviously unfair, the creditor may, in accordance with the principle of changed circumstances, request the court to order an increase in payment. However, if the creditor wants to immediately take possession of the mortgaged property as repayment, both parties must enter into a separate contract. The ownership of the mortgaged property cannot be transferred solely based on the creditor's intention.

(2) Abandoning the Old for the New

Wu Minshi asks: A friend of mine has been married to Ms. Jia for over eight years and has a child of each gender. However, Ms. Jia's personality is eccentric, and the relationship between the couple is extremely weak. Last autumn, my friend met Ms. Yi, and after getting to know each other, the two became close. Before long, their friendship developed into love. Unexpectedly, Ms. Yi discovered the truth. My friend then filed for divorce from his wife. At first, Ms. Jia used sweet words to deceive my friend and made a verbal promise, signing her name on a divorce agreement (without witnesses) that my friend had written. When she later realized she had been deceived, she questioned my friend. However, the feelings between the two had already broken down. My friend's intention to divorce is even stronger. From a legal perspective, how should this matter be resolved?

[Lawyer Qin Liankui answers] I will answer the question in two parts: (1) A consensual divorce must be in writing and must have the signatures of two or more witnesses. The so-called divorce paper, having no witnesses, is certainly not legal. (2) A divorce lawsuit must be based on one of the following situations: namely, one, bigamy; two, adultery; three, one spouse subjected to unbearable abuse by the other; four, the wife subjected to abuse by the husband's lineal ascendants, or subjected to abuse by the husband's lineal ascendants such that cohabitation is unbearable; five, one spouse maliciously abandoning the other in a continuing state; six, one spouse intending to murder the other; seven, having an incurable and serious illness; eight, having a serious and incurable mental illness; nine, being missing for more than three years; ten, being sentenced to imprisonment for three years or more, or sentenced to imprisonment for committing a dishonorable crime.

### Elementary School Sports Meet Opens with Grandeur and Enthusiasm on First Day

20,000 Elementary School Students Participate in Performances and Competitions; To Continue for Next Two Days

[Our Report] The 10th Shanghai Joint Elementary School Sports Meet, organized by the Municipal Bureau of Education, held its opening ceremony at Zhongzheng Park in Hongkou at 10:00 AM yesterday. Over 20,000 students participated, marking the first grand occasion since the victory. Mayor Wu personally attended and delivered a speech. The meet was originally scheduled to begin at 9:00 AM yesterday morning, but was temporarily delayed due to the large number of students from various schools participating in group exercises, making it difficult to assemble, and because the Honorary Chairman of the Organizing Committee, Mayor Wu, was attending the Founding Father's Birthday Memorial held at the Great Guangming Theater. The opening ceremony finally began at 10:20 AM. Municipal Secretary He, Deputy Director Li of the Bureau of Education, and all the staff of the Organizing Committee were present at the venue. The Xinjiang Tourist Group also attended to observe. The students from various schools were energetic and spirited. The number of spectators was an unprecedented grand occasion in the sports world since the victory.

Grand Opening Ceremony

All staff and athletes first paraded around the field. The Jiaoyang Institute played music in the melodious sound of military music. The Director of the Organizing Committee, Mr. Zhu, Deputy Directors Xun Mu and Lu Guanliu, and Secretary-General Shao Rugan led all staff, referees, and athletes around the field. School flags were flying and the steps were neat, creating a magnificent sight. After the parade, the national anthem was played, and the flag-raising ceremony was held. Deputy Director Li Ximou of the Bureau of Education delivered the opening speech on behalf of Director Gu. Director Zhu Jun of the Organizing Committee reported on the preparations. After the athletes took the oath, Honorary Chairman of the Organizing Committee Mayor Wu and representative of the Ministry of Education Zhang Tianlin delivered speeches. After the ceremony, the athletes left the field in formation. The 6,000-person group exercise then began, with neat movements and beautiful postures. The track and field events originally scheduled for the morning were postponed to 1:00 PM due to the late hour. All track and field events were able to proceed smoothly. However, the shot put event will need to be resolved by the Organizing Committee today due to impersonation and discrepancies in weight. The high jump event was highly competitive and had not been decided by nightfall, so it was also decided to be held jointly today. Mayor Wu Delivering a Speech (Photo by this newspaper)

Li Ximou's Opening Speech

Deputy Chairman of the Organizing Committee Mr. Li Ximou's opening speech stated in part: "Education is not just about reading and seeking knowledge, but also about physical fitness and sports. Today, with so many elementary school students participating in the sports meet, we feel that education has meaning. I would like to take this opportunity to share two thoughts: First, we need to further promote sports so that all citizens of Shanghai can participate in sports meets. Second, sports are only held once or twice a year, and only last for two or three days. We must pay attention to daily sports at all times. Remember that the purpose of sports is not competition, but physical exercise." Report on Preparations

Director Zhu Jun of the Organizing Committee then reported on the preparations, stating in part: "This sports meet is ten years after the last one. It was approved by the Bureau of Education's meeting a month ago and approved by the Mayor. Preparations began immediately. The time was short, and the funding was not much, but the number of participants in this session is extremely large. The group exercise involved 61 schools, 117 groups, and 5,850 people. The group performance involved 76 schools, 126 sections, 6,817 students, and 147 teachers. The track and field events involved 117 schools and over 2,300 people."

Mayor Wu's Speech

After the report, Mayor Wu delivered a speech, saying: "Today, so many children and guests are participating in the sports meet, which is a good sign of China's progress. Although we have abolished the unequal treaties, we are still not equal to foreigners in terms of physical fitness. We need to exercise more. Today, I have two things to say: First, I don't hope for good results, I hope that sports can be popularized. Second, don't compete for victory or defeat, learn to observe discipline and order."

Representative of the Ministry of Education and Assistant to the National Education Department Zhang Tianlin then delivered a speech, elaborating on the three points of sports and national life, sports and overall national defense, and sports and competitive ethics. Finally, He Dekui delivered a speech, saying: Today, the children are energetic and well-trained. Such a large-scale sports meet is well-organized, which shows meticulous organization.

### Lei Shuping Scores a Last-Minute Header; Youyou Draws with Qingbai; 1-1, Yi Yuan Football Produces an Upset

In the A-League football match between Qingbai and Youyou yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at Yi Yuan Stadium, attended by over 5,000 fans, the situation was intense. As a result of the competition, Qingbai scored a goal in the first half by Li Yichen. One minute before the end of the second half, Youyou's Lei Shuping scored a header, tying the game, which was unexpected by the fans. The match was tense and unparalleled. Youyou defended strictly, preventing Qingbai from achieving success.

Qingbai Attacks First

Li Yichen led the forwards into Youyou's territory. Right winger Jiang Qing received a pass from Xiao Gu and shot towards the center. Li Yichen took the opportunity to knock on the door. Ladi rushed out to save, resulting in an empty goal. Fortunately, Zhang Rongguang saved the day, turning danger into safety. After ten minutes, Xiao Luo crossed from the left corner, but Li Yichen was too hasty and made a fruitless effort. Youyou counterattacked, with Wang Nanzhen launching an offensive on the left, but was blocked by Wu Qixiang. In the melee, at the eighteenth minute, A-Kui passed to Luo Shoufu, who passed to the center again. Gu Yisa feigned a stand-off at Huarong Road. Li Sikai shot powerfully near the goal, and Ladi was unprepared and lost the goal. Qingbai 1-0

Record Opens First

At this time, Mao Hongfa was injured and left the field, replaced by Villa. After contact, Youyou Yunfeng launched an attack from the middle, passing to the front line. Villa held the ball and shot, but it was slightly high and missed. Soon after, Villa passed to the center, and Lei Shuping knocked on the door but was embraced by Qin Bigao. Qingbai took the opportunity to attack, and Jiang Qing penetrated alone and attacked fiercely near the goal. Fortunately, Ladi was quick-eyed and caught the ball, avoiding a disaster. Before long, the first half ended, with Qingbai leading 1-0.

Restart after Break

Youyou made minor changes to its lineup. Wang Chunjian retired, Wang Nanzhen moved back, and Zhu Meilong replaced Nanzhen. Qingbai's forwards Xu Wenkui and Gu Yisa switched positions. Both sides returned to the field, and in Youyou's territory, enemy cavalry could be seen crisscrossing. Li Yichen, Luo Shoufu, and Gu Yisa attacked without success. Brini and Zhang Rongguang parried from left and right, looking busy. After ten minutes, Li Yichen shot from a distance, and the ball flew like an arrow, but Ladi jumped up and caught it. Chen Xiaoping counterattacked, with Cao Qinfang and Liu Shizan supporting from left and right. Unfortunately, they were too short, and Yan Shixin and Wu Qixiang, a pair of iron gates, were difficult to cross. At the twenty-fifth minute, Wu Qixiang accidentally collided with Cao Qinfang, resulting in a free kick, 30 yards from the goal. Brini took the kick, but Qin Bigao embraced it. Soon after, Qinfang received assistance from Shizan and shot from the crowd, but was again blocked by Bigao. At the fortieth minute, Wu Qixiang was injured and left the field, replaced by Xue Peiran. Qinfang

seized the opportunity to enter. Meng Yiliang blocked it into a corner kick. Villa crossed from the right corner, and Lei Shuping rushed out from a cold alleyway, heading it in. Youyou tied the game 1-1. Within a minute, the legal time ended, and Qingbai and Youyou drew. The lineups of both sides are as follows:

Qingbai

Qin Bigao Yan Shixin Wu Qixiang (Xue Peiran) Yongfu Meng Yiliang Gao Baozheng Xu Wenkui Luo Shoufu Li Yichen Gu Yisa Jiang Wenqing

### Practical Problems with Yarn Allocation

More Coarse Yarn, Not Enough Fine Yarn, Difficult to Coordinate with Practical Use; The Replication Association Hopes That Fellow Traders Can Adjust Products

The yarn allocation work jointly carried out by the Yarn Factory Association and the Cotton Yarn Replication Products Industry Association's Yarn Allocation Committee has reached its third phase. The first time was on October 28th, with 5,803 pieces of various counts. The second time was on the 4th of this month, with 5,626.25 pieces of various counts. The third time was on the 11th of this month, with 5,464 pieces of various counts. Each time, they applied for a combined 6,002 pieces of 20-count standard yarn. The replication industry has repeatedly complained that the counts applied for and the counts received do not match, causing some complaints. According to sources from the yarn factory industry, the allocation is based on the production situation of each factory. The Textile Management Committee is waiting for the Replication Association's list to consider adjustments. According to news from the Replication Association, before the first yarn allocation, the application books reported by the dyeing and weaving, knitting, underwear, towel and blanket, and hand-woven cotton industries showed 409 pieces of coarse yarn below 16 count, 3,088.25 pieces of 20 count common yarn, 1,619.5 pieces of 32 to 42 count medium fine yarn, and 47 pieces of fine yarn above 60 count. The yarn allocated by the yarn factories each time always has an excessive surplus of coarse yarn and a severe shortage of medium fine yarn. In the most recent period, only about two-thirds of the original application amount of 20-count common yarn was obtained. However, the total amount of coarse yarn below 16 count reached 1,340 pieces, which is more than three times the original application amount. Among them, for 10 count yarn, the original application was for over 20 pieces, but this time 776 pieces were allocated, which is more than 36 times the original amount. This has led to an increasing shortage of medium and high-quality fine yarns. Medium fine yarn is also a common commodity used by small and medium-sized factories to weave woolen fabrics and knitwear, underwear handkerchiefs, etc., and the insufficient distribution is particularly inconvenient. The Replication Association has consulted with the industry to consider adjustments, and last time they returned several hundred pieces of 10 count yarn after receiving the allocation. This time, not only has it not decreased, but it has increased further, which is a major headache. The yarn allocated by the Textile Construction Company has tried to be as close as possible to the practical use of the replication industry, and fine yarn has been particularly well maintained. The Replication Association has expressed its satisfaction with this. According to Pan Shihao, the person in charge of the Replication Association, both the allocating and receiving parties should be mutually tolerant and understanding in order to cooperate. There must be a considerable reason for the large amount of coarse yarn on the yarn factory side, and it is hoped that the industry can adjust its products to accommodate this raw material. Therefore, several hundred pieces have been carefully considered in the previous and current allocations. However, at the same time, it is hoped that the yarn factory industry will pay attention to this de facto dilemma and provide assistance. Mayor Wu has long expressed that yarn allocation must be in line with practical use, and there should be adjustments from the next allocation onwards.

### Insufficient Distribution of Rayon; Central Trust Bureau's Investigation Still Not Completed; Small Factories' Purchasing Leads to Black Market Price Increases

[Report from this Newspaper] It is reported that the second batch of 2,000 cases of rayon from the Central Trust Bureau has already been loaded onto ships in Japan and is on its way to China, and should arrive in Shanghai within days for distribution to stabilize the price of rayon. It is estimated that of the Central Trust Bureau's first batch of 4,800 cases of rayon, only about 2,000 cases have been distributed up to the previous month. After the arrival of the second batch of 2,000 cases of Japanese rayon, the total inventory will be sufficient for the distribution volume within the year.

Also, the price of rayon has recently soared again due to supply falling short of demand. It is reported that the silk weaving industry association's members sent the application forms for November to the Central Trust Bureau, but the Central Trust Bureau has not yet completed the investigation, so the distribution quota is temporarily shorter than the previous month. Also, the Textile Construction Company has also started to suspend distribution since last week. Small factories, unable to continue receiving allocated goods, and also being forced by production needs, had to purchase from the market, which created an opportunity for holders to raise prices.

### Silk Weaving Industry Loan; Machines Not Allowed as Collateral; Flexibility Allowed When Loan Expires

[Report from this Newspaper] The 375 member companies of the Shanghai Silk Weaving Industry Association, after the approval of the Four Joint Offices, and especially after applying for loans, the industry association once applied to the Central Bank for permission to use machines as collateral. It is now known that this request has been rejected by the Central Bank. If factories wish to apply for loans, they must still use raw materials at 30% of the market price or finished products at 70% of the market price as collateral. It is rumored that the authorities, in order to understand the difficulties of businesses, have agreed to consider flexible solutions when the loan expires. The deposit period is three months, with interest calculated at a monthly rate of 5%. The loans are undertaken by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. Other institutions, such as the Central Trust Bureau, provide loans through the Bank of China. The Farmers Bank of China provides loans through the Bank of Communications.

### Excessive Business Tax; Cigarette Industry Seeks Amendment; Native Cloth Industry Also Seeks Exemption

[Report from this Newspaper] The City Chamber of Commerce believes that the business tax burden on cigarette wholesalers in the city is extremely heavy. At the request of the industry association, it has requested the Finance Bureau to change the method of collecting business tax on each item and to crack down on cigarette shops and street stalls without store numbers or licenses in alleys and streets in order to protect legitimate commerce. As for the new method of collecting business tax, the cigarette industry association suggests two options: (1) Formulate a simplified method for collecting cigarette business tax separately, and fill out the amount of business tax to be paid in simplified collection based on the quantity and price allocated in the factory's delivery note, and take it to the Finance Bureau to pay the tax due in one go. Or (2) Specify a special rate for collecting cigarette business tax, and use the profit obtained by each wholesaler as the standard for collection.

Also, the Shanghai Native Cloth Merchants Association believes that the producers and consumers of native cloth are all poor people who cannot bear the burden of business tax, and has requested the City Chamber of Commerce to request the Ministry of Finance to approve exemption from collection. It has also telegraphed the Chamber of Commerce Federation to appeal on its behalf.

### Difficulties in Transporting Tea Due to Procedures; Industry Asks for Separate Improvements

Since the government allowed goods for export to be temporarily transported on account and required export within three months, with the guaranteeing merchants responsible for paying taxes if overdue, there has been a turnaround in the tea export trade. However, merchants feel that the guarantee certificate, which stipulates that it must be guaranteed by other stores, is quite difficult. At the same time, due to the slow handling of goods by government agencies, and the fact that most Zhu Jun do not have tax agency personnel, more than 10,000 boxes of tea that have been manufactured by Zhejiang's industry merchants are piled up in places such as Haoba and Cao'e and cannot be exported. Currently, tea merchants in Shanghai and Hangzhou are requesting the government to change the guarantee certificate procedure to joint guarantee by the same industry, and to request the tax bureau to set up on-site personnel first, and to have the Shanghai Agricultural Bank provide proof for the boxes of tea that have been manufactured but have not been transported to Shanghai in advance due to tax reasons.

### Fir Timber Prices Rise

In the timber market, fir timber prices have been rising sharply. Due to difficulties in the source of supply from Fujian, market prices have risen. Foreign pine is stable due to news of sharp price increases from abroad, and sellers are mostly stopping sales.

### Business in Northern Goods Trade Is Sluggish

[Report from this Newspaper] Among the Northern goods, red and black dates, walnuts, and other products are often prepared by the people of Jiangsu and Zhejiang as winter supplements. The annual peak season is from July to October. During this period, merchants from other places come to Shanghai to handle business in preparation for sales in the winter. However, according to people in the industry, the recent situation in the Northern goods trade has been uneventful. The market prices of various goods tend to be sluggish. According to reports, the main sources of supply for various goods in the industry are the areas along the Longhai Railway. The more well-known ones include red and black dates, almonds, melon seeds, and walnuts from Tianjin and Jinan, Shandong. Recently, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has been transporting goods from these two places, so the mutual exchange of goods is relatively smooth. Secondly, golden needle mushrooms, peanuts, melon seeds, etc. from Gaoyou and other places in northern Jiangsu mostly come from Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Jiangyin and other places. Recently, due to the pacification of the local area in northern Jiangsu, the arrival of goods is also smoother than before. Unfortunately, the weather has been cold late this year, and the purchasing power of the general rural population has been greatly weakened due to the low price of grain, which has affected the sales of goods. People in the industry believe that because various industries in the market have been sluggish recently, they are afraid that the industry's prospects this winter will not be able to get rid of the shackles of the recession.

### American Sugar Industry Investigation Team Arrives in Shanghai; Investigates Whether American Varieties Can Be Promoted in China; Two Team Members Fly Directly to Taiwan for Investigation

[Report from this Newspaper] The head of the American Sugar Industry Investigation Team, Mr. Landies, arrived in Shanghai at 9:00 AM the day before yesterday. There are two other members of the team, who are said to have flown directly to Taiwan for investigation. According to related people, Mr. Boer is a well-known sugar industry expert in the United States. He was ordered by the Ministry of Agriculture to come to China for investigation. His main task is to first study the possibility of planting a large amount of American sugar cane in China. In the past, American sugar cane was tried in Sichuan, and the result was that the sugar production rate increased to about 60%. In the past, the Japanese also achieved very good results in planting American sugar cane in Taiwan. Mr. Boer's second task is to study the production and sales situation of world sugar after Taiwan returned to China, as the situation has changed dramatically and needs to be studied. After inspecting Taiwan, the team may go to Hainan Island to study the possibility of planting a large amount of sugar cane on the island. The reporter interviewed Mr. Boer yesterday afternoon, but he could not express many opinions due to the fatigue of the journey. However, he learned that he will probably fly to Taiwan this Thursday, and Peng Shaoguang, a technician from the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute specially appointed by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, will accompany him.

[Central News Agency, Beijing, 11th] Professor Pei Fei, an expert on international issues, gave his first public lecture in Beijing at Peking University at 4:00 PM today, entitled "Can All Countries of the World Be Organized for Peace?" After being introduced, Professor Pei Fei gave a 90-minute lecture, stating briefly: In the past 100 years, mankind has experienced two world wars, which is the most tragic century in human history. In order to prevent future wars, national borders are no longer necessary. Mankind should establish a world country, and the current countries should retreat to the status of provinces and cities in this future organization, but still be able to retain local characteristics, laws, and lifestyles, especially in culture, and still be self-reliant. He also said that this world country cannot be realized in the short term. It must go through a transitional period. If the current United Nations can be improved, there will be an organization that is stronger than all countries and can sanction and subdue countries that endanger regulations. Then the world country will definitely be formed in the future. Mr. Pei also stated that the United Nations is supported by Western countries, and whether it can continue to exist can be determined after a test, and this test will definitely come in the short term.

### Inspection Record of Chahar-Suiyuan Border Area, Inside and Outside the Great Wall (2)

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Hang Zhou

The troops of the Twelfth War Area are not many, perhaps the fewest of all war areas in the country. In terms of military strength alone, Fu Zuoyi is far from being the enemy of He Long, the commander of the Joint Defense of the Five Provinces of Shanxi, Suiyuan, Chahar, Hebei, and Shaanxi of the Communist Army, and Nie Rongzhen, the commander of the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Military Region. The Twelfth War Area has jurisdiction over the entire Suiyuan Province, the entire Chahar Province, thirteen counties in northern Shanxi, and the Yulin area in northern Shaanxi. For such a vast defense zone, Fu Zuoyi only has two armies: the 35th Army and the Provisional 3rd Army, as well as a cavalry division and a supplementary division. In addition, there are the 38th Division guarding Datong and General Ma Zhanshan's 5th and 6th Cavalry Divisions, which were transferred from the Second War Area to Fu Zuoyi's command. As for the Communist Army, He Long and Nie Rongzhen have a combined force of more than 150,000 men. Fu Zuoyi, with fewer troops, drove He Long and Nie Rongzhen's troops into the Taihang Mountains. This was due to the dedication of the officers and soldiers and the cooperation of the people. Therefore, he called the Jining Campaign, the decisive battle between the Kuomintang and Communist forces in Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan:

[The Victory of the People's Will and the Soldiers' Resentment!]

The Datong·Jining·Zhangjiakou Trilogy

The Jining Campaign was triggered by the Communist Army's frantic attack on Datong starting on August 3rd. If Datong fell, not only would Taiyuan be in danger, but Suiyuan and Baotou might be surrounded again. At that time, Fu Zuoyi was stationed in Guihua and repeatedly telegraphed the Communist authorities to stop the attack on Datong, otherwise it would probably cause a major war. When the telegram persuasion was ineffective, Professor Zhou Beifeng of Shanxi University was sent to Jining and Fengzhen in late August to personally persuade He Long, Xiao Ke, and others to stop advancing. This person disappeared after arriving in Zhangjiakou, but the fighting around Datong intensified. The isolated army in Datong was struggling to defend itself, and the situation was precarious. Fu Zuoyi was forced to convene a meeting of officers above the rank of regimental commander in Guihua to discuss countermeasures. The officers issued a unanimous roar: "Rescue Datong!"

Therefore, General Dong Qiwu was ordered to lead three divisions: the 31st Division, the 17th Division, and the 11th Division, to send troops from Suiyuan and Baotou, and the 101st Division as a backup team. On September 5th, they first fought with the Communist Army at Zhuozi Mountain. The National Army advanced with a heavy heart. As the saying goes, if you don't fight, you don't fight. Once you fight, the mournful soldiers will surely win! The Communist Army in Zhuozi Mountain was ordered to defend to the death for two days, but the National Army took it down within two and a half hours, and continued to advance along the Ping-Sui Railway towards Jining. Jining has a dangerous terrain and the most solid fortifications. The main strongholds in the suburbs, such as Tiger Mountain, Wo Neng Mountain, and Tie Jun Mountain, all have bunkers built of steel and concrete, with five layers of various shapes of barbed wire, electric wire, and two outer moats. The streets and houses in the city are also equipped with street fighting fortifications. The Communist Army gathered its forces there, reaching seventeen brigades and fifty-one regiments, claiming that they would annihilate the National Army.

The Battle of Jining began tragically on September 10th. Although the troops of the Twelfth War Area have been reorganized, they are not equipped with new equipment, and still use old weapons. The price paid for attacking such modern fortifications is huge. The two armies surrounded each other layer by layer. General Dong Qiwu was also surrounded in the Communist Army's circle and did not eat anything for two days and two nights. In the melee between the two armies, the rigorously trained National Army demonstrated their skilled combat techniques, fighting on their own, one against ten, and fighting bravely. The Communist Army suffered heavy casualties, but still stubbornly resisted with fortifications. After four days and nights of bloodshed, the National Army was almost unable to hold on, but when the National Army could not hold on, it was also when the Communist Army was about to collapse. At this critical moment, the National Army's backup team - the 101st Division - arrived in time to join the battle, captured the main strongholds in one fell swoop, and completely recovered Jining on the 14th. The number of Communist Army corpses on the battlefield reached 23,700, and the injured were twice as many. The National Army suffered about 5,000 casualties.

With Jining captured, most of the main force of the Communist Army has been defeated, and the siege of Datong has been lifted, and the road to Zhangjiakou has been opened. However, the National Army did not continue to advance, giving the Communist Party a chance, hoping that they would accept Chairman Chiang's proposal to cease fire for ten days and resume negotiations. Unfortunately, the Communist Party rejected it; at the same time, they also publicized that they would use 500,000 troops to defend Zhangjiakou and annihilate General Sun Yingzhong's troops near Huailai. This is tantamount to another act of challenge.

Dong Qiwu led the four divisions to stay in Jining for twenty days, clearing the Communist Army within Suiyuan. After twenty days - on November 5th, they began to advance towards Zhangjiakou. Beforehand, they obtained intelligence from the Communist Army that heavy troops were deployed along the railway line, while the Great Wall line was very empty. They detoured fifty miles, and marched rapidly from north to south, completely beyond the expectations of the Communist Army. They rushed to Zhangbei in one breath. The Communist Army in the city was still singing and dancing, completely unaware of the movement of tens of thousands of troops. They were caught off guard and most of them were annihilated by the National Army. The major fortresses on the Great Wall line, such as Langwo Gully and Shenwei Terrace, were all taken down by the National Army in a quick battle, sweeping down with irresistible force. In seven days, they advanced five hundred miles, and entered Zhangjiakou without a fight at 11:50 am on the 11th. Nie Rongzhen, the Communist Army's defending general, gave a "last fond look" and fled after setting the city on fire. This fire burned terribly, leaving an eternal mark of hatred on the people of Zhangjiakou.

The Zhangjiakou train station after being burned

### The Shattered Zhangjiakou

We spent half a day observing the situation in Zhangjiakou after the robbery. In front of those sturdy buildings that were burned down, in front of those damaged, delicate and huge machines, ... the people after the robbery pointed to us with tears in their eyes, and we accepted their tears one by one; we also saw anger on their faces, and we accepted their anger one by one. During the inspection in North China, I deeply felt that the Japanese had a long-term intention to occupy North China, so they focused on construction and development; they were less energetic in Central and South China. In Zhangjiakou, the construction of the Japanese in the past eight years has been quite considerable. The defeated Japan surrendered, and we took over many constructions intact. If we use these Japanese constructions as part of the capital for building the country, perhaps the lives of the people would have improved. But the Communist Party is unwilling to do so; it claims to "represent the interests of the people," but in fact, it does not know how much hatred it has with the Chinese people, and it wants to cut off the vitality of the people everywhere. When it retreats in Zhangjiakou, it sets fire to the city, as if it has to do so. (The fate of the cities that were occupied and then retreated by the Communist Army is the same). But what it burned is not something that belongs to the Kuomintang government, which it considers hostile (it only makes the Kuomintang government bear more responsibility); what it burned belongs to the country and the people. If the Communist Party is not hostile to the entire country and patriotic people, there is really no reason to do so.』 If it is said that making the entire Chinese economy bankrupt is the basis of the Communist Party's "revolution," so that the poor have no choice but to follow it to rob and loot, then it is even more unwise! What I saw was: even the poorest people, when they mention the Communist Party - no, the suffering people call it the "Bankruptcy Party" - their eyes are filled with anger!

According to the survey statistics of the Temporary Political Affairs Committee of the Twelfth War Area, among the forty companies and factories originally in Zhangjiakou, such as the electric power company, the petroleum company, and the flour mill, only the water company was not damaged. According to local people, this was because the Communist Army did not have time to destroy it. The rest were either completely destroyed or partially damaged. The main industrial areas of Zhangjiakou are in Xuanhua and Xiahuayuan, where all the factory parts were also destroyed. In particular, the power plant in Xiahuayuan, with a generator of 20,000 kilowatts, was completely destroyed. The total amount of the loss is impossible to estimate. God knows when it will be able to restore its former appearance!

Following the route, we first looked at the North Power Plant, which originally had a 300-kilowatt generator. The workers were picking up parts, repairing and assembling them. Minsheng Electric Power Co., Ltd., located in the downtown area, only has a charred shell left. In the telephone bureau, the damaged parts are scattered all over the place. The original 4,000 automatic telephone sets were taken away by the Communist Army, and the rest were burned. Now the Ministry of Communications Telephone Bureau only brought 31 manual telephone sets to maintain telephone communication. Several female operators are already "veterans of three dynasties." In a chat, they told me: "The Eighth Route Army is even more ruthless than the Japanese."

"Why?" I asked in surprise.

They swept their eyes over the destroyed parts, and then looked at me, as if telling me: "You should have known it long ago"!

### "Prodigal Sons" Blow Up Water Towers, Shaking Up the Workers' Minds

When we arrived at the train station, everything we saw was heartbreaking: the overturned water tower, the fragmented locomotive and carriages, only a few charred wooden station buildings and the faces of the workers sighing in the ruins. A worker in his seventies said: The Eighth Route Army burned the station on the evening of the second day before the arrival of the National Army. He was sleeping on the kang when he was awakened by a flash of fire. He counted and found that there were a total of twelve fires. He watched his "partners" in life - everything at the station - was all over. He had no idea, and the resentment made him ashamed. He was ashamed to see the Chinese doing such a useless thing on their own land! He wanted to jump into the fire! The Eighth Route Army used more than twenty tons of yellow explosives to blow up the water tower. With a sound like the collapse of the sky and the cracking of the earth, his mind was cleared instead. He pointed to the water tower and said to us: "I built it under the humiliation of the enemy; now it is destroyed by the prodigal sons! Sir, I want to rebuild it! When you start work, don't forget me."

The Zhangjiakou Grand Iron Bridge was tragically cut in half, like a patient who is half-paralyzed

### The Grand Iron Bridge Was Tragically Cut in Half, Like a Patient Who Is Half-Paralyzed

The Zhangjiakou Grand Iron Bridge is a great project, and the bridge is more than a mile long. When we saw it, it had been cut in half, like a patient who is half-paralyzed. The method used by the Communist Army to destroy this bridge is very peculiar, and probably only the Communist Party members who have attended the "Destruction University" can think of it.

Yellow explosives were placed in the center of the iron bridge, and two locomotives were driven towards it from both ends. After wiping away a tear, the driver of one of the locomotives broke a part of the machine. The locomotive was stopped at the bridgehead and did not move forward. The driver of the other locomotive had no choice but to open the throttle, and he jumped out of the car first. The locomotive drove to the center and detonated the explosives. It was blown to pieces, and the bridge was blown off like a sugarcane. The debris fell on the already dry Qinghe River, as if to provide permanent proof of the Communist Party's masterful masterpiece. The person in charge of the Ping-Sui Railway Administration Machinery Section has a general investigation report on the damage along the east and west lines with Zhangjiakou as the center, east to Huailai and west to Yanggao. (1) Damage to the east line: A, 42 bridges and culverts. All the steel rails, sleepers, fishplates, track spikes, and screws on the bridges were mostly lost. B, about 20 kilometers of the line were damaged, more than 550 steel rails were lost, and more than 18,000 sleepers were lost. C, the buildings of the stations along the line, except for Ningyuan Station, were all burned down. (2) Damage to the west line: A, more than 150 bridges and culverts were almost completely destroyed. B, 800 to 900 steel rails were lost, most of the sleepers were gone, all the power poles were destroyed, and the water towers of Chaigoubao and Tianzhen collapsed. (3) Equipment damage: A, 16 locomotives were damaged to varying degrees. B, 12 passenger cars and 117 freight cars were damaged. C, 80% of all equipment was taken away by the Communist Army, and more than half of the rest were destroyed.

If Zhan Tianyou, the "father of the Ping-Sui Railway," knew about it underground, I think he would definitely beat his chest and cry!

After the Railway Bureau rushed to repair it, the section between Zhangjiakou and Beiping can be opened to traffic in mid-month; the section between Zhangjiakou and Datong is severely damaged, and the repair is costly and laborious. Materials are being purchased and civilians are being hired to carry out emergency repairs in stages, which are expected to be completed in one month.

Due to time constraints, we only saw one-tenth or two-tenths of the damage, but that was enough for us. A tragic picture has formed in my mind. This picture is constantly moving in front of my eyes, and suddenly it changes its appearance. I seem to see Mr. Zhou Enlai and other "eloquent" gentlemen of the Chinese Communist Party in Beijing and Shanghai shouting slogans such as "democracy," "freedom," "peace," and "happiness" at the meeting table. I have no leisure to satirize them. I only feel that if Mr. Zhou Enlai and others know what his "comrades" are doing on the land on which the people's lives depend, he must have lost that "shameless" courage, otherwise, he must be a patient of hysteria.

### The Six Hundred Thousand Jews Support the Jewish National Movement Will Force the British to Change Their Attitude

— Translated by our editorial department from World Report, South

There is a risk of guerrilla warfare throughout Palestine. Jews and Muslims are moving towards extremes, with no room for compromise. Which side Britain will favor is indeed a question worth noting, as it will have a profound impact on the situation in the Middle East.

Jewish underground forces have already begun military activities, attempting to attract 100,000 Jewish refugees to participate. Arabs are also armed, and if Britain concedes to the demands of the Jewish National Movement, they are also prepared to take similar measures.

Jewish leaders used to oppose violence, but the reason why extremists are gaining ground is that the general public believes that only force can compel Britain to change its policies. A rebellion by the large-scale Jewish National Movement supported by 600,000 Jews in Palestine is quite possible.

The British are now assessing the balance of power between Jews and Muslims.

Jews threaten to take immediate action against the British. Five divisions of British troops, totaling 80,000 men, have failed to prevent attacks by extremists, although the organization of these extremists has less than 5,000 members. Now, the main Jewish underground forces are preparing to engage in combat with 65,000 trained personnel, some of whom have already begun sabotage activities. On one night, 151 sections of the Palestine Railway were bombed, and on another occasion, eight railway and highway bridges were destroyed simultaneously.

According to a dispatch from the London correspondent of "World Report" weekly, British officials believe that the Jews in Palestine can mobilize 100,000 people, including 24,500 local police officers and 25,000 demobilized soldiers who participated in the Libyan, Syrian, Greek, and Italian campaigns of World War II. Weapons and officers are available.

Arabs in Palestine do not have such training, equipment, or organization. However, if the 1.1 million Arabs in the Holy Land go on strike, as they did during the rebellion from 1936 to 1939, they could paralyze the entire country. Many Arabs possess weapons. It is recalled that in 1938, Arabs carried out 5,708 sabotage incidents, and they are now likely to copy the previous methods.

British Garrison

The assistance provided by the seven countries of the Arab League to the Palestinian Arabs will generally be greater than what they received during their pre-war rebellion. This will include money, weapons, and clandestine non-regular troops crossing the border.

The British troops stationed in the Middle East amount to 250,000, with 100,000 stationed in Egypt, one division stationed in Iraq, and other troops stationed in Cyprus, Greece, Libya, and the Red Sea area. However, troops and suppression measures cannot destroy a resistance movement supported by a large number of people, as the Nazi Party had already learned in Europe.

Arab and Jewish rebellions cannot drive the British out of the Middle East, but they can hinder the demobilization of British troops, cut off the supply of oil, and prevent Britain from establishing a new base in Palestine to transfer the troops stationed in Egypt and the Suez Canal area there.

Involving the Soviet Union

Britain feels that once Jewish and Muslim conflicts and rebellions officially occur, restraining British forces in the Middle East, Soviet pressure will inevitably take advantage of the situation. The Soviet troops stationed in the Balkans number one million, and they may take action towards the Middle East at any time to force Turkey and Iran to concede. At the same time, the Soviet Union may also provide propaganda and economic assistance to the Arab rebellion.

Britain hopes to divide Palestine to seek a political solution. However, the Arabs oppose division, and the Jews insist on establishing a Jewish state in Palestine.

Since compromise is impossible, Britain has been forced to favor either the Arabs or the Jews. When making the final decision, the first thing Britain needs to consider is which side is weaker and which is stronger.

Based on the above description, this question is indeed a difficult one.

### The Young and Vigorous Cabinet of the British Labour Party Tries to Prevent the Conservative Party From Making a Comeback

— Xu Yuwei

Recently, British Prime Minister Attlee announced a partial reshuffle of the cabinet. In addition to creating the Ministry of Defence and appointing Naval Minister Alexander as the first Defence Minister, the personnel of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Civil Aviation, and Colonial ministries have also been greatly changed. State Secretary Noel-Baker has been appointed Air Minister, and Foreign Office Undersecretary MacNeil has been promoted to State Secretary. Noel-Baker and MacNeil have always been regarded as young and vigorous figures in the Labour government. This time, the former has been transferred to an important position, and the latter has been promoted to a cabinet member, which shows that the Labour cabinet is now striving to promote new figures and generate new forces. In this way, it can deal with the Conservative Party at home, which has great potential and is trying to make a comeback, and deal with the difficult issues of world diplomacy, military affairs, etc., in the age of atomic power abroad. Political observers in London believe that one of the motives for the British cabinet's reshuffle this time is to recruit young and vigorous figures into the cabinet, and MacNeil's promotion is one example. Noel-Baker and MacNeil have represented Britain at international conferences many times. Based on the materials published in British newspapers, a brief description of their lives is as follows:

Air Minister Noel-Baker

Noel-Baker was born in 1889. One of the characteristics of Noel's family is that they believe in the doctrines of the Religious Society of Friends (Quaker) and are members of the Society of Friends. The Society of Friends is a branch of Christianity that advocates peace and non-participation in war. This extreme pacifist doctrine has had a profound impact on Noel's current dedication to international peace work.

Noel was not only a good student with excellent character and learning but also an eloquent debater and a brave athlete. In the 1911 British-American University Games, Noel won the one-mile race. Since then, he has twice served as the captain of the British team participating in the Olympic Games.

During World War I, Noel did not enlist. After the war, Noel began to enter politics. He served as a secretary in the League of Nations section of the British delegation to the Paris Peace Conference. Since then, most of Noel's political career has been in diplomacy, continuing to work tirelessly for the sacred cause of international peace! When the Labour Party came to power in 1929, Noel was elected as a member of the House of Commons, representing the Labour Party, and served as the private secretary to Foreign Secretary Henderson. Later, in 1936, Noel served as a representative of the British delegation to the League of Nations General Assembly. At that time, Noel had become a handsome and elegant young diplomat, actively participating in the international diplomatic arena as a protagonist. In the spring of 1937, Noel solemnly warned the British government and people that Germany was preparing for war, and Britain would regret it if it did not catch up quickly!

In the first two years of this war, Noel worked in the Ministry of Information. His main task was to broadcast in various languages to the people in the occupied areas of Europe, reporting to them the truth about the war situation and enhancing their confidence in the final victory. With a figure known for his eloquence to take on this task, the completeness of the results and the magnificence of the effect were both inevitable and natural. In January 1942, the government headquarters promoted Noel to Undersecretary of the Ministry of War Transport. This was the beginning of Noel's joining the cabinet to participate in major planning.

After the end of World War II, Noel served as State Secretary in the Labour cabinet, which won a great victory in the general election. This was his first official appointment as a cabinet member. The main work that Prime Minister Attlee and Foreign Secretary Bevin gave him was to represent Britain at various international conferences, especially international conferences convened by the United Nations organizations that had economic and social characteristics. As for those political and diplomatic conferences that were complex in nature and subtle in relations, such as the Four Foreign Ministers Conference and the Paris Peace Conference, Foreign Secretary Bevin personally attended. When the first session of the United Nations General Assembly was held in January of this year, Noel was one of the five representatives of Britain. He was also the representative of Britain to the Economic and Social Council and the Relief and Rehabilitation Council, and he also participated in the opening ceremony of the World Food and Agriculture Conference. In addition, Noel also served as the chairman of the European Emergency Economic Committee, the chairman of the European Food and Agriculture Conference, and the chairman of the Central European Inland Transport Organization.

State Secretary MacNeil

MacNeil is a Scot. When he was studying at the university, his talent for handling affairs and his fluent eloquence were appreciated by local people. He was once elected as a member of the Glasgow City Council. MacNeil also traveled to South Africa as a representative of the Imperial Parliamentary Delegation. Traveling to the Americas and Africa in his youth increased his knowledge and benefited him a lot. After graduating from school, MacNeil engaged in journalism, working for the "Scottish Daily Express." His articles were insightful and he was a successful journalist.

In 1941, MacNeil was elected as a member of the House of Commons. Later, when Noel served as Undersecretary of the Ministry of War Transport, MacNeil also entered the Ministry of War Transport, serving as Noel's private secretary. The two had a very harmonious personal relationship, and they also had the same views on national affairs. After the partial reorganization of the Labour cabinet this time, MacNeil succeeded Noel as State Secretary, "following the old rules," which shows the close relationship between the two.

After the Labour Party came to power last summer, MacNeil was appointed as Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs, assisting Foreign Secretary Bevin, and was highly trusted by the latter, who regarded him as his right-hand man. In November, MacNeil was ordered to go to Athens, Greece, to investigate the complicated situation there. After returning to China, he provided many reasonable opinions, which were even more valued by the authorities, and everyone regarded him as the successor to the Foreign Secretary. This promotion to State Secretary is a preparatory step for taking office as Foreign Secretary in the future.

Current Affairs Commentary

### No Change in US Diplomacy After Republican Victory

— Chu Yukun

The world events of the past week that are worth noting are the following three: (1) In the US congressional elections, the Republican Party, which has been in opposition for 14 years, suddenly won a victory, which will not only control the 40th US Congress, but also have great hope for the 1948 presidential election. (2) The sudden turn of events in the Chinese political situation, with President Chiang suddenly issuing an order to stop the conflict, has almost become "big news" in newspapers around the world, all using large characters for headlines and publishing them in prominent places. (3) The Trusteeship Committee of the United Nations General Assembly discussed the trusteeship issue, but no result was discussed due to the divergence of opinions between the United States and the Soviet Union. The fact that the United States insisted on managing the islands in the Pacific that were previously mandated by Japan is particularly noteworthy.

No Change in Diplomacy After the US General Election

The US Congress held a general election on the 5th of this month. As a result of the vote count, the Republican Party, which has been in opposition for 14 years, was able to overwhelm the Democratic Party and win a victory. Although it was within our expectations, its significance is very significant and cannot be ignored by any country. President Truman still has two full years before his term expires, and after the opening of the 40th Congress, the House and Senate will be controlled by the Republican Party. Therefore, all actions of President Truman, whether in domestic or foreign affairs, will inevitably be subject to congressional constraints. Especially in domestic affairs, the Republican Party has long been dissatisfied with Truman's domestic policy. Once the 40th Congress opens, it will inevitably weaken the wartime powers previously exercised by the Truman government. As former President Hoover said, "In recent years, the entire world, including the United States, has been moving to the left on the path of planned economic omnipotence; but now the United States, after this general election, will be the first country to abandon this path."

However, in terms of diplomacy, the Republican victory has no major impact. This is because the diplomatic policies adopted by Secretary of State Byrnes are greatly influenced by Republican foreign policy spokesman Vandenberg. Whether the United States attends any international conference, Vandenberg is always present. Austin, the chief representative of the United States to the United Nations organizations, is also an important figure in the Republican Party. According to Vandenberg's speech at Lake Success on the 8th, "No matter what the political system in Washington is, the United States will continue to fully support the United Nations. The United States government is bound to cooperate faithfully with all countries in the world, so that the United Nations organization can achieve peace and justice."

The Trusteeship Issue is Still Difficult to Resolve

The United Nations General Assembly began discussing the trusteeship issue on the 4th of this month. However, the United Nations Charter does not have clear and practical provisions for the trusteeship system. Therefore, the interpretation of the so-called "directly related countries" varies among the representatives of various countries. The United States has submitted to the Security Council a draft trusteeship agreement for the islands in the Pacific that were previously mandated by Japan. Although it advocates transferring all the islands to the United Nations for trusteeship, the United States still retains its management rights. The United States clearly wants to establish military bases on these islands, which will inevitably arouse the suspicion of various countries towards the United States. Therefore, it is difficult to predict whether the draft submitted by the United States will be adopted by the Trusteeship Committee. Needless to say, the Soviet Union will inevitably express its dissent. The United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand will also not express their approval.

The United Nations General Assembly will continue to discuss this trusteeship issue next week, and I am afraid that there will be several more verbal battles.

Left Wing Gained Power in French General Election

France held a general election on the 10th of this month to elect members of the Fourth Republic National Assembly. According to the results of the vote count, the Communist Party has gained an advantage, obtaining 2,800,094 votes, accounting for 29% of the total votes. It is followed by the People's Republican Party, which obtained 2,270,000 votes. If the Republican victory in the United States is a symbol of the rightward turn of American politics, then the victory of the Republican Party in France can be said to be the beginning of the leftward turn of French politics. Therefore, the results of the general elections in the United States and France are an excellent contrast in the current international situation. Which path will the world take in the future? It is now at a crossroads. Moreover, the shadow of the post-war recession has also begun to be cast on countries around the world. (November 12th).

### Sakhalin Island

— Zuo Qi

According to a Reuters dispatch from Moscow on October 25th: 18,000 Soviet citizens have arrived at various ports in southern Sakhalin Island in the past few months to work in newly built collective farms and factories. In addition, a United Press dispatch from Moscow on November 3rd reported: The Soviet authorities published a report on the first year of the new five-year plan. 14 coal mines have been developed in southern Sakhalin Island, and 45 food agencies have been established.

Sakhalin Island, known as Karafuto in Japanese and Sakhalin in Russian, was originally Chinese territory but was later invaded and occupied by Japan and Russia. Russia exchanged the Kuril Islands with Japan, and the entire island was assigned to Russian territory. After the Russo-Japanese War, Russia was defeated and ceded the area south of 50 degrees north latitude to Japan. At the end of World War III, the Soviet Union officially fought against Japan. When Japan surrendered unconditionally, the Soviet Union re-entered its territory in accordance with the Yalta Agreement.

Sakhalin Island is located directly north of Hokkaido and is separated from Siberia by the Tatar Strait. The island is rich in forests, coal mines, and aquatic products.

### Polish Representative to the United Nations, Dr. Lange … Maintains an Independent Attitude … Often Opposes the Soviet Union

— Translated by Nan from the "Chamche Lihgao" Weekly

Polish Ambassador to the United States and Representative to the United Nations, Lange

Polish Representative to the United Nations, Lange, is a rather noteworthy figure. He is a socialist, representing a government led by the Communist Party, and was previously a US citizen, and is now speaking on behalf of a country within the Soviet sphere of influence.

Lange has always been one of the most cheerful of the many representatives at the United Nations, but since August 17th, when he took over as President of the Security Council, he has often appeared serious and tired. His decisions have sometimes been fiercely criticized by representatives of Western countries, and at other times have incurred the displeasure of Soviet representatives.

Observers believe that Lange has received strict orders from the Warsaw government not to oppose the Soviet Union on important issues. However, when discussing world issues, he often takes quite different views and positions from Gromyko, although he ultimately supports the Soviet Union on important issues.

His attitude towards Gromyko is not entirely consistent. For example, Lange, regardless of Soviet opposition, supported Ireland's accession to the United Nations. When the Security Council discussed the issue of Iran, he did not agree with the Soviet proposal to remove the issue from the agenda, and when Gromyko angrily withdrew from the Security Council meeting, he remained in his seat.

Advocates Creating Understanding and Maintaining a Friendly Attitude

This scholarly diplomat advocates creating understanding between the major powers and hopes to maintain friendly relations with both the Soviet Union, Poland's closest neighbor, and the Western countries.

The occasional inconsistencies between Lange and Gromyko have led to various rumors that Warsaw will force him to resign, but he denies these rumors. Currently, Lange is the representative of Poland to the United Nations and also the Ambassador to the United States, but in the near future, he is likely to give up the position of Ambassador and concentrate on the work of the United Nations. Lange's past experience is quite unique. Since 1934, he has lived almost continuously in the United States and has studied and taught at seven American universities. Finally, in 1943, he obtained US citizenship. Two years later, he was invited to serve as Ambassador to the United States for his political advocacy of Polish-Soviet friendship. He returned to Warsaw, gave up his US citizenship, and became a Polish citizen again. However, his wife, who is originally from Ireland, and his seven-year-old son are still US citizens. Lange himself is still a professor at the University of Chicago, now only on leave.

An Economist Developed Political Interests

Lange is an economist who developed an interest in politics during the war, publishing many articles and speeches on the conflict between the Soviet Union and the Polish government-in-exile in London. He believes that the government-in-exile is controlled by reactionary elements and urged free elements to break away from it and join the Union of Polish Patriots supported by Moscow. This proposal was accepted by the three powers at the Yalta Conference in 1945.

At the same time, at the invitation of the Poles, he made a six-week trip to the Soviet Union. In May 1944, Stalin personally received him and talked for 140 minutes. Afterwards, Lange said that he believed that Stalin wanted a strong Poland, "without forcing new Poland to conform to the Soviet Union and to determine its political, economic, or social form."

Informal Talks are Popular with Reporters

This Polish diplomat is five feet three inches tall and weighs 176 pounds. News reporters like him very much because he is informal and very willing to chat casually with reporters, and they can often get excellent explanations of Soviet actions from him.

Lange's greatest hope is to bridge the gap between the Soviet Union and the Western countries. Poland is between East and West, and this policy is of course most beneficial to her. Lange, who was originally a US citizen and is also a Soviet economist, is certainly very suitable for this job. But for a diplomat of a small country, this job is really too difficult. Now that his month-long term as President of the Security Council has expired, perhaps he can feel a little relaxed.

### A Eulogy for Guan Liang's Paintings

— Zhu Yingpeng

Since the start of the Anti-Japanese War, Mr. Guan Liang moved to the rear, taking on a teaching position at the National Art Academy, and has recently returned east with the school. During these eight years, he consistently immersed himself in painting, striving tirelessly. His skill has progressed from purely Western styles to the creation of a new national art. Looking at his achievements, one feels as if "the fortifications have been completely renewed, and the banners have changed color." I deeply admire that he did not waste his time during these eight years.

More than twenty years ago, when Mr. Guan first returned from Japan, he collaborated with Mr. Chen Baoyi and Mr. Xu Jiaogu to hold an art exhibition. He initially brought the Western Impressionist style, which strongly stimulated the emerging art movement. Due to their honest attitude towards creation and solid foundation, scholars unanimously admired them, believing that real skill is by no means comparable to those who superficially imitate, decorate appearances, and deceive the world for fame. Mr. Guan and others' initial contributions to art, apart from those in the art circle, received little attention from other areas. Honest artists only have the spirit of immersing themselves in research, and no habit of presumptuous arrogance. Therefore, the deeper their learning, the more lonely their lives. Unreasonable phenomena are always and everywhere, especially in Chinese society, which is most difficult to explain.

The rise of nationalism in the new literature and art once stirred up a wave, though not a raging tide, but to this day, it has gradually been recognized as the primary truth in both tangible and intangible ways. Initially, this was only the result of a few like-minded people exploring each other, gaining a central understanding, and when their views converged, they could not help but put it forward as a call. The reason we need nationalistic literature and art is not stubborn restoration of the old ways, but rather to awaken the natural existence based on national consciousness and the local customs and sentiments of national history, while also absorbing Western culture as new blood to restore the nation's youthful life. At the time, it was also deeply felt that after the May Fourth Movement, scholars and the general youth, although understanding that the declining old Chinese culture was insufficient to meet the trends of the times, inevitably reversed the roles and forgot the nation's standpoint in the liberation of thought. This weakness was exploited by ambitious countries, even to the point of a political crisis of "calling another's father." During the period of conflicting opinions, the like-minded people inevitably suffered some attacks, which was expected. However, everyone had considerable self-confidence and did not care about anything, especially the few colleagues engaged in fine arts, who simply kept silent and continued their research. Mr. Guan Liang is one of them.

In his recent works, in addition to Western painting, he has also moved on to create new traditional Chinese paintings.

His traditional Chinese paintings specifically use ink to express impressions of various figures, especially local dramas, which can be called "ink paintings." Originally, the Western Impressionist school arose under the influence of Eastern painting. There is a consistent thread in it. And Mr. Guan's paintings not only purely take local customs, but the divine changes of ink are both subtle and free, with a deep and lasting charm, especially reaching the highest level of traditional Chinese painting. The figures depicted are only a few strokes, but the humor and expression jump onto the paper. One can imagine the author's keenness of feeling and the vivacity of spirit. Sometimes the brushstrokes are as light as wandering silk, sometimes as vigorous as soaring dragons, both ethereal and grounded. There is not much coloring, but the simpler it is, the more stimulating it becomes. He often uses simple vermilion, yellow, cyan, emerald, and light red colors, combined with ink, which feels especially cold and beautiful. Although each painting contains the advantages of the Western post-Impressionist school, it is different from the faces of Cézanne, Gauguin, and Matisse. If such ink figures are appreciated with the narrow boundaries of ordinary traditional Chinese painting, I am afraid it will not stop there. Originally, artistic creation must be something that predecessors did not have, and ordinary people naturally cannot get used to it, so they are unwilling to taste it. But true skill has been tempered many times, and it is not a matter of one morning or one evening. The bitterness and sweetness in this cannot be pretended by those who deliberately make strange things to seek fame and reputation. Luo Liangfeng liked to make ghost interest pictures to satirize connoisseurs, which inevitably hurt sincerity, but for the author, it is not necessarily a kind of criticism.

His Western paintings are mostly landscape sketches. In recent years, he has traveled to Sichuan, Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Guizhou provinces, not hesitating to face difficulties, and has sketched historical sites and famous scenic spots in various places. The inspiration of nature and the response of history have opened up his artistic field. Although he only uses watercolor due to the lack of oil painting materials, the composition and layout are exclusively for great rivers, towering mountains, dangerous peaks and flying waterfalls, which are purely the style of traditional Chinese landscape painting. Although the paintings are small, they have a lofty and magnificent view. The brushstrokes are bold, free, elegant and outstanding, just like the painting methods of famous painters of the Jin and Tang dynasties, especially the trees, which are super wonderful. This is very different from the brushwork of figure paintings. The colors are delicate and refined, the atmosphere is complete, and the bones and appearance are clear. If you observe with the eyes of traditional Chinese painting, there is not a single one that is not the most wonderful landscape painting. The ease with which he handles it can directly win the seat of Wu Mojing. In Western landscape paintings, there is certainly no such sentiment. In this way, it can be called a watercolor painting with national spirit. Mr. Guan has never made traditional Chinese landscape paintings, but because of his deep skills in Western painting, he can meet the essence of the principles of traditional Chinese landscape painting without expecting it, and he can pass through it with one stroke, and have the joy of being able to do everything with ease. If it is like the so-called eclectic school in Japan, it cannot avoid artificiality and crude imitation, and it is absolutely impossible to compare. When Mr. Guan was in Sichuan, several traditional Chinese painters saw his landscapes, and the composition was strange and shocking, and they could not help but ask to borrow a copy to keep it as a painting draft. The situation of traditional Chinese painters is like this, which proves that Mr. Guan's works contain a very strong Chinese flavor.

I have been separated from Mr. Guan for several years. After meeting, I admire his skill and progress, and I also recall the journey we shared in the new art movement. It is truly emotional to look back and forth. Mr. Guan will hold a solo exhibition recently, so I especially record a few words, and I hope that those with true vision will not consider it a biased view.

### Psychological Description in Literary Creation

— Shen Xianyuan

In a successful literary work, the author must go through the three processes of observation, experience, and feeling. Therefore, in addition to the expression of images, psychological description cannot be lacking. When a literary writer begins to create, he should not ignore the psychological life of people, just as he does not ignore the description of people's actions. At the very least, it should be used as an auxiliary technique for realistic description, because the so-called "person" not only lives an animalistic life, but is also a social existence. When he lives in a certain specific society, he not only needs material satisfaction, but also has his own desires, emotions, thoughts, and psychological responses. Temporarily speaking, human life has both its internal and external aspects, and these internal and external aspects are unified in the whole personality of the person and expressed externally.

Therefore, there is a kind of writer who, when choosing a theme, specializes in exploring the strange states of mind of individuals and psychological reactions, such as madness, idiocy, and erotic mania, etc., and makes deep excavations of the original instincts and feelings of mankind; and dissects the hidden and abnormal side of human life deeply without concealment. In the usual situation, these writers' works express the strange psychological phenomena of mankind. This special preference for creation methods can only be used as a source of appreciation and recreation for those who have the same preferences. In China, in the past, some people advocated psychologicalism in literature and wanted to use it as a call to form a trend. In fact, this is very undesirable. A correct understanding of people certainly not only requires knowing his appearance, but also going a step further to know his inner heart; but if you do not understand the situation, you can only get an external understanding of people. People exist in society. For creation, like everything that human beings do, the importance of individuality cannot be ignored, but individuality is always social individuality, and its growth and occurrence have its social roots. If a writer only pays attention to the psychological exploration of the characters in his works and despises his external environment, or even ignores the physiological basis of the psychological phenomena that are revealed through action, and does not pay attention to the organic and complex relationship between the two and the social reasons for the existence of the characters' psychology, then he will only make the content of the work conceptualized and fall into the tendency of abstract psychologicalism; at the same time, the psychological activities of the characters in the work will only become a vacuum, a subjective fabrication of the author.

In the new creation method, just as action description is valued, the importance of human psychological description is not ignored either. But it has already transcended the individual-centered point of view and further noticed the expression of the psychology of the masses. When they make psychological descriptions of characters, they not only do not forget the social existence of people, in most cases, people's psychological reactions are always expressed through action; they pay more attention to the process of human psychological construction, and human psychological phenomena are not fixed, but always show diversity due to changes in time and changes in circumstances.

However, there is still something that should be paid attention to in the process of expressing the constitution of human psychology, that is, it must be accompanied by the development of action, and the psychological activity of people must be regarded as coming from and subordinate to the development of their action. That is, to suggest the truth of his psychology to the reader from some of the protagonist's behaviors and actions.

However, some writers, when they engage in psychological descriptions of characters in their works, mostly use lengthy psychological monologues by the protagonists in their works, or use dialogue-style philosophical debates, but this kind of creation method has become a thing of the past. Literary works are most taboo to accommodate philosophical speculations, and psychological monologues are too lengthy and can easily make people feel bored, so I think this kind of creation method should also be paid attention to.

### Fuchun Teahouse—A Yangzhou Sequel, Part Five

— Hong Weifa

When you want to eat refreshments in Yangzhou, you should never forget the Fuchun Teahouse. In the eyes of the people of Yangzhou, Fuchun not only has good refreshments and good tea, but also clean tables. The tea is brewed with a mixture of Longjing, Zhulan, and Kuizhen tea leaves, with Longjing for its color, Zhulan for its fragrance, and Kuizhen for its taste. If a cup of tea can have both color, aroma, and taste, isn't that enough to be praised? As for the tables, those in ordinary teahouses are greasy, but at Fuchun, the customers can rest assured. Even if the white sleeves are pressed on the table for a long time, they will not be stained. Because every table there is scraped and polished every day.

Inside this Fuchun, there are some rooms that had certain names in the past. Although there were no plaques or the like to mark them clearly, they were generally recognized, such as the place where the elders of the village met. The rooms were relatively short, so the light was relatively poor. Most people didn't want to go in, and they didn't want others to go in, because that would disturb the elegant atmosphere of chanting poems and playing chess. The Great Achievement Hall was because a man named Jiang regularly drank tea there. In the past, his father was both virtuous and learned, and people called him a saint. The son of a saint is undoubtedly a little saint. The place where the little saint sits is called the Great Achievement Hall. Why not call it Sheng Gong Mansion, which seems more interesting and accurate, is unknown. As for the Buliaoliaozhai (So-So Studio), that was because several retired people used to drink tea there. They had no social status and were not well-off in life. They held a "so-so" attitude towards everything, so this place became the So-So Studio. In addition, there is the so-called Education Bureau, which is the gathering place for people in the education sector, and the Land Temple, which is too small in area and resembles a land temple. All of these seem to be less interesting than the naming of the above three places.

However, these three places have been distinctly different in recent years. The village elders in the Elders' Hall have gradually metabolized and gradually become scarce. The tea drinkers there seem to have changed to a group of people who hate noise and avoid trouble, who only want to forget the bustling reality in these relatively dark places. There is no longer the elegance of the past. As for the Great Achievement Hall and the So-So Studio, after the changes of the times, people of all colors are complete. The Little Saint is making a living in all directions and cannot often go to the Great Achievement Hall, and some tea drinkers who have retired and dispersed have already risen and fallen differently and can no longer reunite at the So-So Studio. In addition, the teahouse owner Chen Buyun has recently stopped being responsible and has handed over the business of the teahouse to the original tea workers to run together. Therefore, there is one less person who has a face full of spring breeze and enthusiastic hospitality. This makes the older tea drinkers inevitably feel the vicissitudes of life.

However, the Fuchun Teahouse was originally just a flower shop, and it only became a teahouse in the early years of the Republic of China. Before it became a teahouse, it was just a place for some old seniors to sit. All the tea sets and so on were prepared by themselves. They drank tea, chanted poems, played chess, and painted in the flowers every day. When they needed refreshments, they always bought them from elsewhere. It is said that sometimes they even flew cups and enjoyed the moon there. At that time, they named it the Borrowing Group. Later, it was probably because the number of people gradually increased, and it was inconvenient to deal with, so the small owner of the flower shop, Chen Buyun mentioned earlier, officially opened the teahouse. And those old seniors all retreated to the inside of the Elders' Hall for a while. Because they have a deep relationship with this place, they will be treated preferentially in some respects. For example, if you go to brew a pot of tea early in the morning, you can leave half of the tea leaves and come back to brew it again in the afternoon, and only pay for one pot of tea, which is a right that others cannot enjoy. Now that the old are dying, this situation no longer exists. Therefore, if we talk about the current Fuchun Teahouse from the past Borrowing Group, the so-called sense of vicissitudes will be extraordinarily increased.

### An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood - 91

— Ye Jingfeng

After the "tuk tuk" sounded twice, lasting only half a second, suddenly a very loud, loudspeaker-like, piercing voice shouted, "Ah er…!" Followed by gibberish, speaking in Japanese, as if announcing something.

"Damn, Aunt!" Tiger whispered: "Maybe the Japs are calling that mastiff, right?"

I had no time to answer Tiger's question, only to give an order like, "Quick, find a large bolt cutter in the truck, and bite open a hole in each of the bottom row of those gasoline barrels... Quick!"

It was almost nine o'clock at this time. Tiger went to look around among the rows of trucks, and suddenly found a foot-long bolt cutter in a truck. He ran to the mountain of gasoline barrels, and used the cutter to bite the curled edge of the bottom row, one by one, prying and twisting, forming a small opening. Tiger was quite strong and dexterous, and doing this work was like a seasoned professional, and without a sound. These oil drums were probably five rows deep, each row about forty large round oil drums; each layer was stacked on top of each other, about eight or nine layers high, totaling nearly two thousand barrels.

While Tiger was prying the oil drums, I was busy straightening the gasoline pump pipe of the oil pool, smoothing it on the ground, with the pipe head facing the gasoline drums. There were a total of twenty-four air pressure pumps here. One by one, I released the upper and lower valves, and the other task was to turn the crank handle, so the oil flowed out in large streams, like opening a tap. When Tiger had pried open dozens of gasoline barrels, I had only cranked the third one here. However, the concrete ground of more than ten zhang in circumference had been flooded with gasoline, and the rest was spreading under the oil drums like lake water. Tiger stepped through the gasoline and came over. Seeing me cranking, he didn't wait for me to instruct him, and ran to the last pump at the south end and started cranking it.

We cranked the pumps for only a while, and the announcer's broadcast had already stopped. Fortunately, these oil pipes were all laid flat on the ground, and the oil flowed out from the pipes, making only a faint sound of running water, which could not be heard beyond ten yards. So we could work with peace of mind.

After about twenty minutes or so, we only pumped seven or eight oil pools dry. The released gasoline was already more than enough to start a big fire. I suddenly thought that the work of setting fire also required a considerable amount of time to arrange, so I ran to Tiger and quietly told him to continue working, and I would arrange the things for setting fire. Tiger smiled when he heard this, and said, "Why bother with such a big deal? Just run a considerable distance before leaving and fire a shot or two, won't that ignite it?" I told him that we couldn't do that. If a gunshot rang out, the Japs would know the direction of our actions.

Of course, we are not incapable of doing what is done in the movies, releasing all the oil, grabbing a car, and just before leaving, firing a few shots to ignite the gasoline, and then driving straight out of the restricted area. How simple, neat and happy that would be. However, the goal of the film is to make the audience move their eyes. The screenwriter and director have neither personal experience nor knowledge of deep spy work, and they don't care whether the plot is reasonable or not, so they just do what they want.

— Shaofu

Ji Kang said in his Treatise on Preserving Life:

"A mistake in conduct, perish in the small. Accumulate the small into loss, accumulate loss into decay. From decay comes whiteness, from whiteness comes old age. From old age comes the end, vexed as if without cause. Looking up and looking down, none is not so."

Preventing the small and stopping the gradual, in people's daily life and behavior, is indeed a major test and a difficult subject. The reason lies in the fact that "small" is not big, and "gradual" is not sudden. Mr. Ji is by no means exaggerating or alarmist. Not only is this true of people's physiology, but how is it not true of everything in society?

Queuing to wait for a bus or buy a ticket, this seems to be a small matter. Because it is a detail, people often ignore it. Therefore, it is very difficult to maintain order in many public places. On the other hand, if everyone respects the principle of first come, first served and gets on and off the bus or enters the place in an orderly manner, it will not only avoid many unnecessary accidents, but also maintain public order and make everyone's spirit of abiding by the law particularly solid. We really cannot estimate its influence in nature.

Queuing to wait for a bus is just one example. Those traitors who are now subject to the sanctions of national law, are they not all extremely intelligent people? It is only because of a single mistake in the beginning that they gradually sank and could not extricate themselves, which is why they are in the situation they are in today.

News Reference Material

### Two Examples

— Mai Ye

After reading the two Central News Agency dispatches on the newspaper of October 30th, I became more and more confused. I do not misunderstand what the dispatches speak of, however, I can only understand an "approximation" or a "ballpark estimate!"

The first is the Canton dispatch on the 29th from this news agency, which said that the Yuehan Line light railway vehicle traffic was open, "the loading capacity of each vehicle could be increased to 190 tons, at a speed of 29 kilometers per hour, and each gallon of gasoline could travel five miles." The description of the event is very clear; what is not very clear is the lack of uniformity in "units" and "units."

"Tons," may I ask, what kind of "tons" are they? If this telegram was sent by "Agence France-Presse," we could infer that it is a "metric ton," i.e., one thousand kilograms. If it is a "Reuters" telegram, then it must be a "British ton" (also known as "large ton," i.e., long ton or gross ton), equal to two thousand two hundred and forty pounds. Also, if it is an "Associated Press of America" telegram, then it is of course a "US ton" (also known as "small ton," i.e., short ton or net ton), no doubt about it. Since it is said to be a vehicle, of course it is not the "ton" of a ship, but when talking about the load of cargo, some people also use "measurement ton" (equal to one hundred cubic feet). And what I see in the Central News Agency's "tons," I can only understand "approximately!"

"Speed of 29 kilometers per hour" while the gasoline consumption rate is "five miles" per gallon. Couldn't they convert "five miles" into "eight kilometers" to make it easier for people to understand? Once the units are unified, readers can easily understand that the car can travel for an hour with only about three and a half gallons of fuel.

The second telegram is from Shenyang, saying that there is a surplus of soybeans in the Northeast, and the local production management bureau is using soybeans to manufacture wool in Shenyang, "It is said that the elasticity and luster of the wool made from soybeans are no different from wool."

May I ask: is there a problem with the wording of "wool made from soybeans"?

If we say there isn't, then can we say, by analogy, "silkworms made from wood," "kapok made from paper," "nylon made from coal," ...?

Forcing ourselves to say "yes," it is still very difficult to understand. Because what is manufactured from wood and wood pulp is just "rayon" that resembles natural silk, and what is manufactured from paper pulp is just "staple fiber" that resembles cotton. (According to research, before World War II, both Germany and Japan manufactured large quantities of it to save the lack of cotton sources. The Japanese abbreviated it as Su-fu, and it seems that there was no word "artificial cotton.") And "nylon" is just an organic chemical synthetic fiber of carbon, which is neither natural silk nor "glass!" There are many kinds of "artificial fibers" similar to this!

"Casein" in milk can also be extracted into fiber for spinning, and so can soybeans. The fiber obtained from soybeans, of course, also falls into the category of "artificial fiber," but because the fiber used in spinning is not as long as the fiber of "rayon," it is also called "artificial short fiber." Natural wool is shorter than natural silk fiber and natural cotton fiber in spinning, so "artificial short fiber" can also be sloppily called "artificial wool," but the word "artificial" is indispensable!

A man and a woman have a baby after marriage, "what's so special." If one day, scientists can really "manufacture" a little girl from a liter of rice and two bushels of wheat, I believe that no matter how much she looks like, she must wear an "artificial" (rather than human-raised) hat. Otherwise, what will become of it?

I don't want to nitpick. I hope that the news staff of large news agencies and newspapers can "divide the labor" and "specialize." Doesn't foreign countries have "science reporters" and "science editors"? Secondly, I hope that all units of measurement on the newspaper are unified, and do not have li, kilometers, city li, nautical miles, miles... all active on the page at the same time! Do you think that an army that advances ten miles but retreats fifteen kilometers has advanced or retreated?

### Heroic Men and Beautiful Women

— Saintly Purity

·A Wonderful Tale from the Northeast Army·

I recently learned from a letter from a friend in the Northeast about many wonderful romances involving servicemen.

Since the two new armies (the New First Army and the New Sixth Army) that fought in India and Burma transferred to the Northeast, they have been welcomed everywhere by people from all walks of life.  The successive National Revolutionary Army troops were also warmly welcomed because they fought for eight years and shed much blood.  Naturally, today, the people of the Northeast view these National Revolutionary Army soldiers, especially those who fought in foreign lands, with extraordinary respect.

Most notably, many women have broken through the traditional mentality of "looking down on soldiers." On the contrary, beautiful young ladies, young girls, and even Japanese women are all very eager to approach the warriors.

Today, the soldiers in the Northeast are mostly very neat and handsome, and exceptionally mighty, wearing clean and beautiful leather overcoats, woolen military uniforms, and leather riding boots.  Ordinary schoolgirls, especially those around twenty years old, are particularly envious of young officers. They feel that these young officers are handsome, young heroes on horseback.  Therefore, many officers who could not afford to marry during the war now have beautiful wives. In the three cities of Shenyang, Changchun, and Jinzhou, weddings are held almost every other day, and the attendees are all servicemen.

The soldiers are a little poorer than the officers and do not know how to dance, so their targets are mostly Japanese women. They can find temporary comfort from the Japanese waitresses in those cafes for very little money.

In the interior, soldiers are not only not welcomed by others, but are also often viewed with discriminatory eyes. Women are even less likely to be respectful. The typical person who looks down on soldiers forbids them from dancing at dance halls.  But in the Northeast, it is the opposite, which is enviable. We believe that in this post-victory era, it is not surprising that there are many wonderful stories involving servicemen.  We cannot say that "servicemen cannot fall in love." However, as long as there is some restraint in the atmosphere of freedom, and it is not too foreign, then it is acceptable. We hope that the warriors will handle romances with a normal attitude, and that the common people will also regard the military with a normal and natural attitude.

Intelligence Test

### Memory of Time

— Yu Feng

Do you find yourself often late for the office or school? Perhaps you don't have a very accurate clock or watch, which is an important reason; but on the other hand, your memory of time is too weak, which is the main reason why you are late.

You may not believe it, but you can test yourself now. This test is the simplest and most accurate:

Look at a watch, write down the time you see in the most detail (the number of seconds should also be written), then hide or move the watch away. Start silently memorizing (estimating) the time that has passed since you looked at the watch (in seconds). After a few minutes, quickly write down the number of seconds you memorized, and then quickly look at the watch again. See if the elapsed time is similar to the time you memorized. If it is still close, then you know you are not likely to be late; if the number of seconds memorized exceeds the actual elapsed time by a lot, then you must be an early arrival, otherwise, you will easily be late.

A psychology expert has tested many of his students from time to time with this test. Often, when the watch shows 110 seconds have passed, many people only record that 60 seconds have passed, while others record that 200 seconds have passed, a difference of more than three times. And the students who recorded 60 seconds were found to be often late after investigation.

### Change in Weather

— Li Sheng

I don't know why, but it's already mid-October in the lunar calendar, and it's still very hot. For a few days, you could almost wear a single shirt at noon, like the climate of early summer.

Because of the hot weather, the broad beans planted in the fields in the countryside already have very lush branches and leaves. If it continues to be this hot, they may bloom. A few days ago, it was reported that peach trees in a certain village in Changzhou blossomed in autumn, which is also due to the abnormal climate.

If it is not cold when it should be, there will be more epidemics. There have been many cases of diphtheria in these days. Yesterday, an old man next door was still working as a laborer during the day, but suddenly died this morning, said to be from "suffocation"; in short, if it snows this winter, the vegetables and wheat seedlings in the countryside will definitely be greatly damaged, but if it doesn't snow this winter, then the plagues next year will be even worse. Why does God want to make fun of us?

The Story of a Psychoanalyst

### The Innocent Murderer

— Xu Guiting

In America, the first book about psychoanalytic stories has been published recently, "The Innocent Murderer" by Nigel Balchin. It tells a shocking story about a psychoanalyst who tries to solve the "mystery of life" for a British veteran suffering from a nervous disorder, in order to cure his illness, and hopes to cure his mental illness before he commits murder. Unfortunately, the ending is an irretrievable tragedy: the patient shoots and injures his wife, almost beats the psychoanalyst as well, resulting in a complete uproar.  The police in London are racking their brains, and finally he reveals a past encounter that he cannot reveal, and then ends his own life with a pistol. The whole book is very long. "Reader's Digest" has shortened it into a story of ten pages, and the translator has further abridged it for the convenience of readers. This shocking psychological crime story unfolds like this:

The psychoanalyst, Meane, sat quietly in his chair, staring at the carpet. He was terribly tired and really hungry. So many people always asked him for help.

His wife, Polly, said to him: "There are too many people who want your help. Oh, Mrs. Leeson called to make an appointment to talk to you. I told her she could come here on Thursday afternoon. Is that okay?"

Meane replied: "Um, of course."

A few days later, Mrs. Leeson arrived as scheduled. She was very thin, with dark skin, and about twenty-five years old. She was very small.

When she came in, she acted quite flustered, but her attitude was still quite serious. Meane felt a little uncomfortable and forced a kind smile at her. She smiled slightly and shook hands with Meane.

Meane then asked, "What difficulties are you having?" She replied, "I don't have any difficulties. The one with the problem is my husband, Adam. He always wants to murder me."

"Um," Meane said, "Then he should see a doctor."

Mrs. Leeson frowned and said, "That's what he hates. He doesn't like seeing doctors. During the war, he saw many doctors, so he hates seeing doctors."

Meane nodded and said, "Then tell me what happened!"

"It happened like this: I am an American. I came to England to travel. In London, I met Adam, and later married him in early 1940."

"How old is he now?"

"He is twenty-eight years old. He was a fighter pilot in the Royal Air Force. His combat record is very outstanding."

"Is your marriage happy?"

"Indeed, it is very happy. He was initially very enthusiastic about his life in aerial combat, but later became tired of it. He found a ground service job on the Asian battlefield. Later, I heard that he was missing. He was fighting over Rangoon when his plane caught fire and crashed with him. Almost a year later, he actually survived. According to him, he jumped out of the plane with a parachute and fell into a tree. After climbing down, he met a group of natives. They treated him very well, but unexpectedly sold him to the Japanese devils. The Japanese devils were afraid that he would escape, so they broke one of his legs, but he was still able to find an opportunity to kill a Japanese devil with a piece of wood, and then escaped back here."
