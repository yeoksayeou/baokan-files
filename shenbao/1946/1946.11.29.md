### Submission of Draft Constitution to the National Assembly; Chairman Explains Drafting Process; General Assembly Begins Formal Discussion Today

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] The third National Assembly convened at 9:25 AM on the 28th. Secretary-General Hong first reported that the National Government had announced a list of 1,744 delegates, of which 1,624 had registered by this morning. A total of 1,369 delegates were present today, exceeding the legal quorum, and the session was declared open. The presidium consisted of Tseng Chi, Pai Chung-hsi, Chen Kuo-fu, Chu Ching-nung, Hu Shih-hua, Ho Cheng-chun, Liang Han-tsao, Huang Yun-su, Tuan Hsi-peng, Hsu Fu-lin, and others, taking turns as chairman. Hu Shih served as the chairman of the General Assembly. The secretariat first reported on the minutes of the second General Assembly and the receipt of congratulatory telegrams and requests for leave from delegates. The chairman then announced that the Draft Constitution of the Republic of China would be submitted to the assembly by Chiang Chung-cheng, Chairman of the National Government. Secretary-General Hong was dispatched to invite Chairman Chiang. After a short while, Chairman Chiang, accompanied by Hong, walked to the rostrum. Chairman Chiang, in military attire and wearing medals, held a copy of the constitution draft with a large red silk cover. He approached the rostrum, exchanged salutations with the chairman of the General Assembly, and then presented the draft constitution to the chairman of the assembly with both hands. Hu Shih accepted it on behalf of all the delegates. At that moment, the lights flashed, and applause resounded. A new chapter in the history of the Republic of China began at this time, which was 9:40 AM. Chairman Chiang then stepped to the podium to explain the drafting process of the constitution draft, the teachings of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and the spirit of the Five-Power Constitution. His remarks were concise and to the point. His emphasis on returning power to the people moved the audience. The speech lasted for 30 minutes, during which the delegates applauded more than ten times, displaying great enthusiasm. After the chairman finished speaking, he left the venue. The chairman of the General Assembly then handed the constitution draft to Secretary-General Hong to read aloud, which was completed at 10:52 AM. At that time, the General Assembly announced a recess until 11:15 AM, when the session resumed. Sun Ke spoke about the drafting and revision process of the constitution draft, concluding at 12:15 PM. During the session, Yu Chia-chu, a representative of the Youth Party, submitted a written opinion, expressing his determination to discuss this constitution draft with an open mind. When the Secretary-General read the opinion, the audience applauded again, adding to the vibrancy of the assembly. Finally, Secretary-General Hong reported that a meeting of the presidium would be held in the afternoon, and the fourth General Assembly would continue tomorrow morning. All provisional motions and requests to speak would be handled in the next General Assembly. The General Assembly adjourned at 12:20 PM.

### Sun Ke Reports on Revisions to the Draft Constitution, Article by Article

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Sun Ke's report to the General Assembly on the constitution draft was based on the articles of the May 5th Constitution Draft and its amendments, which he explained one by one:

Article 1 of Chapter 2, General Principles, originally read "The Republic of China is a republic based on the Three Principles of the People." After considering the opinions of all parties, it has been amended to "The Republic of China is a democratic republic based on the Three Principles of the People, for the people, by the people, and of the people."

Chapter 2, Rights and Obligations of the People, Articles 6 to 25, with Article 24 also being modified, stipulates that the people's freedoms and rights may be restricted by law if necessary to avoid infringing upon the freedom of others, avoid imminent danger, maintain social order, or promote public interest. This is to ensure the freedom of the majority.

Chapter 3, the National Assembly, expands its organization compared to the May 5th Constitution Draft by including members of the Legislative Yuan and the Control Yuan as ex officio representatives to the National Assembly. They serve as representatives during the session and remain members of their respective Yuans during the recess, thereby facilitating communication between the government and local representatives. In the original draft, the National Assembly had the power to impeach the President, Vice President, and the heads and deputy heads of each Yuan. This has been amended to only include the power to impeach the President and Vice President.

Chapter 4, the President, also has slight differences. For example, the President must submit any emergency decree issued to the Legislative Yuan for ratification within one month after its issuance. If the Legislative Yuan does not agree, the decree will become invalid, which is a major difference from the original draft. Secondly, the President may convene a meeting of the heads of the relevant Yuans to resolve disputes between the Yuans.

Chapter 5 has many more revisions compared to the original draft. For example, the President appoints the President of the Executive Yuan with the consent of the Legislative Yuan. Article 58: The Executive Yuan is only limitedly responsible to the Legislative Yuan. The Legislative Yuan may pass a vote of no confidence in the Executive Yuan, and members of the Legislative Yuan may not concurrently hold administrative positions. Therefore, it is not a responsible cabinet system. The Executive Yuan may, with the approval of the President, request a reconsideration of a law passed by the Legislative Yuan, which is an advantage of the presidential system.

Chapter 6, Legislation, has slight revisions. Chapter 7, Judiciary, establishes the Judicial Yuan as the highest judicial organ, adopting a committee system with grand justices. Members of the committee and grand justices may not be affiliated with any party.

Chapter 8, Examination, also adopts a committee system. Chapter 9, Control, grants the Control Yuan the power of consent, requiring the President to obtain the consent of the Control Yuan when appointing members of the Judicial and Examination Yuans.

Chapter 10 adds the powers and limits of the central and local governments, adopting a system of balanced power and enumeration. Chapter 11, the provincial and county system, is more detailed than the original draft. Chapter 13 is a combination of the original draft's chapters on national economy and education, and now also includes national defense and military affairs.

### Protecting Political Power and Developing Civil Rights; Hoping to Establish National Law; Chairman Chiang's Speech at the National Assembly

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] The original text of Chairman Chiang's speech after presenting the Draft Constitution at the third session of the National Assembly on the morning of the 28th is as follows:

Delegates of the National Assembly:

Today, the National Government submits the Draft Constitution of the Republic of China to the National Assembly for deliberation. I would like to take this opportunity to briefly report to the Assembly on the process by which the National Government formulated the Draft Constitution, as well as my views on constitutionalism, for your reference.

The National Government's efforts to formulate the Draft Constitution began in 1933, when the Kuomintang of China resolved to task the Legislative Yuan of the National Government with establishing a Constitution Drafting Committee to draft the constitution. By 1936, the draft constitution was completed, and the National Government officially promulgated it on May 5 of that year. This is what is later known as the May 5th Constitution Draft, which is the first stage of the National Government's formulation of the Draft Constitution.

At that time, the National Government originally planned to convene the National Assembly in November 1937 to enact the constitution. Unfortunately, the War of Resistance against Japan broke out on July 7, 1937, and the convocation of the National Assembly had to be postponed. The creation of the Draft Constitution then entered its second stage.

This stage lasted from the beginning of the War of Resistance in 1937 to the victory of the War of Resistance in 1945. During these eight years, the government continuously promoted discussions on the constitutional military proposal and solicited opinions from all parties in order to improve it. Initially, in 1939, the National Political Council organized the Constitutional Government Promotion Committee to further study and revise the May 5th Constitution Draft. In 1943, the National Political Council established the Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Association, extensively soliciting opinions from the people of the entire country on the Draft Constitution in order to gather wisdom and formulate a perfect constitution. This is the second stage in the creation of the constitution.

The time from the victory of the War of Resistance to today is the third stage in the creation of the Draft Constitution.

In January of this year, the government opened the Political Consultative Conference, deciding to revise the May 5th Constitution Draft and to submit the amendment proposed by the Constitutional Government Promotion Committee and the results of the Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Association's study of the Draft Constitution to the Draft Review Committee for summarization and research. Based on the principles of revision decided by the Political Consultative Conference, the articles were compiled, organized, and drafted for amendment. However, after late April, the work was temporarily suspended because the Chinese Communist Party advocated retaining the revision work. It was not until November 18 and 19 that the government held two consultations with the Chinese Youth Party, the Democratic Socialist Party, and social figures, further reviewing, organizing, and supplementing the complete draft based on the principles of revision of the Political Consultative Conference. The Legislative Yuan completed the legislative process on the 21st. This is the Draft Constitution of the Republic of China that the National Government is submitting to the National Assembly today. Although the Chinese Communist Party did not participate in the completion of this Draft Constitution, most of the parties that participated in the Political Consultative Conference at that time agreed to it. The Draft Constitution of the Republic of China took a total of fourteen years to establish, undergoing multiple revisions. Today, the National Government is submitting it to the National Assembly for deliberation. After submitting this draft today on behalf of the government, I recall that our founding father led the revolution for more than fifty years, and after eight years of long-term resistance, our revolutionary martyrs and the military and civilians shed their blood and fought sacrificially, never giving up. Only then were we able to have today's National Assembly to discuss this constitution draft. It can be said that this constitution draft was forged with the blood and tears of the military, civilians, and revolutionary martyrs of the entire country over the past fifty years. Today, on the one hand, I remember how difficult it was to complete this constitution draft. At the same time, I think that after the constitution is enacted in the future, it will be of great importance to the country's governance and the rise and fall of the nation. Therefore, I cannot help but express my sincere views on the constitution and my expectations for the assembly for your consideration.

Accepting the People's Trust and Formulating a Perfect Constitution

Today, after the National Government submits the Draft Constitution to the National Assembly, it can be said that the government has handed over the responsibility of the country to the people of the entire country. From today onwards, the people of the entire country will begin to shoulder this important responsibility. (Applause) All delegates, entrusted by the people of the entire country, must examine the situation, fulfill their responsibilities, and formulate a perfect and feasible constitution in order to live up to the expectations of the people of the entire country. (Applause) Delegates, your responsibility lies in making the constitution. The constitution we formulate should not only be formally perfect, but also be able to be implemented without hindrance. Since the government announced the May 5th Constitution Draft, it has been studied by the people of the entire country for ten years and has deeply penetrated the hearts of the people. The May 5th Constitution Draft was formulated based on the Five-Power Constitution of the founding father. Everyone knows that the Five-Power Constitution invented by the founding father is the newest and most advanced constitution in the world. However, why did the government revise the May 5th Constitution Draft? Why does the constitution draft submitted by the government today not fully conform to the founding father's Five-Power Constitution? I must explain this point today.

After inventing the Five-Power Constitution, the founding father often told us: "Having a good constitution is not enough; there must also be people who faithfully implement the constitution. It is best to have the people who created the constitution implement it, so that the essence of the constitution can be promoted. Otherwise, if the people who implement the constitution do not understand the spirit of constitutionalism, then the implementation of the constitution will not be sure and smooth." I would like to draw your attention to this passage today. The essence of the founding father's Five-Power Constitution lies in the separation of powers and functions, and the separation of political power and governing power. To maximize the essence of this constitution, two conditions must be met:

First, the people who exercise political power must have the ability and habit to control political power and ensure political power.

Second, the government that exercises governing power must be able to abide by the limits of governing power and not infringe on political power with governing power. If the people who exercise governing power do not respect political power and infringe on political power, and at the same time, the people who exercise political power do not have the ability and habit to control political power, then the result will completely violate the spirit of the founding father's creation. Therefore, the Five-Power Constitution is best exercised by the founding father himself, using governing power to protect political power, nurture political power, and cultivate the people's ability and habit to exercise political power, so that political power and governing power complement each other, and the government does not become incompetent and the people do not become powerless, so that the ideal can be achieved. If the people who implement the constitution cannot take the spirit of the founding father as their spirit and cannot fulfill the responsibility of protecting and supporting political power, then abuses will inevitably occur in the future.

Because the central system of the Five-Power Constitution can be said to be a presidential system, if the people who exercise political power do not have the ability to control political power and cannot have appropriate control over governing power, then the president's power will be excessively concentrated, which will inevitably lead to totalitarian politics. This kind of politics is not in line with the current era and is harmful to China and the Chinese nation. (Loud applause)

The Constitution is Enacted for a Specific Period; It Must Benefit the People

Fellow delegates, believing in the founding father's teachings and adhering to the Five-Power Constitution, we must not allow the founding father's Five-Power Constitution to become totalitarian politics and harm the country and the nation. Therefore, I would like to ask everyone today to estimate the ability and habits of our compatriots to exercise political power, and to examine the international environment and the trend of the times. If we implement the Five-Power Constitution today, will the people be able to control political power and not be infringed upon by governing power? I can say that most of the people in our country do not have this ability and habit at present. If we implement the Five-Power Constitution without any guarantee, I personally think it is very dangerous. Of course, with so much talent in our country and the founding father's teachings being so moving, there are many people who have the ability to exercise governing power and understand the spirit of the Five-Power Constitution. However, delegates, you must know that when the people cannot control political power and consolidate political power themselves, it is ultimately a risky attempt to completely rely on the people who exercise governing power to respect political power.

I believe that if I were to exercise the Five-Power Constitution myself, I would be able to take the heart of the founding father as my heart, use governing power to protect political power, nurture political power, and fully develop civil rights. (Loud applause) However, I myself have been fighting for the country and shouldering heavy responsibilities for twenty years since the founding father's death in 1925. Only because the foundation of the country has not been consolidated, constitutional government has not been implemented, and the revolutionary duty cannot be abandoned, I cannot refuse the affairs of the country. Now that the National Assembly has convened, the constitution is enacted for a specific period, and the work of revolutionary nation-building can be said to have come to an end. I personally have no political desires or interests, and I am already sixty years old this year, and I can no longer shoulder heavy responsibilities like I have in the past twenty years. Therefore, I must entrust the responsibility of the country to my compatriots across the country. Because of this, I am particularly concerned about the establishment of the national law, so that its implementation is beneficial to the country and beneficial to the people. (Loud applause)

Hoping for Deep Consideration; Laying a Good Foundation for Constitutional Government

Today, I represent the National Government in submitting the constitution draft to the Assembly. Of course, I respect the opinions of the Assembly. At the same time, from the standpoint of a representative of the people, for the sake of protecting political power and developing civil rights, I am in favor of and support the constitution draft submitted by the National Government today. I believe that the May 5th Constitution Draft is not suitable for today. Today, I contribute my experience of the constitution over the past fourteen years to the delegates, hoping that you will consider the country and the nation deeply and lay a good foundation for the implementation of constitutional government. It must be known that the survival and decline of the country and the prosperity and honor of the nation in the future are all related to whether the implementation of constitutional government is smooth. The responsibility of making the constitution lies with the delegates.

Today, when we make the constitution, we must be fair and sincere, purely for the sake of the country's peace and the people's welfare. We must not be rigid and inflexible, nor should we cut our feet to fit the shoes, ignoring the needs of the people and ignoring the factors of the times. We must gather wisdom, be prudent and comprehensive, and formulate a perfect and feasible constitution so that the people of the entire country can be practiced, so that our founding father and the spirits of the revolutionary martyrs and the war martyrs who died in battle for the past fifty years can be comforted in the ground.

In short, the constitution we want to formulate must be practical and feasible, so that the country can be stable and lasting, and the construction work can be advanced. Only then can people's livelihood be happy, and civil rights will naturally develop and consolidate day by day. By that time, I believe that our founding father's Five-Power Constitution will surely be fully realized. Finally, I wish you all to work together to complete our great and sacred task of making the constitution. (Warm applause) (End)

### Withdrawal of Railway Personnel from Shenyang: Soviet Embassy Issues Statement, Central News Agency Clarifies News Source

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] The Information Department of the Soviet Embassy in China issued a statement at 11:00 AM on the 28th, the original text of which is as follows: Regarding the Shenyang dispatch of the Central News Agency on November 22nd, the Soviet Embassy in China deems it necessary to make the following statement: The Central News Agency reported that the agency had learned from authoritative sources: "After several consultations between the Chinese government and the Soviet authorities, it was decided to send Soviet railway employees back to their country." The Soviet Embassy in China has indeed repeatedly raised the issue of withdrawing Soviet employees from Shenyang with the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. However, the Central News Agency misinterprets the true reason for the Embassy's taking this step. The return of Soviet railway employees to the Soviet Union is not due to their poor health or economic hardship, but rather due to the fact that they have positions but cannot perform their duties. For several months, the Chinese authorities have created a situation that is not only difficult for their work but also for their residence in Shenyang. The Embassy has obtained various information confirming the following facts: the local administrative and military authorities not only fail to provide the Soviet employees with the protection they deserve, but also allow some Soviet employees to become victims of beatings in which Chinese soldiers and police also participate in aiding and abetting, as well as other illegal acts. The private property of most Soviet employees has either been taken away by local officials or looted by Chinese soldiers, making their material environment extremely difficult. At the same time, Chinese personnel of the China Chang Railway Bureau have, in fact, long prevented Soviet employees participating in the Changchun section from actually working in the Shenyang section of the railway. Since the Chinese local authorities have created such a situation in Shenyang, the Soviet employees realize that it is impossible to continue living there. Furthermore, the Central News Agency insists that there are still 200 Soviet employees who will continue to stay in Shenyang, which is also inaccurate. All Soviet employees will return to the Soviet Union within days.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] According to our agency's Shenyang dispatch on the 22nd, regarding the request of some Soviet employees in Shenyang of the China Chang Railway to withdraw and return to their country, the Soviet side had requested to transfer some Soviet employees in Shenyang who were ill, experiencing difficult living conditions, and had less work back to the Soviet Union. Our side expressed its desire to retain them. After several consultations with the Soviet side, our government finally agreed to the Soviet side's request to temporarily allow these employees to return to their country and provided them with transportation convenience. The remaining employees were transported to Tianjin by the Railway Bureau in preparation to embark to the Soviet Union. The government also provided them with travel expenses for their return. As for the remaining one hundred or more Soviet employees, they are still staying with the Railway to continue their work. The above news was learned by our agency's reporter from the China Chang Railway in Shenyang.

### Soviet Withdrawal of Employees Not a Diplomatic Strategy

An Individual’s Opinion on Soviet Statement

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] The Soviet Embassy issued a statement at noon on the 28th regarding the withdrawal of Soviet employees from the China Chang Railway and their return to their country, refuting the Central News Agency's report, which has attracted widespread attention here. This has suddenly brought an issue that has been brewing for more than a month to the surface. The Central News Agency often seeks instructions from the Central Propaganda Department and liaises with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and will provide an explanation in this regard. However, the reporter learned that the content of the Central News Agency's Shenyang dispatch is no different from the official report of Zhang Jianfei, the special commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Northeast. The statement that 200 Soviet employees will continue to stay in Shenyang is also consistent with reality. In order to thoroughly understand the truth of this matter, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has instructed Zhang to conduct a detailed investigation and report, and to contact Zhang Jia'ao and Zhai Shihui for reference. According to a qualified person, the Soviet statement that the private property of most Soviet employees was confiscated or looted may have been due to occasional incidents when the Northeast was newly taken over by the National Army and the order was still chaotic. However, such incidents would never be committed by officers and soldiers of our newly trained National Defense Forces. After the takeover was completed and order was restored, such situations would not occur again. The Soviet statement did not specify the exact time and events. As for the claim that Soviet employees were subjected to beatings in which Chinese soldiers and police also participated in aiding and abetting, we do not know whether any conflicts occurred in the Northeast due to the discord between the White Russians who recently acquired Soviet nationality and the local people. However, we can boldly assume that if Soviet expatriates in the Northeast had indeed suffered such intentional abuse and the Chinese political and military authorities did not provide the protection they deserved, our friendly country, the Soviet Union, would have long been unwilling to remain silent and would not have waited until the Central News Agency reported and refuted it before making a statement. Considering that the direct motive of this statement was purely caused by the Central News Agency's report, we would rather believe that this is merely a question of the accuracy of a news report and do not want to make overly sensitive speculations, believing that the Soviet side's move has a diplomatic strategic nature, causing the currently rumored situation in Dalian and the clouds of doubt spread between China and the Soviet Union to be covered with an uneasy atmosphere, affecting the friendship between the two countries.

### Director of the Treaty Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Issues Statement: Explaining the Contents of the Sino-US Commercial Treaty, Both Sides Enjoy Equal and Reciprocal Benefits

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] Wang Huacheng, Director of the Treaty Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, must issue a responsible statement on the Sino-US Commercial Treaty issue as follows:

After the full text of the Sino-US Commercial Treaty was announced, there have been many comments from all walks of life, but some people seem to not fully understand the contents of the treaty, so misunderstandings are unavoidable. Looking at the criticisms from all walks of life, the most important point is that the strengths of China and the United States are different, and our country cannot enjoy the same equal and reciprocal benefits as the United States based on the treaty. On this point, we have paid close attention to it at all times during the negotiations.

In the entire negotiating process, our government has always adhered to the following three points as its guiding principles:

First, the conclusion of the new Sino-US Commercial Treaty is necessary for us. This point is very easy to understand, because although consular jurisdiction, concessions, etc. have been abolished in the recent Sino-US new treaty, unequal commercial treaties between China and the United States still exist. Most of these treaties only stipulate the treatment that foreigners should enjoy in China, and do not stipulate the treatment that Chinese overseas Chinese should enjoy in those countries. Before the new commercial treaty is concluded, the old commercial treaties are still valid, so the conclusion of an equal new commercial treaty is actually necessary for us.

Second, for matters such as business, residence, and travel, I must provide reasonable guarantees to the citizens of countries that do not discriminate against Chinese people. If I do not provide such guarantees, the relationship between China and other countries will inevitably be in a state of friction and disharmony. If our country wants to encourage the introduction of foreign capital and foreign technology, it is especially inappropriate to allow this state to exist or develop.

Third, the security guarantees that the Chinese government and people need in the economic and cultural fields must be set in all necessary reservation clauses in the treaty; because our country is an industrially backward and scientifically backward country, if there are no such clauses, our citizens will continue to receive equal and reciprocal benefits abroad, but will inevitably be harmed at home. I will now describe in detail the reservation clauses set by our government in the new Sino-US treaty for the study of those who are interested in this treaty. My explanation is by no means intended to boast of the success of the negotiations. In this negotiation process, both China and the United States did not have the slightest intention of seeking unilateral victory. This is a major feature of this negotiation, and I dare to responsibly tell the people of China and the United States. The United States gave sincere consideration to China's difficulties whenever we pointed them out, and our country took the same attitude toward the United States' difficulties. The following reservation clauses were established because of this harmonious atmosphere.

(1) Reservations on the employment of citizens of both parties in each other's territories—Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the treaty stipulates that citizens of one contracting party can only engage in various occupations that are not exclusively reserved for citizens of the other contracting party. Therefore, if one contracting party believes that a certain occupation should be reserved for its own citizens, it can legislate it at any time.

(2) Reservations on the engagement of citizens, legal persons, and organizations of both parties in various undertakings—Article 2 of the treaty stipulates that citizens of one contracting party may engage in commerce, manufacturing, processing, science, education, religion, and charitable undertakings in the other party in accordance with the laws of the other party that are not prohibited, and shall also receive national treatment. However, this right can only be enjoyed in individual capacity and cannot organize legal persons and organizations to enjoy the above-mentioned national treatment. As for foreign legal persons and organizations, although they generally enjoy national treatment in accordance with Article 3 of the treaty, this does not apply when the law provides otherwise. Therefore, either contracting party may still give its own legal persons and organizations certain necessary special treatment, which is completely consistent with the provisions of Article 297 of our new Company Law.

(3) Reservations on the mining rights of both parties in each other's territories—Article 5 of the treaty stipulates that if one contracting party grants the rights to explore and develop mineral resources in its territory to citizens, legal persons, or organizations of any third country, then this right shall also be granted to citizens, legal persons, or organizations of the other contracting party in accordance with relevant laws and regulations. This provision is entirely a hypothesis. Either contracting party reserves the right not to grant any mining rights to foreigners, so the other party does not need to enjoy this right. In addition, the words "in the future" are included in the text of the treaty, specifically indicating that even if either contracting party has granted this right to a third country before the treaty comes into effect, the other contracting party cannot invoke this as an example.

(4) Reservations on the acquisition and disposal of real estate by both parties—Article 8, Paragraph 1 of the treaty stipulates that the people of the two countries shall enjoy the right to acquire and dispose of real estate within each other's territory in accordance with the procedures and conditions prescribed by local laws and regulations, and shall enjoy the same treatment as the nationals of third countries. This provision is entirely based on the principle of equality and reciprocity, and reserves full freedom for the local country's legislation on land administration.

(5) Reservations on copyright—Article 9 stipulates that the inventions, trademarks, and copyrights of citizens, legal persons, and organizations of one contracting party shall be effectively protected in the other party's territory and shall not be imitated, used, or translated. All countries regard copyright as being as important as other property rights. Since other property rights cannot be violated at will, neither can copyright. The reprinting of copyrighted works is universally prohibited by all walks of life in the world, with few exceptions. Our country's "Copyright Law" also expressly prohibits it. In this regard, the copyrighted works of Chinese and foreign people should enjoy the same treatment. As for American newspapers, magazines, and books occasionally cited by Chinese writers or newspapers, this will not cause the difficulties that the general public worries about, because according to the provisions of the treaty, copyright protection is limited to works that have been legally registered with our official authorities. Those who have not registered in accordance with this procedure are not within the protection of this treaty. Moreover, according to our country's "Copyright Law," occasional excerpts and citations of other people's works for reference and annotation in one's own works are not considered infringement of other people's copyrights. But the most important thing is our reservation on translation rights. Our side made it clear to the US side during the negotiations that due to the differences between the Chinese and American languages, the Chinese translation of American works will not only not hinder the sales of the original works in China, but will sometimes be sufficient to make readers purchase the original works for reference. In order to communicate the culture of the two countries, it is necessary to encourage Chinese translation. The US side expressed sympathy for our view, and agreed to delete the words prohibiting translation in the original draft, and in response to our request, specifically stated in the protocol that if the laws of the method do not give the country's citizens, legal persons, and organizations protection that prohibits translation, then there is no need to give this protection to the other party's citizens, legal persons, and organizations. Since our current "Copyright Law" does not prohibit translation, our people can still translate any copyrighted work published in the United States, without any restrictions from the author.

(6) On the right of citizens of both parties to establish schools - Our country has always attached great importance to the education of overseas Chinese. In the treaties that I have signed with various countries in the past, the right of overseas Chinese to establish schools has often been included in the text of the treaty in order to obtain treaty protection. Article 12 of the Sino-US Commercial Treaty also specifically stipulates that the citizens of both parties may establish schools in each other's territories to educate their children. The only restriction is that this educational undertaking must not be contrary to public morality and must be handled in accordance with relevant local laws and regulations. This is actually necessary for both parties to control foreign schools.

(7) On the treatment of import and export tariffs and sales of goods of both parties - Regarding the import and export tariffs of goods of both parties, Article 16 stipulates that they should enjoy the same treatment as third countries. This is not only in line with our country's current tariff collection methods, but also a common practice in all countries in the world. It has no impact on the principle of tariff autonomy of the contracting parties, because there are no restrictions on matters such as tariff rates and the prohibition and restriction of import and export of goods. Both parties reserve the full right to decide. Therefore, the Sino-US Commercial Treaty does not hinder any tariff policies that our country may adopt in the future. I sincerely hope that the people of the country will pay special attention to this point. As for the sales, distribution, use, etc. of goods after they enter the country, they can only enjoy the same treatment as third countries, and do not enjoy national treatment. Therefore, if it is necessary for our country to give preferential treatment to domestic goods in this regard, it will not be subject to any restrictions in the treaty.

(8) On the scope of navigation of ships of both parties - After the Sino-US Commercial Treaty was signed, the shipping industry was deeply worried that American ships would sail to all ports in our country. In fact, this is an over-concern. Article 21, Paragraph 3 of the treaty clearly stipulates that the ships of one contracting party can only load goods to all ports and territorial waters of the other party that are open to foreign commerce and shipping. Therefore, either contracting party may decide which ports are open and which are not. The right is in its own hands. Foreign ships are not allowed to arbitrarily carry goods into ports that are not open. Therefore, the restriction on the scope of navigation is also a reservation made for the benefit of the country.

(9) Reservations on coastal trade and inland waterway navigation rights - Article 24, Paragraph 2, the provisions on the reservation of coastal trade and inland waterway navigation rights are the same as the text of the exchange of notes of the 1934 Sino-US New Treaty. Some commentators believe that since the reservation of this right has been included in the Sino-US New Treaty, there is no need to repeat it in the commercial treaty. What they do not know is that this time what is being concluded is an entire commercial navigation treaty, so it is customary to include all matters related to coastal trade and inland waterway navigation. Moreover, my side has always insisted on the necessary reservation of coastal trade and inland waterway navigation rights to be enjoyed by domestic citizens, so not only are these rights carefully stipulated, but it is also advocated that the treaty should stipulate that trade between any contracting party and its islands or territories should also be regarded as coastal trade. Under this meaning, the trade between the mainland of our country and Taiwan or Hainan Island can be prohibited from being operated by foreigners.

(10) On the unilateral reservation issues of the United States - Article 26, Paragraph 4 stipulates that the provisions of this contract, in the United States and its territories or dependencies, or the mutual granting in the Panama Canal Zone, or the United States and its territories or dependencies, or the preferential treatment given to Cuba or the Philippines in the Panama Canal Zone, do not apply. Commentators believe that this is a unilateral reservation on the part of the United States and is unfavorable to us. In fact, the United States has this provision in the commercial treaties it has signed with other countries. Because the United States and Cuba and the Philippines have special treaty relations, it is impossible for us to obtain more favorable conditions than any other country. However, the fact that our country's treatment must not be inferior to any other country is clearly stipulated in Article 10 of the Protocol. If the United States gives the aforementioned special preferential treatment to any other country, it should also give it to our country in the same way.

(11) About this Treaty replacing Old Treaties - Article 29, Paragraph 1 of the treaty stipulates that once this treaty comes into effect, it should immediately replace the various clauses of the old treaties between China and the United States that have not yet been abolished. All of these old treaties are the unequal commercial treaties between China and the United States in the past. If there is no conclusion of this new commercial treaty, our country will still be bound by it.

(12) On the effective period of this treaty - Due to the ever-changing nature of international commercial relations, the effective period of the Sino-US Commercial Treaty is only stipulated to be five years. One year before the expiration of the five years, either contracting "party may notify the other party to abolish it. Therefore, at that time, I can decide whether it should continue or be revised depending on how the treaty is implemented.

The meaning of the Most Favored Nation Clause - Finally, I would like to explain the meaning of the Most Favored Nation Clause: The so-called most favored nation treatment is actually equal treatment with third countries. This is the principle that our country has been striving for in diplomacy over the years. Since I do not want overseas Chinese in the United States to suffer treatment lower than that received by the citizens of other countries, then I should not treat American expatriates in China unequally. In the past, the most-favored-nation clause did have its drawbacks. The reason for this was the existence of unequal treaties and the provisions of the unilateral most-favored-nation clause, as well as the absence of certain reserved clauses.

Based on the above explanation, I believe that it will not be difficult for readers to give a correct judgment on the Sino-US Commercial Treaty. Other new treaties that replace old commercial treaties are yet to be concluded. Our government will definitely continue to work cautiously in accordance with the above three guiding principles to live up to the expectations of the people.

### Different Criticisms of the New Commercial Treaty: American Businessmen Believe It Is Beneficial to Us, The US Congress Will Discuss It Tomorrow

[United Press, Washington, 27th] Many Chinese critics of the new Sino-US Commercial Treaty say that it is beneficial to the United States and not beneficial to China. This statement is unacceptable to the American business community. Most American businessmen have the opposite view, saying that this treaty is excessively beneficial to China. For example, copyrights and patents have not been given sufficient attention in the commercial treaty, which American businessmen seeking to do business in China believe is extremely important. Generally speaking, Americans who pay attention to trade with China all say that the purpose of the commercial treaty is to give equal rights to the two countries, but under the current situation in China, it is actually only beneficial to China. The new treaty must be ratified by the governments of both countries before it can come into effect. The US Congress will discuss this treaty after it convenes in early January. It will first be jointly reviewed by the House Committee and then submitted to the Senate for approval. It is expected that this treaty will be passed by Congress and will not be subject to severe opposition.

### The Serious Problem of Smuggling in Hong Kong: The Key to the Success or Failure of Our Revised Trade Measures - A Statement by the Director of the Audit Department of the Central Bank

[Report from Our Newspaper] Mr. Li Lixia, Director of the Audit Department of the Central Bank, accompanied by Mr. Lin Fengbao, Director of the Business Bureau of the same bank, and Mr. Qian Zongqi, Tax Commissioner of the General Tax Inspectorate, flew to Guangdong on the 19th of this month. They made brief stays in both Guangzhou and Hong Kong, conducting detailed investigations into the economic and trade situations in both places, and returned to this city at 6:00 PM the day before yesterday. When our reporter visited to inquire about the trip, Director Li said: "The key to the success or failure of the government's newly promulgated revised import and export trade measures is closely related to resolving the problem of smuggling in Hong Kong. Otherwise, the stricter the implementation of the revised trade measures, the more rampant smuggling in Hong Kong will become. If the smuggling problem is resolved, the problem of capital flight through overseas remittances can also be resolved."

Overseas Remittances Concentrated in Hong Kong

Mr. Li then pointed out three ways to solve the problem of smuggling in Hong Kong: (1) Strengthen the anti-smuggling efforts of the customs; (2) Local authorities, military and police should cooperate in cracking down on smuggling; (3) Obtain the cooperation of the Hong Kong government. Mr. Li said that the coastlines of Guangdong and Fujian provinces are quite long, and the anti-smuggling force of the customs is extremely weak and must be strengthened as much as possible. The cooperation of local authorities is also necessary. The Hong Kong government must actively cooperate; otherwise, passive assistance will only encourage smuggling. He believes that the Hong Kong government can sincerely cooperate because, in the long term, Hong Kong's prosperity is closely related to the rise and fall of the mainland economy.

Overseas Remittances Concentrated in Hong Kong

Regarding overseas remittances to our country: Hong Kong has recently become a transfer point for remittances from Southeast Asia and the Americas, from which they are redistributed to various parts of Guangdong and Fujian. If our country can control the amount of overseas remittances, it will also help implement the revised trade measures. Before the war, the total amount of overseas remittances to our country was about US$130 to 140 million per year. Although remittances from Southeast Asia have decreased since the war, remittances from the Americas have increased dramatically, so the total amount has not decreased. However, most of the internal remittances from Hong Kong are handled by banks in Hong Kong and Guangdong. The banks in Guangzhou are divided into three types: silver firms, foreign exchange, and money shops. A total of 86 have joined the association, but only 11 have been issued licenses by the Ministry of Finance, and only 20 to 30 comply with the regulations of the Ministry of Finance. In addition, there are 15 ordinary commercial banks. This time, a meeting was held with the Guangzhou banking industry, instructing them to cooperate more with the country and instructing them on three points: (1) Remittances in national currency via Hong Kong, which could promote capital flight, should first be approved by the Central Bank; (2) The foreign exchange positions purchased by each bank should be sold to the Central Bank. Currently, banks that have not been designated to operate foreign exchange and banks that have not obtained licenses to operate foreign currency transactions are applying to the Central Bank for permits to obtain legal status.

Market Conditions in Guangdong and Hong Kong

Guangzhou's export figures are not large, but in the future, products such as ramie, tung oil, and raw silk produced in Hunan and Jiangxi will be exported from here. The Guangzhou market is currently quite sluggish, with interest rates lower than those in Shanghai, so large amounts of capital have been transferred to Shanghai. Money has always been tight in Guangzhou's market, and the local financial community hopes that the Central Bank can find a way to stop this.

In contrast, Hong Kong's reconstruction work is progressing smoothly, having completed about 70% of the job. The financial situation is stable, and interest rates are surprisingly low, with no interest on current deposits, 2% on fixed deposits, and only 6% on loans. Prices are also stable, and generally expected to fall. With low interest rates and reduced expenses, many industrialists from Shanghai have gone to inspect, and many are preparing to set up factories there. Price controls are strictly enforced in Hong Kong, and there are price limits on clothing, food, housing, and transportation, which are implemented thoroughly. British woollen piece goods are 30% to 50% cheaper than in Shanghai, while American goods are not as popular as in the Shanghai market. There are 25 Chinese banks in Hong Kong, but most of them cannot develop fully. Although the Hong Kong government does not control foreign exchange on the surface, HSBC often manages it, and overseas remittances are often used for large-scale purposes. The official exchange rate in Hong Kong is HK$4 to US$1, but the black market rate is HK$4.60 per US$1.

Gold Prices in Guangdong and Hong Kong

As for gold prices, both Guangdong and Hong Kong are cheaper than Shanghai, with Guangzhou cheaper than Shanghai by 4% and Hong Kong cheaper by 10%. The price of gold in both places is about 270,000 legal tender per tael, but it is measured using the old weight system. Currently, the daily turnover in Guangzhou is about 10,000 taels or more, mostly smuggled from Hong Kong, with about 3,000 taels arriving daily, it is said.

Lin Fengbao's Statement

According to Mr. Lin Fengbao, he told reporters that the Temporary Import Management Committee, considering the special circumstances of Guangzhou being close to Hong Kong and Macau, and to avoid commercial stagnation due to the promulgation of new regulations, specially sent him and Mr. Qian Zongqi, Tax Commissioner of the General Tax Inspectorate, to Guangdong on the 19th. They repeatedly discussed steps with the local tax commissioners and representatives of designated banks in Guangzhou, and went to Hong Kong to discuss with the tax commissioners of the Yuehai, Kowloon, and Gongbei customs offices. It was decided that a part of the import business there involved purchases from Hong Kong by merchants from Guangzhou, and that not a few were actively shipping goods from Hong Kong to Guangdong for sale. At the same time, tens of thousands of people travel between Hong Kong and Guangdong daily, and there are many small-scale imports. To adapt to the needs of the situation, it was necessary to adopt an expedient measure, and after approval was obtained from the Temporary Import Management Committee, temporary import permits will be issued in Guangzhou and Kowloon by designated banks and customs offices, respectively, based on the type of goods and the quantity limit, until the end of this year. Once the registration of all merchants is completed, they will be transferred to Shanghai for review and issuance. Mr. Lin reported to the committee yesterday evening after his return to Shanghai.

### The Capital is All Silver-White: A Siberian Cold Wave Strikes; Snow Falls Everywhere in the Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River

[Report from Our Newspaper in Nanjing on the 28th] It snowed heavily in Nanjing all day on the 28th, stopping only at night. The weather also turned cold sharply, dropping to 1 degree Celsius at the coldest time. Several refugees in Xiaguan have frozen to death due to the severe cold. Many women, children, and the elderly are on the verge of death, urgently in need of relief. It is reported that it did not snow in Nanjing last winter. This is the first auspicious snow in two years.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] After three days of rain, it began to snow heavily in the capital on the morning of the 28th, becoming heavier at noon. By the evening, the entire city was covered in white. The snow had not stopped by 7:00 PM. This is the first snowfall of the year. It is reported that the cause is a sudden Siberian cold wave that began on the 25th of this month and invaded the country from the northwest from Siberia. On the 27th, it reached the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, causing the temperature in the Nanjing and Shanghai area to drop sharply, falling to around zero degrees this morning. The reason for the snowfall is that the warm air layer over Nanjing collided with the cold air mass, causing the warm air to rise from the low altitude. The moisture in it came into contact with the cold air in the upper layers, quickly condensing into snow and falling (For weather reports on Shanghai, please see page six).

[Report from Our Newspaper in Zhenjiang on the 28th] The weather turned cold suddenly on the 28th. From morning until the time of this report, it was snowing heavily. There were few pedestrians on the roads of Jinshan, Jiaoshan, and Beigushan, and everyone indoors had started fires for warmth.

[Report from Our Newspaper in Wuxi on the 28th] The weather in Wuxi has been warm like autumn since the beginning of winter. Last night, the weather turned cold and it has been raining continuously. At 1:00 PM today, it suddenly began to snow again, and the weather became even colder.

[Central News Agency, Suzhou, 28th] The weather here changed suddenly today, becoming as cold as mid-winter, with continuous rain all day. It began to snow at 10:00 PM.

[Report from Our Newspaper in Hangzhou on the 28th] Winter has arrived, and the first snow fell in Hangzhou today.

[Report from Our Newspaper in Hankou on the 28th] It began to snow heavily here at 6:00 AM this morning, and it has not stopped all day. The wind is biting, and the temperature is more than five degrees lower than last winter. The market is even more sluggish, and the security authorities have ordered their subordinates to strengthen winter defenses.

### Sino-American Agricultural Cooperation Team Suggests Improving Our Rural Areas; Hesheng Submits the Report to Truman

[United Press, Washington, 27th] Dr. Hesheng, Dean of the College of Agriculture of the University of California, today submitted to President Truman a report on the Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Group's improvement of Chinese agriculture, strongly advocating that the National Government of China can alleviate domestic unrest through rural reform. Hesheng then gave a speech to hundreds of officials from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, explaining some of the suggestions he made to the Chinese government. He said that before leaving China, he had sent copies of his report to senior Chinese officials, Ambassador Stuart and Special Envoy Marshall. Hesheng expressed his opinion that if the Chinese government can catch up and implement a strong agricultural plan, the domestic unrest in China can be greatly alleviated, because most of the unrest in China stems from rural areas. He praised Chinese farmers as "good people," but said that there were many areas that needed improvement. Hesheng put forward four special suggestions as follows: (1) Promote the use of improved seeds; (2) Use more chemical fertilizers to replace the currently used organic fertilizers; (3) Expand the use of methods to control pests and plant diseases; (4) Increase irrigation facilities.

Editorial

### A Strong Guarantee for Embarking on the Road to Democracy

—After Reading Chairman Chiang's Speech—

The National Assembly held its third session yesterday. The draft constitution has been solemnly presented by Chairman Chiang himself. As soon as the agenda for discussing the draft constitution is decided, the discussion of the draft constitution will begin. After listening to Chairman Chiang's speech at the National Assembly yesterday, we are even more convinced that the Fifth-Fifth Draft Constitution Amendment will be approved by a majority of the representatives at the National Assembly. There are three key points in Chairman Chiang's speech: (1) The Five-Power Constitution is the newest and most advanced constitution in the world, but the people of our country are not yet able to exercise political power; therefore, the Fifth-Fifth Draft Constitution is impractical and cannot be applied. (2) The spirit of the Five-Power Constitution lies in the division of "power" and "ability." Those in power must exercise the power of governance from the standpoint of the people and think for those who exercise political power; otherwise, it is easy to become a centralized system. (3) The constitution is valuable in its implementation. Regarding the Fifth-Fifth Draft Constitution Amendment, not only is he in favor of it, but he also sincerely hopes that the National Assembly can approve it. Chairman Chiang, as the Director-General of the Kuomintang, which is in power, has such magnanimity of "regarding the world as his own," which is the most powerful guarantee for China to embark on the road to democracy.

Although a small number of Kuomintang representatives have insisted on the essence of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Five-Power Constitution and expressed dissenting opinions on the Fifth-Fifth Draft Constitution Amendment, after Chairman Chiang's repeated and sincere explanations, they will be able to abandon their prejudices, take into account reality, and accept this Fifth-Fifth Draft Constitution Amendment drafted in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, which is almost certain. The Youth Party representatives also announced to the National Assembly yesterday that the party's representatives "will do their best to participate in the discussion and promote the formulation of this modern and perfect constitution needed by the people of the whole country." As for the Democratic Socialist Party, it had already made the passage of this draft constitution amendment a condition for participating in the National Assembly and supporting this draft constitution, which goes without saying. This is also not a problem for the social elite. In addition to this, what remains are only the truly democratically elected representatives. Although they regard the Political Consultative Conference as a party conference and are unwilling to be bound by the resolutions, Chairman Chiang also announced when answering questions from representatives: The National Assembly is not bound by the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. However, democratically elected representatives cannot ignore the domestic reality, especially since democratically elected representatives were elected before the War of Resistance Against Japan, and eight or nine years have passed. Whether they can still represent public opinion seems to be a problem. If we weigh the Fifth-Fifth Draft Constitution and its amendments from the perspective of political science theory, then we must say that the amendments have made considerable progress. Democratically elected representatives have no reason to object.

Chairman Chiang said: "This draft constitution presented today can be said to have been forged by the blood and tears of the military and civilians and martyrs across the country over the past fifty years. Today, I, on behalf of the government, submit this draft constitution. At the same time, I think that after the constitution is formulated in the future, it will be of great importance to the country's governance and the rise and fall of the nation. Therefore, I cannot but speak sincerely. Today, after the National Government submits the draft constitution to the National Assembly, it can be said that the government has handed over the responsibility of the country to the people of the whole country. From today onwards, the people of the whole country will begin to bear this important responsibility." These enthusiastic and heartfelt words are enough to inspire every truly patriotic person and to admire Chairman Chiang's statesmanship, which is unmatched by anyone. Since the National Assembly opened on the 15th, the Chinese Communist Party and the China Democratic League have firmly refused to participate and have tried every means to sabotage it, saying that the National Assembly is a National Assembly monopolized by the Kuomintang and that the government's convening of the National Assembly has completely destroyed the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. However, after seeing the situation of the National Assembly's meeting and listening to Chairman Chiang's speech, we can know that the various claims of the Chinese Communist Party are either false or delusional. The Kuomintang is determined to return power to the people and naturally has no need to monopolize the National Assembly. In order to ensure that the draft constitution amendment is passed by the National Assembly, Chairman Chiang has spent countless words, sincerely explaining to the National Assembly representatives to consider the facts, abandon their prejudices, and accept this military constitution drafted in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. The so-called "facts speak louder than words," and it is self-evident who is destroying the Political Consultative Conference. As for the comments of foreign newspapers on the National Assembly, because foreigners do not understand the actual situation of our country's politics very well, they inevitably miss the point and have no value for debate.

In short, although Chairman Chiang is the Director-General of the Kuomintang, he has the magnanimity of regarding the world as his own and has absolutely no partisan prejudice. This is a strong guarantee for our country to embark on the road to democracy. Under his leadership, the Kuomintang is also brewing a new type of political party, which is to respect each other and tolerate each other. It is expected that the draft constitution amendment will be passed by the National Assembly, which is no longer a problem. This can really be regarded as a sign that our country's political situation will be clear from now on. All the National Assembly representatives attending the meeting should focus on the big picture in the constitution-making work, be able to see the big picture, and ensure that the National Assembly completes its constitution-making work as soon as possible. The 450 million people across the country are looking forward to Nanjing, hoping that the National Assembly's constitution-making will be smooth and have a satisfactory harvest. Since the National Assembly representatives have been entrusted with the important task of the people, they should base everything on public opinion. They should think about Chairman Chiang's speech yesterday again and again and earnestly follow it.

### Our Consul in Haiphong, Zhu Yuanzhang, Escapes from the Dangerous Area; Vietnamese Do Not Guarantee the Lives of Overseas Chinese

[Central News Agency, Haiphong, 27th] Our Consul in Haiphong, Zhu Yuanzhang, was rescued from the Vietnamese on the 26th by French troops. It is reported that the Vietnamese are fighting in the Overseas Chinese area and do not guarantee the lives of Overseas Chinese. The area controlled by the Vietnamese has become an extremely terrifying area. After our Consul in Haiphong left the dangerous area, the French army will launch a full-scale offensive against the Vietnamese. However, the French commander told Central News Agency reporters on the morning of the 26th that he would do his best to prevent further losses to Overseas Chinese. The French army's attack has started at noon on the 26th, but the situation in the French-controlled area on the 26th was excellent. Everything is very calm.

[Associated Press, Hanoi, 26th] (Delayed) French and Vietnamese Republic troops continue to fight in Haiphong and other places. French transport planes parachuted paratroopers to Hanoi today. Officials announced that the situation is under control. According to unconfirmed reports, French planes patrolled Haiphong and used machine guns to sink two Vietnamese arms ships.

### Communist Troops Launch Fierce Attacks on the Su-Huai Highway, Attempting to Threaten Huaiyin; Yan'an Actively Repairs Airfields in Preparation for War

[Report from Our Newspaper in Xuzhou on the 27th] The offensive of the Communist troops in northern Jiangsu is becoming increasingly urgent. The National Army is in a completely defensive position because it is abiding by the ceasefire order. On the border of Huai and Si, more than 50,000 Communist troops crossed the south bank of the Liutang River and launched fierce attacks day and night on strongholds such as Wujiaji and Tangji, which are less than 20 miles north of the Su (Qian) Huai (Yin) Highway, attempting to cut off the transportation line between Huai and Su and threaten Huaiyin. The National Army was forced to fight back and has been fighting bloodily for four days and nights. Both sides have suffered heavy losses, and the fighting is still ongoing.

The Communist Army's Huainan Independent Brigade, with about 7,000 troops, advanced on the area of Luoma Lake, Sanchang, and Longgang, which are 30 miles northeast of Suqian, on the 25th. More than 3,000 Communist troops from southern Shandong launched a fierce attack on Xia Town, on the east bank of Weishan Lake, on the evening of the 25th. After a night of fierce fighting, the Communist troops' offensive was thwarted on the morning of the 26th and they began to flee to Bancun, which is 15 miles to the northeast.

### Piecemeal Repair of the Jiangbei Canal; One Section in the Communist Area Could Not Be Surveyed

[Report from Our Newspaper in Hongyin] The sluice gates and dams along the Jiangbei Canal were mostly destroyed by the enemy and the puppet regime. This time, when the Communist army retreated, they also dug up the embankment and broke the water, harming the people. The entire embankment of the canal needs to be repaired. The Canal Works Bureau is now actively planning to remedy this, and has specially divided the entire project into three sections: Jiangbao, Huaipi, and Yimuweilu, and established engineering offices and organized surveying teams to conduct surveys separately. The Jiangbao section starts from Jiangkou in the south and ends at Huangpu in Bao'ying in the north. Most of it was originally a stone embankment, which is badly broken and needs to be tidied up and repaired urgently. The survey has been completed and work will begin soon. The Huaipi section runs from Huangpu to Siyang and has also been divided into groups to survey the four transport embankment works of Qing'an, Yunkou, Qingjiang, and Pingqiao, which must be completed by the end of the month so that work can begin as soon as possible. However, the Yimuweilu section, which extends north from Siyang to Luguo, bears the waters of the Lu River and has a huge impact on northern Jiangsu. It is currently occupied by the Communist army, and surveying and estimating the land in person is not possible. However, we urgently hope that the embankment can be restored to ensure the safety of the counties along the canal.

Furthermore, the transportation in the recovered areas is not yet smooth, causing some delay in the supply of medicines, so it is not possible to fully meet the demands for widespread medical treatment. However, the department is currently feeling a lack of medical personnel. Many nurses were previously recruited and hired, but they have not yet reported for duty. Once they report, they will be dispatched to various places to serve, so as to extend services to the rural areas of each county where security has been established.

### Handling of Property Seized From Traitors in Various Places: Confiscated Items Should Be Sold Off Regularly

[Report from our Suzhou, 28th] The Ministry of Judicial Administration has issued an order stating that many properties in provinces and cities have been seized from traitors.

However, now that the work of the Enemy Property Management Bureau is coming to an end, there are not many cases where the handling of traitor property has been completed. Therefore, it was previously ordered to organize Traitor Property Management Committees in various provinces and cities, with the chief prosecutors of the high courts in each province and city serving as chairmen, so as to take over the handling of traitor property. Now, in order to unify the steps of handling, the Ministry of Judicial Administration specifically telegraphed the high courts of various places and the traitor property management committees of various provinces and cities to pay attention to several points: (1) In addition to the necessary utensils and movable property for the living of the family members left behind after the confiscation of traitor property, all of their groups should be confiscated; (2) The confiscated traitor property should be sold off at any time, and the funds should be turned over to the national treasury, but the expenses of the confiscation work can be retained according to the actual situation, and a certain amount of money can be retained for the benefit of the judicial organs.

Why Are Streetlights Not Turned Off During the Day?

Editor:

Amidst the calls for energy conservation, and with the personal leadership and exhortation of Mayor Wu, the majority of merchants and residents have complied.

Today, at 9 AM, I happened to look up and see that the streetlights on Jinling Road were still on. I initially thought it was still early and that's why they hadn't been turned off, but to my surprise, they remained on until the evening. I thought of my own store, and out of fear of being penalized, we reduced our lighting, which, of course, has had a noticeable impact on our business. However, this was unavoidable. Could such a massive and useless loss also be saved? (Xu Misheng)

Protest Against the Wild Rise in Public Utility Rates

"Even a clever housewife cannot cook without rice." Under the principle of living within one's means, all undertakings, if prices rise reasonably, should not only not be opposed, but should be enthusiastically supported so that the undertaking has hope for development. This time, the rise in public utility rates, if it doesn't rise, it's nothing, but once it rises, it's shocking, rising beyond reason, making us common citizens have to shout: "We can't take it anymore!"

The bus from Laoximen to Caojiadu was reduced to 300 yuan in the city council, but now it has risen to 600 yuan. The prices at that time were only a few percent higher than now, not doubled, but the fare has doubled, and I don't know what calculation it is based on? It is said that the profits of publicly-run enterprises go to the city treasury, taken from the people and used for the people, this is understandable; but what about the city ferry?

The price from the Floating Restaurant to Gao Temple was one jiao before the war, and now it has risen to 900 yuan (reported to have increased from November 25th, but in reality it has been increased for more than a week. The Han Decree seems to be equal to zero, making us ordinary people confused). It is nearly doubled compared to the cost of living index, and the city ferry has been changed to a joint government-business venture, which is too much to just seek exorbitant profits for businessmen! But let's not dwell on that; let's talk about the trackless trolley.

The trackless trolley from Jing'an Temple to Zhongshan Park was definitely less than three fen before the war, but now it has risen to 300 yuan, which is more than ten thousand times more, and the trolley company is a British company, so they must be shouting to England, wildly making money from us common citizens, how can this be explained?

During the period of occupation in this city, every "fair price" was unreasonable; I can't believe that there is such an unreasonable price increase under the blue sky and white sun. We common citizens are already like startled birds and are somewhat confused. Please give us a reasonable explanation! (Zhang Meimei)

(Editor's note) At the same time, we received a letter from Ji Yongqi, a reader from Longhua, stating: "We are students living in Longhua and have always walked through the wind and rain. This month, on the 18th, we saw that the city bus was already running on this road, so it was very convenient. However, the fare is too unreasonable, a flat rate of 1,000 yuan regardless of distance. This is another major blow! No! The citizens of Longhua also pay all kinds of taxes and fees. Why don't we receive the same treatment in terms of welfare as the urban areas? We hope that the municipal authorities will pay attention to this unreasonable fare and should calculate it based on distance. This is what the citizens of Longhua are asking for." Niu Nong's weeping in Yuyuan Road and Shen Tongjun also have the same voice, so they are published together.

Questioning the Charges for Dredging the River

Yesterday, the Bao Chief of our Bao (Pudong North District) Yun Tai said that the Municipal Government ordered the dredging of the Wangjia Bang river channel, and the cost was to be collected at 5,000 yuan per mu of land, which is really difficult to understand. The Municipal Government's dredging of the river should first start with this small river, which is less than four li long and only three or four zhang wide. If it is related to national defense or an important transportation route, it should be borne jointly by the people of the scholar, industry, commerce, and other fields. If it is related to agricultural water conservancy, then the fundraising should not be limited to one profession, and it should be raised in the river basin to be reasonable. Furthermore, the practice of迎種賽會 is prevalent in the countryside, why not use the spending on引項 to raise the money for dredging the river? Please pay attention to it, Bao Chief! (Huang Futing)

Mr. Zhang only saw the garbage being dumped and did not see the mosquito eradication workers carrying it away for use, so it is understandable that he did not understand the reason." Special reply.

From then until then, the military government will still exercise power, and the British, American, and Yugoslav troops will remain in their current areas of stationing.

In addition, agreements were reached on the most-favored-nation clause regarding Italy's compensation issue, civil aviation, and the possibility of holding an international conference to investigate the free navigation of the Danube. The representatives of the four foreign ministers are scheduled to meet at 4:00 PM today to draft the final draft of yesterday's agreement.

The four foreign ministers themselves are scheduled to continue their discussion at 9:00 PM to discuss two issues: first, the detailed reports submitted by the economic experts on various points of agreement; second, the Danube navigation issue.

### Domestic and Foreign Troops of Various Countries Will Be Investigated Simultaneously, Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly Passes British Proposal, Soviet Union Suffers Triple Defeat

[United Press, Lake Success, 27th] At today's meeting of the Political and Security Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov suffered a triple defeat. First, the committee adopted the Soviet proposal that all United Nations countries publish the number of their troops stationed abroad by January 1 of next year, but amended the proposal so that all countries should simultaneously publish the number of all their domestic military forces. Mr. Molotov tried his best to oppose it, but it was passed in the end. Second, Mr. Molotov's request that the committee adopt Egypt's proposal that British troops stationed in non-enemy countries should be withdrawn immediately in all cases except for special circumstances also failed. Third, Mr. Molotov attempted to force the United States and Britain to publish the number of all their atomic bombs, rockets, and other secret weapons by January 1 of next year, but the committee even refused to submit this proposal for a vote.

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 27th] The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly today passed a British proposal by a vote of 40 to 10, stipulating a general investigation of the foreign troops of various countries in the world. The Soviet Union vehemently opposed it to no avail. The Soviet Union argued that the investigation should be limited to foreign troops, and domestic troops could be involved in future discussions on disarmament. At the same time, the committee rejected the Soviet Union's request to investigate all secret weapons such as atomic bombs and rockets. Earlier, the committee chairman, Ukrainian representative Manuilsky, had twice attempted to submit the Soviet Union's arms investigation proposal, which immediately caused a heated debate. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov also attempted to prevent the British proposal from being put to a vote, wanting to add the phrase "and the military equipment that can be used domestically" to it. The amendment was rejected by a vote of 24 to 18. The United States proposed an amendment to the British proposal, deleting the phrase "the United Nations Security Council dispatches supervisors to review in the field," which the committee passed by a vote. The Soviet Union then proposed that "when the Security Council discusses disarmament issues, each country should report the situation of its domestic troops and military equipment to the Security Council," which the committee again rejected by a vote of 31 to 10. Although the troop investigation proposal still awaits the final vote of the General Assembly, the result of today's committee vote will not be overturned. The committee finally rejected Egypt's provisional motion by a vote of 29 to 13. The Egyptian proposal argued that the General Assembly should notify member states that all those who have troops stationed in the territory of other member states should withdraw immediately, except as provided by the United Nations Charter. The US representative said that this case must be carefully considered, but the Soviet Union expressed its support. The committee then adjourned until Thursday.

### US Willing to Release Army Numbers

[United Press International, Washington, 27th] According to authoritative sources: If the United Nations organization passes a proposal requiring all countries to declare the actual numbers of their domestic and foreign troops, the US Army Department is prepared and extremely willing to release these figures. Official sources pointed out that the number of US Army troops is largely known to the world because the United States practices a democratic system, and military expenditures must be approved by Congress, so the actual number of troops cannot be concealed. For example, the number of US Army personnel will reach 1.3 million by the end of this year, but will decrease to 1.07 million by June 1947. This is well known to the world. Although the number of troops stationed abroad has not been announced, a fairly accurate approximation can be obtained by calculating based on newspaper records.

### Former Japanese Mandated Islands - US Plans Separate Management

Schles declares at the Trusteeship Council

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, New York, 27th] The UN Trusteeship Council held a meeting today. US representative Schles stated that the United States refuses to disarm its land and naval bases in trust territories until the UN organization has established an effective collective security system. However, in order to disarm bases in trust territories, we must create a situation that can guarantee security. In other words, the Military Staff Committee and the Atomic Energy Commission must be able to determine effective methods to control armaments, and at the same time, the Security Council must be able to avoid the general paralysis caused by the exercise of the veto power. In short, the United States intends to independently administer the former Japanese-mandated islands in the Pacific, where there are air and naval bases on each island. At this point, the representative of New Zealand stood up and stated that the draft trusteeship agreement for Samoa, a territory under its trusteeship, proposed by New Zealand, has been proposed by the Soviet Union for amendment. If the Soviet amendment is passed, New Zealand will withdraw the draft trusteeship agreement and, if necessary, continue to control Samoa without the consent of the United Nations organization. According to the amendment proposed by the Soviet Union, it is argued that the strategic areas within the trust territories should be controlled by the Security Council, and the trustee state has no right to designate strategic areas on its own.

### China Suggests Establishing a Committee to Handle International Relief

US Offers Three Specific Methods

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, New York, 27th] The UN Economic and Financial Committee met today to discuss the suggestion made by the Chinese representative, which advocates that after the dissolution of the UNRRA, an international committee should be established to be responsible for distributing relief materials to various countries in need, based entirely on the nature of relief, without regard to political reasons. The US representative also made a suggestion, strongly arguing that a number of countries should be given financial assistance after the UNRRA is dissolved, in order to purchase food from foreign countries. There are three specific methods: (1) The UN General Assembly should ask the Secretariat to send a list of needed relief materials to all member states of the UN Committee; (2) Request each member state to donate relief materials to the best of its ability in the coming year; (3) Invite the member states that donate relief materials to adjust their relief procedures.

### Hunting Season Near in the US - He Yingqin to Hunt Again

[United Press, Charleston, West Virginia, 28th] The West Virginia hunting season will begin on Monday. Preston has been organizing hunting groups. The Chinese military representative to the United Nations, General He Yingqin, and the Deputy Commander of the Chinese Air Force, Mao Bangchu, will each participate in the hunt with an aide.

### Muslim League Accepts British Invitation - Jinnah to Visit London Personally - Congress Party and Sikhs Refuse

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 27th] It is learned that the Muslim League has accepted the invitation of the British government and agreed to send a delegation to London with the Viceroy of India, Wavell, but the Congress Party and the Sikhs have refused. Wavell is scheduled to fly to London on the 30th of this month and is expected to stay for ten days. The Viceroy's affairs will be temporarily taken over by Corrin starting from the first of next month. In addition, it is learned that the Finance Minister of the Indian Interim Government, Liakat Ali Khan (Muslim League), met with Wavell today and informed him that the Muslim League had accepted the invitation of the British government. After leaving, he held a meeting with other leaders of the Muslim League at his residence. Afterwards, according to a spokesman for the Muslim League, Minister Liakat Ali Khan and the Chairman of the Muslim League, Jinnah, have agreed to personally visit London. Nehru of the Congress Party stated that he has submitted a memorandum to the British government explaining the reasons for the rejection. The Congress Party believes that it has fully accepted the British plan, so there is no need for further discussion.

[United Press, New Delhi, 27th] The Congress Party announced that if the London talks unilaterally decide to make concessions to the Muslim League, all ministers of the Congress Party in the Indian Interim Government will resign. The Indian Constituent Assembly was originally scheduled to open on December 9. If it is decided to postpone it, it will be regarded as a new concession, and the Congress Party cannot remain silent. A reporter asked Nehru whether the Congress Party's decision to refuse to participate in the London conference could no longer be changed. Nehru replied that in this ever-changing world, how can there be anything that is immutable?

### Indian Students Lack Discipline - Only Want to See Plays, Not Study

Lucknow University Closed by Government

[Reuters, Lucknow, 27th] The government of the United Provinces of India has ordered the closure of Lucknow University until the school's Standing Committee can restore student discipline. The reason is that the students had launched a movement to demand preferential treatment for students from theaters, which caused disputes, and even some students held demonstrations outside the Secretariat. The government stated that the students' discipline is deteriorating, and they have no regard for the law. They do not know how to study, only how to see plays. For the sake of the students' future, they must be punished, it is said.

### British Navy Completely Withdraws from Alexandria

Two Egyptian Universities Closed

[Reuters, Cairo, 27th] The withdrawal of British troops from Egypt is progressing gradually. The British Navy announced that the Royal Navy has almost completely withdrawn from Alexandria. It is expected that the British Army will soon announce the withdrawal of the Army from Egypt. The work of transferring the British Army Headquarters to the Suez Canal Zone has also made considerable progress. At the same time, due to Egyptian Prime Minister Sedky's obtaining a vote of confidence in the Parliament, it is generally believed that the Anglo-Egyptian treaty will soon be approved. The Egyptian Cabinet will soon send a senior representative, possibly Foreign Minister Hafez, to London to finalize the treaty.

[Reuters, Cairo, 28th] After three consecutive days of student riots, the Egyptian government has ordered the closure of Cairo University and Alexandria's Farouk University until further notice.

### Six US President Liners - Scheduled to Depart from San Francisco

### All Treaties Torn into Waste Paper - Iranian Government Forces Press on Azerbaijan Province - Azerbaijan Constructs Fortifications to Resist

[Agence France-Presse, Tehran, 28th] The Azerbaijan radio station announced that after the Iranian government forces approached the province of Azerbaijan, all agreements concluded between the province and the government were declared invalid. It is reported that the Iranian government ordered its troops this morning to prepare to enter the province of Azerbaijan.

[United Press, Tehran, 28th] According to today's news, the government of Azerbaijan appears to be reaffirming its independence. It is currently building bunkers to prevent the Iranian government from sending troops from Tehran to the province to monitor the elections. Tehran newspapers reported that General Anushi's troops in Azerbaijan are rushing to build defensive fortifications near the provincial border about 65 miles north of Zenjan. Iranian government forces departed from Zenjan yesterday and advanced towards the provincial border.

### Bidault Cabinet Resigns - Communists Nominate Leader Thorez to Succeed as Prime Minister

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 28th] The Bidault Cabinet submitted its resignation today at the opening ceremony of the National Assembly. The Communist Party has nominated Thorez as the successor to the Prime Minister.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 27th] The French Cabinet held a meeting. First, the interim President and Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Bidault read out the Cabinet's letter of resignation, which is planned to be delivered to the Speaker of the National Assembly tomorrow. Then, the Overseas Minister, Moutet, reported on the policies adopted in Vietnam. President Bidault also expressed his approval, and the Cabinet meeting passed it without discussion.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 28th] When the new French National Assembly opened today, the Communist Party formally announced its demand to obtain the post of Prime Minister. The resignation of the Bidault Cabinet is only a formality, because the government often resigns when the new parliament is convened, so it is not an unexpected move. The new government will not take office until the first president of the Fourth Republic is elected in January next year. The Communist Party's opposition to the Bidault Cabinet remaining as a caretaker government has caused quite a stir. Before the opening of the parliament, the Central Committee of the Communist Party decided to take immediate action to nominate party leader Thorez as Prime Minister. The resolution called for the organization of a "democratic coalition government, presided over by the Communist Party, in order to implement national revival, social progress, democratic revival, and French independence." Communist Party Secretary-General Duclos declared that the Communist Party's program aims at reforming industry, reviving agriculture, and controlling foreign trade. Thorez himself emphasized that the biggest problem at present is to increase production and improve the living standards of the masses. People in the parliamentary lounge expressed doubt about the Communist Party's chances of winning a majority in parliament, because the Communist Party only occupies 183 seats out of the 615 seats in the parliament. It goes without saying that other parties will not cooperate with the Communist Party, and even whether the Socialist Party will support it is questionable. However, the mere fact that the Communist Party has nominated its leader to serve as Prime Minister has forced the parliament to split. The biggest goal of the Communist Party in doing so is probably to put the Socialist Party in a dilemma. Most people expect Bidault to win a majority and remain as Prime Minister, and even if the Communist Party opposes it, it may not shake it. It is true that the majority of members of Bidault's Popular Republican Party not only oppose the Communist Party serving as Prime Minister, but even oppose the Communist Party participating in the cabinet. However, it is generally expected that if Bidault is re-elected as Prime Minister, he will naturally recruit the Communist Party into the cabinet. Although the Communist Party is disappointed because it cannot obtain the post of Prime Minister, it seems very likely to accept it.

### US Civil Aeronautics Board to Open Round-the-World Air Routes - Shanghai as Liaison Station - Sino-US Negotiations in Progress

[United Press, Washington, 27th] China seems to have become the key to the United States opening round-the-world aviation. Robertsson, Deputy Director of the US Civil Aeronautics Board, returned here today after inspecting the East. According to his talk, the United States is negotiating with China for reciprocal rights of aerial landing, and the opening of the round-the-world airline depends on these negotiations. Robertson hopes that the line will be opened within April and said that offices are being established in Tokyo, Manila, Shanghai, Sydney, and somewhere in India to oversee the safety matters before the opening of the line.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 27th] Regarding the two round-the-world air routes planned by the US Civil Aeronautics Board, with Shanghai as the liaison station, one is operated by Pan American Airlines and will fly around the world via Shanghai. The other will be jointly operated by two airlines. First, a Trans World Airlines plane will take off from the United States with passengers, pass through Europe, the Middle East, India, to Shanghai, and then a Northwest Airlines plane will fly from Shanghai across the Pacific to the United States.

### Lewis Should Appear in Court - Judge Grants Ten-Day Grace Period, Orders Immediate Cessation of Labor Disputes - Coal Shortage, Wartime Blackout Restrictions Restored

[United Press, Washington, 28th] As the trial of United Mine Workers President Lewis for contempt of court begins, the judge has sternly rebuked him. Based on the current situation, it appears that it will be quite difficult for Lewis to be acquitted of this charge. The Federal Court is on holiday today due to Thanksgiving, but initial contacts between the authorities and Lewis are clearly unfavorable to Lewis's defense.

[United Press, Washington, 27th] As the coal mine strike intensifies and chokes US industry, United Mine Workers President Lewis was tried today by Federal Judge Goldsborough. Goldsborough accused Lewis of defying the injunction and refusing to maintain the current agreement between the miners and the mine owners. The Federal Judge will also rule on whether the court has the right to issue an injunction against the coal mine strike in the next few days. The union's lawyer argued in court that the "Restrictions on Court Injunctions Act" restricts the court from issuing injunctions in labor-management disputes, so the injunction issued by Goldsborough to Lewis cannot take effect. The judge replied that if the "Restrictions on Court Injunctions Act" applies to this case, there may be no need for a jury. The labor unrest has idled 8 million steel, railroad, and river transportation workers. Most cities across the country have restored wartime blackout restrictions. Government economists warned that there may be a food panic in major cities. One economist said that the disaster of a three-month strike is unimaginable. Most schools have extended their Thanksgiving holidays for several days, citing a lack of coal. The school closures are not entirely due to the coal mine strike. For example, in St. Paul, Minnesota, teachers are on strike demanding a raise, so the schools are closed. Students in some areas continue to receive lessons on the radio. National Association of Broadcasters President Miller has notified all radio stations to broadcast daily school programs in areas where schools are closed.

Lewis's Lawyers Argue Strike Was Spontaneous

About 400,000 coal miners are on strike, and 1.9 million workers in coal-using industries are affected. The Department of Agriculture has repeatedly warned that if the strike lasts for only 20 days and railroad transportation is suspended, there is a danger of food shortages in various cities. Residents in eastern regions have no coal to burn, so they have to wear thicker clothes to keep warm. Within a week, 200,000 people in this area will be idle. Most factories, especially steel mills, are gradually reducing work. US Steel Company will announce the closure of some factories next week, and large and small industries are expected to begin shutting down next week. The industrial areas of Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio are the most severely affected. Within a week, there will be 100,000 idle workers; Illinois will also have 100,000 idle workers within ten days. The automotive industry has not been severely affected, but it has also decided to extend the Thanksgiving holiday to next Monday to save coal.

Lewis's Lawyers Argue Strike Was Spontaneous

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 27th] Federal Court Judge Goldsborough has decided to grant Lewis a ten-day grace period to stop the labor unrest. It is also learned that Lewis's "defendant's defense stated that the miners decided to strike because they believed that all conditions were unbearable, and not because they were instigated by union leaders. Lewis did not violate the law, nor did he disregard the law, and the case should be dismissed." After the defense counsel and the prosecutor discussed the matter, the court decided to adjourn the court and resume the trial on the 28th.

### Jewish Terrorist Group - Issues Ceasefire Order

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 28th] The Jewish terrorist group, the Stern Gang, issued a "ceasefire order" to its sabotage squads last night.

### Greek Air Force Deployed - Bombing Northern Rebels

Yugoslavia Strengthens Border Defenses

[Reuters, Athens, 27th] The Greek Air Force today deployed to bomb the rebels near Mount Bajkus in western Macedonia, while the army also increased its forces there, determined to wipe out the rebels entrenched in the villages there.

[United Press, Athens, 26th] The Greek Foreign Ministry announced today that the Yugoslav government has notified the Greek ambassador to Yugoslavia that due to a large number of Greeks seeking to escape the terror in northern Greece, Yugoslavia has increased its troops along the border as a precaution.

### Japanese Prime Minister Expresses Attitude - Says He is Deeply Aware of the Economic Crisis, Hopes for Socialist Party Cooperation - Economic Revival Still Requires US Assistance

[Kaizo Sha, Tokyo, 28th] After being fiercely criticized by the Socialist Party in the Diet today, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida expressed his attitude, saying that the government is deeply aware of the seriousness of Japan's economic crisis and has established a policy centered on economic issues, which is currently being implemented. When it is impossible to implement, he may resort to dissolving the Diet, but there is no such consideration at present. He hopes that the Socialist Party will abandon its attitude of struggling with the government and work together to rebuild Japan through cooperative actions. Please do not force me on the question of my future progress and retreat.

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 27th] Since Japanese Minister of Commerce and Industry Hoshijima recently made a statement to many financial experts, expressing that Japan's economic situation is very optimistic, Prime Minister Yoshida issued a statement to the press yesterday, believing that Japan's economic recovery still requires US assistance, which suddenly diluted the optimistic atmosphere. Observers here commented that Yoshida's statement has another purpose. There are two purposes: (1) To use the fear of communism to induce the United States to increase aid to Japan; (2) To postpone the cleansing of Japanese government agencies.

### Head of Chinese Medical Delegation Talks About Impressions of Inspection in the US

[United Press, Washington, 28th] Xu, Chief of the Medical Department of the Chinese Army, led a medical and pharmaceutical inspection delegation of 100 members of the Army to the United States in August to inspect the medical and pharmaceutical facilities of the US Army. He expressed his views for the first time today, saying that the Chinese Army only has three or four thousand military doctors, but in reality, it needs at least 30,000. This was the need when he left Nanjing, and now it may need more military doctors. He and the delegation members are currently studying the US Army's medical and pharmaceutical institutions and surgical methods and know that its entire organization is quite excellent, but it may not be fully applicable to China's current economic and political situation. He was very impressed by the US Army's and the civilian medical community's efforts to cooperate. China also needs this kind of cooperation, and he hopes to promote it after returning to China. Xu and several delegation members will return to China in February next year, but most of the delegation members will remain in the United States for eight months to continue their inspection.

The trainees are at least 18 years old and at most 32 years old. Before coming to the United States, they had received 30 hours of flight training in Lahore, India.

The documents have been handed over to the Danish Supreme Police Authority today, which will decide whether to investigate them. It is generally accepted that Hitler burned himself to death in a bunker on the eve of the fall of Berlin, but there is a lack of conclusive evidence.

### The Reorganization of the Indian Government (Part 1)

— By Zhou Xiangguang, Our Correspondent in India

(A dispatch from Delhi, India, November 4th) Human peace and national self-determination are the unanimous calls of enlightened nations in the 20th century. Of course, India, with its population of 400 million and its status as an ancient Eastern country, cannot be allowed to remain under foreign rule and should have an autonomous position. Therefore, since the British Labour Party formed a cabinet, it has recognized this point and intends to gradually hand over power to India, enabling it to achieve complete freedom and independence within ten or even five years. This is a truly brilliant policy that will write a glorious page in British colonial history. Thus, in February of this year, the British Labour Cabinet sent the Secretary of State for India, Lord Lawrence, the First Lord of the Admiralty, Alexander, and the President of the Board of Trade, Cripps, to India to negotiate the issue of Indian independence with leaders of various Indian political parties. After several months, a declaration was issued, urging the Congress Party and the Muslim League to jointly form a cabinet.

At that time, both the Congress and the League originally intended to jointly form a provisional central government. However, the Congress Party soon became unwilling to participate and wished to join the Constituent Assembly, while the Muslim League was unable to form a cabinet on its own. Consequently, the matter of the two parties forming a government dissolved into nothing. However, the Labour government felt that the failure of this matter was not a good solution and ordered the Viceroy of India, Wavell, to encourage the Congress Party to form a government alone. The Muslim League felt that the British were selling out the League and convened a Central Executive Meeting, announcing the cancellation of the previous agreement. That is, the Muslim League would neither participate in the government nor join the Constituent Assembly and further decided to hold a "Direct Action Day" on August 16th to demonstrate and resist the Congress Party.

Indeed, from August 16th to 19th, the tragedy of the Calcutta massacre occurred. The total number of deaths and injuries among Hindus and Muslims reached over 15,000, a major catastrophe in history. At that time, the reporter was still in Calcutta and witnessed the scene. Even the old, weak, women, and children could not escape being hacked to death with sharp axes, making one's heart ache. Since then, a low pressure in the Indian political situation has spread to every corner of India. People, both Chinese and foreign, witnessing the once infinitely bright Indian independence movement suddenly overshadowed by an unexpected darkness, were filled with regret and utter depression. Until September 2nd, the President of the Congress Party, Nehru, unable to obtain the Muslim League's consent to jointly form a cabinet, proceeded to form a government on his own, striving for India's independence and freedom. The Muslim League believed that Nehru's actions were a manifestation of Hindu imperialism, seeking to place 100 million Muslims under Hindu rule. To express their resistance, they instructed all Indian Muslims to hang black flags on the day the new government was established to show that this day was the darkest day in Indian history. However, Nehru ultimately formed the new government.

In several provinces of British India, the cabinets were controlled by the Muslim League, and unrest continued to occur in places such as Bombay and Dhaka. Although the central government was established, its authority did not extend to the local level. To ensure domestic security and cooperation between the two parties, the Muslim League had to participate in the government to have power. In early October, the Viceroy of India, Wavell, invited the leader of the Muslim League, Jinnah, to Delhi for negotiations. Indeed, Jinnah also arrived here from Bombay by ship with his daughter in early October, and an atmosphere of peace once again permeated all parts of India.

After Jinnah arrived in Delhi, he met with Viceroy Wavell four times. Subsequently, the Viceroy flew to other places for inspection. The Indian negotiation issue was then mediated by the Maharaja of Patiala. The Maharaja of Patiala was the chairman of the Chamber of Princes of India and also a Muslim. Therefore, he had easy access to both the Indian and Muslim sides. After several rounds of mediation, lasting a week, from morning to night, without rest, negotiations ultimately failed. One reason was Jinnah's demand for "Pakistan" (Editor's Note: meaning the partition of India and Pakistan), and the other was the Muslim League's insistence on representing all Muslims. The Congress Party believed that both of these points were unacceptable. Establishing Pakistan would be equivalent to dividing India into two countries. Based on the recent general election, the Muslim League representatives were not all elected, and some Muslims belonging to the Congress Party were elected. Therefore, it was believed that the Muslim League had no right to represent all Muslims. On October 11th, the negotiations between the two parties completely failed.

By October 13th, Jinnah, seeing that the negotiations between the two parties had failed, went to Wavell himself to explain that negotiations did not have to go through an agreement between the two parties and that the Muslim League could still nominate five representatives to participate in the provisional central government. After Jinnah returned to his residence, he convened an executive committee meeting to discuss the matter. This time, the Muslim League resolutely joined the new government. According to a commentary in the Calcutta "Star of India" (a Muslim League newspaper), "The Muslim League may not want any agreement with the Congress Party and will decide to join the new government on its own. In this way, the Muslim League does not have to sacrifice its fundamental demands and claims and does not have to recognize the demands of the Congress Party. This approach is beneficial to the Muslim League and can limit the dictatorship of Patel (the current Minister of Home Affairs and Minister of Information) in the new government. It may be able to stop the inspection of letters from Muslim League leaders, preventing the struggle of the Muslim nation to fight for Pakistan from being hindered."

The Calcutta Hindu newspaper "Hindustan Standard" made the following comment on the Muslim League's decision to participate in the new government without consulting with the Congress Party: "Hindus account for 75% of the Indian population. According to the allocation of seats in the new government, among the six seats obtained by the Congress Party, one is for a Muslim and one is for a member of the scheduled castes, while the remaining four seats are for Hindus. However, Muslims account for only 25% of the total population of India, and the Muslim League's Muslim representatives occupy five seats. Adding the six non-Muslim League Muslim representatives in the Congress Party's quota, Muslims actually get six seats. This is inevitably unfair to the Hindu majority, but it still cannot satisfy the Muslim League. It is known that although the negotiations failed, the Muslim League still decided to join the cabinet to enjoy its benefits. Is there any motive? It is unknown. Does the Muslim League want to go in and disrupt things, create a stalemate, and obstruct the good policies that the Congress Party intends to implement? Is it conspiring to encourage the Governor-General to intervene, making the world believe that Britain has not handed over power to the Indians during the transition period? The Muslim League probably hopes to rely on the power of the Churchill group and reactionary British forces in India to obstruct India's progress towards freedom."

The Muslim leader of the Northwest Frontier Province of India, Ghaffar Khan, although a Muslim, followed Gandhi all his life. Therefore, Indians call him the Frontier Gandhi to show their respect. He believed that the Muslim League's participation in the government was a trap by Governor-General Wavell. He said: "It is regrettable that the Muslim League leaders did not reach a solution with the Congress Party but instead privately resolved the matter with the Governor-General. The Governor-General realized that the Congress Party representatives in the new government were acting in unison, and the Governor-General seemed to be in a difficult situation. Therefore, he naturally turned to his old friend, the Muslim League, to rescue him."

### Four Points in the Proposal for Improving China's Agriculture Presented to Truman by Hutchison

[Central News Agency, Washington, 27th Associated Press] Hutchison, Dean of the College of Agriculture at the University of California, recently submitted a proposal to Truman from the agricultural delegation that went to China to improve Chinese agriculture. Later, when he spoke to officials from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, he also mentioned the contents of the proposal. It is said that before leaving China, he submitted several reports to several senior Chinese officials, Ambassador Stuart, and Marshall. He stated that if the Chinese government can actively revitalize and implement a strong agricultural plan, then most of the unrest in the country will gradually calm down, as the unrest in China mostly comes from rural areas. Hutchison greatly praised the goodness of Chinese farmers, but said that they still need to improve in many ways. He especially suggested four points: (1) expand the application of improved crop varieties; (2) use chemical fertilizers in large quantities and reduce the use of current organic fertilizers; (3) find ways to prevent pests and plant and animal diseases; and (4) develop irrigation. He finally said that China needs to promote its education, and its current agricultural education base is backward, so it is not enough to meet the needs of a large number of people. It also said that the delegation suggested that the national government should curb the rapid increase in population. He went on to say that, according to Chinese business giants, China's current resources are sufficient to support the lives of more than 200 million people. He believes that unless China changes this concept through education, it will continue to suffer.

### New Taxes Increase, Disputes Increase Daily, Urgent Need to Evaluate Various Disputes and Improve Collection Procedures, Tax Review Council to Convene a Meeting

[Reported by this newspaper] In order to implement simplified tax collection procedures, the City Government established a Tax Review Council under the Finance Bureau. The organization of the council was recently approved by the Municipal Council. The council consists of one representative from the City Government, the Director or Deputy Director of the Finance Bureau, one representative from the Social Affairs Bureau, the chief of the tax department of the Finance Bureau, one representative from the City Chamber of Commerce, two representatives from relevant trade associations, one representative from the Municipal Council, and one designated accountant. Now, the Finance Bureau, in view of the increase in new taxes, especially the increasing number of disputes over the Municipal Construction Donation and Housing Donation, needs to convene a review council. It recently sent letters to the relevant agencies and groups, requesting them to quickly nominate representatives to the council for discussion. It is learned that the scope of the council meeting is as follows: (1) Evaluate whether taxpayers should be exempted from taxes; (2) Evaluate the business capital of taxpayers; (3) Evaluate the total business income of taxpayers; (4) Evaluate the amount of tax payable by taxpayers; (5) Evaluate various disputes regarding taxes; (6) Evaluate cases involving various tax regulations that should be transferred to the court; (7) Suggest improvements to tax collection procedures; (8) Other matters that may be submitted for review or examination in accordance with various tax regulations.

If Dissatisfied, Reconsideration May Be Requested

The interim regulations also stipulate in Article 3: The tax authority or the taxpayer may, except in the case of the above-mentioned Article 6, if they are dissatisfied with the evaluation event, state the reasons and provide evidence to request reconsideration. If they are still dissatisfied after the reconsideration evaluation, they may submit it to the Municipal Government for approval. Article 6: Members of this council should recuse themselves from attending evaluation events related to themselves, otherwise the evaluation shall be invalid. Article 7: The meeting of this council must have a quorum of more than half of the members present to be held, and the decision shall be made by a majority vote of the members present at the meeting. The presiding officer shall decide in the case of a tie. (The presiding officer shall be the Director or Deputy Director of the Finance Bureau.) Article 10. When necessary, the council may notify taxpayers to attend the meeting for inquiries and may review their account books and related documents.

### City Tax Increase This Month, More Than 3 Billion Yuan More Than Last Month, Slaughter Tax Also Adjusted Starting Next Month

[Reported by this newspaper] The city Finance Bureau's tax revenue for this month, as of yesterday, has reached 11 billion yuan in legal tender, an increase of 3 billion yuan compared to the entire previous month. This is due to the levy of the Municipal Construction Donation and the increase in Feast Tax and Entertainment Tax.

Due to rising prices, the Slaughter Tax will be adjusted starting in December. The new price is as follows: 10,000 yuan per head of cattle (old tax was 9,100 yuan), 8,000 yuan per pig (old tax was 5,600 yuan). It has been filed by the Municipal Council and approved by the Municipal Government. The Slaughter Tax was originally levied at 5% of the price. Since the price of meat changes frequently, it is calculated based on the lowest wholesale price and adjusted once every considerable period. Recently, the price of meat has been rising continuously, and the amount of Slaughter Tax should also be increased. Hu Youyuan, Deputy Director of the Finance Bureau, told reporters that the tax standard set this time is still lower than the lowest wholesale price.

The Autumn Municipal Construction Donation has been progressing vigorously since its levy, and the revenue collected next month is expected to be higher, estimated to reach 3 billion yuan. As for the Winter Municipal Construction Donation, it may be postponed until the beginning of next year. All Municipal Construction Donations are separated from the City Government's other tax revenues and are used purely for municipal construction.

Government Agencies and Schools Must Pay Housing Donation

Government agencies, registered schools, and purely charitable organizations are usually exempt from Housing Donation for the buildings they use. When the Municipal Council passed the Municipal Construction Donation, there was a clause that "unless otherwise provided by law, there shall be no exemption." Regarding this point, the Municipal Government and the Finance Bureau recently sent a letter to the Finance Group of the Municipal Council. According to the reply, "the decision is still not to exempt." Therefore, the buildings of the above-mentioned three agencies and organizations must also pay the Municipal Construction Donation uniformly.

### Article 14 of the Detailed Rules for Business Tax, the City Chamber of Commerce Requests Appropriate Amendments

The City Chamber of Commerce believes that Article 14 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of Business Tax lacks the advantages of flexibility and has telegraphed the Ministry of Finance requesting appropriate amendments so that taxes can be levied according to industry and grade. The original telegram stated: "Article 14 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of Business Tax states that 'other industries shall uniformly levy 1.5% of their total business income.' This fails to take into account the advantages of flexibility in Article 4 of the Business Tax Law, firmly upholding the established case of uniform tax rates. This is beyond the expectations of general industry and commerce and causes widespread disappointment. According to what the association has learned, local tax authorities also deeply believe that it is most reasonable to levy Business Tax according to industry and grade. However, due to the restrictions of Article 14 of the Detailed Rules for Implementation, it is impossible to handle. Therefore, we do not dare to be presumptuous and earnestly request your ministry to review and approve the amendment of Article 14 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of Business Tax, with reference to the pre-war established cases and the current requests of various industries, so as to achieve the effect of promoting benefits."

### Thai Ambassador to China, Dula Raleuk, Arrives in Shanghai

Yesterday was the anniversary of Panama's National Day. The Panamanian Embassy in Shanghai held a reception at the embassy on Hongqiao Road from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM to entertain Chinese and foreign envoys.

### Chen Qicai, Xu Enzeng, and Others Registered as Party Members Yesterday

### Tao Xingzhi Public Funeral in Nanjing, Preparations for Memorial Service by All Sectors

Tao Xingzhi's coffin will be publicly buried in Nanjing. It is reported that many people from the Shanghai cultural circles, such as Tian Han and Hong Shen, will hold a memorial service in Shanghai and then escort the coffin to Beijing to participate in the public funeral ceremony. On the Shanghai side, the original designated host, Shen Hengshan, could not return in time from Beijing, so Huang Renzhi was changed to preside over the service at the North Railway Station, and Wang Shaoyu presided over the service at the Ningbo Guild Hall. On the Nanjing side, the farmers in Xiaozhuang and the surrounding areas, feeling deeply grateful for Tao's deep love and care for them during his lifetime, are now arranging a roadside memorial service.

### Employee Meals and Accommodation, Exempt from Remuneration Income Tax, Cash Payments Still Subject to Tax

The City Chamber of Commerce, based on the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance handling the way to pay the income tax on the amount of salary and remuneration in the second category B, specially forwarded a letter to the members of the association and the member stores for information. The letter roughly stated: "The letter from the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance dated the 23rd of this month, Hu Zhi Er Zi No. 5067, stated: According to the Ministry of Finance's telex of November 14, 35th year of the Republic of China, Jing Zhi Yi (35) Zi No. 10371, it is found that the provision of meals and accommodation for employees by agencies, legal entities, or companies is a type of allowance, and there is nothing wrong with including it in the salary and allowance to calculate the income tax on salary and remuneration in the second category B. However, this type of allowance, in terms of accommodation, is mostly a surplus of public housing, and in terms of meals, the number of meals provided per day varies, so it is appropriate to say that it is a benefit and preferential treatment for employees, but it is not appropriate to call it a fixed allowance, and the calculation is also difficult. For the convenience of tax collection, it is stipulated that in the future, agencies, legal entities, or companies shall not include the provision of meals and accommodation for employees when calculating the income tax on salary and remuneration in the first category B, but cash payments in the form of allowances shall still be combined for taxation. We hope you will inform your subordinates accordingly."

### Key Points of Household Registration Laws and Regulations

[Reported by this newspaper] The city's household registration has been implemented since September 17, and the city government has been handling it very seriously. Recently, it has been conducting extensive publicity, hoping that citizens will understand the household registration laws and register in accordance with the law to obtain guarantees. Household registration includes four types: (1) Registration of Origin - Registration of the establishment or removal of a person's origin. The origin is based on the province and the county to which it belongs. Origin is divided into two types: native origin and domicile origin. A person may establish both a native origin and a domicile origin, but a person may not have two native origins or domicile origins at the same time. (2) Registration of Identity - Registration of various matters related to a person's identity. Currently, the seven types that have been started are birth, adoption, recognition, marriage, divorce, death, and death declaration. (3) Migration Registration - Two types of registration: moving in and moving out. (4) Registration of Floating Population - Registration of the population that has resided for less than one month and whose mobility is irregular.

All applications for household registration shall be made within 15 days after the occurrence or confirmation of the event, but registration of moving out shall be made in advance, and registration of the floating population shall be made on the same day. In addition to the registration of the floating population, which can be verbally applied directly to the Bao Office, the remaining applications shall be obtained from the Jia Head, filled out, and submitted to the Jia Head for verification and transfer.

### Mayor Inspects Jiangwan Down the Countryside, Visits the People's Livelihood and Meets with the Garrison

[Special Feature from this Newspaper] A cold wind overnight, I don't know how many yellow leaves have fallen; the ladies of the city are the most sensitive, and have already shrunk their heads into heavy furs.

Jiangwan, a northern suburb more than ten kilometers away from here, borders the Huangpu River and has a sparse population. Severe winter in Jiangwan will be an even deeper threat. Fortunately, on the first day of the early cold this winter, Mayor Wu brought them warmth.

Mayor Wu went to Jiangwan yesterday morning at 8:00 AM to inspect the 21st and 22nd districts on Qimei Road and Kuizhao Road. The places he visited included: rice shops, meat shops, barber shops, cotton shops, hardware stores, blacksmith shops, bicycle shops, cigarette paper and match shops, tea houses, etc. When Mayor Wu checked the rice shop, he asked: "How much does a dan of rice cost?" When he checked the meat shop, he asked: "How much does a jin of pork cost?" In addition, detailed inquiries were made about how much it costs to get a haircut, how much profit can be made from a batch of cotton, and how much monthly salary an apprentice in a iron shop receives.

### Not Knowing What the Mayor Looks Like, Squinting Their Old Eyes to Take a Look

Most people in the countryside do not recognize Mayor Wu, but they have all heard of the mayor, and at least they know what a "mayor" is. When an old woman in a tea shop discovered "the mayor," she squinted her old eyes and looked all over Mayor Wu, as if she must dig out something different.

"Is that the mayor?" "Is he the biggest in the whole city?" Many villagers said in unison.

Mayor Wu said that he loves the people in the countryside because only they are simple and honest. He loves the children in the countryside even more.

When Mayor Wu stepped into a bicycle shop in Jiangwan Town, the boss was out, and the shop was guarded by a village child. Mayor Wu stroked his head and asked:

"Little brother, what's your name?"

"Monk!"

Everyone was amused by this strange name. He said seriously:

"My name is Monk, that's what the master calls me."

"How old are you this year?"

"Twelve years old"—

"Is business good?"

"So-so."

The twelve-year-old child was so nonchalant and mature, everyone laughed again.

Afterwards, District Chief Li Chengtang told Mayor Wu that the most difficult thing for the rural district office was the lack of cooperation between the military and the people. There were many troops stationed in the rural areas, and soldiers occupied residents' houses. The residents filed complaints with the district office every day. It is said that some troops often put a piece of paper on the door of the residents' houses, or even just write a few words with chalk, and they can forcibly move in. In addition, there are countless cases of borrowing beds, borrowing tables and chairs. Just yesterday, there was still a large pile of complaints from the people on the desk of the district office. The district office really felt powerless about this situation because they did not have this power.

### Magnificent and Grand Construction: A Postscript to Zhang Daqian's Art Exhibition - The Chinese Painting Gallery is Packed with Visitors, Eliciting Sounds of Astonishment and Praise Everywhere

[Special Report from This Newspaper] Zhang Daqian's art exhibition has concluded. The exhibition only lasted four short days, but its success was universally acknowledged. The Chinese Painting Gallery was packed with visitors, and sounds of astonishment and praise could be heard everywhere.

Zhang's paintings have reached the stage of "doing as he pleases, without overstepping the bounds." His landscapes are naturally vigorous and well-rounded, unmatched by any contemporary; his flower paintings also demonstrate supreme skill—the meticulous outlines are delicate and precise, and the "Ink Lotus" centerpiece is particularly magnificent and grand. I believe that one can see the artist's mastery of "still as a virgin, swift as a fleeing rabbit" in Zhang's flower paintings.

Directly Entering the Hall of Ancient Masters

However, Zhang's figure paintings are undoubtedly the most eye-catching. Zhang has been immersed in studying Dunhuang's precious paintings for many years, so it's no wonder he directly entered the hall of ancient masters. Just take a close look at the faces of Zhang's beauties, the folds of the clothing in his Buddhist images, and the kind of style in his portraits that makes you feel as if "their hair and beards are moving"—you can see the influence of Dunhuang on him.

Looking at Zhang's paintings with the eye of Western painting, one will immediately notice that the proportions of the limbs and torsos in Zhang's figures are relatively realistic, quite different from the slender shoulders and wasp waists of beauties in ordinary Chinese paintings, whose bodies are often deformed. In addition, I think the postures and facial expressions of Zhang's figures are also noteworthy: the figures under Zhang's brush seem to have flesh and blood; while the expressions of the figures in traditional Chinese paintings always remind us of the paintings of monks in medieval Europe. Zhang's studies from the Dunhuang murals indeed easily make us think of the classical movement of the Italian Renaissance. The masters of the Renaissance learned from the ancients, but completed entirely new techniques, thus achieving the most precious achievements in art history. I believe that if the art of Dunhuang can be widely disseminated, the result will certainly set off a magnificent wave in the history of modern Chinese art. Moreover, the impact may not be limited to painting alone—I think our literature, especially novels and epics, will certainly gain a richer and more fulfilling life because of this "new" blood.

Dedicated to Dunhuang Murals

Zhang Daqian is a person who is working hard in this direction. When I asked him when he would go to Dunhuang again, he stroked his mottled black and white beard and said excitedly that he would definitely go by the spring of next year at the latest. He has already copied about 120 mural paintings in Dunhuang (mostly works from the High Tang Dynasty), of which more than 80 have been completed, and the lines of about 40 more have not yet been drawn. Among these 120-plus paintings, the size of each corresponds to the original mural. The largest ones would probably require four or five rooms to accommodate. The lines are mostly first drawn precisely using tracing paper, and then redrawn on cloth. Of course, after so many years, the original colors on the murals will naturally inevitably peel off or fade. Zhang strives to restore the original colors in his copying. He has indeed spent a lot of effort in this "reconstruction" work.

He told me that the weather in Dunhuang is particularly dry, with no rain and very little snow. These things in the mountains have been preserved quite well thanks to the blessings of heaven. Ropes left in the caves thousands of years ago, originally used as railings to protect the murals, are still quite strong and won't break even when pulled by hand.

A Bewitching Demoness

I paid close attention to his painting "Bewitching Demoness" in the exhibition. The painting is about three feet high and depicts the Buddha in the middle, sitting solemnly. In front of him are three naked women using different poses to "bewitch" the Buddha. This subject matter is not particularly new, but I guessed at the time that it must have come from Dunhuang, because the lines of the three naked women are simply so accurate that they are close to the sketches in Western paintings, and are very different from the beauties under the brush of traditional Chinese painters. Later, I asked Zhang about the source of this painting. Sure enough, Zhang said that it was taken from a small part of a Tang painting he had copied. However, when it came to the Western influence in the Dunhuang murals, he flatly denied it. His point was that when Buddhism first came to China, it could be preached to the intellectual class through words or language, but to the lower-level ignorant men and women, it could only rely on pictures. And to preach, one must not be too shocking to the world, so even though it was clearly the Buddha of India, Chinese painters had to be asked to paint him in the image of a Chinese person. As for naked women, our country originally had them. There are many erotic and beautiful murals in Han tombs, so the presence of naked women in Dunhuang paintings does not necessarily prove that they were influenced by foreign countries.

However, even though Zhang said this, the question is probably still a question. Mr. Xiang Da, who is well-versed in the history of Sino-foreign exchanges, believes that Western influence is inevitable, because according to his research, Dunhuang was indeed a transportation hub for Sino-foreign exchanges in ancient times. Because of the mix of people from all directions, foreign influence in artistic works was unavoidable.

Both Xiang and Zhang stayed in Dunhuang for quite some time. Because of their different views, they have been arguing for quite some time. After they meet in Dunhuang next spring, will they continue to argue?

### Visiting Brigade Commander Comrade Xiao to Discuss Military-Civilian Harmony

Mayor Wu is most concerned about the people's livelihood. He immediately wanted to meet Brigade Commander Xiao Zhaogeng of the 2nd Brigade of the 202nd Division of the Youth Army, which is now stationed in Jiangwan, to discuss a proper solution.

Brigade Commander Xiao respectfully received Mayor Wu. After a brief exchange of greetings, he expressed disbelief that such a thing would happen. However, because they had just moved to Jiangwan, there were bound to be many things that were not on track and needed to be gradually corrected.

Director Zhang Xiaosong of the Civil Affairs Department offered a good solution. Director Zhang and Brigade Commander Xiao were originally classmates in the sixth term of the Whampoa Military Academy. He said: The Youth Army can send a few political workers to maintain regular contact with the district office! This can eliminate the separation between the military and civilians and prevent the occurrence of violations in the future. This is a good idea and was quickly accepted by the other party. Mayor Wu happily returned to the city government.

If Mayor Wu's inspection has played a role, Director Zhang's suggestions will be earnestly implemented, and military occupation of civilian houses will disappear completely in the future. Then, Jiangwan will have no winter, and the people of Jiangwan will always be warm.

### Powell's Legs Are Both Crippled

[Report from This Newspaper] J.H. Powell, the publisher of the English-language "Millard's Review," testified at the International Military Tribunal for the Far East in Japan. After this, he suffered from heart problems and went to the United States for treatment. Unfortunately, his foot injury worsened. He had to have his right foot amputated on the 26th of this month, and his left foot cannot be preserved either. It will also have to be removed soon. Powell did not want to evacuate when the Pacific War broke out and was detained by the Japanese army in the Qiaotou Mansion concentration camp. Due to being severely abused, his legs were injured. After the victory, his toes had already been amputated, and now both legs are crippled.

### Low Credit of Negotiable Instruments Leads to Increasing Number of Bounced Checks - Banking Association Drafts Measures to Crack Down

Recently, the number of bounced checks has been increasing in the mutual acceptance of negotiable instruments between the banking and money industries. An investigation of the bounced check records of the check exchange over the past year shows that both the number and amount of bounced checks have been increasing month by month. The number has increased by about 17 times, and the amount has increased by as much as 90 times, indicating that the credit of negotiable instruments is declining. This not only wastes manpower and material resources, but also has a significant impact on social finance. The Banking Association has drafted measures to crack down, as follows: 1. In addition to those who are already familiar, a client opening a checking account with a bank should have a guarantor approved by the bank. 2. If a client draws a check exceeding the deposit or overdraft limit, and the paying bank bounces the check, the paying bank should stamp the original check with a "Insufficient Funds" or "Overdraft Exceeded" stamp (the stamp should indicate the date) and issue a written warning. If the warning is ineffective and bounced checks continue to occur, and the bouncing bank believes that the client is intentionally doing so after three or more consecutive bounced checks, the account should be immediately suspended. At the same time, the account name, name, address, etc. should be reported to the association and sent to other associations for verification. 3. If a receiving bank discovers a client that meets the circumstances of the preceding article, it may also report it to the association for verification. 4. If a bank fails to implement the provisions of these measures effectively, resulting in an impact on the crackdown on bounced checks, the Banking Association, the Commercial Association, etc. will each impose sanctions.

### Zhuang Zhiguo Accompanied by Dancer Dong Ai'e: Smiling in Court - Boss of Henry's Accused of Adultery - Zhuang's Wife Liu Huiling Glared - Eloquently Stated the Evidence of the Defendant's Crime - Persuaded to Reconcile, but Refused to Give Up

[Report from This Newspaper] Zhuang Zhiguo, 23 years old, the boss of Henry's Watch Shop on Nanjing Road, had an affair with dancer Dong Ai'e (also known as Deng Senyun) in January of this year and cohabited with her in the Dahua Apartment. His wife, Liu Huiling, discovered the affair and was consumed by jealousy. She filed a lawsuit accusing Zhuang Zhiguo of adultery and Dong Ai'e of interfering with the family. Later, after mediation, an agreement was reached, Zhuang agreed to break off relations with Dong, and Liu Huiling withdrew the lawsuit. However, on September 30, Zhuang's wife discovered that her husband was still continuing to associate with Dong, and her jealousy intensified. She reported it to the police station, and Zhuang and Dong were detained and transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office. The prosecutor prosecuted them for interfering with the family. The case was tried yesterday in the Fourth Criminal Court of the District Court. Dong Ai'e appeared in court in a black leather coat and high-heeled leather shoes, still in the "dancer" style. Zhuang's wife wore a leopard-print coat and glared at Dong, still unable to contain her anger. Zhuang was smiling and at ease, as if he didn't know he was in court. Zhuang and Dong both denied continuing to have an affair, saying that they were just friends. Liu Huiling eloquently stated the evidence of Zhuang and Dong's adultery for half an hour. The court advised them to try to reconcile, but Zhuang's wife said that she had endured enough and asked the court to severely punish the defendants. After the lawyers for both sides argued, the court ordered a retrial at a later date, and the defendants were still released on bail.

### Anesthesia Case Coming to an End - The U.S. Side Orally Declares No Intention to Take Back - Guarantees that Similar Incidents Will Not Happen Again

[Report from This Newspaper] The blood plasma case and the anesthesia case are coming to an end. It is reported that the U.S. Surplus Property Disposal Committee's response to the Chengxin Trading Company's suggestion was an oral declaration that it did not intend to take back the anesthetic drugs and surgical instruments, and guaranteed that similar blood plasma incidents would not happen again. As for the compensation for the blood plasma taken back, the U.S. side is still searching for it.

[Another Report] All 2,704 cases of blood plasma have been returned to the U.S. Surplus Property Disposal Committee by the Chengxin Company and transferred to the U.S. Navy for temporary storage. They are currently stored in the U.S. Navy warehouse. To be cautious about this exchange procedure, the Chengxin Company and the U.S. Surplus Property Disposal Committee have a list of goods, which was given to the Chengxin Company the day before yesterday. Roger, the person in charge of the U.S. side, went to Okinawa Island yesterday to inspect the surplus materials there, so the final development of the blood plasma case is still pending Roger's return before it can be concluded.

### Fourth Day of Fire Prevention Publicity - Visiting Various Municipal Elementary Schools

### Ships Without Permits Are Not Allowed to Carry Passengers - Customs Port Affairs Section Issues Notice

[Report from This Newspaper] There are original regulations for ships carrying passengers. Ships without passenger seats are not allowed to carry passengers, that is, passenger ships are also restricted. Ships carrying passengers must register with the Customs Port Affairs Bureau in advance, and can only carry passengers after a certificate is issued. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Port Affairs Section slightly relaxed the restrictions due to special circumstances. Since the victory, the condition of ships has gradually recovered, and the Customs Port Affairs Section has strengthened its rectification. Port Director Yuan Jin recently issued a notice saying: "(omitted above) From now on, all ships that have not been issued passenger certificates by the competent authorities are not allowed to carry passengers without authorization. If there is any deliberate violation, once discovered, it will be severely punished, or even the ship will be detained. As for ships that have already obtained such certificates, if the number of passengers carried exceeds the quota, in addition to a heavy fine, the certificate may be revoked depending on the circumstances."

### Stealing a Gold Bracelet to Pay Off Debt - A Maid Detained

[Report from This Newspaper] Zhang Zhiyuan, 46 years old, a Zhejiang native living at No. 517, Anqing Road, discovered at 9:00 AM on the 25th that two gold bracelets weighing 1.9 taels had been stolen from the cabinet in his room. He reported it to the North Station Police Branch for investigation. Section Chief Ding sent Officer Bao Qifa and police officers to investigate.

### British Trade Delegation to China Leaves Shanghai for Taiwan Today: Sir Paulson Reports to Reporters Before Departure and Expresses Optimism About the Future of Chinese Industry and Commerce

[Our Newspaper's Report] The British Trade Delegation to China, led by Sir Paulson, comprising more than ten people, arrived in China on October 7th to investigate commerce and Sino-British trade. They visited Nanjing, Beiping, Tianjin, Hankou, and other places. Sir Paulson and his party left Beijing the night before after bidding farewell to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and came to Shanghai. Today, they will depart for Taiwan, stay in Guangzhou for a few days, and then return to England via Hong Kong. At 5:00 PM yesterday, Sir Paulson specially hosted reporters at the Qunmao Hotel, briefly outlining his observations from this investigation.

Sir Paulson stated: This investigation in China, touring various places, yielded a great deal of information. However, it must be fully organized and reported to the British government authorities before it can be made public. Currently, they have not made a final decision and must wait until January next year to finalize the results of the entire investigation, and report to the authorities in March. However, this investigation was divided into several small groups, which took turns visiting factories, mines, industrial areas, and commercial institutions. They were also deeply grateful for the warm hospitality and assistance provided by officials and business leaders from various places. He especially conveyed his gratitude on behalf of all members of the delegation.

Regarding the state of Chinese industry and commerce, Sir Paulson expressed: China has suffered extremely heavy losses during the eight years of the War of Resistance. Transportation is lacking, and one cannot expect much from the current state of industry and commerce, but the future of Chinese industry and commerce is definitely optimistic. The Chinese government authorities recently issued an order banning the import of certain types of foreign goods, which is not a common practice in other countries. However, the main reason for this is to balance China's imports and exports and stabilize economic policy. Fortunately, he heard that this ban is temporary and that there may be exceptions under certain circumstances.

Comparatively speaking, China's current industry is still underdeveloped. We hope to help China build industry and balance imports and exports, importing more raw materials and fewer non-essential items. I (Sir Paulson said) could not find items I wanted to buy for my wife and children in England, but I could buy them in Shanghai. Luxury items should certainly be banned from import.

Among China's export products, soybeans are the largest category. According to the investigation, the number of soybeans awaiting export has increased two to three times compared to before the war. However, due to transportation difficulties, it has not been possible to export them in large quantities. On the British side, there is also a reluctance to sign trade agreements in advance without assurance, which delays delivery. If goods are to be delivered in six months, they must be delivered on time, otherwise, it is better to state it in advance to avoid losing credibility.

Regarding the Sino-British commercial treaty, Sir Paulson stated that it was not within the scope of his mission and he was not in a position to express an opinion. However, he said that the treaty does not only involve commercial matters and is currently being negotiated by the foreign ministries of the two countries.

### Textile Management Committee Decides That Cotton Yarn Pricing Will Not Change Until the US Cotton Purchase Issue is Resolved; Encouraging Private Spinning Mills to Purchase Domestic Cotton in Production Areas; Mills Buying One Bale of Domestic Cotton Will Be Allowed to Buy Three Bales of US Cotton

[Our Newspaper's Report] The 13th meeting of the Textile Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs was held at 3:00 PM yesterday at the City Hall Meeting Room. Wu Xisui, the chairman, Tuan Zhen, and committee members Dong Xijian, Wang Qizi, Tang Xinghai, Rong Hongyuan, Wang Yangxian, and Yang Xiren attended. Li Huopa, Liu Jingji, Wu Kunsheng, Pan Shihao, Rong Yixin, Guo Qiong, Xu Zixin, Wu Chengdao, Wang Bingdao, Wang Bingjun, Zhou Jiasheng, Shen Boqi, and Tang Zhiliang attended as observers. The meeting was presided over by Wu Jian, Chairman Guo Zhen. The discussion at the meeting was quite fierce, and it did not end until after 6:00 PM. The important proposals and resolutions are recorded below:

Proposal from the 6th District Cotton Spinning Association: (A) Please adjust the cotton yarn pricing as a whole. The reason is that the fixed price is not related to the current market, and the wages of raw cotton have changed significantly compared with the previous month. If it is not changed, the production yarn factories will be trapped. It is proposed to determine the increase and decrease of the price each month based on the negotiated price of the previous month and suggest an increase of 200,000 yuan based on the current price of 1.75 million yuan. Resolution: (1) Each yarn factory should report its production volume and cotton stock to the Textile Management Committee from today. (2) The negotiated price will not be changed temporarily until the US cotton purchase issue is resolved. The discussion will be held two weeks after each yarn factory reports its production volume and cotton stock. (B) Raw cotton should be purchased as soon as possible: It is now the cotton season, and domestic cotton has been launched. We should take the opportunity to find ways to purchase it. However, the production of domestic cotton has been insufficient in recent years and is only used for spinning coarse yarn. Therefore, most of the raw materials of each factory depend on US and Indian foreign cotton. Since the foreign exchange and restrictions, the source of foreign cotton has been cut off, and the stock of cotton is decreasing day by day. Therefore, we should plan for both to avoid production setbacks. Resolution: (1) Each private spinning mill will jointly organize a cotton purchasing institution to purchase cotton in cotton-producing areas such as Zhengzhou. (2) Each yarn factory that purchases one bale of domestic cotton will be allowed to buy three bales of US cotton. Those who buy more can infer from this ratio. (3) Regarding the purchase of US cotton, Mayor Wu will negotiate with President Song to determine the method. (C) The allocation and distribution of cotton warp should be determined: The distribution of yarn last month was in response to a temporary emergency, and its quantity and method had the disadvantage of cutting one's feet to fit the shoe. In addition to the allocation to consumers by manufacturers, there should be room for maneuver for insufficient or unsuitable allocation in foreign transportation and consumption. Resolution: (1) The distribution of 14,000 pieces of champion competition each month for the replication industry will continue temporarily in November. (2) In addition to those used for weaving by each yarn factory and those needed by each replication industry and retail yarn shops, they are allowed to be transported to other places for sale.

### Requests from the Replicated Goods Association: Approval of Yarn Count and Exemption of Advance Payment for Yarn

The Shanghai Cotton Yarn Replicated Goods Industry Association's Yarn Allocation Committee's opinion on cotton yarn allocation certificates roughly stated that yesterday's Spinning Control Conference decided to implement a yarn allocation certificate system for the replicated goods industry. This was agreed to in principle at the Association's tenth committee meeting, but the following points should be considered for comprehensive consideration: (1) Yarn Count: Please investigate and approve the yarn count. Previous allocations of yarn were not entirely suitable for practical use, and each time the yarn count and quantity varied, making distribution difficult. It is requested to investigate and determine the existing equipment and past business conditions of the yarn factories, as well as the yarn counts they produce and the quantities. Refer to the yarn counts used by various replicated yarn factories, and separately approve the yarn counts they should be responsible for allocating. Compile statistics to facilitate mutual coordination and avoid repeated changes. Resolution: The Sixth Textile District Association shall compile a statistical list of produced yarn counts by next Monday. The Sixth Cotton Spinning District shall designate several individuals to conduct a survey of the allocation situation at various replicated factories, together with one member dispatched by this Association. (2) Please Specify Delivery Dates Separately: In the past, the Association experienced delays in delivery dates from yarn factories when receiving cotton yarn. This was due to the mismatch between the yarn factories' production volume and sales volume, resulting in unfinished products at the time of delivery. Accurate statistics should be compiled on the yarn factories' production capacity, and their delivery dates should be specified separately, so that recipients can go to pick up goods on a fixed date. Resolution: Passed in principle. (3) Exemption of Advance Payment: In the past, when paying for yarn, only a warehouse receipt was obtained, which had to be used to pick up the goods within ten days. However, delays occurred in reality, as already requested for transportation. Therefore, it is requested to exempt advance payment for future yarn allocations and instead change to paying and picking up goods at any time according to the previously mentioned delivery dates. Resolution: Interest should be refunded for delayed periods. If the factory refuses to refund, it can be reported to the Spinning Control Committee.

### Manufacturers Must Notify Yarn Industry When Selling Surplus Yarn

Regarding yarn merchants: (1) According to the above decision method, each factory shall sell half of the surplus yarn to ramp merchants, and the other half shall be supplied to old customers by the factory or handed over to the Yarn Industry Association for allocation. Factories that sell to old customers should issue a notice to the Yarn Industry Association. The Mayor also announced that starting tomorrow, if a form is not submitted, the Public Utilities Bureau will impose a power outage penalty on the factory for at least three days. (2) Maintain 1,500 pieces per month for the Yarn Industry Association to meet retail demand.

### Strengthen Distribution Organization

Spinning Control Committee proposal: (1) The organization of the Investigation and Sales Committee was resolved at the Association's ninth meeting to be strengthened. The current distribution problem is extremely heavy. Please discuss and decide how to strengthen the Distribution Committee. Resolution: In the future, the Replicated Goods Industry Association can send two representatives and the Yarn Business Association can send one representative to attend meetings of the Distribution Committee.

### Approval to Spin 23-Count Yarn

(3) According to the Sixth District Association, Hengtong, Guangqin, Chongxin, and other factories are spinning 23-count yarn. Please set the price at 10% higher than the standard price for 20-count yarn. At the Association's talk show on November 21, it was decided to first investigate whether the various replicated industries requested the allocation of 23-count yarn before discussing the price. Now, after reviewing the yarn application forms submitted by the various replicated industries, there is no request for the allocation of 23-count yarn. However, since the factories have this product, should the Sixth District Association's proposal to price the 20-count yarn at 10% higher be approved for record? Please discuss and decide. Resolution: Approved.

### Few Machinery Imports, Used Goods Fetch High Prices

A foreign firm in the city stated that since the end of the war, there have been no imports of machinery used in civilian industries. The foreign machinery industry has not yet returned to normal after the war, so a large supply will still take some time. The various types of machines owned by various foreign firms in the city are also very few. Therefore, used machine parts are fetching higher and higher prices. Currently, a used 2-3 horsepower diesel engine requires about 3 million yuan per unit, and there is no definite price for higher horsepower power machines.

### Over 300 Silk Weaving Companies Apply for Loans

### The Good Times for Chinese Stocks Are Not Lasting, the Third Period Delivery Begins, Short Sellers Hurry to Roll Over Positions, Market Prices Plunge and Still One-Sidedly Fall

Yesterday, the third period delivery of Chinese stocks began, and the shorts put on pressure as soon as they entered the market. The spot prices were very close, and the financial gangs were unable to arbitrage. Therefore, overnight floating long positions became sales, and they rose again. At the beginning of the morning market, there was a slight opening. After the opening, the shorts first put on pressure, and short necks rushed to roll over positions. Numbers 177, 106, 180, and 203 were all sold, and they immediately fell sharply. However, after the low, numbers 198, 185, and 199, etc., made up positions. After 10:15, they rebounded slightly.

In no time, there were sales when floating long positions met high prices, and the trend changed again. Numbers 157, 233, and 212 came to sell, and the decline was very rapid. Near noon, there was a lack of support, and the market almost universally cut long positions. People's hearts were extremely fragile, and once the decline started, it was unstoppable. Near the close, because the current delivery opened more than ten yuan, numbers 207, etc., finally intervened to arbitrage, so the price of 450 yuan for current Yong Yarn was temporarily maintained. The result was that Xian Yong Yarn, Meiya, Xinnuo, and Xinguang Jingfu all fell by 10% compared with the previous closing price, Huafeng and Qinxing fell by 5%, and cold stocks such as matches fell by more than 10%. The rest fell slightly by 5% or less. In the afternoon, the trend was still one-sided, and number 186 continued to sell spot and delivered Yong Yarn. Supply exceeded demand, and after the arbitrage was squeezed out, the delivery finally deteriorated. In an instant, match number 142 was sold off urgently and the price was stopped from falling further. The delivery Xinnuo had a transaction at the price floor. Near the close, spot delivery turned up, while delivery continued to fall to a low price. The difference after closing was only 2-3 yuan. There was no profit to be made, and the distorted phenomenon was extreme. As a result, compared with the previous closing price, Yong Yarn, Meiya, and Xinnuo all fell by 10% to 15%, Jingfu, Xinguang, Qinxing, and Huafeng fell by about 10%, the cold stock matches fell by 15%, Xin Ya Yong Gong fell by 10%, and Liyun opened only one transaction in the morning, which was slightly higher than before.

### Few Transactions in Foreign Firms' Tea

In the foreign tea market, general cargo owners continue to come out, but the buying interest of various export firms is still limited, and only fine goods are taken. Therefore, there are few transactions.

### President Wu Youxun of Central University Returns to School Next Month

Returned to Native Place to Bury Ancestors

[Our Newspaper Nanjing] Wu Youxun, President of National Central University, who was rumored to have resigned, graduated from Southeast University and studied abroad, and served as a professor at Tsinghua University. It is reported that after the victory, Wu smoothly progressed in Central University's reinstatement equipment, requesting funds to add and build school buildings, and there was no problem affecting his resignation. However, Wu is completely a scholar, often with a scholarly temper. He is subjective and does not want people to interfere in his personnel administration. Due to historical relationships, there are professors from the North and South, and their opinions may differ. Wu is a pure scholar with little administrative skills, or he may have developed the intention to resign due to temporary criticism from some professors. It is said that Wu has considerable relations with professors from both the North and South factions, which can be used to reconcile them, so that they will not become passive. After Wu left the school and returned to his native Jiangxi, there was much speculation outside. On the student side, because they shared weal and woe with President Wu in Chongqing and have not yet attended classes since reinstatement, they are deeply afraid that if the president is replaced and the person is not suitable, it will greatly affect their academic future. Therefore, the students' unanimous slogan is "Bring books to read," and the student union unanimously retained President Wu to return to school. Wu's departure from school this time to return to his native Nanchang was for the burial of his ancestors, not to resign. It was recently learned from Secretary General He of the school that President Wu had recently written a letter saying that he would come to Beijing next month. It is heard that the Ministry of Education has no intention of replacing the president of Central University.

Director Gu Yuxiu Discusses the Current State of Atomic Energy in Various Countries

After returning to China, Director Gu Yuxiu of the Shanghai Education Bureau spoke to reporters about the current state of atomic energy in various countries. He stated that European and American universities made significant contributions to national defense science during the war, and various research efforts are continuing after the war, especially atomic energy research, which has been very successful. The largest atomic energy laboratory in the United States is at the California Institute of Technology, headed by Professor Lawrence, a Nobel Prize winner. The world's largest atomic particle separator, weighing 40 tons and with a diameter of 184 meters, is housed in this laboratory. Recently, two Chinese professors have been assisting Lawrence in his work: Professor Ren Zhigong of Tsinghua University's Radio Department and Professor Zeng Zhaolun of Peking University's Chemistry Department. Furthermore, when the U.S. Navy conducted atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll, Chinese professors Zhao Zhongyao and Wu Dayou were present to observe and gained much knowledge. The second largest facility after California is the Princeton Atomic Energy Laboratory. Lawrence hopes that China can send 30 students to be placed in atomic energy research laboratories at various American universities. Currently, England, France, and Switzerland have also achieved significant success in atomic energy research. European and American atomic energy experts, based on experimental results, have definitively discovered the possibility of applying atomic energy in construction, especially in medicine and physiology. Mr. Gu attended the centennial celebration of the Swiss Natural Science Society and participated in a conference where concrete decisions were made regarding future cooperation in scientific research among various countries.

32nd District Promotes Water Conservancy and Transportation: Taoshupu River to Be Dredged, Zhenjiang North Road to Be Repaired

The 32nd District (Zhenru) District Office believes that the Taoshupu River within its jurisdiction is not only an important waterway for navigation and a source of irrigation water for farmland, but also a source of drinking water for nearby residents. Recently, the river has become heavily silted, and the river water is foul and black, which seriously affects water conservancy and public health. The matter was reported to the Public Works Bureau for dredging. It is reported that the Public Works Bureau sent a surveying team to the district on the 25th of this month to conduct preliminary surveys. Dredging will begin as soon as the surveying work is completed.

[Further News] Zhenjiang North Road in Zhenru District is an important transportation route from Zhenru to Jiangqiao Town. Due to years of disrepair, the road is rough and uneven, and many of the bridges along the road have collapsed. District Chief Xia, local gentry Huang Yueyuan, and Chen Dayu, Principal of the East China Vocational School, initiated repairs and requested the Shanghai Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to allocate 200 bags of flour for work-for-relief purposes, as well as 140 bags of cement for construction materials. The Public Works Bureau has also sent personnel to supervise the project, which is scheduled to begin on December 5th and is expected to be completed in about a month.

浙江漁民生涯
The Life of Zhejiang Fishermen

16th Dispatch: Chu Yusheng, Special Correspondent for this Newspaper in Hangzhou

In Zhejiang, among the 21,762,248 people, over 80% rely on agriculture for a living, and 5% depend on fishing. Calculating this 5%, there are over a million people who rely on handmade boats, handmade fishing nets, and their own labor to seek the traces of fish in the sea. Regarding the recent situation of the Zhejiang fishing industry, I have already reported in the article "On the Zhoushan Islands" on September 5th. Now, I will simply reflect on some aspects of their lives as a reference for those concerned about the fishing industry.

(1) Zhoushan Islands

The Zhoushan Islands should be the first to be mentioned among Zhejiang's major fishing grounds. Zhoushan Islands, entirely under the jurisdiction of Dinghai, consist of 185 islands. Among them, Daishan and Changtu Island are areas that produce large yellow croaker and small yellow croaker. Fishermen often come here during the spring and autumn seasons. The Shengsi Islands, under the jurisdiction of Jiangsu Province, are areas that produce hairtail. Fishermen gather here in winter. It is said that almost all the people on the Shengsi Islands are fishermen from Zhejiang. Therefore, some say that the Shengsi Islands should originally belong to Zhejiang, but were reluctantly assigned to Jiangsu Province because Jiangsu had no fishing grounds. We will leave aside the question of whether the Shengsi Islands should belong to Zhejiang, but it is undoubtedly true that the sea area south of Yantai in Korea and north of Taiwan is the home of Zhejiang fishermen.

These million fishermen are scattered across the Zhoushan and Shengsi Islands, with very few guarding their own fishing boats and drifting in the ocean. They are truly destitute. When the fishing season is about to arrive, they borrow money from their usual creditors or fishing companies. The interest rates charged by creditors are particularly high, exceeding 1.2% this spring. Although fishing companies claim to "not charge interest," they require fishermen to sell their catch at a discounted price when they harvest, which is no different from heavy exploitation. The fishermen borrow money with pain but repay their debts with blood and tears. This ancient tradition of honesty, simplicity, and generosity provides security for creditors and fishing companies. As long as they lend the money, they can sit back in their armchairs and wait for them to repay the money and fish.

(2) Heavy Burden on Fishermen

There are also some who use capital to build wooden boats specifically for renting to fishermen who do not even have broken boats. This spring, for three months, each boat required a rent of 70 Shi of rice. Estimating based on the price of 70,000 yuan per Shi of rice in Shenjiamen, this amounts to 5 million yuan for three months. When we inquired at a dried fish shop in Hangzhou, yellow croaker cost 2,000 yuan per Jin and hairtail cost 3,200 yuan per Jin. This means that 2,500 Jin of yellow croaker or 1,562.5 Jin of hairtail at Hangzhou's market price is needed to repay this 5 million yuan boat rent. However, Hangzhou is two and a half days away from the production area. After passing through fishing companies, resale to dried fish shops, transportation costs, and interest, the market price becomes 2,000 and 3,200 yuan per Jin. If sold directly to fishing companies at the production area, especially fishing companies that lend money to fishermen, the price is so depreciated that it is unimaginable. How many tens of millions of Jin would be needed to repay the entire debt for this season!

When the fishing season arrives, in the middle of the night or at dawn, when the fog is thick, they must wake up their fellow boatmates and force them to open their drowsy, tired eyes. On the vast, boundless ocean, children call out to their parents, the old care for the young, and they pass on the experience they have gained through years of groping around. If one is not careful, the boat hits a reef, or the wind is too strong, the waves are too fierce, and the rudder is unstable. Those who know how to swim quickly tell everyone on the boat to crouch down. If it capsizes, everyone on the boat drowns in the ocean, and the rolling waves send them to places they have never been. Struggle! Eventually, they are devoured by the fish they originally wanted to catch. The creditors still inquire about their families and even demand that the families repay the debts.

(3) Worship of Gods

Fishermen seem to have no right to read books. Therefore, many are illiterate. They do not know that the times are progressing. They do not know how to protect their own lives. They do not know how to reduce their burden to enjoy legitimate rights? They only know to use the simple fishing gear passed down for thousands of years and the habits and experience passed down for thousands of years to fish, fish! From birth to death, they live by fishing! Everything is entrusted to fate, everything is entrusted to nature. As a result, they are particularly superstitious and their lives are particularly romantic. The most worshiped Bodhisattvas among them are the West Mother Goddess and the Erlang Bodhisattva. According to legend, a long time ago, an old fisherman encountered danger at sea and drifted to a small island. The island was desolate, but there was only one temple. Inside the temple was a female Bodhisattva. The old fisherman had no food for several days on the island, but the Bodhisattva's offering table was supplied with fresh bread and other items every day. Therefore, almost every island in Zhejiang has a West Mother Goddess Temple (the legend of the Erlang Temple is similar). During the peak fishing seasons in spring, autumn, and winter, the West Mother Goddess Temple and Erlang Temple are filled with incense. The romantic aspects of the fishermen's lives are also fully exposed at this time. They seem to believe that "there is only today, no tomorrow"; so they indulge in pleasure, drinking until they are completely drunk, gambling until they are penniless, and engaging in prostitution and entertainment, stopping at nothing. They do not think about waiting until they have no money to want money. They fundamentally believe that "money is an external possession" and that "poverty is destined," so when they are penniless and poor, they entrust everything to the will of the Bodhisattva.

(4) Improving Lives

This spring, the fishing catch was too poor. They said: "This is because the people who made vows to the Bodhisattva last year did not fulfill them enough." Therefore, in early summer, the incense at the West Mother Goddess Temple and Erlang Temple was even more abundant. Some even borrowed high-interest loans to "fulfill their vows."

In fact, the quality of the fishing catch can also be known in advance. Just investigate the ocean currents, water temperature, specific gravity, salinity, water color, transparency, and biological content. It's just that our government in the past did not bother to pay attention to these things, and the creditors and fishing company owners who made money from the fishermen did not think about the shame of gaining without labor.

Now, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has paid attention to these issues, but the problems that exist among the fishermen are still maritime security and high-interest exploitation, the inability to freely buy and sell, and so on. Although Zhejiang Province has been trying to borrow six landing craft in Shanghai, landing craft have flat bottoms and are not suitable for the open sea. Fishing boats drift for hundreds of miles, and landing craft cannot protect them. Although the Agricultural Bank of China and the Zhejiang Provincial Local Bank have already provided loans, the Agricultural Bank only allocated 100 million yuan in loans to Wenzhou and Yuhuan, and the Local Bank only lent 20 million yuan to Wanghuan and 30 million yuan to Xiangshan. However, the main island of the Zhoushan Islands, Dinghai, which has the most fishermen in the top-tier fishing grounds, has not received any loans. The timber for old-style fishing boats to supplement losses from the United Relief Association will not arrive until next year. Although the government has been trying to ban fishing companies and establish fish markets to allow free buying and selling, the power of the fish market ultimately cannot defeat the fishing companies.

Based on the above account of the actual lives of fishermen and a review of the current facilities for alleviating their suffering, we feel that we must step up our efforts. Today, the fishermen's problem is not only a political problem, but requires the combined efforts of all scientists and economists to thoroughly solve it. Otherwise, the lives of fishermen will never improve. If the lives of fishermen cannot be improved, they will only regress. Because the lives of fishermen cannot be improved, fish production will decline, causing the good fishing ports in the East China Sea to be eliminated.

漁業二三事
Two or Three Things About the Fishing Industry

Su

The fishing industry is one of China's important production industries. Broadly speaking, it includes the capture, processing, and aquaculture of aquatic products, as well as other related departments. Therefore, it is also known as the aquatic product industry. This industry has been valued by entrepreneurs in the current process of economic construction, and the 1 billion yuan in fishing loans released by the China Farmers' Bank this time, although small, is enough to encourage fishermen along the coast to form fishing cooperatives as soon as possible. This article will provide a bird's-eye view of the recent state of the fishing industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, for the reference of domestic people.

集會紀盛
Meeting Highlights

The center of the fishing industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces is indeed in Dinghai, Zhejiang's ocean waters, so the description should start from Zhejiang. The opening of the Ningbo, Taizhou, and Wenzhou Fisheries Construction Conference has been even more vigorous. At 9:00 AM on the 20th, the Ningbo Sixth District Commissioner's Office organized the meeting. Participants included Wu Xianzhang and Shao Zonggao, representatives of the Agricultural Bank of China, as well as Yu Jimin, Commissioner of the Sixth District, Chen Youhua, County Magistrate of Yin County, Ge Yanlin, County Magistrate of Zhenhai County, Zhou Lingjun, County Magistrate of Fenghua County, Zhu Muzhi, County Magistrate of Dinghai County, Li Jie, County Magistrate of Ninghai County, Meng Zhu, County Magistrate of Xiangshan County (represented by Xu Huanwen), Mao Xianyou, representative of the seven district cooperatives, Jin Jifu, representative of the fisheries association, Rao Yongbi, Director of the Zhejiang Fisheries Bureau, Ye Mei, Director of the Cooperative Management Office of the Construction Department, Le Jishi, representative of the National Fisheries Company Joint Office, Yu Fengyuan and Chen Yuetao, Commissioners of the Sixth District, Li Xingjie and Hu Guomen of the Ningbo Fish Market, Shi Jinchun of the Yin County Fisheries Association, Xie Baoyou of the Yin County Cooperative, Shi Qinghua and Cao Shihao of the Dongqian Lake Cooperative, Xue Guosheng of the Ninghai County Fisheries Association, Lin Xiuting and Shen Dechang of the Fenghua County Fisheries Association, Lin Shangliao of the Tongjiao Cooperative, Wang Shisun and Hu Jiabin of the Hongxi Cooperative, Shen Tianyuan of the Qifeng Cooperative, Xu Huanwen of the Xiangshan County Fisheries Association and Shibu Cooperative, Chen Yuan of the Nanjiushan Cooperative, Miao Bangyong of the Dinghai County Fisheries Association, Ma Longtu and Ding Xiaomei of the First Cooperative, Cao Xinfu of the Shenjiamen Cooperative, Wang Xiguang of the Zhenhai Fisheries Association, Zhu Zubian, Jin Ligang, and Dai Wenxian of the Daxi Cooperative, Zhao Cisheng, Wu Bifeng, Hu Dewen, and He Zhizhen of the Zhejiang Aquatic Products Construction Association, and Lin Ke and Wu Ge, representatives of Ningbo, Shen Yu and Bao Maorong of the Ningbo Branch, and Feng Zikang, representative of Dinghai, totaling 48 people. At this grand meeting, although some representatives were fishermen, they were dressed smartly when they joined the meeting and mingled with local officials and bankers.

漁貸貧配
Distribution of Fishing Loans

Fishing loans are allocated to fishing cooperatives in the fishing areas of Ningbo, Wenzhou, and Taizhou, in proportion to the number of fishermen employed and the number of fishing boats in each area. Ningbo accounts for 55%, Wenzhou accounts for 25%, and Taizhou accounts for 20%. The guarantee procedures and repayment methods have been determined as follows: A. Guarantees from cooperative members to the cooperative: (1) Joint guarantee of fishing gear, (2) Guarantee from merchants and shops, (3) Fishing catch and assets of cooperative members, (4) Mortgage of fishing boats and fishing gear. B. Guarantee from the cooperative to the bank, guaranteed by the local county government. Secondly, personnel should be dispatched to supervise the issuance of fishing loans. The methods are as follows: (1) Personnel dispatched by the guarantors of each county should supervise at any time, (2) The Zhejiang Aquatic Products Construction Association and the Provincial Cooperative should jointly send personnel to check whether the fishing loans are issued to fishermen who have joined the cooperative, (3) The cooperative that obtains the fishing loan should first prepare three copies of the list of members who have joined the cooperative, one copy should be sent to the guaranteeing county government, one copy should be sent to the Zhejiang Aquatic Products Construction Association, and one copy should be sent to the local Agricultural Bank of China for reference. If there are additional members, the list of members who have joined the cooperative should be submitted within one week of joining, and the date of joining and other items should be filled in, (4) Each cooperative should prepare a certain number of shares to participate in the fish market in each place as share capital. The Provincial Cooperative will send personnel to be stationed in each fish market to monitor the use of fishermen's loans and may appropriately提成(ti cheng, not in dictionary, likely a kind of commission) to encourage savings. The distribution of this 1 billion yuan in loans is entirely managed by the Provincial Joint Cooperative, which is responsible for organizing the Aquatic Products Association, and the amount of loans was also voted on at the meeting. Dinghai in Ningbo received the most loans, at 150 million yuan, followed by Fenghua at 135 million yuan and Xiangshan at 95 million yuan. The number of loans in Linhai, Wenling, and Sandou in Taizhou is also not small. Since no representative from Wenzhou attended, the allocation number should be determined separately by the area.

劃分漁場
Demarcation of Fishing Grounds

The conference suggested that the government should quickly demarcate the boundaries of inshore and offshore fishing grounds to avoid disputes. The so-called inshore fishing grounds focus on the sea area within 200 meters of the coast. According to the discussion of general scholars, this important area is also called the "sea fence." Because it is close to the shore, the depth is not great, and from the sea surface to the seabed, it is greatly affected by sea currents, tides, and waves. Sunlight can also penetrate to a considerable extent, and water temperature and specific gravity change appropriately. Moreover, the materials washed in by rivers from the land are very rich, which is very conducive to the breeding of plankton and various aquatic animals. The value of inshore fishing grounds should be based on this kind of sea fence area as its scope. However, in the deep sea, there are also occasional shallow areas within 200 meters. This kind of land standing in the deep sea is the best fishing ground. Just like the plateau on land, its difference in water depth from the surrounding deep sea is great, then the fishing ground is better. Because the sea current collides with this land, it becomes an rising current, which stirs up the water and changes the tune. For migratory fish, it can often make their fish groups inhabit here, which is very convenient for fishing. The next discussion focused on how to assist in the construction of Nanjiushan and how to prosper Changtu Port. The proposers will allocate detailed methods. Then the discussion turned to the restoration of Zhejiang Aquatic Products School and how to raise the school's funds. It was decided that the association should send people to Dinghai to conduct a clear investigation before discussing it further. The proposal turned to the issue of protecting fishermen. In addition to fishermen enriching their self-defense forces, the government was requested to allocate a 100-ton to 200-ton diesel steel-hulled ship as a fishing protection ship, and the government should supply military uniforms, weapons, and ammunition. However, the fishing protection funds should not be used from fishermen, and the Zhejiang Aquatic Products Construction Association and the Provincial Fisheries Union will raise them.

帶魚汎期
Hairtail Fishing Season

Fish production along the coast of our country is available in all four seasons of the year, and it is inexhaustible and inexhaustible. Among them, there is only a slight difference between the peak and off-season of fishing. Now it is winter, which is the hairtail fishing season, and the fishing area is biased towards the Shengsi Islands and Sheshan waters in Jiangsu Province. Shengshan, the gathering place of fishing boats, is worth mentioning. Shengshan has a very small area, not as large as Hong Kong. Its position is outside the mouth of the Yangtze River, southeast of Huabiao Island. The island is full of mountains, with the highest peak 700 feet above sea level, but there are few trees. Although it looks verdant at a glance, when you are on the ground, you only see barren smoke and weeds, and strange rocks. The island's fish production, yellow croaker in spring and black seabream in summer, is already huge in number, but hairtail is the top. The estimated value reaches more than 100 billion yuan. This kind of hairtail has a narrow and long body like a belt, a completely silver-white color, and sharp teeth. Every winter, it migrates from north to south and begins to be caught on Xiaoxue Jie (Minor Snow Solar Term), (November 22nd). Although there are no less than 10,000 fishing boats, 85% come from the fishing areas of Zhejiang Province. Therefore, Zhao Cisheng, Supervisor of the Zhejiang Aquatic Products Construction Association, sent representative Lin Ke to Shengshan in the name of Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Co., Ltd. to supervise this year's hairtail fishing season and crack down on bad fish companies, because the biggest pain for fishermen is being defrauded by fish companies, and high-interest loans are the second biggest. The most noteworthy thing is the actions of pirates. Pan Zhaocai, a huge bandit who has been entrenched on the island for many years, sells flags (small triangular flags with a white "Pan" character on a red background) and cards (i.e., Pan bandit's business cards with a small photo of Pan bandit) to support the bandits. There are about 200 rifles and pistols and 7 light and heavy machine guns. Although the provincial government has taken measures to appease them, they have not complied with the order. At present, the pacification agency has drafted appropriate measures to eliminate pirates. However, Pan bandit uses Shengshan as his lair, widely sets up concubines, and enjoys luxury, just like a local emperor. It is really difficult to make him turn over a new leaf. Only his secretary, Ke Ruiliang, who has a little literacy, still has insight and has made a small contribution to the creation of education and improving the intellectual level of fishermen, especially by suppressing the fish companies' use of scales, changing the 18-tael scales to provincial municipal scales, which has won the hearts of the fishermen.

國產三輪汽車試車成功
Domestic Three-Wheeled Vehicle Successfully Tested

8th Dispatch: Li Shaolin, Reporter for this Newspaper in Tianjin

The successful manufacturing of three-wheeled vehicles by the Tianjin Automotive Manufacturing Plant, which belongs to the Pingjin District Automotive Repair and Parts General Factory of the Ministry of Communications, is tantamount to the nascent sound of China's automotive industry. This successful experiment has inspired all the engineers in their plant, and the work enthusiasm of more than 400 technicians has also been enthusiastically encouraged. The Pingjin District Automotive Repair and Parts General Factory is composed of the former North China Automotive Industry Co., Ltd. and Yifeng Rubber Factory and Fuji Battery Factory, etc. In Tianjin, it has two directly affiliated factories, one is the Tianjin Automotive Manufacturing Plant, and the other is the Tianjin Automotive Repair Factory. The successful manufacturing of three-wheeled vehicles is the achievement of the Manufacturing Plant. The person in charge is thinking that, after a period of time, they will be able to further manufacture general large passenger vehicles, so that there will be domestically produced passenger vehicles running on highways across the country.

初步設計
Preliminary Design

The design of the three-wheeled vehicle began in February of this year. Under the joint research of Director Huang Zhi of the Manufacturing Plant and more than 20 engineers, they referred to the equipment capacity of the Manufacturing Plant, the actual needs, and the advantages and disadvantages of various models. First, it was decided that the ideal three-wheeled vehicle should use a single-cylinder air-cooled type, and then the Japanese Daisetsu brand three-wheeled vehicle would be used as a blueprint to start drawing and manufacturing. The manufacturing work actually started in March. Some technical difficulties and work obstacles were resolved with continuous efforts. So, at the end of May, the first domestically produced three-wheeled vehicle, unprecedented in China, was assembled and left the factory and drove on the road. By the end of August, nine more vehicles had been completed one after another. Among these ten completed three-wheeled vehicles, there are seven canopy vehicles, one jeep, one truck, and one chassis vehicle. The Manufacturing Plant plans to manufacture 50 vehicles by the end of January next year. The assumed production volume is one vehicle per day from January to March next year, three vehicles per day from April to July, and after August, all equipment will be used to its maximum capacity, and five vehicles can be manufactured every day.

全部自製
All Domestically Produced

These three-wheeled vehicles, in addition to the magnetos, transformers, and other minority electrical materials on the vehicles, all the required 1,102 parts are manufactured by the Manufacturing Plant itself. Each part has to go through three or several or more than a dozen procedures. A total of more than 10,000 procedures are required to complete the required parts, plus assembly. The assembled sedan weighs 800 kilograms, the canopy vehicle weighs 770 kilograms, and the jeep-style vehicle weighs 650 kilograms. Each vehicle can carry three to five passengers. The truck weighs 680 kilograms and has a load capacity of 650 kilograms. The chassis vehicle weighs 485 kilograms and has a load capacity of 750 kilograms. The three-wheeled vehicle has a horsepower of 7.5, and a road 1.3 meters wide is sufficient for driving, and a road 4.8 meters wide can turn around at one time, because its minimum turning radius is only 2,400 mm. The fuel tank on the vehicle can hold three gallons of gasoline, and the oil tank can hold one gallon of lubricating oil. The maximum speed is 50 kilometers per hour, and each gallon of gasoline can be used for 40 kilometers. Recently, the factory accepted the price for customization. The canopy vehicle is 4.5 million yuan, the jeep-style vehicle is 4 million yuan, the truck is 3.6 million yuan, and the chassis vehicle is 3.2 million yuan. This kind of three-wheeled vehicle is not only suitable for transportation in urban areas, but can also be an ideal means of transportation for short-distance transportation in rural areas.

公開試車
Public Test Drive

On September 28, the Pingjin District Automotive Repair and Parts General Factory used these ten first batch of domestically produced three-wheeled vehicles to conduct their first public test drive in a convoy in Tianjin. They circled around a week in the bustling city of Tianjin. When these vehicles were running on the road, pedestrians looked at them with surprised eyes. In particular, the red cloth signs hanging on the vehicles, "Domestically Produced Three-Wheeled Vehicle," attracted more attention. This initial achievement in the national industry has obviously attracted the attention of society. The orders for these vehicles from the Northeast and Shanghai and other places show its own value. The form of the three-wheeled truck is the same as that of a large car. After the streamlined front, there is an iron-clad cargo bucket. The sedan-style passenger car is streamlined from head to tail, with two rows of seats inside. The back row is a long leather chair that can seat three people, and the front row is two small leather chairs, which are divided under the left and right car windows in the car. The canvas top of the canopy vehicle can be easily installed or lowered. Being light and flexible should be a unique advantage of this vehicle. In addition, thanks to the installation of the muffler, it does not have the deafening noise of a typical motorcycle after starting.

工廠內部
Inside the Factory

The Tianjin Automotive Manufacturing Plant, which manufactures three-wheeled vehicles, includes six factories. The first factory is metallurgy. All work such as alloy smelting, sand turning, and casting belongs to the metallurgy factory. The second factory is machinery. All work such as drilling and planing of various machine parts belongs to the machinery factory. The third factory is electrical, and all electrical machine parts that can be manufactured by themselves are completed by the electrical factory. The fourth factory is sheet metal. All iron plates and iron sheets required for assembling the car body and car box belong to the sheet metal. The fifth factory is carpentry, which is responsible for manufacturing all the necessary wood installations on the car. The sixth rubber factory is responsible for manufacturing inner and outer tires and various rubber parts. The Manufacturing Plant now has more than 400 workers, more than 20 engineers and technicians. To enable mass production of three-wheeled vehicles, they need to increase the number of workers

Free Talk: Brawl by Young Husband
The efforts of the authorities to rectify traffic in recent months have been witnessed by all citizens of the city, and everyone is genuinely admired and respected. However, there are some practical difficulties, such as narrow streets, poorly maintained roads, too many vehicles, and insufficient traffic police personnel, etc., which limit the effectiveness to some extent.

Analyzing these difficulties, they are nothing more than a matter of money, manpower, and time. We also know that the municipal authorities are determined, willing to work, and have many experts to assist them. In the near future, we believe that these difficulties can be overcome and resolved one by one.

However, why are man-made hindrances constantly emerging? If we are allowed to say something harsh, it is simply satirizing the efforts of the authorities, or saying that it is a joke.

There are too many examples of these obstructions to traffic. For example, the brawl between the driver of the No. 3 bus and the traffic police the day before yesterday. Both are affiliated with the municipal government and are traffic workers. It is too disrespectful to the citizens of Shanghai for such an incident to occur, disrupting traffic for as long as two hours. I believe the municipal authorities should take responsibility for this case. If this trend continues, the actions of us ordinary people will depend on the whims of others. What kind of city will this be?

The transportation company has its own explanation, and the police bureau has its own explanation. In short, they are all ignorant of the bigger picture.

The virtuous and hardworking mayor has been going deep into the community for days, seeking out the people's concerns. Yesterday, he even braved the wind and rain to go to Jiangwan. Can he give a fair punishment to this case!
### Second World War Secrets: Atomic Bomb Nearly Exploited by Nazis 1
Translated by Lan Ning from the November "Reader's Digest"

(Editor's Note: Readers may have heard about the story of how the atomic bomb was nearly exploited by the Nazis, but most of them are not detailed. Here is a translation of the record of the sabotage of the Nazi atomic bomb production from this month's "Reader's Digest." The original article was published in the American "Minneapolis" Tribune and was written by F. Sanden. This is a relatively detailed and complete report.)

One morning in February 1944, the heavily loaded railway ferry "Hydro" was breaking waves in Lake Tinn in Norway. Suddenly – a thunderous roar erupted from the lower deck. The ship suddenly tilted, shaking and stopping. Five minutes later, the "Hydro" sank to the bottom of the lake, taking with it Hitler's dream of completing the first atomic bomb. Behind this explosion lies the most shocking and tense story of this war, which could have affected the fate of all mankind.

Information

As early as April 1940, the international scientific community already knew that the German Kaiser Wilhelm Institute was conducting large-scale atomic fission experiments. After the establishment of the Manhattan Project (Note) in the United States in 1942, the British Ministry of Economic Warfare received shocking intelligence: the Germans ordered Norsk Hydro, a Norwegian electrochemical plant (the largest in the world), to increase its production of heavy water from 3,000 pounds to 10,000 pounds a year. This can only mean one thing. Allied physicists discovered that heavy water is an ideal "moderator" for the production of potassium-235. Because the Allies did not have enough heavy water, and it would take another year and a half to refine it, they finally used black chalk as a substitute. However, British intelligence confirmed that the German Kaiser Institute's experiments far exceeded those of the Allies. Sabotaging Norsk Hydro and destroying the heavy water stockpile there immediately became the British War Cabinet's top priority. The Air Force Staff said that it would be impractical to bomb this needle-sized target surrounded by towering mountains with all the planes available at the time. This was a commando mission.

A little earlier, several Norwegian resistance members had seized a coastal steamer, the Garsan, and sailed through the mine- and submarine-infested North Sea to Aberdeen, England. One of them was a hydroelectric expert who had organized an underground resistance group in Norway, named Einor.

He was immediately summoned to the headquarters of the Special Operations Executive in London. This strong and alert engineer was proficient in skiing and shooting – ideally suited for the current mission. He was extremely calm and decisive. Even better, he had lived within a few miles of the Norsk Hydro plant. His brothers and friends had considerable status there.

At the headquarters of the Special Operations Executive, Einor met Dr. Transda, who had been the design engineer of the Norsk Hydro heavy water plant. This doctor was the one who developed large-scale heavy water production. Before the war, he was friends with many German nuclear physicists, so he was one of the non-Germans who knew the most about the German "atomic bomb" program at the time. At the end of 1941, Transda escaped to Sweden and flew to London.

Sabotage

Einor asked Transda: "In your opinion, can Norsk Hydro be sabotaged to the point where it can no longer continue production?" According to the doctor's explanation, the factory was a seven-story, strongly constructed permanent mud-steel skeleton building. It and nearly ten adjacent equally strong hydroelectric plants were perched on a cliff in a thousand-foot-deep valley. All access roads and the factory were guarded by carefully selected German troops. The surrounding steep mountains were almost impassable. This was indeed a difficult task. "But, of course, we are willing to try," he said.

Einor was immediately sent to a Special Operations training camp. He quickly learned how to use shortwave transceivers, codes, parachuting, and so on. Then he received his final instructions. He was ordered to return to Norway immediately, collect every piece of information about Norsk Hydro, transmit it to London, and await the arrival of reinforcements.

One moonlit night, Einor jumped from a British bomber and landed straight down into the Norwegian mountains twenty miles from his home. Before sunrise, he had skied safely home and had breakfast with his mother. "I'm on a skiing trip," he told his family. He was quite worried for the first few days, but clearly no one knew that he was related to the Garsan incident. (To be continued)

(Note: The Manhattan Project is another name for the United States' massive atomic bomb production program.)
Miraculous Skill by Cai Lin
Marshall once experienced the slight skill of the Chinese "Robin Hood" at the Nanjing Railway Station, and a "horse theft" case occurred. Marshall expressed surprise at this.

In the past, a detective captain in Suzhou asked a pickpocket: "Can you pick the watch out of my pocket?" The pickpocket said, "Of course I can. Just pass through Shantang Street (where there is a very lively vegetable market in the morning) at about nine o'clock tomorrow morning." The captain let the pickpocket go. The next morning, he passed through Shantang Street, and the watch in the pocket of his uniform really disappeared without him knowing it..."

"Dead people need to keep an eye on the three coffin boards," this is the cold words of those who have never encountered a pickpocket.

Recently, the police局 has been working hard to eliminate pickpockets, but the day before yesterday, I encountered such a thing; I bought two train tickets and had 30,000 yuan more. For safety's sake, I bundled the 30,000 yuan in three stacks with a rubber band, and tucked the two train tickets on top of the banknotes held by the rubber band, and then hid them in the pocket of my coat. Then I buttoned the button on the pocket.

The passengers on the No. 3 bus were so crowded that the car was almost about to break apart. I was squeezed on the bus for less than twenty minutes. When I got off the bus, I found that the button on the pocket inside my coat was unbuttoned. When I reached in, I broke out in a cold sweat. The loss of the money was a small matter, but the two train tickets were for sleeper berths. Losing them meant that I couldn't buy replacements, which was no small matter.

After searching in my pocket, I found a rubber band and two train tickets. The money was gone.

I can only thank such a righteous thief, and I believe that his powers are vast. There is a difference between the hand伸出 from the coffin and him.
Transformation: Jeep Becomes Tiger, Gold Becomes Dirt by Xiao Nan
There are many kinds of transformations: turning an orange north of the Huai River into a trifoliate orange south of the river is a change in form; seeming one thing but being another is a change in nature; as for the "different ingenious tricks" of magicians, that is a transformation in theater.

No matter what, in China, it can be completely changed beyond recognition: dancing, which is originally a normal social activity, is transformed into a licentious and immoral game; the jeep of the "omnipotent doctor" is transformed into a troublemaker that runs wild; air transport, which is convenient for transportation, can be transformed into the best tool for smuggling; even receiving can be transformed into "robbery"; gold bricks are transformed into "copper blocks"; gold is transformed into "dirt"; traitors are transformed into "judges"; complete machines are transformed into scrap metal; all kinds of perversions are truly amazing!

"Poverty leads to change, change leads to prosperity." China is a poor country, so there are many changeable phenomena. All changes are for the sake of money! And with financial resources, there is nothing that cannot be achieved.

"The superior man changes like a leopard, his spots becoming brilliant." The "man" of the superior man is transformed into the "leopard" of the wild beast. From the outside, it still looks like "his spots becoming brilliant", and it does not feel fierce and terrible. This is the best kind of "change". Only in our "land of culture and civilization" can we find it.

China, which is so changeable, how many tricks are left to change? And how far will it change?
Mixed Praise and Criticism by Guang Chun
A certain evening newspaper reported that Brigadier General George, the former head of the U.S. Foreign Surplus Materials Liquidation Committee's Shanghai Branch, had a constant stream of corruption cases during his tenure. Since his dismissal, it is said that the Materials Supply Bureau of the ××院 has often been in contact with George in his work, and has been hesitant to give him a "commendation", and has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to transfer to the National Government to issue a certain medal of the Republic of China. This matter was told to a reporter by an American businessman, who said after speaking: "I don't know if the medals that your country gives to foreigners are divided into two types, praise and criticism."

The author would like to explain that the division of Chinese medals into two types, praise and criticism, is not limited to those given to foreigners. Since China and foreign countries are one family, and the world is for all, there is no special "preferential treatment" for foreigners. However, according to experts, Chinese medals are divided into 50% praise and 50% criticism, which is why they embody the "Doctrine of the Mean".
"No Doctor, No Medicine!" by Qin Zhi
Some people are overly sensitive, and a little illness causes a lot of trouble. In fact, this kind of oversensitivity does not help health!

Although Mr. Wu Zhihui is old, he is in good health and rarely gets sick. If he happens to have a minor illness, he adheres to the creed of "no doctor, no medicine" and relies on his own natural treatment from diet and daily life, refusing all the famous Chinese and Western doctors introduced by his relatives and friends.

Lu Xun, who died of lung disease, had his lungs examined by a foreign doctor a year before his death, who said that if a European had Lu Xun's lung disease, he would have died years ago. There is also Mr. Chen Guofu, who is more tenacious and effective in resisting disease than Lu Xun. He has suffered from third-stage lung disease for twenty years, has coughed up countless times, and has suffered countless fierce diseases. During lectures, he put a paper phlegm box in front of him, and spat phlegm while lecturing. When he finished speaking, he had filled several phlegm boxes, but he dealt with the disease very calmly and optimistically. While ill, he continued to hold important and busy positions in the government, and the disease could not defeat him.
Black Tickets by Chi Mo
Now it is very difficult to buy train tickets again. Whether it is express train tickets or slow train tickets, it is not easy to get them.

Chen Bozhuang said it beautifully, calling on passengers to cooperate and not buy black market tickets. You must know, who would want to spend more money to buy black market tickets, but if you can't get white market tickets, you have to resort to the black market. Furthermore, where did this stack of tickets in the hands of those who sell black market tickets come from? This can only be understood without being spoken.

The information desk can also buy tickets with invitations, but you must have "connections" or a "brand name".

The "single helper" has revived again. Most of these single helpers are women, and they have a very big style and are very generous. They are familiar with people in the station and can turn around. The goods they carry are not just "a glance". They don't have to do it themselves. The "red hats" carry them into the military station. Bundles of cloth, wool, cigarettes, and sugar only need to drop some "long ingots", and they can earn several "coffin" ingots. Although the baggage fee has been increased again and again, they (single helpers) don't care at all.

The luggage racks in the carriages, under the seats, and at the entrances are all filled with goods. If someone says something fair, then they have a lot of people. Two fists are hard to beat four hands. Good men should not fight with women.

Unexpectedly, the two routes of transportation under the blue sky and white sun are controlled by single helpers again.
Shanghai Cross-Section: The Organization of the Hua Zi by Huang Jia Mo 1
Local Beggar Gangs

Shanghai is a prosperous and wealthy big city, and its strength is enough to support a large number of parasites and more. Therefore, the "hard picking" beggar gangs of the North, the "gun code" beggar gangs that originated in the north and south of the Yellow River, and the "wind and moon" beggar gangs that roamed the Jianghan area, they have long seen Shanghai as a golden city and jade pass, and they will not easily give up this good place. However, the "old brothers" beggar gangs are not willing to let go of their territory. Because the "old brothers" are all Jiangnan natives in the Suzhou and Shanghai area, although the history of this gang is short, and it is not as long as the above-mentioned beggar gangs, with generations of "bowls" of incense. However, they appear as latecomers, and the brothers in the gang are all locals, so they are not willing to let the foreign paupers usurp the host's position and divide Shanghai, this lucrative position. Because the "old brothers" beggar gangs have the advantage of location, their spirit of striving for life is incomparable to that of foreign beggar gangs. And the way they beg is also unique and original, and they never want to copy the old tricks of foreign beggar gangs. Therefore, in the late Qing Dynasty, when the power of foreign beggar chiefs was great, the old brothers gangs did not compete with foreign beggars for food because they sought other ways, so they did not have any conflicts with foreign beggars. Everyone lived in peace and begged for their own food. Therefore, the foundation can be cultivated and consolidated, and today's glory can be achieved. The doors of beggars, these are all the clever points of the "old brothers" beggar gang's dealings.

Originally the Qing Hong Gang

Although the old brothers are a group organization of rogues, on the surface they are unkempt and unclothed, but when they are mentioned, their rise dates back to the season when the Qing Hong Gang's power began to decline in the late Qing Dynasty. The Qing Hong Gang當年 had seen the world, and had蘊 many heroes in the world. When they declined from prosperity, those capable and 末流 gangsters did not dare to铤而走險 and流落 into rogues due to 困. Due to the pressure of the times, they gathered together and colluded with each other. They relied on Shanghai's commercial wealth and vast land. Thinking that there was great potential for development, they recruited troops and horses and divided their activities. The power of the gang became increasingly strong. Also, because the people in the gang had new ideas and were best at adapting to the needs of Shanghai society, in other words, they could "keep up with the times". This is not something that any "self-enclosed" old-fashioned beggar gang can achieve. Their way of survival is not entirely in begging, but in drilling for ways that they take "every opportunity." New tricks of "picking money" are emerging one after another. Today, they can advance and retreat. The more than three million citizens of Shanghai simply do not pay attention to them. Now the foreign beggar gangs have formed a precarious situation, and their power in Shanghai has been greatly reduced. However, the old brothers gangs are forever clinging to the Shanghai market, forming a deep-rooted superior force. (To be continued)
Filler by Yu Yuan
The news of the investigation team is almost over. I have two pieces of bad poetry, which I will give to her as a farewell.

"The investigation team arrived in a hustle and bustle, declaring that the mission would not be relaxed, not afraid of tigers and flies, and would not end until the stone was revealed.

Hundreds of confidential reports were made, almost none of them could be concluded, the tigers and flies were not caught, and a handful of Qingfeng was caught."
Low-Key Fate by Qing Ke
The municipal government is going to ban fortune-telling and superstitious occupations, so the city's "Institute of Fortune-telling and Philosophy" submitted a "petition" requesting the authorities to implement examinations and appraisals to determine acceptance or rejection. If the examination system is used for fortune tellers, that is a pioneering initiative since the Republic of China: I am very worried that many prostitutes, rickshaw pullers, vendors, water rats, etc., who are destined to be eliminated in the future, will also request examinations and appraisals by way of analogy, then the municipal government will set up an "Examination Bureau", add various specialized equipment, and hire ancestral teachers of various industries to preside over the examinations. This expense is quite considerable.
Let's just look at it this way by Jiang Liu
The dance hall business is also in a slump, and the New York nightclub is also announcing a clearance sale. Many people are worried about the economic panic in Shanghai, but I am happy for the day when the municipal administration will be cleared. Why? Because unemployed dancers will become prostitutes, and prostitutes will be eliminated, from now on women will have to be forced to "go back to the kitchen;" men can be politicians or businessmen, and each can be content with their own duties. Probably the events of fraud, corruption, embezzlement, and oiling will be completely eliminated from now on.

### Chen Huanzhi's Last Two Long Shots: Green Team Defeated Black and White Yesterday; 38 to 33, the Visiting Team Suffered Their First Defeat; in the Men's Game, Black and White Defeated Donghua

The Black and White and Green teams, two women's basketball teams from the Philippines and Shanghai, met last night at the Municipal Gymnasium. Using women's rules, the audience braved the rain to attend, with about a thousand people. The Green team relied on Chen Huanzhi's last two long shots to defeat the visiting team 38 to 33 and win. In the first half, Black and White were in the lead all the way, with a score of 16 to 13. Chen Wangrun's skill was agile and her performance was particularly outstanding. It is a pity that center Huang Rulan failed to score yesterday, leading to the defeat, which is a great pity. In the men's game after the women's match, Black and White defeated the Donghua football team 64 to 39. The first half was 31 to 27, with Black and White in the lead.

Black and White Women Take the Lead

At 6:30 PM, the women's teams Green and Black and White took the stage. The visiting team fielded Huang Rulan, Lu Shuhui, Wu Yuwu, Chen Yurun, Yang Xiuzhi, and Ouyang Meilan. The Green team fielded Huang Mingyuan, Rong Shujian, Wang Weizhen, Liu Zhenbao, Wu Ailian, and Wu Meixi. Chen Yurun scored first under the basket, breaking the deadlock. Huang Mingyuan of the Green team returned the favor. Liu Zhenbao made both free throws, putting the Green team ahead 4 to 2. Huang Rulan and Chen Wangrun also scored three points in a row with free throws. In the first quarter, Black and White led 9 to 6. In the second quarter, Chen Huanzhi arrived and replaced Wu Meixi. Liu Zhenbao retreated to become a defender. Mingyuan scored a point with a free throw, but Huang Rulan and Chen Yurun scored four points in a row, putting them ahead 14 to 11. After Yang Xiuzhi scored again, Lu Shuhui left the court and Cai Shuqiong replaced her. The Green team was 13 to 16 behind in the first half.

Last Two Shots, Green Team Declares Victory

At the beginning of the second half, Mingyuan made a long shot, and Huang Rulan made a free throw, putting the Green team ahead again 18 to 17. The visiting team launched a full counterattack. Chen Yurun scored two goals in a row. Ye Yiqing and Lu Shuhui replaced Ouyang Meilan and Cai Shuqiong. However, Lu Shuhui was injured and left the court not long after entering the court after colliding with Mingyuan. Chen Lixiang replaced her. The battle became even more tense, tying the score at 27 to 27, ending the third quarter. In the last quarter, Lu Shuhui recovered from her injury and re-entered the game, replacing Huang Rulan. Rong Shujian and Chen Wangrun both scored points with free throws. Chen Huanzhi made a long shot, surpassing the score again 30 to 28. At this point, the Black and White forwards were showing signs of panic, and the Green team took advantage of this. With 35 seconds left, Chen Huanzhi's two long shots sealed the victory. When Huang Mingyuan made a free throw, the allotted time ended. The visiting women's team lost to the Green team 33 to 38, their first defeat since arriving in Shanghai.

Football Style, Donghua Suffers Defeat

In the headlining match, Donghua played against Black and White men. Donghua fielded Youliang, Lin Gen, Banglun, Li Yao, and Longhai. Black and White fielded Shi Rongluo, Fu Yongxin, Xu Yinzhen, Li Jinzao, and Shen Renshou. Donghua adopted a full football style, relying solely on courage and lacking tactics. They were still able to resist in the first quarter, but then completely collapsed, fighting individually and without any coordination. Black and White entered an unmanned realm in the second half. There were many jokes in the whole game. Shi Rongluo of the visiting team scored first, opening the record. In the first quarter, they were twelve to Black and White's fourteen. In the second, Donghua's situation, showing signs of improving, Black and White's Renshou made the most of openings on both sides, and when they reached 30 to 19, Lin Gen fouled out, and Yu Qiaxing replaced him. Black and White led 31 to 27 in the first half. After the break, Black and White were still in good shape. At the end of the third quarter, Donghua was further behind, 27 to 54. In the final quarter, Donghua's Youliang again replaced Yu Qiaxing, but morale was low and there was no way to recover. In the end, Black and White won 64 to 39, their third victory since arriving in Shanghai.
