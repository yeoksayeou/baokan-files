### Statement from State Department Spokesperson: US Policy Toward China Unchanged, Denies Plans to Withdraw American Troops

[Central News Agency, Washington, 5th] A State Department spokesperson stated today that the rumors coming from Nanjing that President Truman had instructed Marshal Marshall to plan the withdrawal of American troops from China are incorrect. The spokesperson emphasized that current US policy toward China remains as Acting Secretary of State Acheson announced on June 28th and has not changed. The spokesperson, when referring to Acheson's statement that a general review of the Chinese situation would be conducted soon, stated that the so-called "review" does not necessarily mean a change in policy, but merely a clarification of the US position. The spokesperson refused to say when the "review" would be conducted at a press conference.

At 1:30 PM, he met with Qingdao reporters on the flagship ESTES, first giving a general description of his trips to Nanjing, Guling, and Shanghai.

He added that if US troops stationed in various locations are attacked again, the US military will take effective retaliatory measures. Finally, answering reporters' questions, he said that the three American soldiers injured in Anping have been sent to Qingdao for medical treatment, and the relatives of the injured will be notified.

[United Press, Tianjin, 6th] Major General Keller E. Rockey, Commander of US Marines in North China, said last night that he had not yet received orders regarding the withdrawal of US troops from China, but the number of American troops in Tianjin has indeed decreased. After the sniper attack on American soldiers on the 29th of last month, the US military has frequently made movements, and the garrison in certain locations has been strengthened. Currently, the mission of the US military in Tianjin is to guard US military property, protect the railway between Tianjin and Qinhuangdao, the Pingjin Highway, and the bridges at other key points. In addition, they are responsible for handling supply matters for the US military in North China. As for the families of US soldiers, none are currently coming to China. Although the situation is serious, it is believed that the US military in North China is sufficient to cope with any environment. The US military in Tianjin includes ground troops and an air unit, which are currently intensifying training, but the sole purpose is to stabilize the situation and implement Marshal Marshall's plan.

### Investigation Procedure Dispute Unresolved: Special Group to Anping Delayed

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 6th] The special group dispatched by the Military Mediation Department to investigate the American troop ambush case at Da Xiao Shahe was unable to depart again today. The main reason is the dispute over procedures. The North China side agreed to first send liaison personnel to ensure the safety of the group. Regarding the so-called procedural dispute, the government side stated that the communist side proposed that the CCP first draft a proposal for investigation procedures. Based on these procedures, the scope of the special group's investigation would include many areas in eastern Hebei, which the American side opposed. According to communists, the American side proposed that the investigation procedures must be in accordance with the small group actions agreed upon by Barr and the Three-Man Committee in Nanjing, and that the American representative could propose an agreement on procedures with the qualifications of chairman, but it would still be drafted by the American side. The communist side believes that since the American side is a party involved in this incident, it should not be bound by that agreement. This issue is still under negotiation. In addition, all three parties attach special importance to the selection of representatives for the group. The government side has changed its representative to Deng Weiren, Deputy Director of the Executive Headquarters.

[United Press, Beiping, 6th] Colonel Davis, leader of the Military Mediation Department's special group, began today to investigate the clash between American troops and communist troops near Anping on the Pingjin Highway on the 29th of last month in order to determine responsibility. Davis has already questioned several American officers involved in the case. Several surviving American soldiers will come to Beiping on the 7th for questioning. The group was formed on the instructions of Special Envoy Marshall and is scheduled to go to the scene of the incident on the 8th or 9th for on-site inspection.

### To Continue Peace Negotiations, The Military Reorganization Plan Must Be Implemented: Chairman Clearly Expresses Government's Attitude

Ambassador Stuart Meets with Zhou Enlai on the Night of His Return to Nanjing

[Our Newspaper, Guling, 6th] Ambassador Stuart left Guling at 9:00 AM this morning and took a plane to Nanjing, Chiang Kai-Shek sent his secretary Shen Changhuan with him to Jiujiang. Before this trip, Ambassador Stuart was extremely enthusiastic, hoping to do his best to break the current deadlock. Now, the people in Guling generally expect that after Ambassador Stuart returns to Nanjing, the future of the peace negotiations between the KMT and the CCP is still promising as long as the CCP can realize what they had previously talked about in time, take out the sincerity of the discussions and agreements made in previous meetings, otherwise the future of the peace negotiations is not optimistic.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] Ambassador Stuart arrived at Nanjing Dajiaochang Airport by special plane at 1:25 PM today. His personal advisor Chuan Jingbo came with him. Ambassador Stuart, newly recovered from his illness, was thinner than when he left Nanjing, but his spirits were still good. His advisor also looked slightly thin. The ambassador, wearing a white suit and carrying a raincoat, was surrounded by a small number of reporters at the scene for interviews. Before five minutes had passed, his advisor urged him to get into the car and leave. A record of the ambassador's answers to reporters' questions is as follows: He does not want to make any comments on the departure of the US military from China at this time. He met with the Chairman twice in Guling, but they discussed general issues and did not reach any concrete results. As for the peace negotiations between the KMT and the CCP, he hopes that they will not be affected by any other incidents. The future of the negotiations is still promising. From Stuart's remarks, reporters also learned that his two talks with the Chairman involved the reorganization of the government.

[Central News Agency, Guling, 6th] Continuing peace talks is the ambition of Ambassador Stuart's departure from Guling to Nanjing on the morning of the 6th. During this visit to Guling, the ambassador stayed for dozens of days. He has always maintained that the Anping incident created by the Communist Party should not "affect normalcy with abnormality." Even while ill, he has not forgotten his mission to run for peace talks. Seeing that he had continuous meetings with Chairman Chiang and Marshal Marshall on the Anping incident and peace talks, with the support of American public opinion and the State Department, and with his enthusiasm as a friend of China, he disregarded his new illness and traveled back and forth between Nanjing and Guling, which have a temperature difference of twenty degrees. Perhaps he can realize his ambitions and bring our country's situation into a new stage.

[Central News Agency, Guling, 6th] It is heard that before leaving Guling, Ambassador Stuart had obtained an expression from Chairman Chiang: Continuing peace talks should still prioritize the implementation of the established military reorganization plan and the restoration of transportation. The government has already shown concrete facts regarding the determination and progress of the implementation of these two proposals. If the Communist Party continues to create new incidents as a cover for not implementing old agreements, it will shut the door to continued peace talks and cut off the running and mediation of Marshal Marshall and Ambassador Stuart.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] After arriving in Nanjing, Ambassador Stuart immediately invited Zhou Enlai for a meeting in the afternoon. Zhou, accompanied by Communist Party representative Wang Bingnan, went to the American Embassy at 7:00 PM for dinner. After dinner, they began their negotiations in the living room facing the lawn. Those present were Ambassador Stuart and his personal advisor Chuan Jingbo, Communist Party representatives Zhou Enlai and Wang Bingnan, and another person in charge of recording, a total of five people. The conversation lasted until 12:07 AM. According to the spokesperson of the Communist Party delegation, the conversation lasted a long time, the content was in-depth, and the attitude of both sides was straightforward. The main purpose was to exchange opinions on important current issues and involved some fundamental issues, but no conclusions were reached. It is planned to continue the talks next Thursday when Marshal Marshall returns to Nanjing. It is heard that during this conversation, Ambassador Stuart conveyed the opinions he had talked about with Chairman Chiang in Guling to Zhou. It is believed that this meeting will definitely focus on the Anping incident and peace negotiations. It is not yet certain whether there will be further talks tomorrow, but further talks will be held after Marshal Marshall returns to Nanjing.

[United Press, Nanjing, 6th] Communist Party spokesman Wang Bingnan revealed today that Zhou Enlai will have dinner with US Ambassador to China Stuart tonight to hear Chairman Chiang's reply to the Communist Party's proposals for "unconditional ceasefire" and reorganization of the government in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference.

### Communist Army Completely Destroys River Dikes; Disaster Situation Extremely Severe in Hebei Province

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 6th] Taking advantage of the rapid rise of river water in Hebei Province, the Communist army completely destroyed the river dikes. On July 25th, they dug open the Majiaqiao Promotion Dike on the south bank of the Jishui River, ten kilometers north of Yangcun Town (26 kilometers northwest of Xiongxian County) within Xiongxian County.

Editorial

### International Democracy and World Peace

The European peace conference has been in session for a week, listening to representatives from 21 countries deliver speeches and state their views on post-war international politics. The 21 countries, regardless of size or strength, have an equal opportunity to freely express their opinions and are equally valued by other countries. This magnificent Luxembourg Palace has become an open international forum, which cannot be denied as a major progress in modern international politics, and can also be seen as a prelude to international democratization. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes said proudly in Paris: "The main purpose of the meeting is to allow representatives of all countries to express their opinions as much as possible, so I propose that the four powers should let the other 17 countries express their views on the draft treaty first; I also request that the five committees for reviewing the draft treaty should be chaired by representatives from countries other than the four powers." After hearing this enlightened speech, we almost believe that post-war international politics has entered a new era of peace and democracy. Countries, regardless of size or strength, and regardless of their contribution to the war, have an equal opportunity to speak in international politics; and the power politics that we have deeply hated will become a vestige of the times.

However, after the conference entered its second week, the representatives' speeches came to an end, and the actual work of the conference was about to begin; and the procedural issues that need to be resolved urgently were even more pressing. The day before yesterday, the conference's procedural committee met to discuss the methods and procedures for deliberation and voting. There were great differences of opinion among the countries, and there were great disputes, which were almost impossible to compromise; especially Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov insisted on his own opinions and refused to compromise, not only opposing the amendments to the conference procedure proposed by the British and Dutch, but also vehemently criticizing the attitude of the American representative, which was inconsistent. The air in the procedural committee suddenly became tense. On the surface, this procedure is only a disagreement between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and the United States, that is, the Soviet Union insists that the proposal must be approved by a two-thirds majority of the conference before it can be established; while the United Kingdom and the United States believe that it can be established as long as it is approved by a majority of the conference. If this is the case, the problem is not complicated, nor does it have major significance, and there is no need to pay too much attention to it. This is just a conflict of interest between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and the United States. However, in fact, this is a question of whether large and small countries are equal or not, that is, a question of whether international democracy is democratic or not, so all countries in the world, especially small and medium-sized countries, attach great importance to this and insist on the original proposal and refuse to compromise, which may put the conference in a deadlock.

But we want to ask, why does the Soviet Union insist that all resolutions passed by the conference must be approved by a two-thirds majority? After studying the composition of the representatives of the 21 countries attending the conference, it is not difficult to fully understand. Although the Soviet Union is in a leading position internationally, there are relatively few countries that share its goals and aspirations, so in any international conference, it is easy to encounter the pain of being a lone wolf; but how to maintain its special position in the international community so as to be equal to the United Kingdom and the United States? Therefore, it came up with a clever way to "control the majority with a minority." At the San Francisco Conference, the Soviet Union firmly insisted that the conference procedure should adopt a two-thirds majority method, and even more demanded that the permanent members of the Security Council exercise the "veto power" for the UN Charter. Since the establishment of the UN General Assembly, the Soviet Union has frequently exercised its veto power, which has caused great pain to the United Kingdom and the United States, and they have had to launch a movement to abolish the "veto power" internationally. In this conference, there are also five or six countries that follow the Soviet Union's lead, and there are also some countries' representatives who are in between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and the United States, hesitating and watching, and not taking a fixed position for the time being. When the conference submits the proposal to a vote, if the Soviet Union expresses its objection and does not want the proposal to be established, the Soviet Union can easily obtain the support of one-third of the countries, obstructing it and making it impossible to establish. In this way, any proposal that the Soviet Union does not agree with will not be established. On the other hand, the United Kingdom and the United States, although they are in an advantageous position in this 21-country conference, it is easier to obtain a majority than a two-thirds majority, so they advocate adopting a majority voting method. However, in order to express their concession to the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom also advocates that these two methods, namely majority voting and two-thirds majority, should be adopted concurrently in order to take into account the interests of both parties. Unexpectedly, it was met with the firm opposition of the Soviet representative, causing a dispute in the meeting.

This newspaper's editorial, on the day the conference opened, advised the representatives of the participating countries to hope that the conference would adopt democratic methods to create world peace. We still adhere to this wish, review the procedures that the conference should adopt, and express our objection to any method that does not conform to democratic principles. Although we warmly hope that the conference will proceed smoothly and be successful, we do not agree with the method of seeking perfection at the expense of principles, only respecting the views of the four powers, and ignoring the opinions of small countries. Since the peace treaties with Italy, Finland, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria have been drafted by the foreign ministers of the four powers, if they are unwilling to accept the opinions of small countries, then the conference will lose its significance of being convened, and it cannot but be considered that the four powers are just using the form of a conference to sign the peace treaties, and all decision-making power is in the hands of the four powers, which is completely the same as the peace conferences convened after previous world wars. What's more, the opinions among the four powers today are not the same, and it can be seen from the general situation in the procedural issues of the conference. How can such a conference complete its task of creating a permanent and reasonable peace? The Dutch representative said: "Any method that is unfair to the interests of small and medium-sized countries is enough to hinder the peaceful development of the international community." Australian Foreign Minister Evatt even spoke on behalf of the small and medium-sized countries, demanding that the conference adopt a democratic and open method to conduct a review of various issues. The voices of these small countries' representatives are worth pondering by the representatives of all countries.

In short, if international democracy cannot be realized one day, then true world peace cannot be created one day. Although the purpose of this 21-country conference is to create a local peace in Europe, it has a very close relationship with the future overall peace of the world. Whether the post-war world can enter a new era of peace and democracy, this Paris conference is a new test in the world's future.

Facilitating Commerce, Travel, and Military Transportation: Repairing the Yangzhou-Yizheng Highway

[Special Dispatch from our Yangzhou Bureau] The Yangzhou-Yizheng Highway is the only major route connecting Yangzhou County and Yizheng County. It is also the sole military communication line between Yangzhou and Yizheng. The road is 28 *li* long. Since the victory, it has been repeatedly damaged by the Communist troops, obstructing military transportation and commercial travel. Most of the bridge structures along the way (such as the First Bridge, Second Bridge, Yanhu Bridge, Third Bridge, Qiligou, Fourth Bridge, Bazib Bridge, etc.), have been completely destroyed, with only the main beams or foundations remaining. The local county government here recently felt the necessity of restoring traffic on this road for both military transport and commercial travel. Earlier this month, a special commissioner was dispatched to the road, under the protection of a certain unit of the 108th National Army Brigade. Together with the Yizheng County government, they surveyed the road in preparation for repairs. It was learned yesterday (the 3rd) that the surveying has been completed. The county government has already prepared the materials needed for the repairs, so construction is expected to begin within days. Once the Yangzhou-Yizheng Highway is repaired, it will certainly benefit general travelers and greatly enhance the vitality of military transport.

Northeast Anhui Recovered Areas: Actively Providing Relief to Refugees; Party-Government Supervision Team Established in Bengbu

[Special Dispatch from our Bengbu Bureau] After the National Army successively recovered Wuhe, Lingbi, Sixian, Tianchang, and Xuyi counties in northeastern Anhui Province, the local area was ravaged by war, and order has yet to be restored. The displaced victims are in urgent need of relief. The Anhui Provincial Party Headquarters, Provincial Government, and Provincial Assembly have jointly formed a Party-Government Work Supervision Team for the Recovered Areas of Northeast Anhui to supervise general local party and government work and promote post-disaster relief efforts in preparation for reconstruction. It is learned that the team is based at the former site of the municipal party headquarters in this city. The team leader, Wan Changyan, and deputy team leaders, Li Renfu, Chen Xiannan, and others, arrived in Bengbu from Hefei on the 1st. After days of deployment in Bengbu, preparations are largely complete, and supervisory work will soon begin. According to the person in charge of the team, the main tasks of the team in the future are to provide relief to refugees and pacify the area. The work plan includes organizing *baojia* (local security units) to secure residents, providing emergency relief to aid the people with food, eradicating locusts to protect the autumn harvest, and promoting epidemic prevention to emphasize hygiene. For emergency relief, the Anhui Relief Branch will first distribute 1,000 tons of flour. The authorities have promised to provide a large supply of epidemic prevention drugs. All staff members will depart from Bengbu within days to various counties in the recovered areas to advance the work in accordance with established procedures.

Taixian: Emergency Repair of the Baojia Dam Completed

The Baojia Dam, located outside the East Gate of this county, is the hub of the upper and lower river courses. On the evening of the 27th, during a major thunderstorm, a corner of the dam suddenly collapsed. River water surged upwards. After residents braved the heavy rain to repair it, it collapsed again shortly after. The next morning, the city river water of this county was about to reach the banks. The residences of several riverside households were already flooded. After receiving the report, the county government immediately ordered officials to conscript labor for emergency repairs, which have now been completed. According to records, the dam once collapsed in 1921. In the 25 years since, there have only been a few minor instances of water overflowing, and no major disasters have occurred. If the county government had not handled the situation properly this time, the autumn harvest in the lower river area would have been unimaginable.

### At the Peace Conference Rules Committee Meeting: U.S. and Soviet Representatives Engage in Verbal Sparring; The Voting System Issue Remains Unresolved

[Dispatch from our Bureau] Paris, 6th, Broadcast: The Peace Conference Rules Committee met today. Molotov spoke after Bernes, still insisting on a two-thirds voting system, claiming that this method was used at the San Francisco Conference, and the Soviet delegation cannot accept a method of deciding on proposals with eleven votes.

[United Press, Paris, 6th] U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov clashed at the Peace Conference Rules Committee meeting today. Byrnes accused the Soviet Union of attempting to command the conference through the Four Powers. Molotov replied that the Four Powers was an American concept. Byrnes responded to Molotov's accusation of contradiction by reading out various records, asking Molotov to understand that Byrnes's remarks had been published in the Soviet Union, just as Molotov's remarks had been published in the United States. Molotov then spoke again, reiterating the accusation of contradiction, and saying that Byrnes spoke in a serious and angry tone. The debate today was caused by the issue of whether the conference's motions should be voted on by a two-thirds majority or a simple majority rule.

[United Press, Paris, 6th] An unyielding Byrnes stated here today: Since the Potsdam Conference, the Soviet Union has been trying to limit the number of countries participating in the Peace Conference to the smallest number possible. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov is trying to make the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers (England, America, France and the Soviet Union) control the representatives of the Peace Conference. Bernes delivered a speech at the Peace Conference Rules Committee, responding to Molotov's speech yesterday accusing the United States of supporting Canada's proposal to hold the Council of Foreign Ministers' meeting concurrently with the Peace Conference, saying: "Since the convening of the Peace Conference, I have not said a word to blame the position held by the Soviet representatives, nor have I questioned the motives of the Soviet representatives. However, I was quite surprised to hear Molotov's words yesterday." Afterwards, the Rules Committee met again to discuss the voting procedure that had been the subject of intense debate. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Manuilsky spoke, asking the representatives to support the two-thirds majority voting rule passed by the Four Powers, saying that Ukraine wants to see a consensus reached through majority votes. If a consensus cannot be reached, it hopes that the greatest majority will pass the resolution, and that a two-thirds majority voting rule best reflects the wishes of the people of the formerly occupied countries. At the same time, a dispute between Czechoslovakia and Poland over the 420-mile area surrounding Teschen in Silesia threatens to create a new territorial issue for the Peace Conference. Polish Foreign Minister Romosky, the head of the country's Peace Conference delegation, told reporters that the area cannot be ceded to Czechoslovakia because of the ethnicity of its people. However, he hoped that the issue could be resolved through a friendly understanding with the Czechoslovak government. The region, with a population of 240,000, has been in dispute for many years. Czechoslovakia has now taken the initiative and has no intention of giving up its "demands".

### Foreign Minister Wang Expresses Views: A Two-Thirds Vote Could Cause a Stalemate; China, the U.S. and 13 Other Countries Support the British Proposal

[Central News Agency, Paris, 5th] China's attitude on the issue of voting procedures was clarified by Foreign Minister Wang Shijie at today's Rules Committee meeting. After careful consideration, Foreign Minister Wang declared that the Chinese delegation believes that some revisions to the two-thirds majority system proposed by the Four Powers Foreign Ministers in Paris last month are necessary and appropriate. Wang believes that the two-thirds majority system has its shortcomings because the adoption of this voting system may cause the following stalemate in the discussions of the Peace Conference, which may generate recommendations on the issues in the draft peace treaty. On the other hand, the Chinese delegation does not approve of the simple majority voting system proposed by the Netherlands, as it also has its shortcomings. Based on past experience, we must pay attention to the issue of voting procedures in these international gatherings. If the resolutions of the Peace Conference are produced by a simple majority vote, then the recommendations of this Peace Conference will only receive support from a minority of participating countries. Wang continued that the Chinese delegation intends to propose an amendment that requires the recommendations of the Peace Conference to be decided by an absolute majority vote, that is, a majority vote. However, after studying the British compromise proposal, we believe that the main points of our original proposal have been included in the British proposal, so we will no longer propose another amendment, but are willing to support the British amendment proposal.

### Organize a Subcommittee: Study Amendments; Czech Proposal Ultimately Rejected

### Five Powers Rotating Chairmanship: Confirmed by Our Officials

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] Regarding the issue of the chairmanship of the Paris Peace Conference, there has been much debate in the conference, and various reports have also been inconsistent.

### Finnish Sawmill: Mysterious Fire Cases

[Reuters, Helsinki, 5th] Since the beginning of summer, there have been several mysterious fires at Finnish sawmills. These timbers are all used as compensation to the Soviet Union, so the Party claims that this is done by Fascists. According to the Finnish Peace Treaty draft, Finland should give the Soviet Union the price of 300 million U.S. dollars in kind. The Finnish government feels that the burden is too heavy, and the fires in the sawmills have caused Finland's economy to suffer significant losses.

### Siam Officially Applies: To Join the United Nations

[United Press, New York, 5th] Siam applied today to join the United Nations organization. This is the eighth country to apply to join since the organization was founded.

### Jewish Organizations: Submit Memorandum to the Peace Conference

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 5th] The American Jewish Association, the British Jewish Public Council, and the World Jewish Congress jointly submitted a memorandum to the Paris Peace Conference today, demanding that the rights of Jews in the territories of Italy, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania be restored. The memorandum pointed out that the status of Jews in certain regions of the above-mentioned countries is far lower than that of other people, and anti-Semitic sentiments are even more tense. In short, all former enemy countries should guarantee the elimination of all discrimination against Jews, and Jews should restore all pre-war freedoms and property. If there are changes in national borders, Jews should be allowed to choose their own nationality.

### Molotov's Explosive Speech Day Before Yesterday: Contents; Firmly Opposes British and Dutch Amendments; Accuses the U.S. Representative of a Contradictory Attitude

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 5th] The Peace Conference Rules Committee continued its meeting. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov delivered a speech, firmly opposing the amendments to the Peace Conference Rules proposed by the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, and strongly criticized the U.S. representative's contradictory attitude, almost causing the Rules Committee to break down. His remarks were roughly as follows: The suggestion made by the Four Powers Foreign Ministers' Meeting stipulates that any resolution passed by the Peace Conference must obtain the consent of two-thirds of the majority. This suggestion should be accepted, and this kind of conference procedure has been adopted in the San Francisco Conference, and the effect is remarkable. It is difficult to understand why the same success cannot be achieved at this moment.

Any resolution passed with a two-thirds approval can be recognized by the world's democratic countries as having obtained unanimous agreement, so the Four Powers Foreign Ministers' Meeting also considered this. As for the amendment proposed by the British representative, which advocates adopting both majority voting and two-thirds majority methods, it is contrary to the resolution of the Four Powers Foreign Ministers' Meeting, so it cannot be accepted. The representatives of each country have the freedom to express their opinions and defend their views, but they must be consistent from beginning to end. However, it is contradictory to support majority voting today and advocate a two-thirds majority tomorrow. The U.S. representative is suffering from this. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes said that the resolutions passed by the Foreign Ministers' Meeting cannot restrict the Peace Conference's right to discuss these resolutions. This is very true. The Peace Conference can also discuss the issues that the Foreign Ministers' Meeting failed to discuss. The Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers can freely discuss, but they must uphold the matters that have already been decided. I suggested on the 30th of last month that the Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers should hold a meeting during the Peace Conference, and Byrnes expressed his agreement to this, but has suddenly changed his mind at this moment.

The Canadian representative made this suggestion, and the U.S. representative expressed his agreement, but expressed his disagreement when the Soviet representative made it. The French newspaper Le Peuple wrote an article saying that the United Kingdom and the United States seem to prefer the Peace Conference to adopt a majority voting method because this matter is beneficial to the United Kingdom and the United States. This is very true. In the United Nations, if unanimous agreement cannot be obtained, then adopting a majority voting method can be said to be sufficient, but it still cannot force the minority to be convinced. World opinion has not yet been able to understand this attitude, which is regrettable. Currently, there are only nine countries attending the Peace Conference that have been ravaged by the Fascists, namely the Soviet Union, Belarus, Ukraine, France, Poland, Abyssinia, Czechoslovakia, Greece, and Yugoslavia. If majority voting is adopted, then the victimized countries will become a minority, so I cannot express my agreement to this. We have not yet decided how to vote on an issue, but we should try to maintain the unity of the United Nations and maintain peace. The best way to maintain peace is to escape the traps set by warmongers. A two-thirds majority can make it easier for us to achieve this goal, but the suggestions passed by majority voting should also be given attention by the Foreign Ministers' Meeting. Finally, I advocate that the representatives of each country have the right to make proposals to the Foreign Ministers' Meeting.

This treaty can be renegotiated and amended on August 15. Signatory countries wishing to make amendments must notify three months in advance, but no such notification has been issued to date.

### Palestine Partition Plan: Both Arabs and Jews Express Rejection, Dealing a Major Blow to Round Table Conference; Britain Awaits Washington's Declaration of Attitude

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 5th] Regarding the newly drafted plan for Palestine, the Executive Committee of the Jewish Agency met this afternoon to discuss the matter and unanimously expressed opposition, stating the following reasons: (1) The British plan neither grants Arab independence nor Jewish independence. The provincial government system, with all its important privileges and even the legislative power of the provinces, is under the jurisdiction of the British High Commissioner in Palestine. The provincial governors are also appointed by the High Commissioner, making this system nothing more than self-deception. (2) According to the British plan, Jews are deprived of 85% of their settlements in Palestine, and they have no control over the colonization of the remaining 15% of the territory. (3) The area of the Jewish autonomous province is smaller than the Jewish state proposed by the Peel Commission in 1937. (4) The British plan does not provide guarantees and has no definitive nature.

[Reuters, London, 6th] The Executive Committee of the Jewish Agency in Paris has decided to reject the partition plan for Palestine as a basis for negotiation. This is seen here as a major blow to the convening of a London round table conference to discuss the Palestine issue. The Arab League has also expressed its rejection of the plan. Therefore, even if the round table conference is held, the Palestine partition plan cannot be submitted for discussion. President Truman has not yet expressed his opinion on the partition plan. Now that both Arabs and Jews have expressed rejection, the US government's attitude is likely to be one of opposition. Political circles predict that when the British Cabinet meets on Wednesday to discuss the entire Palestine issue, a formal response from the US will be presented.

Soviet Criticism of British and American Policy

[United Press, London, 5th] Radio Moscow today broadcast in English, vehemently criticizing the British and American plan to partition Palestine, stating that it is bound to fail without the assistance of United Nations agencies. This is the first Soviet commentary on the British and American plan. The radio station also said that the Palestinian people's desire for peaceful independence cannot be satisfied by such a plan. Millions of people are pinning their hopes on the work of the Paris Peace Conference, and they will surely ask themselves whether what is happening in Palestine is consistent with the principles of building lasting peace and ensuring equal rights for all nations. Freedom-loving countries once fought together against the Axis aggressors for these equal rights.

Jewish Underground Party Warns Britain

[Agence France-Presse, Jerusalem, 5th] The Jewish radio station "Voice of Israel" has just announced, "Serious events are about to begin." At the same time, the Haganah organization posted notices stating that the third stage of oppression of the Jews of Palestine is about to begin. No male immigrants are allowed to enter Palestinian cities. We must warn Britain that if this measure continues to be implemented, it will cause disorder and bloodshed. All Jews in Palestine, regardless of their status, will unite.

### Ten Days After Atomic Bomb Test, Still Potent Radiation

Commander Blandy First Boards Target Ship

[United Press, Bikini, 5th] Commander Blandy, commander of the atomic bomb tests, boarded a target ship for the first time today after the underwater explosion test on July 25th. He told reporters that eleven days after the underwater atomic bomb explosion, the target ships still have potent radiation, which is a form of poison gas warfare. A reinforced concrete dock sank today, making it the seventeenth target ship to sink. Radiological experts accompanied Blandy on a detailed examination of three ships.

[United Press, Washington, 5th] Rats that survived the atomic bomb tests will live out their family lives at the National Cancer Institute. Scientists at the institute are studying whether atomic rays affect their fertility. At the same time, they will also study whether radiation causes cancer in some people and eliminates cancer in others. In addition, they will study possible variations, such as color statistics, and other characteristics of the eyes, ears, and feet. The development of rats is very similar to that of humans.

Italian opera singer Gigli has expressed his willingness to adopt the girl.

### International Tribunal Begins Hearing Case of Japanese Aggression in China Proper Yesterday; Powell, Crippled in Both Legs, Continues to Arrive with a Cane; Former Wanping County Magistrate Wang Lengqi Also Attends to Testify

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 6th Dispatch] After the International Tribunal opened its session on the morning of the 6th, the prosecution first read out the indictment signed by Prosecutor Xiang Zhejunn of China, stating that Japan's aggression against China began with the Shanghai War in 1932 and continued until the end of the war, divided into four periods. The Nanjing Massacre case was given special attention in the indictment. Chinese Prosecutor Xiang Zhejunn and American Prosecutor Sutton will present detailed accusations against the Japanese for persecuting the Chinese people, especially for the crimes of the Japanese harming the Chinese people with opium and narcotics.

[Kaizosha, Tokyo, 6th] The Far East International Tribunal has concluded its hearing on the Japanese invasion of Northeast China. Starting today, it began hearing the case of Japan's armed aggression against other parts of China. Prosecutor Morrow made a statement, saying: "The statement I am about to make covers the entire territory of China outside of Northeast China. Using modern land, sea, and air forces, with the aim of conquest and plunder, Japan engaged in a planned military attack and military aggression. The conflict in Northeast China eventually spread to Shanghai. The Japanese attack on Shanghai on January 28, 1932, was a derivative of their invasion of Northeast China. At that time, the Japanese army encountered

The long-term resistance of the 19th Route Army, and a ceasefire agreement was reached on May 5 of the same year. The second invasion was launched five years later, similar to the first invasion, with combat operations beginning in the middle of the night. Initially, Chinese and Japanese troops clashed at the Lugou Bridge on July 7, 1937. The incident quickly developed, and Peiping was attacked and fell to the Japanese army. The Chinese army was forced to retreat westward. On August 13 of the same year, the Japanese army launched a second offensive in Shanghai. A vast expanse of fertile land between Nanjing and Shanghai was devastated by an undeclared war of aggression, leading to its desolation. This battle reached its climax with the Japanese occupation of Nanjing. The citizens of Nanjing were brutally massacred with bayonets and machine guns, creating a horrifying story. Its barbarity and tyranny were unmatched since Attila the Hun. In addition, captured Chinese soldiers were indiscriminately killed. The operations carried out by Generals Matsui and Hata and other generals involved attacking along railway lines and riverbanks. The Chinese coast was blockaded by the Japanese navy. Japanese warships sailed up the Yangtze River to assist the army in its offensive, while Japanese aircraft bombed Chinese cities.

At the height of the war of aggression, 250 million people in eastern China were placed under the control of the Japanese army and navy. Until March 30, 1940, when the Japanese established the puppet Nanjing regime, there were no formal regulations governing the detention and treatment of captured Chinese soldiers. Comparing the statistics of both China and Japan, it can be seen that during this four-year war, the number of Chinese people who died or went missing reached one million. This is the number of people who were captured and killed by the Japanese army. 411,000 people are not included in this number. The total number of dead and wounded was 3,217,940 (according to Chinese statistics). On December 8, 1941, the Japanese army launched a third invasion in Shanghai, entering the former International Settlement to arrest British and Americans and detain them. The crimes committed by Chinese non-combatants during Japan's military aggression against China will be discussed later. All defendants who carried out this military aggression are criminally responsible for the above-mentioned war." After the statement, J. B. Powell, editor of the China Weekly Review, took the witness stand again and answered the direct questions of Prosecutor Morrow, describing the situation of the two Shanghai battles.

Regarding the situation of the Shanghai War, [Powell] stated: "During the first Shanghai War, I saw many destroyers transporting troops landing in the Hongkou area and aircraft bombing in the Zhabei area. Fierce battles in the Hongkou, Yangshupu, and Zhabei areas continued until May. This time, the navy initially conducted the operations, and later the army also participated. Armored vehicles were used when occupying the North Station. The army brought tanks and heavy artillery, and the navy fired from cruisers. Japanese officials tried hard to resolve the situation. Shigemitsu, who is here now, was the Consul-General in Shanghai at the time, and he made particular efforts. The Japanese army's second attack on Shanghai was an army operation, landing in Wusong and attacking along the Yangtze River, developing in the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou triangle area. I glimpsed that Suzhou was severely damaged, and twelve villages were completely destroyed. The Japanese army's third invasion of Shanghai occurred almost simultaneously with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The British gunboat HMS Peterel was sunk, the American gunboat USS Wake was captured, and the former International Settlement was occupied by Japanese naval forces." After Powell finished speaking, he was cross-examined by American defense attorney Fan Si: "Before the first invasion of Shanghai, conflicts occurred, and the Shanghai International Settlement was garrisoned by the International Settlement Volunteer Corps, organized by the United States, Britain, Italy, Germany, Japan, and other countries. One of the reasons for the establishment of the corps was the agitation of the 19th Route Army in the suburbs of Shanghai?" (Answer) "Cai Tingkai, the commander of the 19th Route Army, had strong feelings about the Northeast Incident." (Question) "Did the Japanese army enter certain areas after defeating the Chinese army and engage in the invasion of Chinese territory?" (Answer) "Yes." (Question) "Did the fighting stop in early May, and a ceasefire agreement was reached, but did the Japanese side have a sincere intention to cease hostilities as early as early March?" (Answer) "There was such a plan and action." (Question) "Was the Shanghai Ceasefire Agreement an agreement to establish a neutral zone? Did the Japanese army indeed withdraw? Did Shigemitsu closely cooperate with the British and American sides?" (Answer) "Yes. Shigemitsu did not have the Japanese army's will to invade and did his best to resolve the incident." Powell then described how General Shirakawa and other Japanese officers were killed by a bomb at the former Hongkou Park (now Zhongzheng Park) during the celebration of the ceasefire agreement by the Japanese, and how Shigemitsu lost a leg. (Question) "Did the witness know that before the first Shanghai Incident, the anti-Japanese movement in Shanghai was very intense, and that the 20,000 Japanese residents in Shanghai were in considerable danger?" (Answer) "That was generally the case. There were 30,000 to 50,000 Japanese people." Powell then answered the questions of Prosecutor Dues, describing the crimes of the former Japanese Kempeitai in Shanghai, stating: "On December 20, 1941, all Shanghai reporters were arrested and taken to the Kempeitai headquarters, which was originally an apartment building, and the underground cell was transformed into an animal cage. I was thrown into that cell. There were 15 rooms in total, each 12 feet high and 18 feet wide. About 40 people were thrown into each room. Because the room was small and there were many people, everyone sat shoulder to shoulder in a row. The prison had not been cleaned since 1937, and the Japanese Kempeitai did not care about this at all. Food was only a small amount of rice three times a day. Except for breakfast, it seemed to have been left for several days and was inedible. In addition, there was a liquid of unknown name once a day. It seemed that someone was sending canned goods to the prison, but they were not given to us. Regarding medical care, there were medics and nurses who visited regularly. However, except for serious illnesses, no treatment was given. When I entered the prison, I weighed 145 pounds, and when I left, I weighed 70 pounds. Most people suffered from malnutrition. Guards used wooden boards for packing goods to beat the Chinese people up to 85 times. When violating prison rules, they would make people kneel in the Japanese style, facing Tokyo to worship, to show apology to the Japanese Emperor. We were forced to write letters falsely claiming to be healthy and were later sent to the former Jiangwan Prison. The food was slightly improved, but because of sitting on the ground for a long time, sores developed on our buttocks, and our feet swelled and turned black. Later, due to the aggravation of the disease, I underwent surgery in the hospital and had both feet amputated." After Powell finished his testimony, he left the court with a cane. Next, Wang Lengqi, the magistrate of Wanping County at the time of the Lugou Bridge Incident, testified, and the prosecutor read out his testimony, stating: "After the Japanese army occupied Fengtai, they controlled the transportation between Peiping and Tianjin, cut off the north from the central government,

Made North China a special sphere of influence, and planned to use the habitual tricks of invading Northeast China, wanting to occupy North China without losing a single soldier, so they began the so-called peaceful invasion. The Japanese side had previously obtained the cooperation of Chen Juesheng, the director of the Beining Railway Bureau, and used the name of railway operation to survey the area between Fengtai and Lugou Bridge. Later, the Japanese side wanted to lease or buy the area to build barracks and airports, but both were rejected by our side. The Japanese side then knew that a peaceful invasion was impossible and that an armed invasion must be carried out, thus opening the beginning of the Lugou Bridge Incident."

### Thorough Investigation of CNRRA's Work Scope Emphasizes Three Aspects; Investigation of Storage Warehouses in Various Locations Began Yesterday, Actively Clearing Accumulated Goods

The joint investigation of CNRRA by the Administrative and Supervisory Yuans has lasted for twelve days. It is learned that the scope of the investigation emphasizes three points: (1) the funding of CNRRA and the situation of its expenditure, (2) the cooperation between CNRRA and UNRRA and their contact, (3) the work situation of various departments of CNRRA, etc. In addition to specially assigning Supervisory Committee members Gu Fengxiang, Du Jianxun, auditors Wang Qichang, Qian Jimin, etc., to come to Shanghai to conduct an investigation together with Supervisory Commissioner Cheng, the Executive Yuan also sent Yin Zhongrong, Xue Quan, and Xia Pingfang to Shanghai to consult with Gu and Du and others on the method of conducting a joint investigation. Gu and the other seven people have a temporary office in the CNRRA office. They arrive at CNRRA at 9 am every morning to investigate each department separately and summon the responsible personnel for inquiries. It has been twelve days now. Yesterday, Gu and others also began to investigate the various storage warehouses of CNRRA in the Hongkou District. They inspected the warehouses from morning to noon, and they will continue to inspect the warehouses tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. They also plan to submit a report to the Supervisory Yuan. The CNRRA side is unwilling to express any opinions on this investigation work of the Supervisory Yuan and said that the findings of the investigation will be announced by the Supervisory Commissioner's Office.

According to Supervisory Commissioner Cheng, the investigation of CNRRA, except for financial matters, the investigation work of other departments can be completed within a week. However, the audit of financial matters will take time due to the large number of books. Therefore, it is still difficult to complete in a short period of time. As for the results of the investigation of CNRRA, they will be reported to the Supervisory Yuan. The Supervisory Commissioner's Office does not intend to make any announcements.

[Another Dispatch] Since UNRRA announced the suspension of transportation to China, all parties have paid close attention to this. The reporter specifically visited the CNRRA spokesperson yesterday and asked about the issue of resuming transportation. He said: "Regarding when UNRRA will resume transportation to China, we have not yet received any notification from UNRRA." The materials currently accumulated in the warehouses in Shanghai are all heavy machinery. The bureau has ordered storage and transportation personnel and machine assembly plants to work 24 hours a day in order to clear the accumulated goods in the warehouses as soon as possible. Most of these heavy machinery are surplus old military machinery purchased by UNRRA from the South Pacific, and they must be assembled before they can be transported to the interior. Sometimes it is found that the machinery is missing major parts, and they must be assembled. Transporting machinery from the Shanghai docks to the bureau's machine assembly plant at Zhenru Jinan University is a difficult task. For example, a large mining machine cannot move on its own and must be dragged into the factory.

Improving Transportation and Ordering New Methods

When asked about the past transportation situation, the spokesperson said: "Our bureau has always handled transportation work under extremely difficult technical conditions. In the past, UNRRA cargo ships to China did not notify our bureau of the ship schedule and cargo name in advance, so there was no way to prepare in advance. Now our bureau has requested UNRRA Director La Guardia to improve its procedures. The two sides have now agreed on new methods: (1) UNRRA agrees to notify our bureau's office in Washington in advance with ship cargo documents and cargo lists. (2) All UNRRA materials transported to China must be transferred to CNRRA in full in accordance with the basic agreement signed by the Chinese government and UNRRA. The two sides will hand over the goods at the side of the ship and shall not delay. (3) UNRRA canned food, transportation equipment, and machinery transported to China should be inspected in advance when they are loaded for export, and UNRRA will guarantee to our bureau that all items are in good condition, so as to avoid materials being stored in the warehouse because they cannot be used after arriving in China, making them difficult to handle. If the above-mentioned improvement methods are implemented, the difficulties in handling UNRRA materials by our bureau in the future can be expected to be reduced. In addition, in order to avoid materials being completely concentrated in Shanghai, UNRRA has agreed to consider using smaller sea vessels to transport goods to China, so that they can dock and unload cargo in smaller ports in the inland sea and rivers, in order to transfer them to the interior.

### Active Investigation of Grain Loan Case, Yang Xizhi Summoned This Morning, Part of Investigation of Entire Case Expected to be Completed by End of Month

The office has not transferred Wang Daren and Ren Xingyai from the garrison headquarters, nor has it summoned grain merchants to appear in court. If the interrogation this morning does not yield results, another court hearing will be scheduled. However, the investigative part of the case is expected to be completed by the end of this month. As for the issue of jurisdiction of the trial, it must now await the decision of the highest authorities, but it is believed that it may all be transferred to the judiciary.

### Inspection Ceremony Held Yesterday at Refugee and Orphan Reception Center; Orderly and Spirited; Mayor Praised Extensively in Speech

[Our Dispatch] Under the umbrella-like scorching sun, cars traveling between Shanghai and Caohejing continued to arrive. Mayor Wu Guozhen, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Kaixian, Deputy Director Li Jianhua, Director of the Health Bureau Zhang Wei, Chairman of the Municipal Party Committee Wu Shaoshu, philanthropists Dong Hefu, Zhu Xuefan, and UNRRA's Pride, all rushed to the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau's Refugee and Orphan Reception Center to participate in their grand inspection ceremony.

The former hooligans, pickpockets, beggars, street children, and vagrants who roamed the streets are now wearing uniform uniforms and lined up neatly on the square. When Mayor Wu and others ascended the review stand, six female refugee children sent by the US military presented flowers first, and then the team began the inspection. From beginning to end, the order was good and the steps were neat. I have seen this inspection twice now, but I have been brought to tears each time! Seeing them, I can't help but feel some sorrow. Why were they born without parents? And so they drifted! Roamed!

Mayor Wu said: "Today is the happiest day since I came to Shanghai. I was saddened by the decline of social morality in Shanghai, but that sadness no longer exists after coming here. I must first congratulate you all for jumping from roaming the streets to becoming the most useful people. Second, I want to congratulate the Republic of China. In the past, you had no concept of the country, but today, you have become the people who love the country the most. Now that you have come here, the government will definitely support you and cultivate you. I hope that under the leadership of Director Zhou, you will always move forward!"

Responding to Mayor Wu was thunderous applause and loud slogans: Long live the Republic of China, Long live President Chiang!

Overture, music, flower presentation, flag-raising ceremony, inspection, swearing-in, awards, cheers, human pyramid, calisthenics... Under the hot sun, the endless wonderful programs left every guest stunned. Everyone was wondering: are these the criminals of the past? Those annoying and hateful bugs?

Just as Director Zhou Zuwang said: "Ten months ago, if this group of people were put into society, I don't know how many police would be needed to suppress them, but now they have all learned self-government, distinguish right from wrong, and have become the productive stage of society."

How do they live in the institute? —Division of labor and cooperation, mutual assistance, work-study combination, equal emphasis on education and upbringing. Regarding all the organizations in the institute, the reporter has already provided a detailed introduction in the newspaper on the 2nd of this month, so there is naturally no need to repeat it. In short, this is their home. In the institute, they have found strict fathers and friends, sympathy and warmth! In the life of unity, they forgot themselves, and in the concept of "group," they will never be alone again.

Yesterday, the Central Film Studio has turned their activities into a movie, hoping that its public release will arouse people's sympathy and provide spiritual and material assistance, because the institute's funding is very difficult, and the society must help to make this meaningful work continue. And to achieve that there is no wandering waste in society, the father of the country called the "Great Harmony World not picking up what was dropped on the road and locking doors at night", the starting point is in this.

### Domestic Postage Increases Fourfold; Post Office Headquarters is Petitioning

[Our Dispatch] According to Wang Yuguang, Director of Postal Affairs, Post Office Headquarters, yesterday, the Post Office has submitted a petition to the Legislative Yuan to increase domestic postage fourfold in order to make up for the huge monthly deficit of 4 billion yuan. It is said that the proposal to increase postage fourfold was made two months ago, and now prices have risen nearly ninefold. Last month, the National Government was only able to make up for a portion of the postage deficit, forcing the bureau to borrow from the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau to balance its income and expenditure. The total amount of loans from the Post Office Headquarters to the bureau has accumulated to nearly 20 billion yuan. According to Deputy Director Wang's explanation, the reason for the huge monthly postage deficit is the rapid rise in prices. Today's postage is only 400 times that of 1936, while prices have risen 5,000 to 10,000 times during the same period. Wang also pointed out that the Post Office certainly cannot rely on government subsidies every month to maintain operations.

### Wearing Old Cotton-Padded Clothes to Visit the Cold Storage Room; Minus 25 Degrees Celsius Feels Like Entering the Arctic Circle

In the summer life of the city, ice is an indispensable necessity. It is estimated that in the hottest weather, the daily demand for machine-made ice in Shanghai is about 600 tons, and usually about 400 tons. The current ex-factory price of machine-made ice is 60,000 yuan per ton, which means that Shanghai people spend 20 to 30 million yuan on ice every day.

The main business of ice factories is still cold storage. At present, there are seven Chinese cold storage companies and five foreign cold storage companies in Shanghai, as well as several enemy properties that have been taken over. The reporter recently visited Maochang Cold Storage Company, the largest Chinese company with more than 20 years of history.

Making machine-made ice is in a rectangular pool containing salt water, divided into more than a dozen long grooves, and equipped with a dozen ammonia pipes. Filtered water is placed in specially made rectangular iron boxes, and then the boxes are placed in the grooves one by one, covered with wooden boards. Ammonia absorbs the heat, and salt water also plays a part in assisting. After 36 hours, the filtered water in the iron box freezes into pieces of clean white ice.

The ammonia cooler is on the fifth floor, with tap water dripping and dripping on the winding iron pipes. Ammonia is pressed out of the machine, passes through the cold storage room and the ice-making room, and the heat absorbed is cooled here. This back-and-forth cycle, if there is no air leakage or other losses, can simply be used endlessly.

Walking into the first cold storage room, I put on a thick old cotton-padded jacket, but my feet still felt frozen to the bone. This is not the coldest, the temperature is between 32 and 36 degrees Fahrenheit, the so-called ChillRoom by foreigners, which contains seafood, northern goods, fruits, western medicine, etc., and there are only twelve ammonia pipes on the ceiling.

The Freeze Room for milk powder, ice cream, etc. is so cold that people think they have arrived in the Arctic. Although the aroma is pungent, the temperature is about 0 degrees Fahrenheit, and there are 24 pipes on the ceiling. Going to the room where yellow croaker and cuttlefish are placed becomes more and more severe, and there are as many as 100 ammonia pipes. On the one hand, it is quite unbearable due to the cold, and on the other hand, the salty smell is really uncomfortable, so I retreated after a brief look.

But the coldest is the quick-freezing room, where the temperature is minus 25 degrees Fahrenheit. Most of the fresh goods must be frozen in this room before being stored.

When I went out, I saw a restaurant sending two baskets of spring chicken to be stored. This tells you a secret, why you can eat fresh goods at any time of the year. Shanghai's restaurants and cold storage companies can really be said to be interdependent and inseparable "wrongdoers"! (Fanshi)

### Beijing-Shanghai and Tianjin-Pukou Railways Select Combined Freight and Passenger Transport Stations

[Our Dispatch] In order to facilitate the flow of materials and the convenience of passengers, the Ministry of Transportation has successively tested combined freight and passenger transport on the Beijing-Shanghai and Tianjin-Pukou railways. The package transport stations are temporarily selected as: Tianjin-Pukou Railway: Xuzhou, Suxian, Guzhen, Bengbu, and Bengb埠头, Linhuaiguan, Mingguang, Pukou.

### Zhejiang Associations in Shanghai Plead with the Government to Exempt from Grain Requisition

The Zhejiang native Associations in Shanghai recently held a joint meeting. In order to appeal for the cessation of land tax requisition, they telegraphed Chairman Chiang, President Song, President Sun, etc. The original telegram roughly stated: Last year, the government ordered the exemption of land tax for one year, and it was a joyful sound. Today, land tax must be requisitioned in kind. Each yuan of the old tax is combined with the levy of borrowing and public grain must be levied more than five dou and four liters of rice. Based on the current rice price of 50,000 legal currency per stone, it has increased to tens of thousands of times. The magnitude of the increase is shocking. How can the poor and weak bear this? The 25% rent reduction has been implemented for a long time. The actual rice rent received by the landlords is less than four dou per mu. According to the current levy rate, the tax is heavy, and each county must pay more than seven dou of grain per mu. The landlords cannot afford to pay, and they will inevitably increase the rent from the tenant farmers. The fertile land is only about three stones of grain for a good harvest, and the barren land is two or three stones. In ancient times, it was called taking one-tenth, but now it is taken to one-fourth or one-third. As a result, both industry and tenant farmers will be exhausted, and the society will not be peaceful. In fact, it is difficult to implement.

### Dance Hostesses Active; Police Bureau Strictly Prohibits

[Our Dispatch] The Municipal Police Bureau has stipulated that dance halls are not allowed to hire dance hostesses, and has summoned the responsible persons of each dance hall to the bureau to inform them to comply. However, most dance halls superficially obey but secretly violate the rules, and dance hostesses are still active. Recently, due to sluggish business, they have even resorted to forcibly "pulling up stages," causing unclear disputes with dancers, and intensifying the exploitation of dance girls. The Administrative Department of the Police Bureau has decided to strictly prohibit them for violating the law and has ordered all subordinate branches to implement it.

### Deputy Director Hu Discusses Business License Tax

[Our Dispatch] The reporter recently interviewed Deputy Director Hu of the Finance Bureau and asked about the bureau's collection of business license tax. He said: The bureau's collection of business license tax is based on the regulations of the central government, and 38 types of industries, such as jewelry, are taxed at a rate of 5 per thousand of their declared capital amount each year. Business licenses are also renewed once a year. Since the opening in mid-May, a total of more than 7,000 businesses have gone to apply for procedures, and more than 6,000 business licenses have been issued so far. The difficulty at present is that some businesses were established before the war, and the amount of capital is very small, which is inconsistent with the actual situation. It would be unreasonable to tax according to this. Moreover, some industries are unable to adjust their capital amount for a while, or have not yet joined the industry association. In such cases, the bureau can only temporarily tax according to the old license fee ratio. At the same time, the bureau sincerely hopes that all industries can automatically adjust their capital amount, so that it can be taxed according to the regulations after being approved. In addition, since accepting the business license matters, the bureau has drafted a kind of business license linkage method. The purpose is to make the review work of each industry still performed separately by the relevant bureaus. For example, the police and health bureaus are also responsible for reviewing and issuing licenses for the barber and bathroom industries within their jurisdiction. In order to unify the license issuance steps, it is proposed that after separate reviews, the Finance Bureau will issue the licenses in a centralized manner. The principle of this method has been decided. As for the technical and detailed regulations, it will be passed and implemented after the Municipal Government Counselor's Office convenes a meeting of the bureaus.

### During the Enemy Puppet Period Murder of Husband Case Accused Woman Zhan Zhou Questioned by High Court Yesterday Story Is Long Past Is Too Painful To Recall

[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhan Zhou (pictured), the perpetrator of the sensational murder of her husband during the enemy-puppet period in Shanghai, was sentenced to death by the then-puppet court, and her appeal was rejected. But before the sentence could be carried out, victory arrived, and the puppet court's judgment was declared invalid. The case was then retried. Zhan Zhou is currently detained in the North Zhejiang Road Detention Center. Yesterday morning, the High Procuratorate dispatched bailiffs to escort her, arriving at the Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison at 11:30 AM. The prosecutor opened an interrogation court to question her, finishing around 12:00 PM, and she was then transferred to the women's prison in Shanghai Prison.

Sentenced to Death after High Court Trial

Zhan Zhou is currently 31 years old, from Danyang. She formerly resided at No. 85, rear building, Lane 432, Yiyuan Lane, Xinchang Road, in this city. Her husband, Zhan Yunying, from Anhui, was a second-hand goods dealer. On the morning of March 20 last year, Zhan Zhou, taking advantage of her husband's sleep, used a kitchen knife to violently hack at his head, neck, lower legs, thighs, upper legs, and lower limbs. Afterward, she dismembered the body into more than ten pieces, placed them in a suitcase, and attempted to destroy the evidence. However, she was discovered by the sub-landlord Wang Xieyang, who reported her to the police and had her arrested. Subsequently, He Damaizi, Xiao Ningbo, and others were implicated as suspected accomplices in adultery, but after the trial by the then-puppet court, the two suspects were found not guilty, while Zhan Zhou was ultimately sentenced to death.

Recalling the Past, Husband Was Not Good

Yesterday, Zhan Zhou wore an old blue short-sleeved cheongsam made of coarse cloth, bare feet in gray striped cloth shoes. Her hair was combed back into two braids, and she held a red plaid handkerchief. The collar was unbuttoned due to the heat, and she was short in stature. After being escorted from the detention center to the Shanghai Prison, after removing the handcuffs, she began by saying "it's a long story" and told the reporter: She was engaged at the age of seventeen and married at the age of twenty-one. Her husband was always out eating, drinking, gambling, and doing whatever he pleased, rarely returning home. When she tried to reason with him, she was beaten and cursed. He also had an affair with a maid outside, who became pregnant, and she took care of it for him. When he was unemployed, they relied entirely on her earnings to make a living. He never knew how to turn back, abandoning his family and continuing to gamble outside, selling off all the furniture.

Describing the Chopping as If Encountering a Ghost

On the night of March 19 last year, he returned home from outside, and they had another argument before going to sleep. Deep into the night, she suddenly woke up with a start. After relieving herself, she took a kitchen knife from the cabinet next to the toilet and hacked violently at the bed. At the time, she only knew that she was chopping at ordinary things, and she didn't know how many times she had chopped. Afterward, it was as if someone was saying in her ear to cut him up, so she did as she was told. It wasn't until she was arrested by the police that she realized what she had done. Now that she thinks about it, she doesn't know how she could have done such a thing. It was truly as if she was possessed by a ghost.

Hearing of Retrial, She Repeatedly Said Thank You

She then told the reporter that while she was in the North Zhejiang Road Detention Center, she was detained with Yuan Meiyun, Wang Guoying, and others, working in the workshop every day, which seemed quite satisfactory. Therefore, when she heard the prosecutor's order to transfer her to the Shanghai Prison yesterday, she asked to do a good deed and asked if she could return to the North Zhejiang Road Detention Center. The bailiff told her that the facilities in the Shanghai Prison women's prison were much better than there, so she stopped saying more. When she heard that the original death sentence had been overturned and there would be a retrial, she smiled and repeatedly said thank you.

The case is now awaiting the High Procuratorate's completion of the investigation and prosecution, after which the High Court can hold a public trial.

They immediately jumped into the water and pulled him up, but he had already drowned. It was later discovered that he had a head injury and was bleeding. According to observations by fellow swimmers, it is believed that when Kang dived into the pool, his head hit the bottom of the pool, causing the injury and death.

The conference has a conference song composed by Cheng Bolu, which all members have practiced and are proficient in. The lyrics are as follows: "More than nine years since we parted from Lushan, its vastness and magnificence are as before. A joyful life and gathering, academic freedom and lectures. Remember the spirit of the Lotus Society and the Deer Cave Rules, the spirit of the Sea Society training, and the meaning of the Gu Town revival. The famous mountain meets, comforting the hardships of eight years of resistance, advancing in virtue and cultivating learning, establishing the foundation for future national construction." Also, Dr. Hu Guangsu gave his first public lecture in the main hall, titled "Analysis of International Politics," which was attended by all members.

It is also heard that the conference will respectfully invite Chairman Jiang to give a speech, and a list of lecturers and members is being prepared for review. Cheng Bolu, in the midst of his busy conference affairs, was inspired to write poetry by the famous mountain meeting.

The moon rises, and the peaks dawn, the old wind comes and the ravines cry, the great road is truly poor, the guest is uniquely good, this body is old, and the official is light, in the middle of the night, I rise to sit and look at the stars, when will the silver river wash the armor?"

### Preferential Treatment for Conscripts' Families; Handled as Usual; Districts Without Grain Reserves May Raise Funds Instead

The Executive Yuan ordered the Municipal Government yesterday: After investigating the preferential treatment for the families of soldiers enlisted to resist the enemy, it should continue to be handled until the enlisted recruits are officially discharged by order. Now, in order to enable all anti-[blank] to obtain practical benefits, and to alleviate the difficulties of local governments in raising grain for preferential treatment, the following five items are stipulated: (1) The preferential treatment for the families of all enlisted recruits should continue to be handled as usual until they are discharged. (2) Those counties (cities) that previously allocated grain from grain reserves to provide for the conscripts' families will continue to provide preferential grain as before. (3) Those counties (cities) that no longer have grain reserves available for allocation should raise funds instead of issuing grain. The amount of funds to be raised should be calculated based on the standard of two shi of yellow grain (wheat) per year for each poverty-stricken conscript's family and each self-sufficient conscript's family, and converted into the corresponding price. (4) Areas that have not established grain reserves at all, or that have grain reserves that cannot be used for other purposes, should still raise funds instead of issuing grain. The amount of funds to be raised should be calculated and priced in accordance with the standard of the previous article. (5) The fundraising methods may be based on the spirit of each province's past practices in raising, managing, and distributing settlement fees for enlisted recruits on their own. The provincial government will formulate a general outline, and each county will formulate detailed implementation rules, submit them to the provincial government for record, and then the provincial government will [blank] actually verify and write off the expenses.

### Questions and Answers on the Household Registration Law (Continued)

(30) Question: In a certain township, a resident named Jia originally has his household registration in Village B and has a spouse. Later, he becomes an adopted son-in-law in Village C and establishes a separate household registration. In this case, one person has two residences in the same jurisdiction, which has the disadvantage of duplication in household registration and statistics. How should this be handled, and where should his rights and obligations belong?

Answer: Article 1002 of the Civil Code stipulates that "an adopted husband-in-law takes the wife's original residence as his own." Therefore, Jia's rights and obligations related to his domicile should be based on his wife's domicile. However, since Jia has a spouse, according to Article 985 of the Civil Code, "a person with a spouse may not commit bigamy." Therefore, his becoming an adopted son-in-law has no legal effect at all, and the establishment of a separate household registration is also without legal basis. For statistical purposes, only Jia's registration in Village B should be used as the basis for exercising his rights and obligations.

### Brief News from Various Districts

The Twelfth District Office previously approved a letter from Shao Yongsheng, the people's representative of the third bao of the district, stating that he was elected as the district's people's representative, and was subsequently elected as an alternate municipal councilor. Now, because the councilor Weng Jianguang has passed away and a vacancy has been created, Yongsheng should legally fill the vacancy, and the district people's representative vacancy left by the succession, should be filled by the alternate elected Wang Qingsun. Please investigate and handle it accordingly. The district office reported the matter to the Municipal Government, which ordered that the case of Shao Yongsheng filling the councilor vacancy left by Weng Jianguang has been submitted to the Ministry of the Interior for review, and should be awaited for further orders. The district people's representative vacancy left by Shao Yongsheng is approved to be filled by Wang Qingsun.

The Eighteenth District Office of this city held a routine meeting for bao chiefs in the district's auditorium at 2:00 PM on the 1st, which was presided over by Deputy District Chief Chang. He listened to the work reports of the bao chiefs on the spot and gave instructions to them separately.

### Answering Mr. Shen's Questions

The Civil Affairs Department recently replied to Mr. Shen: (1) In order to facilitate the people in areas where land registration has not been announced to purchase real estate deeds, the Land Administration Bureau has established a method to entrust the district offices to sell them on its behalf. As to whether the deed needs to be certified by the bao chief, and only after the district office registers it can it be established, please inquire directly with the Land Administration Bureau. (2) The Civil Affairs Department did not issue "Jia" badges.

### Intestine Casings: Cost 1.5 Million, Selling Price 1.4 Million

The export of intestine casings from this city is facing difficulties in large-scale shipment due to the scarcity of vessels heading to New York and Europe. Currently, the cost of producing processed casings from fresh intestines in Shanghai is 1.45 million yuan per barrel. Based on foreign market prices, there is no profit to be made. The industry can barely sustain the livelihoods of workers. Furthermore, according to industry insiders, a recent newspaper article stated the price of fresh intestines at 1.8 million yuan, which is likely a mistake. The market price of ordinary fresh intestines is equivalent to one-quarter of the price of fresh meat, which is 1.25 million yuan per barrel. Adding processing costs of 250,000 yuan, the total cost is 1.5 million yuan. However, the recent American buying price is US$0.55 per piece, which is less than 1.4 million yuan per barrel. If fresh intestines cost as much as 1.8 million yuan, the domestic finished products would cost over 2 million yuan.

### Rice Market: Steady Supply, Japonica and Indica Continue to Decline

Yesterday, the North and South rice markets in the city received a total of over 7,000 *shi* (a unit of dry measure) of rice. The market activity remained stagnant. Fresh rice saw some trading, but medium- and low-grade rice and old stock were difficult to sell, and the situation remained unlikely to improve. High-quality japonica and indica rice continued to decline by more than one yuan, but supplies priced at 100 yuan were scarce, so the price temporarily remained stable. A small amount of newly harvested japonica rice from Pudong was sold for porridge-making. The price of glutinous rice, after several days of sharp decline, showed signs of stabilizing. Wheat flour continued to decline by 100 to 200 yuan due to continued arrivals from Wuxi. Small wheat farmers still picked high prices and took only small quantities. The market softened, and the price fell by 200 to 300 yuan. Although the Ningbo merchants were buying, the demand was not strong, and the supply still exceeded demand. The future trend was still favorable. Northern merchants only picked white wheat, so the transaction was quite few. New supplies of soybeans gradually increased, and sales were sluggish. The price continued to fall by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Old stocks were also reduced by 1,000 yuan because the oil factories were not buying well. Broad beans dropped by 1,000 yuan, sesame seeds fell by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, and peanut kernels were selling poorly, continuing to fall by more than 1,000 yuan. Due to the hot weather, the vegetable oil market saw an increase in sales and improved buying interest. Supplies from Beidao arrived but were not in high demand. Raw oil rebounded by 1,000 yuan. Soybean oil from Shenchang continued to supply. Arrivals from Changzhou and Wuxi also existed. The price trend seemed the same. Soybean cakes sold quite well in rural areas, but autumn will be soon, the application of fertilizer also followed the season, so the price rose by 200 to 300 yuan.

[Our Newspaper Report] The imported rice that this city ordered from Vietnam is arriving at the port in a steady stream. It is estimated that there are 250,000 bags, totaling 25,000 tons. There is still a large amount of Vietnamese rice on the way to Shanghai. The municipal government has decided to sell this imported rice at a subsidized price. All government agencies, public school teachers, company and factory employees in the city can apply for a purchase quota with official documentation. The detailed regulations are currently being drafted by the Grain Section of the Social Affairs Bureau. It is heard that the quantity and price have been decided in principle, admitting two *dou* (a unit of dry measure) per month and half for children. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's *Qimei* ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, carrying more than 5,950 bags of white rice from Wuhu. Now docked at the South Huangpu No. 10 and 11 pontoons to unload.

### Shipping Industry Also Shows Contraction: The Main Reason Is Too High Costs

[Our Newspaper Report] Today's Shanghai shipping industry is shrinking due to the decline in industry and commerce and the weak purchasing power of various regions. Whether it is the shipping industry to various ports along the Yangtze River or the shipping industry operating on inland rivers, they are no longer as prosperous as before. Without government assistance, it is feared that they will follow in the footsteps of general industry and commerce.

Shanghai has always been the most important port of import and export in the country. Native products and raw materials from the interior are concentrated here and transshipped to various ports or exported. Foreign goods from abroad are also transported to the interior from here. The main means of transportation that connect them are the following, in addition to the railway: (1) Ships sailing between ports along the Yangtze River, (2) So-called inland river ships sailing on the Suzhou River and canals, (3) Wooden junks, (4) Motorized junks.

Heavy Losses During the War, Ships Still Have No Cargo

According to qualified shipping industry insiders, before the war, there were about 500,000 ships operating on the Yangtze River ports and along the coast. Their routes included Nanjing, Yunnan, Qingdao, Tianjin, Wenzhou, and Ningbo ports. After the ravages of war, some sank in the river, and some ran to the upper reaches of Yichang and Chongqing, with no news. The total amount of losses is estimated to be more than 300,000 tons. Today, no more than 200,000 tons remain after the disaster. The size of the ships varies from 30 to 400 tons. It is claimed that the number of seats has been sharply reduced, and there is still a "ships with no cargo" phenomenon. Each ship that sails is unable to load fully. And ships sailing downstream from Hankou even return empty. Therefore, current business relies mostly on loading military supplies and relief materials for support. The ratio of commercial goods to military and public transportation is about 1.5 to 3.5. However, because the water freight for military and public transportation is only 60% of the freight for commercial goods, and the price of coal is high, it is almost impossible to maintain.

The Shen-Xi Line is Busier, Other Lines Are Desolate, Next let's talk about inland river ships. Before the war, the main routes were Wuxi, Changshu, Pinghu, Huzhou, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Minhang, Qingpu Zhujiajiao and other lines. Among them, the Shen-Xi line was the busiest, with more than 30 ships. Other routes also had three or four ships each, totaling no less than 50 ships. After the war, it also suffered significant losses. Except for the 32 inland river ships that China Merchants Steam Navigation Company received from the Japanese, the commercial capital companies such as Xie Xing and Lao Gong Mao could not have one or two small steamers of their own. The routes that have now resumed operation include the Shen-Su-Xi line, the Huzhou line, the Pinghu line, the Changshu line, and the Hangzhou line. The goods transported from various places to Shanghai are mostly rice, wheat, and grains, while the goods transported from Shanghai are diesel, cotton, and foreign groceries.

Wages Are Too High, and the Journey Is Too Slow

According to industry insiders, the biggest obstacle to inland river shipping is the ever-increasing wages of sailors. At the same time, due to the lack of tugboats and expensive rental fees, it is already difficult to barely maintain. Moreover, each shipping company has a fixed schedule. Once there are fewer goods, the sailing costs cannot be reduced, which is the main reason for the losses. Taking a 60-ton tugboat (i.e., wooden barge) as an example, the rental fee plus the wages of the boatmen in the autumn of last year was about 250,000 yuan per month. Today, it has risen to 2.35 million yuan per month. Although the freight rate has increased by 30% to 40% in the past three or four months, it is still felt that it is not worth the loss.

Another difficulty for inland river ships is the recent instability of water transportation security. All trips are now overnight, so the journey that originally took only two days and one night has now been extended to more than four days. At the same time, due to the high price of coal, most companies employ diesel ships. Because their machinery is old and slow, extending the sailing time also indirectly increases costs.

Can't Compete with Wooden Junks, Motorized Junks Decline

Competition for inland river ships is also increasing, that is, wooden junks. The current water freight rates are as follows: diesel is 4,000 yuan per barrel, cotton (400 *jin* per bale) is about 7,000 yuan, rice is 2,000 yuan per *shi*, and wheat is 90% of this price. This price is originally about 40% lower than railway transportation, and the wooden junks' water freight is 40% cheaper. The time spent on the way is almost equal. The reason is that the expenses of the wooden junks are lower. Recently, there are nearly 200 wooden junks (boats) from Jiangbei seeking refuge in Shanghai. Each can carry 50 to 60 tons. Under the competition of this type of boat, there is an increasing phenomenon of "many boats and few goods".

As for the motorized junks that once dominated the sea because of the lack of ships at the beginning of the takeover, although there are still nearly 100 ships, they are now gradually declining because they cannot compete with large ships.

### Yarn Market: Very Few Transactions, Spot Cotton Prices Continue to Rise

Yesterday, the yarn market initially rose due to the rise in American cotton. Double Horse brand once rose to 1.35 million, Guangdong merchants folded their arms to wait and see, and merchants intended to sell, so the price returned to 1.325 million. At the end of the market, although the prices of small and medium-sized yarns were shouting up by 10,000 to 20,000, the sales were extremely stagnant, and there were very few transactions. People's minds were no longer as cheerful as the previous day.

Yesterday, the New York American cotton telegraph frequently rose 47 to 64 points, and it is estimated that the recent US dollar is 34.45, the new cotton forward is 31.73, the middling spot is 35.25, and the local spot cotton market is still firm, and the transaction is not lonely. Shenxin No. 2 and No. 5 factories each purchased 300 to 400 bales of white Luo cotton, and the price continued to rise by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan.

There is a slight need for grey cloth from all parties, and the base is tighter. Other piece goods sales are still deserted. As a result, it rose 250 yuan to 500 yuan. At noon, textile mills opened for sale as usual, but the market remained unchanged from the previous period. In the afternoon, the market situation went down.

### Artificial Silk Rises Again: Factory Silk and Silk Goods Are Both Sluggish

Silk fabrics have been dull recently, but artificial silk has been rising day by day. Yesterday, it saw another high of 20,000 yuan. No. 120 Tianqiao bright spot stock was sold at 1.51 million yuan at the close. First the deal did pass 1.5 million yuan. Other brands of semi-bright, except for No. 120, no one cares. In addition to shouting on the original price of the previous day, the rest made 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Yesterday, more than ten boxes were traded in the market, and No. 120 miscellaneous brands with bright were in the majority. Factory silk did not hear of any transaction throughout the day. More than ten packages of open-mouthed warp were transacted due to price shortage. Ordinary mutual responsibility goods are priced between 1.3 million and 1.32 million yuan. Meiya quilt cover remained the same as the day before, Dacheng check crepe still had no transaction, and electricity spinning and Hua Jin crepe and other were no ups and downs.

### New York's Sino-Japanese Silk Market: Japanese Silk Plans to Drop to $3.50: Quality Exceeds 83 Points

[Our Newspaper Report] The report from the Associated Press in New York on the 2nd stated that American silk merchants have begun to compete with Chinese and Japanese raw silk. It also said that Chinese raw silk is only selling for US$8.50 per pound in the open market, while Japanese raw silk is reaching a maximum price of US$16.50. The reporter asked a person in charge of the China Silk Company about this news. He said that the report on the price may not be entirely accurate. According to the current cost of Chinese raw silk, the production of 78-point raw silk would find it impossible to make a profit selling it for US$8.50 per pound in the American market. It is said that it needs to be sold at a price of at least US$10 per pound to cover production costs. As for the price of Japanese raw silk at US$16.50 per pound, it is speculated that it may be a mistake for US$6.50. Recently, Japan has been actively increasing the production of raw silk while studying how to improve quality. The goal is to reduce the price of Japanese silk in the American market to US$3.50 per pound. The current quality standard for Japanese exported raw silk is mostly above 83 points. However, most of our country's raw silk is below 83 points. Therefore, the threat to our country's raw silk in the American market is huge. However, our country's raw silk is not necessarily in a desperate situation from now on. It depends on how our country's silk industry researches a comprehensive cooperation plan to reduce production costs, improve quality, and cooperate with our country's favorable conditions of favorable timing and geographical location. We still hope to compete with raw silk from other countries in the international market.

### Central Bank Pilots Redeposit Discount Method

Since the establishment of the Joint Treasury, the granting of loans by the bank has focused on the trend of the existing credit allocation system. It has made every effort to assist in the production and sales of essential goods for people's livelihoods, hoping to achieve the principle of smooth flow of goods. In order to encourage the promotion of this policy, the Central Bank has piloted the redeposit discount method for the three banks and two bureaus this week. It is understood that manufacturers across the country can apply to local banks for a discount on export goods with bills of lading or insurance policies, and then each bank can reapply to the Central Bank for redeposit discount. The actual amount is 70% off, the term is 15 to 20 days, and the interest rate is a uniform monthly interest rate of two percent. The Central Bank does not temporarily restrict the interest rate charged by the three banks and two bureaus to direct manufacturers, but it hopes that it will not be too high in order to achieve a reasonable level.

### Cotton Imports: Foreign Exchange Cannot Be Purchased Without Prior Approval

The Central Bank issued Circular No. 49 on the 5th, notifying all designated foreign exchange operating banks and cotton importers that the Central Bank has recently reported that some importers have imported cotton without prior review by the Central Bank. Therefore, it reiterates the previous order. All cotton imports that have not been pre-approved by the Central Bank, designated foreign exchange operating banks shall not sell foreign exchange. If designated banks violate this regulation, once verified, they will be subject to the suspension of foreign exchange operations. Importers will be subject to the suspension of foreign exchange purchase applications.

### Second Phase of Subsidized Sugar: Universally Sold from the 8th: Limited to 3 *jin* per Person, 820 Yuan per *jin*

The second phase of subsidized sugar for civil needs, which is responsible for by the South Goods Commercial Association, is ready. The required sugar has been shipped from the designated warehouses in Pudong and stored in the Maochang Refrigerated Warehouse on Yanghang Street, No. 16 Pu. Yesterday, the association notified the designated dealers to ship on August 7, and universal sales will begin on August 8. Sold out in four days, the retail price is 820 yuan per *jin*, and each person is limited to a maximum of 3 *jin*.

### Canada Cancels Restrictions on Sale and Use of Bristle

[Reuters Ottawa, June 6] The Canadian Wartime Prices and Trade Board has announced the removal of restrictions on the sale and use of bristles. However, price controls will continue to be enforced. The Board also stated that if manufacturers revert to manufacturing bristles, their maximum price will be in accordance with the regulations of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board, and their selling price shall not exceed the maximum price. If the goods manufactured by the manufacturer are not the same as the goods that have already been set at the maximum price, they must apply to the Board for setting the maximum price.

### Airfreight Bristles Carried to Australia

[Reuters Sydney, June 6] The Australian News Agency announced that the Australian government recently airlifted bristles worth 1 million pounds sterling from China to Australia. In view of the inconvenience of land and water transportation, the Chinese government has specially permitted Australian aircraft to carry this cargo of great value across Chinese territory.

### Yangquan White Coal Blocks Arrive at 200 Tons

The supply of Yangquan white coal blocks in the coal market has increased relatively. Yesterday, Jiuchang Company transported 200 tons from Tianjin, and the coal *jin* purchased by various colleagues will be shipped one after another in the near future. The buying sentiment is sluggish. Although the sellers are still shouting the original price, the transaction is very few. The United Business Office of coal merchants recently has a large amount of allocation of various types of bituminous coal, so the market is very stable and it is difficult to turn firm for a while.

### Trekking in the Great Gobi: Southern Xinjiang Customs: August 2 Dispatch from Dihua

— Li Shangzhi

While the reporter was in Jiuquan, Gansu, I received an order from the Engineering Office of the New Southern Xinjiang Highway Segment, in Dihua. To speed up the full line construction of the Southern Xinjiang Highway, I was told to assemble a surveying team quickly. Going west from Dunhuang's Yangguan Avenue, to Jijihe which borders Gansu and Xinjiang, we were to survey westward. Last October, I hurriedly prepared for a week in Jiuquan. Leading the entire surveying team, along with all the necessary supplies and equipment, we set off towards Dunhuang.

### Impressions of Dunhuang

I think that people who come to Dunhuang for the first time may have a feeling of monotony and disharmony. A city of less than one kilometer square actually has dozens of temples. Even ordinary residences and shops are almost temple-like. All traffic roads in the city are dirt roads. Only the main road running east-west is paved with lime-soil concrete, but it has been in disrepair for many years and is uneven. The largest transactions in the city are carried out here, which is the essence of the entire city. In fact, all the shops are extremely pitiful in form. It can be said that Dunhuang's commerce has a market but no face.

It is said that in the early autumn of last year, when the Gansu Segment Engineering Office of the Southern Xinjiang Highway (building the Dunhuang to Jijihe section) came here, it caused a major fluctuation in the local area. This was truly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, so prices—especially food—rose along with the greedy line of the merchants. As a result, of course, they made a "nation-building fortune." This time, they heard that we were coming, and with their endless greed, prices soared again. Unfortunately, all our supplies and equipment were prepared in Jiuquan. This was like pouring buckets of cold water on their burning chests, which greatly disappointed them. I remember once at a banquet, the local Chamber of Commerce chairman said to me: "We have 'adjusted' the prices, thinking we could make a lot of money, but you don't buy anything!" At this time, although my heart was filled with indignation, I couldn't give them a severe rebuke due to the environment. I just responded with a faint smile.

### Camel Transport Brigade

Going west from Dunhuang's Yangguan Avenue, towards the border between Gansu and Xinjiang, you are approaching the edge of the Great Gobi Desert. In this area, the only means of transportation is camels, because the highway has just begun construction, and water and fuel are a problem, so cars cannot be used. Also, because the concentrated points of water and grass are very far apart, horses and mules cannot be used in this regard. A certain American highway expert, working as a consultant, said that even with the current equipment in the United States, he would not dare to try to build this desolate highway stretching across the Great Gobi. And we, in order to consolidate the national defense of the border, decided to use this primitive means of transportation to build this modern transportation line. You must know that building a highway in the Gobi Desert is relatively easy. The most important thing is transportation.

The construction of the Gansu segment of the Southern Xinjiang Highway started earlier. When we arrived in Dunhuang, they had almost completed it. The camels they hired were gradually being dismissed and returned to Dunhuang. At that time, most of the camel households were controlled by Zhang. He contracted the camel transport work on the Gansu segment. Of course, he made a profit in the middle. In order to adapt to the speeding up construction plan and seize the opportunity, in fact, we could not sign contracts with individual camel households to handle transportation. We had to negotiate with Zhang. Who knew that he initially said that the geographical environment of Xinjiang was harsh, with no water and grass, and camels could not travel. Later, although he reluctantly agreed to help, he used the trick of raising prices from which he could benefit a great deal. Although we tolerated again and again, we were stuck because the unit price was too high. Here, the author reminds me of many thoughts. Our negotiations with Zhang are not like the negotiations between employers and contractors. We don't seem like government employees. We are simply like people borrowing money from others. We spent a lot of time explaining to him the importance of developing border transportation, thereby improving the cultural level of border residents and consolidating national defense, but he didn't put the interests of the country in his heart at all, except for knowing how to stretch out a hand from the coffin to ask for money desperately. Our humility, tolerance, and tactful explanation were all in vain. If a person's conscience is black, the result will definitely be failure. Zhang tried to raise the unit price on the one hand and lowered the unit price to the camel households on the other. How could this not force the camel households to disperse? And the camel households take camel transport work as a lifelong career, how can they give up this big business? They united automatically and elected representatives to contact us. The real laborers are lovely. They only hope to meet their own living needs without coveting excessive profits. They resolutely accepted our conditions, were willing to go deep into the Great Gobi of Xinjiang to undertake transportation, and accepted the fair unit price we proposed. Under legitimate profits, they felt happy that they had not been exploited.

After nearly two weeks of struggle, the camel transport brigade was organized. At noon on November 25, strong camels, carrying the surveyors, carrying tents, instruments, food, utensils, luggage and all equipment, marched at a slow pace. The two-kilometer-long team gradually drove out of the west gate of Dunhuang, and the sound of camel bells echoed in the vast Gobi Desert.

### Looking at the Ocean West of Dunhuang

After leaving Dunhuang for about fifteen kilometers, it is impossible to see the scattered farmland again. What is presented in front of you is vastness, dimness, and at the edge of the dimness, a calm sky is connected. The camel moves at a slow pace, really what we call "one step three shakes." The person on the camel's back looks far at the up and down moving horizon, like sea waves, like the sky in the ocean, which inevitably evokes endless homesickness. Most of us come from the seaside and have sailing experience. How can this scene not make people miss it! I broke the silence and said to my partner behind me:

"Doctor Zhang, look, that is the ocean, how beautiful!"

"Yes! We are sailing on a 'sand boat'!" He said with emotion.

### Black Wind on the Road

"Roads are made by being trodden on," which is absolutely true. On the vast Gobi Desert, the so-called "roads" are nothing more than the footprints left by caravan traders centuries ago. Subsequent travelers follow the imprints of these steps, heading towards their respective destinations. After thousands of years of trampling, a winding, light gray strip, less than half a meter wide, has been drawn on the dull gray Gobi. If a stranger follows this strip—the "road"—they will always be led to a place with water and grass (though perhaps not their intended destination). If you deviate from it, you will become lost, even dying of thirst in the Gobi. At first, we looked down on this primitive "road," but later, during the surveying process, we realized that even though we carried many precise instruments, the assistance provided by the "road" was undeniable.

People who have lived in northern regions may have heard of the "yellow wind." On the Mongolian Plateau, in areas of yellow sand, fierce gales stir up sandstorms. It is said that these storms can bury entire caravans. In the Gobi Desert, there is the so-called "black wind." Once the wind rises, people cannot be seen within arm's reach, nor can voices be heard from across the way. The entire space becomes dark. Fine gravel strikes from all directions. Sometimes livestock are even swept away by the hurricane to unknown places. If someone without this experience encounters such a situation, they will become panicked and terrified.

One evening, as we were traveling, a hurricane suddenly arose. The cold wind was biting, and the space grew dim. I quickly halted the camel caravan and jumped down. To my surprise, the force of the wind threatened to knock people over. I simply lay down on the ground and ordered the camel leader (who was accustomed to this kind of life) to drag all the companions over to me, gathering us together. I then instructed the camel drivers to use the camels to build a windbreak. Everyone covered their heads with leather coats and slept on the ground.

The nights in the Gobi Desert are extraordinarily desolate, especially when sleeping outdoors. The wind gradually subsided until midnight. I stretched out my head and looked up at the sky. The faint crescent moon appeared and disappeared intermittently, desolate and silent. "Ah, this is also a fragment of life!"

That night, I, like the other companions, could not fall asleep. It was not until the east showed a faint hint of white that everyone jumped up and moved their frozen, numb bodies. The camel drivers, on the other hand, were sound asleep under the camels' bellies. Everyone complained and expressed fear about the ordeal of the previous night. I knew that in such a situation, I could not say anything. I could only urge the camel drivers to wake up and continue onward.

Later, upon inspection, two camels, eight water buckets, and a portion of the supplies were missing.

### Desert Strongholds

After trekking across the Gobi Desert for several days, we would wake up early each day to eat a meal, then set out in a grand procession, traveling about thirty kilometers. By dusk, we would stop to erect yurts, cook, and then go to bed. Every day, life was so monotonous and mechanical, and the air seemed unusually dull.

In the Gobi Desert, a journey of thirty kilometers is called a "station" by the local residents. This is the maximum distance a camel can travel in a day. Each time you set out, you must first understand the number of stations between the nearest water source ahead and the starting point, whether there is firewood along the way. You must bring enough food, water, and firewood (if there is no firewood on the road). Otherwise, even a clever woman cannot cook without firewood and water.

From Dunhuang to Jijitai, where Gansu and Xinjiang meet, the Gobi in this section is densely covered with low-grade plants such as saxaul and ephedra. Unlike the plants in "Jiangnan" (the area south of the Yangtze River), the branches and trunks of these plants are not full of moisture. They cannot be used as fuel unless they are exposed to the sun and dried for many days. However, because there is no rain in the Gobi Desert, the plants are very dry and can be used for cooking as soon as they are picked. Moreover, you do not need any tools to collect firewood. You can just kick it with your foot at the base and pick it up easily. These characteristics are unimaginable to people who have never been to the Gobi Desert. On the 333-kilometer highway from Dunhuang to Jijitai, water can only be obtained in three places: Duobagou, Annanba, and Lapeiquan. The water source at Lapeiquan contains a relatively high amount of salt and is not suitable for drinking. However, when there is no other choice, it can only be replaced with ice, because ice contains less salt than water.

We usually call these places where water and grass gather "strongholds." If we lose these strongholds, we will not be able to survive.

### The Kazakh People

The Kazakhs are one of the fourteen ethnic groups in Xinjiang. They are of the same ethnic group as the people of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic. They believe in Islam, and their language is mutually intelligible with the Uyghur language. They are good at riding and shooting, short and stocky, greedy for small gains, and their cultural level is very low. They still maintain a tribal lifestyle. In the southern Xinjiang area, there are a total of six tribes, namely:

Adu Bayi - Living in Yanchiwan

Shala Haiding - Living in Changcaogou

Husiman - Living in Annanba

Jia Nanboli - Living in Yanchiwan

Habudeli - Living in Haizi

Hussein - Living in Laisi

The places where they live are, of course, the so-called "strongholds in the desert." Their daily life is nomadic and hunting. Their lifestyle is very simple. Each tribe includes a different number of households, depending entirely on the strength of the chief. Each family lives in a yurt. A yurt can accommodate two to four people. The yurt is made of short wooden fences forming a circle, surrounded by felt. A square hole is left, with a felt curtain hanging as a door. Branches are used to build a conical roof, which is still covered with felt. A small circular skylight is left on the top of the cone, which can be opened and closed freely. The ground is mostly covered with felt. At night, people sleep on the ground, using the leather coats they wear during the day as blankets. Their daily food is mainly sheep, camels, and game, with flour as a supplement. Usually, each person has a sharp knife. When eating, they use the knife to cut off a piece of meat, put it on the fire to bake it, and then eat it. The flour is made into "small twists" shaped like goose eggs, one for each person. After eating, they drink a little sheep's milk or domestic scented tea. Their lifestyle, of course, does not emphasize hygiene.

Among the six tribes in southern Xinjiang, the strongest is Hussein, followed by Husiman. Last winter, Hussein even married his daughter to the second son of Husiman. They do not intermarry with other ethnic groups. I remember that in the 31st year of the Republic of China (1942), Soviet engineers came to southern Xinjiang to survey the Southern Xinjiang Highway (the area we were surveying). As a result, all the personnel were shot and killed by Hussein, and all the property was looted. To this day, the surveying instruments they brought are still stored in Hussein's tribe.

This time, everyone took considerable precautions, because we had to pass near the settlements of the other four tribes before reaching Husiman's territory in Annanba. The work area was also in Hussein's territory. Passing through and working in these Kazakh settlements made everyone feel quite uneasy. Moreover, due to transportation difficulties, it was impossible to bring many armed guards. Fortunately, the government personnel stationed on the border negotiated with them and gave them some bonuses every month. Only then did they agree to help build the road (the so-called "help" can only be interpreted as "not disturbing"). Our survey team also hired one Kazakh and one Uyghur translator and two guides to facilitate translation and negotiation, which made everyone feel a little more at ease.

We advanced along the road to Annanba. Because the water supply was running low, we had to send people into the settlement to fetch water urgently. We also sent a companion and a Kazakh translator, along with some tea bricks and white medicine, to Annanba to meet Husiman in order to establish contact. He was very happy and warmly received my representative. The next day, he sent two fast camels and his eldest son to send my representative out, and brought two sheep to see me. It is said that his mother (Husiman's wife) was very ill and hoped that we could send him some medicine. He also said that after his mother recovered, his father would definitely go into the mountains to hunt some game for us, but he hoped that we could give him 200 catties of flour. He also said that Jijitai was all within his territory and asked us to rest assured. If necessary, he could also follow us and do guard work. In order to avoid some unnecessary trouble, I immediately expressed my gratitude for his kindness, and Dr. Zhang selected some useful medicines for him to take back. Later, Husiman did not come to find me until we finished the survey and returned to Dunhuang. At that time, only a small number of construction team members were at Lapeiquan, which startled them.

I think that the border people are not absolutely savage and irrational. It is only because their cultural level is low, their minds are simple, and they are prone to rebellion and being exploited. Furthermore, because they are lazy and poor, it is even easier to cause rebellion. Therefore, in the future, the government's efforts to promote education in the border areas will be a very important issue. This can be incorporated into the department of political construction for border people, and has the same important significance as economic construction in consolidating national defense.

### Ice Nest and Fire

After three days of travel from Annanba, we arrived at Lapeiquan. According to the guide, there was no firewood or water ahead. I had to divide a large number of camels to carry ice and firewood, which would add a lot of difficulties to the surveying work. Because there were quite a few of us, even if the daily water consumption was controlled to the minimum (only for drinking, washing was prohibited), it was impossible to support this long surveying route. Now we had to connect the sections and the transportation distance was so long. The number of camels was limited, and the round trip would be delayed, so it was inevitable that there would be a shortage of firewood and water. In order to cope with this special geographical environment and the current difficulties, I decided to adopt a blitzkrieg tactic, extending the daily working hours as much as possible and advancing the survey at the fastest rate. Therefore, we needed to stay in Lapeiquan for two days to collect firewood and move ice to make full preparations.

Lapeiquan is located in a small ditch next to a mountain valley. The climate is unusually cold, and the north wind howls all day long. Even if you wear a five-inch-long fur coat, you will feel the cold wind biting your bones. When I woke up the next morning, I felt that the quilt was cold and stiff. It turned out that the heat exhaled at night had condensed there and become a thick layer of ice. This can be said to be a miracle for us. Dr. Zhang, who was sleeping next to me, was covering his head and curling up, still not awake. The ice on the quilt was sparkling and shining. I shook him awake and said:

"Hey, you're sleeping in an 'ice nest'! Aren't you getting up yet!"

"Ah, it's so cold!" He suddenly stretched out his head, and the ice began to melt on his face, emitting heat.

On the third day of arriving at Lapeiquan, we advanced to Jijitai and began surveying.

Working at sunrise and returning at sunset, living in tents and sleeping on the ground, we can say that we are living the life of primitive humans.

Life is lonely. Every day after dinner, everyone rested and chatted around the fire in the yurt. This was the only pastime and the only comfort each day. The kerosene was frozen and could not be lit, so we had to use charcoal water for lighting. Under the dim light, we ate, brewed strong tea, and talked. Looking back now, it was quite interesting.

Because we had to make a fire for heating, cooking, and brewing tea, etc., the consumption of firewood exceeded the original budget, and we gradually became panic-stricken. As a last resort, we sent a batch of camels back to Lapeiquan to carry firewood. At this time, we were already more than fifty kilometers away from Lapeiquan, and the round trip would take five days. Adding the distance we advanced during the survey, it would take six days to return. Although we tried our best to conserve, by the fifth night, we had no firewood for cooking. Everyone covered their heads and slept to endure the hunger. The next afternoon, the caravan returned. The two cooks forgot their hunger and shouted and jumped, busy cooking. It was not until the food was fragrant that everyone lazily got up and had a hearty meal.

That night, the wind was very small, and everyone gathered outside the tent to chat around the fire.

There was not a single cloud in the sky, and the bright moon was shining brightly, no different from the moon in our hometown.

Old Lan sat on a stone and sighed. Dr. Zhang said jokingly:

"Old Lan, are you thinking about your cousin again?" Everyone chuckled softly.

"Look how good the moon is, and yet we have to run to the Gobi Desert. If I had married my cousin at home, eaten dinner, and had tea and smoked together while looking at the moon, how comfortable that would be," Old Lan said with a sigh.

"Hmm, so comfortable, you kid is thinking too comfortably." Everyone laughed.

"Hey—the moon is especially good today," another companion said.

The air became quiet again, and everyone looked up at the moving moon, immersed in endless homesickness.

### Returning to Dunhuang

"The water's boiling, come and drink tea!" I deliberately interrupted everyone's homesickness and shouted.

Everyone thoughtfully drank some tea and silently crawled into the yurt to sleep.

Our surveying route crossed several hills, climbed out of several river valleys (rivers with no water), passed through Hongquan, Hongshui, and the Suoerkuli swamp, pointing towards the Jinyan Pass and soon to connect with the western surveying team coming from Bashikaogong.

We worked hard to advance the survey and were only twenty kilometers away from the western surveying team. Through the telescope, we could see their "big flag" and the activities of the surveyors. So I sent a companion to invite their captain to discuss the connection issue.

The next day, the two teams were even closer, and their captain also came. Everyone agreed that we would connect on the hilltop. Everyone was very excited and surveyed down in one go.

That night, we stayed at the connection point. Old Lan instructed the cooks to prepare a particularly rich dinner: preserved meat, sausages, dried fried phoenix chicken, braised mutton, preserved eggs, and pickled vegetables. After the meal, we drank strong black tea.

"Are you going back to Dunhuang tomorrow?" the captain of the western surveying team asked me.

"Yes. What about you?"

"We are also preparing to go back after surveying these few kilometers."

The workers happily raised a pile of firewood, lit a torch, and roared.

A difficult task was completed, and everyone felt both happy and relaxed.

On the way back, we proceeded at the fastest rate. When we reached Hongquan, we met the construction team, who had completed more than thirty kilometers of the route.

"Amama" (Hello everyone - Kazakh language) everyone greeted each other.

They also brought us a lot of letters. It was really "receiving letters from afar brings smiles," and everyone was very happy. I rode on the camel, reading my large bundle of letters while walking, and overheard someone talking behind me.

"Hey—he's smiling, Old Lan, is it from your cousin?"

"No," Old Lan said, smiling.

"You don't have to lie!"

When we arrived at Dunhuang, it was approaching the end of the old lunar year. Every household had pasted bright red spring couplets in front of their doors, making them look so bright and attractive.

### Responding to Readers' Legal Inquiries

(1) Wang Tao asks: In the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936), Mr. Jia purchased a set of furniture from Mr. Yi with a written sales agreement as proof. However, Jia did not pay the stamp duty at the deed tax office because it was not permanent property. Later, Jia returned to his hometown to avoid the war and entrusted Mr. Mou, who lived with him, to take care of it and allowed him to sublet it to others, with the rent as compensation. After the victory, Jia returned from his hometown and sold all the furniture to Bing. Several months later, Ding suddenly came forward and claimed that the furniture belonged to him. After Jia's investigation, he learned that the furniture did belong to Ding ten years ago and was given to Yi as a gift, but Ding did not write a gift agreement to Yi. Now there are several questions, please answer them: (1) If the agreement held by Jia, which has not had stamp duty paid, causes a legal dispute, is it valid? (2) Is it valid if Jia pays the stamp duty again before a dispute arises? (3) If it is invalid, what kind of remedy should Jia take in the future if a dispute arises? (4) Ding has not made any statements to Jia for two years after Jia purchased the goods, nor has he made any statements to the caretaker and the tenant. Now he sees that Jia has sold it at a good price, so he wants to take advantage of the situation to create a dispute. If there are only witnesses and no substantial material evidence, is it legal? (5) If Ding wins in court, who of Jia, Yi, and Bing should be held responsible? But Yi sold it to Jia, and Jia sold it to Bing, and the original object no longer exists. How should it be resolved according to law?

(Lawyer Cao Yaxia answers): (1) A certificate without a stamp tax may be subject to penalties in accordance with the Stamp Tax Law, but it can still be used as a certificate. (2) It is not necessary to pay stamp duty at the deed tax office for the sale and purchase of movable property. (3) Jia should have a way to prove that he legally obtained the purchased object. (4) Witness testimony can also be used as a method of proof. (5) Yi should be responsible for compensating the value of the object equivalent to the original object.

(2) Xu Jizhuang asks: My father has raised four sons. Because he is nearly seventy years old, he knows that there may be disputes in the future, so he specially entrusted his uncle to analyze all the real estate in advance during the puppet organization period last year. The property documents are still in my father's hands. Now I am suffering from lung disease and cannot afford the daily expenses of a family of seven. I want to sell the land under my name to make a living. May I ask if it is legal? Please provide an answer.

(Lawyer Cao Yaxia answers): (1) According to the content of the division agreement, if it is a will or legacy, it will only take effect after death. If it is a gift during his lifetime, then the land is property that cannot be transferred without registration. Before the transfer registration is completed, the gift does not take effect. (2) If it is really impossible to maintain life, then according to the law, the head of the family has the obligation to provide support. You should "maintain the lives of seven people" and never allow the descendants of direct blood relatives to "step into the door of begging" and wait to die from illness.

Is the Examination Method Reasonable?

Editor: I am a civil servant from the interior. For my son's enrollment, I have considered it many times and inquired from various sources before finally finding Guoqiang Middle School on Carter Road a month ago. Because it was for the entrance examination for the third year of junior high, after considerable troublesome registration procedures, on the day the exam was completed, my child came back and said that although the questions were quite difficult, he was confident that he would score at least seventy points, because he often ranked first in Chongqing. Who knew that when the results were posted, he would fail, and out of the hundreds of applicants for the third year of junior high at that school, only one was accepted. We have no objection to the acceptance or rejection, but why does the school only accept one person? Is it appropriate to spend the energy and time of more than a hundred people to recruit one standard student? Secondly, during the oral exam, students were forced to stand in the large playground in the sun. The teachers conducting the exam asked each one very carefully, even asking about the occupations of three generations of ancestors. My poor child did not return home for food until 2 PM after starting at 7 AM, and fell ill after the meal and has not gotten out of bed yet. I wonder if such an oral exam is reasonable? Although the school is known for its strict management, this unreasonable treatment should be improved. In Shanghai, there must be many parents and students suffering from the pain and loss caused by unreasonable exams, so I hope your newspaper will correct this. (Mao Zhichao)

### Considering the Current Traffic Situation

Tricycles and Rickshaws Should Be Restricted Gradually

Reporter: Shanghai is an international metropolis, no doubt. We want to learn from New York and London, but our conditions are far from sufficient. On a personal level, private cars are not so common. They have one car for every four people, while we don't even have one for every thousand. As for public transportation, the buses and trams in Shanghai's urban area are not common enough, and the original routes have too few vehicles. They have three-dimensional traffic facilities, where travel is possible above ground and below ground, but we are still so pitiful with even surface-level traffic! Under these circumstances, how can we learn from New York or London? During the transition period, tricycles and rickshaws are substitutes, and in my opinion, they are still quite necessary. We believe that negative restrictions are not as good as positive development. If cars and trams can become widespread and developed, tricycles and rickshaws will naturally be eliminated. Who wants such outdated things? Negative restrictions may be much more convenient for the one-thousandth (maybe even less) of the car-owning class, but how much inconvenience will it cause for the nine hundred and ninety-nine thousandths of the people? Another aspect that should be considered is that the impact will not only cause a large number of vehicle manufacturing workers to lose their jobs and create social panic, but also create a black market for vehicle licenses. In short, I also agree with the policy of restricting tricycles and rickshaws, but the time is not yet right. (Mao Daren)

Summer Life

### A Water-Collecting Rooftop is Useful Enough - Why Go Far to Escape the Summer Heat?

— Jia Nan

According to my observations, nine out of ten people dislike summer. Just thinking about the blazing sun and the feeling of sweating like rain inevitably brings a sense of irritability.

Of course, wealthy people can go to places with cool climates to escape the summer heat, but ordinary people cannot. As for air conditioning, it has too many drawbacks: First, the installation is complex and not suitable for household use. Second, the difference between indoor and outdoor climates is too great, and it always feels unnatural. Third, it is necessary to keep all the windows and doors tightly closed, which also seems contrary to human nature. Many people are thinking: If there were a simple way to naturally lower the indoor temperature without violating human habits, that would be most ideal.

This ideal has now been realized in the United States. Architect Pullman Luns designed a house not long ago that can make the indoor temperature ten to twelve degrees lower than the outdoor temperature. The method is very simple, and the conditions are: (1) The house must have a flat roof, surrounded by edges, which can collect half an inch of water; (2) The roof must be coated with another layer of asphalt to ensure that it does not leak; (3) Install several lead pipe pistons that can automatically adjust the amount of water collected. If the water exceeds half an inch, it can automatically be discharged.

According to this architect, the water on the roof can reflect the heat from the sunlight, thus making the inside of the house much cooler. Because the roofs of ordinary houses can reach a high heat of one hundred and fifty degrees under sunlight.

However, there are two points that must be paid special attention to when using this type of house: (1) The water on the roof should not be allowed to accumulate debris such as leaves; (2) Insecticides must be used frequently to avoid becoming a breeding ground for mosquitoes and other insects.

To meet the needs, the Meade Wei Company in the United States is already manufacturing a mobile house with a "water-collecting roof" for people to order. Hearing this news in the hot summer is like taking a refreshing medicine.

Of course, according to China's material conditions, Chinese people are not yet qualified to enjoy this kind of good fortune, but this invention is good news for all of humanity. I believe that in five or ten years, China may also build this type of house on a large scale, so that people who are afraid of the heat can have a chance to catch their breath in the long summer. For example, in Shanghai, the summer climate is generally around ninety degrees. If you live in this type of house, the temperature would only be around eighty degrees, which is truly ideal!

### Summer in Luoyang

— Fan Hong

Although summer in Luoyang is cooler than in Bian and Zheng, it is still not as comfortable as the clear breeze and green shade in the surrounding counties. The population is increasing, the traffic is becoming more chaotic, the dust is getting worse, and the climate is becoming more harsh. When it doesn't rain, it's scorching hot, and when it rains, it's muggy. So many of the air raid shelter doors have been opened again. Presumably, the higher-ups in families and the bosses in shops all go down into the shelters at noon to enjoy the leisurely coolness. In the shelters, they are not as frightened as they used to be. They are bold and relaxed, living a comfortable life. There is no need for fans in the shelters, no mosquitoes, flies, or fleas. The shelters are equipped with lounge chairs, sofas, coir beds, candles, small tables, mahjong, ivory tiles, novels, secretaries, orderlies, staff officers, kittens, puppies… and women.

It is a human paradise, not a human hell, even though it is buried deep in the earth several feet below.

But there is laughter and sorrow here! And even deaths!

How do people spend the summer? Peddlers, vendors, and stallholders curse under the scorching sun all day long: A piece of cloth awning blocks the sun, a round cattail fan drives away the sweat, and their eyes are glued to passersby. Their mouths advertise: "Want one? Shanghai goods…" They forget to worry about being seen by acquaintances while they're just walking.

Soda water is displayed at street corners, bottles lined up like memorial tablets in a martyrs' shrine. These are all local goods, many without labels, and the ones that have labels are counterfeiting Shanghai manufacturers. Anyway, customers drink them up quickly, so it's easy to fool them. Dessert shops also add cold snacks like soda water and sour plum soup. These are all sweet drinks that cool the mouth but not the heart. There is no ice at all. It's not that it's not needed, but Luoyang hasn't evolved to that level yet.

People are afraid to walk in the heat, so the hotel business is much more sluggish than before, so sluggish that the porters sleep all day, stretching their legs and gossiping.

Melons and fruits are also on the market, costing between one and two hundred yuan per pound, and quite a few people are eating them.

Flies fill the streets, halls, and rooms, buzzing and making people irritable. This shows that Luoyang is still quite dirty. The people's habit of swatting flies, their attention to daily hygiene, and the government's propaganda and prevention efforts are far inferior to the provincial capital of Kaifeng.

When the Yi Min Station received DDT, Director Li also had a plan to improve the environmental sanitation of Luoyang. He planned to spray DDT in public places and promote a clean-up campaign in conjunction with various agencies to promote public health throughout the city, but this plan was just a pipe dream. Director Li has been transferred to Xuchang Station.

### The Supply Status of Soda Water in Shanghai - An Overview of Watson's, China Pure, Yili, and Central Factories

— Cang Fu

In summer life, soda water should be said to occupy an important position. But having experienced several years of war, people who drink soda water may have thought about the dramatic changes that have occurred in the industry!

The reporter visited several soda water factories. The larger factories said that they are currently constrained by various production conditions, making it difficult for them to operate freely. Smaller factories, on the one hand, feel threatened by the high-quality and low-priced products of the larger factories, and on the other hand, cannot afford the various huge expenses. They are lifeless, and some are planning to close down.

It is said that the soda water season is usually from March to September. Most soda water factories rush to make a profit during this period, and then announce their closure, which leads to the problem of unemployed soda water workers. It was heard recently that there was quite a disturbance about this. However, some factories produce regularly. Among these, the more famous Chinese-owned factory is Watson's, and the foreign-owned factory is China Pure.

In addition to producing its own brands of lemon, sarsaparilla soda, and soda water, as well as Vita Orange, Watson's Soda Water Company also manages the popular "Coca-Cola." "Coca-Cola's" main factory is in the United States, where it has strong financial resources, a large scale, and sophisticated equipment. Combined with extensive advertising, it has established a broad global market. The authorized manufacturer in Shanghai is Watson's Soda Water Company.

According to Watson's Company officials, "Coca-Cola" disappeared in Shanghai after the Pacific War. In the first few months after the victory, the U.S. military shipped a small amount of "Coca-Cola" raw materials. U.S. military officials sent personnel to the company to investigate, and the equipment was deemed qualified, so they continued to entrust the company with the manufacturing. However, the production at that time was limited to the supply for the U.S. military. In recent months, shipping has gradually become smoother, and "Coca-Cola" raw materials have also been arriving one after another, so the supply to the general public has resumed. However, due to the limited number of empty bottles, only 3,000 dozen bottles can be produced each day, which are directly shipped to restaurants, cold drink shops, entertainment venues, etc., which is still not enough to meet the demand. It is said that if they could supply as much as possible, even producing 10,000 dozen bottles per day would not be enough.

As for the raw materials of "Coca-Cola," it is said that they are confidential. They are usually pre-mixed in barrels by the U.S. headquarters and shipped to Shanghai, where they are mixed with appropriate amounts of sugar and filtered water. However, the ingredients and proportions must maintain the same standards as the U.S. headquarters, so a bottle is sampled every week or ten days and sent to the U.S. headquarters for quality testing.

Currently, the production of "Coca-Cola" accounts for 60% of the total production of various Watson's soda waters. At the same time, in order to restore "Coca-Cola's" pre-war market in Shanghai, the ex-factory price per dozen is only 3,000 yuan. However, because the supply and demand are so different, by the time a bottle of "Coca-Cola" reaches the drinker's mouth, the price has more than doubled. Watson's Company is currently adding new machinery to increase production in an effort to solve the problem of maximizing supply.

The foreign-owned China Pure Soda Water Company is so large that it can be said to be the leader in China's soda water industry. However, after the Pacific War, its business was completely shut down. This time, as it reorganizes its operations, it seems to lack its former glory due to the changes in the environment. Therefore, when the reporter visited the company officials, their attitude was very casual. They indicated that they did not want to publicize much. After repeated inquiries by the reporter, it was learned that their products include small bottles of lemon, sarsaparilla soda, and orange soda in 10-liang sizes; soda water in 7-liang and 14-liang sizes; dry ginger ale in 7-liang and 10-liang sizes; and large bottles of lemon soda in 24-liang sizes. In total, they produce about 6,000 dozen bottles per day. In addition, they also have large bottles of distilled water in 5-gallon sizes. Currently, their sales markets include Shanghai and also extend to Hangzhou, Nanjing, Wuxi, and other places.

In addition, Central Soda Water Company can produce about 2,000 to 3,000 bottles of soda water of various sizes per day. Yili Soda Water Company can also produce about 1,000 bottles per day. The average daily output of the other dozen or so small and medium-sized soda water factories is about 1,000 bottles. However, in terms of machinery and equipment, disinfection devices, and product quality, the gap between the large and small factories is too large. It is said that some small factories, because of the soda water season, mostly operate with a speculative attitude. There is no need to talk about disinfection equipment. The empty bottles and bottle caps they use are mostly collected from outside by hired people. At the same time, because the factories depreciate and dump their products, they have no choice but to reduce the production cost by reducing the quality in order to compete with the large factories for short-term gains. However, the cost of competition is the health of all citizens, which is too high. It is hoped that the health authorities will strictly inspect the quality of various soda water beverages to protect the health of all citizens!

Finally, the reporter heard a very realistic statement from the soda water manufacturers. They said in unison to the reporter: "During the eight years of the War of Resistance, the soda water consumption class has shifted from the upper and middle classes to the general working class. Today, the biggest outlet for soda water is no longer the people in long gowns or white-collar workers, but the rickshaw pullers, cart drivers, and various manual laborers who sell their labor! After a long journey or sweating work, they will not hesitate to take out their money and buy a bottle of soda water to drink. However, how many times do people in long gowns and white-collar workers, who earn tens of thousands of yuan a month, taste soda water during the entire summer?..." These words contain so much sadness and so much depression, but it is an ironclad fact. Looking at the changes in the lives of people at all levels through the lifeless soda water industry, the reporter could not help but sigh three times and put down his pen!

### Fireflies Carry Small Lanterns, While Bringing a Weak Light - Summer Insects One

— Shao Hua

"Fireflies, fireflies, fly west, fly east, carrying small lanterns by your side…" When cooling off, the children's loud singing echoes in the night air….

Fireflies carrying small lanterns do not have an important position in the starry night, at most arousing the children's play. And material for adults to talk about (that the ancients borrowed fireflies to read is only a legend!)

On a starless night, night travelers can be more courageous because of them, those who fantasize can enter the kingdom of heaven, and lovers can think of his (her) eyes, with a flame of remembrance lighting up in their hearts, bringing about a recollection of the past. Bringing sweetness, but also bringing pain.

Don't underestimate that faint light!

In the dark night, it will bring light!

### Dragonflies - Summer Insects Two - Breaking the Calm Surface of the Water - Preparing to Receive the Wind and Rain

— Hua

The storm is about to come….

The dark sky makes people feel suffocated, and dark clouds move from afar towards the head. There is no wind, no rain, everything is still, as if frozen.

After a while, there is still no movement….

The reeds are standing straight, and the easily dispersed duckweed are also gathered closely together, waiting for the arrangement of fate. The fish hide at the bottom of the water, not even daring to breathe. The surface of the water is like a mirror that has lost its luster. If it weren't for the swarms of dragonflies flying in the air, one would really suspect that this world had died.

Dragonflies, you are active, active in the time before the storm comes.

Are they sensing the invasion of the storm and want to find a place to settle down? Or are they happily preparing to receive the baptism of this storm?

They fly very quickly, circling in the air, circling… The movement of compound eyes symbolizes the changeable mood, is it fear? Is it joy? Perhaps only they know. After a while, they chase each other, using their tails to randomly dot the surface of the water, temporarily breaking the calm mirror surface. The raindrops are coming, what will become of their fate?

### A Dissection of UNRRA - Special Article from Our Editorial Office

— Jia Nan

The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) and the Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA) are trendy names in the newspapers, appearing almost every day. Everyone knows that countries devastated by war urgently need supplies and technology. UNRRA's responsibility is to implement relief and rehabilitation in liberated countries by providing these necessities. It's only natural that people worldwide are paying close attention and placing great expectations on this organization! Recently, UNRRA's announcement to halt shipments of all industrial and agricultural equipment to China, followed by reactions from various opinions and the rescinding of the suspension order, created a great commotion. Consequently, UNRRA and CNRRA have become topics of discussion both within and outside the government. Given the attention and concern from all sides regarding these two organizations, we believe it necessary to provide a systematic introduction.

First, let's discuss the purpose of establishing UNRRA and CNRRA. According to UNRRA's former Director-General Lehman: World War II was a true world war. The autocracy of the aggressors had extended to approximately thirty-five nations, hundreds of islands, and the homes of over fifty million men, women, and children. The scenes were the same in occupied Europe and enslaved Asia: people were starving, land was barren, and national economies were utterly destroyed. The severity of the situation was unprecedented. If the United Nations, after winning on the battlefield, could not prepare a comprehensive solution to this fragmented situation, to curb death and suffering, and to lay the foundation for lasting peace, it would inevitably lead to the greatest tragedy in history. The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration was born out of this compassionate objective.

On November 9, 1943, forty-four United Nations member states (now increased to fifty-two) and other related countries signed an agreement in Washington to establish UNRRA. Its main purpose was to provide food, clothing, housing, and medical assistance to the liberated peoples, arrange for the repatriation of prisoners and refugees, and assist in restoring urgently needed agricultural and industrial production, progressing from passive relief to active rehabilitation, gradually restoring the economies of various countries to normal. For true prosperity must be built on the prosperity of all nations, as the world is indivisible.

Nations Divided into Three Categories

Countries most deeply wounded and whose economies were most devastated at the end of the war can be divided into three categories. The first category includes France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Norway. Although their territories were occupied, some still possessed colonies, others maintained overseas deposits or held substantial foreign exchange reserves, thus voluntarily remaining outside the scope of international relief. The second category includes Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Greece. Their territories were occupied, and they had no foreign exchange reserves, relying entirely on foreign aid and becoming the initial target for UNRRA relief. The third category includes defeated nations such as Italy, Germany, Japan, Austria, Finland, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria.

To carry out such extensive work, UNRRA's organization is vast. The highest authority of UNRRA is the General Assembly, with each member state sending one representative, convening every six months to determine UNRRA's budget and policies. During the adjournment of the General Assembly, urgent matters are handled by the Central Committee, composed of representatives from the four major powers: the United States, China, Britain, and the Soviet Union. Managing the implementation of policies in each region are two regional committees for the Far East and Europe, further divided into five subcommittees for health, agriculture, industry, welfare, and refugees, each responsible for specific areas.

UNRRA's Finances

As for UNRRA's finances, it is an internationally pooled fund donated by member states that were not invaded. The United States contributed over $1.3 billion, and Britain contributed over $300 million of its own funds... In total, UNRRA has potential assets of $2 billion, used to supply both Europe and Asia. However, according to general estimates, Europe's relief needs amount to $9 billion. Comparing these figures, it is clear that UNRRA cannot solely handle post-war relief and rehabilitation.

Above, we mentioned that countries devastated by war can be divided into three categories. However, besides these, China should be classified as an "intermediate category." Because only half of China's population fell into enemy hands, but the country was divided, fought bitterly for eight years, became utterly impoverished, and urgently needed relief. Roughly in the same situation as China are two Soviet republics, Belarus and Ukraine, which were severely ravaged by the enemy.

China's Needs

According to Chinese estimates, post-war relief and rehabilitation require a total of $2.5 billion USD. Considering the length of China's resistance, the extent of the disaster area, and the severity of the destruction, this amount is actually insufficient. However, UNRRA's total funds amount to only $2 billion, so we cannot expect UNRRA to provide us with more assistance than its total budget. After careful consideration, we could only hope that UNRRA would assist us with $945 million, but UNRRA only approved $562.5 million for us. Based on population, this averages only $1.25 per person, while the average for the Czech Republic is $16.59 per person, Greece $52.45 per person, Albania $22.42 per person, Belarus $3.33 per person, Yugoslavia $27.89 per person, Poland $19.31 per person, and Ukraine $3.13 per person. Even the former enemy countries of Italy and Austria received more than our country. Our representatives strongly argued this point, but the results were unsuccessful.

CNRRA's Organization

As for CNRRA, it is the executive agency established by the Chinese government, with its organization focused on operational aspects, divided into departments, divisions, and offices. The departments include storage and transportation, distribution, finance, and disaster relief, while the divisions include general affairs, accounting, investigation, and translation. The office is the personnel office. Its legal status is completely the same as other ministries and agencies under the Executive Yuan, formally established on January 21, 1945, working closely with UNRRA to carry out relief and rehabilitation tasks in the recovered areas of China.

According to newspaper reports, as of the end of June, UNRRA had unloaded 638,921 tons of goods from 183 large ships, with another 25 ships carrying cargo yet to be unloaded, and 10 more still en route. CNRRA has already transported 335,590 tons of these various supplies to the interior of China. Relief supplies include wheat, milk powder, and other food, trucks, tractors, road construction machines, steel bridges, generators, and flat-bottomed boats, etc.

China's Difficulties

However, the difficulties of transportation within China and the limitations of various material conditions mean that the distribution work may not be entirely satisfactory, leading to misunderstandings by UNRRA. On July 9, UNRRA Director-General Riegner announced the suspension of all UNRRA industrial and agricultural equipment shipments to China, with only essential food such as wheat, rice, grains, and dairy products continuing, but conditioned on the Chinese government quickly clearing the ports and CNRRA distributing the relief supplies to the interior of China in a satisfactory manner. The main reasons for Riegner's abrupt action were said to be two: first, the Chinese government did not provide funding, preventing relief supplies from being quickly distributed to the interior; second, the Chinese government allocated too little to the Communist-controlled areas, thus suspecting the government of using relief supplies as a tool for political struggle.

Regarding this matter, in addition to the Chinese government spokesperson issuing a statement, CNRRA Director-General Chiang Ting-fu has also repeatedly clarified the situation. In fact, CNRRA's distribution of relief supplies has absolutely no political influence involved and is entirely based on local needs and the ease of transportation. This misunderstanding stems entirely from the current transportation difficulties in China. The revocation of the suspension order is, of course, proof that UNRRA has gradually understood the truth of the matter.

Heaven Helps Those Who Help Themselves

Although we still feel that UNRRA's assistance is insufficient in quantity, our heartfelt gratitude cannot be expressed in words. However, one point deserves special attention: UNRRA's relief work will end by next spring. If our country makes no progress by 1947, then the future is bleak, and we will have no one to turn to. Both the government and the people should face this reality squarely. In this world, only those who can save themselves can be saved by others!

UNRRA's Handling of Relief Supplies in China

### France and Italy: From the Yalta Conference to the General Elections

— Translated by Jun Mo from Newsweek Magazine

The general elections in France and Italy have already concluded. To understand their significance clearly, we must first look at their background, which is the shift in official and newspaper opinions in France and Italy during the sixteen months since the Yalta Conference.

A brief review of the past reveals that many misunderstandings between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union today are largely due to the many ambiguous resolutions of the Yalta Conference, each side interpreting them in its own way. However, in the eyes of France and Italy, the Yalta Conference was not ambiguous at all. In their view, the Yalta Conference was a starting point, clearly showing the victorious powers' contempt and coldness towards them.

Before the liberation of France, the de Gaulle government had already begun to eagerly explain France's future foreign policy stance: preventing the resurgence of Germany and ensuring its own security. De Gaulle envisioned the revival of the old mutual assistance alliance, this time with strong military provisions. The first step of this foreign policy was to conclude a treaty of alliance with the Soviet Union. Even the strongly anti-communist factions in France welcomed this alliance, because they felt it could be a start, followed by the expansion of the alliance to Britain, Belgium, and the Netherlands. This treaty system was intended to be consistent with the principles of the United Nations, but most French people openly expressed doubts about the success of the United Nations.

However, this dream of alliance immediately hit a major snag. Initially, the French greatly blamed the Americans for excluding France from the Yalta Conference and the subsequent San Francisco Conference of the Big Three. But gradually, it became clear that France's non-invitation was mainly due to Soviet opposition. Supporters of the Franco-Soviet alliance had to open their eyes and realize that the Russians were far less enthusiastic about this treaty than the French. What seemed like a smooth foreign policy turned out to be stranded as soon as it set sail. And with Britain, there seemed to be no possibility of concluding an alliance because Britain was unwilling to separate the Ruhr and Rhineland areas from Germany, which was exactly the opposite of France's plan. From then on, the only path France wanted to take was the international cooperation that could be found in the United Nations.

The main difference between the situation in Italy and that in France was that Italy encountered an even greater snag, and its hope of finding a way out was even more urgent. On February 10 last year, Italian newspapers reported that Prime Minister Bonomi had requested the Big Three at the Yalta Conference to include Italy in the United Nations. Four days later, the government issued a statement denying it, but the illusion had already spread throughout the country. The reply from the Yalta Big Three to Italy's request was complete indifference. This shattered all beautiful dreams. They had hoped that Italy's contribution to the United Nations' war effort could be recognized as the basis for resolving all past issues.

Since then, Italian public opinion has shifted from resentment to pessimism, and finally to jealousy today. Suspicion has caused France to let the Four Foreign Ministers Conference in Paris end without results, but Italy has not even received this small comfort. The only slight comfort was Secretary of State Byrnes' expression of support for Italy's claim to Trieste.

Therefore, the general background for the general elections in both countries this time is one of widespread disappointment and humiliation. Both countries are trying hard not to be drawn into the whirlpool of the conflict between the great powers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Both countries are only voting on the most important domestic issues: in France, it is choosing a new constitution; in Italy, it is choosing whether to have a monarchy or a republic. At the same time, both countries are also conducting a test to see how the power of the communists and anti-communists is waxing and waning.

However, whether in France or Italy, domestic issues cannot be separated from a larger issue: how to establish their countries' footing in the interconnected European situation. Every clear-headed person has this idea, knowing that their country is inseparable from the rest of the world. But for the French and Italians today, this problem is the most complex and difficult to decide. Obviously, this is the question that was not written on the ballot in the general elections.

### Japanese Women Are Transforming

— Yan Jin, translated from a United Press International special article

Japanese women, who have been enslaved by men for thousands of years, are now, due to Japan's defeat, liberated from this slavery and are preparing to step forward and take responsibility for peace in Asia.

Generally speaking, Japanese women are more knowledgeable than women in any other Asian country. China, of course, also has great women leaders, such as Madame Chiang Kai-shek, but most rural Chinese women are uneducated. The situation is similar in other Asian countries.

Japanese women today clearly see that if they had actively participated in Japanese politics in the first place, the war that led to national destruction might have been avoided. Today, they have clearly seen through the tragedy of this traditional feudal system, which keeps women at home and uninvolved in worldly affairs.

In the past, women were merely domestic slaves, having to serve everyone's daily needs and personal comfort, so they had absolutely no time to be involved in outside activities. As a result, they were not only ignorant of world affairs, but they were also kept in the dark about everything that happened domestically.

The warlords used the so-called "Three Obediences and Four Virtues" "Women's Instruction" to maintain this feudal system...namely the so-called family system...in order to promote their policy of aggression. They believed that Japanese women should blindly obey, and at the same time, they concealed all news unfavorable to their policies.

But all of this has passed with Japan's defeat, and now a new era has begun.

In this general election, Japanese women have shown their enthusiasm and interest in politics. In the general election on April 10, as many as 15,000,000 women participated in the voting.

Before the election, many commentators speculated that most Japanese women were indifferent to politics, so the number of people who abstained from voting in the election might reach 80 percent. But the result? The facts show that only three out of ten people did not go to vote.

The war not only took away their husbands and sons, but also brought unspeakable suffering in family life to women. Food was also very difficult to obtain. Today, due to the lack of farming tools and fertilizers, food is even scarcer than during the war. It is also for this reason that Japanese women are determined not to let another war break out, and will do their best to prevent the next war.

In order to avoid any international conflicts, Asian women should have this responsibility.

Warlords defeated, women liberated.

### Essays   First Star

— Zhongyuan

Have you ever, at a lonely dusk, walked alone into a quiet garden, raised your eyes to the sky, and noticed that first, slightly shimmering little star appearing on the dark horizon?

Perhaps she appears too faint and small, and fleeting.  She cannot, like the bright moon, illuminate you with a stretch of clear, beautiful radiance, gently rippling in the vast high sky, making you marvel, making you linger.  She merely shines a few wisps of faint light alone, then is quickly covered by the other stars that appear one after another; in an instant, you can no longer find her.  However, if you are not a forgetful simpleton, you will never forget this first little star that, with a few faint wisps of light, first illuminated the dark night for you!

The first little star! Yes, in my dim life, there has also been a little star that I can never forget!

Ten years ago, in a certain remote mountain city, in a prestigious, aristocratic old school, I was a lonely, miserable girl.

Like everyone else, when I had just woken up from the golden dreams of childhood, surrounding me were beautiful youth, passionate emotions, and distant hopes. Facing a bright little mirror, I had smiled sincerely at my own blushed cheeks; holding the tender, white hands of my companions, I had felt the most sincere warmth flowing from the bottom of my heart; holding stacks of increasingly thick books, I had entrusted boundless aspirations, endless desires. ... But, as soon as I stepped into the gate of that aristocratic school, my enthusiasm and hope instantly cooled down as if they had met ice!

Ice! Yes, I encountered the coldest, sharpest ice in the world, the snobbish cold eyes!

When I first saw many classmates dressed in silk and wearing gold, looking at my worn-out blue cloth cheongsam with mocking eyes, what surged up in my heart was anger and resistance. I felt that what was there to be ashamed of? I just needed to study hard, to surpass them with excellent grades, to make the teachers value me, and what was there to fear from them?

So, I diligently picked up my books. Morning, quiet night, I buried myself bitterly in piles of difficult books, reading softly, calculating slowly, and carefully reciting again and again what I had read and calculated. I knew that I had exhausted all my ability, and I expected to surpass all my classmates, to vent my anger in front of those who laughed at and looked down on me.

But I was disappointed! At the end of the lively semester, I watched one classmate after another go up to the stage, receiving a glorious medal from the principal, they looked at me proudly, and on their faces, there appeared complacent smiles, as if to say: "Hey! You poor wretch! You stupid worm! You think you can surpass us?"

Pain and darkness pressed down layer upon layer, my anger disappeared, and my courage also disappeared. Like a little lamb lost in the dark night, unable to see a ray of light, only strings of bitter tears kept rolling down from my big, round eyes.

Although I was only an eighteen-year-old girl, I had already begun to curse the length of the years, lamenting the vanity of life. In the midst of a group of lively, happy young ladies, I sat alone with a sullen face, like an old man of seventy or eighty, wasting my days in passive, desolate sighs.

It was a late autumn evening, as usual, there was a patch of cheerful laughter on the grass, classmates were happily jumping and playing, but I alone was pacing back and forth, head down, in a dark corner of the wall.

"They're here! They're here! ... Oh! There's also A-Lu, Little Feng... Should we call them to come together?"

"Good! Good! ... You go and call them quickly! ... Hey! Don't forget to tell everyone to bring a cup to hold cocoa, and don't forget to bring a small knife to peel apples! ..."

After a burst of crisp laughter and shouts subsided, the foot of the small maple tree was filled with bright red cheongsams, soft curls, plump delicate faces, bread, butter, apples! Cocoa... But I, still walked silently, pacing by the dark corner of the wall...

The faint setting sun came and quietly shone on the low wall built of red bricks. I turned my head to the side and saw my own dark shadow, so lonely, so desolate, and finally my tears flowed down again!

"Ah! I am so poor, and so stupid, people look down on me, ignore me, what am I still studying for! I might as well die!"

I painfully tugged at my head, angrily threw the two books clamped under my arm onto the ground, and did not notice that behind me, there was a slender figure slowly walking over.

"Ah! What's making you unhappy, that you're throwing your books away?"

I was startled by that gentle voice. Wiping away the tears from the corners of my eyes, when I raised my head, I saw a round face, a pair of thick glasses, and a row of uneven teeth. ... I recognized her, she was a newly arrived substitute teacher in the elementary school department.

"Oh, thank you..." I saw her pick up the books I had thrown down and put them back into my hand, my face burning, not knowing what to say.

"You're welcome! I often see you walking here alone. You're a high school first-year student, right? Your honorable surname?"

"Yes, I'm in the first year of high school..." I didn't dare to look at her, answering softly,

"My surname is Zhang..."

"Zhang! Then we have the same surname! My surname is also Zhang!" She laughed, suddenly pinching my hand, and said affectionately: "Let's go to that pavilion over there, sit and chat, okay?"

The setting sun gradually moved over, and the evening breeze grew stronger. The small garden behind the dormitory was very quiet, with only a few autumn insects hiding in the grass chirping.

Leaning against her slender figure, sitting silently in the pavilion, my head was still lowered, so I saw clearly the half-new, half-old black cloth-soled shoes on her feet, and in my heart, a kind of inexplicable feeling surged up.

Several rows of white daisies in the garden gave off a faint, elegant fragrance. She took a deep breath and, smiling, looked at me and said:

"This place is so good! It's a real blessing that you study here. Why are you still unhappy and throwing your books on the ground?"

"It is a blessing, but unfortunately..." I gave her a bitter smile, not continuing.

"Unfortunately what?" She brought her head closer to me, asking gently.

"..." I was silent, not daring to answer, but I noticed again the pair of half-old cloth-soled shoes on her feet. I finally said boldly: "I am a poor girl, this place is too aristocratic, I feel pain..."

A rustling gust of wind interrupted my words, tousling my hair. I raised my hand, arranging the short hair that fell on my face, and suddenly realized that she was looking at me, from head to toe, and from toe back to head, she was carefully sizing me up.

"Are you feeling pain because you are poor? Ah! That doesn't matter!" She said with a smile: "When I was studying at the normal school, my clothes often had patches, but I didn't care! Let the classmates ridicule and despise me, let them wear silk and satin, I just concentrated on studying hard!..."

"What you say is true, I initially thought so and did so, but not only am I poor, I am also really too stupid! I have exhausted all my effort, but there is still nothing that I can surpass others in..." I was saying this softly, when she reached out a pair of hands to stop me.

"Surpass others! Why do you want to surpass others?"

"Why do you want to surpass others?" This question was fresh. I had never asked myself, nor had I ever heard anyone ask me. Yet, she asked me.

"I... shouldn't I think this way?" I couldn't answer, looking at her blankly.

"Yes, you shouldn't think this way!" After she answered me calmly and certainly, she took her hand off my shoulder, and said with a slight smile: "Wanting to surpass others is sometimes indeed good, it can encourage people to strive upwards, but most of the time, it increases people's pain and sin; making people jealous, making people disappointed, making people discouraged, even making people depressed and die. I think your pain probably comes from this thought, so I hope you will no longer have this thought..."

Saying this, she lowered her eyes to look at the books in my hand, took away a hardcover geometry book, opened it to a page where the circumference radius was drawn, and said to me, pointing: "You know how to draw a circumference, don't you? As long as there is a radius, whether that radius is a foot, an inch, or a tenth of an inch, you can draw a complete 360-degree circle. I feel that being a person is just like drawing a circle. Although everyone's talent and radius are not the same, with wealth and wisdom, everyone can use their own radius to draw a flawless 360-degree circle. So we don't need to envy other people's wealth and cleverness, nor do we need to think about surpassing others, we only need to do our best, and within the scope of our own ability, we can also achieve a perfect, flawless life..."

Listening to her say these words, my head lifted up, looking at her with joyful and grateful eyes, because I suddenly felt that things were bright in front of me. I also saw the clear blue sky, the beautiful white clouds, the fragrant flowers, the green grass... I also seemed to see, between the blue sky and green grass, a quiet, flat road open for me, I was no longer a lost lamb, I already knew the road I should take...

"Thank you! Your words have enlightened me, I understand, I am really happy! I hope I can talk to you every day!" Urged by the sound of a loud dinner bell as I stepped out of the pavilion, I actually forgot my embarrassment, grabbed her hand, and said with the excitement of a child.

"I also really like to talk to you often, but it's a pity that I'm only here as a substitute, I have other things to take care of elsewhere, so I may leave tomorrow!" She said with a smile, with a somewhat regretful tone.

Sure enough, she left the next day. Perhaps because she was in a hurry, she didn't leave an address, nor did she talk to me again, silently leaving our school; disappearing into the vast sea of people!

Time flies quickly, in the blink of an eye, ten years have quietly passed. In these ten years, I have met many good teachers and helpful friends, and heard countless teachings and encouragements, as if under the dark high sky, a sky full of stars has twinkled, and a bright moon has hung up; but I can never forget her, I can never forget this first little star that first illuminated the dark night for me with a few wisps of faint light!

### Paul Bourget (Continued)

— Xi Shou

When these novels were published, they were criticized a lot by naturalists, because the characters in these novels were mostly taken from upper-class society, and at that time, naturalists almost did not recognize the existence of upper-class society. Bourget focused on depicting all aspects of reality, and he believed that the study of "upper-class society" was also within the scope of novelists' efforts. The reason why he chose upper-class society was because he felt that people in upper-class society did not have much material worry or occupational constraints, and their emotions were particularly unrestrained, making them easier to analyze. Many of his novels, such as *André Cornélis* (1887), *A Woman's Heart* (*Un coeur de femme* 1890), *Cosmopolis* (1893), *A Tragic Idyll* (*Une idylle tragique* 1896), novellas such as *Recommencements* (1897), *Complications Sentimentales* (1898), *The Twists of the Heart* (*Les détours du coeur* 1898), etc., are all works that analyze emotions. But his greatest success was *The Disciple* (*Le disciple*), published in 1889, which was epoch-making in the literary world and in his own works. After this novel came out, the characteristics of his works reached their highest point, and he resolutely stepped out of his groping period. It showed Bourget's greater focus. From then on, he was not only a psychological novelist, but also a moralist who raised the question of the author's spiritual responsibility. This serious tone of a moralist can be seen in the "To a Young Man" written as a preface: "You are looking in the works of us, who are your older brothers, for answers to those questions that are causing you pain... The answers encountered in those works are somewhat related to your spiritual life and your soul; -- your spiritual life is precisely the spiritual life of France; your soul is its soul. Twenty years later, you and your brothers will grasp the lifeline of this old country -- our common mother -- in your hands. You will become the country itself. At that time, in our works, what will you glean, what will you glean? Thinking of this, every upright literary man -- no matter how insignificant he may be -- will tremble because of the great responsibility he bears..." *The Disciple* is a psychological novel that explains a philosophical doctrine, and it is an immortal masterpiece. The content narrates how a young man privately learns from a famous psychologist, and the young man does evil based on scientific methods, and his cold-blooded ruthlessness is appalling. He wanted to use his work to enumerate the sins of aestheticism and materialism in the book, and to raise the banner of idealism. The author's depiction of the state of mind -- especially the state of mind of the present day -- in its structure and changes, is so profound and clear, that we truly feel the superficiality and tastelessness of naturalistic depictions of physiology! He not only attacks the unacceptable cold attitude towards life of naturalism, but also points out the harm of this irresponsible materialistic philosophy to life. After this book came out, his anti-naturalistic and anti-positivistic attitude became clearer, and later became more and more extreme. Enthusiasm for morality turned him into a conservative and Catholic, and this trend became more obvious in his later works. From a sociologist's attitude and a psychologist's observation, he came to the conclusion that social transformation should have a more peaceful order and a more moral life. This order and life should be Christian society. *The Stage* (*L'Étape* 1903), *A Divorce* (*Un divorce* 1904), *The Emigrant* (*L'Émigré* 1907), *The Tribune* (*Le Tribun* 1911, play), *The Demon of Noon* (*Le Démon de midi* 1914), *The Meaning of Death* (*Le Sens de la mort* 1915), *Nemesis* (*Némésis* 1918), and *A Crime in the World* (*Un drame dans le monde* 1929), etc., are all works in which he vigorously promoted the revival of the Catholic Church.

From 1900 to before the First European War, Bourget had a lot of influence in the French literary world and was trusted by young people. Almost everyone in the world read his works. He was simply a leader of young people. But after the European War, he still maintained his original appearance, without any progress or change, just a celebrity, like the other members of the French Academy, unrelated to the world, and in recent years he has almost been forgotten.

Bourget is a literary figure who is good at depicting upper and middle-class society, and he is the first and most authoritative novelist of psychological analysis after Stendhal. He uses patient, slightly clumsy hands to search, describing the state and changes of the mind in detail, lengthily, but powerfully and profoundly. Originally, the complexity of the content and the changes in the mentality of social figures in the late nineteenth century could not be written by anyone other than Bourget with such careful observation and exquisite brushstrokes. Since Stendhal, no one has been able to analyze the inner mind so skillfully. There is no phenomenon in which he does not show us the inner workings. Sometimes he may be a little too delicate, but his intelligence and knowledge are enough to keep our eyes from failing to follow his surgery, layer by layer inward, without feeling burdened. As in *The Disciple*, he uses one hundred and fifty pages to single out a young man, from child to adult, regarding all the environments and forces that cause his psychological abnormality. That kind of precise research is truly astonishing! His novels can truly be described as a document of spiritual history (*Un document d'histoire morale*) as expected by Taine.

Bourget, like Anatole France and Loti, is a writer who straddles two centuries. He spent sixty years of his life immersed in a literary career, was very diligent, and had a prolific output; there are more than sixty books in various styles in total. Among them, the most successful works are no more than the following: (1) Novels: *Cruel Enigma*, *A Love Crime*, *André Cornélis*, *Lies*, *The Disciple*, *A Woman's Heart*, *The Promised Land* (*La Terre promise* 1892), *Cosmopolis*, *A Tragic Idyll*, *The Phantom* (*Le Fantôme* 1901), *Deep Water* (*L'Eau profonde* 1903), *The Stage*, *A Divorce*, *The Emigrant*, *The Demon of Noon*, *The Feeling of Death*, *Laurence Albani* (1919), *Our Actions Follow Us* (*Nos actions nous suivent* 1927), *A Crime in the World*, and *The Judge* (*Le Justicier* 193x), etc. (2) Drama: *The Emigrant* (*L'Émigré* 1908), *A Divorce* (co-edited with A. Cury 1908), *The Barricade* (*La Barricade* 1910), *The Tribune*, *The Time of Peril* (*La Crise*, co-edited with A. Beaunier 1912), etc. (3) Essays and others: *Studies of the Modern Heart*, *New Studies*, *Studies and Portraits*, *Talking about Italy* (*Sensations d'Italie* 1891), *Criticism and Doctrine* (*Pages de critiques et de doctrine* 1912), *Sequel to Criticism and Doctrine* (*Nouvelles pages de critiques et de doctrine* 1922), and *The Duties of Security* (*Au service de l'ordre* 1929), etc. [End]

Tomorrow is Father's Day. For those whose fathers are still alive, may everyone treat it as a birthday; for those whose fathers have already passed away, may everyone treat it as a memorial day. Whether it is a birthday blessing or a memorial day remembrance, the principle of respecting parents—revering kindness and repaying virtue—is the same. A son knows the meaning of thinking of the source when drinking water.

I heard that Hong Shen is rushing to rehearse "Spring Cold" and is very busy. In such hot weather, the old gentleman is still diligently working in his position (drama), which is really admirable. Elder Hong has indeed suffered enough in Chongqing in recent years. To exaggerate a little, he is full of illness—stomach disease, hemorrhoids, neurasthenia, anemia. Although he is a professor and dramatist, these diseases seem to be what a newspaper reporter suffers from. Despite the illness, Elder Hong's spirit is far beyond what young people can achieve. I have not yet met him since coming to Shanghai. I hope that due to environmental and nutritional factors, his health will improve. Honestly speaking, the Chinese drama scene really needs him.

The previous three days were the so-called first wave of heat hitting Shanghai. In northern Jiangsu, (1) near the Grand Canal in Xin'an Town, (2) the North Shu River in Shuyang, (3) near the Grand Canal in Xuzhou, (4) west of Gaoyou River—four places were breached, and the water spread, inundating the area. People in Shanghai are so hot that they don't know what to do. There is a queue in front of the Hongkou swimming pool. For this inundated area in northern Jiangsu, are people envious and want to take a leap?

Yesterday afternoon at eight fifteen, a beggar boy of about ten years old followed me from the Risheng Store all the way to the intersection of Shandong Road. He had patience and perseverance, and I had the same, but he did not fail, because I had already decided not to "encourage evil."

If everyone were so cruel, there would definitely be no beggars on the street. They would definitely find another way to make a living, such as earning a living through labor.

Someone has created the term "clearing out wealth."

Suspecting everything, believing in nothing, what kind of world is this! Terrible, terrible!

### The Story I Love to Tell

— Kan Kan

Tomorrow is August 8th, Father's Day, and I present this story as a tribute to young readers.

At dawn, it was raining. In Litchfield, England, a small bookstore had just opened its doors. Inside, a stooped old man was wrapping books. The old man, weakened by his frail health and unable to bear the burden of work, coughed twice and couldn't continue.

"Samuel!" the old man called softly.

The sturdy young man sitting nearby was reading a book and didn't answer.

"Samuel!" the old man called again, but he still ignored him.

The old man had to wrap the books himself, struggling to place them in a basket. He coughed a few more times and called out a third time, "Samuel!"

Only then did Samuel slowly raise his head and reply, "Father, what is it?"

"Tomorrow is the market day in Exeter, and our book stall needs someone to look after it. But I am extremely exhausted, and it's raining..." the old man said.

Samuel slowly replied, "Yes, seeing this situation, I also feel uncomfortable."

"Perhaps you should let me stay in the shop, and you go to the market!"

However, Samuel kept his head down, reading, and didn't agree.

The old man went outside, looked at the sky. The rain showed no sign of stopping. He put on his coat, took the book basket, and went out coughing.

The rain outside still hadn't stopped.

Fifty years later, on that day, it was again the market day in Exeter, and it was raining.

At this time, a carriage came from Litchfield and stopped in the market square. An old man stepped out of the carriage. He was holding a cane and walked into the market square, panting.

This old man, who had come from a foreign land, walked around for a while and stood in front of a desolate [space], muttering to himself, "Yes, it was here."

He took off his hat, tucked it under his arm, and placed his cane on the ground, standing blankly in the rain.

The clock in the market struck eleven. He remained standing there motionless, the rain pouring down on his head, soaking him through.

At this moment, a brash young man suddenly asked, "Who is this crazy old man?"

"It's Samuel Johnson, the famous English writer. Who doesn't know him?" someone replied.

The clock struck twelve. The strange old man finally looked up at the sky and slowly walked out of the market square to return home.

After Samuel returned home, he said to people, "Fifty years ago, I didn't answer my father's call and didn't serve him. I deeply regret it. Today, I went to Exeter to express my repentance!" After saying this, he wept bitterly.

The rain outside still hadn't stopped.

### Safety First

— Chong Zheng

According to reliable statistics from the police department last month, there were as many as 283 automobile accidents. On average, more than nine accidents occur every day. Regardless of whether each accident resulted in someone being killed or injured, this phenomenon makes everyone feel unsafe!

If this continues, the roads are indeed more dangerous than a tiger's mouth.

Suppose a good person wasn't killed by the enemy on the front lines or bombed by airplanes in the rear during the eight years of the war of resistance, and today, with the war won and returning in triumph, they pointlessly lose their life under the wheels of a car, being bloodily crushed to death on the road, isn't that too unjust?

For the life security of all 3.7 million citizens of Shanghai, we must loudly appeal to the authorities in charge of directing and managing traffic in this city to earnestly pay attention to this serious problem and quickly come up with proper solutions!

Life is at stake, not a small matter!

### Parasol Show

Workers' entertainment is always a concern for entrepreneurs, but the owner of the Japanese Mikimoto Pearl Company has come up with something special. The eighty-seven-year-old businessman, Mikimoto himself, sleeps bare-chested on a bed, turning over on his back, and uses his feet to perform a parasol show. The female workers watch, and everyone is happy. It is said that this has reduced labor disputes in the company.

### Such a Wife, Such a Home

— Qing Yan

In an old-fashioned tenement house, the protagonist is a short man in his thirties, silent and taciturn. Every morning, he rides his bicycle to the office and returns at five o'clock. He embraces the principle of spending no money, so he doesn't smoke, drink, gamble, play chess, read, exercise, or donate. He doesn't even go to movies, plays, or parks. He doesn't care about the actions of his wife, children, and servants within his family. No matter how chaotic things get, he remains oblivious. His only life is being an office worker, earning a salary, and engaging in petty speculation. He simply has no outlook on life. His wife is about the same age, well-built, and has a loud voice. Her specialty is mahjong. She can start a game early in the morning and play until the next day. She is familiar with "one-bar high," "green dragon," "joker," and "temple melon" early in the morning. As long as she sits at the mahjong table with a tile in hand, everything else ceases to matter. Whether it's a cold winter snow, a hot summer, firewood, rice, oil, salt, children crying, wind, rain, thunder, or lightning, nothing can shake her passion for mahjong. If an atomic bomb were tested in Shanghai, she could be as calm as a goat grazing on Bikini Island. Her children are dressed in rags, covered in dirt, and tuition fees are too high, so they have stopped going to school. They kick balls and fight in the house, and a scratchy radio is turned on with ghostly howls, playing endless, lengthy advertisements with low-level humorous Shanghai opera and Yue opera. They have an appetite for listening to what pill is sold at a certain number on a certain street at a certain mansion, or what powder is sold at a certain young lady's place. The tranquil air of the neighborhood becomes like a chaotic variety show or a store's grand sale. Her maid's deafening voice, from morning to night, is either laughing, shouting, or scolding, truly causing chaos and disruption. Under all these circumstances, the protagonist slowly and methodically wipes his bicycle or sits in the room, staring blankly. The sound of mahjong, the sound of the radio, the sound of laughter, the sound of scolding, the sound of crying, the sound of noise, the sound of fighting—none of these evoke even the slightest feeling in him. Alas, such a family!

### Grievances

— Zuo Po

Elementary school students bow to the teacher.

Middle school students nod to the teacher.

College students wait for the teacher to greet them first before returning the greeting.

Students studying abroad expect the teacher to bow to them first.

Going to school to get a diploma is like going to a company to buy something, only getting a receipt.

### Tutoring

— Xiao Jizhang

Last Sunday, several classmates came to visit. Because many hadn't seen each other for a while, we couldn't help but chat and laugh, exchanging recent updates. From the conversation, I learned that they had recently hired a tutor who would meet with them on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays to tutor them in English. As they were leaving, they kindly asked me to go to their place tomorrow afternoon to listen to the lecture and even hoped that I would join them!

The next day, because of the prior engagement, I had to brave the heat and rush over. I probably arrived a bit too early. The tutor hadn't arrived yet, and my classmates were all gathered around a table playing Russian Pai Gow. I had no interest in this, so I had to sit quietly on the side, reading the newspaper to pass the time!

After about an hour, the tutor finally arrived late, with a short, stout body and wearing a Hong Kong-style suit. He looked very comical. If you didn't say so, no one would believe he was a teacher; they might even suspect he was a salesman from a foreign company!

Logically, when the teacher arrives, everyone should clean up the mess. However, my classmates were having too much fun to stop first. While they continued their work, they told the teacher to lie down on the bed and rest for a while, allowing them to play one more round before tutoring. The teacher was very good at catering to their psychology, telling them not to be impatient and to play slowly, while his body slowly fell onto the bed, really closing his eyes to rest!

With great difficulty, they stopped playing, and the teacher had also rested enough. Then they began tutoring. Next to the table were placed watermelon, soda, and other summer cold drinks. They ate and taught, and their appearance was still considered serious. After the cold drinks were finished, their attitude became lax. In the end, they simply closed their books, and everyone began to chat, talking about everything under the sun. Time passed quickly, and the tutor picked up his straw hat and swaggered out the door.

I originally wanted to join them in tutoring, but after seeing this, I would rather take a nap at home than run around in the streets in the hot weather and suffer.

Such tutoring deceives oneself and makes things difficult for the father!
