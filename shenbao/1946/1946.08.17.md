### Marshal Ma Visited the Chairman Last Night to Discuss Appropriate Measures for Handling the Current Situation

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Guling, 16th] Marshal Ma paid his first visit to the Chairman at 6:00 PM on the 16th, after arriving on the mountain. Premier Song also arrived ten minutes later to participate in the talks and had dinner with the Chairman. However, no details of his conversation with the Chairman were disclosed. According to general speculation here, Marshal Ma has made great efforts and rendered services in the past few months for the peaceful future of China, but the Yan'an broadcast on the 13th clearly rejected Marshal Ma's mediation. However, Chairman Chiang's August 14th communique clarified that the government still holds out hope for peace talks and hopes that Marshal Ma can continue his efforts to complete his mission. Therefore, it is believed that Marshal Ma's conversation with the Chairman may have discussed a more appropriate method to break the current deadlock and make a final decision on how to handle the current situation. Furthermore, Marshal Ma's residence denied on the 16th the rumors that Marshal Ma brought a letter from Zhou Enlai to Chairman Chiang, and stated: If Zhou has anything to express, he can announce it publicly. Marshal Ma plans to stay here for three or four days before returning to Nanjing.

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Nanjing, 16th] A Communist Party spokesperson admitted yesterday that Zhou Enlai had orally presented his opinions on the Chairman's communique to Marshal Ma, but denied that he had entrusted him with written documents for delivery, and stated that the content was not yet ready for publication. According to the Communist Party, the Chairman's communique has pushed the current situation into a new stage. Their demand is an immediate ceasefire and the reopening of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC), but they said they were not interested in expanding the foundation of the government. At the same time, they showed no sign of compromise on the withdrawal of troops from northern Jiangsu and other places. It is reported that Marshal Ma's recent peace efforts only relayed the opinions of both sides, without participating in the opinions of third parties or proposing compromise solutions. It is claimed that the gap between the opinions of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in political negotiations is too large to be reconciled.

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Nanjing, 16th] According to tonight's news, the Communist Party has completed its research on Chairman Chiang's published communique and plans to make a statement at a press conference on the 17th.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 16th] Zhou Enlai is revising his statement on the current situation behind closed doors today. It is expected that its content will answer Chairman Chiang's accusations against the CCP in his communique and clarify the opinions that the Communist Party has not formally expressed before.

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Beiping, 16th] This reporter has just learned from the Communist Party that when Marshal Ma met with Zhou Enlai, Robertson, and Ye Jianying yesterday morning, he asked Zhou Enlai for his opinion on Chairman Chiang's communique. Zhou reportedly expressed his hope that Marshal Ma would continue his efforts to seek peace and reiterated the unconditional ceasefire and the reorganization of the government based on the resolutions of the PCC. Marshal Ma inquired about Zhou's new opinions on the issue of local governments after the adjustment of the military's garrison areas. Zhou then supplemented his previous opinions, saying that according to the military reorganization plan, all troops should be sent to designated locations for centralized training (including both KMT and Communist forces), and the remaining local governments should be formed according to democratic principles and should not be changed.

### Lushan Talk Conference: A Timely Measure to Clarify the Situation; Communist Party and Democratic League Express Opposition

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Guling, 16th] According to a certain neutral person, the Lushan Talk Conference that "appeals to the conscience of the people" is actually the only countermeasure to clarify the current situation and resolve domestic disputes. Now that all conscientious people in China unanimously advocate opposition to international interference and welcome the people's preliminary discussions on political affairs, decisive measures should be taken to accept the people's demands and convene representatives of various parties, factions, social elites, and leading figures in the cultural and educational circles from various regions to Lushan as soon as possible to discuss national affairs. This is a wise measure at the right time and in the right place. As for the rumors that the Communist Party opposes the convening of this talk conference, it is within expectations, because the Communist Party is a self-inferior element that first advocated international interference, and it should have this abnormal argument. In addition, a certain neutral person also talked about Luo Longji's strange arguments that misinterpreted Chairman Chiang's communique the other day, believing that it was not surprising at all, because Luo Longji advocated nine years ago the organization of another government in North China under Japanese control in order to "make a difference" (see the Central Daily News Lushan edition, the article "Guling Nine Years Ago"). The person is like this, so his arguments are not surprising.

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Nanjing, 16th] The Communist Party and the Democratic League have expressed their firm opposition to the Lushan Talk Conference, and the reasons they hold are exactly the same. Liao Chengzhi of the Communist Party said: "The convening of the Lushan Talk Conference is the death knell of the PCC." Luo Longji said: "Opening another talk conference is equivalent to overturning the resolutions of the PCC. The PCC, which includes representatives from all parties, cannot solve the problem. The resolutions of the talk conference controlled by the government will be even less effective. At present, only the implementation of the PCC resolutions can alleviate the seriousness of the situation." Luo's remarks today still showed anxiety about the current situation, but he did not directly point out the actual responsibility for the failure to implement the PCC resolutions. Furthermore, Luo Longji visited Shao Lizi at the参政会 at 10:00 AM on the 16th, asking him to convey the opposition to convening the Lushan Talk Conference to the authorities.

### Zhu Jiahua and Wang Yunwu Arrive in Guling Together from Nanjing

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Guling, 16th] Zhu Jiahua and Wang Yunwu arrived in Guling together from Nanjing at 6:30 PM on the 16th. Zhang Zhenyi, the executive director of the Women's Guidance Committee, also arrived in Guling today.

[Central News Agency, Guling, 16th] Mr. Zhu Jiahua issued a written statement today in response to reporters' inquiries in Guling about the rumors of the Lushan Talk Conference, saying: This trip to the mountain is to report to the Chairman on the recent general education administration and the restoration of various universities. The Chairman has always been very concerned about the principals and professors of various universities. At this time, the schools are resuming their operations, and the principals and professors are passing through Nanjing one after another. I heard that he intends to invite them separately to come up the mountain and inquire about everything. Furthermore, I heard that the Chairman has this plan and may have the opportunity to realize it recently. As for the rumored talk conference, I know nothing about it.

### CCP Criticizes Marshal Ma, Obviously with Ulterior Motives

[United Press, Nanjing, 15th] The Yan'an 解放日报's editorial criticizing Special Envoy Marshall yesterday is not comparable to ordinary newspaper commentary. This argument may be a manifestation of the CCP's adoption of a new line, or it may be a prelude to denying Marshall's role as mediator. If Moscow follows suit with any action or makes a public statement, it would not be surprising. This reporter recently inspected Harbin, which is under the jurisdiction of the Communist Party, for two weeks and knows that the arguments in the newspapers run by the local Communist Party are often based on TASS or Russian newspapers. The commentary in the Yan'an 解放日报 this time may not be an exception. It is already rumored in the Northeast Communist Party-controlled area that the Soviet Union will be encouraged to participate in the mediation of the KMT-Communist dispute, or that a Soviet representative will be added to the KMT, Communist, and American representatives in the Executive Headquarters. Considering that Marshall is a sincere friend who cares for Yan'an, and Nanjing's discussion also recognizes his greatest patience, it is a big mistake for the 解放日报 to not hesitate to slap him in the face to vent its anger.

[United Press, Nanjing, 16th] After Yan'an newspapers criticized Special Envoy Marshall yesterday, the CCP's Xinhua News Agency today once again wantonly scolded Chairman Chiang and the National Government.

### US Senator Advocates That US Troops Remain in China

[Associated Press, Washington, 16th] Senator Brewster, who recently returned from an inspection of China, Japan, and the Philippines, today urged President Truman to keep US troops stationed in China to prevent the expansion of Soviet influence. He said: If US troops withdraw, a country that is "less concerned about China's future" will invade. Brewster told the President that Soviet spies are freely active in Japan, and there are 500 Soviet propaganda personnel active in Tokyo alone, and their work is diplomatically protected and unobstructed through the Soviet Embassy. Soviet influence is extremely significant throughout the Far East, and Marshal MacArthur is also aware of this.

### US Newspapers Praise Chairman's Communique, Comparing it to Lincoln's Call for Peace; Demand That the Government Continue Economic Aid to China

[US News Agency, Washington, 15th] When answering questions, a State Department spokesperson said: The State Department has paid close attention to the reaction of the CCP to Chairman Chiang's communique on the victory over Japan, which called for an end to one-party rule.

[Central News Agency, New York, 15th] Scripps Howard, the world's telegram evening newspaper, called for a firmer policy toward China, urging the US government to endorse Chairman Chiang's peace plan, continue economic aid to the central government, and stop appeasing the CCP. It said: "If we want to save China from danger, the US government needs to take a firm stand. We cannot continue to go against our word. Our appeasement of the Communist Party and our insistence that Chairman Chiang include the Communist Party in his government have made a bad situation worse. China cannot be half slave and half free. It cannot be a government that is half Communist and half constitutional. To end the current deadlock, the US government only needs to issue a statement immediately endorsing Chairman Chiang's call for peace, continuing to provide economic aid to his government, and clearly stating that aid to China will only be provided to its government." The above commentary was made because the newspaper was inspired by Chairman Chiang's victory anniversary communique and compared it to Lincoln's call for peace 86 years ago. The World Telegram also said: Chairman Chiang's statement may not end the domestic conflict as a result, just like Lincoln's statement, but the principles proclaimed by the two declarations are as sound today as they were 86 years ago. The newspaper continued: The person who led China's war of resistance for eight years and succeeded, when he declared that no government in the world can evade its responsibility to maintain order and protect the lives of the people, his position is as firm as it was eight years ago.

### Rumor Has It That the US and the Soviet Union Signed a Secret Agreement at the Potsdam Conference; Stalin Actually Proposed to Divide Our Country

[Special Correspondent of This Newspaper in Washington, 15th] The Yalta Secret Agreement has long caused a sensation in the world. The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance is almost a natural product of the Yalta Secret Agreement. Unexpectedly, in the past ten days, Washington and New York have suddenly been rife with rumors that the three major powers of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union also had a secret agreement on the Far East at the Potsdam Conference last year, which is almost the same as the Yalta Secret Agreement. US officials have not yet made a formal statement on this rumor. Recently, Coleber, Executive Committee Member of the US China Policy Association, wrote to Acting Secretary of State Acheson, saying: "At the Potsdam Conference, Stalin made a request, initially wanting to divide China. Truman and Byrnes then retreated and signed a relatively milder secret agreement, believing that there was nothing else to do. It is heard that its content is: (1) Outer Mongolia's independence, (2) Division of Korea, (3) Recognition of the Soviet Union's acquisition of more compensation in the Northeast, (4) Forcing the Chinese government to include the Communist Party in a coalition government, but not to disband or unify the Communist army; (5) If the pressure exerted by the United States cannot achieve the 134 points, then the Soviet Union can act alone, etc." Coleber asked Acheson to pay attention to the above unsubstantiated news, saying that whether to confirm or deny it, publishing the full text of the Potsdam Agreement can dispel the doubts of the world.

### Zhang Fakui Flies to Hong Kong for a Return Visit

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th] Zhang Fakui and his wife flew to Hong Kong by special plane at 9:04 AM on the 16th to return the visit of the Hong Kong Governor to Guangzhou.

### Disputes Should Be Resolved on Our Own; Why Seek Help from Neighboring Countries? - A Correct Argument from the 大美晚报 (Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury) -

[From This City] The English 大美晚报's editorial on the 15th said: Whether submitting China's internal difficulties to the United Nations agencies will benefit the Communist Party's position in the KMT-Communist dispute or the general situation seems to be extremely problematic in our American eyes. This is not because we are an American newspaper that we say this. One of the important reasons the Communist Party has put forward for appealing to the United Nations agencies is clearly directed at the United States' "military aid to the National Government," but this does not affect the newspaper's position. It is healthier to examine the whole problem frankly and quickly than to constantly hem and haw and express vague dissatisfaction. In fact, US Senator Pepper agrees with this view. On the US government's side, this method may also be helpful in further determining the US response policy. However, in general, complicating the situation is not a solution. The more complicated the problem and responsibility, the more outside parties are involved, and the greater the possibility that the difficult problem will continue to be delayed.

The urgent task at hand is to solve the problem, not to have more and more disputes. The best way to solve the problem is to limit the number of participants in the discussion, not to expand it. This seems to us to be common sense.

Of course, on the other hand, it must be admitted that the longer this difficult situation drags on, the greater the possibility of involving outside parties, and the more complicated the situation will become. Perhaps General Marshall and Ambassador Stuart have both thought of this. They have made it clear that they have no intention of abruptly ending the peace efforts. The statement issued last weekend can only be regarded as a notification, that is, there is a limit to everything. All that any third party can do is offer friendly advice. Obviously, we Americans are in a difficult situation in this matter, because if this matter is presented to the United Nations, we are a party related to this matter, then complaints may also be added to us. But to avoid suspicion, honesty is the most necessary, and this is our honest opinion, believing that both the KMT and the Communist Party should concentrate their efforts and try to solve the dispute on their own, instead of spreading these things everywhere and asking neighboring countries to come forward and take over.

Outside rumors say that they are trying to "inquire about the British attitude towards the current situation." This is actually equally meaningless. All Chinese political parties can believe that the attitudes of Britain and the United States towards China can be said to be no significantly different. They do not harbor any malice towards China. They only hope that China can have peace and unity, and they hope for China's political and economic recovery.

This, I believe, is also the attitude of all other friendly powers. Although it is difficult to say exactly what the Soviet Union's attitude is, because after the victory, the Soviet Union is pursuing an excessive nationalist policy to strengthen the Soviet Union and seek a zone of friendly neighboring countries around it. But this is not what (as generally accused) "the revival of Tsarist imperialist policy" is. This is clearly very different from the attitude of other allied countries, and this matter is still not very clear. Although there are these annoying facts, such as the Soviet Union's removal of industrial equipment from the Northeast, and the rumors of secret Soviet military agreements with Outer Mongolia and the CCP, we feel that the Soviet Union will definitely take a realistic attitude towards a reviving and powerful China, just as it took a realistic attitude towards a weak China.

From the standpoint of both the KMT and the Communist Party, a unified China should be established. To achieve this goal, we repeat a sentence, we should not spread these scandals and beg for help from all sides, but should bear the responsibility of revival ourselves. There is no other way to follow. Anything else will only delay that final reconciliation and recovery that will inevitably come.

### Establish a Liaison Group First to Investigate the Anping Incident

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Beiping, 16th] The 25-member group investigating the Anping incident decided on the morning of the 16th: (1) The three parties will take turns as chairman, starting today. The order is: first the US, second the government, and third the Communist Party. Each chairman will be responsible for two days. (2) Each of the three parties will send two people to form a liaison group to first contact the Communist Party headquarters to facilitate the group's future visits to various places to listen to reports. The meeting continued in the afternoon. Huang Yifeng said: The Communist Party received telegrams from the local Communist army, and the liaison group should depart along the Tongzhou-Xianghe route. After a dispute, it was passed. The liaison group will depart on the morning of the 17th, and the 25-member group will remain in Beiping on the 17th to listen to the US report.

### Consider Readjusting the Treatment of Public School Personnel Again

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Nanjing, 16th] After the treatment of civil servants began to be adjusted this month, the general feeling is that it is too focused on the added multiple, which makes the most numerous low-level civil servants still trapped in heavy living pressure. The competent authorities have also paid attention to this and are considering readjusting again. It is heard that the standard for the Nanjing-Shanghai area may be a basic number of 180,000, with an added multiple of 500.

### The Focus of the Executive Yuan's Governance is on Restoring Transportation and Relieving Disaster Victims; Premier Song is Scheduled to Return to Nanjing from Guling Today

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Guling, 16th] Premier Song Ziwen met with Chief of Staff Chen Cheng at his private residence for about an hour in the morning of the 16th. He received reporters at 10:30 AM and answered various questions. Regarding the Chairman convening people from all walks of life in Guling for informal talks, Song said he had heard about it and expressed his full support, but he was afraid that he would not be able to participate at the time due to his busy official duties in Nanjing. Song also reported that the Executive Yuan's recent administration is focused on restoring transportation and relieving disaster victims in northern Jiangsu and other places. On the financial side, it is not yet possible to predict whether the amount of issuance in August will increase. The recent good harvests in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Sichuan, and Hubei have been of great help to finance. Song is scheduled to come to Guling every two weeks thereafter to meet with the Chairman and report on government affairs. Song was originally scheduled to go down the mountain on the 16th, but due to the Chairman's important matters for consultation, he changed to going down the mountain at 7:00 AM on the 17th to return to Nanjing. Those traveling with him included Chief of Staff Chen Cheng, Minister of Education Jiang Jingguo, Deputy Director of the Central Propaganda Department Bell, and Lu Qixin. Chen and Jiang will come to Guling again before the beginning of next month to attend the Second National Congress of the Youth Corps.

[Central News Agency, Guling, 16th] The Guling reporters interviewed Premier Song in batches at his private residence and were warmly received. Song answered all the questions raised as fully as possible. The main points are as follows: (1) The current measures of the Executive Yuan focus on restoring transportation and relieving disasters. (2) The widespread good harvest across the country this year will help improve the government's economic policies. (3) The 法币 has not increased the amount of issuance since July, and I hope that this excellent result can be maintained.

### Datong National Army Fights Courageously and Blocks; Communist Army Attacks Repeatedly and Suffers Setbacks, Showing Signs of Exhaustion

[Central News Agency, Datong, 16th] Since August 2nd, the Communist army has gathered its full strength to launch a large-scale siege of Datong. In the past ten days or so, after the defending army fought bravely and blocked the attack, they have suffered repeated setbacks and are now showing signs of exhaustion.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 16th] After the Communist army, under the command of Yao Zhe, captured Huairen on August 3 with a force of more than 50,000 troops in 30 regiments, they took a surrounding position against Datong, and set August 16 as the date for a general attack. This contradicts what the Communist Party spokesperson of the Beiping Executive Headquarters told the 益世报 on July 16 that they would not attack Datong. Zhou Enlai also made a similar statement in Nanjing a few days ago. The CCP's capricious and insidious tricks are well known to the people of the country.

### The Communist Army Fiercely Attacks the Eastern Section of the Longhai Railway; Dangshan and Following Lanfeng are Occupied; Communist Troops in Northern Jiangsu are Collapsing Towards the Northeast

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Communist forces are concentrated in the area north of the Xuzhou to Kaifeng section of the Longhai Railway. On the 5th of this month, our correspondent quoted a military official in a special dispatch, pointing out that a major battle in Dangshan was imminent. On the morning of the 8th, the Communist army, indeed, launched a fierce attack on the Xuzhou to Kaifeng section of the Longhai Railway with twenty-seven regiments. After Dangshan and Lanfeng successively fell, Xuzhou and Kaifeng feel seriously threatened. The Communist army's intention seems to be to control the entire Longhai Railway, creating a situation of north-south division.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Beiping, 16th] According to military news, towns east of Kaifeng and west of Xuzhou along the Longhai Railway, with the exception of Yucheng, which is still firmly defended by the National Army, have almost all been captured by the Communist army. It is reported that on the 10th, over 100,000 troops gathered from Heze, Dongming, Dingtao, Caoxian, Shanxian, and other places, under the command of Liu Bocheng (some say Nie Rongzhen), launched an attack that night on stations such as Yucheng, Lanfeng, Luowang, Minquan, Liuhe, and Yangji. The National Army was thinly spread, and except for Yucheng, all the aforementioned locations have been reported to have fallen. There are a significant number of Communist troops in the outer areas of Kaifeng, such as Sanyizhai and Xianren Village.

[Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 16th] The Communist army in eastern Henan is actively harassing the eastern section of the Longhai Railway. Yangji (five kilometers west of Dangshan) East Station was captured on the morning of the 11th. The Communist army there is currently fleeing westward along the railway.

[Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Beiping, 16th] The Communist army has recently launched a full-scale attack on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, and the situation is quite tense. It is reported that the Xinxiang Group of the Military Mediation Team will send a sub-group to Kaifeng to investigate the truth. (News about the Lanfeng Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (ERRRA) warehouse being looted by the Communist army and staff members being shot is on page 2.)

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] The first phase of the National Army's expulsion efforts in northern Jiangsu has been completed. The Communist army is currently collapsing northeastward along a front of four hundred kilometers. The vanguard of the National Army is only fifty kilometers away from Huaiyin, only forty kilometers away from Shuyang, only twenty kilometers away from Baoying, and about seventy kilometers away from Yancheng. Xinghua City is practically in the bag. The pocket-shaped positions of the Communist army in Gaoyou and Shaobo are already surrounded on three sides by the National Army. After the National Army recaptured Jiaoxie on the 10th, the troops are now advancing rapidly towards the coast from Libao. The National Army at Dongtai and Linze has already joined forces north of Xinghua. The Communist army in Funing is moving south on a large scale and is currently in a stalemate with the National Army in the Shagou area. The vanguard of the National Army in Zhongxing has approached Shuyang, and the prelude to the future major battle will unfold between Huaiyin and Shuyang.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, [space] 16th] After suffering losses in the Battle of Libao, the Communist army on the eastern front is now powerless to act rashly. Small groups of remnants are still roaming in the area north of Libao, and local citizens are continuing to encircle and suppress them on all sides. However, part of the Communist army in Dongtai is currently moving towards Dinggou and Xiaoji. The Communist army in Gaoyou and Shaobo is also increasing and attempting to attack the Yangtai Railway line at Xiannvmiao.

I want to understand them deeply. I am also willing to exchange opinions with military and political leaders in various places and conduct a review of our work." Tang also said: "I sincerely hope that the Communist Party will abandon its erroneous 'scorched earth policy' and resolve everything through political means." He also said: "The government army around Nanjing and Shanghai is strong, and if the Communist army thinks of acting rashly, it is tantamount to throwing itself into a trap." Chairman Wang said: "The Communist Party is most capable of propaganda and creating rumors. The media should lead the people, stabilize society, and assist refugees in northern Jiangsu to return to their hometowns. As for reporters from Nanjing and Shanghai who want to go to northern Jiangsu to investigate the real situation, you are welcome to form a group and apply to Commander Li of the First Pacification Zone." Finally, Commander Li Mo'an told reporters: "The people of northern Jiangsu are living in dire straits under the Communist Party's autocracy. The so-called democracy is actually deceiving themselves. Now, everything is extremely stable, but the destruction caused by the Communist army will be difficult to recover within ten years."

It is also heard that Deputy Commander-in-Chief Tang, Chairman Wang, and Commander Li had important official duties to deal with. Tang returned to Nanjing at 6:00 PM that afternoon, and Chairman Wang and Commander Li are scheduled to [space] return to Zhenjiang and Changzhou on the 17th.

[Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency, This City] According to a spokesman for the ERRRA, the ERRRA Henan Branch sent an urgent telegram on the 15th stating that when the Communist army occupied Lanfeng on the 10th of this month, the Director of the Warehouse Office of the ERRRA in the district, Zhang Yingjun, immediately sealed up the supplies in the ERRRA warehouse.

### Heavy Rains Cause Disaster in Western Yunnan; Over 200,000 Mu of Rice Fields Submerged

[Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Director of the ERRRA Yunnan West Office, Xu Songjiu, recently came to Shanghai Shuzhan and hosted reporters to report on the work situation. At the same time, he displayed musical instruments such as the Hulusi of the Lolo and other ethnic groups in western Yunnan, as well as local aboriginal embroideries, classics, and gang paintings. They are particularly valuable to those who are concerned about the border culture of our country. Director Jiang also came to visit. Director Xu said: "There are eleven counties in Yunnan, and the area is more than 40,000 square kilometers, which is even larger than Taiwan. The altitude [space] ranges from 600 meters to 4,500 meters, and some are above the [space] line, which can be called the 'Sea of Mountains'. Therefore, transportation is also extremely inconvenient. There are no rivers for ships to travel, and there are no railways for transportation. If someone wants to inspect this area for a week, it will take as many as 191 days."

The ethnic groups in this area are also extremely complex. Including the Han ethnic group, there are a total of twenty-one ethnic groups. Epidemics are prevalent, and the office is currently sending people to various places with one ton of DDT to stop them. Then, animal epidemics suddenly became popular.

### New Style in "Liberated Areas": Men and Women Paired by Number for Marriage; After Seven Days, Original Numbers Returned for Re-Pairing

[Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Xi'an, 16th] According to refugees who escaped from the Communist-occupied areas, the Communist army recently invented a "zhuangpai matchmaking method" in the so-called "liberated areas." The method is to gather an equal number of men and women from a village or town in one place, and then use two copies of the zhuangpai engraved with numbers, randomly distributed to each man and woman, and then start matching numbers, man one to woman one, man two to woman two, and so on. According to the compatriots who were humiliated under the "number matchmaking", I do not know everyone [space], uncle and niece, stepmother and stepson, father, brother, and sister, Buddhist believers and young nuns, once matched by number, should be "married" for seven days. After seven days, the original cards are returned, and re-numbered, and then "matched" again. Ethical rules are destroyed to the extreme.

### Dutch East Indies Groundlessly Detains Our Merchants' Goods; Overseas Chinese Suffer Heavy Losses; Singapore Importers and Exporters Association Requests Negotiations

[Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Singapore, 15th] Kuo Shanhu, Chairman of the Singapore Chinese Importers and Exporters Association, said at a press conference this afternoon that trade between Singapore and the Dutch East Indies is currently encountering the greatest crisis, because the Dutch navy in the ports of the Dutch East Indies is unreasonably detaining and confiscating our merchant ships. The first incident occurred on July 3, at a port in Sumatra, and a Chinese steamship carrying 23 tons of cotton cloth was confiscated there. The capital of the members of the Importers and Exporters Association who are engaged in trade between Singapore and the Dutch East Indies reaches a total of 30 million yuan, of which 15 percent has suffered unknown losses for the above reasons. There are still eighteen of our merchant ships detained by the Dutch navy. Their excuse is that the goods on board were stolen goods bought from the Japanese. However, this excuse is groundless. The confiscated goods totaled 900 tons, mostly rubber, food, and lump sugar. On August 13, the Importers and Exporters Association advised its members to temporarily suspend trade with the Dutch East Indies pending negotiations with the Dutch East Indies authorities to resolve the matter. The consuls general of our country in Singapore and Batavia should pay attention to this matter and promise to negotiate with the Dutch East Indies authorities.

### American Newspapers Discuss Chairman Chiang's Message

[Dispatch from the United States Information Service, Washington, 15th] New York newspapers have commented extensively on Chairman Chiang's Victory Day message. The Herald Tribune said: "If what Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said in his message can be implemented without any discounts, then most Americans are willing to give him the strongest support." The article cited many examples, pointing out that "there is a big difference between what Chairman Chiang says and what his subordinates do." The report continued: "It seems that when the Chairman was drafting his message, he accepted the opinions of the best elements of the Kuomintang. These elements are upright, capable, and love China, but when he wants to put the principles into practice, he accepts the opinions of the worst elements. These elements are corrupt and reactionary. All the bad things in China cannot be attributed to one side alone, and likewise, all the good things cannot be attributed to one side alone." The Communist Party has done many things (especially in the past few weeks) to confirm the sharp and pessimistic tone in Chairman Chiang's message; but we doubt very much whether Chairman Chiang's strong words to the Communist Party are the best way to promote peace and unity. Similarly, it is also very doubtful whether the Communist Party's recent fierce remarks will cure China's problems. There is currently nothing but provocation and dispute in China, but in order to strive for peace, there should be calmer discussions. The most gratifying part of Chairman Chiang's message is that he reaffirmed the right to exist of his political enemies, when he first allowed to expand the basis of the government, "to accommodate the various parties and non-party members", and allow to cooperate with those who severely criticize his regime. If this promise can be fulfilled, then those brave enemies of the reactionary and corrupt elements, such as the two assassinated professors (referring to Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo), can join the government.

The Times declared: "Chairman Chiang's message is enough to clarify the situation and formulate a plan that all good Chinese people can agree to. In this way, General Marshall's mediation work can also be promoted." The Times concluded: "The American people will approve of Chairman Chiang's message and pay attention to its implementation with a sympathetic attitude. Americans are only interested in China's independence, peace, and prosperity, and they only hope that the Communist Party will see this and work together with the majority."

Editorial

### The Question of the Dardanelles Strait

As the Paris Peace Conference enters its third week and the world commemorates the first anniversary of the complete end of World War II, the Soviet Union has suddenly made a demand on Turkey, advocating for the revision of the Montreux Convention, with the Dardanelles Strait to be jointly managed by Black Sea nations, and the defense of the Strait to be jointly the responsibility of the Soviet Union and Turkey. The presentation of this demand, coinciding with the unrest in Iran and the eventful situation in the Near East, has further agitated the already complex and delicate international relations. While it may not be a political bombshell, it is undoubtedly of great significance to the future evolution of international relations and the progress of the Paris Peace Conference. It is reported that the Soviet Union's notification to Turkey was made on August 8th. Not only does it greatly infringe upon the sovereignty and independence of Turkey, but it also has a serious impact on the other signatories of the Montreux Convention. Therefore, public opinion in Britain and the United States has expressed opposition to this move by the Soviet Union. Turkey's reply to the Soviet Union has already been delivered to Moscow, firmly rejecting the Soviet demands. The future development of the Dardanelles Strait issue is indeed worthy of our close attention.

We have not had the opportunity to read the full text of the original Soviet note to Turkey, so it is not appropriate to speculate. However, according to reports from various news agencies, there are several points worthy of our attention: (1) Should the responsibility for the defense of the Strait be jointly borne by the Soviet Union and Turkey? (2) It expresses the hope that only the Black Sea coastal countries should discuss the new status of the Strait, and these so-called Black Sea coastal countries include only the Soviet Union, Romania, Bulgaria, and Turkey. If the reports are true, then what the Soviet Union is actually demanding is not a revision of the Montreux Convention, but the abandonment of the former convention. Therefore, it hopes that only the Black Sea coastal countries will discuss the new status of the Strait, and these Black Sea coastal countries are almost all vassals of the Soviet Union. This clearly indicates its desire to exclude other signatories of the Montreux Convention outside of the Black Sea coastal countries, turning an international issue into a bilateral issue between the Soviet Union and Turkey. The Soviet Union was originally one of the signatories of the Montreux Convention, and in the Potsdam Conference, in order to accommodate Soviet demands, there was also an agreement to revise the former convention. If the Soviet Union requests a reconsideration of the Strait issue, it should issue notes to the countries participating in the Potsdam Conference and to other signatories of the Montreux Convention that did not lose their international status due to this war. The Soviet Union's failure to do so, directly making demands on Turkey alone, is quite thought-provoking in its significance.

The Dardanelles Strait was originally one of the world's important waterways, the only passage to the sea for the Black Sea countries. Therefore, after World War I, the Treaty of Lausanne, signed with Turkey in 1923, stipulated that Turkey should not establish fortresses or deploy troops in certain areas near the Strait. Later, due to the evolution of the situation, this was clearly an unequal treaty for Turkey. At Turkey's request, it was abolished and replaced by the convention signed in Montreux, Switzerland, in July 1936, establishing a new system for the Dardanelles Strait, lifting restrictions on the exercise of Turkish sovereignty in the Strait area, and transferring the powers of the Strait Commission to the Turkish government. According to this convention, Turkey may not blockade this important waterway. Even if Turkey is a member of a belligerent nation, passage through the Strait must be open during the day. However, in order to defend the free passage of the Strait, Turkey may establish fortresses and deploy troops in the Strait area. This Montreux Convention is valid for 30 years, and the signatories include Britain, France, Japan, the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Romania, Greece, Bulgaria, Turkey, and other countries. Since there is such an international treaty as the foundation for the Dardanelles Strait, any changes to the Strait system must naturally be the result of international consultation and are by no means only a matter between the Soviet Union and Turkey, which is self-evident.

If the Dardanelles Strait issue were a single issue unrelated to other issues, the international attention it might arouse, though not insignificant, would not be as significant as it is now. From a broader perspective, the presentation of this Strait issue is closely related to the failure of the Paris Peace Conference to achieve harmony, the sudden worsening of the situation in Iran, the increasingly high walls of the Eastern European bloc, and various developments in other parts of the world, including our China. This is truly a link in the interlocking chain of many international issues today; and based on existing signs, this interlocking chain is showing an increasing trend of expansion and development. For each problem, that is, any link in the interlocking chain, there is only one way to deal with it separately; of course, dealing with it separately does not help solve any single problem. In this sense, we believe that even though Turkey's reply has been delivered to the Soviet Union, it does not seem possible to consider the matter to be over. On the contrary, the end of this event may be the beginning of another event. Unless the prejudices between the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States are eliminated, problems will continue to emerge endlessly. Therefore, the world will naturally pay special attention to how the Dardanelles Strait issue unfolds.

From a geographical point of view, we understand and sympathize to a considerable extent with the Soviet Union's major interest in the Dardanelles Strait. This is the main sea route for the Soviet Union's south; the obstruction of this route will seriously affect the Soviet Union. It is natural and reasonable for Soviet advisors to go to the Strait. Because of this, the Soviet Union is also one of the signatories of the Montreux Convention. However, if, merely for the sake of the Soviet Union's "security," the "security" and sovereignty of other countries are infringed upon, or unreasonable demands are made by unreasonable means, it may not be conducive to the solution of the problem. At the same time, if a compromise or appeasement attitude is adopted towards the presentation of demands, it may not be possible to solve the problem, or it may turn the problem into an even more serious one. Therefore, the Dardanelles Strait issue is not a simple issue; and its reasonable solution especially requires enlightened handling and broad demeanor from politicians.

Pay Attention to Prevention and Supervise Surveying

Since the beginning of summer, this port has experienced frequent rains. Moreover, the dikes on both sides of the Huai River have collapsed and caused disasters in many places, turning the area into a watery land. In view of this, the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission, in order to prevent disasters, also requested the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission to report daily for reference. On the one hand, the commission requested funds for resumption of work and supervised the Jiangdi First Repair and Prevention Office to conduct a survey. In addition, it assigned engineer Zhang Kexun, who also served as the captain of the Jiangdi Survey Team, to handle the implementation of the Huayang River area plan. It is reported that the commission announced that in the first phase of this year, 175 ponds and dikes, 9 sluice gates, and 30 stone dams were built, and 38 sections of embankments were repaired, completing a total of 5,378,848 cubic meters of earthwork, irrigating more than 100,000 mu of farmland. It is hoped that the commission will complete the construction of the Guangji Changwei huge project in sunny weather after the busy farming season, so as to prevent flooding and benefit the rural areas.

### Under the Watchful Eyes of the Far East Tribunal: Puppet Emperor Puyi Testifies, Exposing Japan's Past Atrocities in Northeast China

[Special Dispatch from Tokyo by This Newspaper Correspondent on the 16th] Puyi testified here today, claiming that he accepted the puppet Manchukuo "throne" because of excessive Japanese threats, and had no choice but to "reluctantly" accept it. Puyi admitted that he was a puppet with no rights. This puppet emperor then attempted to justify his crimes, claiming that since no countries intended to confront the Japanese at the time, and he was powerless to act alone, he had no choice but to endure humiliation and seek survival. He continued to state that ten months after the Pearl Harbor incident, Japan originally planned to attack the Soviet Union from "Manchuria" in October 1942.

[Special Dispatch from Tokyo by This Newspaper Correspondent on the 16th] The puppet emperor of Manchukuo, Puyi, appeared for the first time today at the Far East International Tribunal. Puyi was thin and wore tortoiseshell-rimmed glasses, and his attitude seemed very natural. He testified for 35 minutes, and all his statements related to his family situation. When Chief Prosecutor Keenan questioned him, Puyi gestured frequently and occasionally tapped his feet. Every time he spoke, he leaned forward to be closer to the microphone. He often received instructions from the interpreter, indicating that his English proficiency was quite good. After the interrogation, Puyi smiled and accepted photographers in the witness box. The weather was cool today, but Puyi kept fanning himself, presumably because he was sweating profusely. This was Puyi's first appearance before the general public in several years.

### Ten Years of Imperial Dreams in Vain: Appointed Head of Puppet Manchukuo Out of Fear of Death

[Renovation Society Tokyo 16th Telegram] The puppet emperor of Manchukuo, Puyi, appeared at the Far East International Tribunal today. At 8:45 a.m., a large car from the Soviet Embassy arrived at the main gate of the court, and after getting out of the car, he entered Room 123 on the side of the main gate. Chief Prosecutor Keenan immediately came to talk to him. Puyi was wearing a neat dark blue suit and smiled throughout the conversation, appearing quite comfortable. After talking in this room for about ten minutes, he was summoned to the Chief Prosecutor's office on the second floor. At 11:27 a.m., after American lawyer Maruyama Chenshu described the Japanese army's killing, arson, rape, and plunder in Nanjing, Puyi stepped onto the witness stand. Cameramen quickly turned to the "emperor" in an attempt to capture this historic scene. American military police stood guard on both sides of the "emperor," indicating a different level of caution than that afforded to ordinary witnesses. Former commander of the Kwantung Army, Meizu, who had the deepest relationship with Puyi, did not forget his old friendship at this time, solemnly welcoming the "emperor" into the room. Former Chief Secretary of Manchukuo, Hoshino, also put down his pencil and greeted him with a respectful look. Tojo, Ban, Doihara, and other "meritorious officials" of Manchukuo also appeared tense. The audience and VIP seats were full, all eager to see the "emperor's" demeanor and listen to the story of his ten-year imperial dream.

### A History of Puppetry

After Puyi was sworn in, he answered Keenan's direct questions. He first stated his brief history, saying: I was born in Beijing in 1906, ascended the throne in 1909, and in 1911, Premier Sun led the revolution. Mr. Sun was a great figure in China, and after the success of the revolution, I abdicated the throne in 1911, at the age of five. The Republican government allowed me to retain my Qing Dynasty imperial family status and provided me with 4 million yuan, so I continued to reside in Beijing. At that time, everything in the palace was managed by the Imperial Household Department, the interior of which was notoriously corrupt. In 1924, civil war broke out in China, and Feng Yuxiang fought against Zhang Zuolin of Manchuria. Feng Yuxiang arrested President Cao锟斤拷 and ordered me to leave the palace immediately. I went to my father Zai锟斤拷's house in the city. At that time, my English teacher Johnson and the British Minister MacLeay discussed a place to go. The result was that the British Minister's residence was too small, so it was better to go to the Japanese Embassy. I fled to the Japanese Embassy and lived there for half a year, then moved to Tianjin. On September 18, 1931, the Japanese army forcibly occupied the three northeastern provinces. At that time, I was living in Tianjin, and strange things happened around me. One day, someone with a Chinese name sent a fruit basket containing a bomb. At that time, the commander of the Tianjin garrison, Xiang锟斤拷, advised me that Tianjin was dangerous and it was better to go to Lushun. I had no choice but to go to Lushun in 1931, leaving my father and wife in Tianjin.

### Surrendering to Force

At that time, Commander of the Kwantung Army Honjo sent Staff Officer Colonel Ban锟斤拷 Zheng Shiro to tell me that the Zhang Xueliang regime in the three northeastern provinces was imposing harsh taxes and oppressing the people, and the vested interests of Japan were also being infringed upon. Therefore, they planned to expel the warlords, eliminate the communists, and establish a new country, saying that this was Commander Honjo's order, and also said, "You are a Manchurian, so we hope that you will be the head of Manchuria." I refused immediately. Ban锟斤拷 and I talked for two hours. At that time, after the Japanese army occupied Shenyang, they also occupied the entire three northeastern provinces, and established a local security maintenance association in Shenyang. Doihara was a major figure in it, forcing the Chinese officials who remained in Shenyang to take up positions. The reason why I refused Ban锟斤拷's request was because they oppressed Chinese officials and ordered Japanese to be officials of "Manchukuo." Ban锟斤拷 was very unhappy with my refusal, and returned to his residence to tell my advisor, "Please ask Puyi to be the head of the new government, this is the Kwantung Army's decision. If he refuses, we will take decisive action." At that time, Ban锟斤拷's attitude was very stern and threatening. My advisor was very worried, saying that if I refused, my life would be in danger, and advised me not to refuse. I then thought that Japan's oppression was a threat to the world, and we had no force, so how could we resist? Although I wanted to refuse, I was afraid for my life and finally succumbed to the Japanese army's oppression.

The Original Chinese Translator Did Not Want to Translate for Him

[Associated Press Tokyo 16th Telegram] The International Tribunal convened this morning at 9:30, and the puppet Puyi has been taken to the court secretariat to await his summons. The Soviets refused to allow American reporters to speak with him. The puppet Puyi entered the court at 11:25 a.m., looking much like a flustered businessman. The defense lawyer, Le Wen, asked the court whether the witness was reading from notes. Chief Justice Webb replied: I saw him flipping through the papers in his hand, and immediately, at Le Wen's request, issued an order to the witness, as usual, not to consult notes without the court's permission. The questions and answers were all in Chinese, then translated into English and Japanese. Today, Puyi appeared in court, the first royal figure, and as a result, the audience seats were full. UN reporters scrambled to attend, including nine Soviet reporters. When answering questions from Prosecutor Ji Bu, he first looked at the defendants. The defendants also seemed quite interested. Former Prime Minister Tojo leaned forward and recorded the testimony. Most of the defendants wore headphones to listen to his testimony. Puyi's testimony was quite crisp, but his face was serious and expressionless. Authoritative sources said: The original Chinese translator did not want to translate for a traitor, so another translator was appointed. Puyi lived in Tianjin from the age of twelve to twenty-seven, and then went to the northeast, where he reappeared as emperor.

Will Present Strong Evidence, Including Four Key Points

[Central News Agency Tokyo 15th Special Telegram] Authoritative sources said: The former puppet emperor Puyi, who will testify at the International Tribunal tomorrow, will present the strongest evidence to oppose Japan's policy in China, especially its policy in the Northeast. Puyi will present evidence on four key points: (1) Japan's rule in the Northeast, (2) Japan's exploitation of China's wealthiest regions, (3) Japan's view of Puyi as a puppet emperor, (4) The treatment of the Chinese people in the Northeast. It is heard that Puyi extremely hated the treatment that Japan gave to himself (Manchukuo) officials and the Chinese people in the Northeast during its thirteen years of rule in the Northeast. During his preliminary questioning at the examination station, Puyi expressed extreme hatred for the lack of freedom during his tenure as "emperor" and the enslavement of the Chinese people in the Northeast.

### British-Egyptian Treaty Negotiations Undergo Serious Change

Britain Proposes Memorandum Containing Three Points

[Reuters Cairo 15th Telegram] Negotiations on the revision of the British-Egyptian treaty have suddenly undergone a serious change. The Egyptian cabinet convened a special meeting this morning to discuss the situation. Since the Egyptian ambassador to Britain suddenly returned home a few days ago, bringing with him a memorandum from British Foreign Secretary Bevin, the situation has entered an unprecedentedly delicate stage. Reliable sources said that the memorandum put forward three points: (1) Britain refuses Egypt's claim to sovereignty over Sudan, that is, the so-called demand for the unification of the Nile River basin; (2) Britain can only reduce the deadline for the withdrawal of British troops from Egypt from five years to three years at most; (3) Britain insists that in the event of aggression against Egypt or its Middle Eastern neighbors, Britain and Egypt should immediately consult on joint action and take necessary steps. Egypt has always firmly opposed the aforementioned third point.

### Paris Peace Conference: Commencement of Actual Work; Each Subcommittee Elects a Chairman; Bernays' Two Assistants Summoned to Paris

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Paris, 16th Broadcast: The Paris Peace Conference today transitioned to discussions by the committees on the five-nation treaties.

### The Simple yet Enigmatic Political Situation in India - Compiled by Our Editorial Department

Dark Clouds Looming - Ancient Eastern Nation

The political situation in India, just like this ancient and complex country, has always been a mystery to Chinese readers. India's independence movement can be said to have a history of ninety years. Over the past ninety years, how much has been said, and how much blood has been shed, but the issue has never been resolved. Every time a ray of hope appears, the dim shadow reappears. We cannot help but ask: What exactly is going on? What problems are lurking behind the scenes? Where is the center of the dispute, and what are its hidden meanings? This article aims to provide a longitudinal analysis of this elusive Indian question.

To understand the complexity of the Indian issue, we must first understand that India is indeed a complex country in all aspects. It is a land spanning two million square miles, and if Russia is not included, then the entirety of Europe added together would not be as large. On this vast land, lives four hundred million unfortunate people, a number that almost accounts for one-fifth of the world's entire human population. Among these four hundred million people, there are forty-five different ethnic groups, and their languages number as many as two hundred and eighty-five. These differences in ethnicity and language greatly hinder mutual understanding and unity among the Indian people. But the biggest obstacle is not race or language, but religion. In India, the majority of people belong to Hinduism, accounting for about three hundred million of the total population, while the remaining approximately ninety million people are Muslims. Hindus make up a large majority of government civil servants and intellectuals, while Muslims, being brave and fierce, have a large presence in the military. (An interesting fact is that the British have always encouraged Hindus to study and Muslims to join the army.) Hindus and Muslims have never been on good terms, which is reflected politically in the conflict between the National Congress Party and the Muslim League. Not only that, India still retains many small courts ruling their separate regions, numbering as many as five hundred and sixty-two. Some of these small courts are civilized, while others are barbaric, chaotic, and each governs its own affairs. In the struggle for Indian independence, these small courts are also a troublesome issue.

Let us not forget that the British, who ruled India, not only allowed this complex situation to exist, but also used its complexity and contradictions as a tool to rule and deal with the independence movement. The history of India's independence struggle over the decades is a story of internal disputes, plus the British exploiting the situation. At this point, we need to briefly review the historical course of the Indian independence movement and the organizations and figures leading the independence movement. Naturally, the most important is the Indian National Congress. It is mainly composed of Hindus, but also includes a small portion of Muslims, most of whom split from the Congress in 1906 and formed a separate Muslim League. The National Congress Party and the Muslim League are currently the two largest political parties in India, and although their goals are the same: "to get the British to withdraw from India and let them become independent,"

they are completely opposed on how independence should be achieved. The Congress Party advocates a free and unified India, but the Muslim League insists on partition. Muslims feel that Hindus, who make up three-quarters of the population, are clearly the de facto rulers of India, and Muslims, whose lives, thoughts, and religions are different from those of Hindus, will find it extremely difficult to survive under a Hindu-majority government. They demand separation, they argue that the provinces in northwestern and northeastern India where Muslims are concentrated must completely separate from the rest of the Indian peninsula and form a separate independent region, which Jinnah calls "Pakistan." The British are very happy about this dispute. British governors-general throughout history have all helped and supported the smaller Muslim League, either openly or secretly, and placed it on an equal footing, so that Indians were still unable to achieve true independence and had already started arguing among themselves. So the British put on a sad and troubled face, standing by and saying, "How can we discuss it further when you haven't figured it out yourselves?" The discord between India and the Muslims greatly weakened the strength of the Indian independence movement and delayed the success of the independence movement. In 1942, Sir Stafford Cripps came to India, and the famous Cripps proposals failed in part because of the issue of "Pakistan". Last year, in 1945, the Wavell Plan, proposed by Indian Viceroy Lord Wavell, was much more advanced and practical than the Cripps proposals, but it still failed, again due to the unfortunate dispute over "Pakistan." Although internal disputes have never subsided, the tide of the independence movement, after this great war, has been further stimulated by world trends and is surging like a storm.

### Second Batch of Our Occupation Army Stationed in Japan Arrives in Shanghai on Two Ships; Commanded by Division Commander Dai, Stationed in Two Locations in the Center of Wusong City

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] The 67th Division of our country's occupation army stationed in Japan (formerly reorganized from the Honorary Second Division), except for the First Regiment which arrived in Shanghai on the 5th of this month and is temporarily stationed in the Wusong barracks, the Second Regiment and the units directly under the division, led by Division Commander Dai Jian and Deputy Division Commander Liu Shenghe on the 10th, departed from Haiphong on the "Hai Zhang" and "Hai Di" ships, and transited through Hong Kong to Shanghai. The "Hai Zhang" ship entered the port at 7:30 AM yesterday, docked at the Wusong Naval Pier, carrying more than 2,500 soldiers of the Second Regiment. After arriving at the port, Deputy Division Commander Liu, Regiment Commander Liu Yuanbo, and the battalion commanders separately directed the disembarkation. However, there were many vehicles and supplies on board, and unloading was not completed until last night. The "Hai Di" ship, on which Division Commander Dai was traveling, arrived at the Songkou port at 5:40 PM yesterday, but could not enter the port due to the lack of a pier for docking. The ship carried units directly under the division, including the Transport Battalion, Engineer Battalion, Special Service Company, and Communications Company. The Division Commander had to go to the capital to request instructions, so he boarded a small boat with several attendants at around 6 o'clock and landed first. All officers and soldiers of the Second Regiment have been stationed in the Wusong barracks yesterday. The division headquarters will be located at the original site of the municipal government in the city center. The Third Regiment, which is still staying in Haiphong, will come to Shanghai on the "Hai Su" ship within the next few days. Once the entire division arrives, they can head east. Moreover, all the officers and soldiers of the division had been wounded two to seven times during the eight years of the War of Resistance, so the soldiers are covered in scars. This time, being ordered to occupy Japan is truly an honor for these veterans. Deputy Division Commander Liu Shenghe once wrote a "Five Hundred Character Chart" to teach soldiers to read, so most of the soldiers in the division can read more than five hundred characters. Since being ordered to be stationed in Japan, they have started learning basic Japanese, and have never slacked off.

Also, the resumes of Deputy Division Commander Liu Shenghe and Regiment Commander Liu Yuanbo are as follows: Major General Deputy Division Commander, Liu Shenghe, courtesy name Shoushen, is from Hubei province, 39 years old this year, graduated from the 7th class of the military academy in 1930, and has served as a platoon leader, company commander, battalion commander, and deputy regiment commander of the 33rd Regiment of the 11th Division of the former 18th Army. He participated in the suppression of bandits in Jiangxi and Zhejiang, and the War of Resistance in Shanghai, Hubei, and western Hubei, suffering serious injuries twice and minor injuries three times. He was transferred to his current position in the spring of 1943.

Colonel Liu Yuanbo, courtesy name Baidui, from Hubei province, graduated from the 7th class of the military academy and the Kunming Combat Personnel Training Class, and has served as a platoon leader, company commander, battalion commander, deputy regiment commander of the former Chinese Literature Camp, Guard Brigade, and the 88th and 36th Divisions of the former Army, and as a colonel staff officer of the 11th Army Group Headquarters. He participated in the suppression of bandits in Zhejiang and Jiangxi, and the War of Resistance in Shanghai, Henan, Hubei, Yunnan, and western Yunnan, suffering serious injuries five times. In the spring of 1943, he was transferred to this division as chief of staff, and then transferred from chief of staff to his current position.

### To Solve the City's Housing Shortage: Municipal Council Approves Two Measures: Awarding and Assisting Housing Construction and Selling New Villages

The municipal government has decided to solve the housing shortage through both temporary and permanent measures, proceeding on both fronts. The temporary solution is to build 154 new village houses for citizens and sell them to citizens at a price of 3 million yuan per house. The permanent solution is to award and assist people in constructing houses and guide idle capital to assist in construction. Both of the above measures were approved for implementation at the municipal council meeting yesterday morning. The details of the measures are recorded as follows:

### Reducing and Exempting Various Taxes for Newly Built Residential Buildings

(1) Reduce and exempt various taxes and levies on newly built residential buildings to remove obstacles to people investing in construction. (2) The land tax will be waived for two years for the land on which new residential buildings are built, and if it is transferred within one year, its land value increment tax will be waived, and the deed tax will be reduced by half. (2) The rent for newly built houses will not be subject to the city's current rent standards. (3) For newly built residential buildings, the property tax payable by the owner will be exempted for one year. (2) Award and assist social capital in constructing houses. (1) Negotiate with national financial institutions to invest in housing construction. Provide mortgage loans as much as possible to those who build new houses, and the real estate mortgage property rights can be certified by the Land Administration Bureau. (2) Anyone who builds a new house may apply to the government for leasing public barren land, and the lease term and rent will be in accordance with the provisions of the Land Law. (3) Designate appropriate public land in the suburbs for the construction of shacks. The shacks in the current restricted construction zone should gradually be concentrated within the designated area. (4) The government should provide as much convenience as possible for the roads, water, electricity and other facilities in the newly built housing areas. (3) Urge the construction of houses on privately owned vacant land. Privately owned wasteland will be limited to one year for construction. If it is not built within the time limit, the vacant land tax (three to ten times) should be added when collecting the land tax in accordance with the provisions of the Land Law. (4) Reward the repair of houses. For houses that have been dilapidated and uninhabited, if it is verified to be true, they may enjoy the various preferential measures stipulated in this method after repairs.

### One Hundred and Fifty-Four New Houses, 3 Million Yuan Each

1. The Damu Bridge Citizen New Village in the South City, a total of 154 houses, adopts the method of selling each house separately. Each household is limited to one house. The price of each house is 3.2 million yuan if paid in installments. The payment method is divided into A. Pay 1 million yuan when the purchase is approved, B. Pay 1 million yuan when notified to move in, C. Pay 1.2 million yuan in twelve equal monthly installments starting from the month after moving in. If the purchaser pays the full amount at one time when the purchase is approved, the price can be reduced to 3 million yuan. 1. The land on which the new village is built is not included in the scope of the sale and is still public property of the city. The Municipal Land Administration Bureau will annually estimate the market value of the land. The purchaser will pay 8% of the estimated value as land rent annually and pay it to the Xingye Trust Company in January each year. 1. The public facilities of the new village are jointly owned by all residents and may be transferred together with the house, but may not be disposed of separately. 1. Citizens of this city who wish to purchase a house can register with the Xingye Trust Company from the date of the public announcement. After passing the examination, a permit will be issued, and the first installment of the property price will be paid with the permit. The registration method and examination standards will be determined separately. 1. After the purchaser pays the first installment of the property price, the ownership of the house will belong to the purchaser, and they should immediately find a reliable guarantor and enter into a ground lease contract with the Xingye Trust Company. The contract should specify the following items: (A) The lease term is set for ten years. After the expiry of the term, a new contract may be signed to extend the lease term. (B) If any installment of the property price is overdue, the guarantor shall be responsible for immediate compensation. (1) The purchaser shall use the house for self-occupation within one year. If they want to transfer it to others, they must obtain the consent of the Xingye Trust Company and indicate it in the contract. (1) The proceeds from the sale of the house should be stored in a special account at the Xingye Trust Company for the use of the municipal government to build similar houses, and should not be diverted. (1) The sale, rent collection and management of the house are entrusted to the Xingye Trust Company.

Yang Wendao Case to be Retried Today

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] The Yang Wendao case, after many twists and turns, is scheduled to be retried at 2:00 PM today in the Second Criminal Court of the Higher Court on North Zhejiang Road. Qian Hongye, the criminal court president who has been in charge of this case for many years, was brutally murdered by traitors during the "76th" reign of terror. Because the environment was bad when the case happened, President Qian took extreme pains in handling this case. Although there were many criticisms from the outside world, President Qian has already given the most powerful reply with his blood. Even Yang Wendao himself, who was sentenced to death by him, also expressed his utmost respect for Mr. Qian. Now that victory has come, this case can also be revealed. But it is unknown what the lawyers Bo Liang and Ru Baoyi of the police station, who attacked Yang Wenfan most fiercely in the past, think.

### Sun Tianchang's Case: New Evidence Continues to Emerge; Former Foreman Testifies; Investigation Team Believes Crimes Established

[Report from this newspaper] In the case of Sun Tianchang's alleged provision of resources to the enemy, the investigation team yesterday obtained important testimonial and material evidence. A decisive new development is expected in the near future. According to Committee Member Zhang Qingzhen, who is handling the case, the investigation team is carefully considering how to deal with the case, implying that decisive action will be taken.

The reason is that yesterday, a citizen, Hu Chenggen, submitted a document to the investigation team, willing to testify in this case. The content of his submission roughly stated: one year after the war, Hu worked at the Dongyang Firm in the Hardoon Building, whose owner was Sun Changzhi. At that time, the company only produced small lathes and drilling machines on a small scale. A month later, the business expanded, and Hu was promoted to foreman. A year later, Sun Changzhi and Hu went to Nanjing together to take over the Jinling Arsenal for the enemy, undertaking the repair of various machines at the factory. Sun also bought military materials such as hardware and various coins for the enemy. Sun started his fortune from this, becoming rich for a time. Later, in order to curry favor with the enemy, he even offered fighter planes to the enemy army, named "Sun Tian." In September of the 31st year of the Republic [1942], the factory moved to 927 Route Pétain, occupying the Moutrie piano factory. Under the name of military management, all kinds of munitions were manufactured. The factory was divided into nine departments, employing more than 160 Chinese, foreign, and Japanese workers. It produced milling machines, copper pumps, flame throwers, bayonet presses, rifle cartridges, and repaired tanks. In addition, the original informants, Zhou Ganfu, Han Kaiyuan, and Zhou Qingrong, also submitted two important pieces of evidence to the investigation team at 5 PM yesterday: (1) Sun Tianchang offered two aircraft to the enemy government, which was published on the second page of the first section of the *Shen Bao* newspaper controlled by the puppet government on September 20, 1943. The naval aircraft section stated, "Shipboard bombing machine 'Report the Nation No. 1467' (First Shanghai Precision Machinery No.) 'Report the Nation No. 1468' (Second Shanghai Precision Machinery No.) Contributor: Sun Tianchang." (2) The car military permit used by Sun Tianchang during the fall of this city was an oval-shaped military-Shanghai No. 20 (Note: this kind of circular permit could not be used unless one had a close relationship with the enemy military department.) Committee Member Zhang Qingzhen of the investigation team greatly praised the original plaintiffs for their spirit of assisting in collecting evidence, believing that Sun's crimes were sufficient to be established based on these two pieces of evidence, and indicated that the case would be handled impartially as soon as possible.

### Case of Murdering American Aircrew Member; Witness Details What He Saw

[Report from this newspaper] The American military court reopened the trial of Major John Holcomb, a pilot of the former 14th Air Force, who was killed after crashing in Hong Kong, starting at 8 AM yesterday morning. The six defendants, Tanaka Hisaichi, Fukuchi Harumi, Kubo Nichigai, Watanabe Masamori, Yamaguchi Norikazu, and Asakawa Hiroko, sat quietly in the defendant's seat, listening to the testimony of witness Nakazawa Tomoo. Nakazawa previously worked as an interpreter for the Japanese Hong Kong occupation army headquarters and witnessed Major Holcomb's trial and execution by the Japanese military court. Yesterday, the chief prosecutor and the defendant's defense lawyer raised various questions, which Nakazawa testified to in detail. It is said that the Japanese army headquarters was reported that a civilian ship was sunk by Holcomb, killing eight Chinese fishermen, so he was sentenced to death. However, the key points were: (1) Holcomb denied sinking the civilian ship at that time. His target was a destroyer, and it was not intentional if civilians were injured while performing this task. Holcomb also mentioned the fact that the Japanese army injured civilians when they attacked Pearl Harbor and bombed mainland China as an example. (2) At the time of the trial, the necessary testimonial and material evidence required by law was not provided. Only based on a report from the Japanese army headquarters, Holcomb was convicted immediately after his defense. Nakazawa finished his testimony close to 12 noon. Another witness, Kawashima, the former sergeant of the Japanese occupation army in Hong Kong, testified, and the court adjourned to be retried at one PM, still unfinished.

### Committee Members of the Investigation Team Inspect Various Warehouses

[Report from this newspaper] In order to understand the current status of all warehouses that were seized and sealed by the Suzhou-Zhejiang-Anhui Enemy and Puppet Property Reception and Investigation Team, the investigation team decided that Committee Members Zhang Qingzhen and Wu Wangji will personally depart from today to inspect various warehouses.

### Distribution of Goods for Public Educators; Registration and Certificate Collection to Begin Soon; Nine American Food Items Only Sell for 400 Yuan

In order to distribute goods to public educators in this city and reduce the burden on them, the municipal government has specially established the Shanghai Public Educator Goods Distribution Office, which has already started operations. To understand the distribution methods and procedures, a reporter visited the office director, Gu Tiyang, who stated: The office's distribution of goods will begin soon. The following personnel can receive allocations: (1) Public educators directly under the municipal government; (2) Public educators not affiliated with the municipal government (including those affiliated with central, provincial, and municipal government agencies and state-owned enterprises stationed in Shanghai); (3) Teachers and staff of charities, free professional groups, and public and private schools in this city, and internal and external staff of various newspapers and news agencies. As for the distribution procedures, the heads of each agency or organization should first prepare an official letter stating the actual number of current employees and designate a responsible person to contact the office to obtain the distribution certificate and registration form. After filling it out themselves, they should send it to the office together. After the office reviews it in the fastest possible steps, it will issue an official distribution certificate. Each person gets one certificate, and each certificate has 20 small squares of allocation stamps, which can be used for 20 distributions. Registration and application for distribution certificates are scheduled to begin on the 20th of this month and end on the 25th. It is hoped that each agency or organization will follow the deadline to complete the procedures at No. 180 Fuzhou Road so that the distribution can begin as soon as possible. The types and prices of the distributed goods will be notified separately five days before each distribution. Gu continued: There are about 200,000 public educators in this city. The office will try its best to make this certificate distribution system perfect and find ways to enrich the source of distribution items in order to provide them universally.

[Another dispatch] The first distribution item from the office is an American-made travel lunchbox containing nine food items: small cans of meat, biscuits, jujube paste, milk powder, coffee, milk, and mixed cakes, with a rich capacity and a very low allocation price of only 400 yuan in national currency per box.

### Handover of City Council is Ready; Xiang Changquan Appointed Secretary-General

The handover procedures between the City Council, established after the "August 13th" Incident, and the former Provisional City Council were held at 4 PM yesterday at the original site of the former Provisional City Council at No. 48 Fuming Village, Middle Zhongzheng Road. Chairman Pan Gongzhan, Vice Chairman Xu Jiyun (the former chairman of the Provisional City Council), and Xi Yushu, the vice chairman of the Provisional City Council, arrived on time. After the former Chairman Xu personally handed over the seals and other items to Chairman Pan for acceptance, Xu and Xi briefly explained the work of the Provisional City Council over the past four months, talking for about an hour. Chairman Pan immediately announced Xiang Changquan as the Secretary-General. Xu and Xi left first because they had to attend important meetings. Then, Chairman Pan gathered all the staff of the secretariat for a brief speech, which ended at around 6 PM.

### Lush Green Mountains and Flowers Competing for Beauty; Horticultural Exhibition Initially Shows Its Colors

[Special report from this newspaper] Summer is a season without flowers, but the Shanghai Horticultural Improvement Association chose this hot summer to hold a horticultural exhibition, which gave people an excellent impression.

The horticultural exhibition held its opening ceremony at 4 PM yesterday in Fuxing Park. Although the heat was oppressive, no one wanted to miss this good opportunity. Mayor Wu's wife, Construction Bureau Director Zhao Zukang, Social Bureau Director Wu Kaixian, Huang Laiyuan, the owner of Huang Garden, Qian Weifan, the secretary of the Construction Bureau, reporters from various newspapers, and more than 20 other people rushed to the scene. Zou Shuwen, the authoritative Dean of the Agricultural College of Zhongda University, also arrived at around 5 PM.

The exhibition was held in the old zoo in Fuxing Park. Walking through the gate, one can see the nine-cornered rockery garden designed by Zhongshan Park and the Fourth Nursery. The rockery is decorated with phoenix palms with sixty years of history, and the surrounding area is lined with silk-colored mountain grass, which is indeed lush and moving. The only thing lacking is the color of wildflowers, which makes people feel too monotonous.

To the left of the rockery is the small residential garden design. A model of a well-made small bungalow stands on a small lawn. The small bungalow is specially designed for couples to organize a small family. The house has two floors. The ground floor has a reception room, reading room, storage room, kitchen, cloakroom, etc. The second floor has two bedrooms, a bathroom, and a rest room. The garden has a pavilion, garage, pool, turntable, etc. The design is thoughtful and meets all ideals. It's a pity that the pie in the sky cannot satisfy hunger. In today's serious housing shortage, I am afraid that even a question about the garage is hard to come by!

Across from the small garden, there are many cacti and potted plants of three hexagonal mountain grasses, as well as cactus boards, cactus balls, cactus mountains, etc., all named according to their shape. These plants have always grown on shady mountains and are not used to sunlight. Therefore, after each major exhibition, they must be immersed in water. The most numerous in the bonsai are pines and cypresses. They all have fifty or sixty years of history, but they are subject to artificial suppression (usually tied tightly with ropes) so that they can only grow in small pots forever as human entertainment.

Walking along the road is the vegetable garden designed by the Shanghai Experimental Farm of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the plant specimens designed by Nantong University. In the vegetable garden, there are pumpkins, cucumbers, watermelons, tomatoes, eggplants, walnuts, and cucumbers. Among them, the most endearing ones are tomatoes and eggplants. These plants have been carefully cultivated by experts, and after all, they are different from ordinary plants, each one big and cute.

Finally, what should be recommended to all sectors is the "flower processing" designed by the Fourth Nursery, including flower arrangements, flower baskets, gardens, etc. Among them, the "Peacock Spreading Its Tail" is the most novel and elegant. The peacock's wings are made of palm leaves, with pink iris flowers in the middle. From a distance, it looks like a live peacock spreading its tail.

Summer is originally a season without flowers. Among the few flowers that exist, the lotus is the most precious. It is heard that experts who study flower books can use artificial temperature to make it bloom within a few minutes. In addition, gladioli, dahlias, cockscomb flowers, etc. are all relatively common and worthless. If a flower crown made of cockscomb flowers and marigolds is used, including labor costs, it will only cost one or two thousand yuan in total. Even a flower basket made purely of gladioli will not cost more than five or six thousand yuan. However, the flower baskets currently sold by flower shops on the market cost at least ten thousand yuan, which shows the general high profit.

The Shanghai Horticultural Improvement Association's ability to achieve such good results is by no means accidental. Cheng Shifu, the director of the farm management office, his daughter Miss Cheng Xuyu, General Manager Miss Wang Xin, etc., have all rushed for several night jobs. Their hard work has been appreciated by people yesterday. Mayor Wu's wife said: Since I came to Shanghai, I have always felt the tense and turbid air in Shanghai. I have never had such a fresh and comfortable feeling as today. This feeling is very beneficial to physical and mental health. I hope that all the wives in the city can pay attention to the decoration of flowers and plants. Growing potted plants in the house is very hygienic.

The person in charge of the Horticultural Improvement Association unanimously expressed regret that there were no good flowers to decorate. They will wait for the flowering season to come again. If gardening enthusiasts are not satisfied this time, they have to look forward to it.

### Obstructed from Boarding Foreign Ships; Unable to Return Home; Dispute on the Beihai Wheel Has Not Been Resolved

[Report from this newspaper] The Taikoo Company's Beihai Wheel could not set sail due to disputes caused by passengers boarding the ship. The previous day, after the Customs Port Police Station sent personnel to the ship to advise, most passengers left the ship after the ticket office refunded their tickets. However, there are still more than 200 people remaining on board, some of whom are refugees who cannot survive in Java due to being hated and devastated by the Dutch East Indies natives, some are righteous people who have returned from various parts of the Great Rear, and some are poor people who urgently need to return to their hometowns. They have been waiting for a ship in Shanghai for a long time: most of their travel expenses have been used up. If they disembark and wait for a ship to return to their hometowns in the uncertain future, it will cost seven or eight thousand yuan a day for food and lodging in Shanghai, and they will likely fall into destitution in Shanghai and never be able to return to their hometowns. Therefore, they hope that a Chinese ship can immediately take them back north. The Customs sent personnel to advise again yesterday afternoon, emphasizing the importance of national sovereignty. Before the authorities have a definitive solution, some passengers firmly refuse to leave the ship, so the ship still could not depart yesterday. It is still difficult to determine whether it can be resolved today.

Desheng Crew Demands Pay Raise

The Seamen's Union sent personnel to the company yesterday to negotiate with the British manager.

### Shanghai All-Star Basketball Team to Embark on US Tour; Approved by Minister of Education Zhu; Qian Xucang to Lead Departure in Mid-October

The Shanghai Mayor's Cup champion, the US Army 3198th Signal Basketball Team, after returning to the United States, in view of the strong strength of the Shanghai national team and the excellence of individual skills, which are no less than those of the Americans, specially sent the team's coach, Mr. Fudian, to Shanghai to contact Qian Xucang, chairman of the Basketball Committee, to invite Mr. Qian to organize the Shanghai All-Star Basketball Team to go to the United States for training and observation, and to compete in various cities. All travel expenses will be borne by the US military authorities. The Physical Education Association, after discussion, unanimously agreed that this move can indeed enhance the friendship between China and the United States, enable the American people to generally understand the current situation of sports in China, and the World Games will be held soon, so our basketball players can also take this opportunity to receive training in preparation. Therefore, Chairman Qian, for the sake of prudence, went to Beijing the day before to meet with Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua, who believed that this move could indeed improve the level of basketball * movement in our country, so he approved it immediately and appointed Qian Xucang as the team leader. At the same time, he has consulted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to issue departure passports. The team plans to leave the country in mid-October, first go to California for a month of training, and then go to major cities to compete, travel to the United States for about six months, and will not be able to return to China until May next year. The team roster will be announced in the near future. It is found that the level of various sports in our country has always been low. Only basketball and football can compete with the world's * heroes. However, the results of the last participation in the World Games were disastrous. The root cause lies in the lack of adequate preparation beforehand and the lack of opportunities for long-distance observation. Digging a well when thirsty and building a car behind closed doors, how can we compete with various countries? This time, the Shanghai All-Star Basketball Team has been invited to go abroad for a long journey across the Pacific Ocean, which is truly an unprecedented event in the sports world of our country.

### City District Mediation Committee: Organizational Regulations Passed; City Government to Instruct All Districts to Comply

In February of this year, the Municipal Government's Civil Affairs Bureau, in order to eliminate disputes among citizens in various districts and mediate civil disputes, drafted the Shanghai City District Mediation Committee Organizational Regulations based on the Organizational Regulations of Township Mediation Committees promulgated by the Ministry of Judicial Administration and the Ministry of Interior, and in consideration of the actual conditions of this city. Subsequently, due to the extremely complicated matters such as the election of city councilors in various districts, the review of public office qualifications, and the establishment of public opinion organs, the establishment was temporarily postponed. Recently, district representatives' assemblies in various districts have been established one after another, and they have requested the establishment of district mediation committees. At the same time, the Ministry of Interior has issued a general order requiring the widespread establishment of such committees to alleviate the deficiencies of the courts. Due to the needs of the situation, the bureau submitted a signed request to Mayor Wu, which was passed at yesterday's 43rd municipal meeting, and will soon instruct all districts to comply, it is said.

Twenty Districts' Central Locations Approved for Establishment of Postal Branch Offices

The 20th District (Yangshupu) had previously requested the Municipal Government to forward a letter to the Postal Administration Headquarters, requesting the establishment of a branch office or agency in the central location of the district, as the district is located in the eastern part of Shanghai, where factories are densely populated and the number of letters exchanged is increasing daily. It is now learned that the Postal Administration Bureau has replied to the Municipal Government approving the request. However, due to the serious housing shortage and difficulty in renting houses, it will be opened as soon as suitable housing is found, it is said.

Eighth District Adds Literacy Classes

The Eighth District Office (Xujiahui) convened a joint symposium on promoting the first phase of education for out-of-school citizens at the Tushanwan Orphanage at 9:00 a.m. on the 15th (the day before yesterday), bringing together all public and private elementary school principals and bao chiefs in the district. The meeting was chaired by Ying Yexiang, director of the Culture Section. As a result of the discussion, it was decided that all elementary schools in the district would be responsible for adding a total of 20 literacy classes for citizens, and each baojia chief would be responsible for investigating out-of-school citizens and persuading them to enroll, and August 16 was set as the start date.

Twenty-Fourth District Builds Assembly Hall

The District Representatives Assembly of the 24th District (Dachang) of this city believes that the district urgently needs to add an assembly hall. After submitting it to the first representatives' assembly for discussion, it was resolved to handle it jointly with the Dachang Primary and Secondary School Construction Committee. Furthermore, since the district was brought under municipal administration, the Education Bureau has spared no effort in promoting national education, but due to limited funds, it has not yet been popularized. It is proposed to request the Education Bureau to consider increasing the number of bao national schools to accommodate out-of-school children, which has also been resolved and submitted to the Education Bureau for approval.

### Household Registration Laws and Regulations: Questions and Answers Regarding Doubts

(14) Question: People mostly use the lunar calendar, but the national calendar must be used when filling out forms, which makes it very difficult to fill out forms. How should this be handled?

Answer: Temporarily fill in the lunar calendar.

(15) Question: Article 16 of the County Baojia Household Registration Investigation Measures stipulates that "the name of the bao shall be determined by numbers and may be prefixed with a place name." If prefixed with a place name, it is easy to cause misunderstanding. How should this be handled?

Answer: Fill in the bao number first, then note the place name.

(16) Question: When township household registration personnel perform household registration or personal registration, are they only registering based on the application form? Do they have the authority to investigate the facts filled in on the application form? If there is a false report, can they refuse to register?

Answer: Article 11 of the Household Registration Law stipulates the recusal of the household registration director, and Article 12 stipulates the compensation of the household registration director, both of which are intended to prevent the abuse of power by the household registration director. Therefore, the household registration director has the power to investigate the application form and refuse to register those who falsely report.

### Brief News from Various Districts

The 22nd District Office (Jiangwan) held its second bao cadre meeting at 9:00 a.m. yesterday (the 15th). The meeting was convened by Li Yongge, director of the Civil Affairs Section. Each bao cadre reported a summary of their work in the past half-month. The investigation of impoverished households and the registration of out-of-school citizens were discussed in detail. Furthermore, the district's Agricultural Association recently received many packages of vegetable seeds from the Jiangwan branch of the Shanghai Experimental Economic Farm and distributed them to the association's members.

The 14th District (Zhabei) requested the installation of a public tap water station in the fourth bao. The Municipal Government had previously instructed the Public Works Bureau to send personnel to investigate and consult with the Shanghai Zhabei Water and Electricity Company. If residents can afford the installation and monthly water charges, they can apply to the company for installation. As for residents applying to install retail water taps, the Public Works Bureau has approved six locations, which can also supply the needs of some common people.

### Speculative Gangs Stir Up Trouble; Black Market for Public Bonds Continues to Soar; Old Bulls Take the Opportunity to Release Actual Goods

Public bonds, under speculative activities, have started a rising trend. The abnormal phenomenon of the "Tongbing" bond soaring has reappeared. Gangs gathered, and trading was unusually lively. Although "Tongbing" initially opened at 1,500 yuan in the morning and fell to 1,400 yuan, idle funds were stirred up, manipulators thrived, and profiteering occurred. Buying momentum increased again, and high prices reached 1,900 yuan. General long-term holders and those with small sums continuously released actual goods, and finally the price fell back to below 1,550 yuan. The difference between miscellaneous brands was again large. "Jiayi" and "Yi" failed to regain the 1,000 yuan level and ended weakly. "Dingwu" also moved from high to low. The gangs did not show excitement. Speculative forces could only push up "Tongbing." The difference between the bonds was huge. Those who harbored extravagant hopes did not know how to explain themselves. As a result, the closing price was about the same as the previous day for "Jiayi" and "Yi", "Bingzhong" alone rose by 250 yuan, and "Dingwu" rose slightly by 100 yuan. The price difference between the bonds widened again, and the trend was still fluctuating.

### Opinions of Legal Scholars: Increasing or Decreasing Periodic Payments is Not Legally Inappropriate; Whether a Thousandfold Increase is Appropriate Can Be Considered; Public Bonds Have Their Own Regulations

[Report from this Newspaper] A reporter recently consulted with Zhang Zhengxue, a legal authority on civil law, regarding the fixed deposit case published in yesterday's newspaper, seeking guidance: After a contract is signed, if circumstances change, resulting in a significant imbalance in the agreed rights and obligations, can those rights and obligations also be changed? This is a major legal question. In ancient Roman law, the principle was strict adherence to contracts, and changes were not allowed. However, in canon law, there were exceptions that allowed for changes, which scholars called the "rule of changed circumstances," especially advocated by scholars of international law. Although modern civil laws in various countries still follow the provisions of Roman law as a principle, they all have some exceptions. China's eight-year War of Resistance against Japan caused great changes in the economy. If all previous contracts were strictly enforced according to the agreement, it would violate the principle of fairness and justice. Therefore, Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations on Handling Civil Lawsuits After Recovery, promulgated on December 18 last year, contains provisions (see yesterday's newspaper). The judgment in the case of the Four Banks Savings Association deposit case was based on this provision. Therefore, legally speaking, it does not seem to be inappropriate. However, whether a thousandfold increase is fair or appropriate should be determined based on the specific circumstances of the case. Moreover, since one party has already appealed, it still awaits a final and definitive ruling. However, in other cases, it will not necessarily be bound by this multiple. As for public bonds, they have separate regulations and cannot be compared; the disturbances in the public bond market are merely the old tricks of speculation.

### Defendant Has Filed an Appeal; Association Requests Instructions

The Bankers Association believes that this situation is of great importance to the entire member banks and the entire city's financial industry. The events that have occurred are not limited to the Four Banks Savings Association alone. Therefore, it has submitted its opinions on legal principles and facts to the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance, requesting clear regulations. The association has already sold out on the 15th. According to financial industry insiders, the government has no explicit regulations on deposits made during wartime versus before the war. The deposits absorbed by various banks were mostly used for deposit reserves and expenditures. It is unreasonable to repay them at ordinary multiples. The Four Banks Savings Association has hired lawyers to file an appeal based on the court's judgment, the Ministry of Finance's order to pay deposits, and the grounds that it cannot repay according to indices.

### Gold Certificates are Stable

The price of gold certificates has been stable and constant. It initially opened at around 1.95 million in the morning. After opening, buyers were concerned and the market was quite stable. It briefly rose to over 1.957 million, but buying momentum stopped when prices rose high. Soon, it entered a period of fluctuation. After 10:00 a.m., the Central Bank allocated 0 units at a price of 1.9475 million. Afterwards, it fell to below 1.945 million. Finally, due to unusually loose monetary conditions, those holding funds inevitably made some purchases, and the price steadily stood at 1.95 million at noon. The market was slightly stable in the afternoon. As a result, the closing price was 9,000 higher than the previous day. Gold ornaments, silver bullion, and silver dollars remained unchanged. The implicit interest rate was loose, and the asking price was still at nine fen to one jiao two, with supply falling short of demand.

Foreign currencies also showed a stable trend. The morning opening price was 2,560 yuan with sellers, and the fluctuation range was very narrow with little trading. The low price was 2,540 yuan, and then it stabilized. At noon, it fluctuated around 2,550 yuan, and the market was slightly stable in the afternoon with slightly higher asking prices. As a result, the closing price was 5 yuan higher than the previous day. The stock of Hong Kong dollars was limited and could not withstand purchases, so the closing price could rise by 5 yuan from the previous day. The exchange rate was 552 yuan for Hong Kong dollars, 663 yuan for Indian rupees, and 8,840 yuan for British pounds with sellers. The exchange rate for US dollars remained unchanged.

### Taiwan Black Tea Supply is Low; White-Headed Experts Have Increasing Appetite

In the recent foreign tea market, experts have shown an increasing appetite for Taiwan fine black tea. Unfortunately, the source of this variety has been slow to arrive, and local companies such as Wang Yutai, Wu Chang, Jiang Tea, and Xinhua Tea have been acquiring it. The situation continues to be stable. As for domestic sales of black and green tea, they remain prosperous, so buyers do not hesitate and purchase vigorously. People are firm and undaunted. According to industry sources, the current stock of various varieties in this city is not abundant. Those who are interested plan to ship them from the producing areas to Shanghai. Based on the current situation, there may be a considerable amount of spot goods flowing into the market in the coming days.

### Tianjin Soybean Cake and Coal Arrive in Shanghai

[Report from this Newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hanmin ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, carrying 15,000 pieces of soybean cake and 5,000 bags of straw-packed coal from Tianjin. Yesterday, the Haixia ship sailed to Tianjin for the first time, carrying more than 3,860 bags of wheat, 2,280 boxes of tea, 480 pieces of cotton yarn, 10 barrels of tung oil, 200 pieces of cotton yarn and cotton cloth, 348 pieces of hemp bags, and more than 3,000 pieces of sundries, totaling approximately 2,600 tons.

### 266 Securities Exchange Brokers Selected

[Report from this Newspaper] The Securities Exchange convened its 11th full committee meeting at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. After four and a half hours of discussion, 266 brokers were selected from more than 500 applications, deemed to be qualified brokers. Of these, 60 are legal entities (foreign legal entities account for about a dozen), and the remaining 206 are individual brokers. It is reported that the selected list will be submitted to the ministry for approval tomorrow, and it is expected to be approved and announced within about a week.

### Yarn Market is Stable and Elegant; Cotton Cloth Turns Down

Yesterday, the yarn market was stable and elegant. "Shuangma" still fluctuated between 1.335 million. Tianjin merchants made slight purchases of "Hongxing" from Dasheng Factory and "Riguang" from Fangjian Factory. Sales in South China were still limited, so people were not very happy. The rise and fall of various brands were mixed. At noon, Fangjian Company opened sales of yarn and did not supply or sell to 42 large packages, so the double-strand thread in the dare market was particularly firm, with prices as high as 120,000, but not much trading occurred. The price of plain cloth fell because of sluggish customer sales. The downward trend became more intense. At the same time, Fangjian Company sold a huge amount, resulting in an abundance of chips in the market. Moreover, the delivery deadline had arrived, and there was no power to transfer funds, so they cut prices to close positions. The market continued to fall by 500 yuan to 1,250 yuan.

### Hardware Prices Fall

Hardware orders have arrived, and prices have plummeted. Sales of large hardware are particularly sluggish. The season for green iron wire mesh has passed, and the price is 100,000 yuan lower than the peak. Belt buckles have fallen from 10,000 yuan to 6,500 yuan per box. Artificial abrasive cloth has fallen by 20,000 yuan per ream. The market is becoming more sluggish as prices fall. Everyone is eagerly hoping that the authorities will find a reasonable solution.

### Longs Continue to Emerge; Chinese Stocks Still Cannot Escape Sluggishness

Chinese stocks, after being repeatedly cut by major players and shorted, could not recover. Yesterday, the market was initially stable and then sluggish, ending with low prices. After opening, Yongsheng was at 660 yuan, Meiya at 3,680 yuan, Jingfu and Xinguang were both at 215 yuan, and Qinxing was at 160 yuan. These prices were all the highest prices. After a difficult struggle in the middle, a major player from China Red Customer and a certain number on the sixth floor of the Securities Building released more than 3 million shares, so cutting longs started again. At noon, new low prices were created. Yongsheng was at 625 yuan, Meiya at 3,330 yuan, Jingfu and Xinguang at 195 yuan, and Qin and Wu were already at 45 yuan. Cold stocks also fell slightly. Old stocks were relatively stable due to their own absorption. As a result, Yongsheng fell by 11 yuan, Meiya fell by half a percent, Jingfu and Xinguang fell slightly, and Qin and Wu slightly rose. The price of each cold stock was slightly lower by a small amount, and the price of old stock was more moderate.

Foreign stocks were continuously acquired by Sichuan merchants and securities merchants, but eventually the rapid advance was followed by a reaction. When prices were high, there were many closings. Therefore, Yisheng rose and fell rapidly. After opening at 8,700 yuan in the morning, it rose to 9,200 yuan, and then fell back to 8,400 yuan in the middle. The market was still relatively stable, fluctuating above the previous closing price. As a result, Yisheng, English Union, and Yibier rose slightly compared with the previous day. Yeguang and Yazhou continued to rise by half a percent. Huidengfeng Steel was flat, and the paper industry fell back by a weak 10%.

### Foreign Rice Continues to be Rationed; High Quality Rice Remains in Short Supply

Yesterday, 3,000 to 4,000 shi of rice arrived in the north and south rice markets. High-quality rice was still in short supply, and medium-quality rice was still the majority. High-quality rice killed medium-quality rice. Another 11,900 bags of foreign rice were rationed. There was not much new high-quality rice. The market remained stable. Baiyuan also became a situation of high price for the best and sluggish for the lower. High-quality goods were actively bought and sold, with a premium of 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, while lower-quality goods remained sluggish and had little trading. Flour sales were still acceptable, and the market was firm. Foreign flour was sold a lot, and there were six or seven types, all of which were Canadian flour. Small packages were actively sold, but stores were unwilling to buy double packages. Although northern merchants bought white wheat, the appetite was not as strong as it had been in the previous few days. Shantou and Xiamen were moving but not prosperous. High-quality goods barely stood firm, and medium-quality goods still fell by 200 to 300 yuan. The market for soybeans was stable with a slight soft tendency. Broad beans were unable to rise. Shipments from Shantou and supplies from water plants were continuously suspended. Stores were waiting and watching. The market continued to fall by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Soybean cake rose slightly by 100 yuan due to slight sales in Shantou. Bean curd skin sales were active, with a premium of 100 to 200 yuan.

### Medium Sand White Returns to Slackness

Yesterday, the sugar market was slackening because the company's allocated raw sugar to sugar merchants was larger. The opening price of Medium Sand White was slacker, down more than 10,000 yuan from the previous day. Chaoqing was handled by Ningbo merchants. The opening price for Tiqing was 98,000 yuan to 96,000 yuan, a total of more than 200 packages. 50 boxes of Shimenpianqing were 83,000 yuan. 100 packages of Hainan Red were 114,000 yuan. The opening price of Shangdiaoqing was 91,000 yuan to 90,000 yuan, and 89,500 yuan for lower grades. 200 to 300 packages were traded.

### Managing State-Owned Enterprises

Ministry of Economic Affairs Invited Relevant Ministries and Commissions to Confer

[Report from this Newspaper in Nanjing on the 15th] The number of state-owned enterprises in our country has increased, and the management urgently needs to establish a system. Last year, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek ordered Song Ziwen, Weng Wenhao, Wu Dingchang, and Chu Minyi to formulate a regulatory plan, which has been approved. The Ministry of Economic Affairs specially invited the Ministries of Finance, Transportation, Food, and Education, and the Resources Committee yesterday to jointly discuss and formulate the "State-Owned Enterprise Management Law" based on the plan to determine the personnel, accounting, organization, system, management methods, and the division of powers between the competent authorities and the main building authorities of state-owned enterprises, so as to promote the development of state-owned enterprises under the principle of the government supporting private enterprises.

### White Coal Market is Gradually Improving

Since the price of white coal briquettes in the coal market was reported to have risen from the place of origin, the owners have been hoarding goods on the pretext of seeking higher prices, so the recent trend has been quite strong. All other goods are supplied on demand, and the market is consistently standing firm at the original level. The arrival of Ta 탄 [type of coal] is excessive, but actual sales are still ordinary, so the market is also weak and fatigued.

### More American-Bound Bristles

[Reuters News Agency, New York, 16th] Recently, the arrival of American-bound hog bristles has been more prosperous, and prices are weaker than during the war. The wartime Asset Management Bureau currently holds more than one million pounds of hog bristle inventory. It is expected that this inventory will be sold at a fixed price within one month. It is said that its quality is better than that of current imported goods, and manufacturers are willing to pay a high price to purchase it.

### Golden Needles Rebound

The market for Golden Needles has seen a slight turnaround, because the quality of the current arrivals is drier than before, and the price of Zhenjiang reeds has also rebounded by 20,000 yuan. Therefore, the long-fatigued vegetable market has a hope of rebounding.

### Yan Chamber of Commerce and Senate Petition Group Plead to Save the Industrial and Commercial Crisis

[Report from this Newspaper in Nanjing on the 15th] The Wuhu Chamber of Commerce and Senate Petition Group arrived in Beijing a few days ago. According to the person in charge of the group, the purpose of this trip is to (1) request the Ministry of Finance to approve a loan of 8 billion yuan to save the industrial and commercial crisis in Wuhu, (2) request the Ministry of Economic Affairs to return the privately-owned factories occupied by the enemy during the occupation period. Those that were taken over by the Ministry of Economic Affairs after victory are requested to be returned, and (3) request the Ministry of Transportation to speed up the restoration of the Jiangnan Railway as soon as possible. The petition group has visited the Ministries of Economic Affairs, Finance, Transportation, Interior, and the Executive Yuan. The Executive Yuan has approved the loan to be forwarded to the Four Joint Offices for handling, so the petition result is still satisfactory.

### American Goods of Reduced Cost only Enough for Capital; Bleaching Powder has Difficulty in Production and Sales; Although the United States Rejected the Order for Caustic Soda, Various Sources Have Not Been Interrupted

[Report from this Newspaper] In the recent dye and raw material market, it is still stable. Several types of goods are close to cost and have a rebounding trend. The current price of 693 American reduced cost is 1.24 million. The order requires US$0.50 per pound, plus the correct costs and tips, which is only enough for capital. The BG commodity has a large number of arrivals, and the order customers can not afford the capital interest expenses, and are eager to sell, and the price see-saw smaller. The current price is 880,000. American reduced alkali is turned from weak to firm, currently 37,000. It is always that the arrival of capital has a considerable foundation, and holders are unwilling to reduce their capital. Caustic soda is 440,000. According to port traders, the United States has rejected the order, which should be able to strengthen it. The current market price of American bleaching powder is 29,000, and bleaching essence is 160,000. The fatigue of the market is the most of various raw materials, and bleaching essence is actually brought in by bleaching powder. It is said that there has not been a single order that is not losing money recently. The volume is quite large, and the labor costs after the goods ship to the port are considerable. The nature of the goods is not easy to store, especially in summer and winter. Domestic bleaching powder in this city is selling at a large discount, and where do foreign goods make money? According to a chemical manufacturing authority, during the wartime, people used small and medium-sized investments to manufacture bleached powder for the market. Since the continued arrival of foreign goods, this industry has long been defeated. Some factories still use bleaching powder as the main product, such as monosodium glutamate and weimu factories. Due to the manufacturing process and equipment, bleaching powder is continuously produced as a by-product. There is no way to promote it, and it must be disposed of like garbage to pay a disposal fee, which is really impossible. It also said that a certain large factory has adopted a gift method, entrusting vacant ships to carry gifts to the Guangdong Provincial Government for the purpose of aiding a certain cause. It is found that the import of foreign goods has recently incurred excessive costs of RSD, and the arrival capital has already increased. Moreover, domestic bleaching powder has no place to stand, which is quite noteworthy. Although there is news that the United States has rejected the caustic soda order, Manila and Hong Kong are said to have stocks, and direct shipments from the inner door to the United States can also continue. Generally, it can still be supplied to the market. According to people from the Taiwanese industry, at the beginning of the recovery, there was liquid caustic soda shipped to Shanghai. At this time, this city was cut off and the price was as high as more than one million, which helped a lot. Now, the Taiwan area no longer has this manufacturing work and must purchase from this city and transport solid caustic soda to it. After inquiring about this news from people in the raw material industry, it is also said to be true, but it is said that there have been no shipments recently. An authority on the import industry pointed out that the fees for foreign goods arriving at the port are high, and the theft and return is high. Moreover, both the mines and warehouses are lacking. The longer it is delayed, the more terrible it is. Those with large volume and low value suffer from high freight costs, while those with small size and high price are damaged by large-scale theft. Agents and owners are all exhausted. It also said that the recently criticized RSD is a general term for receiving, storing, and picking up goods. The agent's expenses are too high and must be settled with the customer, which is regrettable. People familiar with the situation say that the cost of living is too high now, and the wind of theft is so high. The agent is responsible for the business and the cost is inevitably heavy. However, there are also a few people who take this opportunity to increase the charging fee, and the intention may be to prevent the cost of postage. The burden on the order customer will inevitably be too often. According to well-informed sources, the customs and municipal authorities have paid close attention to this. The power to crack down on smuggling is not unified and still needs to be reformed. It is said that the trade representative delegation to Beijing discussed this matter with the Customs Service, and the office stated that it would use effective methods to rectify discipline.

### Ascending to the Summit of Tianmu Mountain

— Our Hangzhou Dispatch on the 9th, Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng

Tianmu Mountain's fame dates back to before the Han Dynasty. The "Taiping Huanyu Ji" states: "The mountains and waters twist east and west, with springs resembling two eyes, hence the name Tianmu." During the Liang Dynasty, Prince Zhaoming passed through this mountain and washed his eyes in the springs, clearing one eye. Later, he passed West Mountain and washed his eyes again, fully restoring his sight. Therefore, Zhuangzi called it 'Dou Qing,' and the mountain 'Tianmu.'" The "Yuanhe Zhi" also states: "Tianmu has two peaks, each with a pond on its summit, facing each other, hence the name." The "Yitong Zhi" says: "Below the mountain are two ponds, like left and right eyes." Popular legend also says: "Prince Zhaoming of Liang, while reading scriptures, lost his sight and regained it by washing in the pond's water, hence the name Tianmu." In any case, Tianmu Mountain is indeed related to the talented Prince Zhaoming of Liang. The artistic and literary works praising Tianmu Mountain are truly countless. Xu Shiying, the old gentleman, once said, "Zhejiang has many beautiful mountains and waters, such as Wuling Mountain and Fuchun Mountain in Hangzhou, Kuocang Mountain in Quzhou, Kuaiji Mountain in Shaoxing, Yandang Mountain in Wenzhou, Tiantai Mountain in Taizhou, and North Mountain in Jinhua, all famous throughout the country, mostly known for their sparse beauty, seclusion, and vastness. None are as majestic, unique, and towering as Tianmu Mountain." One can imagine the value of Tianmu Mountain among mountains and waters.

(1) A Majestic Sacred Site

The reporter departed from Hangzhou on August 5th, passed through Yuhang and Lin'an, bypassed Tianmu Mountain, and went directly to Changhua. Then, he turned back to enter Tianmu Mountain, indicating a deeper admiration for the mountain. This clarifies the actual situation of the four counties under the protection of Tianmu Mountain. The enemy never came to Tianmu Mountain. Although they invaded several counties near western Zhejiang, this mountain always maintained its sanctity. Only after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the "New Fourth Army" had been here; later, the Loyal and Patriotic Army came, the "New Fourth Army" fought a battle and retreated. During the Anti-Japanese War, Tianmu Mountain shouldered the important task of training cadres and strong men from Zhejiang Province. The Zhejiang Provincial Training Corps was located on this mountain, and the Western Zhejiang Administrative Office was also located in Yuqian, not far from here. The enemy bombed several times, destroying the majestic halls, but the training work continued under the protection of the mountain. It can be said that it made significant contributions during the Anti-Japanese War.

Before the war, Tianmu Mountain was also a popular summer resort. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, accompanied by Yan Xishan and Huang Shaohong, visited in 1936; Madam Chiang Kai-shek also accompanied them. Comparing it to Mogan Mountain, as Shen Honglie said, "Mogan Mountain can only be described as a 'delicate young lady,' while Tianmu Mountain is a majestic man."

(2) Only Ten Temple Buildings Remain

I arrived at Yao Creek, 18 kilometers away, on the morning of the 7th, and then traveled 20 kilometers from Zao Creek to the foot of Tianmu Mountain. On the way from Zao Creek to the mountain, I saw it towering high, majestic and extraordinary, inspiring a sense of awe. However, when I got closer, it didn't seem so special anymore. We gradually ascended, and at the small ridge, looking down, we saw dense trees. Descending along the steps, we felt increasingly relaxed and happy. Huge trees embraced, interspersed with verdant bamboos. Arriving at Panlong Bridge and passing Panlong Pavilion, the stream hit the rocks and sounded like monks chanting Buddhist scriptures. At this moment, it seemed as if we were already approaching a fairyland. Arriving at Qianyuan Temple, the monks told us that this temple originally had more than 500 rooms, but more than 400 were destroyed by enemy planes, and now only a few dozen remain. There were originally thousands of Buddhist statues, but only two Bodhisattvas, Weituo and Maitreya, were donated. The original monk population was more than 600, but now there are only more than 60. The temple is built in the middle of two high peaks, surrounded by mountains on three sides. Behind the temple, a line of trees stands tall.

Coming out of Qianyuan Temple, the right mountain is the Eye-Washing Pond. The pond is shaped like a well. Legend says that Prince Zhaoming suffered from eye disease while studying and regained his sight by scooping water from the pond to wash his eyes. Climbing the mountain again, the trees on both sides of the stone steps are solemn and ancient, and the stones are covered with vines, with bright colors. Climbing three miles to Yicui Pavilion, we saw houses scattered along the road, all unrepaired and gradually decaying. These were the houses originally built for the Zhejiang Cadre Training Institute during the war.

(3) Exploring the Mountain Top

Climbing further up to Cuiwei Peak, a stone soars into the clouds. Ancient fir trees line the path, creating a magnificent scene, and the mountain becomes increasingly high and steep. Looking down, white clouds gradually rise. Arriving at Xin Fu (New Wife) Stone, about five zhang high, it faces the Xin Lang (New Groom) Stone of East Tianmu, and is also known as Wang Fu (Waiting for Husband) Stone. Advancing to Rusi Pavilion, we had already climbed five miles. Beside the pavilion is a bridge called Qingliang (Cool) Bridge, with scattered rocks, rapid mountain streams, and beautiful spring sounds. Arriving at Bell Tower Stone, the stone is more than seven zhang high on the hillside. Before the war, a bell was placed on the stone, and old monks struck the bell to pray to Buddha. Arriving at Qili (Seven Li) Pavilion, it had collapsed, leaving only some broken pillars and remnants of wood. We turned to Lion's Mouth, where there are several low-roofed houses. Visitors must pass through the houses. Behind the houses is the burial place of Zen Master Gaofeng. Passing the houses, we were in a mountain depression. Looking into the distance, many mountain ranges were already below our feet. Climbing further to Washing Bowl Pond, there is a scoop of water under an ancient tree, which is said to never dry up during droughts, and was the place where Zen Master Gaofeng washed his bowl in the past. Also reaching the Great Tree King, this tree is ancient and huge, different from other trees. It can be embraced by five and a half people. In the past, people from far and wide peeled the bark to take back, saying it could cure diseases. Now, the monks have built a low wall to protect it. In front of the tree is a stone tablet inscribed with the three characters "Great Tree King," written by Yu Youren. Traversing the forest, we reached the Old Hall of Mountain Opening. The walls of the hall are painted white, and the Bodhisattvas inside are not very large. After the Anti-Japanese War, the Loyal and Patriotic Army was stationed here. We had already climbed ten miles to get here.

We asked the monks how much further it was to climb to the mountain ridge. He said there were still eight miles. In order to explore the ultimate scenery, we decided to climb to the ridge of Tianmu Mountain. However, no one had visited the mountain ridge for a long time, so we didn't know whether the road was easy to walk. In fact, it had a bit of an adventurous nature, as the old monk told us.

(4) Distant View from the Immortal Summit

After starting to climb to the summit, there were no more large trees, simply because the mountain was high and the climate cold, making it difficult for them to grow. The road was indeed difficult to walk, with weeds up to our knees and the mountain path difficult to discern. It was also said that there were bamboo pit vipers in the grass, whose venom was unparalleled, killing anyone bitten within seven steps. It was also said that there were tigers and wolves in the mountains, and that there were leeches that sucked blood. We supported each other with vines, carefully watching our steps, and gradually ascended. The trees on both sides seemed to be fruit trees, and the wildflowers were strange and of different shapes. Beside the mountain, there was a Podocarpus pine, coiled like a dragon, extending far out of the mountain into mid-air. Then we ascended to the place where the immortals sit. The mountain became higher, and the stones became more unique. Reaching the "Solution Stone Board," legend has it that the immortals dissolved the board in order to build an immortal bridge, but were unsuccessful. The large stone is like a screen, with pieces dissolved like sawed boards, and the marks are still fresh. Reaching the Four Immortals Platform, also known as Stone City, it is more than five zhang high and more than thirty zhang wide, circling like city walls. We are almost at the summit. Reaching the top, there is a huge stone tablet inscribed with the two characters "Xian Ding" (Immortal Summit). The Immortal Bridge has also arrived, with a stone slab placed on top of various stones. "Records of the Stone Screen" states: "The First Emperor of Qin split stones on Tianmu to make a bridge, and it is said that this is its ruins." From the Immortal Summit, the mountains are low beneath our feet, like small mounds. The Qiantang River is like money, and the cities cannot be distinguished. In the distance, there is a high mountain, probably Huangshan Mountain. There is also a high mountain nearby, which is East Tianmu. The other mountains are not as high as the waist of West Tianmu Mountain. Reaching here, our minds are open, and all worldly thoughts disappear, as if we have truly reached the "Immortal Summit."

After lingering for about twenty minutes, we returned along the original path and passed the Old Hall of Mountain Opening. Reaching East Mao Peak and West Mao Peak, we saw Half-Moon Pond. The pond is shaped like a half-moon, and it is said that it never dries up during droughts and never overflows during floods. Now, monks raise fish in it. Later, we reached the Inverted Lotus, and on the way, we saw many ancient pines. The Podocarpus pines and Pinus armandii pines were incredibly huge, stretching out their branches for dozens of zhang, solemn and majestic. We gradually reached the Inverted Lotus, and there was a pavilion on the mountainside. Gradually climbing down the stones, the peaks hang down below, lying down like lotus flowers. The mountain road is uneven, only allowing half a foot of space. If one loses their footing, it is a deep abyss of ten thousand zhang. I don't know where one's body would go? The dense shade under the peaks makes people feel quite dangerous. The monk told me that when Chairman Chiang came in the past, he descended the lotus peak. There were two stones about one zhang high, and the chairman jumped down as if walking on flat ground, but many of those who came with him did not dare to jump down. We climbed back up to Wangzhu Peak. The peak is sharp at the top and abundant at the bottom. Overlooking the Qiantang River like a belt, there are ancient pines that are more than a thousand years old. This place is most suitable for viewing the sea of clouds, because it is halfway up the mountain, below the summit.

(5) The Misdeeds of the "Fourth Master"

We returned to Qianyuan Temple along the original path and stayed overnight at Tianranju (Natural Residence), which is Pan Village, a modern building with modern facilities, built by Pan Zhiquan, a Shanghai businessman. Old Wei, the caretaker, was loyal to his duty. The minister of the New Fourth Army once lived here, and the caretaker argued for sovereignty, almost suffering disaster. According to Old Wei, "Dozens of brocade quilts, dozens of woolen blankets, and many other things were taken away by the 'Fourth Master.'"

Tianmu Mountain is indeed a summer resort. When we left, we told the old monk to properly organize the mountain roads, develop scenic spots, protect the mountain forests, and plant fruit trees.

Tianmu Mountain shouldered the important task of training and acting as a base of operations in Zhejiang during the Anti-Japanese War. We hope that in today's post-war era, it will not be forgotten and will become a summer resort.

### Tragic Situation in Jiangxi

— Nanchang Dispatch on the 6th, Liu Zao

Jiangxi has suffered from banditry for eight years and war disasters for eight years. Before 1934, more than two-thirds of the province's land was roamed and occupied by the communist army. For many years, the common people were anesthetized by the communists and blindly joined, losing their lives. How many honest farmers, young people, and gentry were regarded as "reactionaries" by the communist army and suffered tragically! The fact that the population statistics in Jiangxi's rural areas generally show more women than men is a debt of blood written by the communists in Jiangxi!

### Empty Provincial Treasury, High Material Prices

Wartime Jiangxi was a corner of the main battlefield of the Third and Ninth War Zones. The people of Jiangxi were honored to participate in countless glorious battles, such as the Wanjialing and Shanggao battles. According to the report of the military control area, Jiangxi sent 1.3 million young men to war. Calculating based on the province's population of 13 million, one in ten people, regardless of gender or age, directly participated in the war. Their families and people on the refugee line suffered the same hardships and went through eight years of disaster. Now that the war has been won, "suffering" still hangs in their hearts!

If you look at a colored map of the Jiangxi disaster area, the disaster situation in southeastern Jiangxi is not as serious as in the northwestern corner, but currently there are also other disasters - plague, cattle plague, cholera... attacking the ruined rural areas.

Now, although the new grain has come to market, news of a bumper harvest has also been broadcasted. However, the burden on the common people is too heavy. With the currently rising grain market and prices, it is impossible to make those on the hunger line feel the ease of the whip of life!

Looking at Jiangxi's provincial budget this year: the current salary of public school staff, calculated based on a base salary of 180 times and a living allowance of 35,000 yuan, the total provincial budget for the year is 12 billion yuan, while the figure approved by the central government is a weak 6.9 billion yuan, a difference of 5.1 billion yuan. If the price index increases further and the salaries of public school staff are adjusted again, then the arrears of the provincial treasury will be even more unimaginable!

The income and expenditure of the provincial treasury is currently a difficult hurdle - it cannot be connected. The provincial government plans to pre-sell the entire year's agricultural tax grain income to the central government to raise funds. This fully shows the "anemia" of Jiangxi's provincial finances.

### Extremely Serious County-Level Finances

The difficulties in county-level finances are even more serious. Taking Dean County on the Nanchang-Jiujiang line as an example, it had a population of 80,000 before the war. The current survey shows 34,451 people. This year's county funding budget is 70 million yuan. The method of raising funds is mainly through county business tax and slaughter tax. However, there are currently only 36 stores registered in the county town's chamber of commerce, engaged in the business of groceries and oil prices. Only one pig has been slaughtered in the past month. If the tax collection methods are truly implemented according to regulations, then all county-level agencies will have to "close down." The current solution for alleviating poverty with this tax revenue in various counties is to apportion it to each township. Taking Dean as an example: the county budget is 70 million, and the population is only over 34,000 people, with an average burden of more than 2,000 yuan per person for county expenses. In addition, they must also deal with countless township and baojia apportionments.

The soaring food prices directly affect people's lives and social order. Suicides due to economic hardship are not uncommon even in Nanchang, where the provincial capital is located. Riots of robbing rice and flour are constantly staged in Guangze, Linchuan, Leping, and Yichun. Robbery cases on the Nanchang-Jiujiang road have also occurred repeatedly.

Last year, the requisition of surplus grain forced Tianliang (Field Grain) Section Chief Cheng Maoxing to death. I am afraid that this year's agricultural tax quota will force many poor people to extend their begging hands.

### Please Issue Passports to Beg Elsewhere

Let's take Dean as an example.

The Dean County's agricultural tax register was lost during the war. The provincial Tianliang Department's quota for this year is 125,000 yuan. If calculated at 9 dou and 2.5 sheng per yuan, the total amount of tax collection, actual collection, and requisition in the county is 115,625 dan. Even with the result of Provincial Assembly Speaker Wang Zhenxin's appeal in Beijing to reduce the quota, calculated at 80%, Dean's agricultural tax quota is still 92,500 dan. The 34,451 people in the county must bear a grain tax quota of over 90,000 dan. Regardless of men, women, old, or young, each person should pay an agricultural tax of slightly less than 2.7 dan.

Today, when the old harvest is gone and the new harvest is not yet in, the people of Dean are forced to say to the county magistrate in order to cope with the military rations and horse feed for the garrisoned troops, "We don't want to be the people of Dean County. Please, County Magistrate, issue us passports to go beg for food in other counties!"

The county government of Dean County was unable to cope with the horse feed for the garrisoned troops and conducted a general survey together with the Chamber of Commerce and the Kuomintang Headquarters. The result showed that the city and suburbs of Dean only had 3,500 jin of brown rice in storage, which was only enough for the 3,200 people in the city for one day. The commander of the garrisoned troops saw this tragic situation and did not want to see the people run out of food, so he had to ask the province to find another solution.

Old Factory Workers Request to Return to Work

Editor: We are a group of workers from a weaving and dyeing factory on Binjiang Road. After December 8th, the factory used the name of lack of raw materials and dismissed us all regardless of everything. Now that the victory has come for more than a year, the factory's scope has also expanded compared to before, and a weaving factory has been added in the southern city. We all hoped that the authorities could give us our jobs back as soon as possible, but to our surprise, every time we applied to the factory in an individual capacity, we received only "perfunctory" and "delay." We have no savings and live from day to day. How can we wait every day! Moreover, the factory has recently added many new employees, so of course, old employees cannot be reinstated. Therefore, colleagues and others were forced to prepare a joint application, but in the process of planning, they received the factory's refusal. They used the excuse: you have been used to playing outside, and you may not be able to be dedicated to your work in the factory. This is truly laughable. We cannot leave the factory and wait at home to starve to death forever. Of course, we have to find a way to solve our lives. Who knew that this would be used as an excuse by the factory? We cannot understand what the intention is. In the past, someone published an article in the normal newspapers "Announcing to Colleagues of Hui Tai Factory" The content was to dismiss employees for unwarranted reasons. We can take this situation as a reference, because at that time the enemy had not yet taken over the concession, which is a common sense. We still do not understand the reason for refusing to reinstate the old employees now. We originally intended to send representatives to request reinstatement to the factory, because their past doctrine was "There are gold bars," which can defeat everything, so we can't do this. We can only ask

Sir, to give us guidance and leadership, so that we will not go down the road of unemployment, so colleagues and others humbly ask people from all walks of life for guidance, is his reason for refusal right or wrong, we have been unemployed so far, how do we live? (A group of unemployed workers liberated during the Anti-Japanese period respectfully)

The County Magistrate Arrives, the County Treasury is Empty

Another more tragic situation is the "no rice to cook" in the county's expenses and the county magistrate's work.

Xingzi County, with seven parts water, two parts mountains, and one part fields, can be seen to be poor from the deserted street scene. Recently, a new county magistrate took office, but the county treasury was as empty as it could be. The salaries owed to the staff have been in arrears for three months. On the day Magistrate Liu arrived, the county government had no rice to cook, so the new county magistrate borrowed thirty catties of rice from a friend to solve the first major issue after taking office. The director and doctors of the county's health center all have clinics in the city. The hospital's recurring expenses are 195,000 yuan per month, covering twelve staff members and two workers. After using all the funds for salaries and office expenses, only a little over 10,000 yuan is left for pharmaceutical expenses. The hospital currently has two small bottles of red mercury and four hundred quinine pills. When ordinary people get sick and go to the health center, the doctor says, "There's no way, please go to the clinic? There's medicine there."

The newly appointed Magistrate of Yongxiu County could not afford to eat at the county government, so he had to eat at restaurants outside.

### Schools and Factories, Full of Holes

Jiujiang, with a population of over 150,000, has only one private school. Jiujiang Girls' High School has nearly a hundred students, but no toilets. The young ladies sometimes have a very urgent need.

The poverty of Jiangxi's local finances and the suffering of the people can be seen from these iron facts.

What about economic construction?

In Taihe, the wartime provincial capital, we could see the products of many provincial factories. Although these items could not be supplied on the market on a regular basis, the display of samples could also show a prototype of Jiangxi's economic construction.

During the eight years of the war, the provincial government and various agencies "moved" several times, and provincial factories and private handicrafts can be said to have gone bankrupt. Before the war, there were more than 160 factories in Ji'an, Tai'an, Ganzhou and other places, but two-thirds have now suspended operations or moved, and one-third are struggling with countless holes. The old, well-equipped Jiujiang Jiuxing Yarn Factory's chimney is still "sleeping" there. The Jingdezhen porcelain industry, famous for its porcelain production, has also fallen sharply. Before the war, there were more than 160 porcelain kilns, but now there are only a little over 50 left. Most of them were destroyed by enemy planes. Because the cost is too high and labor disputes arise from time to time, they cannot resume work.

### Construction Work Awaits on All Fronts

Director Ming Jiashao of the Department recently reported on Jiangxi's construction work at a press conference:

(1) Before the war, there were 6,384 kilometers of highways. After the war, only 1,337 kilometers remained. The current restoration progress is divided into three phases. In the first phase, 565 kilometers were completed by the end of last year. The second phase was completed by the end of July, with 669 kilometers. The third phase of the project is currently requesting funds from the central government, and it is difficult to predict when construction will begin. The most difficult thing in the recovery of Jiangxi's highways is the shortage of vehicles. Of the 100 vehicles originally requisitioned by the central government for military transport, only about 20 dilapidated vehicles suitable for minor use were returned. The receiving vehicles allocated by the command headquarters were just a pile of scrap iron in the factory. However, we see Japanese-style small cars and large trucks constantly carrying passengers and goods on the streets and highways. Currently, the Highway Bureau only has 50 "half-paralyzed" broken cars crawling on the 2,571 kilometers of highways.

(2) Regarding the restoration of railroads, the Jiangxi section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway will definitely not be repaired this year. The central government has now agreed to start with the Nanxun Railway, and surveying and roadbed repair are underway.

(3) The construction of farmland water conservancy focuses on flood control and drought prevention. The province has 385 kilometers of embankments, affecting 4.33 million mu of fields. The eight years of war have caused some to deteriorate over time, and some to be destroyed by the enemy. Before the spring flood, the Lifu Embankments in the two counties of Henan (Chang) Xin (Jian) Yong (Xiu) were allocated 10 million yuan in special funds by the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to mobilize laborers for construction. This year, the highest water level of several resolved floods was only a few inches from the top of the embankment. The current bumper harvest and avoidance of water damage is a "post-war" achievement written by the Gan Branch. The dangerous sections and breaches of embankments in other rivers and lakes are also being repaired by the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration in conjunction with the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission and the Jiangxi Water Conservancy Bureau, using work relief methods. Gan Jian also plans to complete 50,000 reservoirs in the shortest possible time, including the KVA engineering project.

The people of Jiangxi, struggling in the banditry and war disasters of the past sixteen years, have still not escaped the threat of hunger. They are extending a hand for help, appealing to society to relieve their lives and improve local politics.

Social Services

### Answering Readers' Legal Questions

(1) Chen Yisun asks: Mr. A borrowed 1,000 yuan of legal tender from Mr. B in the 25th year of the Republic (1936), with a contract stating that 120 yuan of interest would be paid annually, and the property deed was used as collateral. Now, Mr. A wants to repay the loan (1,000 yuan of legal tender) and retrieve the property deed, but Mr. B insists that the currency value has depreciated and refuses to redeem it at the original amount, claiming that it must be calculated according to the rice price ratio. In this case, the repayment will be dozens of times the principal, which Mr. A finds too large to bear. Mediation has been ineffective, and he will resort to the law. Now there are several questions, requesting answers: (1) In law, for a loan from the 25th year of the Republic, should the repayment today be calculated with an increase? Is there any explicit regulation? (2) Does the law recognize the depreciation of legal tender? What is the statutory depreciation rate? (3) Do currency depreciation measures in various countries' fiscal policies have any impact on the repayment of debts? (4) Does the Supreme Court have any precedents for similar disputes? What are the circumstances of the judgment?

[Answer from Lawyer Cao Yaxia] (1) There is no explicit regulation, but according to Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations on Handling Civil Litigation after the Restoration, the court may be requested to make a fair judgment to increase or decrease the payment, or change other original effects. (2) There is no "statutory depreciation rate." (3) Its impact should be beneficial to debtors in money lending. (4) I have not seen any precedents from the Supreme Court on similar disputes, but the local court in this city recently made a judgment on a matter of increasing payment, the main text of which is "The defendant should increase the plaintiff's long-term savings of 1,000 yuan of legal tender and its interest by a thousand times."

(2) Shi Abao asks: I am a 35-year-old woman who was adopted by a relative with the surname Shi when I was young. In the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), I married through a matchmaker. The Shi family only has two parents, no children. A direct nephew inherits. The father died during the Incident, and now there is only one mother left, who has inherited land. I have several questions, please answer in your column: (1) Do I have property rights to the Shi family's land? (2) If I have property rights, can I divide it now? (3) Must I wait until the mother passes away to analyze?

[Answer from Lawyer Cao Yaxia] (1) You and the mother each have one-half of the inherited property. However, if the adopted father's direct nephew was adopted before May 5, 1931, or had a legal adoption relationship with the adoptive parents during the adoptive father's lifetime, then you, the direct nephew, and the adoptive mother each have one-third of the inherited property. (2) Yes. (3) Not necessary.

Weekly Pictorial

### Great Shanghai!

— Ping Zhai

"White clouds and grey dogs, the blue sea and mulberry fields." Who would have thought that a desolate place with only fishing lights in Jiangcun more than a hundred years ago would become the most prosperous Shanghai in China today!

Shanghai "This metropolis with 4.5 million people! Whether you talk about business, diplomacy, politics, or culture, you can't forget Shanghai. Shanghai is the most progressive place in the country, and also the ugliest place in the country, the most comfortable place, and also the dirtiest place. In Shanghai, there are strong contrasts everywhere: extreme luxury and cries of hunger are often separated by only a wall; beautiful clothes and sordid souls are often inseparable.

How many young people in the interior are dreaming beautiful "Shanghai dreams"! They come, and many people make rapid progress, building a world with their bare hands and achieving a career that shocks the country—but in this ruthless struggle of 4.5 million people, there are also those who fall: taking poison, jumping off buildings, jumping into the river... In Shanghai, this is nothing remarkable news.

The eight years of war did not cause too much damage to Shanghai. The Longhua Pagoda is still beautiful, and the skyscrapers still stand tall. However, Hongkou has been washed clean with the blood of soldiers!

Brothers and sisters traveling far from home, please see, the walls of Shanghai no longer have "Jintan" advertisements!

### The Study of Shen Fu

— Jiang Xingyu

Mr. Zong Baihua once explored the beauty of the Jin people from "A New Account of Tales of the World," and I looked at the art of life of the Qing Dynasty scholar-official class from "Six Records of a Floating Life."

The Ming Dynasty was a representative work of Chinese autocratic politics. Ministers had no power, and chambers had no freedom. The encounters of the scholar-official class, who served as helpers, were naturally even more miserable. Under this objective environment, they could only write some romantic and sentimental works, such as the "Tao An Meng Yi." The Aisin Gioro family replaced the Ming, and the degree of autocracy increased. At the same time, due to ethnic prejudices, the writing freedom of the scholar-official class was more severely controlled. Large-scale literary inquisitions were repeatedly launched. The scholar-officials then placed all their spiritual sustenance on love and natural scenery. All writing was filled with a strong aestheticism. Shen Fu, the author of "Six Records of a Floating Life," was a native of Suzhou, which is also one of the factors that contributed to the success of "Six Records of a Floating Life" in the realm of aesthetic literature. Suzhou is the old capital of the Wu Kingdom, a gathering place of Jiangnan culture. For thousands of years, it has been accustomed to a so-called "self-appreciation of romance" art of living. Tasting tea, planting flowers and plants, raising fish and birds, and creating some gadgets formed the entire life of the Suzhou scholar-official class. This kind of life experience and life content is also the perfect material for only aesthetic literature.

Shen Fu was born into a so-called scholarly family, and from childhood, he was accustomed to experiencing fun from spiritual life: "I remember when I was a child, I could stare at the sun and see clearly the smallest details, and I would carefully observe the textures of tiny objects, so I often had fun outside of things. Summer mosquitoes turned into thunder, and I secretly imagined them as cranes flying in the sky. Where my heart was directed, hundreds or thousands of cranes would appear." If a person pursues spiritual life in the leisure time of a fulfilling material life, that kind of spiritual life is mostly built on a material foundation, and strictly speaking, it has already changed its quality. And to adjust the spiritual life of a poor material life is close to people who cannot afford meat eating vegetarian food, and it is difficult to say what elegance and nobility there is.

Focusing too much on the fun of life, to the point of mistakenly believing that the entire life is enjoyment, fun is not inherently undesirable. Newton saw an apple fall and invented gravity, and Watt saw the lid of a kettle open automatically and invented the steam engine, which was nothing more than the attraction of fun. But the fun of the Chinese scholar-official class is often absolutely non-utilitarian. Entertaining oneself is the most important thing, and they are never willing to observe everything from a scientific point of view, because that is a troublesome and laborious game. As for "also keeping mosquitoes in a plain tent, slowly spraying them with smoke, so that they flew and鸣led in the smoke, making a view of green clouds and white cranes, just like cranes鳴叫ing in the clouds, and I was happy. At the uneven places on the earthen wall, where flower terraces and small grasses are mixed, I often crouch down to make myself level with the terrace; concentrate and observe carefully, using the weeds as forests, and the insects and ants as beasts. The protrusions of the soil and gravel are hills, and the depressions are valleys, and I travel in them, and I am content." These things only gave Shen Fu the feeling of "joyful satisfaction" and "contentment," but in today's two centuries later, the scenery of the most magical Hollywood movies is also produced using this principle.

The life of Shen Fu and Chen Yun before and after marriage is a beautiful lyrical poem. Although the two were unable to grow old together, their lives and their happiness were enough to make readers in later generations unable to suppress their envy and intoxication. In a patriarchal society, this kind of marriage is extremely rare. The reason why they were so happy was not accidental. Their marriage had actually gone through the stage of free love first, and was not determined by the one-sided words of parents and matchmakers.

A young person inevitably has dreamlike aspirations for his own marriage, like a white sail of happiness blowing towards him, like a dazzling wonder on the other shore. When we come into contact with it, we cannot actually grasp this novel emotion, or calmly distinguish the flavor of this joy. Shen Fu and Chen Yun have very close personalities, there is only harmony between each other, only lingering love, and each other can fully appreciate the beauty of the other. Shen Fu's descriptive technique is refined: "On the evening of the wedding on the 22nd day of the first month of the Gengzi year of Qianlong, seeing that her thin and timid figure was still the same as before, when the headscarf was removed, they looked at each other and smiled. After joining the cups, we dined side by side at night. I secretly held her wrist under the table, warm and smooth, and my heart couldn't help but beat." This is a very vivid description of young children's love.

Separation is originally something that makes people feel unbearable sadness, not to mention the separation of newlyweds. Shen Fu's description of the pain of separation and the joy of reunion is quite vivid: "Whenever the wind blows through the bamboo courtyard, and the moon rises on the banana window, facing the scenery and thinking of people, my dreams are inverted. The teacher knew his feelings, so he wrote to my father, giving ten topics and leaving me to return temporarily. My joy was the same as that of a soldier who had been pardoned. After boarding the boat, I felt that every moment was like a year. When I arrived home, after saying hello to my mother, I entered the room. Yun got up to greet me. After shaking hands, without saying a word, the souls of the two people were dazed and turned into smoke. I felt a clear sound in my ears, and I didn't know I had this body."

Shen Fu never succeeded throughout his life, that is to say, he was always in adversity, but he was not a figure in the fame and fortune field. Although he was in adversity, he was still at ease. The so-called "adversity records sorrow" is actually a record of the pain of living in a feudal family - the pain of being caught in the gap between love and filial piety.

It was not easy to be a daughter-in-law in a feudal family, especially a woman like Chen Yun who had some literary cultivation and a relatively strong self-esteem. According to common sense, it was easy to have opinions with her mother-in-law. However, Chen Yun also grew up in a feudal family, and what she saw and heard had already made her stereotyped into a person who was willing to be bound by the old etiquette. Fearing that her mother-in-law would say she was lazy, she got up at dawn, and no matter what happened, she endured it and never defended herself against unjust accusations. Even so, the family was not harmonious. Because of some trivial matters, Shen Fu and Chen Yun, this couple, were driven out of the feudal family by the feudal father. Two years later, they finally got permission to return to the big family, but soon they left again because of some trivial matters.

Regarding the pain Chen Yun felt, we can easily imagine it from Shen Fu's saying: "I am mediating in a neutral position, and I am no longer in the realm of the living." It was not good for the two of them to live outside, but Shen Fu's occupation often had problems, and life was extremely poor. To his parents, Shen Fu was a filial son; to his 　子, Shen Fu was a considerate husband. However, the old etiquette demon was at work, trying to put him in the "realm of the non-living" to be tormented. How can we not give him unlimited sympathy.

From another perspective, I think Chen Yun's death may be more complicated than the reasons presented in "Six Records of a Floating Life." Why would Chen Yun think of finding a concubine for her husband? This is a mystery. In my speculation, the degree of Shen Fu's love for one person is not without doubt: Shen Fu was middle-aged when Chen Yun died, and as a result, he took a concubine after the death of his son Fengsen. Of course, he could use the reason that "there are three unfilial acts, and having no offspring is the greatest" as an excuse. A person who is truly dedicated to love would never be willing to do this. As for "Zhuotang opened it, and also sighed for it, and gave me a concubine, re-entering the spring dream," he pushed the responsibility of taking a concubine on his friends, just like the "Petition to the Emperor" used "my uncle robbed my mother's will," using the magic of words to cover up the truth of the facts.

Shen Fu's thoughts, even in that era, cannot be considered progressive. The writing of the painting was after Chen Yun's death, so the book is full of hindsight:

"When I was thirteen years old, I returned to Ning with my mother. The two were young and had no 　. I got to see what she had written. Although I admired her talent and cleverness, I secretly feared that her blessings would not be deep."

"Only the two teeth are slightly exposed, which seems to be a bad appearance."

"I asked to see her poetry manuscript, and there were only one couplet, or three or four sentences, mostly unfinished. I asked her why, and she smiled and said: 'It is the work of no teacher; I hope to meet someone who knows the teacher and can knock it into shape.' I jokingly inscribed her 　 with the words: 'Brocade Xiang Jia Ming'. I don't know that the opportunity for premature death was already buried here."

Writing about his life in the brothel is as boring as "Nine-Tailed Turtle," and he failed to avoid vulgarity:

"I only liked Er alone. Occasionally, I would go alone, or have a small drink on the platform, or have a pleasant conversation in the dormitory. I would not let her sing, nor would I force her to drink more. She was warm and considerate, and I was happy in a boat. The neighboring prostitutes all envied her. Those who were free and had no customers knew I was in the dormitory and would definitely come to visit. None of the prostitutes in the gang did not know me. Every time I got on their boat, they called my name endlessly. I also looked left and right and could not handle it all. This is something that even spending ten thousand taels of gold could not achieve.... "

"Roaming Notes 快" is the weakest of the four notes. Shen Fu's ability to write scenery seems to be slightly inferior to Zhang Dai and Yuan Xiaoxiu. He puts the focus of the book on love, and this part may be sincerely unintentional to deliberately manage. Some places are inaccurate in their narrative, so I have to mention it here incidentally: for example, the distance between Hangu Pass and 　 Pass is definitely not just "about ten li." I don't know what shortcut he took at that time?

General versions of the Six Records only have four records, and the remaining two records are missing. I have also seen versions with all six records, but I also lack reference materials, so I cannot do the work of verifying authenticity. "Zhongshan Ji Li" is a running account, written even more mechanically than "Roaming Notes 快." It is not worth browsing once. "Yang Shen Ji Dao," however, seems to be inconsistent with the spirit of other parts of the book.

What kind of evaluation should we give? From an artistic point of view, the writing skills are certainly not bad; the content is nothing remarkable. Although it allows us to see the art of life of the scholar-official class, this art of life is exactly what the Qing government welcomed. This art of life intentionally or unintentionally made the Qing Dynasty's rule more stable. If the scholar-official class were all like Shen Fu, throwing everything behind them and drilling into the dead end of aestheticism, then the revolution would never happen, and it would still be the "prosperous age" of the Xuantung period of the Great Qing Empire!

Having said that, in today's era when books like "Spy Lady" and "New Road" are selling well, in a comparative sense, "Six Records of a Floating Life" is still a clean book. Shen Fu, this talented man of the Qing Dynasty, is still an honest man. The gimmicks that attract readers and the vulgarity of the style are far inferior to the talented men of modern times. I don't know if this is the progress of the times? Or the decline of the times?

### Mountain · Water · Mist · Human World

— Wang Ji

I was a child who grew up on the plains, and had never been to the mountains, like never having seen the vastness of the world. When I was still a child, my mother often pointed to one or two elevated mounds not far from the house and said, "These are mountains. Beyond the mountains lies the sea. At sea, fog often spreads out like nets, causing fishermen to lose their way and fall into the tide." I had already encountered the concept of mountains in kindergarten picture books: curved shapes with flowers, grass, and singing birds. In comparison, my mother's words seemed correct. But when I read about the difficulties of surpassing the Himalayas, I was completely stunned. The height of the mountains was even more vast and expansive than the world I imagined!

As for the sea and the mist, my mother's explanations and my associations did not connect. I had only seen the gently flowing canal, the peaceful Lake Youzi, whose waters and the ripples in a child's heart could not stir up great waves. And the white mist? I said it was like the cloud-flowers on top of my head. In the autumn, what beautiful cloud-flowers filled the blue sky!

As for the human world, I will forever be a passerby. More so than the mountains, the sea, or the white mist, it seems to have nothing to do with me. Every time my father came back from Shanghai, he would talk endlessly; I only liked the little train and building blocks he bought me... My family had a "long-term" worker, two or three maids, and my books told me that the land would nurture grains; but I was restricted from "contacting the servants," and I had no opportunity to get close to the earth. When I asked my mother, she always squinted her eyes lovingly: "Little girl, you will understand when you grow up."

In my small circle, that's how I slowly grew up.

However, to pursue my education, at the age of thirteen, I left the warm greenhouse and moved to a riverside county town ninety miles away.

From then on, I came to know the ocean.

The school was located at the east gate by the water. We could freely run to greet the rose-colored sunrise in the white mist and watch the sunset sink into the sea. Morning and dusk, taking pictures and sketching, the hearts of the children were like seagulls skimming the water. Walking from the narrow stone steps to the drifting sails buried in the sea sand, listening to the "old hands" tell of overseas adventures, lying on the sea sand watching the waves rise and fall was our "invention." We were amazed by the sea's perpetual restlessness; we never imagined that the waves would later symbolize our fate. -- At that time, we only felt that the ocean was too vast, and the sails beyond the waterline were the dream world of a child!

But with the sound of gunfire, I left that sea, that mountain, that white mist, and that boundless meditation of a child like the white mist! From then on, I was locked up in a "civilized" city, breathing in coal gas, unable to see the mountains, no, not even the lowest mound. -- The sea, only the forever noisy Huangpu River, the Suzhou Creek, forever covered with oil. ...

One spring, I broke free from this "narrow cage" and stepped into the land of mountains from a ship from the East China Sea.

I truly saw the mountains.

I spent a pleasant summer at the foot of Mount Tianmu, in a place that seemed eternally shady, and also spent a snowy winter on the summit of the Yandang Mountains, thousands of feet above sea level. Sitting by a roaring fire, listening to the "children of the mountains" chat about their daily lives, there was also endless interest. But life cannot sweep away the accumulation of time. Three years of bustling about wore through the soles of my shoes and crushed my heart. The skin on my feet gradually thickened, but my feelings for the mountains gradually faded. The mountains shortened my vision, the mountains isolated my hearing, and my circle became even more cramped.

I have left my footprints on countless mountain ranges, and I have tasted the bitterness of countless human worlds. The mountains are not just flowers and grass, trees and singing birds, or some historical sites; the world is not just the little train and building blocks I played with a few years ago... I was shaken awake from my childhood dreams, and I saw things beyond the flowers, grass, and building blocks.

It is said that fog grows on the sea, but my years of living by the sea did not make me understand the loathing of fog. Living in the mountains, I fully experienced the oppression of the fog and deeply understood my mother's interpretation of the sea back then. Fog should not be praised, like pollen trying to cover up a woman's anemia. Now, I curse the mountains, and I curse even more the mountains, the water, and the white mist that grow on them...

The victory bells of August have now awakened the hearts of a gradually sleeping nation. The fog should be removed from the mountains, from the sea, and from the rivers of people's hearts, forever removed. The wanderer can see the mountains and waters he loved as a child. I want to see if the mound my mother pointed to still grows flowers and grass? Does the tide still sing the same song as before? I want to recall my simple emotions! My father has been dead for many years, and the little train and building blocks must have turned into rotten iron and wood, right? Regarding the human world, I will gain some insight. I want to take a breath of slightly salty air on the distant coast, I want to see the rose-colored sun always triumph over the fog.

1945 · August · In the mountains of Longquan.

### An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of River, an Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

At this time, he spoke in fluent Beijing dialect.

"Do you know why these bastards opened fire again?... It's because the troops from the mainland and outside the customs have arrived, almost a hundred thousand people. A few dozen artillery shots, so that the newly arrived troops can hear, and it will also show that they are not idle here, and are "working hard, killing enemies and achieving results."... I said, Big Brother, let's do things openly. That letter..." He pointed to the letter pressed under my hand, "Oh, just now he suddenly said he wanted to study it, study our relationship..."?

"That's right." I straightened the stack of letters again.

"Okay..." A look of determination immediately appeared on his face, "Anyway, you have to understand my affairs one by one, thoroughly, otherwise there may be problems in the future..."! He shook his head and glanced at the letter in front of me, "Do you know about the Wanbaoshan incident...? Immediately followed by the occupation of Shenyang. At that time, I had just graduated from the Army Academy and was assigned to the General Staff Headquarters of the Expeditionary Force as an intern... The following spring, I met her..."

At that time, his actual age was exactly twenty years old, and no officer above the rank of second lieutenant was younger than him. But he was gifted, intelligent, and precocious; calm and composed in the face of events; willing to work, and willing to work hard. Therefore, he was quite favored by his superiors, who transferred him to the Telecommunications Department, where he was the person in charge of a small section.

At that time, the so-called General Staff Headquarters, to put it bluntly, was a unified spy headquarters, doing purely intelligence work, and plotting to invade China. Although its status was said to be several times higher than the General Staff Headquarters in the country, in reality the headquarters and the general headquarters were one and two, two and one, only lacking a minister.

Moreover, the group of people in the headquarters, because of seizing Shenyang, believed that their功劳功勞 was unparalleled, and unconsciously became complacent, of course, they had to reveal the ferocious face of the conqueror in practice. The first step, needless to say, was to quickly implement the four major national policies of rape, plunder, arson, and murder. In addition, the poison policy followed closely; opium poisoning, gambling poisoning, sexual poisoning, cultural poisoning. These types of poisons all had specialized agencies to manage. In addition, they had to use ronin, traitors, bandits, and White Russians to implement the great cleansing policy; to eliminate resistance elements. The biggest task of the cleansing was extortion.

As a result, most of the pure and good people had no choice but to enter the customs as soon as possible. But this was not easy to do; even if they walked two more steps, they needed a movement certificate and a travel certificate, let alone entering the customs? Perhaps they believed that if the local people wanted to enter the customs, it was practically the same as a house slave preparing to escape, and permission would be denied one hundred percent of the time.

"This day," Tsurumi continued, "I had a small matter and went to the police bureau, and saw several ronin surrounding a fifteen- or sixteen-year-old girl, teasing and making fun of her. You know my temper, I don't like people being bullied, especially the weak. At the same time, I didn't want to get involved with those bastards, so I used a "Five Thunder Technique" - I waved to the girl and greeted her in Japanese.

"The girl, of course, didn't understand. She thought I was a high-ranking officer, and that I was calling her inside to ask questions, so she ran towards me. The ronin, they knew my status, and when they heard me greet the girl, saying, "What do you want? Why are you talking to me?" they thought I was a friend of the girl's family. Instantly, they looked like demons and monsters, as if they had been hit by a palm thunder, and they couldn't even escape in time..." He laughed as he said this.

The girl was called Ji Yaoyun. Her father worked as a clerk in a regiment headquarters under Zhang Xueliang, and also ran a shop. After the September 18th Incident, the Northeast changed into a different situation. Her father could no longer be an official, and the shop could no longer be maintained, so he could only sit at home and worry all day. She herself, of course, no longer went to school.

### Public Trial of the Wen Case

— Shao Fu

The results of the public trial of the Wen Yiduo case in Kunming. According to the confessions of the murderers Tang Shiliang and Li Wenshan, they committed the murder because Wen Yiduo, at the memorial service for Li Gongpu, insulted and scolded the government and condemned the military, forcing them to act out of temporary anger.

I remember that since the Li-Wen case occurred, some newspapers and magazines have been very busy, besides calling them "Democratic" martyrs, they also vowed to avenge this "irreconcilable" feud. From Li Gongpu's death, the name Jiaochangkou was brought up. Anyone who has been to Chongqing last year will remember that several people fought for the chairmanship at a meeting in Jiaochangkou (Li Gongpu also fought on the spot) was shamelessly exaggerated by some people into a "bloody case".

From the confessions of the murderers, we see that the reason for the murder was a momentary "indignation," and the "indignation" came from the deceased "condemning the military," not as some parties described in vivid detail, saying that it had so much substance. They had already known all the details before the case was solved.

Regarding the murder charge, we will not talk about the fair judgment of the law.

In fact, is it "democracy" to insult and scold the government and condemn the military? (Is it "democracy" to fight for the chairmanship?) I don't know how some people will justify themselves in the future.

Dancing Girl Manager

### Brokers of the Pornographic Market

— Moxie

Night Shanghai is full of gilded dens, and dance halls are one of them. Despite the dazzling walls, sparkling with five-colored lights, and the melodious string music accompanying the graceful dance steps, those with discerning eyes can see that this is just a blend of tears and blood. How can the superficial joy of the dancers hide the bitterness and melancholy in their hearts!

In my opinion, this is a tragic and sad scene. Many young people, for the sake of a moment of joy in the dance hall, end up wasting their time and ruining their reputation. Many harmonious and loving families are broken up and destroyed halfway because of the intrusion of a small dancing girl.

Between the dancers and the customers, acting as intermediaries, are the so-called "dance hall managers". The "dance hall manager" has a name, called the dance girl administrator, and they have existed since the dance halls existed. Normally, each dance hall originally had only one or two managers, who truly fulfilled their management responsibilities, and the dancers all behaved themselves and had fixed seats. Gradually, the work of the managers changed its nature, and they began to solicit business, which is called "grabbing a seat". When a customer has just sat down, these managers will come and go diligently to ask: "Sir, do you have any regulars?" Regulars are "familiar dancing girls". Or he would say in a pleading tone: "Sir, can I introduce one to you, okay?" And so on, they would even use a begging tone: "Sir, please help, can you call one?"

Yes, they are for life, and also for the life of the dancers! When the customer is a little familiar, and the beautiful appearance is swaying in front of his eyes, and the plump body is jumping in his heart, the manager will whisper in his ear with a touch of interest: "Leave it to me, one word." So money and chastity changed positions, the violator gets a moment of empty joy, and the violated gets rice to be cooked urgently. In any case, the middleman is fattened! But you can believe it by looking at the managers who are increasing day by day. At present, there are usually more than ten managers in each dance hall, and the most have reached as many as twenty-six. Some only have two dancers under their command, and they can live comfortably.

They live by the red dancers, and the method is that the dancers of the so-called "hand file wave" give ten or hundreds of thousands of yuan every month. Some also talk about "deductions". The usual method of splitting the revenue between the dancer and the dance hall is that after deducting the entertainment tax, everyone splits it evenly. From the 50% that the dancer gets, she will take out 5% and give it to the manager.

Their demands do not stop there. Another method is "hitting the autumn wind". They often have some relatives who celebrate their yin and yang birthdays, or they sometimes have a soup cake for their children. The dancers' "small gifts" go with the wind. Sometimes, there is a straightforward method: asking to borrow money, and if they can't borrow it, they will follow it with destruction.

They have all kinds of ingenious destructive methods. When a customer specifies that he wants a certain dancer, he will say to you very politely: "She didn't come today." Then, he will say in a seductive tone: "I'll introduce you to an even more beautiful one." The customer nods indifferently, and his plan is successful!

This is not thorough enough, they have come up with a simple method, simply not letting the dancers sit around the dance floor as usual, but imprisoning them in the toilet room, so that unless they go through the hands of the managers, they can only sit dry on one side.

After a long period of threats and enticements, the dancers finally inevitably become their prisoners, and to the extreme, they use these innocent women as a net to defraud money.

However, it must be said that the turbid are turbid, and the clear are clear. Those who defend will say: There are also good people among the dance hall managers. But they are still as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. The only way to get to the root of the problem is to abolish the manager system. Recently, the municipal authorities have repeatedly issued orders, and the police have resolutely checked and implemented them, which is a sign of determination to clean up.

Someone may say with compassion: "There are more than two hundred dance hall managers in the city, and four or five thousand people depend on them for a living. This is still a profession! If they are not allowed to exist, isn't this going to starve them to death?" But I still don't understand, is there no other way to make a living besides this deformed "profession"?

### People

— Yi Qian

A few days ago, I heard people say that the people of Dongtai, under the order of the "democratic government," were each assigned two hand grenades to cooperate in front of the "people's army" and be the vanguard for "opposing the civil war." When these people were escorted to the battlefield, everyone suddenly, unanimously, threw the hand grenades at the New Fourth Army. In that final moment, the people turned their direction and expressed their true attitude to the "democratic government."

### Adapt to Circumstances

— Yi Xing

Tram conductor: How old are you?

Child: Twenty-five years old.

Movie theater ticket taker: How old are you?

Child: Twelve years old.

Father: Why didn't any of the schools you applied to accept you?

Son: There are really too many people, and the number of admissions is limited.

Father: Then why were all the classmates who took the exam with you this time accepted?

Son: That... that's because they asked people to intercede. I can't do that kind of thing.

Father...

Dean: If you don't pay your tuition deposit, the school authorities will expel you.

Student: Didn't the accounting director say that if you are one week overdue, you will be fined double, two weeks will be fined triple, and so on?

Dean: Um... that's also a way.

### I am a Elementary School Teacher

— Ying Ying

I am a teacher in a small elementary school, and it has been almost eight years now. Everyone knows about the meager treatment and hard life of elementary school teachers.

In the early morning, as the faint morning light gradually spreads a fishy white on the window, I habitually open my sleepy, tired eyes. What catches my eye is the pile of homework that I hadn't finished grading last night until twelve o'clock. I want to get up with a tired body, but extremely tired, I can't help but close my eyes again. Then there is a burst of rumbling garbage trucks and the shouts of the night soil carriers, disturbing me again, and I am awakened again. Thinking of the homework that I have to hand out today, I muster up the courage to jump out of bed. After a hasty wash, I count the homework, and there are still dozens of books, so I sit down to grade them regardless of everything. I use my best effort to finish grading these homework books in just a few hours. I look at the clock, there is only a quarter of an hour before class, so I hurriedly eat porridge and go to school. As soon as I arrive at school, a clever elementary school student runs up to me and says, "Good morning, teacher, is the homework graded? Did we do well this time?" I smile and say, "Very good! I will hand out the homework in class." Grading homework is one of the daily tasks of a teacher, and it is also the most tiring and troublesome thing. My entire morning and evening are spent on grading homework in this way.

Next is the class. When teaching, I have to raise my voice to explain, and I also have to make the children interested and fully understand the meaning of the book. For those who are dull-witted, I have to explain it again and again without fear of trouble. It is quite tiring, but seeing their innocent faces, my tired heart becomes excited again. Being with them gives me infinite comfort. They are all pure children, without hypocrisy or pretension. They say whatever they think in their hearts, and if they have an opinion, they tell the teacher regardless of other people's criticisms and secret hatreds. I never get tired of being with them.

In eight years of life, I have never left the children or given up teaching. I once told my friends casually: "Children are my soul, I want to be with them forever!" For them, I have missed several jobs with good salaries. Therefore, many people blame me and say, "There are so many good jobs in the world, why do you have to be a poor teacher?" In such times, I often respond with a smile. I believe that life does not necessarily have to satisfy the material enjoyment of food, clothing, housing, and transportation, but should be at peace with one's heart. Although I have not made much contribution to society, but since I am a member of society, I should do my best and fulfill my responsibility, so that I can have a clear conscience. I will never give up my poor teaching life.

The school in the grasslands of Dakota in the western United States has only one room, but it is the center of cultural activities in the vicinity.

### Shanghai Wife

— Juan Chan

The typical wife of a Shanghai family.

In the afternoon, the husband goes to the office, and the wife is lonely alone, so she might as well make a phone call to invite a few little sisters to make a table of sanitary mahjong.

Mahjong is the life of Shanghai wives, and playing mahjong is almost their entire life. They open the table, spread a white tablecloth, and then take out the wooden box and pour out the tiles. Four people happily "play" together; the sound of the tiles is crackling, and the laughter and the sound of the tiles are "crashing", which constitutes the "family symphony" of the afternoon.

You go into the home of each of your friends, and the husband is not there, it is always like this.

You say they are not knowledgeable! But almost all of them have graduated from normal schools or universities. You don't know that on some festival, they attended some women's association and shouted slogans, posted slogans, and were very interested! Then they marched on the street for some reason, fiercely and powerfully. You secretly call them "heroines of mankind"!

It seems that everything has been said here, so let's go back to the incident of them "playing mahjong":

Mahjong tiles seem to have magic power. After playing them every day, if you don't touch mahjong tiles today, your fingers will feel a little itchy. If you suppress her from playing tiles for three days, she will have "lovesickness"!

She doesn't even recognize the shop signs on the street, but she recognizes all the patterns and words on the tiles; a smart woman can tell just by touching them without looking. Even if she forgets when her youngest son's birthday is, she still remembers very clearly how the cards were played on which round and which banker yesterday, even after three or five days.

If the mahjong is played until late, and she is almost tired, she will call her husband, who has just come home, to help her play a few hands. But fate does not help people. She loses every time, and she will blame her husband: saying that her luck is not good, and that his skills are not good. The complaining and reasoning make the husband dizzy and headache. If the husband has a little more temper, he will scold or fight at this time; if he is more peaceful, he will give all the money for buying a pair of leather shoes tomorrow to his wife, and apologize. Otherwise, the husband will suffer.

It seems that saying this here is going to be criticized for being too verbose, so I will stop here immediately.

### Today's Society

— Huang Guichu

China is known as an ancient civilization of the East. It has a long history of five thousand years, and has a unique culture and inherent morality. However, the current level of culture is low, and people's hearts are becoming more and more wicked. All kinds of hypocrisy, deception, trickery, speculation, and power struggles arise in response to the times and are regarded as customs; a certain principal, as a teacher, knowingly violates the law and rapes female students; a certain university student, claiming to be the backbone of society, is good at jumping and dancing, and throws away his books to become a robber; a certain bank clerk steals gold bricks and tours the West Lake; a certain shop assistant alters checks to buy a fine horse. How ingenious, how delightful! Such things are endless, and moral bankruptcy has reached this point! How can concerned people not be saddened!

Various Aspects

A certain provincial middle school had more than two thousand applicants for the recent freshman entrance examination for senior high school, which cannot be considered few, because that provincial middle school is well-known in Shanghai. However, after the first subject examination, seven or eight hundred people were absent from the second subject. Is this because the questions are difficult, or is the level of students declining day by day?

The Associated Universities (Lian Da) had more than eight thousand applicants in Shanghai for this examination. It was unavoidable to have divided sessions based on scores, but not a few people dropped out halfway. There were many who submitted blank English composition papers. The topic was "Human Body," and the main ideas of the paragraphs were even written out as instructions, but it still ended up like this. Were the questions difficult? Was the level low?

Students often make waves out of nothing. As soon as they see a classmate talking to a female classmate for a few more words, or going out to play together once, they will ask that classmate for candy. The reason is that you have a girlfriend, so you should treat everyone to candy, so that everyone can be sweet and happy. Eventually, you have to give it to them. Recently, the trend of eating friends' candy, except in elementary schools where it is not found because students are young, can be said to be very prevalent in middle schools and above.

### Dare-to-Die Corps

— Zou Shangchang

Rush forward, get shot in the front, fall forward.

Retreat backward, get shot in the back, fall backward.

Under such circumstances, I don't know how many people have died.

When I arrived in Tianjin, a friend happened to come from the Northeast. We hadn't seen each other for many years, and there was endless joy. We almost didn't get to meet. It turned out that my friend was doing business in Andong. After fourteen years of enemy trampling, victory finally came, but still, there were no peaceful days in sight. He disguised himself as a merchant, carried a small bundle, and walked towards Guanli. He claimed to be doing business along the way and finally passed safely.

He had witnessed a battle, lying in ambush in a small ditch for a day and a night, without a drop of water, and escaped with his life.

When he passed through the Communist army's cordon, he saw groups of ordinary people with tables and stools on their heads, covered with wet quilts hanging down on all sides, and countless feet running forward. It turned out that these were innocent Northeastern compatriots being dragged to be the "Dare-to-Die Corps." Putting tables and quilts on their heads was to avoid getting shot in the head... The machine guns rang. The Northeastern people, who had suffered for fourteen years, would die whether they went forward or retreated backward, and finally died at the hands of their own people. This is a living drama. Above are squares, below are two feet, groups and groups of them, hundreds of them. They died, they died, they truly gained freedom and would never be forced to be a "Dare-to-Die Corps" again. They did not die at the hands of the enemy who had controlled them for fourteen years, but died today. Their souls are laughing, how tragic, how gloomy! The national flag of the Blue Sky and White Sun was finally seen again after fourteen years.
