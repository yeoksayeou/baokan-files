###策反投機終難倖免 周逆佛海判處極刑

[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] The treacherous Zhou Fohai, who practiced "two-faced politics" and was "multi-talented" and "chameleon-like," was sentenced to death by the Capital High Court on the morning of the 7th, with lifelong deprivation of civil rights, and all property confiscated except for a discretionary allowance for family living expenses. At 8:00 AM, Zhou and Luo Junqiang were escorted to Chaotian Palace and detained in a suite of the waiting room. At 8:50 AM, Court President Luo Yunxie, along with Judges Ge Zhaosu and Li An, and female Clerk Huang Shu, convened a panel in the Dacheng Hall to investigate Luo's crimes. Zhou was brought in to testify. Five minutes later, under the escort of military police, Zhou walked through the crowd and stood at the interrogation stand. Zhou wore a deep blue cloth robe, a small Qing-era style jacket and trousers, gray woolen socks, and black round-toe leather shoes. He wore glasses with yellow rims, and appeared calm and composed. The court first questioned him about his relationship with Luo and Luo's role in serving in puppet positions. Then, they delved into their collaboration in the counter-insurgency efforts, the poisoning of Li Shiqun, and the provision of military intelligence. At 9:15 AM, Luo was brought back for interrogation. The testimonies of the two criminals were consistent, and their calm and loquacious demeanor, as well as their smiles while boasting of their merits, were also similar. Subsequently, witness Wang Kexiu (also known as Ma Guangzeng) testified about his work as a member of the Literary and Arts Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Party during the occupation, engaging in underground activities and organizing the Founding the Nation Society, and how he managed to obtain intelligence from Luo Kexin, the secretary-general of the Shanghai Municipal Party. Witness Zhang Junsheng testified about his connection with Luo as ordered by the Military Intelligence Bureau. Zhang also confirmed that the handwritten letter from the late Director Dai in the presented evidence was genuine (the letter contained much encouragement, and included the phrase "I will take responsibility for everything here"). After reading the transcript, the court adjourned at 10:30 AM.

At 10:35 AM, Court President Jin Shiding and Judges Wang Hongquan and Shentu Chen convened a panel to reinvestigate Zhou Fohai to testify in the case of Yang Xinghua. Zhou first denied the allegation of reporting Tian Renzuan's embezzlement, stating that he had no memory of such a matter. He then described how Yang assisted him in his work, obtaining and transmitting intelligence about the enemy's invasion strategy in Xiang and Gui. The interrogation concluded at 11:15 AM. Chief Prosecutor Chen Shengzu of the Zhou case joined the original court to begin sentencing.

After everyone in the courtroom stood up, President Jin read the main text of the judgment in a solemn and firm tone: "Zhou Fohai is guilty of conspiring with an enemy country to plot against his own country and is sentenced to death. All property, except for a discretionary allowance for necessary family living expenses, is to be confiscated."

Zhou listened to the verdict with extreme tension, his face yellow but maintaining composure. President Jin continued reading a section of the judgment's reasoning and turned to a consoling tone, saying: "The defendant's circumstances are serious, and his position is important. This court, in accordance with the law and fairness, has imposed the death penalty. However, this is not the final verdict. According to the law, it must be submitted to the Supreme Court for review and decision. If there is absolutely no room for reversal in terms of the law, the central government may consider the merits of the counter-insurgency effort and may, through administrative discretion, commute the sentence by granting special amnesty or reducing the penalty." After finishing, he ordered Zhou to be taken back into custody. It was 11:30 AM. Zhou tightly pursed his lips, widened his eyes, and fiercely walked out of the courtroom, escorted back to the waiting room by court personnel. He and Luo were then taken back to the Tiger Bridge Detention Center in the same car.

High Court President and Prosecutor Believe the Sentence Was Fair

[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] The death sentence of Zhou has been well-received here, with many feeling that the court's enforcement of the law was strict and fair, and that Zhou deserved his punishment. Over five thousand members of the public who were observing the sentencing applauded. They continued to discuss the matter even after Zhou was taken away. They admired the High Court's respect for national law and the maintenance of national integrity, and its spirit of imposing the death penalty on a major traitor after thorough discussion. However, they were concerned that Zhou, with his wide connections and wealth, would vigorously seek to avoid death. Zhao Chen, the President of the Zhou case trial, said after the sentencing: "Zhou was quite talented. If he had followed the national policy of resistance and obeyed the leadership, his political future would have been unlimited. However, due to his lack of firm will, he turned to speculation and was ultimately convicted of treason. It is deeply regrettable from the perspective of cherishing talent, but the court must uphold the law, and Zhou's treasonous acts are undeniable. Therefore, the death penalty was imposed. As for the possibility of reducing the sentence through political rights, it depends on how the authorities weigh the situation. Considering the example of the French court sentencing Laval and Pétain to death, the merits of these two French traitors should not be less than those of Zhou. However, Laval could not escape his fate, while Pétain, due to his distinguished service in the previous World War and his advanced age, was granted a special amnesty and reduced sentence by de Gaulle. Therefore, the authorities must carefully consider public opinion and consult extensively before exercising this political right." Chen Shengzu, the prosecutor in charge of Zhou's case, told our reporter: "There should be no doubt that Zhou should be sentenced to death. The judicial organs only know the law and do not consider other factors. If Zhou's heinous crimes can still be forgiven, it would damage the dignity of the law, and I would have to appeal. I believe that this wise judgment has already become final, and that the highest judicial authorities and the executive branch will value national discipline, national integrity, and the public opinion of the people, and will not allow this opportunistic traitor to escape justice."

### Zhou Fohai Before and After the Sentencing Demanded a Fair Judgment Before the Sentencing Tears Flowed After the Death Sentence

[Special Report] The 7th was the day of the final verdict for the major traitor Zhou Fohai. Jianye Road was packed with people, especially newly opened reporters who were eager to capture the final sentencing scene in the crackdown on traitors. In the past few days, opinions have varied in the capital regarding Zhou Fohai's sentence. "Death penalty," "life imprisonment," "acquittal" - all of these possibilities were being debated. This mystery could only be revealed in the Dacheng Hall.

In the past few days, Zhou's family has been busy, as have the defense lawyers. The traitor suppression authorities recently received a statement from the High Court regarding Zhou's defense. He said: "During the emergency of the Xiang-Gui War, he had secret intelligence, supplied it to the Military Intelligence Bureau, exposed the enemy's troop movements, and launched a large-scale suppression campaign, which was forwarded to the central government by the Military Intelligence Bureau." The Military Intelligence Bureau received this official document and naturally had to respond. However, based on the actual situation at the time, if Zhou Fohai had had intelligence at the time, the retreat from Xiang-Gui would not have been so disastrous. We see that in the interrogation by the Capital High Court, President Zhao and Prosecutor Chen refuted him so thoroughly that he was left without any defense. The number one traitor who sold out the country and colluded with the enemy should of course be subjected to the most severe penalty of the state law, without a doubt.

Yesterday morning, reporters rushed to Tiger Bridge Prison to wait. At around 8 o'clock, the prosecutor led a team of bailiffs and police officers from the Internal Security Corps, more than a dozen in total, driving a Japanese-style truck. The reporters followed them to the Zhongzi Prison. At this time, Zhou Fohai, Luo Junqiang, and Ding Mocun all came together. Luo Junqiang had his hair slicked back, still with the air of a "minister" from the past. Zhou Fohai changed into a blue cloth robe yesterday and also looked elegant. Luo Junqiang was being interrogated again. Ding Mocun stood aside, mentally very uncomfortable. There was no news, and it was unknown whether it was good or bad, which made him very anxious. He even hesitantly asked a bailiff: "How is my news?" The bailiff naturally ignored him. After Zhou Fohai and Luo Junqiang were taken away, Ding said: "Brother Zhou, I hope you bring back good news," his words filled with bitterness.

At 8:30 AM, they were escorted from Tiger Bridge. Zhou Fohai and Luo Junqiang sat next to the driver, talking and laughing. Coincidentally, there was a hole in the glass next to the driver's seat. The reporter, taking advantage of this opportunity, with the permission of the bailiff, began to talk to Zhou:

"I heard that public opinion has not been very favorable to you recently. What are your feelings?"

"Of course, I know my own affairs, but it is a fact that I surrendered and contacted the central government. Chairman Chiang is also clear about this."

"Your contact with the Military Intelligence Bureau is said to be a 'two-faced' approach. What exactly is going on?"

"Cheng Kequn is not dead. You can ask him. Zhou Hao of the Military Intelligence Bureau testified for me in court. Of course, it can't be fake."

"The court announced that your contact with the Military Intelligence Bureau was entirely your means of conspiring with the enemy and leaking our country's secrets. How do you explain this?"

"It's hard to explain, but it's not easy to establish a radio station, and it's not easy to obtain intelligence. That's probably what he's referring to!"

"Will the court sentence you to 'death,' 'life imprisonment,' or 'acquittal' today?"

"That's hard to say."

"What if you are sentenced to death?"

"I am willing to obey the national law, but the scale must be fair."

Chaotian Palace arrived, and our conversation ended in the mixed voices of the crowd.

The Dacheng Hall and the square inside were still crowded, the only difference being that there were no loudspeakers. At 9 o'clock, the presiding judge took the stand and began interrogating Luo Junqiang first. The court questioned and refuted at the same time, and Luo Junqiang was quite frustrated. Zhou Fohai and Luo Junqiang were together, with a joint relationship, and testifying for Luo was no different from defending himself. Lawyer Xue Songqi submitted powerful evidence for Luo, claiming it was the late Director Dai of the Military Intelligence Bureau's own handwriting. The reporter saw that it was written in bold fountain pen. The court read aloud: "Brother Junqiang, Greetings. Long time no see, I miss you very much. I learned from Brother Junsheng that you have been working hard for the country over the years and caring about old friends. I am very impressed and concerned. Now is the best time for those with ambitions to serve the country and be loyal to the leader under the coercion of the enemy for many years. Please contact all parties with ambitions, unite all useful forces that can be controlled, adapt to the times, and coordinate actions. I will take responsibility for everything here. The rest will be presented in person by Comrade Junsheng. I respectfully wish you great health. Your brother, Yushang, July 29." Zhang Junsheng also testified for him today. Luo Junqiang seemed pleased after this passage was read. After one session ended, the second session began. The clerk read the record, and the presiding judge first asked about the matter of Yang Xinghua and other things.

At 11:15, Prosecutor Chen arrived at the court. Presiding Judge Jin Shiding announced in a loud voice, "Sentencing." At this time, there was a commotion among the audience. Zhou Fohai stood motionless at the defendant's stand. The presiding judge immediately announced the main text of the death sentence for Zhou Fohai. Zhou trembled slightly. Judge Jin continued, "Zhou Fohai, this court has sentenced you to death. You can still appeal to the Supreme Court. The highest authorities can commute your sentence, and you may not die." He announced the adjournment, and Zhou left without saying a word, walking out with his head held high. The bailiffs escorted him to the car. The reporter finally had another conversation with Zhou just before leaving Chaotian Palace. The reporter asked him:

"What do you feel about being sentenced to death?"

"This is the national law, but the scale is a bit too tilted. Is my merit not needed?"

"Are you still appealing?"

"Yes."

"Did you hear the presiding judge's last words?"

"I heard them, sir. Zhou Fohai's fate was not decided today. It was already sealed the day the late Director Dai died. Only the late Director Dai knew my actions best. If he were here, he could have cleared my name. Now that he is dead, what is there? If I die, I will miss General Dai even more, China's outstanding intelligence talent. The presiding judge's words may have been to comfort me." At this point, Zhou shed tears, one by one.

The bailiffs urged the driver to start the car. At the reporter's request, Zhou Fohai left the words "The truth will be known ten years later" on the reporter's notepad. Zhou Fohai will inevitably become the successor of Lin Baisheng and Mei Siping at Tiger Bridge!

Chairman Chiang agreed to his eight proposals. After one procedure was completed, the mediator, in view of the fact that the previous suggestions made in an estimated manner were rejected by the Communist Party, first sought the opinion of the Communist Party this time. Zhou Enlai then proposed nine proposals (five political and four military). This compromise suggestion was immediately made based on the opinions of both sides. Liang said that he believes the prospect of peace will still go through a dragging stage.

### Peace Talks Gradually Dimming The Government Awaits a Concrete Statement from the CCP A Response to the Mediators' Proposals May Be Submitted Today

[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] The peace talks have made no progress as of today. According to a representative of the government, the government hopes that negotiations will be realized as soon as possible, but negotiations without end will not produce results. In other words, there must be a basis for negotiation, but the CCP has not yet made a genuine statement. It is feared that there will be no progress in the current situation.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 7th] According to a government source, government representatives consulted with Chairman Chiang on the evening of the 7th and decided not to resume negotiations until the Communist Party formally responds to the eight proposals made by Chairman Chiang. As of now, the Communist Party has not responded. When Wu Tiecheng and Shao Lizi met with Zhou Enlai in Shanghai, Zhou had already stated the Communist Party's position. A Communist Party spokesman said: This action is unnecessary because the Communist Party's position has undoubtedly been conveyed to Chairman Chiang. At the same time, the CCP will consider whether to submit a formal response to the eight proposals, which will be forwarded to Chairman Chiang by Special Envoy Marshall. Tonight's developments seem to make the complex political situation even darker, and it seems impossible to resume negotiations before the National Assembly convenes. Envoy Marshall and Minister Stuart met with Chairman Chiang before the government representatives met with Chairman Chiang, and then discussed with Zhou Enlai, Luo Longji, Zhang Junli, and other mediators.

[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] Government representative Sun Ke returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 7th. All government representatives met at Sun's residence at 9:00 AM to discuss the proposals made by the mediators. After careful study, they went to dinner at the Chairman's invitation at 7:30 PM and reported everything on the spot, and did not leave until about 10:00 PM. Subsequently, the government representatives gathered again to discuss, and did not return to their residences until 11:45 PM. When the reporter waited for Lei Zhen and asked about the Chairman's instructions, he said that there was no response to the previous proposals today, and the government will consider it again or respond on the afternoon of the 8th. It is understood that the focus of the current problem is not on the form of negotiation, but on the content of the negotiation. Therefore, the Chairman's call and the government representatives' meeting on the 7th were all to study the content in detail.

[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] The Youth Party, the Democratic League, and representatives from various social circles will continue to meet at the Bank of Communications at 10:00 AM on the 9th. Luo Longji, Zhang Junmai, and Ying Ketu will host a banquet at noon. There will be no major activities in the afternoon. Zhang Shenfu and others visited Zhou Enlai in the evening but did not meet him. The rest went to the Soviet ambassador's cocktail party. They all seemed to be waiting for the government's response. They will gather as usual on the 8th. Special Envoy Marshall visited Stuart in the morning and talked for two hours.

More than 40,000 people are urgently awaiting transport by sea from Dalian to Yantai, in order to reinforce eastern Liaoning. According to a visitor who just came from the Northeast: The 52nd Army of the National Army is very cautious about entering Andong. They also strictly ordered the troops approaching the Sino-Korean border not to retaliate even if any external forces obstruct them. In addition, the communist troops on the south bank of the Songhua River still occasionally shell the National Army positions on the north bank and prevent bridge construction. It is also rumored that the communist troops in Harbin currently have 40,000 armed and equipped men, and important institutions in the city have been completely moved to Jiamusi.

[Our Shenyang Office, 6th] This reporter took advantage of Du Yuming's inspection of Andong to make a two-day tour of Andong. The best impression was the local security. The province and city are both actively promoting their work, and the people are eager for governance. On the Sinuiju side, gunshots are occasionally heard at night.

### Shanxi Communist Army Distributes Opium as Pay to Soldiers

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 6th] Since the communist army is about to harvest new opium, in order to actively promote the sale of old opium stocks, it has specially distributed large quantities of opium to the troops in various military sub-districts and the Guanzhong area, pricing each package at 12,000 yuan, which can be used to offset the soldiers' salaries, and instructed the receiving troops and agencies to transport and sell them to the areas recovered by the National Army as much as possible in exchange for supplies. According to sources: more than 200 catties of opium have been transported to the Guanzhong area. The military and political authorities are strictly preventing it.

Grain Prices Still Soar After Harvest: Robberies Occur Frequently Under Hunger and Cold

[Our Changchun Office, 6th] Mayor Zhao Junmai told reporters that he was unable to suppress the rising grain prices. After the harvest in the Northeast, life is still threatened by soaring grain prices. The Northeast, which can be called the granary, has indeed fallen into a state of hunger.

[Another Dispatch] Several robbery cases occurred continuously last week, and the citizens were shocked. The police station solved the cases quickly. These thefts were committed by vagrants and vagabonds, not organized bandits. They were indeed hungry thieves under the pressure of life.

### Korean Delegation Receives Reporters: Denies Rumors of Anti-Chinese Sentiment in South Korea, Emphasizes the Importance of Sino-Korean Friendship

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] The Korean Delegation to China received the Chinese press at 3 pm on the 7th, hosted by Min Seokrin. A statement was issued regarding the "Anti-Chinese Incident in Korea", stating: The news in the newspapers on the 4th that an anti-Chinese incident occurred in Korea is completely inconsistent with the facts. It further stated: After the establishment of the US military government in South Korea, in view of the fact that a few people took violent actions against overseas Chinese when the first batch of Korean expatriates were repatriated from China, in retaliation for their experiences in China, fearing that this would cause widespread resentment, various measures were taken when the second batch of repatriation ships entered the port to strictly prohibit anti-Chinese or retaliatory acts, and solemnly declared that serious punishments would be imposed if such incidents occurred. Therefore, no anti-Chinese or retaliatory acts have occurred among Koreans returning to Korea from China. After our Provisional Government returned to Korea, in view of the importance of Sino-Korean national friendship, Zhao Suang, Shin Yi-hee, and domestic celebrities such as Ahn Jae-hong organized the Sino-Korean Friendship Association to engage in friendship work. When the overseas Chinese left Korea and returned to China this time, the Korean National Defense Guard gave them special treatment and provided all conveniences. The Korean representative also made a sincere speech, stating that the overseas Chinese returned to China this time voluntarily, and hoped that they would still live in Korea soon, and asked everyone to forgive and help the Korean expatriates in China. Before the ship sailed, the Koreans shouted "Long live the Republic of China!" "Long live Chairman Chiang!" to boost their morale. All of the above are accurate facts.

### Various Railways Actively Repaired: The Northern Section of the Beiping-Hankou Railway is Being Repaired Along with the Army; The Beiping-Zhangjiakou Section Can Be Open to Traffic on the 10th

[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] The railway repair work in the pacification zone is becoming more active with the military progress. The following is a summary of the road restoration situation from June to the end of October: Jiaoji Railway: Cangko-Dagu River section 41 kilometers, Guodian-Tanjiafang section 146 kilometers, Nanding-Boshan section 33 kilometers, Fangzi-Xiaogu section 9 kilometers. Jinpu Railway: Liguo-Lincheng section 25 kilometers. Longhai Railway: Damiao-Daxujia section 7.5 kilometers, Kaifeng-Xuzhou section 80 kilometers, Luowang-Dashan section 163 kilometers. Zhengtai Railway: Weishui-Luanchuan section 58 kilometers, Yuci-Touquan section 41 kilometers, Shanghu-Shouyang section 12 kilometers. Pingsui Railway: Sandaoying-Datong section 224 kilometers, Qinglongqiao-Huailai section 23 kilometers, Zhangjiakou-Xuanhua section 32 kilometers. (The remaining Datong-Zhangjiakou section 182 kilometers, Xuanhua-Huailai section 73 kilometers are under repair). The northern section of the Beiping-Hankou Railway has recently been destroyed and is being repaired along with the army.

[Our Northern Beijing Office, 7th] After the communist army in the northern section of the Beiping-Hankou Railway carried out large-scale destruction, the traffic situation in North China has improved compared with the past due to the efforts of the National Army to maintain and expand various lines. The number of sabotage incidents on the Beining Road has decreased compared to the past, and traffic is occasionally blocked. The Pingsui Line is about to complete the repair work on the Beiping-Zhangjiakou section, and it can be opened to traffic on the 10th. Currently, military vehicles are traveling to Huailai, and passenger cars are traveling to Kangzhuang. This section of the highway has also been completed, and freight vehicles are running smoothly. The Beicheng Line's northbound trains have reached Shili. The highway on this line can also directly reach Chengping from the 8th, handling passenger and freight transportation. The Jinpu Line is still open to Cangxian by the army. Because the southwest of Tianjin is a major base for the communist army, small groups of communist troops still occasionally attempt to sabotage the railway in the Tangguantun and Machang areas. The National Army is heavily guarded. After the Beiping-Baoding section of the Beiping-Hankou Road was opened, the communist army has lost its counter-offensive power. The repair work can reach Dingxing on the 7th, and this section of the highway can be repaired. At that time, about 100 trucks will replace the joint transportation by fire and military. The four stations of Yujiazhuang, Fangshunqiao, Wangdu, and Qingfengdian in Baoding South are still in the hands of the communist army. The northbound trains from Shijiazhuang are now traveling to Dingxian, and the opening of the four stations in the middle is not far away. The main force of the communist army in Rehe Province has mostly moved to the Northeast, and a small part is lurking on the Outer Great Wall Line. There are occasional small destructions between Pingquan and Lingyuan on the Jincheng Line. A section was destroyed by thirty bandits the day before yesterday.

[Our Northern Beijing Office, 7th] Traffic News: The repair of the Pingzhang section of the Pingsui Road is progressing rapidly, and it is expected to be connected near Shacheng on November 8. The Beiping-Tianjin Railway Administration is preparing to test the train on the 15th of this month.

### People from All Walks of Life in Hengyang Recommend Representatives to Go to Nanjing to Request the Construction of a War of Resistance Memorial City to Enhance National Awareness and Comfort the Souls of the Dead Soldiers and Civilians

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] In the autumn of the 33rd year of the Republic of China (1944), the enemy invaded Hengyang from the south. The defending army bravely resisted the enemy in the isolated city for as long as 47 days, unfolding one of the most magnificent and glorious pages in the history of the War of Resistance. The people's cooperation in delivering food and saving the wounded is an indelible page in the history of the War of Resistance. However, the city of Hengyang was subjected to the brutal shelling by the enemy for more than 40 days, making it difficult to recover. Therefore, the Hengyang City Council, the Chairman of the Wang Chi-Chang, the Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce Ou Bing-Rong and others formed a petition delegation to request the Central Government to build a war of resistance memorial city in Hengyang to encourage future generations, enhance national awareness, and comfort the souls of the dead soldiers and civilians.

It is said that the communist guerrillas systematically destroyed coal cars and freight cars in order to cut off supplies to the National Army in the Northeast. It was also said that a number of bridges in the same area had recently been bombed and damaged.

### UNRRA Supplies to China Pile Up on the West Coast of the United States: Shanghai Warehouses Gradually Become Empty

[News from this city] According to a spokesman for the Executive Headquarters of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), the recent strike by American sailors has affected the transportation of UNRRA supplies to China. After UNRRA announced the cancellation of the suspension order, a large number of relief supplies piled up on the west coast of the United States and could not be shipped to China. UNRRA supplies have not been able to arrive steadily, and the warehouses at Shanghai docks are gradually becoming empty. The number of supplies transported by this office to other ports in the past week has shown a downward trend. The statistics for the supplies transported by this office in the week from October 25 to November 1 are 17,387 tons, which is a difference of 25% compared with the previous week. The distribution of supplies in Shanghai has decreased by 12.2%. The total number of supplies distributed by this office this week is 20,856 tons, which is significantly inferior compared to the 32,000 tons of the previous week.

### Judgment on the Case of Traitor Zhou Fohai

Special Criminal Judgment of the Capital High Court (Thirty-fifth Year, Special Character No. 346)

Prosecutor: Prosecutor of this Court

Defendant: Zhou Fohai, male, fifty years old, native of Yuanling County, Hunan Province, former Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, residing at No. 8, Xiliu Bay, Nanjing, currently in custody.

Appointed Defense Attorneys: Lawyer Zhang Shizhao

Lawyer Wang Shanxiang

Lawyer Yang Jialin

The above-named defendant, due to the case of being a traitor, having been prosecuted by the prosecutor, this Court judges as follows:

Main Text

Zhou Fohai colluded with an enemy country, plotted to resist his own country, sentenced to death, deprived of all public rights for life, and all property confiscated, except for the necessary living expenses for his family, which shall be retained.

Facts

Intentional Betrayal, Violation of Established National Policy

During his studies in Japan, Zhou Fohai was originally a member of the Communist Party, later joining the Kuomintang, and successively served as Director of the Political Department of the General Headquarters of the National Revolutionary Army, Member of the Jiangsu Provincial Government concurrently Director of the Department of Education, Minister of the Central People's Training Department, and Minister of the Central Propaganda Department. In the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), the Sino-Japanese War broke out, and the enemy's forces were rampant. During the fierce Battle of Shanghai, Zhou Fohai, together with Mei Siping, Gao Zongwu, and others, secretly discussed making peace at his home (No. 8, Xiliu Bay, Nanjing), which was then known as the "Low-Key Club." After the fall of Nanjing and Shanghai, the National Government decided on a long-term resistance and moved west to Chongqing. Zhou Fohai then intentionally violated the central government's established national policy, taking Wang Jingwei as the center and brewing a peace movement, becoming even more active. First, Mei Siping and Gao Zongwu secretly went to Shanghai in mid-November of the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938) to discuss a basic plan for peace that would cede rights and humiliate the country with Yoshibumi Kageyama and Imai Takeo, representatives of the Japanese military. Then, on November 27th, they transferred from Shanghai to Hong Kong and flew to Chongqing, secretly reporting to Wang Jingwei. After Wang Jingwei approved, Zhou Fohai intentionally betrayed the central government, under the pretext of the Minister of the Central Propaganda Department going out to inspect, first left Chongqing on December 6th for Kunming, and on the 19th of the same month, transferred to Hanoi, Vietnam. Wang Jingwei also fled to Hanoi on the 20th. On the 23rd, Japanese Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe, based on the conditions negotiated by Mei Siping and others, issued a statement. Wang Jingwei also drafted a telegram, which he handed over to Zhou Fohai, Chen Gongbo, and others to take to Hong Kong, and handed it over to Lin Baisheng and Mei Siping to jointly sign and be responsible for, and sent it to the newspaper on the night of the 30th for publication (delayed for one day due to Gu Mengyu's opposition), responding to Konoe's statement, hoping to confuse public opinion and shake the determination to resist.

Secret Negotiations with the Enemy, Constantly Following Wang Jingwei

On April 12th of the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939), Zhou Fohai and Mei Siping went to Shanghai together to gather party members and promote the peace movement. Soon, Gao Zongwu and Wang Jingwei also arrived in Shanghai one after another, and they discussed with Kageyama Yoshisada and others to obtain the consent of the enemy authorities. Zhou Fohai, Mei Siping, Gao Zongwu, Zhou Longku, and others accompanied Wang Jingwei to Tokyo, Japan, to secretly discuss peace conditions with enemy leaders. After returning to China, they once again used peace, anti-communism, and nation-building as slogans, and held the Sixth Pseudo-National Congress of the Kuomintang in Shanghai, issuing a declaration. Zhou Fohai was elected as a Standing Committee Member of the Pseudo-Central Executive Committee. In November, he, together with Mei Siping, Lin Baisheng, Zhou Longxiang, Gao Zongwu, and others, discussed the "Draft of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty" with Japanese representatives Kageyama Yoshizaki and Suga. Later, Gao Zongwu and others discovered their conscience and went to Hong Kong, exposing the inside story in the Ta Kung Pao, and then fled to the rear. Zhou Fohai, however, remained obsessed and followed Wang Jingwei. On January 20th of the 29th year of the Republic of China (1940), he attended the Qingdao Conference, where he discussed reorganization issues with the "Provisional" and "Reform" puppet governments. He also participated in the pseudo-Central Political Conference from March 20th to 22nd of the same year, which decided on the plan for adjusting the new Sino-Japanese relationship, the program of the pseudo-National Government, the organizational regulations of the pseudo-Central Political Committee and the pseudo-North China Political Affairs Committee, and determined the name of the pseudo-National Government, and appointed candidates for various courts and departments.

Serving in Various Pseudo-Positions, Following the Will of the Japanese Invaders

On March 30th, the pseudo-National Government was jointly established in Nanjing in the manner of the National Government returning to its capital, and it issued a declaration that all government orders and treaties and agreements of our National Government, both domestic and foreign, were invalid. Wang Jingwei himself served as Chairman and concurrently President of the Pseudo-Executive Yuan, Zhou Fohai served as Minister of the Pseudo-Ministry of Finance, and also served concurrently as Standing Committee Member of the Pseudo-Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters Executive Committee, Chairman of the Pseudo-Central Financial Committee, Member and Secretary-General of the Pseudo-Central Political Committee, Member and Secretary-General of the Pseudo-Supreme National Defense Conference, Member of the Pseudo-Military Commission, Vice President of the Pseudo-Executive Yuan, President of the Pseudo-Central Reserve Bank, Chief of the Pseudo-Tax Police Regiment, Chairman of the Pseudo-Enemy Property Management Committee, Chairman of the Pseudo-Materials Control Review Committee, and Deputy Chairman of the Pseudo-Military Commission. He also held positions such as Member of the Rural Clearing Committee, Mayor of the Pseudo-Shanghai Special Municipality concurrently Commander of the Pseudo-Shanghai Security Forces and Director of the Shanghai Special Municipality Police Bureau, holding great power and highly trusted by Wang Jingwei. During his tenure in the pseudo-positions, he followed the will of the Japanese invaders, issued counterfeit currency wantonly, disrupted finance, and supplied the enemy with money and materials, in order to increase the strength of the enemy's invasion. On November 30th of the 29th year of the Republic of China (1940), the Pseudo-National Government officially signed the "Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty" with the Japanese invaders in Nanjing, allowing the Japanese invaders to station troops in Mengjiang and North China, and station fleets in our country's territorial waters and rivers, and implement economic cooperation. At the same time, it issued a joint declaration between China, Japan, and Manchuria, recognizing the Pseudo-Manchukuo, in order to destroy the integrity of our country's territory. On June 14th of the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941), Zhou Fohai accompanied Wang Jingwei to visit the Japanese government and people, and concluded an agreement on the conversion of foreign funds of the pseudo-Central Reserve Bank into Japanese yen, and borrowed 300 million Japanese yen to support the pseudo-government's economy. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, he echoed the Japanese invaders and declared war on the Allied nations of Britain and the United States on January 9th of the 32nd year of the Republic of China (1943) in the name of the pseudo-National Government. On October 30th of the same year, he concluded a treaty of alliance with the Japanese invaders, declaring that they would live and die together. Zhou Fohai also visited Pseudo-Manchukuo in the name of a special envoy, in order to flatter the enemy. Other crimes of harming the country and the people are too numerous to mention. Zhou Fohai attached himself to Wang Jingwei, openly advocating peace, and participated in it until the Japanese invaders surrendered and the pseudo-organization disintegrated. He was induced and arrested by the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Military Commission and transferred to the prosecutor of this court for prosecution.

Reasons

In this case, the defendant Zhou Fohai, regarding the above-mentioned attachment to Wang Jingwei, violating the central government's established national policy, privately advocating peace, secretly negotiating conditions with the Japanese invaders to cede rights and humiliate the country, to the point of jointly organizing the pseudo-National Government, signing the "Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty," allowing the Japanese invaders to station troops and warships in our country's territory, implementing economic cooperation, and issuing a joint declaration between China, Japan, and Manchukuo, recognizing Pseudo-Manchukuo, destroying the integrity of the territory, declaring war on the Allied nations of Britain and the United States in the name of the pseudo-government, the defendant visiting Pseudo-Manchukuo in the name of a pseudo-envoy, the pseudo-Central Reserve Bank he presided over issuing 41 trillion yuan of counterfeit currency, prohibiting the people from using legal tender, disrupting finance, supplying the enemy with money and materials, and serving in various important pseudo-positions in both the party and government, until the surrender of the Japanese invaders, all of these circumstances have been confessed in detail and without reservation during similar investigations or trials, and can be proven by publications such as the pseudo-"National Government Gazette," the pseudo-"Ministry of Finance Gazette," the pseudo-Propaganda Department's compiled "Peace, Anti-Communism, and Nation-Building Documents," "Chairman Wang's Speeches During His Visit to Japan," "Chairman Wang's Visit to Japan Memorial Pictorial," and "Selected Capitals in the Fourth Year Pictorial," and the Japanese Yoshida Jizo's edited "The Current Situation in Central China" (a separate catalog is attached to this judgment). In addition, after the organization of the pseudo-government, he shamelessly served the enemy and acted as an accomplice, and his evil deeds of harming the country and the people are not only sufficient to prove by various pseudo-official documents and newspaper clippings at the time, but also are commonly seen and heard by Chinese and foreign people. It is undoubtedly and undeniably that the fact that the defendant colluded with Wang Jingwei and others to collude with an enemy country and plotted to resist his own country has been clearly and obviously established. However, what should be investigated is whether the defendant's reasons for defense can be established, which are discussed separately below:

No Room for Sophistry, the Pseudo-Government Harmed the Country and the People

(1) According to the defense, the organization of the pseudo-government was to test peace, shake the enemy's military morale, reduce the suffering of the people in the occupied areas, and that the organization of the pseudo-government in the occupied areas had no impact on the anti-Japanese camp. However, resistance to the end was the central government's established national policy. On November 12th of the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), the National Government moved to Chongqing and declared, "Recently, the violent Japanese have become even more greedy and unscrupulous, dividing their troops to advance westward, forcing our capital, and their intention is nothing more than to use their violence to force us into an alliance under the city, but they do not know that from the day our country decided to resist and defend ourselves, we have deeply known that this is the final moment. For the sake of the country's life, for the sake of the nation's personality, for the sake of international integrity and world peace, there is no room for surrender. All those with blood and spirit are determined to be jade fragments rather than tiles. The National Government is now moving to Chongqing today in order to adapt to the war situation, coordinate the overall situation, and engage in a more long-term battle on the largest scale." This was announced to the entire country. The defendant received higher education and had considerable status in various party and government circles, especially as the Minister of the CCP Propaganda Department at the time. Every word and action was enough to affect the views of China and foreign countries. However, he betrayed the central government with Wang Jingwei and others, organized the pseudo-government, and issued distorted remarks such as, "Resisting to the end, what is the end? Where is the end? If you don't want to talk about peace, then how is it different from saying that you want to resist until death?" (See the defendant's self-written "Memories and Prospects" article, published in "Peace, Anti-Communism, and Nation-Building Documents"), wanting to confuse the nation's hearing with his own inaccurate understanding, trying to reduce the anti-Japanese sentiment. For a time, people's hearts were shaken. If the central leadership had not been effective, the anti-Japanese camp would have almost collapsed. Now he still says that it was to test peace and did not hinder the anti-Japanese war. Is he deceiving himself or deceiving others? As for all the measures taken by the pseudo-government in the occupied areas, such as recruiting pseudo-soldiers, selling opium publicly, plundering materials, enslaving young people, using clearing the countryside as a pretext, and implementing blockades, none of them were not acts of harming the country and the people. He even said that it was to save the people and relieve suffering, which is completely reversing right and wrong. Furthermore, since the establishment of the pseudo-government, pseudo-soldiers have been trained, which not only consolidated the enemy's rear but also helped the enemy attack our defense lines, so that the enemy's flames became more intense and the invasion became deeper. The defendant's so-called shaking the enemy's military morale had the opposite effect. The facts are all there, and there is no room for sophistry.

The So-Called Self-Examination Does Not Conform to the Conditions and Facts

(2) According to the defense, the defendant once entrusted someone to surrender to the central government in the winter of the 31st year of the Republic of China (1942), providing military intelligence, establishing radio stations, deploying military affairs, assisting the National Army in counterattacks, rescuing central underground workers, and assisting the central government in developing party affairs and culture in the occupied areas. However, the defendant had already been wanted by the Supreme Court Prosecutor's Office on November 4th of the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939), and did not automatically surrender and be tried before the crime was discovered. Moreover, the regulations on traitors' surrender have stricter special conditions. Article 1 states that traitors who surrender before being discovered and meet one of the following conditions may be exempted from punishment or the execution of their punishment: (1) Reporting other traitor cases that have been confirmed by judgment or finding important evidence that is indeed valuable. (2) Exposing the dangerous schemes and strategies of traitors or spies that are indeed credible. (3) Secretly reporting enemy secrets that are indeed beneficial to our country. (4) Bringing weapons to offer. May I ask whether the defendant has any factual manifestations of one of the above four situations and can provide conclusive evidence? Moreover, according to the testimonies and written statements of various witnesses, the defendant had the intention to surrender in the winter of the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941), but failed to reach the central government. The subsequent surrender was also proven by the Military Intelligence Bureau to have no such fact. Therefore, the defendant's so-called surrender is not only inconsistent with the conditions but also inconsistent with the facts, and can be ignored.

Preparing for a Counterattack is Even More of No Commendable Merit

As for rescuing underground workers, secretly reporting enemy information, contacting the National Army, cooperating with the Allied forces, preparing for a counterattack, and developing party affairs and culture in the occupied areas, according to the testimonies and written statements of various witnesses, it is also specious. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the defendant, either out of personal friendship or for other purposes, did occasionally lend a hand to rescue a small number of central underground workers, but over the years, countless underground workers have been captured and sacrificed by the enemy and puppets. In the areas of Nanjing and Shanghai, almost all of them have been wiped out. The number of people who have been rescued and can prove it is only a few. Weighing the pros and cons, what can be said about assisting the anti-Japanese war or benefiting the people? As the witness Ma Yuanfang said in his letter of proof, he did not dare to influence the country's public affairs with his personal private affairs. Furthermore, according to the letters from the headquarters of the First Security Column, the Second Security Column, and the Third Security Column, proving the close connection and secret consultation for the National Army's counterattack, regardless of whether it conforms to the case approved by the Supreme National Defense Committee that "personnel against traitors must be formally certified by the highest-level officers of each unit or special agent and commissioned in advance before approval is granted," the units themselves, due to the Japanese invaders' surrender, did not have the opportunity to counterattack and did not establish special merits, and the defendant is even more of no commendable merit. Furthermore, the Military Intelligence Bureau's reply and transfer documents also only stated that the defendant expressed his regret for his actions in order to rescue his mother and father-in-law Yang Zirong, who were both arrested and detained, and to leave a way out for the future. Since being approved for planning and use, he has been lukewarm and initially showed no results. After further planning and strengthening the use, he began to provide cover for underground workers and provide a small amount of funding. This is the same as the situation mentioned in the Army General Headquarters' reply that the defendant expressed his willingness to use the puppet army in the autumn of the 33rd year of the Republic of China (1944) to rebel at the right time and cooperate with the National Army's counterattack, which has been secretly reported to the central government. However, the area that the defendant was willing to support, the Allied forces have not yet landed, and the puppet army has not yet rebelled. The defendant has contact with the central government, but he has not assisted in the anti-Japanese war. It is impossible to use future facts as a basis for excusing guilt. It is very clear that the defendant saw the Allied forces winning victories one after another and the enemy's situation was dire, and only then did he have some contact with the personnel under the central government, but upon inspection of his later words and actions, he still did his best to resist the central government and slander the government, only showing his fence-sitting and double-dealing. As for party affairs and culture in the occupied areas, it is even more hateful. At that time, the pseudo-organization's efforts to handle party affairs and culture in order to absorb the masses were all in accordance with the enemy's will, cultivating enslaved young people and promoting enslaved education. How can it be considered a beneficial act for the people? The evidence submitted by the defendant, which he believes needs to be investigated, has been reviewed one by one and is not sufficient for reference in sentencing.

Issuing Counterfeit Currency, the People Suffered Considerable Losses

(3) According to the defense, the issuance of the pseudo-Central Reserve Notes was to resist the enemy's wanton issuance of military tickets, plunder of materials, and control of prices. It is unthinkable that the enemy's use of military tickets only extended to a small number of strongholds where the enemy troops were stationed and could not deeply affect the people or extract materials from the rear inland areas, and could not achieve the purpose of control and plunder. Therefore, the enemy instigated the pseudo-government to issue counterfeit currency and provide it in large quantities for its purposes. The defendant, with considerable knowledge, could not have been unaware of the advantages and disadvantages of this situation. However, the defendant and others intended to permanently seize the country's territory and overthrow the central government, and there was a need to manipulate finance. Therefore, under the circumstances of mutual use, the so-called national bank of the pseudo-government issued counterfeit currency, called it the New Legal Tender, and exchanged it for legal tender at a rate of two to one. At the same time, it promulgated regulations hindering the New Legal Tender, prohibiting the people from using legal tender, and severely punishing violators. On the one hand, it issued counterfeit currency without restriction, flooding the market, so that prices soared. The property of our people in the occupied areas was reduced by half for no reason, and they suffered considerable losses indirectly due to the impact of prices. From then on, the Japanese invaders were able to demand whatever they wanted from the pseudo-Central Reserve Bank. Although there were borrowing agreements in name, they not only had no intention of repaying the debt in their minds, but also did not recognize the qualifications of the creditor. In the beginning, our rear inland areas, because the enemy and puppets exchanged the legal tender they obtained at a rate of two to one and extracted materials from the inland areas, prices suddenly soared, financial turmoil ensued, and the necessary items decreased day by day. If it were not for the extraordinary situation, planning and deliberation, the people's public loyalty to the country, and the confidence in the victory of the anti-Japanese war, with one heart and one mind, responding appropriately, then they would not have succumbed to the military but would have failed in the economy. Thinking of it now, there are still regrets. (Ordinary shortsighted people still complain about the high prices, but they do not know that it is actually the poison of the Japanese invaders' plunder of materials and the pseudo-government's issuance of counterfeit currency.) This kind of evil deed is obvious to everyone. The defendant, even with the tongue of a reed, has no room for embellishment and evasion. What should be explained is that after the Japanese invaders had surrendered, the counterfeit currency was still issued in large quantities (according to the supply, the amount issued was 41 trillion yuan, which is inconsistent with the number published in the newspaper. In fact, it is definitely more than this number, and there is no way to calculate it now). All the personnel of the various organs in the area belonging to the pseudo-government were generally issued dissolution fees. For example, Wang Wenying was issued 40,000 yuan, and Ma Jiliang was issued 30 million yuan (both of which were supplied with volumes that can be verified). Even if it is converted at a rate of 200 to one, it is not a small number, which is probably not what ordinary small people can reach. If it is desired to increase the burden on the disaster-stricken people after the catastrophe, then those who presided over the issuance of counterfeit currency, such as the defendant, cannot but bear a major responsibility.

Joint Principal Offender, How Can There Be No Responsibility for Signing the Treaty?

(4) According to the defense, the defendant only participated in the signing of the treaty with the Japanese invaders and had no right to sign it. The declaration of war on Britain and the United States was all done by Wang Jingwei alone. At that time, he visited Pseudo-Manchukuo in the name of a pseudo-envoy, and the national flag was hung and the national anthem was sung everywhere he went, which was actually meritorious. How can it be said that he was flattering the enemy? The defendant, together with Mei Siping and others, taking Wang Jingwei as the center, jointly organized the pseudo-government and held important positions. They had a connection of intent and division of labor for all the treasonous acts issued by the pseudo-government, both internally and externally, and cannot but bear the responsibility of a joint principal offender. How can he claim that he only participated and had no right to sign it and stand aloof? How can he push the declaration of war on Britain and the United States onto Wang Jingwei alone? Moreover, the treaty with the Japanese invaders, declaring that they would live and die together, was enough to shake people's hearts. The declaration of war on the Allied nations of Britain and the United States isolated our central anti-Japanese camp, and it was undoubtedly an act of resisting his own country. As for the fact that Pseudo-Manchukuo was completely under the power of the Japanese invaders at that time, even if the masses occasionally saw the national flag and heard the national anthem, it would not help. The defendant's visit to Pseudo-Manchukuo was a clear performance of flattering the enemy, how can he be allowed to arbitrarily quibble?

Maintaining Public Order, the Central Government's Divine Plan and Wonderful Calculation

(5) According to the defense, after the victory, the defendant was appointed as the captain of the Shanghai Action Team,恪遵中央意旨, responsible for maintaining public order in Shanghai and along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, preventing traitors and puppets, and stabilizing people's hearts. When the National Army and the central receiving personnel arrived in Shanghai one after another, they handed over all the military police under their command to the central receiving personnel, which was not without merit. Regarding this point, according to the Military Intelligence Bureau's transfer documents and replies, it is indeed the truth. However, referring to the letters and telegrams from the late Director Dai submitted by the defendant, it can be seen that our supreme commander initially took into consideration the people in the occupied areas, who had been displaced for eight years, and were in great suffering, and could no longer tolerate unnecessary harassment at the time of victory, as well as to avoid other kinds of losses, so he had to have this expedient measure. This is a strategy of responding to the emergency and is also the painstaking effort of those who seek the country, and is by no means a pardon for heinous traitors. Therefore, the central government broadcast at the time that in all areas occupied by the enemy and puppets, the original enemy and puppet troops and officers must stay at their posts and maintain local order, not only in the Shanghai-Hangzhou area. Specifically, Commander-in-Chief He's published speech reported in the newspaper: "Although Zhou Fohai surrendered earlier, because of his important position in a certain organization, he has also been taken into custody," and the Military Intelligence Bureau's closure case official letter stated: "Upon investigation, Zhou Fohai, Ding Mocun, Luo Junzhang, Yang Xinghua, Ma Jiliang, and other five traitors were induced and arrested by this bureau in Shanghai on September 30th of last year. However, at that time, the National Army that received the surrender in Shanghai and Hangzhou had just arrived, traitors and bandits were surrounding, and people's hearts were fluctuating. If the two traitors Zhou and Ding were detained in Shanghai, it would affect the psychology of all the officers and soldiers of the pseudo-Tax Police Regiment controlled by Zhou and Ding, as well as the Shanghai and Hangzhou pseudo-Security Teams, the twelve regiments of the pseudo-12th Army, and the 132 divisions of the pseudo-Guard Army, and affect the public order of Shanghai and Hangzhou. Therefore, it was approved to send Zhou and Ding and other traitors to Chongqing for detention. Now all the major traitors in various places have been arrested, and a special envoy is assigned to escort Zhou Fohai and other five traitors, together with the original volume, and a letter is sent for your inspection and acceptance, and handling according to law." By observing and mutually verifying each of the above-mentioned statements, it can be seen even more how thoughtful and comprehensive the measures were at the beginning, and what the intention was. It is clearly revealed. However, the defendant was incorrigible, defied the law, and dared to claim in his answer that "the enemy and puppets surrendered, and for almost a month, no soldier of the central government arrived in Shanghai. During this period, it was not that no one persuaded the defendant to use Shanghai as a base to establish a new banner. If he had no choice, he could also plunder the wealth of Shanghai and take the troops to Jiangbei. To say it very presumptuously today, at that time, as long as the defendant said a word or nodded, the situation in the southeast would change," then his rebellious and unpredictable state is evident on paper. He even wanted to continue to ravage the local area after colluding with the enemy and trampling it for eight years. Here, we even more admire the central government's divine plan and wonderful calculation, anticipating things like a god, and finally making the most heinous criminals submit and be brought to justice, and his plan failed.

Abandoned by the People of the Country, He Actually Speaks Shamelessly

From this point of view, the defendant relies on his talent and is good at adapting, his words are insincere, he is fickle, and he is full of tricks. His claims of how he was willing to sincerely submit to the central government, assist the anti-Japanese war, help underground workers, establish radio stations, and provide intelligence are all untrustworthy. Also, the defendant said, "As long as I say a word or nod, the situation in the southeast will change." I don't know what he is referring to. Even if the Japanese troops in China still had a million troops, once they surrendered, they would have to obey orders and surrender their weapons. The army controlled by the defendant was only tens of thousands. Even if he had a plan, it would only be a temporary pleasure, and how could he permanently carve out a territory as a hero? Moreover, his subordinates' troops, not without those who deeply understand righteousness, may not be willing to be used by the defendant. If he is referring to something else, then brothers protect the walls to resist external insults, which is a clear teaching from ancient times. As for the defendant's selling out the country for personal gain, he has already been abandoned by the people of the country. No matter where he goes, south or north, to the barbarians or the Yue, no one will be willing to join hands with him. However, he speaks shamelessly, sows discord, and uses every trick he can. He is so inconsistent and fickle, and his words are deeply hateful. Therefore, after the victory, his maintaining local order and handing over all the military police were due to the general trend, and he had no choice but to do so. What merit can be said of it?

Difficult to Cover Up Major Transgressions, Do Not Conceal Great Guilt

Finally, it should be pointed out that the defendant speaks of political theory and then of legal theory, as if politics and law are two completely different paths. It is necessary to know that politics is to seek the welfare of the majority of people, and law is a reflection of politics. If you want to reform politics, you should use legal procedures and use the will of the majority of people to first amend the national law. You are not allowed to violate laws and regulations and establish another regime. If that were the case, why would various countries in the world have sanctions for political criminals (but according to international law, political criminals may refuse extradition), and why would there be provisions for the crime of internal rebellion in the criminal law? Because the defendant's daily remarks are absurd and chaotic, he is questioned and辩解d at the trial, fearing that the ordinary people cannot measure it, he has to be detailed in his accusations to dispel the doubts of the world and future generations. Since the Japanese invaders have been plotting to annex our country for a long time, from September 18th onwards, they have been gradually advancing, seizing our four northeastern provinces, sending troops to Inner Mongolia, invading Pingjin, and developing into the July 7th Incident. Our National Government could no longer bear it and rose up to resist and decided to be jade fragments rather than tiles and engage in a more protracted battle. All those with blood and spirit have the same hatred for the enemy. The defendant, however, was特達-ly known by the central government and repeatedly held important positions. During the war, he was responsible for the mission of propaganda, and his position was important. He should have worked together with one heart and reported to the country with all his loyalty. However, in the autumn of the enemy's deep invasion and the country's danger, he left the anti-Japanese camp, privately communicated with the enemy, willingly attached himself to the rebellion, betrayed the central government, and only sought to realize his personal political ambitions, regardless of the survival of the country and the nation. If the central government had not insisted on resisting to the end, and the supreme commander had not directed the right direction and had effective offensive and defensive plans, our country would have been陷於萬卻不復之地位 - pushed into a point of no return. To dare to take such risks is unforgivable by the law. Even if he has some minor merit, it is difficult to cover up major transgressions. Even if he has some small achievements, do not conceal great guilt. Weighing the severity, the sentence should not be lenient. He should be sentenced to the maximum penalty and deprived of public rights for life to extend the dignity of the national law and correct the people's vision. All property shall be confiscated except for the necessary living expenses for his family.

Based on the above arguments and conclusions, according to Article 1 of the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Ordinance, the preceding paragraph of Article 291 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Article 1, Article 2, Paragraph 1 of Article 1, Article 8, Paragraph 1, Article 9 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, the preceding paragraph of Article 2, Paragraph 1, Article 28, Article 37, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, judgment is rendered as stated in the main text.

### Editorial: Examining Our Nation's Constitution Through the Lens of the American Election

The results of the American general election have reached China just as the National Assembly is preparing to convene as scheduled. According to repeated statements from government authorities, the primary purpose of this National Assembly is to formulate the fundamental law of the land, namely, the Constitution. It is truly regrettable that, 35 years after the founding of the Republic of China, we still do not have a Constitution. This is not to say that our country has been without a fundamental law. After the Nationalist Revolutionary Army eliminated the warlord and feudal forces in our country, we entered the period of political tutelage according to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. During this period, we had the Provisional Constitution for the Period of Political Tutelage as the fundamental law of the land. The reason a formal constitution was not designated was that the period of political tutelage had not ended, and the reason the period of political tutelage had not ended was the invasion by Japan and the outbreak of full-scale war of resistance. Now that the Japanese invasion has been defeated and our country's war of resistance has been won, the formulation of our country's constitution has had to wait until after victory, hence the convening of the National Assembly to formulate a constitution. Before this, China was not without attempts to create a constitution, but under the circumstances of warlord separatism and the rampant resurgence of feudal forces, the formulation of a constitution seemed almost like child's play, so we saw constitutions being formulated and then immediately abandoned. This has continued for more than 30 years. Now that the National Assembly is about to convene as scheduled, and the results of the American election have just become known before the convening, the scrutiny of the American Constitution sparked by this election should serve as a reference for the National Assembly's constitution-making process.

The issue regarding the American Constitution raised by this American election is perhaps best exemplified by Senator Fulbright's suggestion that President Truman resign. His reasoning was that the Republican Party had gained a majority in both the House and Senate, and Truman should immediately appoint a Republican Senator as Secretary of State and resign from the presidency. At the same time, news reports indicate that British newspapers are discussing the separation of powers in American politics in complex terms, with an undertone filled with criticisms of this system as being outdated. This is indeed an issue worthy of attention and exploration. Senator Fulbright's remarks, at best, represent only personal opinions, but they contain extremely serious issues. This is that if an election can represent the public will of the people, then this American election has already indicated that the American people's inclination is toward the Republican Party and not the ruling Democratic Party. If the same situation occurred in Britain, the party in power would immediately step aside, and the party favored by the people would take power. Last year's British general election was precisely because the Labor Party gained a controlling majority in Parliament, forcing the highly respected Churchill and the Conservative Party he led to step down voluntarily, allowing the Labor Party, which had won the general election, to take power. This is the unwritten British constitution. However, in the United States, the Constitution, formulated under the influence of 18th-century political ideals, has a clear separation of powers; therefore, even if the results of this general election show that the people favor the Republican Party, President Truman still has two years left in his term, so the results of this election have not affected the reorganization of the government. President Truman and the Democratic Party he leads, even though they have lost the support of the people, can still remain in office for at least two more years. During these two years, with the Republican Party holding an absolute majority in Congress, President Truman, as the head of the executive branch belonging to a minority party, will inevitably face serious difficulties. The situation faced by President Wilson after World War I is unexpectedly being replayed today.

Therefore, the results of this American election should give our country's soon-to-be-formulated constitution a profound lesson. That is, first, we should not be bound by obsolete political ideals, but must break free from those outdated political ideals; second, we should cherish the legacy of our nation's early pioneers, and should formulate a fundamental law of the land that neither blindly follows foreign conventions nor fails to adapt to our country's national conditions, thus setting an example. The American Constitution, characterized by the checks and balances of the three branches of government, is not sufficient as a model, and the British system and the political systems of other countries may also not meet our country's needs. The emergence of the Soviet system in the Soviet Union has its historical background, and the emergence of the British system in Britain also has its historical factors. None of these are things that China can blindly follow. We must break free from these biases or preconceptions and formulate our own country's fundamental law.

Fortunately, our founding father Dr. Sun Yat-sen had already seen this point, and thus left the legacy of the Five-Power Constitution. This is truly a valuable legacy for us, free from the drawbacks of the separation of three powers and the evils of one-power dominance; the division of powers and functions is clear, and the system is carefully structured. How we should cherish this valuable legacy! Unfortunately, the people of our country have not yet cherished this valuable legacy. The "May 5th Draft Constitution" formulated by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated by the National Government is a manifestation of the ideals of the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution, but the gentlemen of the Political Consultative Conference. This is truly regrettable. Of course, although the "May 5th Draft Constitution" has been repeatedly reviewed by the Legislative Yuan, considering thoroughness without seeking perfection, there may inevitably be some aspects that are not yet satisfactory; however, the spirit of the five powers and the theory of power and function must not be changed in the slightest. Now that the National Assembly is about to convene as scheduled, [unintelligible characters] may be able to avoid foreign conventions and fully express the spirit of our valuable legacy, in order to establish a foundation for the long-term peace and stability of the nation.

### American Domestic and Foreign Affairs After the General Election

The election of members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives was held on the 5th of this month. Initial results from various states show that the Republican Party, which has been in the opposition for fourteen years, has actually defeated the Democratic Party and won a victory; not only is it sufficient to control both the Senate and the House, but the belief that it will win the 1948 presidential election has also been strengthened.

This victory of the Republican Party was indeed expected. President Truman's failure can be said to be the same as President Wilson's failure after World War I. The American people have been under the rule of the Democratic Party for fourteen years, and have long been weary of the Democratic Party's domestic and foreign policies and its consistent style; their hope for a change of ruling party has long existed, so this victory of the Republican Party is by no means accidental, and can be said to be opportune. Apart from this, there are also the following factors: (1) After the end of the war, the attention of the American people has shifted from abroad to domestic affairs; during the war, the focus was on military victory and diplomatic success; but after the war, the concern is with domestic reforms and economic recovery. The reason why the Labor Party was able to defeat the Conservative Party in the British general election last May was precisely because of this. The British people, having been under the rule of the Conservative Party for a long time, had long felt "enough," so they wanted the Labor Party to take power; similarly, the Chinese people, having been under the rule of the Democratic Party for a long time, had long felt "enough," so they wanted the Republican Party to take power. (2) Although President Truman also belongs to the Democratic Party, and has repeatedly stated that the policies he has adopted still follow the will of the late President Roosevelt; it is undeniable that President Truman has not been able to fully continue to implement Roosevelt's policies. For example, he abandoned price controls, causing prices in the United States to rise generally, and making life difficult for the general public, so demands for increased wages and labor strikes have emerged one after another. Therefore, President Truman has long lost the trust of the people, and this failure of the Democratic Party was also an inevitable result. (3) Repeated frictions in personnel relations have also weakened President Truman's domestic position and prestige. President Truman's discord with Congress has often caused disagreements between the White House and Congress. Although the President has repeatedly used his veto power, he has often lacked tact, causing rifts within the Democratic Party. At the same time, within the government itself, due to the issue of foreign policy, the former Secretary of Commerce Wallace actually disagreed with Secretary of State Byrnes. Although Wallace resigned, and Harriman succeeded him, after this uproar, the rifts within the American government became irreparable. This has also reduced President Truman's prestige.

After the opening of the 80th U.S. Congress, the Senate and House of Representatives will be completely under the control of the Republican Party; however, President Truman still has a full two years before the expiration of his term; during these two years, President Truman's implementation of any policy will be subject to congressional constraints. Especially in domestic affairs, the Republican Party has many dissatisfactions with President Truman's policies. For example: (1) the issue of maintaining compulsory military service; (2) the issue of merging the Army and Navy; (3) the issue of accelerating housing construction to solve the housing shortage; (4) the issue of fiscal balance; (5) the issue of price controls; (6) the issue of resolving labor strikes and unemployment; (7) the issue of reducing wartime high tax rates. Disputes between Congress and the government over the above issues will emerge one after another. How will President Truman handle himself in this environment? This is indeed a serious issue. As former President Hoover said: "In recent years, the entire world, including the United States, has been moving leftward on the road to economic omnipotence, but now the United States, after this general election, will be the first country to abandon this path." Former Secretary of Commerce Wallace also said: "A Congress dominated by the Republican Party will make American economic problems even more complex. The results of this general election mean that the Democratic Party cannot progress, and will be reduced."

In terms of foreign policy, the Republican Party's victory will not have a significant impact. Because the policies adopted by Secretary of State Byrnes are greatly influenced by Republican Senator Vandenberg, the U.S. delegation attends any international conference, whether it is the foreign ministers' meeting or the Paris Peace Conference, or even the United Nations General Assembly, Vandenberg Austria is under the direction of Vandenberg. Soviet newspapers or radio stations have recently criticized the current U.S. policy, accusing the Republican Party of being the new instigators of war. The attacks on Vandenberg himself are even more relentless. Therefore, French political figures, upon hearing the news of the Republican Party's victory, expressed anxiety, and wondered whether the U.S. attitude towards the Soviet Union would become more hardened. French leftists are also worried that the United States will be unwilling to provide economic assistance to European countries. These worries do not seem to be unfounded. At the same time, British diplomatic observers also say that Byrnes will continue to pursue the current foreign policy, in other words, on the one hand, the United States is unwilling to make concessions to the Soviet Union alone; on the other hand, the United States is unwilling to ignore the politics that occur within the Soviet sphere of influence. Therefore, it is expected that there will be no major changes in U.S. foreign policy in the future, and there may not be any immediate hope for an improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations. As the Soviet newspaper Red Star commented on the American general election: "There is little difference between the American Democratic Party and the Republican Party today. This can be seen in the tough stance adopted by the United States towards the Soviet Union. This election has added unlimited hope to the 1948 presidential election. As far as American politics are concerned, it is indeed a major change; however, in terms of its foreign policy, there is little impact. Because in today's United States, although there is a division between the Republican Party and the Democratic Party, and each has different policies on domestic affairs; their opinions on foreign policy are completely consistent. President Truman has always respected the Republican Party's opinions in making decisions on foreign policy; therefore, in the future, Congress and the government may cause disputes over domestic affairs, but they will not cause differences over foreign policy.

How Difficult It Is to Be a Doctor and a Hospital

People throughout society seem to have very little understanding of the medical profession. Traditional thinking assumes that practicing medicine is a charitable undertaking. Doctors should not only diagnose illnesses for free, but also provide medicine. Only in this way does it conform to the principle of compassion. This was indeed the case in the days of our grandfathers and fathers, because doctors then were "needed" and "scholarly gentlemen" would occasionally prescribe a remedy to relatives and friends after reading the Treatise on Cold Damage and Miscellaneous Diseases and books of verified prescriptions – what could be better? When encountering a poor patient who couldn't afford to pay, it was no problem to take out their own pharmacy ledger and give away a few doses of medicine, because in the eyes of these "gentlemen," practicing medicine was, at most, only a "side business"—but things are very different now. A doctor from a formal school has to go through six years of elementary school, six years of middle school, and six years of university studies, examinations, and licensing. After working in a large hospital for at least four or five years, their experience and knowledge are combined, and they can practice medicine without endangering lives. It takes these twenty-odd years of cultivation and the expenditure of countless amounts of money from fathers and elder brothers before they can become independent. When they have a full beard, they need to start a family, they need to establish a career. To expect those who have no economic foundation to provide free consultations and medicine is beyond even Jesus' ability! They need to use gold bars to secure housing, they need to use currency units of ten thousand to support their families, if the income is not in the tens of thousands, how can they make ends meet?

As for friends with limited financial resources, there is no need to imitate the well-to-do and consult those private doctors. Public hospitals are established by the government, open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day, day and night, waiting for patients to come. The registration fee is "at most" in the thousands. But how many people prefer to abandon the cheap for the expensive? It's hard to imagine. If you say public hospitals are not good, the most famous doctors all come from public hospitals. And now they may still hold part-time positions in public hospitals. But that's the way people are, what more can be said! When diagnosing illnesses, doctors are often asked, "Doctor, where is your office? How can I come to your clinic for a consultation next time?" This bad habit of "going through the back door" has become a national characteristic. It's as if diagnosing illnesses at a doctor's home is far more detailed than in a hospital. Not wanting to wait in line, wanting to jump the queue, wanting to use connections, this is the style of the rich, but even those without money want to follow suit, aren't they just asking for trouble!

It's strange that "honest people" are always more easily bullied. There are so many unscrupulous merchants speculating, thieves robbing, and other events that disrupt society, but the criticism of them is far less severe than a small incident involving a doctor or a hospital. Regardless of whether the truth of this small matter has been clarified, do you know that the police can simply go to the hospital to arrest nurses and doctors based on the patient's complaint? Do you know that people threaten to advertise in the newspaper to force the hospital to pay millions in "honorarium" as "compensation"? When the hospital announces that it is "full" and asks patients to seek treatment elsewhere, someone will criticize it for "failing to save those in distress," but when a refugee asks a store for a bowl of rice or a hostel for a place to stay and is cursed, who will speak up for them in the name of justice? There are only patients who get free hospitalization and reduced discharge fees, but there are no guests who get free meals and free accommodation? Unless they are "friends with accounts" who "eat from all directions"! Charity, charity, charity has ruined hospitals. No one is willing to charitably donate a sum of money for the hospital's operating expenses and set up free hospital beds, but there are calls everywhere for the hospital to squeeze out oil and do good deeds for free. From the tea boy to the doctor, the hospital has to give them a salary, which, although it can only be used as personal snacks and pocket money, the total amount is a huge expense. Since ancient times, I'm afraid there has never been an article that has called for hospitals and doctors: Please, philanthropists, let out an apartment to serve as a free dormitory for medical staff, please, laundries, do free laundry for the hospital's sheets and clothes, please, catering services, provide free meals for patients, please, pharmacies, provide free medicines for patients, please, large companies, donate a large number of sheets, clothing materials, to the hospital, please……… Yet they insist that the hospital admit patients for free.

Let's talk about doctors, please visit a hospital. Is their food nutritious enough? Is their dormitory even worse than a student's? How is their clothing? Can their salary, in addition to barely being able to support themselves, also make another new set of clothes, and raise a family? They are enduring hardships, working hard, year after year, for the future, but if you think about it for them, what is their future? You advise them to do business, yes, the doctors who really have money, their assets are probably not only from patients!

Speaking of patients, those who groan when they are not sick pay too much attention to advertising, want to get booster shots, want to take tonics, the more expensive the better. Doctors who charge gold bars or in U.S. dollars are the most appreciated. But those who are as poor as the doctors in public hospitals, also want to learn to be fashionable, do not pay attention to the training of their own physique, just want to rely on "makeup and rouge to paint the door", they are really asking for trouble.

While hating private doctors for charging high fees, I advise you to love and encourage the development of public hospitals. Let the doctors in public hospitals have enough to support their families, and give them an environment for academic research and exploration, then the people's enjoyment of free medical treatment will have a factual guarantee. Otherwise, there will not be a decent hospital in China, on the contrary, all will be seen as private doctors who are ripping people off. Don't you see that those big medical officials who shout the loudest for "public medical system" are now doing their private practice in silence?

Guiding Soldiers to Enjoy Training

I saw a column in the Readers' Opinions section of your newspaper on October 29 entitled "Please Officers Love Soldiers." I was a little incredulous after reading it. I couldn't believe that there were such unreasonable officers. I am fortunate that I can get a wise supervisor and enjoy the warmth of family love like parents and elder brothers.

I am a Private First Class in the Nanjing First Clothing Supply Depot of the United Logistics Command Headquarters. Since I enlisted, I have been trained by the squad leader every day. We started to feel it was very hard, but over time, we got used to it. Every morning, the chief officer leads all officers and soldiers in raising the flag and eating meals. A meal committee is organized by twenty-seven officers, who take turns purchasing food every day and then personally supervise the cooks in cooking. The officers and soldiers are treated equally with regard to food. If office supplies are to be purchased, the consumer cooperative makes the purchases. The empty space in the back garden is used as a farm to grow vegetables and flowers. The large courtyard in front is arranged as a Zhongshan Hall, which has a library, a chess area, a radio, a bulletin board, and a table tennis table. After meals and during leisure time, you can play games at will, so we don't want to go out to watch movies or visit the Confucius Temple. Every week, the chief officer leads a weekly meeting, and the section chiefs take turns giving speeches, so we understand the Three Principles of the People and how to love the country and the people. Our General Affairs Section Chief is a Beijinger, he manages us very strictly, does not allow us to go out casually, does not allow us to spend money indiscriminately. If we commit a mistake, we will be reprimanded or punished with kneeling or military discipline. We are very afraid of him, and everyone hates him a little, but he himself is very respectful to the warehouse chief, and does not have any private abuses in his work. We think he loves us very much, he is really like our strict father. As for our warehouse chief, he is a taciturn young man from Sichuan. His home is more than ten miles away from the warehouse, but he always arrives at the warehouse before 7 o'clock, and he walks. He has a dark face and wears very simple clothes, and he is kind from morning to night. He sits in the warehouse chief's office to do his work, never leaving, until after 6 pm before going home. He treats us like family, he is simply our kind mother, we really treat the warehouse as our home. If every officer can be like our officers, I don't think there will be any more notions of belittling soldiers. Everything I have reported above is not bragging to our officers, you can come and investigate on the spot. I hope that after the announcement, many officers with hearts of iron will see it, and let them know that they are ashamed, to see, to learn and improve. (Wu Guixian)

Another Tenant's Cry

I live in a front building of a store near Shanzhong Road. The second landlord of this house used to raise the rent once every three or four months. In February of this year, it had risen to 5,000 yuan. Electricity and water bills were still to be shared, but in September, the second landlord refused to accept the rent, claiming that the main landlord wanted to raise the rent. On November 1, the second landlord came and said that the rent would be raised five and a half times from August, a mere front building would cost 27,500 yuan, which is a shocking thing to hear. Arguing with him, he ignores it, and says that whatever the main landlord wants to add, he has to add. If you don't add it, you have to move. Is it true that the rent has to be raised every three or four months? Relying on the black heart of the second landlord to increase the rent, let him manipulate it and take heavy profits secretly, isn't there really any law to restrain it? The most oppressed are the salaried class, whose lives are barely enough to maintain, and the addition of snow on top of snow, heavy oppression, makes it hard to breathe. I hope that the relevant authorities will strictly prohibit the arbitrary increase of rent, and make regulations to inform them, so as not to encourage bad habits. (Wen Bin)

### Postal Substitute

Gu Chun Jun: Regarding the matter you presented in your letter concerning conscription deferment, we have recently received a reply from the Jinshan County Government stating: "Upon investigation, this county received an order from the province on October 7th to allocate a conscription quota of 140 men, requiring half to be conscripted before October 15th and the entire quota to be filled by the end of the month. This concerns important matters of national defense and governance and must be strictly adhered to. However, considering the urgency of the deadline, we immediately convened a military service meeting with party, government, military, and group organizations, as well as the council. Following Item 9 of the fourth section of the provincial temporary conscription implementation methods, which stipulates drawing lots for examination by the districts, townships, and pao based on twice the allocated quota, it was decided that the conscripts in this county are generally weak in physique and many meet the conditions for exemption or deferment. With 343 pao in the entire county, collecting one person from each pao, selecting the weak and retaining the strong, and verifying exemption or deferment is a more efficient and fair method. The government implemented this proposal to further perfect all lottery procedures and the supervision and review of applications for exemption or deferment, thereby preventing the malpractice of township and pao chiefs being surrounded by favors and requests beforehand. Readers of your newspaper suspect that the changes in application procedures are due to changes in laws, which is a misunderstanding. Currently, 284 conscripts from various districts have been sent to the collection station. After open examination by party groups, the council, the health institute, and other organizations, 55 men were found to be physically unfit, and 79 men met the conditions for applying for exemption, all of whom were taken back by their original district chiefs in an orderly manner without any unexpected circumstances." Specially replied.

### Republicans Decide to Cooperate with Democrats; US Foreign Policy Remains Unchanged; Labor and Agriculture Policies to be Greatly Affected Domestically

[Our News] San Francisco, 7th (Broadcast): President Truman believes that the results of this congressional election will not have a significant impact on the government's foreign policy, as this point is not a matter of contention between the two parties.

[Our News] San Francisco, 7th (Broadcast): Experienced political observers believe that when the Republican 80th Congress convenes in January next year, it will maintain and even strengthen MacArthur's position in Japan, Marshall's peace efforts in China, and adopt a firm stance towards the Soviet Union in Korea, China's Northeast Provinces, and Europe.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 7th (Special Dispatch)] Republican leaders here, after achieving an overwhelming victory in yesterday's national election, today assured that they will cooperate loyally with Truman and Democratic officials in the government on political affairs. The Republicans stated: Cooperation is a two-way street, and they expect Democrats managing political affairs to place the welfare of the country above partisan interests and follow the will of the people, as they expressed during the election.

[French News Agency, Washington, 7th] Reece, Chairman of the Republican Central Committee, spoke about the party's foreign policy today, stating: When the next Republican Congress convenes, it will demonstrate to the world the determination of the United States to remain strong, but only if the Republicans can ensure the cooperation of the current Democratic government. The Republicans want to cooperate with other countries, but the party is determined to maintain America's traditions and defend its interests at all costs. In many parts of the world today, the freedom of most people is widely violated. At this time, the American people have turned to the Republican Party, which is truly liberal, and this is admirable.

[French News Agency, New York, 6th] Republican leader Vandenberg has been elected Senator for the fourth time in Michigan. It is said that the Republican victory is a sign of national support for a joint bipartisan foreign policy. From now on, the responsibilities of Republican senators are heavier and they must strive to fulfill them.

[United Press, Washington, 6th] With the Republican victory in the election, Senator Vandenberg is likely to become the Speaker of the Senate, succeeding the current Democratic Speaker, McCormack. The chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, currently held by Democratic Senator Connally, will also be taken over by Vandenberg. Many observers predict that Senate Majority Leader, Democratic Senator Barkley, will be replaced by Republican Senator Taft, who will also serve as Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. However, other observers believe that Taft would prefer to chair the Joint Committee.

[United Press, Washington, 6th] The Republican election victory will affect American labor and agricultural policies. According to Republican Congressman Martin of Massachusetts today, the Republicans will discuss more effective ways to restore harmonious relations between labor and management based on principles of absolute fairness. Martin, who may become Speaker of the House, has attracted attention from all sides of America. The Republicans have stated that they will vigorously oppose any control or subsidy measures and advocate for finding ways to expand the market. The party may introduce legislation related to expanding the market for agricultural crops.

Post-US Election Power Shift; Relationship with Soviet Union to Become Delicate

[United Press, New York, 6th] Diplomats at the United Nations General Assembly believe that the Republican election victory could have at least three impacts on US foreign policy: (1) Vandenberg will be a key figure in the Four Foreign Ministers Conference and the US delegation to the United Nations General Assembly. (2) Although the current national foreign policy is a bipartisan policy of Democrats and Republicans, the Republicans, having an absolute majority in Congress, can do whatever they want with foreign policy measures, so it is difficult to predict how it will develop in the future. (3) The power shift in the United States will at least temporarily put US-Soviet relations in a delicate stage. A diplomat who once represented a Western country as an envoy to Moscow said today: "The results of this election in the United States do not seem to have much significance in Moscow. Since Vandenberg joined the US delegation to the United Nations, the Soviet Union has long understood that the United States only has one foreign policy, and it will proceed along a straight line thereafter."

Senator Fulbright Says Truman Should Resign Immediately

[Reuters, Washington, 7th] President Truman, accompanied by his wife and daughter, refused to express his opinion on the election results to reporters while returning to Washington by special train from his hometown in Missouri, saying he would host reporters for a talk in a day or two.

[Reuters, New York, 6th] Republican Senator Fulbright said after the Republican election victory that Truman should appoint a Republican as Secretary of State today, and he himself should resign as President. After Truman resigns, the Secretary of State will succeed to the presidency. He is not asking Truman to resign, but feels that this is the best thing for him. According to the US Constitution, if the President dies, the successors in order should be the Vice President, the Secretary of State, and the Secretary of the Treasury.

Reenactment of the Wilson Era; Congressional and White House Positions in Opposition

[United Press, New York, 6th] Since the Republicans have greatly defeated the Democrats in the election battle, the US government is bound to undergo major changes. The Republican platform allows for a 2% reduction in individual income tax in the 1947 national budget, and government spending will be saved by one trillion dollars to balance the budget; the President's wartime powers will also be reduced, and the shortage of foods such as sugar will be investigated. The people of the country are bound to be happy to accept the Republican campaign promises regarding the control of goods. The votes obtained by the party swept from Massachusetts to California, and even the southern states, traditionally Democratic strongholds, were affected. The number of votes being checked in various places, obtained by the Republicans, is still increasing with time. When the new Congress convenes in January next year, it will be politically opposed to the White House, reenacting the situation during President Wilson's era after World War I; however, according to US political examples, the Republicans are expected to enter the White House in two years.

Have You Had Enough? The Republican Campaign Slogan

[French News Agency, Washington, 7th] The Republican victory in this election has gimmicks that the Democrats cannot match. The slogan revealed by the Republicans in various election districts is: "Have you had enough? Then vote Republican!" What the Republicans mean by "enough" is enough strikes, enough price increases, enough difficulty in supply, and especially enough threat from the Communists. Observers believe that the last point accounts for half of the Republican victory.

### Hoover and Wallace Each Issue Commentary

Glimpses of British, French, and Soviet Opinion

[Reuters, New York, 6th] Former Republican President Hoover commented on the Republican victory, saying: The entire world, including the United States, has been leaning towards the path of leftist authoritarian economics for several years. After this election, the United States is the first country to rise up against this force. Former Secretary of Commerce Wallace said: A House of Representatives controlled by the Republicans will increase our country's economic problems, and progressive Americans will have to seek help from leaders of free thought. After this election, the Democratic Party must either become more progressive or declare its death. I sincerely do not want to see the Democratic Party die.

[Our News] London, 7th (Broadcast): The Soviet "Pravda" commented on the US Republican election victory, saying: The reactionaries in the United States are wasting the political capital painstakingly accumulated by President Roosevelt. This election particularly proves that the current US foreign policy is actually the foreign policy of the Republican Party.

[United Press, London, 6th] Today, London newspapers all announced the results of the US election with large headlines, saying "The United States has leaned extremely to the right." French newspapers used headlines such as "Truman's opposition triumphs" and "The American people distrust Truman." The London Evening News said: The United States has dramatically turned to the right at a time when the world is leaning more to the left.

### Impact of General Election: New York Stocks Plummet

[Reuters, New York, 6th] Judging from the number of votes obtained by Republican leaders, the most promising candidates for the next presidential election are, in order, New York Governor Dewey, Ohio Senator Bricker, and California Governor Warren. Supporters of the Republican Party all believe that after this election, right-wing elements have been revived in a left-leaning world. The Truman government will form a more acute opposition to Congress than before, and the rise of the right will completely abolish various economic controls, restoring the "laissez-faire" era for large enterprises. Many important stocks on the New York stock market plummeted this morning.

### Foreign Ministers Conference: Italy and South Submit Statements

[United Press, New York, 6th] South Korean Foreign Minister Simic and the Italian representative attended the Foreign Ministers Conference today to present their opinions on the Trieste issue. Simic made two limited concessions: (1) The eastern border line that South Korea can accept can be moved further east than originally agreed. (2) The requirement that the Governor of Trieste must be a South Korean national is revoked.

### Soviet Revolution Commemoration: Grand Military Parade in Red Square; Stalin Does Not Attend Celebration Ceremony; Zhdanov Defends Foreign Policy

[French News Agency, Moscow, 7th] Today is the 29th anniversary of the Soviet Union's National Day. A large-scale military parade was held in Red Square, with infantry, artillery units, tank units, and "Stalin" style giant tanks participating. A grand celebration ceremony was held at the Moscow Grand Theater last night, but Head of State Stalin did not attend.

[United Press, London, 7th] Soviet radio broadcast the celebration, but did not specify whether Stalin was present to participate in the celebration. The London Times speculated today that Stalin "may be following the doctor's advice" and not giving a speech.

[Reuters, London, 6th] Moscow Radio said: At a meeting of the Moscow Soviet today, Zhdanov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Zhdanov is regarded as Stalin's successor), attended and delivered a speech defending the Soviet Union's foreign policy and accusing Britain and the United States of preventing the implementation of peace plans. He said that the Soviet Union, the center of the world's democratic forces, has become the target of a propaganda offensive by those who make war a profitable business and fear the growth of democratic forces. One of the Soviet Union's goals is to establish a strong United Nations organization to prevent aggression and maintain peace. The Soviet Union is constantly striving to establish a strong, lasting, and reasonable democratic peace. Zhdanov first mentioned the domestic situation in his speech, saying that the Soviet Union remained strong after the war, and the Soviet Union was probably the only country where no crisis occurred after the war.

### Truman's Congratulatory Telegram

[United Press, London, 7th] Moscow Radio said that US President Truman sent a telegram to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, congratulating Svinik on the Soviet Revolution anniversary.

### Stalin Issues Hand Order: Peace Cannot Forget War

Stalin ordered all Soviet troops to learn military technology. Although the hand order was issued by Minister of Defense Stalin, it was signed by Deputy Minister Bulganin.

### US Decides to Retain Administrative Rights Over Pacific Islands; Plans to Submit Draft Trusteeship Agreement to Security Council for Discussion

[United Press, Washington, 6th] President Truman announced today that the United States is prepared to transfer all of the former Japanese territories and its mandated islands that the United States now controls to the United Nations for trusteeship, and the United States only needs to retain its administrative rights. The United States has also drafted "Strategic Area" trusteeship agreements for the Marshall, Caroline, and Mariana Islands, which can be submitted to the United Nations Security Council for discussion. These draft agreements have also been sent to the other ten members of the Security Council and New Zealand and the Philippines for research. As for the islands that originally belonged to Japan but were not mandated by the League of Nations, the United States does not seem to have drafted trusteeship agreements yet. These islands include the Ogasawara Islands, the Volcano Islands, and the Ryukyu Peninsula, but the President's statement implies that they should also be drafted in the future. Government officials familiar with the United Nations Charter call the phrase "Strategic Area" the key to the President's statement. According to the United Nations Charter, all matters related to trusteeship of strategic areas should be handled by the Security Council, while non-strategic areas are handled by the United Nations Trusteeship Council.

Full Text of the Agreement Draft

[US News Agency, Washington, 6th] The State Department today issued a draft of the trusteeship agreement for the Japanese mandated islands. The draft agreement quotes the provisions of the United Nations Charter, stipulating the establishment of an international trusteeship system to manage and supervise certain territories, including territories under the current mandated system of various countries. The draft also states that the League of Nations Council on December 17, 1920, charged Japan with mandating the former German islands north of the equator, and as a result of World War II, Japan has ceased to exercise any powers over these islands. Therefore, after the United Nations Security Council believes that there is no incompatibility with the relevant provisions of the Charter, it decides to pass the following trusteeship conditions for these Pacific islands:

(Article 1) Stipulates that these islands are designated as strategically important areas and placed under the United Nations trusteeship system. The draft agreement refers to the area as the trusteeship territory thereafter. (Article 2) The United States "is designated as the administrative management office of the trusteeship territory." (Article 3) The United States' administrative, legislative, and jurisdictional powers over the trusteeship territory are restricted by the provisions of the agreement. (Article 4) The administrative management office must abide by the principles of the United Nations trusteeship system. (Article 5) The administrative management office must protect the trusteeship territory and contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security in accordance with the United Nations Charter. In order to achieve this goal, the administrative management office may (a) build naval, land, and air bases and build fortresses in the trusteeship territory, (b) verify the tie-up and mobilize armed forces in the territory, and (c) use volunteers, equipment, and assistance in the trusteeship territory in order to not only maintain the local defense, law, and order in the trusteeship territory, but also perform the obligations of the administrative management office to the Security Council. (Article 6) Explains how the administrative management office fulfills its obligations under Article 76 (b) of the United Nations Charter, including: promoting the development of residents in the territory towards autonomy, promoting the economic progress and self-sufficiency of residents, and promoting their social and cultural progress. (Article 7) Stipulates guarantees for the following freedoms for residents: freedom of speech, press, assembly, conscience, worship, religion, education, and immigration and migration. (Article 8) The administrative management office shall guarantee equal treatment for all member countries of the United Nations and their people in the areas of judicial administration and negotiating commercial treaties and other agreements within its mandated territory. Section 3 of this article states, "The provisions of this article shall not be interpreted as such for the issue of aviation rights for aircraft entering and leaving the trusteeship area. This right is a matter for the authorities in charge of the trusteeship area to subscribe to an agreement with the country to which the aircraft belongs." (Article 10) Allows the administrative management authority to participate in any regional advisory committee, regional authority, or technical organization or other national self-established association, and also allows it to participate in the specified international organizations. (Article 11) Stipulates that the United States should take steps to determine the nationality status of residents of the trusteeship land. (Article 12) The United States shall establish a law to implement this agreement within the trusteeship territory. (Article 13) Articles 87 and 88 of the United Nations Charter apply to the trusteeship land. (Article 14) The administrative management office shall abide by the provisions of any appropriate international conference and recommendations within the trusteeship land. (Article 15) Prohibits the unauthorized alteration, modification, or abolition of the provisions of the agreement without the consent of the United States. (Article 16) This agreement will take effect after completing the procedure specified in the Charter and being approved by the Security Council and the US government.

### Shanghai Book Industry Delegation to Petition in Beijing Today; Permanently Exempt from Business Tax

Request for Prompt Approval of City Council Resolution

Yesterday, 268 bookstores in this city, including Commercial Press, Chung Hwa Book Co., Zhengzhong, World, Da Dong, Kaiming, Children's Bookstore, Yongxiang, Guangyi, Wentong, Guangming, Shenghuo, Writers', Longmen, Baixin, Jinzhang, and Huiwentang, gathered at the Book Industry Association and unanimously agreed that the book industry is a cultural undertaking closely related to the nation's destiny and the survival of the people, and should be strongly supported by the government. Previously, in September of this year, the city council publicly resolved at its first general meeting to exempt the book industry from business tax, intending to revitalize culture after the war and provide support. However, this resolution to exempt the book industry from business tax must be approved by the Ministry of Finance to take effect. Now, more than a month has passed, and there is still no clear written statement from the Ministry of Finance, which has caused deep consternation. Accordingly, it was publicly recommended that representative Guo Nongshan, Wang Jiugu, Fan Xiren, Shen Jixiang, Lu Shizhong, Xu Xiaoyun, Yao Pengzi, Xu Boxin, Liu Jikang, Song Liangrui, Zhang Shimin, Xu Shaohe, Li Changsheng, Zhou Xihe, Wang Zhicheng, Jiang Zhenzhan, and Wang Qiuquan, a total of seventeen people, together with Li Bojia, chairman of the Book Industry Association, take a China National Aviation Corporation flight to Beijing at 8 am today to petition, personally presenting the details to the Ministry of Finance, requesting prompt approval of the city council resolution, permanently exempting the book industry from business tax, in order to implement the state's intention to support culture and thereby increase the efficiency of universal education.

Another report: The Shanghai book industry delegation will travel to Beijing this time to personally submit a petition to Minister Yu Hongjun of the Ministry of Finance, stating various reasons, requesting permanent exemption from business tax for the book industry, and will also petition President Song of the Executive Yuan, Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education, and Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, so that the case of exempting the book industry from business tax, which is related to the future of the nation and its culture, is of great importance, and should be given strong support.

### Labor Circles Launch Organization: National Federation of Trade Unions

In view of the fact that the National General Chamber of Commerce already has an organization in the form of a federation, the Shanghai General Labor Union recognizes that now is the time when the nation is focusing its efforts on industrial development, promoting production, and maximizing labor efficiency.

It is learned that the union has received replies from Changchun, Fuzhou, Nanchang, ____ County, Huaimi, Taoyuan, Wuxi, Wu County, Changshu, Nanhui, and other counties, expressing their support and suggesting that the government should explicitly stipulate the organizational law of the national federation of trade unions when revising labor laws and regulations in order to facilitate its establishment.

### Zizha-Lianjia Vessel Changes Arrival Date to the 9th

European Ship Passengers Stranded in Singapore

[Our Newspaper] The Zizha-Lianjia vessel of the Java Company will now arrive in Shanghai on the 9th, carrying more than 500 passengers, most of whom boarded in Hong Kong.

### Shandong Refugees Urgently Need Relief: Minister Gu Discusses the Disaster Situation at the Shandong Fellow Villagers Welcome Meeting

The Shandong Province Refugee Relief Association held a grand welcome meeting at the Shandong Fellow Villagers Association on Luban Road at 3 p.m. yesterday to welcome Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang, and to urge Minister Gu to report on the inspection of the disaster area in Shandong and relief measures, as well as to promote relief for the disaster in Shandong. The heads of various agencies in the city were invited to participate, including Kong Xiangxi, Gu Zhenggang, Qin Dechun, Zhang Jingyu, Xuan Tiewu, Wang Guanqing, and more than 200 members of the fellow villagers association. The meeting was chaired by Qin Dechun, Vice President of the Association. Mr. Qin first expressed his welcome to Minister Gu, and then expressed his gratitude to Mr. Gu for providing practical and effective relief to the disaster victims in Shandong Province after inspecting the disaster situation in Shandong Province in mid-August. At the same time, he asked the heads of various agencies and leaders from all walks of life in Shanghai to assist in launching relief efforts for the disaster in Shandong. Minister Gu then reported on the inspection of the disaster area in Shandong and the relief methods, briefly stating: "I will do my best to cooperate with everyone to find ways to launch practical relief work for the Shandong refugees who are still in deep water and fire." The Shandong relief and rehabilitation affairs were originally handled by the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. In August, the Central Government ordered me to inspect Shandong, and I went to Qingdao, Jinan, Zhoucun, Zichuan, Boshan and other places. There are about 3 million people who need relief. According to the report of the Shandong-Qingdao Branch of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, 1.2 million people are in need of relief, and they were originally farmers, workers, and educated youth with assets or means of production. Now they have all become refugees and urgently need relief. Most of the students in Jinan eat coarse steamed buns, salted radishes, and plain boiled water. They are ragged and barefoot everywhere. Farmers and workers are forced to leave peaceful places, which is even more miserable. This is all due to the devastation of the enemy during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War and the actions of the Communist Party in the past year. After the inspection, I reported the actual situation to the Central Government, and at the same time, I had several thoughts: (1) The Shandong refugees have suffered all kinds of hardships and are in great pain. I extend my greatest sympathy to them. (2) The spirit of hard work and perseverance of the Shandong compatriots is worthy of admiration. (3) The land in Shandong is fertile and rich in products. It was the base of the Anti-Japanese War in the past, and it will be the base of national construction in the future. "The Shandong authorities proposed that the Central Government allocate 2 billion yuan in relief funds. After the Central Government approved 1 billion yuan, it also made several decisions: (1) Small loans of 500 million yuan. (2) Agricultural loans of 1 billion yuan. (3) Industrial loans are being negotiated. (4) 500,000 sets of winter clothing. (5) 3,000 to 4,000 tons of flour, with each refugee receiving about one bag of flour. The government has done its best to allocate such relief funds and materials in the midst of financial difficulties. Recently, the Central Government will conduct a second relief effort. The emergency relief in the pacification zone will be handled by the Ministry of Social Affairs. 300 counties in the pacification zone have been occupied, and 120 counties have been recovered. About 2 million people are in urgent need of relief. The Central Government plans to allocate 9 billion yuan, plus 20,000 tons of flour. Each county will receive about 50 million yuan in relief funds and 8,000 bags of flour, plus 500,000 sets of clothing and 500,000 catties of food____ to be distributed in a coordinated manner. In addition, the Farmers Bank will also provide small loans. The Central Government also subsidizes the local administrative expenses in the recovered areas, setting it at 600,000 yuan per county per month to reduce the burden on the people. I will soon go to various parts of the north to inspect, convey the intentions of the Central Government, and comfort the refugees." Finally, Mr. Gu asked all sectors to launch a disaster relief campaign, help each other, and promote the great spirit of the Chinese nation. Then, Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu delivered a speech, praising the contributions of Shandong generals Wang Yaowu, Li Yannian, and the late General Zhang Zizhong to the country during the Anti-Japanese War. He expressed his willingness to participate in promoting relief for the disaster in Shandong. Then, Mayor Wu's representative Wang Guanqing delivered a speech, expressing his willingness to call for disaster relief. Later, Central Committee member Kong Xiangxi delivered a speech, urging people in Shanghai to save money from eating meat to help the disaster in Shandong, so that the Shandong refugees in deep water and fire can eat some miscellaneous grains. At the same time, he asked the Shandong Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai to take the lead in donating as an initiative. Finally, the disaster relief methods were discussed, and it was first decided to raise relief funds ranging from 500 million to 1 billion yuan.

### A Beautiful Moon and Blooming Flowers: Chrysanthemum Exhibition to be Held at Fuxing Park Starting Today

[Special Feature from Our Newspaper] "Picking chrysanthemums under the eastern fence, I leisurely see the southern mountains." Tao Yuanming's obsession with chrysanthemums in ancient times was originally a good story in history. But for two thousand years, how could Tao Yuanming be the only one in the country who loves chrysanthemums? As the saying goes, "Even when the chrysanthemums are gone, there are still proud frost-resistant branches," how many people have yearned for the noble character of chrysanthemums!

Following the Huang Garden Chrysanthemum Exhibition, the Garden and Field Management Office of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works will hold a large-scale chrysanthemum exhibition at Fuxing Park starting today. The chrysanthemums displayed in the park, large and small, in various shapes and colors, number no less than 3,000 pots. Stepping into the gate of Fuxing Park, a myriad of colorful flowers will immediately dazzle you and be a feast for the eyes.

Entering from the gate on Huailong Road, the first thing that catches your eye is the large lawn with the two characters "菊展" (Chrysanthemum Exhibition) written on it. The characters are in a straight font, made up of snow-blue tiny chrysanthemums called "Baby's Breath".

The Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth

Turning your gaze from the two characters "菊展" to the left, the national emblem of the "Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth" appears before you. This three-dimensional national emblem is also composed of tiny chrysanthemums called "Baby's Breath". It is eighteen feet high. The top of the highest conical layer, the "White Sun," is made of white chrysanthemums, and the twelve "corners" distributed around it are also composed of small white chrysanthemums. The bottom layer is the "Wholly Red Earth," which is composed of dozens of pots of red chrysanthemums. With a large expanse of green grass as a foil, what a beautiful emblem of the motherland with the "Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth"! It is said that these ingenious masterpieces were all designed by horticultural expert Mr. Cheng Shifu.

The Panda Still Looking Spirited: Feet on the Green Grass, Red Carrot in Mouth

In addition, it is quite interesting to see the remains of the panda group displayed in a glass cage. Its feet are on the green grass, and it has a red carrot in its mouth. Its snow-white fur has turned yellow because it has been frozen below zero degrees for too long. The eyes are still so bright, shining brightly at every visiting tourist. Is it a look of arrogance? Or a full of anger?

In addition to the more than 1,000 pots of chrysanthemums carefully cultivated by various nurseries, there are also participants from various local areas, such as Huang Garden, Xian Garden, Nanyang Seed Company, Xiangshun Company, Guo Yongping, Xue Haonan, Gao Lianshi, etc., totaling more than 30 units. There are more than 1,000 pots of various types of chrysanthemums. The names alone, which are rich in poetic meaning, are already a feast for the eyes. Such as "Guifei Drunk," "Chang'e Flying to the Moon," "Golden Hook Supporting the Moon," "Ice Plate Holding Cinnamon," "Golden Xi Bamboo," "The Former Dynasty Remains"...

According to Xu Tianxi, Director of the Garden and Field Management Office, and Cheng Shifu, a horticultural expert: foreigners and Chinese have different standards for loving chrysanthemums. European and American countries like to use chrysanthemums for flower arrangements and planting in flower beds, and rarely grow them in pots. Therefore, they only pay attention to the flowers, diameter, and color. As a result, they often like the tiny chrysanthemums called "Baby's Breath" of Japanese origin. However, the Chinese appreciate chrysanthemums for their graceful posture, the dancing of delicate petals, or for their unusual colors, such as soy sauce color, green, and dark purple, which are all considered to be precious.

The responsible persons in the Garden and Field Management Office have worked hard for three days and three nights, and finally added a touch of beauty to this ugly world. - Do you say that you do not love flowers? Do you have no special affection for high-class chrysanthemums? I advise you to go to the chrysanthemum exhibition for a visit! Discovering a little beauty in this ugly world is also a touch of comfort in the midst of a hundred sorrows!

### Mayor Inspects Labor District: Residents of Yaoshui Lane and Yinghua Lane in District Thirteen are Mixed, and Criminals Regard it as a Refuge

[Our Newspaper] Mayor Wu, accompanied by Zhang Xiaosong, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, inspected Districts Twelve and Thirteen at 8 a.m. yesterday, inquiring in detail about the summary tables of household registration and the movement registers, and diligently asking about the increase and decrease of the population. He did not return to the city government until 9:30 a.m.

According to Mayor Wu, he hopes to revisit the districts in the near future. Next time, he may visit the Xincheng District and the Huangpu District. He will personally inspect places with dense populations and cramped conditions so that he can learn about the real situation of life at the lower levels.

After the mayor left, the reporter further inquired about the general situation of the two districts. Both districts are labor districts with special circumstances, which are recorded separately below:

District Twelve Raises Funds for School: May Reach 300 Million Yuan

(1) The head of District Twelve is Hou __ren, and the deputy head is Lü Xingcheng. The office is located in the Gordon Road Police Sub-bureau and at No. 12 Zhonghua Xincun, Xinzha Road, the former residence of Zhou Nigang Jun. The district has 51 bao (neighborhoods), 36,000 households, and 210,000 people, including approximately 120,000 men and 90,000 women. The district is actively carrying out the establishment of national education classes, and 40 classes have been established, with 80 people in each class. The fundraising for the ____ school has also been promoted, and it is estimated that 150 million to 300 million yuan can be raised (mostly from donations from factory owners). The biggest problem currently facing the district is the lack of a fixed office location. Therefore, during the mayor's inspection, a petition was submitted, stating: "The office and staff dormitories of this office do not yet have a fixed address, and the staff are running around, which has a great impact on their work. It has been found that a building at No. 40 Sanyuanfang, Xinzha Road, the residence of the traitor Zhang Guisheng, has been sealed up by the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau. It is requested to be temporarily allocated."

Out-of-School Children Account for 60%

(2) The head of District Thirteen is Zheng Meikui. The district has 34 bao (neighborhoods), 833 tian (fields), and a population of 131,775 people, including 73,132 men and 58,273 women. The district also has water-based baojia (neighborhood security system). The number of out-of-school children reaches 60%. National literacy classes are currently being promoted, and 300 million yuan has been raised for school celebrations. Once a school site is found, a central primary school will be planned. There is another thing worth mentioning: the area of Yaoshui Lane and Yinghua Lane in the district has a mixed population, and those who have committed crimes see it as a refuge. Therefore, it was known as "Little Liangshan" in the past. However, after rectification, it has changed its old appearance. It is said that most of the residents of the two districts are workers. Although they can obtain ____ cooperation when promoting district work, the rate of ____ is inevitably slow due to the low level of knowledge.

### Three Russian Criminals Arrested for Specializing in Stealing Jeeps: Stole Vehicles Parked on the Roadside and Sold Them Near the Grand Guangming Theater

(Our Newspaper) Recently, auto theft cases have occurred frequently in the city. Although the police authorities have repeatedly arrested thieves and brought them to justice, they have not been able to completely eliminate them. The Dangsu Sub-bureau received a tip-off on the 28th of last month, saying that a car thief named Ivanoff, a Russian, lived at No. 2423 Bailinan Road. Chief Zhao of the bureau ordered Section Chief Wang Duanhong to lead officers __ Dacheng, cadres Zhu Huanzhang and Zhang Yuyao to rush to the location at around 5 a.m. the next morning to arrest him.

According to his confession, he is 27 years old and works as a driver. He also claimed that (1) One month ago, at about 12 o'clock one night, he was in a bar on Huanlong Road with his friend Chaihalov and others. He caught sight of a U.S. ambulance parked on the side of the road. Seeing that no one was around, they drove it away together. After driving to Hongqiao Road, the vehicle broke down and could not be driven, so it was abandoned on the side of the road. The vehicle was later recovered by the U.S. military authorities. He claimed that this was due to being drunk and not intentional theft. (2) One month ago, he met his friend Paivalov on the road. The latter said that there was an American woman who wanted to buy a Jeep. A few days later, he introduced the American woman, Mike, to him. They met at the Didi Si Cafe on Linsen Middle Road. Mike intended to buy a Jeep for 200 U.S. dollars. A few days later, at 8 p.m. one night, he stole a Jeep in front of the Ducheng Hotel on Jiangxi Road, drove it near the Grand Guangming Theater, and a Russian sent by Mike gave him 200 U.S. dollars. Then he handed over the vehicle to him, and he drove it away. After checking the U.S. dollars, he only got 100 U.S. dollars. (3) A week later, he met Mike again on Linsen Road. The latter asked him to sell another Jeep and promised to meet again at Didi Si in three days. After meeting, they agreed to deliver the goods near the Grand Guangming Theater that night. When he arrived at the scene, he met a Russian named Xiyeaifu, who gave him 200 U.S. dollars. He had just stolen a vehicle from the entrance of the Arcadia Nightclub and handed it over to Xiyeaifu to drive away. The two Jeeps were one for the U.S. Army and one for the U.S. Navy, etc. According to the confession, the original investigator went to the address to arrest Paivalov and Xiyelov, etc., who have all admitted to selling the stolen goods. However, the American woman Mike has returned to the United States recently, and all the stolen vehicles cannot be recovered. The three Russian criminals will be transferred to the District Procuratorate for verification and handling this morning.

### No One Has Applied to Register for the Second Round of Auctions of Houses in Various Alleys

Who Wants to Make Trouble for Themselves in This Day and Age?

Since the Central Trust Bureau announced the second round of auctions for 333 real estate properties, all tenants in the Weihai Villa on Weihaiwei Road, the Daxingli in Wusong Road, and the Gongheli in Changzhi Road, which were listed for auction, have published advertisements unanimously opposing the auction and demanding the protection of the legal tenants' right to continue leasing. According to Article 425 of the Civil Code: "After the lessor delivers the leased property, even if he transfers the ownership to a third party, the lease contract continues to exist for the transferee." However, Item 11 in the Central Trust Bureau's "Instructions for Voting on the Auction of Enemy and Puppet Real Estate" stipulates: "All enemy and puppet houses that have been auctioned must be vacated within two days after signing the preliminary agreement and handed over to the successful bidder for takeover on the day of the transaction. If the vacation is delayed, the successful bidder may apply in writing to cancel the preliminary agreement, and the Bureau will return the deposit and pay interest at a monthly rate of one cent per deposit amount." Thus, it seems that regardless of whether the lease contract is valid or not, the original residents of the houses being auctioned will be forced to move out within twenty days, causing tens of thousands of citizens to suffer the pain of displacement. Therefore, this reporter visited Chen Hanqing, the assistant manager of the Real Estate Department of the Central Trust Bureau, to inquire about the handling of the aforementioned real estate auction. According to him, 18 units have registered with the Trust Bureau since the second auction began, but most of the houses applied for purchase are single-family homes. No one has applied to register for the houses in various alleys that published advertisements in the newspapers opposing the auction. Chen admitted that the provisions in Item 11 of the "Instructions for Bidding" were too broad. The Bureau has decided to recognize the legal lease rights acquired before the victory and whose lease terms have not yet expired, and will not apply Item 11. However, according to Chen, except for the tenants of Weihai Villa, most of whom have legal lease rights, most of the households in the alleys in the Hongkou district that are being auctioned do not have legal lease relationships. As for how the original residents will be forced to vacate after the houses are auctioned, it will be handled by the Disposal Bureau, which is beyond the authority of the Central Trust Bureau. This reporter then visited Shen Guanqi, the Secretary-General of the Disposal Bureau, who said: "The Disposal Bureau's auction of houses must not conflict with the Civil Code, but for residents who have not obtained legal lease relationships or whose lease terms have expired, after the real estate is sold, the Disposal Bureau will ask the military camp agencies in the city to assist in ordering them to move out. For entire alleys such as Weihai Villa, several houses without lease rights must be vacated for the purchaser to live in, and the rest will still be subleased to the original residents with lease contracts, so the purchaser should not have any objections."

### Two Traitors in Changshu Relied on Enemy Power to Oppress the Villagers. Li Jianci and Gui Zhen Were Tried Yesterday

[Our Report] The High Court yesterday heard several cases of suspected treason: (1) Li Jianci and Gui Zhen were reported after the victory. After investigation by the 23rd Regiment of the Military Police and the Changshu County Government, it was confirmed that Li had served as a liaison officer for the puppet Changshu County Government and a translator for the enemy military police. He often used the power of the enemy to go to the countryside to collect military grain and extort rice and other items. On July 26, 1938, he led enemy military police to Xixiang Bridge to kill and burn with machine guns. The Chenghuang Temple and other places were destroyed, and many people were killed and injured. In addition, he colluded with the enemy military police to capture anti-Japanese elements. Gui Zhen served as an intelligence officer in the puppet Changshu County Special Operations Station and as a member of the Special High Group of the puppet Changshu County Police Bureau, working with Li Jianci. In court yesterday, Li admitted that he knew a little Japanese, but only served as a liaison officer in the General Affairs Section of the puppet Changshu County Government, and only indirectly helped the enemy purchase food, denying everything else. Gui claimed that it was a case of mistaken identity, not the defendant, but admitted that he had indeed served as a member of the Special High Group of the Police Bureau, but claimed that he had joined under the order of the National Salvation Army to cover up the provision of information.

Zhang Awu and Chen Lingeng

(2) Zhang Awu and Chen Lingeng, who were engaged in barge transportation, transported materials for the Xie Xing Foreign Firm and the Donghe Foreign Firm, which were run by the enemy navy on the Huangpu River during the enemy and puppet period. On the morning of August 10, 1943, villagers Ge Xingmin and Zhang Zhiliang purchased dozens of kilograms of rice from Pudong and crossed the river to Shanghai's Gongping Road for sale. Just as they reached the center of the river, they were suddenly ordered to stop by a small enemy fire transport. Zhang Awu and Chen Lingeng forcibly dragged Ge and Zhang to the transport, falsely accusing them of stealing military supplies. They were escorted to the enemy military police team and subjected to torture, and detained for 29 days before being interrogated and released. After the victory, the victims reported them. The two defendants denied the charges in court yesterday.

Wu Wenquan

(3) Wu Wenquan was accused of serving in the puppet Special Operations Headquarters No. 76 during the 30th year of the Republic of China, and later serving as a secret agent for the Penglai Road branch of the enemy Shanghai Military Police, using his power to extort money from merchants. After the victory, he was reported by others. After questioning in all the above cases, all were adjourned for further questioning.

White Russian

Moulton Lehof, has lived in Shanghai for eleven years. He is 44 years old and served as the secretary of the Shanghai White Russian Friendship Association. After the victory, he was accused of serving as an intelligence officer at the enemy military department's radio station on Jing'an Temple Road. The case has been heard several times, and the defendant has denied the charges. The debate concluded during the hearing yesterday morning, and the verdict is scheduled to be announced at 9:30 a.m. on the 14th of this month. The case of Sun Renmao, a construction worker accused of building roads for the enemy, is also scheduled to be announced on the same day.

(3) Alumni registration will begin immediately and will end at the end of this month. (4) Jiang Hao, Wang Zhesheng, and Han Cheng were publicly recommended to work at the association.

### Too Many River Police, Unclear Authority, Merchants Suffer, Not Knowing What to Do

[Our Report] According to people in the import and export industry, the situation of theft at the wharves in the city has improved slightly since the authorities have repeatedly rectified it. However, the police force on the river surface is still too thin. It is now heard that various parties are launching the organization of a voluntary water police force to supplement the police force. This organization can be realized in the shortest possible time.

It is also said that the division of authority between the port police and the water police on the river surface is quite problematic. The case has been discussed many times by the Shanghai Port Affairs Reorganization Committee, but no solution has been reached. The merchants are even more at a loss. It is hoped that the relevant authorities will pay attention to it.

The congestion of ships in the port has not been as serious as before recently. This is because the US seamen's strike has not been resolved, so there are very few US ships arriving. The situation in various docks has also become more relaxed.

### The Mission of Taiwan Company's Ships: Repatriating Japanese Nationals Remaining in Taiwan, Transporting Taiwanese Compatriots from Nanyang Back, and Simultaneously Carrying Passengers and Cargo to Shanghai

[Our Report] In addition to the ships of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Minsheng Company, the Taiwan Shipping Company also operates the Taipei and Tainan ships between Shanghai and Taiwan. According to Shen Huating, the head of the preparatory office of the company's Shanghai office, these two ships were Japanese ships salvaged and received after the victory, each with more than 8,000 tons. The biggest task at present is to transport Taiwanese compatriots from Nanyang back and repatriate Japanese nationals remaining in Taiwan. The former are laborers who were forcibly conscripted by the Japanese during the war, numbering about 40,000. They are now being transported back to Taiwan in batches by the Taipei ship. There are still more than 20,000 Japanese nationals waiting to be repatriated, who are being transported by the Tainan ship. At the same time, they are also carrying ballast cargo to Shanghai, so the route is triangular: first from Keelung to Sasebo, and after the Japanese nationals disembark, they sail to Shanghai to unload the cargo; then they load cargo and passengers from Shanghai back to Keelung. Each round trip takes about 20 days, and each trip can carry about 300 passengers. The ticket price is in accordance with the regulations of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. As for the company's other received ships, they are all small motorized sailing ships that can only sail on the island of Taiwan. New ships have now been ordered from the United States, and four of them will be delivered soon, the largest of which is about 2,000 tons.

### Chairman of the National Art Association Zhang Daofan Came to Shanghai to Recuperate, Hoping to Have a Few Days of Peace and Quiet Without Seeing Guests

Central Committee Member Zhang Daofan arrived in Shanghai by express train from Beijing at 8:00 a.m. yesterday. Zhang's wife and sons and daughters came with him. Zhang's visit was purely for recuperation, so he will not be receiving guests in Shanghai for the time being.

Answering Reporter's Questions

[Another Report] Zhang Daofan, Chairman of the China National Art Association, who recently became a student of Qi Baishi, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing at 8:00 a.m. yesterday. At the North Railway Station, Zhang supported his wife with his right hand and carried his beloved daughter Lilian out of the car with his left hand. He had a few minutes of conversation with reporters when leaving the station. Zhang said first: "I came to Shanghai this time entirely hoping to get a few days of quiet rest, and there are no other tasks, so I have no opinions to express." The reporter asked: "Where does Mr. Zhang live?" He answered: "Please forgive me, I don't want to disclose where I am staying this time. I am someone who likes friends. If it is disclosed, friends will come to see me, and I can't not see them, otherwise they will misunderstand that I am putting on official airs." The reporter asked again: "Then, Mr. Qi Baishi, your new teacher, is now in Shanghai. Aren't you going to see him?" He answered: "Because Teacher Qi will be returning to Beiping in three or five days, I will of course go to visit him and say goodbye to him." The reporter also said: "I heard that all circles in Shanghai will have a grand welcome party to welcome your teacher and Mr. Pu Xinyu. Can you go to that welcome party?" He answered: "I don't know what day this welcome party is. If my spirit is slightly recovered by then, I will definitely go. Otherwise, I would be too disrespectful to my teacher." The reporter asked again: "I heard that Mr. Jiang allowed you to become a student of Mr. Qi. Is that right?" He said: "Chairman Jiang, because he values this 86-year-old master of the art world, once took the time to meet him. He will naturally not object to my becoming a student of Mr. Qi." "I heard that you gave a report of more than two hours on the night of the ceremony of becoming a student, which has not yet been published. Can you publish the manuscript so that everyone knows why you are 50 years old and still want to become a student?" "Because I have been too excited recently and my spirit is not good, the report manuscript has not yet been整理. If you must have it after it is 정리, I can publish it." "Mr. Zhang, I heard that when you became a student, you sent your teacher some inexpensive but very interesting local products from your hometown. So, what did your teacher give you as a souvenir?" "My teacher said that when he returns to Beiping, he will paint a few pictures that he thinks are satisfactory and send them to me." At this point, he had already walked out of the station and got into the car with those who had come to meet him.

### Social Service: Tuberculosis is Becoming More Rampant One Year After the Victory (Part 1)

More than a year has passed in an instant since the victory. Shanghai, which has always been regarded as a tuberculosis city, has not been able to improve the lives of ordinary citizens, so it is still a good target for tuberculosis attacks.

Those present included Chairman Wu, Vice Chairman Li, Committee members Dong Yunchang, Wang Yangxian, Yang Xiren, Wang Qiyu, Guo Huo, Tang Xinghai, and the head of the committee's business division, Liu Wenteng. Chairman Wu Bian chaired the meeting, which lasted two hours. Two resolutions were passed:

(1) Based on the four measures decided upon at the ninth regular meeting of the Textile Control Committee, Wang Qiyu, Chairman of the Cotton Textile Association of the Sixth District, and Tang Zhiliang, Chairman of the Yarn Business Association, had negotiated several agreements. These were presented for discussion at yesterday's meeting. After revisions, the full text of six articles was approved as follows:

(A) All cotton yarn transactions completed before yesterday (July 7th), regardless of price, that have already been settled, will be considered final. (B) For cotton yarn held by customers that has not yet been picked up, if the price exceeds 1.75 million yuan, both parties should negotiate a resolution. If the price is less than 1.75 million yuan, customers must clear it out within three days. (C) For the negotiated resolution of prices exceeding 1.75 million yuan in the above article, the factory should provide a subsidy in the form of a compensation method. The recipients of the subsidy will be the holders of warehouse receipts. (D) After the warehouse receipt holders negotiate a resolution with the factory regarding the above item, they should note the date of verification and correction on the original warehouse receipt. (E) Each factory should thoroughly investigate and verify the names and addresses of the warehouse receipt holders.

(2) Factories selling yarn should adhere to the principle of 1.75 million yuan for 20-count spot yarn. For futures, interest at a rate of 1.5 fen per day should be calculated and borne by the factory.

The Textile Control Committee will issue instructions to the Cotton Textile Association of the Sixth District today, ordering its members to implement these resolutions. At the same time, Tang Zhiliang, Chairman of the Yarn Business Association, will be summoned to a meeting and instructed that the retail profit margin for cotton yarn must not exceed 10% of the negotiated price, and the wholesale profit margin must not exceed 5%.

It has also been learned that Chairman Wu will visit President Song again today to discuss the issue of opening up foreign exchange for American cotton.

### The Central Bank Vigorously Sells at High Prices, Gold Prices Forced to Turn Back, Over 4,000 Bars Sold

Yesterday, the Central Bank struggled with speculators, with prices initially rising and then falling. The morning opened at 2.46 million. Silver shops and securities firms showed unwavering buying interest, and the price rose above 2.48 million. The Central Bank vigorously sold at high prices, showing a strong selling intention. Before long, the wind changed direction, and because the allocation time was near, buyers temporarily adopted a wait-and-see attitude. In an instant, the price plummeted to below 2.385 million before stabilizing. After recovering to 2.4 million, the Central Bank allocated 115 bars at a price of 2.4025 million, with brisk sales. Wealthy individuals and securities speculators all came to inquire. Near noon, the price recovered to 2.46 million, struggling at around 2.455 million at noon. In the afternoon, next-day delivery initially held firm but then weakened. The Central Bank continued to sell vigorously, with a total of over 4,000 bars sold throughout the day. In the end, the price was suppressed to 2.41 million, a drop of 45,000 from the previous close. Gold ornaments were at 56,000, silver rose to 3,400, silver dollars slightly decreased, dark interest rates remained unchanged, and interest rates remained around 1.5 fen.

Foreign currency lacked a speculative atmosphere. US dollars showed no signs of improvement, with the dark market price at a low of 4,100 yuan and a high not exceeding 4,180 yuan. The noon price was below 4,150 yuan, similar to the previous close. Hong Kong dollars were also lackluster, with a slight decrease of 5 yuan. Hong Kong telegraphic transfers were around 870 yuan, Indian exchange rates were 1,055 yuan, and British exchange rates were 14,100 yuan, still with supply exceeding demand and very few transactions. The official exchange rate for US dollars remained unchanged, but there were no direct trades.

### Government Bonds: Flat and Weak, Unified Bonds to be Drawn Again

Government bonds remained stable yesterday. Unified Bonds C opened in the morning at 1,270 yuan. With some selling from Fuyuan and others, the price fell to 1,130 yuan, but then buyers provided some support, and the price rose to 1,280 yuan mid-day, struggling around 1,250 yuan afterwards. The closing price was similar to the previous day's. Type A bonds fell 70 yuan, Type B bond number 614 had a payment and rose 30 yuan, Unified Bond D fell 100 yuan, Unified Bond E decreased 190 yuan, and approximately 5 million yuan worth of bonds were traded.

### Textile Construction Cloth Up 1,000 Yuan, Yarn Prices Down Slightly by 10,000 to 20,000

[Our Report] Yesterday, the yarn market lacked the strength to rise. Special Double Horse initially shouted a high of 2.3 million in the morning, but there were no buyers, and no transactions were made. For other 20-count yarn, due to the Textile Control Committee's decision to prohibit the black market from the 11th of this month, the industry stopped buying and observed the situation. Sentiment turned soft, and sellers were quite active, but there were few buyers. Medium and small 20-count yarn fell by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. There were some transactions for 20-count cone yarn, with prices based on the allocated price plus profit.

Yesterday, the cloth market unanimously improved, and sales were more active than before. Textile construction cloth prices for all grades also increased by about 1,000 yuan. Many people went to apply for allocation. Yesterday's market prices: fine cloth at 81,750 yuan, Blue Chicken at 79,000 yuan, Yang He at 75,000 yuan, Four Gentlemen drill old goods at 94,000 yuan, Four Gentlemen printed white at 91,000 yuan, and warehouse receipt goods traded at 89,000 yuan.

### Cloth Price Review Committee: Retains Cost Calculation

[Our Report] The Cotton Cloth Review Committee held its third regular meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday in the conference room of the Social Affairs Bureau. Attendees included Director Gu of the Social Affairs Bureau, Zhu Shangyi of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Wu Shufang and Chen Jiazhen of the Textile Construction Company, Wu Shuying and Yan Guangdi of the Cotton Textile Industry Association of the Sixth District, Lu Runjin of the Machine Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association, and Jiu Feng and Bei Zairong of the Cotton Cloth Industry Association. Director Yuan first reported on the minutes of the previous meeting. Then, the discussion of cloth costs began, using the cost calculation tables for various grades of goods submitted by the dyeing and weaving industry as data, which were reviewed and revised individually. However, the current cloth market has fallen below the actual cost, so it was decided that the cost calculation figures would be temporarily retained by the Social Affairs Bureau. It was decided that Wu Shuying of the Cotton Textile Industry Association of the Sixth District would explain that the current market cloth prices are indeed insufficient to cover costs. To achieve balance, it is hoped that the authorities will adopt effective measures for flower allocation as soon as possible, so that raw material costs can be reduced, and yarn prices can also be reduced again. If yarn prices can be reduced again, cloth prices will not only be sufficient to cover costs but can also continue to be suppressed. Otherwise, cloth factories are in a very dangerous situation. Finally, Director Gu said that from now on, any illegal black markets that exceed the price limits should strictly abide by the methods set by the government, and judicial organs should severely punish them to ensure complete elimination.

### Silk Sales Were Dull

Yesterday, rayon saw a slight increase again. Because there were actual sales, manufacturers were procuring from the black market, which aroused desires for profit. No boxes of 120-count old-packaging Tianqiao bright goods were traded; only two or three boxes of new-packaging goods were traded. In the morning, they traded for 3.17 million to 3.2 million yuan; in the afternoon, they traded for 3.2 million to 3.3 million yuan, slightly more lively than the previous day, trading for 40,000 to 50,000 yuan more. Yesterday, 120-count semi-pioneering also shouted a price increase of 50,000 yuan. Factory operations were sluggish. Market prices were stable without change. Transactions were extremely dull. Silk goods were also hovering on a path of weakness, mainly because the weather was too warm and business in retail stores was slow. Local sales markets were limited, and procurement by wholesalers was also rare, leading to this situation.

### Although Raw Peanuts and Soybeans Fell, Oil Prices Have Not Yet Returned to Normal

Over 10,000 dan of various goods arrived in the north and south rice markets, but digestion remained slow. Medium and low-grade northern and southern japonica rice continued to weaken by 1,000 yuan. Yang Xian and Bu Xian rice showed slight softening, and Du Xian and Ke Xian rice decreased by 300 to 500 yuan. Limited high prices, white yuan sales remain sluggish. Flour arrivals and sales were both scarce, with no temporary relief. Wheat was sluggish, continuing to fall by 300 to 500 yuan. Although soybean sources were scarce, sales were unsatisfactory, falling by 1,000 yuan. Sesame seeds rose slightly by 1,000 yuan. Qingdao shipments of raw peanuts alone surged, while Nanyang shipments were unresolved. The local market outlook was pessimistic, and it entered a weakened state again. High-grade goods fell by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, and medium-grade goods plummeted by 4,000 to 5,000 yuan. The arrival of soybeans from the Northeast increased, with supply exceeding demand, gradually falling, and the outlook was not optimistic. The oil market lacked raw oil and soybean oil, and there were no formal market prices. Only refined oil was traded, with prices rising by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Sesame oil also continued to rise.

### China Vegetable Oil Factory Allocates Edible Oil, Deadline for Payment Within Three Days

The China Vegetable Oil Factory allocates edible oil at 200 barrels per day. On the 7th, the allocation was changed to 200 barrels of pure raw oil, priced at 99,000 yuan per dan. It is reported that oil merchants often do not pick up the edible oil allocated by China Vegetable Oil Factory. Outsiders mistakenly believe that they cannot allocate enough. In fact, the factory allocates according to the number requested by each oil merchant every day. In view of this situation, the factory has decided to change the allocation method. For the allocation of edible oil, if payment is not made and goods are not picked up within three days, their oil allocation qualification will be canceled, and it will be re-allocated to qualified retail stores that have applied.

### Stabilizing the Black Market for US Dollars: Rely on Exchange Settlement Documents for Delivery

According to people in the export industry, currently, for export goods, it is necessary to apply to the Central Bank or Chase Bank for a certificate proving the foreign exchange amount for the goods has been collected by the bank or credited to the bank's account. Only then can customs allow export based on the bank's certificate. This method can be considered meticulous. However, for import goods, this is not the case. Therefore, every time foreign shipments arrive, US dollars are searched for, and the black market rises. If customs also required the original exchange settlement documents from the settling bank before allowing the delivery of import goods, the agitation in the black market for US dollars would be greatly eased.

### Tea Exports from Japan

[United Press Tokyo, 6th] The Allied Supreme Commander today ordered the Japanese government procurement agency to extract one million pounds of tea from its tea reserves and hand it over to the Japan Tea Export Company for export purposes.

### Lowering Daily Interest Rates in the Banking and Money Industry: Reducing Overdue Interest to 1.5 Fen Per Month

The Ministry of Finance is very determined to suppress interest rates. It has telegraphed the Central Bank to lower lending interest rates as much as possible when approving them to alleviate the people's difficulties. National opinion also believes that the high interest rates are one of the reasons for the decline of industry and commerce. It has been learned that the Municipal Money Industry Association will reduce the daily interest rate for overdue payments by 5 jiao starting today, that is, from 5.5 yuan to 5 yuan per day per thousand yuan, calculating to a monthly interest rate of 1.5 fen. The daily interest rate for inter-industry loans is 3.3 yuan per day per thousand yuan. The daily interest rate for deposits remains at 6 jiao per thousand. Bank interest rates are traditionally negotiated by the money industry and jointly reported by the banking and money industries to the Central Bank for approval. Therefore, the banking and money industries will reduce the daily interest rate starting today.

### Sparse Sugar Transactions

Yesterday, the sugar market trend was weak, continuing to see downward movement. The association quoted spot prices for medium white sugar grade 20 at 132,000 yuan, raw sugar at 112,000 yuan, coarse white sugar grade 24 at 177,000 yuan, and 100-pound Peruvian white sugar at 160,000 yuan. Taiwan Company continued to offer: coarse white sugar grade 24 at 170,000 yuan, half-car white sugar at 180,000 yuan, three-quarters-car white sugar at 150,000 yuan, medium white sugar grade 20 at 130,000 yuan, raw red sugar at 110,000 yuan. However, purchasing applications from the trade were unprecedentedly desolate, totaling less than 10,000 bags. Quoted Taiwanese ordinary sheet ice sugar at 145,000 yuan, Xinghua white at 122,000 yuan, Xing red at 114,000 yuan to 108,000 yuan, Diao Qing at 112,500 yuan to 111,000 yuan, totaling two to three hundred pieces traded.

### Profits Tax: Second Review Meeting Held Yesterday, Tax Payment Notices Issued to Over a Hundred Associations, Additional Levies for Those Who Fail to Report on Time

[Our Report] The Municipal Direct Tax Bureau convened a review meeting at the Jinmen Hotel yesterday to expedite the collection of profits tax for the past year. Director Wang Fuzhou made a special trip from Beijing to attend. Review committee members and representatives from the Chamber of Commerce who attended included Du Yuesheng, Xu Jiluo, Cha Liangjian, Wang Xiaolai (represented by Ge Futian), Xi Yushu, Pan Shihao, and others. From the Tax Bureau, Director Lou, Assistant Ge, Section Chief Wang, and others accompanied Director Wang. Regarding all the report forms previously transferred by the Chamber of Commerce, the bureau presented statistics, stating that taxing at 150% of the originally reported profit amount would yield a tax revenue of over 19.2 billion, which still deviated from the original budget. It was also stated that tax payment notices had been issued to over a hundred associations, and no accounts would be audited. The remaining portions were being reviewed in succession and would be completed shortly. Director Wang also clarified that taxing at 50% of profits was in accordance with the simplified collection method for profits tax promulgated by the Ministry, and he hoped that the Chamber of Commerce would relay this to the various trade associations to avoid misunderstandings. The Chamber of Commerce continued to collect declaration forms, and as of the 5th of this month, a total of over one thousand households had been collected, with profits of over 36 million yuan, which the Chamber of Commerce representatives submitted to the Tax Bureau on the spot. It was also decided to tax based on the average standard capital profit rate of each industry and no further audits would be conducted. However, the minimum limit should not be less than 150% of profits. Those who failed to report on time would not be granted extensions and would be determined separately by the Tax Bureau. The collection standard would be stricter than those who had already reported. For those whose industry was known, it was decided to tax according to the average standard capital profit rate of the industry, plus an additional 20%. For those whose industry was unclear, it was decided to tax by referring to a similar industry or by adding a certain percentage to the city's average standard capital profit rate. At the meeting, the representatives expressed regret that tax-paying units had not fully reported. It was heard that the four major department stores had also not reported. After the meeting, a certain gentleman told others that the simplified collection of profits tax was not limited to within the profit amount. However, it was hoped that the Tax Bureau would not take harassing actions to alleviate the difficulties of businesses.

### This Year's Cotton Production Estimated at Approximately 7.9 Million Dan, Average Yield of Only 24 Jin Per Mu

The Cotton Production Improvement Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Joint Association of the Republic of China Machine Cotton Textile Industry Association, following the precedent of the annual cotton production survey report held by the former China Cotton Mill Owners Association, separately dispatched personnel to cotton-producing provinces to conduct on-site surveys of the cotton production situation in the 35th year. Based on the surveyor's report, the first estimate was released. This estimate was compiled based on the survey reports from twelve cotton-producing provinces, including Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Hubei, Hunan, and Sichuan. However, the situation in Shandong Province was special. The surveyor dispatched by this association returned from Qingdao, and the numbers listed were provided by Mr. Hu Pingchu of the Shandong Provincial Department of Construction, as requested by the North China Cotton Production Improvement Office. For Shanxi Province, in addition to the personnel dispatched by this association for investigation, the Central China Cotton Production Improvement Office also requested the Shanxi Provincial Department of Construction to handle it. Also, for the twelve cotton-producing counties in Hunan Province, as of November 5th, only four county reports had been received. Repeated telegrams were sent urging them, but the surveyor had not yet replied. Therefore, the numbers listed are only a portion and will be revised in the second release.

This year's survey was delayed due to preparations, and transportation in various places was also obstructed. The estimate report was generally based on the cotton situation before October 25th. The units of measurement are all municipal units.

This year's cotton production has made great progress compared to last year, but it is still far from the 26th year. This may be due to the widespread war, the lack of food, cotton farmers' unwillingness to plant cotton, and the high production costs due to transportation obstacles. The production and sales sides have not embarked on a prosperous path, and irregular rainfall is also a reason. As for pest damage, the losses are relatively small. This estimate includes a total of 32,418,169 mu of cotton fields, producing 7,895,610 dan of lint cotton, with an average of 24 jin of lint cotton produced per mu.

### Free Remittances for Family Support: Four Banks Agreed on Measures

The original text is excerpted as follows:

(1) For personnel serving in public and private institutions whose family members are not with them at their duty station and need to remit their salary income for support, if the service institution proves and applies for the remittance, this method shall be followed. (2) For the first remittance application, the service institution shall verify and prepare a complete list, affixing the official seal for certification, and submit it to the local branch of the Four Banks for review and distribution, and notify each bank to accept the remittance. For subsequent monthly applications, the remitter should truthfully submit an application directly to the original remitting bank. If there is no branch of the Four Banks in the local area, each bank should consult with each other and handle it in accordance with this method. (3) The remittance amount is limited to 100,000 national currency, but with proof from the service institution, it can be negotiated according to half of the applicant's total monthly salary income. (4) Each person is limited to one remittance per month. (5) This remittance is free of remittance fees. (6) This method will be implemented after being passed by the board of directors of the Four Banks Joint Treasury and reported to the Ministry of Finance for record.

### Another Estimate of Tobacco Leaf Production

This newspaper published on the 30th of last month that China's tobacco production ranks second in the world. Now, according to a reader's letter from the Millard's Review, China's tobacco production is estimated to be third in the world, not second. The United States produces the most tobacco in the world, followed by India, and then China. According to the statistics of 1937, mainland China produced 150 million pounds of tobacco, the Northeast produced 100 million pounds, and Taiwan produced 15 million pounds. This is recorded here for reference.

### Chinese Stocks Cannot Recover, Bearish Sentiment Forces People, Broker Number 164 Grounded

Chinese stocks continued to be unable to recover in a situation of demoralization yesterday. The banking sector, such as Xingye, Jiaotong, Zhongnan, and Tongshang, tried to maintain them, but the sellers took full advantage and were always succumbed to the sellers' momentum. When the morning opened, the stocks were still flat. Number 164 was banned from entering the market, and people were hit, feeling extremely pessimistic. Even if someone commissioned Traffic Bank Number 31 to supplement Number 164's purchase of 85,000 Xinyi shares and 2,000 American Asia shares, the selling was like a tidal wave. After opening, it showed a one-sided decline. After ten o'clock, numbers 89 and others made supplementary purchases, causing a slight reaction, but the market showed rampant short-selling. Although the power of those who shorted was not strong, the momentum forced the market to be suppressed. Although there were twists and turns due to constant absorption by the banking sector, almost all stocks ended at low prices near noon, except for Qinxing. Compared with the previous closing, popular stocks like Yong Yarn, Jingfu, Xinguang, Qinxing, and American Asia each fell by half a percent to one percent, while Leng Jing alone fell by nearly 20%, and the rest also fell by half a percent to one percent. The weakness continued slightly in the afternoon. The 600-yuan mark of Yong Yarn was soon broken. After 2:30 PM, it was the weakest, but numbers 168 and 169 came to buy at low prices, and gradually recovered after the low. Xinguang suddenly rebounded by more than ten yuan under the purchase of Traffic Bank Number 31, standing out alone. The rest still did not escape the consolidation. Compared with the previous closing, popular stocks like Yong Yarn, American West, and Jingfu fell by 8 to 9 percent, Xinyi fell by over 10 percent, and Qinxing only fell by slightly less than half a percent. Cold stocks Datong, Match, Yonggong, Jinglun, and Underwear each fell by over 10 percent, Huaxing slightly rose, and the rest all fell. Stocks outside the market also continued to decline.

The stable trend of foreign stocks was still difficult to maintain. Many popular stocks were still liquidated and retreated again. Yeguang, Gangye, and Huidong Paper were relatively cold and could still be supported. As a result, except for the aforementioned four types, all fell by about half a percent.

### Ministry of Education Approves Three Measures for Issuing Public Expenses

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] The Ministry of Education recently approved three measures for issuing public expenses: (1) Approved veterans who have retired from the Youth Army will continue to receive the original public expenses according to the regulations of the Youth Enlistment Preference Method. However, those who have not been approved for public expenses also have the same request. In order to take care of the studies of youth enlisted students, all youth enlisted returning students who have been approved for discharge by the part concerned will be granted full public expenses (tuition, accommodation, and meal expenses are waived; other expenses are not included). Those who have not been approved by the part concerned are not included. (2) Loyal youth or students who have escaped from the communist areas, whose families are trapped in the communist areas and whose economic sources have been cut off, and who have been thoroughly investigated and found to be true, and who have obtained reliable certificates sufficient to prove their status, will be granted public expenses. (3) The temporary supplementary classes of Lin Da are all limited to end in July. The original two types of relief funds, A and B, should be cancelled uniformly. These students, even if they have been assigned by the ministry, are no different from the new students recruited by various schools. The granting of their public expenses should still be in accordance with the prescribed public expense method, and public expenses should be approved separately within the prescribed clauses.

### Japan Announces Three-Year Plan to Rebuild 4,000 Schools

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 6th, Associated Press] The Japanese government has announced a "three-year plan" to restore the 4,000 schools destroyed during the war.

### Ministry of Education Spokesperson on Overseas Study Policy

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] Recently, several newspapers have discussed the policy regarding studying abroad, with varying opinions on whether it should be lenient or strict. A reporter visited the Ministry of Education to inquire, and according to the spokesperson of the ministry: It is a good phenomenon that people in society are concerned about education. The Ministry of Education has always been very cautious about the policy on studying abroad and is also very open to considering social discourse. During the eight years of the war, European and American academic fields advanced rapidly. The situation of rapid progress is far beyond what we can imagine. To catch up with the times, we must start from two aspects. On one hand, we should actively enrich the equipment of our universities to seek a fundamental solution. On the other hand, we should also select promising young talents to study abroad to avoid falling behind. As for cultivating university faculty, we must also plan for this in advance. However, if there are no restrictions, the children of wealthy people can freely go abroad, which will inevitably lead to abuses. This can be stated definitively. The admission standards for self-funded students this year are slightly broader than those for publicly funded students, but stricter than the previous year's self-funded student examination. In terms of numbers, only 800 people applied in the previous year, while 3,817 people applied this year. The students who have been admitted have only obtained the qualification to go abroad. If they do not have admission documents from foreign universities, they will still not be allowed to go abroad. The amount of foreign exchange is also limited, and it will never be allowed to exceed actual needs, to prevent abuses. As for the management after going abroad and the employment issues after returning to the country, the Ministry of Education has a comprehensive plan. In terms of management, the embassy is currently responsible, and in the future, it is planned to establish cultural specialists to handle it. Returning students will be recommended to relevant agencies by the Ministry of Education. This method has been implemented effectively. Last year, more than 50 students who returned from studying in Europe were mostly employed through the recommendation of the Ministry of Education. In the future, when society is stable and construction is underway, more talents will be needed, and the phenomenon of students being idle and unemployed can be gradually eliminated. In short, the Ministry's implementation of the overseas study policy is considering the overall plan for national and ethnic construction. The society's concern for this matter and the suggestions put forward are most welcome and will be carefully considered by the Ministry.

### Stepping into the Hometown of Guan Zhong

—Mei Gong

Yingshang, October 27th

The first impression of Yingshang, the hometown of Guan Zhong, a great politician in ancient China, to those who come here for the first time is: ancient, remote, dilapidated, and dry.

From Zhengyangguan Husha River sixty miles, to Xinhekou to land, and a little more than one mile west, you arrive at Yingshang County. Entering the east city gate, the first thing you see is the Kui Xing Pavilion, which is half-empty on the north side of the road. The four big characters on the pavilion are "Civilization of the World". The windows of the pavilion are open, and there are several female students of eighteen or nine years old working in the pavilion - not doing needlework, but reading books. Below the pavilion is an arched doorway. Not far to the east through the doorway, is the largest hotel in Yingshang County - the Social Service Office. The rooms are not bad, but the prices for food and drink are not very expensive.

Toilet on the City Wall

Yingshang City is circular and very small, with a circumference of just over one mile. You can walk around the city in a short time. The city wall is made of brick and is no more than a Zhang high, because part of it was removed from the top during the Anti-Japanese War. I climbed the city from the east gate and walked along the top of the city to the north gate. Looking at the autumn wilderness outside the city and the small ponds and willows in the city, the scenery is not bad. However, from the north gate to the west gate to the south gate, this area has almost become a "toilet on the city wall." There is urine every three steps and feces every five steps. The stinky wind is blowing slowly, making people sick. Some adults are pulling down their pants and squatting to defecate. Children and dogs are even more out of the question.

When a stranger first arrives in Yingshang, the most awkward thing is the streets of Yingshang. The four main streets in the east, west, north and south are purely paved with large stone strips. These stones have been tormented and trampled for a long time and are already rugged and uneven. It is very difficult to walk on them.

In front of Guanzi's Tomb

Walking north from the so-called "Yingshang Park", bypassing the pond, you arrive at Guan Zhong's tomb. It is true that it is better to hear about it than to see it, and it is even better to hear about it than to see it. Guan Zhong's tomb is just like that.

A raised earth mound, about Zhang Eight high, with a circumference of more than ten Zhang, is fully planted with green pine trees, which are very lush. There is an ancient stone tablet, the lower end of which is buried in the soil and inclined forward, with the four characters "Tomb of Guan Zhongfu". There is also a recently erected stone tablet, with the big characters "Alas, the Tomb of the Great Politician Guanzi" in the middle. There are several lines of small characters on the side that read "Guan Zhong Zi Yiwu, a native of Yingshang, Confucius said: Guan Zhong assisted Duke Huan, dominated the princes, and rectified the world..." all the way to "Without Guan Zhong, we would be disheveled and wear our clothes on the left." A section of text ends. The font is written in Wei stele, but according to the era, it is a Republic of China stele.

Not far to the east from Guanbao Temple is the Yingshang Relief Home. The houses are all newly built, about thirty rooms, divided into old-age homes, orphanages, infant nurseries, clinics and other parts. Each has a director in charge of its affairs. The Boai Hall has become a children's church, which is very good. The clinic is located on North Main Street in the city, and those who seek medical treatment and medicine are quite crowded. Nine out of ten are suffering from hidden diseases, followed by 　　.

Such Education

Right next to Kui Xing's neighbor is the Yingshang County Mass Education Center. The curator, Cui, is known to be a kind and prudent good person at first glance. In the library and reading room, there is not a single book. There are a few newspapers, but they are all old newspapers from half a month ago. The tables and chairs are broken and incomplete. The walls and roof are dilapidated. It is too unsightly. Curator Cui said that the monthly operating expenses are only two thousand yuan, which is not enough to subscribe to the Central Daily News for half a month (the Central Daily News requires two thousand two hundred and fifty yuan for half a month). The Yingshang Mass Education Center cannot even afford a newspaper, then other equipment such as balls and chess are naturally out of the question.

Yingshang is a fourth-class county, and the county town has a total population of only over 10,000 people, but there are three secondary schools, which is not a small number. The County Middle School is generally considered the best. The principal, Jiang Xiaokong, is a small fat man wearing glasses and is very enthusiastic about education. The principal of the County Simple Normal School, Jiang Mingqiu, is over fifty years old, with gray hair and a cheerful manner. He is an old educator for many years. The principal of the private Yiwu Middle School, Zixijian, is a kind person. The three schools accept both male and female students, and there are many students, but the academic performance of the students is really poor. In my opinion, this is an inevitable result of the poor primary education in the county. A sixth-grade student at an elementary school asked the teacher what the Three People's Principles were, and the teacher replied: "The Three People's Principles are the idea of three types of people: scholars, farmers, and workers." This kind of thing is self-explanatory.

In addition to the three middle schools in the town, there is also an agricultural vocational school and a private Chengde Middle School in the countryside. Since I have not visited them, I will not say anything about them.

A few dozen steps out of the south gate, you can see the school gate of Yiwu Middle School. Yiwu is Guan Zhong's alias. This must be a school established to commemorate Guanzi. The school gate faces due east, directly opposite the nursery. The nursery is the location of the Yingshang Agricultural Extension Office. The area is not very large, and the natural environment is very good, but it is a pity that there is too little artificial management and design, and no signs of agricultural "extension" can be seen. 　　Small Newspaper

Propaganda and news newspapers are even more pitiful in Yingshang. There are two types of small stone-printed single-sided newspapers in the city. One is the "Xinying Daily", which is issued by the Yingtou Liaison Station of the Wangan Group, and one is issued every five days. The content is average. The other is the "Yingshang Daily". It is called a daily newspaper, but it is actually published every two days. The content is slightly better, but the layout is too small and the material is not rich enough. You can read the entire newspaper without missing a word in less than a quarter of an hour, and its "smallness" can be known. The subscription price of the Yingshang Daily is very low, 400 yuan per month. However, a stranger who goes to Yingshang cannot see the Yingshang Daily. There are no newspaper reading columns on the streets and alleys, no businesses and households, and no Baogu Jia in urban and rural areas. Where did the Yingshang Daily sell to? This is indeed an interesting and sad issue.

Poor Disaster Victims

As it stands, the most important issue in Yingshang is "relieving disaster victims." Disaster victims are widespread in Yingshang. Because the Shaying River and the Yellow River follow the same path, Yingshang was flooded for eight years during the eight-year Anti-Japanese War. This year after the victory, it suffered an unprecedented major flood again. From the Sancha River, not far northeast of the county seat, to Xieqiao Market, what used to be a flat road is now forty miles long, and small boats sail on the water as if floating in a large lake. Those countless villages, one by one, are submerged in the water! Some do not even see the shadow of the house, only the treetops remain, protruding from the water. Looking around, the sky is connected to the water, the water is connected to the sky, a vast expanse, boundless! All the disaster victims are sallow and emaciated, and a large number of people have died from the epidemic. According to reliable statistics, a total of 1.37 million mu of land in Yingshang was submerged, accounting for more than one-half of the total land area of the county. There are a total of 27,060 households of disaster victims, 77,602 adults, and 60,200 children, totaling more than 137,000 people. These disaster victims lack clothing and food. Seeing that the harsh winter is coming, how will they survive?

### Seeing Xi'an Through a Drop of Water

— Special Correspondent Li Chi from this Newspaper

Xi'an Airmail, 2nd

It's as if the English poet William Blake wrote in two lines of poetry: "To see a world in a grain of sand, and a heaven in a wild flower." As a reporter, I am ashamed that I don't have such "magic power," I only want to see this ancient imperial capital—Chang'an—through a drop of water.

People who grow up on the coast of the East China Sea seem to be indifferent to water. City dwellers living along the coast with tap water supply seem to think that water (and air and sunlight, equally important elements of life!) is just something that flows out of the faucet. Who has the leisure to think about what will happen when the lead pipes have no water to draw up?

However, in the Northwest, as long as you arrive at Chang'an, the first gateway from the Central Plains to the Great Northwest, the concept of water is completely different. When I, as a reporter, arrived in Xi'an during the cold winter months of previous years, my first impression of the Northwest that day was the extremely alkaline and murky boiled water in my mouth. You had to drink it even if you couldn't swallow it. Looking back at the well in the house, which was more than fifty feet deep, the worker took a long time to shake the well before drawing out half a bucket of something that didn't resemble water from the bottom of the well. At that time, I thought of how precious the water wells in my hometown in the South were, often full to the brim, and I also thought of the "luxury" of Hong Kong often using half-foot diameter fire hydrants to flush street toilets and drains.

Not Seeing the Eight Rivers Circling Chang'an Causes Heartache

The loess in the Northwest contains a lot of alkali, so the water inevitably tastes bitter. There is a so-called "Sweet Water Well" in the southwest of Xi'an. The so-called "sweet" is actually just a lighter bitter taste, but it is already precious enough.

The taste of water is actually a small matter, because the leisurely lifestyle of "tea tasting" is long outdated. The serious problem, however, lies in the fact that the lack of water supply and the high cost of drawing water directly and fatally limit the establishment of many industries, the realization of urban scale and high-rise buildings, and, more broadly, the threat to every citizen is that the lack of water brings more diseases and harms the health of citizens. This fact will be substantiated by specific figures later.

However, was Chang'an as lacking in water supply in the past as it is today? I don't think so, because the first condition for population concentration is that the water problem must be solved first. The Bangzi Opera "Twice Blooming Plum" tells the story of Chen Xingyuan and the foreign story. When Chen arrived outside the Great Wall and thought of her hometown Chang'an, she sang on the overlooking hometown platform: "I can't see the eight rivers circling Chang'an, it makes my heart ache!..." These eight rivers can represent the prosperity and developed water conservancy of Chang'an in those years.

According to Professor Gu's research: the names of these eight rivers are the Jing River and Wei River north of Chang'an City, the Chan River and Ba River south of the city, the Lao River and Ju River east of the city, and the Feng River and Lao River west of the city. He also said: "If you want to nitpick, savoring the word "circling" in "eight rivers circling Chang'an" really describes the scenery near Chang'an vividly!"

However, that line in the play can only be sung by Chen Xingyuan at that time, because today, Xi'an only relies on the Jing River and Wei River. The other six rivers are silted up, dried up, and some even have no trace of the riverbed. There is no question of "circling"!

Skin Disease "Wins the Championship," Trachoma Ranks Second

Let's first look at the rainfall in Xi'an: the average rainfall in Chang'an in the past eighteen years is only 500 millimeters per year, which is about seven-tenths of the minimum 700 millimeters in the Jiangzhe area, and one-third of the maximum 1,500 millimeters. Xi'an is also less than two-thirds of the 760 millimeters of rainfall in Hanzhong area in southern Shaanxi Province; however, it is four-tenths more than the only 350 millimeters of rainfall in northern Shaanxi. From the above figures, we can see how drastic the difference in rainfall is between the southern, central, and northern parts of Shaanxi. However, forest science tells us that afforestation can change the climate. Many examples prove that after the completion of the afforestation plan, the local rainfall can increase by one-half. It is up to people to make it happen, and people will conquer nature. Also, it is said that a major drought occurred in Xi'an in the years 1928 and 1929, when the rainfall was only 200 to 300 millimeters. At that time, all the vegetation inside and outside the city was completely scorched. Therefore, 99% of the trees we see in the city today were planted after 1930. Why do people forget such a painful experience so quickly?

Please look at the records of the Provincial Hospital in Xi'an, which has a history of fifteen years and treats 100,000 outpatients every year: according to the hospital's precise statistics of departments and diseases (from July to December last year), the most common patients in the ophthalmology department are various types of trachoma; the top three in the dermatology and venereal disease department are various types of eczema, impetigo, and scabies; and in the internal medicine department, lung disease accounts for one-tenth of the cases, ranking first.

Let's zoom out and look at the disease statistics for the entire Shaanxi Province. According to the latest figures released by the Shaanxi Provincial Health Department, skin disease "wins the championship," and trachoma ranks only second. They also added the following explanation: in the hilly areas of northern Shaanxi and the mountainous areas of southern Shaanxi, due to the lack of water, the "rampant" prevalence of skin diseases and trachoma is even more severe than in the Jingwei River Basin in Guanzhong.

Think about it: people living in cave dwellings who never dare to imagine having other water consumption besides the water they drink, aren't they the most qualified to suffer from eczema, scabies, and trachoma? Fortunately, the Northwest has sufficient sunlight, which invisibly kills many bacteria, and the transmission and infection of lung diseases can therefore be considered to be more through the esophagus and stomach than through the nasal cavity and trachea. I have seen kitchens that provide food for fifty people, and in order to save a basin of water, they would rather patiently wipe each of the fifty pairs of chopsticks with a cloth after meals for "dry cleaning." I have seen enough of the waiters in the middle and upper-class restaurants wiping their chopsticks on their scarves after the guests finish eating and putting them back in the chopstick tube to wait for the next guest to use. I have also seen enough of a soybean milk vendor and a soup noodle vendor never using any water to wash spoons, bowls, or utensils from the time they open for business until they sell out. Countless examples prove how terrible the lack of water is, increasing the chances of infectious diseases. Although having water does not necessarily completely eliminate the above-mentioned most prevalent diseases, undoubtedly, if everyone has sufficient water for use, drinking water, and boiled water, at the very least, it will greatly reduce the chance of getting sick.

Water, Brighter Than Diamonds, Is an Urgent Task

"One pound of treatment is not as good as one ounce of prevention," but effective prevention often needs to be extended to social environmental hygiene and social treatment policies. In the Northwest, right at its first gateway—Xi'an—the relationship between water and environmental hygiene has already been seen.

China's century-old or even millennium-old plan is not limited to the southeastern coast. To design with foresight, it is necessary to inject development into the northwestern corner. After the recovery, I haven't heard the slogan of building the Great Northwest for a long time, but I believe that the Northwest will one day be valued again, and those who come to the Northwest with grand plans must first consider the fight for water and against diseases. Europeans and Americans developed Southeast Asia and the Philippines and established tropical medicine, and the Japanese invasion of China also established "continental medicine." These are all good examples. Large-scale development of the Northwest must start with the health care of immigrants. Secondly, the health care of the local residents should also be given the same attention. According to doctors returning from Xinjiang and Qinghai, the Han people brought many diseases, which were not serious among the Han people, but because the local people had never had these diseases, they naturally lacked resistance, so the condition was unexpectedly serious. However, in any case, before medicine and drugs, what is more urgently needed is still water, water that is brighter than diamonds!

Hygiene and Medicine

### On Injections and Prescriptions (Part 2)

— Qian De

(4) Treatment Should Focus on General Principles

After a disease breaks out, it must be diagnosed and treated early, but treatment is not limited to medication. Paying attention to general principles, maintaining and increasing physical strength to facilitate the fight against the disease is ten times more important than taking medicine and injections. Even if it is a minor illness such as a cold and cough, if these principles are not followed, it may worsen and turn into pneumonia. By that time, lying down again, fortunately being able to recover, the spirit, time, and economy have suffered several times the losses. The following principles may seem like clichés, and are unremarkable, but if they can be earnestly observed in the diagnosis, treatment, and recovery period, it will definitely be greatly beneficial to the progress of the disease.

1. Give the patient sufficient physical and mental rest, so that his body is full of energy to fight the disease.

2. Give the patient sufficient calories, appropriate protein, carbohydrates, fats, salts, and vitamins to increase his resistance and repair ability. As long as his stomach and intestines can digest and breathe, a balanced diet can provide him with all the daily needs. In cases of gastrointestinal diseases, diabetes, and kidney disease, dietary regulation is even more important, and should be followed after being determined by a doctor.

3. Keep the functions of bowel movements and the skin unimpeded, so as to facilitate the removal of waste and toxins. Generally speaking, except for organic edema, drinking more water is always good.

4. It is necessary to take methods to alleviate the symptoms that the patient feels the most painful, hinder his tranquility, and weaken his physical strength. If medication is needed, the principle is not to conceal the original appearance of the disease and hinder diagnosis.

The purpose is nothing more than (1) to use symptomatic drugs or special drugs to treat the disease after the diagnosis is established, and (2) to give special drugs to test their efficacy in order to achieve the purpose of indirect diagnosis when the diagnosis is not certain and a certain disease is suspected. Prescriptions should have indications and are by no means for courtesy. They cannot be issued casually. Once medication is started, it should be thoroughly implemented to achieve complete success. However, there is no medicine that is perfect and without drawbacks. Similarly, two people with the same disease have different symptoms, and two people have different reactions to the same medicine. Even the same patient's reaction to the medicine varies depending on the situation. Therefore, treatment must have principles and cannot be fixed. There is no saying that a certain medicine will definitely cure a certain disease, let alone a panacea that can be taken regularly. For example, Tubercidin is effective against amebic dysentery, but an overdose can also cause diarrhea; alkaline powder is effective against peptic ulcers, but it is not equally effective against other "stomach diseases." How to recognize the indications, be familiar with the properties of the medicine, choose the timing, carefully increase or decrease the dosage, and let the patient know its advantages and disadvantages to achieve the highest therapeutic effect is the responsibility of the doctor.

The so-called thorough treatment is not only the disappearance of symptoms, but also the root cause and prevention of recurrence. Originally, various diseases, unless they quickly progress to death, generally have remission phenomena in the process. Without treatment, they can also be temporarily reduced, and when they recur, they are even worse. For example, after one or two injections of 914 for syphilis, local symptoms can disappear, and hemoptysis of pulmonary tuberculosis can be stopped by taking some unrelated medicines. This certainly does not mean that syphilis and tuberculosis have been cured. There are many similar examples. How can it be considered a cure? The doctor knows it in his heart, but because the patient is already satisfied with this and publishes a thank-you note in the newspaper, he also enjoys the success. This is really a tragicomedy.

There is now a very common and extremely dangerous phenomenon, that is, the widespread abuse of sulfonamide drugs. Drug dealers can use it to make pills, injections, toothpaste, etc. Patients also believe that this is a good home medicine for governing all diseases. Since it is called "anti-inflammatory pills," they don't care about colds, coughs, toothaches, or fevers. As long as they think it is "inflammation," they can prescribe it themselves and take it casually and piecemeal. We often criticize traditional Chinese medicine for prescribing dozens of medicines in one prescription as a complex prescription (Gun Shat prescription). This situation of governing all diseases with one medicine can be called sweep therapy. After all, how many diseases are cured by this is questionable, because the efficacy of this medicine can only be achieved after regular and large doses are taken for several days; but there must be some patients who develop poisoning or drug resistance due to this irregular use, and it will no longer be effective when it must be taken. This is tantamount to using a sharp knife as a toy, which is very regrettable. Similarly, penicillin was a great invention in the medical field during this war, and it has saved countless lives. However, in the producing countries, it still cannot be supplied without restrictions. In our country, it has become a worshipped product for patients and a tool for colleagues to make money, and it is abused to an unbelievable extent! The author knows that some people have used it to treat abdominal distension and injected it every other day to treat stomach cancer. If Dr. A. Fleming knew about this, he would definitely feel both funny and sad.

All of the above violate the principles of treatment. Patients are ignorant of this. How to correct this trend is also the responsibility of the doctor.

(6) Is Injection Necessary?

Now that it has been decided that medication is needed, it is nothing more than to enter it through various routes such as oral administration, injection, inhalation, enema, and topical application. Because the biggest use of the mouth is eating, it is the simplest, most natural, and most commonly used route of administration should be oral administration. However, because of the injection fees and surgery fees, drug dealers and doctors cooperated sincerely. Drug dealers manufactured some injections for replenishing blood, clearing blood, strengthening the heart, etc., with numerous categories. It is not necessary to use drugs at all, but injections are given. It is clear that oral administration can be used, but injections are even more necessary. Doctors are used by others and go to deceive patients. They take the opportunity to persuade them to get injections. Patients are originally ignorant of this, but since people say that a few injections can cure the root cause, and the names of replenishing blood and strengthening the heart sound comfortable, they unknowingly regard this as a fashionable and quick-acting treatment and accept it. Today, they have a mentality that they think that they always have to get a prescription when they see a doctor, and it is best to get an injection. If you tell him that he does not need a prescription and is against injections, he will think that you are an out-of-date and ignorant doctor! You must know: how much money rolls into the pockets of drug dealers and doctors from this? How many patients have local ulcers, infections, and become abscesses and sepsis because they like injections, and thus lost their lives?

So, is "injection" necessary? Injection has its place, but it is only needed in the following situations. Beyond this, it is abuse and business. The indications that require injection are:

1. Those who need rapid drug action in emergency cases, such as acute opium poisoning with Coramine, caffeine, etc.

2. Patients who are comatose and cannot take oral medicine, such as cerebral malignant malaria requiring quinine, and epidemic encephalitis requiring Sofratoluene injection.

3. Patients who cannot tolerate and absorb drugs orally due to vomiting and diarrhea, such as cholera requiring physiological saline injection.

4. Drugs that are decomposed and ineffective by gastric juice after oral administration, such as adrenaline, 914, insulin, plasma, and vaccines.

Some people think that injection can avoid gastrointestinal irritation, but it is unreliable because any drug is more irritating to veins or tissues than to the gastrointestinal tract. Others say that injection can more accurately calculate the dosage, but it is also specious, because the main purpose of drug administration is to be effective, and a slight difference in dosage is not a problem.

In addition to the misfortunes caused by poor injection techniques mentioned in the previous section, injection, especially intravenous injection, can also cause terrible or fatal reactions, and once injected, it cannot be washed out like oral administration. Furthermore, after repeated punctures, phlebitis often occurs, which may cause embolic symptoms. In the future, when intravenous injection is really needed, it will be more difficult because it has been blocked.

There are limited indications that require injections, but the possible accidents and adverse effects are great. May I ask patients, why must you spend dozens of times more on injection drugs than on oral drugs and buy some pain and accidents?

(7) Advise Patients Faithfully

It is not necessary to further explain more to patients on the issue. Only the key points mentioned above are provided as follows:

1. Know some consultant doctors and friends, often have relationships, get more knowledge about daily health maintenance and disease prevention, receive preventive injections and regular health checkups, and if there are any shortcomings, diagnose and treat them early, so as to prevent problems before they occur. These doctor friends know your past situation well and it is easy to diagnose diseases.

2. See a doctor early when you are sick, and tell him the cause and symptoms of the illness, but don't be smart and make a diagnosis yourself. Diagnosis is not necessarily easy, and you should give him enough time for research and observation.

3. Do not seek medical treatment randomly, and do not change doctors often. The busiest doctors are not necessarily the most skilled doctors.

4. Do not take medicine randomly. Medication should be started only after the diagnosis is confirmed. Do not expect to take medicine home every time you see a doctor. Doctors who truthfully tell you how to recuperate without prescribing a prescription are mostly more sincere and reliable than doctors who prescribe prescriptions randomly. The money saved from buying things that are not necessary can be used to adjust your diet, etc., which is more beneficial.

5. No matter what kind of disease, paying attention to nutrition, rest, and physical and mental comfort is at least as important as prescribing medicine. Abandoning this is too much.

6. Medication must have clear indications. To hope for a good therapeutic effect, you must race against time, follow the doctor's advice, and implement it to the end. Irregular, incomplete, or aimless treatment may produce results that are worse than not treating.

7. The safest and most convenient route of drug administration is oral administration. Injections are only needed in a very few cases. Injections have various reactions and harms, cost several times more than oral administration, and have limited efficacy. There is no reason to widely promote them. If a doctor persuades you to get blood-replenishing injections or blood-cleansing injections, this is his business, and you can thank him for his kindness and ignore it.

8. There is no medicine that has no side effects or drawbacks, so all medicines cannot be abused; the condition is constantly changing, and the needs are different accordingly, so there is no prescription that can be taken regularly without the doctor's correction.

9. Doctors always know more about the condition than you do, and they always have their own position on the decisions you make. Complete trust in him is like taking some good medicine for your spirit. Equally important and necessary is that the doctor's success in diagnosis and treatment also depends entirely on your cooperation.

### The Miracle Drug of 1946

— Zhang Ming

Two months ago, this publication's editorial department received a translated manuscript from Mr. Yiwen titled "The Miracle Drug of 1946." The translation was fine, but because the original content was unreliable, it was not published.

The original title of the article, "Gods’ Own Medicine, 1948 Mode," appeared in the June issue of Reader's Digest, authored by Pautl de Cruir.

The author, Cruir, although holding a doctorate, is not a doctor and is known for writing popular medical articles. However, his reports are often exaggerated, leading to inaccuracies. Readers often fall for this. This gentleman frequently publishes such popular medical articles in widely circulated American publications like Reader's Digest, disregarding scientific accuracy and focusing on sensationalism. As a result, the Journal of the American Medical Association has repeatedly written articles to correct his claims. Cruir's article is largely the same as the promotional materials of the American Bayer (Winthrop) company for Demerol, so the editors of the Journal of the American Medical Association criticized him for advertising for pharmaceutical companies and spreading inaccurate information.

The so-called "Miracle Drug of 1946" refers to Demerol. He says, "This drug has a pain-relieving effect similar to morphine but is not as addictive. Many hospitals in the United States have tested this new drug, and many patients who had never used narcotics before did not become addicted at all."

He then embellished with numerous reports praising its various therapeutic effects and advantages, but he did not mention any reports of its drawbacks. Although he lightly mentions, "This drug may also cause a desire in some users, a desire to continue using it," he then adds, "This is not addiction because there are no adverse effects upon withdrawal."

Finally, he says, "The American scientific community calls it the '1946 model miracle drug,' and doctors call it GOM."

Although the author presents himself as a scientist and even cites the names of many scientists in the article in a serious manner, in reality, this is a myth, if not a manufacturer's advertisement.

The truth is this: "Demerol is a... analgesic, sedative, and antispasmodic. Its analgesic effect is between morphine and codeine; however, it does not cause constipation, pupillary constriction, or respiratory depression, and it has a significant antispasmodic effect, making it particularly effective for visceral colic caused by smooth muscle spasms, which is its advantage. However, it is also addictive, although not as severe as morphine, which is its only drawback." In the 1945 edition of Zhang Changshao's Practical Pharmacology, its advantages and disadvantages were completely and faithfully introduced. The so-called "1946 model" miracle drug was thoroughly researched by scientists in 1945, even several years earlier. It is neither a "1946 model" nor a "God's Own" miracle drug. In China, Demerol is called Dolantin, which has been fashionable for three or four years. After Bayer's blitz marketing, most doctors have already blindly believed that this drug is "God's Own" miracle drug. Exposing the relationship between Demerol and Dolantin, Mr. Cruir's article does not have much impact on the Chinese people. Anyway, everyone is educated by pharmaceutical companies' promotional materials and instructions, so they unanimously say that Dolantin is not addictive. Therefore, they inject patients with ten or twenty shots, and the patients say this drug is really good and want more injections. The doctors say that since this drug is not addictive, they give them another ten or twenty shots. Later, many patients buy Dolantin themselves and continue to inject it. However, many doctors still believe Bayer's instructions, thinking that this is not addiction and that Dolantin will never be addictive. After the victory, Dolantin became an even more popular drug for quitting smoking, a savior for those in the underworld. Little do they know that opium and morphine addiction have secretly changed hands, replaced by imported Dolantin addiction, changing the soup but not the medicine.

The fact that Demerol or Dolantin can be addictive like morphine has long been reported by medical circles in various countries. Recently, Mr. Anslinger, the head of the U.S. Bureau of Narcotics, published many cases of Demerol addiction in the Journal of the American Medical Association on September 7 of this year, many of whom are doctors. Poor doctors, most of them were fooled by pharmaceutical companies' promotions and became victims of pharmaceutical advertising!

Demerol, or Dolantin, has long been classified as a narcotic by the U.S. Congress and has been subject to the sanctions and management of the Federal Narcotic Law along with morphine and cocaine since July 1, 1944. It is reported that the Narcotic Drugs Management Bureau of our country is also considering classifying this drug as a narcotic and managing it to prevent abuses.

Dolantin certainly has advantages over morphine, but it also has disadvantages. For example, its pain-relieving power is not as strong as morphine, nor is it as reliable. As for addictiveness, we should treat Dolantin and morphine equally, be equally vigilant, and avoid prolonged continuous use.

The truth about Demerol, or Dolantin, is that non-commercial scientists in the United States do not call it the "1946 model miracle drug," and non-quack doctors in the United States do not simply call it GOM. They recognize it as a substitute for morphine, but it has the same risk of addiction. When applying it, they remember that it is within the scope of federal narcotic drug management and use it carefully to avoid violating national law and harming patients.

We must know that: China has inferior and fake drugs, and foreign countries also have inferior and fake drugs; China has deceptive advertisements, and foreign countries also have deceptive... China has unprincipled scientists and doctors, and mercenary merchants do improper advertising and promotion, and foreign countries also have the same, the same. Let us discard this inferiority complex—

Chinese goods are not good,

Foreign goods must be better;

Chinese articles are not credible,

Foreign articles must be reliable;

Even the foreign moon

Is more beautiful than the Chinese one.

### A Discussion on Gynecological Diseases

— Tang Shuzhi

Chinese women often avoid seeking medical treatment for gynecological diseases, and only when they reach a serious stage do they reluctantly seek medical attention, which often leads to irreversible cases. The author will provide a simple introduction to the most important gynecological diseases, so that patients are aware of the dangers and avoid losing the opportunity for early treatment.

(1) Cancer: Cancer is most common in the elderly and middle-aged (over 35 years old). Cervical cancer is the most common. This disease has no special symptoms or pain in its early stages because the cervix itself lacks pain nerves. By the time symptoms are discovered, such as increased leucorrhea or bleeding, the disease has become quite serious. Normal women only have slight leucorrhea before and after menstruation or during the mid-menstrual cycle (ovulation period). If increased leucorrhea is found at other times, or if women who have stopped menstruating suddenly bleed or have leucorrhea, they must seek medical attention immediately. If waiting for heavy bleeding or abdominal pain, the good opportunity for early treatment has been lost. Because in the first stage of cervical cancer, those who can survive for more than five years can account for 70%, the second stage drops to 40%, and the third stage is only 15% to 25%; as for the fourth stage, even if encountering a famous doctor, they will be helpless. According to statistics of general outpatient cases, only 10% of cervical cancer patients are in the early stage, and the remaining several tens of percent wait until the cervix is ulcerated, bleeding heavily, or spread to other parts, causing unbearable pain, before seeking medical attention. It is said that the reason for delaying medical treatment is due to the misconception of "nine out of ten women have leucorrhea"; and bleeding, because menstruation comes every month, is a common occurrence, and they fail to take it as a warning, and because there is no pain in the early stages, they often ignore it. The seriousness of cervical cancer is such that we should do our best to take effective preventive measures. If there is leucorrhea usually (mostly caused by cervicitis), medical attention should be sought immediately. If procrastinating, not only is chronic inflammation difficult to treat, but cervical cancer may also follow. Although the direct cause of cervical cancer is still not fully understood, chronic cervicitis is related to the occurrence of cancer. Although cervical cancer is more common in parous women, unmarried women can also develop this disease, so it is important to pay attention. Therefore, whether unmarried or married, if there is a lot of leucorrhea, medical attention should be sought as soon as possible. And those who are 30 years old or older should have a gynecological examination every six months or a year, because although there are no special symptoms in the early stage of cancer, this period is quite long (lasting for several months). Missing this period will reduce the effectiveness of treatment.

(2) Tumor Diseases: 1. Uterine Leiomyoma: This type of tumor is more common in middle-aged women, and most common in unmarried women. (It is said that if you do not have children, you will develop a tumor). Its main symptoms are irregular menstruation, heavy flow, prolonged bleeding period, or shortened cycle. When the tumor is small, it must be diagnosed through vaginal examination. If it is slightly larger, a hard mass can be felt on the lower abdomen. Once this tumor is diagnosed, it must be removed as soon as possible, otherwise, not only will there be difficulties in the removal surgery after a long time, but other complications such as turning into cancer will also easily occur.

2. Ovarian Cyst (commonly known as water tumor): This tumor is more common in middle-aged and young people. When the tumor is small, there are no symptoms. It rises from the lower abdomen when it is slightly larger. It can grow to weigh dozens of pounds, making the abdomen as big as a drum. Its common complication is torsion of the tumor pedicle, or acute abdominal pain, accompanied by vomiting, etc., which must be removed immediately. Other common complications are adhesion to the intestines, inflammation, or turning into cancer after a long time. In short: Although the tumor is benign, once diagnosed, it must be removed as soon as possible, which is the best strategy.

(3) Salpingitis or Fallopian Tube Inflammation: The pathogen is mostly caused by the invasion of gonococci into the reproductive tract. Early symptoms include increased leucorrhea, initially thin and later thick. Or pain during urination or abdominal pain and fever. Once discovered in the acute phase, absolute rest and treatment with sulfa drugs or penicillin must be used. It gradually becomes chronic inflammation. It is easy to recur before and after menstruation, leading to fallopian tube blockage, which is a major cause of infertility. According to men transmitting this disease to women, they can still have hope of restoring reproductive ability after being cured, while in women, if not treated properly in the acute phase, their reproductive ability will be lost as a result.

(4) Menstrual Irregularities: If endocrine is unbalanced during development, menstrual irregularities often occur. Therefore, during the developmental period, it is important to have a rich diet and pay attention to hygiene. However, in middle-aged women, attention should be paid to whether there are tumors or cancer. There are also menstrual irregularities during menopause. However, cancer occurs very often during this period, so you cannot be too careful.

(5) Infertility: There are many causes of infertility, and the biggest main causes are incomplete development or fallopian tube obstruction. Whenever there is infertility, the male should also undergo a detailed examination by a doctor. The most important thing is to test the quality of the sperm and its activity.

### The Battle Between Humans and Germs (9)

— Excerpted from "Infectious Disease Management" by Qiao Shumin

2. Transmission Routes

The transmission routes of infectious diseases vary, mainly including direct or indirect contact transmission, respiratory transmission, gastrointestinal transmission, and insect transmission. The way to suppress it is to cut off its routes, which can be discussed in terms of disinfection and the eradication of harmful insects and animals. (7) Disinfection——Disinfection is the method of killing pathogenic microorganisms, and it is the key to cutting off the transmission route.

A. Disinfection Regarding Infectious Disease Patients:

(1) Continuous Disinfection——During the course of the disease, continuous disinfection of all excretions, sputum, pollutants, and items that may be contaminated is the fundamental way to suppress transmission.

(2) Terminal Disinfection——After the infectious disease patient recovers, dies, or moves away, disinfecting all items inside that may be contaminated is called terminal disinfection. In fact, if continuous disinfection can be done thoroughly, terminal disinfection is not necessary.

B. Disinfection Regarding Public Supplies: Disinfection of daily necessities such as milk, drinks, food, tableware, toothbrushes, towels, and the air in public places is also important, especially during the epidemic of infectious diseases.

B. Disinfection Methods——When we implement disinfection, we should first understand the nature of the pathogens and the transmission routes. Although there are many disinfection methods, they must be used properly to be effective. We must not blindly rely on the function of disinfectants.

8. Natural Disinfection Methods——Nature has a strong disinfection power, but it is inconvenient to use in daily life. If we can find a way to use it, the cost will be the lowest.

(1) Sunlight——The ultraviolet rays, blue-violet rays, and heat rays in sunlight all have bactericidal power. The magnitude of its bactericidal power is always proportional to the intensity of the light and the duration of exposure. Items such as books used by patients, which are not suitable for disinfection by other methods, can be used with this method. Expose them to strong sunlight for one or two hours in each place.

Ultraviolet rays are now used for air disinfection and are quite effective.

(2) Drying——Absolute drying is enough to destroy general bacteria. However, the dryness of various bacteria varies under various conditions, and the time required for sterilization varies.

(3) Dilution——Gastrointestinal bacteria can also be killed after a high degree of dilution.

(4) Decomposition——When feces decompose, bacteria can be killed.

B. Physical Disinfection Methods——Light, electricity, and heat can all be used for disinfection. However, in practice, "heat" is mainly used. Heat is divided into dry heat and wet heat:

(1) Dry Heat

(1) Incineration——This is one of the best and most reliable disinfection methods. All not very valuable waste that can be burned should be disposed of by incineration.

(2) Dry Hot Air——The penetrating power of dry hot air is weak, and the temperature needs to reach 150 degrees Celsius or more and last for one hour to kill bacteria with spores. At this high temperature, there is damage to the fibers of fabrics, so it is no longer very common. It is only used for disinfecting leather books and other items that are afraid of water and glassware.

(2) Wet Heat

(1) Boiling——This is a simple, easy, and most suitable disinfection method. Generally, boiling for five minutes can kill most bacteria with spores. However, killing tubercle bacilli and anthrax bacteria takes a little longer. In general, beverages and food should be disinfected by this method, but for the poison of milk, in order to preserve the nutritional value in it, the boiling method is often not used, but the Pasteurization method is used. Even if every part of the milk is heated to 143.5 degrees Fahrenheit and lasts for 30 minutes to eliminate the pathogenic bacteria contained in it; or heated to 160 degrees Fahrenheit for 15 minutes and then quickly cooled, it is also possible.

(2) Steam——The penetrating power of steam heat is stronger, especially when there is high pressure. When the pressure is increased, the heat also increases accordingly. Nowadays, general disinfection devices all use this steam heat.

(9) Chemical Disinfection Methods——Chemical disinfection is not very reliable and is mostly dangerous. It is only limited to cases where heat disinfection methods cannot be used. Common disinfectants include the following dozen or so types:

(1) Lime——This is the most economical disinfectant, but it must be unslaked lime to be effective. If used to disinfect feces, take an equal amount of lime and mix it with the feces. Disinfection is completed after two hours. If used as a common disinfectant, take one part of lime, mix it with two parts of clean water, and then pour it into five times the amount of water to make a lime milk disinfectant.

(2) Bleaching Powder——This is a compound of chlorine and lime. It should be stored in a closed container to prevent the loss of chlorine. General bleaching powder can contain 30% chlorine. Mix one pound of bleaching powder with two gallons of water to make a disinfectant that is easy to use. It can be used to disinfect feces, urine, phlegm, and nasal mucus (mix with an equal amount of disinfectant and let stand for one hour). Bleaching powder is also convenient to use for drinking water disinfection. Generally, adding about 1.5 parts per million of chlorine to the water is effective, depending on the clarity of the water.

(3) Mercuric Chloride——This agent has a strong bactericidal power. A 1/1000 solution is enough to kill general bacteria within half an hour, and a 2/1000 solution is enough to kill bacteria with spores. However, this agent easily combines with proteins, so it cannot be used to disinfect feces, phlegm, etc. Also, this substance is very poisonous and should not be used to disinfect tableware.

In addition to mercuric chloride, mercury compounds also include Mercurochrome, which is commonly used in general clinics. Its effectiveness is very low and unreliable.

(4) Carbolic Acid

(5) Lysol

(6) Potassium Permanganate——A 5% solution has bactericidal power. However, the price is relatively high, so it should only be used for small-scale disinfection of well water, food, and tableware.

(7) Soap——The bactericidal power of general soap is very weak, but when it is scrubbed with hot water to form a foam film, it also has the function of removing bacteria.

(8) Alcohol——The bactericidal power of alcohol is not very strong. A 50% to 70% solution is most effective. Too concentrated or too dilute is not good.

Whooping Cough Serum Explained

Antipertussis rabbit serum has various products, some of which are antitoxic and some contain antibacterial ingredients. The latter is more effective.

At the end of last year, Bradford and Day of the Department of Pediatrics at the University of Rochester in the United States reported that streptomycin is very effective for whooping cough bacillus infection in mice. Of the 20 mice infected with this bacillus, 9 died without treatment, and the mortality rate was nearly 50%. On the other hand, in the 20 mice treated with streptomycin, only one died, that is, the mortality rate was 5%, only one-tenth of the mortality rate of the untreated group. The university is currently testing this drug on clinical cases. If the same satisfactory results can be obtained, then in addition to serum, whooping cough will have another special prize.

We should note that Penicillin has no therapeutic effect on whooping cough, but it may have a good effect on complications such as pneumonia during the course of whooping cough. There is a current trend of using Aerosol solutions of streptomycin, vaporizing it and having the patient inhale deeply, which can eliminate the bacteria in the lungs.

Spring and Autumn

### Rabbit

— Zhang Qiqu

I never had any particular fondness for small animals. Apart from those repulsive caterpillars, I'm willing to keep any animal, given the opportunity.

During the war, I served in Shan County, near the Yellow River. The riverbank's sandy ground was dug up by the National Army to create many machine gun positions and trenches. Initially, the intention was to engage in a bloody battle with the enemy here. However, the enemy never crossed the river at this location. Eventually, the trenches were overgrown with weeds, becoming a playground for foxes and rabbits.

Some colleagues who enjoyed hunting would often take advantage of "air raid alerts" to catch wild rabbits. But due to a lack of good tools and deep resolve, they never managed to catch a single one.

One day, a colleague suddenly brought back a snow-white rabbit, claiming that he had personally caught it at Taiyang Ferry. Everyone excitedly and enviously gathered around, admiring the rabbit while inquiring about the capture process. Some suggested slaughtering it to accompany their drinks, while others proposed keeping it to find a female mate (this one was supposedly male) so they could breed rabbits and sell them in the future, or at least have the skins for everyone to get a pair of fur-lined gloves. Finally, amid the various opinions, the director stepped in and concluded: "One rabbit isn't enough for everyone to eat, and it's troublesome to raise. Besides, these things aren't clean and urinate everywhere. If the yard is filled with rabbit urine and rabbit droppings, what kind of image would it project when visitors come to inspect?" The director's opinion was certainly brilliant, but our organization was quite democratic. The director's words weren't a holy decree, and other opinions were still voiced and seconded.

As more and more opinions were offered, the disputes deepened. The colleague who caught the rabbit had already achieved his goal of showing off and had long retreated from the discussion of how to deal with the rabbit. As for the unfortunate creature, it was like a prisoner awaiting execution, a cotton-like ball huddled in the darkest corner under the bed, as if it had already foreseen that humans would never treat it kindly. So, no matter how you poked it with a bamboo pole or tempted it with vegetable leaves, it remained resolute and unresponsive. This dispute was temporarily alleviated due to its stubbornness.

The next day, my colleagues went out to work, and I was on duty for purchasing, staying behind.

After arranging the vegetables, I moved a deck chair outside and leisurely read the day's newspaper. Accidentally looking back, I suddenly saw that the little creature had secretly sneaked out of the dormitory. It was so cautious, wary of its enemies. Its ruby-red eyes were wide open, and its long, furry ears were listening everywhere for any sounds of hostility. Its two short, furry front legs barely moved an inch before its rear end quickly twitched. My newspaper unintentionally made a slight noise, and it twitched several times, running back to the dormitory. I felt quite ashamed. It wasn't that I particularly sympathized with the weak, but I truly felt that humans were too harsh on it! There was no reason for it to approach or trust us, with no intention of harming it.

The second time it came out, I did my best to control myself, even reducing my breathing to the minimum to avoid making it feel uneasy. I let it gradually explore, pass through the courtyard, and reach the kitchen door, where some discarded vegetable leaves lay. The cook didn't pay attention to these. In his eyes, this piece of long white fur was just something the gentlemen bought as a treat, like beef, vegetables, and other ingredients, all raw materials for cooking. He neither found it novel nor repulsive, and continued his work as usual, throwing out the radish tops he needed to discard from the window. But the timid rabbit didn't understand the thrower's intention, and immediately fled away as fast as it could, as if escaping a bomb. But it only ran halfway before slowing down. From then on, it considered the area near the kitchen door a danger zone and dared not go there again. So it moved along the wall, looking for other opportunities to solve its livelihood problems. But the cleaning movement had long since removed those plants that could serve as snacks for herbivorous animals.

It considered what it could eat to be dangerous and dared not approach it, starving itself while trying to find delicious things in a hopeless garden. It was both laughable and pitiable. After a long time, it seemed to be unbearably hungry, and I really couldn't bear it anymore. So I got up quietly—although it was quietly, it still frightened it, causing it to flee to the dormitory door. Now, the dormitory had become its refuge—I went to the kitchen, picked some fresh vegetable leaves and a piece of snow-white radish, and sat back in the deck chair, displaying my good things to it, tempting it to come and enjoy them.

But it seemed to have deep-seated prejudices against humans, or perhaps its eyes had a problem, only able to smell with its nose and not see with its eyes. No matter how I showed off, it simply ignored me.

After a while, seeing that it was ineffective, I couldn't bother to serve it anymore. So I threw the vegetable leaves and radish at the door and continued to read my newspaper, ignoring it.

After some time, I accidentally looked up and found it chewing on a root of the vegetable near the ditch. After that, it also walked around, taking a tour, seemingly planning to stay for a long time. It no longer harbored the same hostility towards me and the cook, the only two humans, as it had in the past, although it still timidly kept an eye on our expressions, showing a pitiful appearance like a new student entering school. But it was very different from the trembling state it had been in when it first arrived yesterday. However, in the evening, when the large group of people returned from work outside, it had to return to the place it had taken refuge in yesterday to mutter to itself.

For several days, people left and it came out, people returned and it went in, and it was all peaceful. In fact, people were no longer as enthusiastic about it as they had been when it first arrived. And because it had started using my bunk as a refuge, and later my box frame as a lodging place, I felt as if there was a connection between us and gradually regarded myself as its protector. I was happy that it was quite frugal, only needing a little grass and roots to be satisfied. Moreover, the place it lived in was never as dirty and smelly as we often see in rabbit cages. On the contrary, it was very concerned about hygiene, going to the latrine to urinate and defecate, without needing anyone to bring it a chamber pot. It also didn't have selfish habits, never intending to hide leftover radish tops to enjoy tomorrow. Although it was so cowardly that almost all animals in the world could bully it, it was never pessimistic, still solemnly, cautiously, and frankly having a pure and peaceful soul like a hermit. When it rested, it was also like an experienced elder, crouching under the porch in the sun. It didn't chant Amitabha like a hypocritical cat, but it was indeed fasting and eating vegetarian food, being quiet and inactive. Given its status, it was not suitable to live on a battlefield of killing and war or in a city of sensual pleasures. It was only fit to be among flower beds and lawns, among artificial mountains and lake rocks, as a companion of bees and butterflies, living a lifetime of peaceful and tranquil life.

It was so sincere, but not at all unintelligent. Its pair of long ears were always high and clear, occasionally detecting wind sounds, checking left and right, front and back. When it discovered a potential danger, it had already "preserved itself wisely" without alarming anyone, secretly slipping away. If the enemy was too harsh, relentlessly pursuing it, or there was no way to escape, or it predicted that the enemy's speed of advance was faster than its own, then it also knew how to be angry, to resist and condemn. However, its anger was polite, and its resistance was moral. It was unwilling to use hidden arrows, ambushes, or retaliatory attacks, and certainly would not use secret weapons like atomic bombs, but used its coarse and plain hind legs to make a "pat pat" sound on the ground to warn the enemy: "Don't go too far, leave some room to accumulate virtue for your descendants!"

This kind of ancient and benevolent resistance often had results. Because the enemies it encountered were not truly mortal enemies. Sometimes it was the mischievous children of the neighbors, sometimes it was just that people were doing something unrelated and startled it.

Only once did its ridiculous resistance fail.

An air raid alert came, and people had all fled far away to the suburbs. The yard was as quiet as a wilderness. Because I was sick, I sat on the bed, listening to the sound of the plane, hoping to be spared. It was happily running around in the yard, as if it had returned to its hometown. Soon, enemy planes were overhead. My mood became more tense, but it remained leisurely. After a while, a bomb exploded in the distance. It suddenly startled but did not hide, only constantly waving its long ears, quietly observing the truth of the situation. Soon, another bomb exploded, the sound closer. It panicked, fleeing to the wall. But it was useless, the sound of the bomb becoming louder and closer. It ran around everywhere, its hind legs desperately pounding the ground, making sounds of righteousness. Clearly, it had fallen into extreme panic, anger, and terror, and I was more terrified than it. Immediately, disregarding everything, I rushed out the door and jumped into a single-person air raid shelter that looked like a dry well. I don't know if it was because I was selfish or because it didn't understand human language, but I really didn't have time to greet it at the time. I just tensely looked up at the actions of the enemy plane in the air raid shelter. Finally, the bomb came to our yard.

It could be said to be lucky that I had jumped into the air raid shelter in time and was not harmed at all. It could also be said to be unfortunate that a bomb destroyed most of our office buildings. What was even more unfortunate was that the loyal and admirable rabbit had become the only martyr. What was even more regrettable was that when compiling the list of losses, it was impossible to include it. Like it, it can be said to have been born in sorrow, grown up in sorrow, and died in sorrow.

### Magnolia (Oil Painting)

— Frans Oerder

### Notes on Viewing Paintings

— Chang Renxia

In current Chinese painting, the school of Xu Beihong injects Western painting methods, while the school of Gao Jianfu injects Japanese painting methods. Due to the influence of foreign painting methods, a new posture has formed in the current stage of Chinese art, differing from traditional conservatives, and thus attracting two different arguments of support and opposition. But as seen by the far-sighted, with the change of the times, changes in art are also inevitable. Chinese painting underwent the greatest changes between the Han and Tang dynasties, all influenced by foreign countries. Although the Song and Yuan dynasties mostly imitated the law, their spirit and appearance were quite different. In modern times, Lang Shining had already opened the end of injecting Western painting methods into Chinese art, but with the current study of Western painting becoming more prevalent, the contamination of Chinese painting by Western winds is becoming more and more intense.

I very much agree with being able to use new painting methods to supplement the shortcomings of old Chinese painting methods. Of course, the advantages of old painting methods should also be diligently inherited. Creating our nation's new art by combining the advantages of world art is precisely the responsibility that Chinese people should bear now. In old painting methods, especially in figure painting, more emphasis is placed on interest and not on resemblance, so that portraits are often stiff and monotonous, becoming something detached from reality. Now, people who have studied Western painting to paint figures, if their skills are quite accomplished, the figures are often lifelike in their expressions, which is very different from the old painting methods.

Recently, I saw the paintings of Mr. Sun Qingyang. Qingyang studied with Zhang Hongwei and Putilsky in his early years and is most proficient in perspective projection. With the foundation of Chinese painting's double-hook method and the techniques of Western painting's sketching, coupled with his keen mind and diligent efforts, he can integrate the strengths of both Chinese and Western styles, creating a rare new style. I especially love his paintings of figures and ladies. One painting of a lotus picker is "The boat moves, the lake is shimmering in autumn, greedy to see the young and trust the boat to flow; for no reason throwing lotus seeds across the water, remotely known by people to be half-day shy." The composition of the poem is symmetrical, and the lotus picker's face, folds of clothing, and fingers are all painted very beautifully. A "Boating" is a picture of Fan Li carrying Xi Shi to tour the Five Lakes, with mountains and rivers, lake light, winding banks, and distant peaks, which makes people feel far away. The former is a representative work of his using Western methods to write figures, and the latter is an excellent achievement of his using perspective to arrange the picture. In addition, he also has a picture of Shushan, writing a mountain of red peach blossoms full of the head, the spring water of the Shu River flows on the mountain, "the red flowers are easy to decline like the meaning of the Lang, the flowing water is endless like the worry of the Nong." The landscape also uses Western methods, creating a unique style, and is working hard to progress upward. It is still difficult to know how high it will develop in the future, but diligence leads to skill, and Qingyang's forever tireless spirit is what those who create new Chinese art should do.

### Homecoming Poem Records

— Lu Baihua

South Lake Water Chestnut

Gradually, the sharp mountain peak line is in sight, probably what is called "Xushan"! I miss the heroic spirit of Wu Zixu's expedition to Chu passing through here. The light clouds float lightly over the top of the mountain, like setting off the heroic posture of ancient heroes. The water here is beautiful and clear, spreading out smoothly. The car has arrived in Jiaxing.

At the side of the station, there are two relics that form a clever but thought-provoking contrast. On the one hand, the accumulated tombs stand with new monuments, engraved with the merits of those who became benevolent in the War of Resistance. On the other hand, reflecting the tragic situation of the remnants, the traces left by the enemy, the light smoke floating in the morning, touch our tragic situation in a robbery, and a deeper understanding that the militarists will eventually be destroyed, and justice will inevitably be extended. We China has many Wu Zixu!

Suddenly, outside the car window, they shouted to sell Nanhu water chestnuts, made into a plate shape with cattails, full of hornless water chestnuts. Everyone was scrambling to buy them, because this is our country's unique product. The water chestnut is hornless, and the entrance is really fresh, but it is quite expensive. A cattail plate costs two thousand yuan, and the small one costs five hundred yuan. It is said that buying them in Jiaxing city costs only half the price. This shows a corner of our market where we are trying to be clever. I could not avoid the common practice and bought a plate. Chewing the new taste of Nanhu, looking at the lake fields of Huanqiao, water chestnut is growing, and on the left is a green wave. I thought of a few words from the ancients in Yanyu Tower: "The wonderful thing is that the light smoke拂渚, when the mountain rain is about to come, fishing boats and wine barges, are vaguely breaking through the fog." I didn't have the opportunity to take a look, and although there was no smoke and rain on the lake, the battle clouds on the earth were tense again, and it was not yet time to steal a glimpse.

Engraved monuments stand tall to bury loyal bones,

The forts still spit out the smoke of robbery;

Listen to the new taste of Nanhu being sold,

A green water chestnut field surrounds the bridge.

### Sonnet

— Yuan Wei

My thought, like the Peng bird of the North Sea,

"Ascends ninety thousand miles by swirling wind";

Stuck out from the low and humble nest on the ground,

Leaving me to travel the vast heavenly bodies.

Because I heard that Chang'e lived in the moon,

It chose the first place to visit;

But there was only a relic of the volcano,

No sign of life, too barren!

So it stepped on the road to the sun,

Seeing the infinite flames, too crazy;

One constellation to another constellation,

The harvest of travel made it disappointed.

Finally, still on this piece of land,

It found its home—your heart.

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood 86

— Ye Jingfeng

Walking along this wall is indeed more dangerous, but this open space is too wide, and I want to look at the barracks behind from the jungle, but my eyesight is not enough, and I didn’t bring a telescope. What is the benefit of leaning on the jungle? Moreover, when running across this ten-zhang-wide open space, the target is too obvious. If I reveal my figure, wouldn’t all previous efforts be wasted? At the same time, I don’t want to delay the time and turn back; I will go through the horizontal jungle. But when I thought of what my teacher had said before, "To observe the enemy's situation, if you cannot get close, you must seek to reach the saturation distance." The so-called "saturation distance" refers to the meaning of just being able to break away from the enemy's "alert boundary", and I can still make long-distance observations. Moreover, Tiger Brother's eyesight is extremely strong, and he can also observe subtle details at night, which is equivalent to a telescope.

Thinking of this, I decided to follow Tiger Brother's opinion and riskily cross this open space. Tiger Brother got his consent and immediately leaned over, like an arrow from a bow, and ran over like a wisp of smoke. Five or six zhang away, I saw his figure, like a civet cat, plunged into the shroud of the vast night. After waiting for about three or two minutes, there was no movement. I also leaned over and ran over as quickly as possible. I quietly sent a greeting password, and we gathered together again. While panting, I glanced at it and saw that the jungle here was exactly the same as the arrangement in front. Therefore, I realized that this must be the easternmost boundary of the forbidden area; outside this jungle, there must be a wide road, and outside the road must be a belt of stone walls.

Just as we knew that our panting had just settled down, we were hiding faintly along the jungle, one in front and one behind, walking north, when Tiger Brother suddenly turned around and gave a guard gesture. I hurried forward two steps and squatted down. I was about to ask him, but I had already heard people and dogs barking not far away. At that moment, I pulled Tiger Brother and drilled into the jungle,穿了過去. Sure enough, everything here was just as I had guessed; the road, and the stone wall.

"They're coming," I was lying on the ground, listening intently, and Tiger Brother 附　 my ear　告着, "It's that set again, ... only thirty or forty yards away!"

There is no room for hesitation here for even half a second, and a decision must be made immediately. I gave Tiger Brother a gesture, then leaned over and stepped over the road, took a step to the wall, put my hand on the wall, and looked slightly outside the wall. Seeing that I could still get a foothold, I slipped down. Tiger Brother also followed and crossed the wall. Fortunately, outside the wall here, there is also a slope like the one in the south, and a moat-like stream. Outside the stream, it is vast, presumably a field. I hurried to moisten my fingers, stretched them over my head, and measured the wind direction, knowing that we were in the downwind direction. But under this dull air pressure, where is the wind? It's just some sluggish flow of air.

We could have hid in the jungle to avoid the enemy, so why did we have to cross the stone wall? This was entirely to avoid the dog. After all, there is a six- or seven-foot-high stone wall隔了一層, even if the dog's sense of smell is厲害, the human body's smell can also be isolated somewhat, and it is still downwind. The worrying point is that the patrol inside is much tighter than I had estimated; because it was only a few minutes past eight o'clock, and the previous person had gone north less than half an hour ago, and this one was patrolling south again, then, on average, there would be a round of patrols every half hour. Maybe it's a kind of shuttle double哨? That is to say, two people start from the same place, go in opposite directions, and each绕 one circle, and can return to the station at the same time. This is just a guess of hope.

### Magazines

— Shaofu

Amid the soaring prices, the struggle of the weak publishing industry is truly a heart-wrenching and heroic scene. They must both survive and take care of readers, and it is difficult for non-insiders to understand their hardships.

Despite the fact that the environment is so bad, Shanghai's publishing industry still has amazing results, such as the "See Hear" and "Shanghai Culture" 期刋 is an example. They are serious in their attitude, serious in their work, and it is really exciting.

Regarding "See Hear", I have introduced it before. I am worried that it will be out of date, and now it is still inevitable. In fact, it should have been published as a semi-monthly at the beginning. After ten periods, when there are enough people and the scale is complete, it will not become a problem.

"Shanghai Culture" is worthy of being a very weighty magazine in terms of both content and form. It is progressing one issue at a time, and it will become a good friend of the reading community. Taking the eighth issue as an example, "A Detailed Account of Mr. Yu Dafu's Martyrdom" and the record of the "Symposium on Japanese Issues" are both extremely valuable and rare articles.

Shanghai is a paper-obsessed and gold-obsessed place. To be honest, most people have no intention of reading, especially these two magazines, which are above the level and not popular. That is the phenomenon, 自在意中. Therefore, I would like to contribute a little advice to their presenters, develop inland, and issue with inland as the focus, because inland readers are culturally hungry and desperately need spiritual food.

### France's Zhaojun's Lament

The number of American expeditionary soldiers marrying local foreign women is not small in today's war. The romantic affairs of French women have been famous throughout history. There are also many American soldiers who made lifelong alliances with local women in France. These women are not entirely French, but also Belgian, Polish, Czech, Dutch, and other countries, who came here to live to escape the war.

For the sake of proper planning, the French authorities do not want the brides who married American soldiers to flow around like mercury. Before they leave the country, they gather them together and send them to a charitable concentration camp in Orcher, near Paris, for centralized management. Therefore, after marrying American soldiers, they first encounter a soft ban life like a bird entering a cage, replacing the honeymoon trip of love with each other, which is really a big disappointment!

Some women are happy to temporarily endure the pain of soft detention because of their deep love and firm love. But there are also those who temporarily change their minds at the last minute. When they are in a temporary concentration camp outside Paris, many American husbands give comfort and encouragement along the way, and there are also those German prisoners of war who temporarily act as flower protectors, helping the brides to carry their wedding luggage.

On the first night after the 合　, they don't feel happy, not because of the hardship of material enjoyment, but really not used to the dull life in that cage! A woman named Jenny looked out from the wire mesh at the land scenery of her motherland and suddenly felt reluctant to leave, so she terminated the marriage contract at the last minute. Jenny is a French woman. She said: "Rather than going to the United States and then coming back, it is better to cut off a strand of affection with one knife now, which is much more pleasant!"

There is a woman named Mary, but she is different, she is very willing to live with her American husband until old age. In the past, she suffered from disease under the iron hooves of the German army and lived a life of imprisonment for several years. When they were liberated, she met her heroic partner. Now that she has been liberated and will soon be able to go to the gold dollar country of America, she will temporarily have to relive the old lesson of detention. Old grievances and new sorrows make her cry and laugh. There was a pistol hidden in Mary's small suitcase, and it was found and confiscated by the guards when she entered the concentration camp. At that time, she was crying like "a branch of pear blossoms with spring rain." She said: "This is a souvenir for my eye protection." Although the guards believed and sympathized, they still confiscated it in accordance with the regulations for safety.

### Beginning of Democracy

— A Grain of Rice

Who says the common people are useless? Just look at the councilors of Hangzhou City. There is actually a rickshaw puller named Zhao Tingxiu among them. From this, we can see that the common people have finally raised their heads and been liberated from the traditional concepts under the feudal system of thousands of years. Although that is only a small beginning, how can the current turbulent ocean rivers be formed without the original droplets of rain? Especially on the eve of the upcoming National Assembly, recalling the great hope of the Father of the Nation's will to "return power to the people" makes it shine like a moving sunrise.

We earnestly hope that this trend can spread to every local council in the country.

However, on the other hand, we still cannot help but eagerly hope for the general improvement of the people's education level. Otherwise, the participation of farmers and workers in politics will inevitably be merely a formality!

### Who Stole the Money?

— Jia Jin

Mr. H. Cady borrowed a long-term copy of "Industrial Engineering Chemistry" from a library in Wisconsin. The library stipulates that the borrowing time should not exceed one month, otherwise a fine of one dollar will be charged. Later, Mr. Cady traveled to Tennessee and did not return. His servant, Brown, received a reminder notice. When Cady returned home, he remembered this and gave Brown one U.S. dollar, instructing him to return the book quickly. A week later, the library sent another notice saying: "Although the book has been delivered from the post office, the fine draft has not been received." Cady asked Brown about this, saying: "What exactly happened?" Brown replied: "A week ago, because he thought the remittance was too small and the procedures were too complicated, he simply clipped the U.S. dollar between pages 53 and 54 of the book and sent it by mail." After speaking, he even presented the post office registered receipt as proof. Cady thought hard for a long time, unable to figure out who took the money. During his afternoon nap, he picked up a copy of Reader's Digest from the bookshelf. While reading, he suddenly realized that the money must have been taken by the servant Brown and not sent out. Smart readers: Can you guess what the Reader's Digest told him?

The answer will be revealed tomorrow

### Yin Rugeng Died Too Late

— Wu Shujiang

The great traitor of North China, Yin Rugeng, has been sentenced to death. In fact, the death of the traitor Yin was already determined in 1936. It can be said that he had a hard life, stirring up trouble for another ten years and doing a shameful career that disgraced his ancestors and humiliated his descendants.

In 1936, an anonymous "extraordinary woman," seeing the traitor Yin recognizing the enemy as his father, acting tyrannical, and oppressing the people, was extremely angry and decided to eliminate the traitor. At that time, Yin's security was tight, and there was no way to kill him. So, she condescended to befriend a certain captain of Yin's guards, secretly entering his room. Unfortunately, she failed to achieve her goal and was discovered. The extraordinary woman and the captain of the guards were both killed. Later, Yin added dozens of Japanese bodyguards to his entourage.

Ten years have passed, and the time for Yin's death has arrived. The extraordinary woman, if she is conscious in the afterlife, should also rest in peace?

Public School Staff Sigh

In the winter, the stomach is hungry. Take the rationed K-ration food box to fill the stomach. Open it again and again, but there is nothing to eat. Looking at "foreign goods," one is filled with joy and expresses this feeling.

Getting Ration K Once Opened, Meals in Sequence, Planning to Rebuild the Five Viscera, Oh dear, the Sugar Cookies, Cigarettes, and Tea are all Moldy. The product is five years old, sent from thousands of miles away. Public School Staff are unlucky, alas, the banknotes are four thousand five hundred kuai.

### A Wild Idea

— Wu You

Reading "The End of the World"

After reading the allegory "The End of the World" (published in the November 1st issue of this publication) under the lamp, I was extremely moved, almost unable to restrain myself. Thank goodness, "The End of the World" says that after that catastrophe, there was still a man with reproductive ability left in the world. It left a glimmer of hope for humanity. The "allegory" ends with a series of mysterious "..." which contains unspeakable words and boundless emotion and feelings! I couldn't help but be moved and fantasize about this series of mysterious "...", and even fell asleep while holding the newspaper. I had a dream all night:

From that time on, newspapers all over the world competed to publish news about that man in long headlines every day; magazines and publications in various countries also often used most of their pages to record it. The man's name was already known to every household in the world; in fact, that man had become a common hope, a sun, a god for all mankind.

That man attracted the attention of the whole world and became an unprecedented major point of contention in the international community! Everyone hoped to snatch that man, so that their own country and nation would not become extinct and could even control the world.

This situation continued, endlessly; there was a great sense of imminent danger. It made all mankind panic all day long, preparing to meet the unprecedented massacre that was about to come. At that time, Americans were naturally more anxious than people from other countries, because the only man with reproductive ability in the world belonged to the United States. In order to prevent problems before they happen, the United States had to stand up and call for the reorganization of a new international organization to specifically study and discuss this unprecedentedly serious world problem—how all mankind can share that man.

I don't know how many times of discussions, disputes, and crises that were just a breath away from turning into a complete falling out. Finally, an agreement was barely reached, and a "Great Charter for the Continuation of Human Life" was established.

Just as people were joyfully celebrating the new hope that this "Great Charter" brought to mankind, a new problem broke out! - Perhaps because those diplomats were all confused from arguing, the "Great Charter" actually omitted a section about the procedures for that man to travel to various countries in the future! Which should come first?

This new problem has once again brought international relations to a standstill! It suddenly made all mankind lose their color. After several rounds of negotiations, all sorts of methods were devised: some advocated following the geographical shape, starting from the United States, and proceeding sequentially around the world; some advocated following the order of large, medium, and small countries; some advocated going in alphabetical order of country names; all kinds of proposals were resolutely overturned by those countries ranked later. Finally, everyone had to come up with a method of deciding by drawing lots. But who should preside over the drawing of lots? This was another difficulty!

When the lottery date arrived, someone proposed a veto, saying that the organizer had malpractices. The two international groups still couldn't give way to each other, and some people were trying to reproduce humans by scientific methods. Everyone was confident and unafraid of each other.

Several years later, that one and only male god did not produce a second generation, and those dreaming scientists did not create scientific humans either.
