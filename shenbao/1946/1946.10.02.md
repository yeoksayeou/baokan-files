### The Air of Peace Again Turns Dim: The Chinese Communists Present a Memorandum to the Government, Clearly Using it as a Pretext to Shirk Military Responsibility

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 1st] The atmosphere for negotiations in the capital has been improving recently. Zhou Enlai's reply and his arrival date in Beijing are being closely watched by all parties. The government's forbearance in seeking peace and its active preparations for convening a conference have further increased the optimistic belief of those concerned about national affairs. However, a cloud suddenly appeared in the clear sky – the memorandum issued by the Communist Party. This document was signed by Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, Ye Jianying, Wu Yuzhang, Lu Dingyi, Deng Yingchao, and Li Weihan, and addressed to the representatives of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) for submission to Chairman Chiang. It was brought to Beijing by a special envoy from Shanghai on the night of the 30th. On the morning of the 1st, Dong Biwu and Wang Bingnan delivered a copy with the same content to Special Envoy Marshall and held talks. They left at 11:05 AM. At noon, Dong and Wang accepted Ambassador Stuart's invitation from the previous evening and informed him of the contents of the memorandum at the embassy. As for the copy addressed to the government representatives, it was also entrusted to someone for delivery to Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng. The content of this memorandum not only emphasizes the Zhangjiakou battle as an excuse, but also shifts all responsibility for the military actions of the past three months to the government. In the past, memoranda between the two sides were kept secret, but this time it is different, which is surprising to many. This correspondent asked the spokesperson of the Communist delegation on the evening of the 1st whether the release of the memorandum had been agreed to by the mediators in advance. The spokesperson said that the release of the memorandum was because the Communist Party attached special importance to the Zhangjiakou battle and wanted the public to fully understand the incident. The government has remained silent on the matter, as it does not want to deliberately create a rift while peace is gradually progressing. When this correspondent asked the mediator Marshall's spokesperson Connors, he did not express any opinion. However, it is widely believed that this may put the mediators in a more difficult position. In the past few days, Wang Bingnan's contacts with Marshall had shown signs of easing, and he emphasized the change in the Communist Party's attitude, which made Marshall optimistic about the prospects for peace. Now, the sudden release of this memorandum clearly indicates their intention to move towards a breakdown. According to sources familiar with the inside story, Zhou Enlai's meetings with various parties in Shanghai were mainly aimed at promoting the reunification of the Democratic League, because the Communist Party is unwilling to rashly participate in the informal five-person group meeting if it cannot control the Democratic League. This is the real reason for his internal discussions on general issues, and then exchanging views with Special Envoy Marshall. He left at 9:50 AM and went directly to the Executive Yuan to visit President Song, where they talked for about two hours. The ambassador then returned to the embassy. President Song immediately went to see the Chairman to report on the matter. In the afternoon at 5:00 PM, the ambassador's personal advisor, Fu Jingbo, visited President Song again and talked for 45 minutes. At 7:00 PM in the evening, the ambassador hosted a banquet at his residence for Special Envoy Marshall and his wife. Marshall met with Dong Biwu and Wang Bingnan from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM on the 1st, and then had several phone calls with the ambassador in the afternoon.

### Zhou Enlai Tells Reporters: The Key Lies in a Ceasefire; The Chinese Communists Demand a Halt to the Attack on Zhangyuan

[Our Report] Zhou Enlai met with Chinese and foreign reporters at his residence yesterday afternoon. About 100 people attended. Zhou said on the spot:

"It has been more than a month since I last met with you. As I expected, this period has passed in 'dragging on'. However, the civil war has become increasingly large and has now spread to the gateway of Zhangjiakou. The government has mobilized nine armies and is advancing on Chahar Province from three sides: Rehe, Hebei, and Suiyuan. The fighting began two days ago. Nie Rongzhen, Commander of the 'Liberated Area', has issued a memorandum to the Peiping Executive Headquarters. Subsequently, the Communist delegation has protested to Chairman Chiang. I myself have been ordered to submit a memorandum to Special Envoy Marshall. Ye Jianying, the Communist representative at the Peiping Executive Headquarters, has also submitted a memorandum to the government representatives. These protests and memoranda have clearly stated that if the government continues to attack, the Communist Party will have no choice but to believe that the government intends to destroy the peace negotiations and that all consequences and responsibilities should be borne by the Nationalist government.

Since the Japanese surrender, the Communist Party's attitude has always been to strive for peace, democracy, independence, and unity. Since Special Envoy Marshall participated in the mediation, the Communist Party's proposal has been to cease fire and handle everything in accordance with the PCC resolutions. The Communist Party's position has never changed. After the Double Tenth Agreement was issued last year, the war only stopped until January of this year, but the government was unwilling to cease fire in the Northeast, and the war broke out again. After March of this year, the war spread to the interior, and continues until today.

Now the government has attacked Zhangjiakou. Under these serious circumstances, the government not only does not want to cease fire, but will certainly have more demands after occupying Zhangjiakou.

Recently, Special Envoy Marshall proposed holding a three-person meeting and an informal five-person group at the same time. We believe that whether it is one meeting or two meetings, they are only formal issues. The key today is ceasefire, and stopping the attack on Chahar, centered on Zhangjiakou.

In terms of politics, since the PCC resolutions were passed, the government's comprehensive group and constitutional drafting group were still meeting in Chongqing in February, March, April, and May. It is the Kuomintang that is undermining the PCC. Chairman Chiang once publicly announced that the National Assembly would be postponed indefinitely until an agreement was reached, but in mid-July, he suddenly announced that the meeting would be held in mid-November without consulting with the various parties. Recently, he suddenly ordered all parties to list names, which is clearly what the democratic elements participating in the PCC do not want.

We believe that regardless of the three-person meeting, the five-person group, or the National Assembly, the key to everything is a ceasefire, and stopping the attack on Zhangjiakou. If the government stops attacking Zhangjiakou, there is still room for negotiation. Otherwise, the government is determined to destroy any possibility of peace and all responsibility should be borne by the Kuomintang."

### Peace Talks in Progress; Suspension of the Promulgation of the National Assembly Convocation Order

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 1st] The National Assembly Convocation Order was originally scheduled to be issued on the 2nd. According to a responsible person, the peace talks are currently in progress, and the Convocation Order will not be issued temporarily tomorrow and may be delayed for two weeks. According to an authoritative source, Chairman's August 14th statement submitted the draft constitution to the National Assembly in an effort to gather more perfect opinions from all parties. This refers to the fact that the draft constitution must be based on the principles agreed upon by the PCC meeting and the comprehensive group meeting. If the five-person group can proceed smoothly, the government will be able to exchange views with the various parties in order to reach a compromise.

### Claims of the Government Army Attacking Zhangjiakou Denied as Groundless; Troops in Northern Shanxi Join Forces in County

The reporter made a special visit to the Peiping Military Headquarters to inquire about the truth. According to the spokesperson's answer: there is no such thing. The report is based on speculation, and the claim that a general offensive order has been issued is even more unfounded.

After a fierce battle of one day and night, all the Communist forces were either killed or wounded, and all were captured, totaling about 2,000. At this point, the Communist forces' attempt to threaten Jining from western Chahar was completely shattered, and eastern Suiyuan was stabilized, making Suiyuan a complete province in North China. The local military and political authorities are stepping up their work, on the one hand actively appeasing the refugees and carrying out political work, and on the other hand reorganizing the troops to prepare for a counterattack against the Communist forces that may flee west from Zhangyuan.

### Chairman Encourages Shanghai Assembly Petition Delegation to Assist the Government in Construction; Attaches Importance to the Opinions of Public Opinion Organs

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 1st] Chairman Chiang met with representatives of the Shanghai Assembly Petition Delegation at his official residence at 5:00 PM on the 1st and expressed optimism about the current situation. It is said that once the situation improves and political unity is achieved, all problems will be solved naturally. In terms of the economic foundation, the current situation is better than before the war, and all aspects have improved compared to the past. He also said that the government will attach importance to the opinions put forward by public opinion organs and will instruct the relevant agencies to study and consider them separately. The government will immediately find ways to stop the impact of usury on production. The government has already handled all the suggestions made by the previous petition delegation that can be handled. Adjusting the exchange rate and exempting export taxes are examples. Finally, he encouraged the business community not to be discouraged and hoped that they would seek self-improvement in all aspects and assist the government in construction.

President Song was originally scheduled to meet with the petition delegation on the 1st, but due to work, the meeting was postponed to 4:00 PM on the 2nd. It is reported that the representatives of the petition delegation will have a longer period of discussion on the 2nd. When meeting with reporters, he also said that he will meet with the petition delegation on the 2nd to help solve the difficulties of industry and commerce. The schedule of the petition delegation on the 2nd is as follows: at 11:00 AM, they will go to the Executive Yuan to continue talks with Ministers Wang Yunwu and Yu Hongjun. In the afternoon, they will submit opinions to various agencies. At 4:00 PM, they will visit President Song. Some representatives plan to take a car back to Shanghai on the evening of the 2nd.

### Luo Qinghua Describes the Current Crisis of Industry and Commerce to the Chairman; Explains the Key Points of Each Request

When the petition delegation visited the Chairman, Xu Jiying explained the organization process and the mission of the delegation. Then, Luo Qinghua described in detail the current crisis of industry and commerce and the hopes for the government, saying: "At present, the situation of industry and commerce is the most difficult for industry, and legitimate commerce is also suffering from the oppression of usury, and deeply feels the pain of insufficient capital turnover. Some people despise the industrial and commercial crisis in Shanghai because Shanghai retailers have closed down. In fact, since the Anti-Japanese War, retailers have been unable to promote domestic products due to their high prices, and have changed to selling foreign goods and smuggled goods to maintain their business. This is not a good phenomenon. Secondly, the population of Shanghai has increased, and 4 million people are concentrated in the old concessions. On the surface, it seems prosperous, but in reality, the purchasing power is far less than before. It is strong on the outside and weak on the inside, which is not optimistic. In the past two months, there have been almost daily closures of factories. There are three reasons: first, the lack of funds and the exploitation of usury; second, the increase in wages and the increase in costs; and third, the low-price dumping of imported goods and surplus materials. In addition, there are some industrial and commercial industries that are in a state of living and dying, such as the knitting industry and the silk weaving industry. Due to the lack of funds, they stop work for almost two days out of three days. If the products are scarce, the cost will be expensive, and they will eventually run out of money. The morning industry also has this kind of pain, resulting in the phenomenon of goods being abandoned on the ground, which is heartbreaking. In terms of international trade, the current situation is the best opportunity for us to develop the international market, but due to exchange rate relations, the cost is not enough and it cannot be exported. Japan, under the support of MacArthur, is actively developing, which is infuriating and makes us deeply vigilant. If we cannot lay the foundation for international trade within one year, and the government can make significant sacrifices, it is hopeless to strive for the international market." Luo then explained the key points of each request made by the petition delegation, saying: "It has been a year since the end of the Anti-Japanese War, and the ports have been opened, and more and more foreign goods are coming. The government should change its wartime economic policy in the past, improve financial measures, strengthen the specialization of banks, strengthen the connection between finance and industry, strengthen the connection between the central and local governments, and launch production loans for agriculture, industry, and commerce at low interest rates, starting from increasing production incentives, to achieve the goal of contracting currency and balancing international payments." Finally, he explained the importance of the relationship between Shanghai and even the whole country, and hoped that the central and local governments could concentrate their efforts to work together. Then, the representatives spoke one by one. Xi Yushu hoped that the banks could be specialized, and that the national banks could relax the number of industrial and agricultural loans so that the industrial and commercial circles could get substantial benefits. He also pointed out that the government only focused on the work of takeover in the past, and did not pay attention to the suffering of industry and commerce, and there was no performance in the construction work. It is actually a "not eating eggs but eating chickens" method. Tao Baichuan stated the financial difficulties of the Shanghai Municipal Government. Although it has recently decided to increase two new taxes to carry out construction work, it is still insufficient. He hoped that the government could allocate half of the proceeds from the sale of the Shanghai takeover materials for the construction of Shanghai. Jin Runxiang mentioned the experience of the petition delegation coming to Beijing last time and hoped that the government could adopt and implement the points mentioned. Wang Xianqing explained that the interest rate on the four-way loan is nominally 5%, but with the addition of handling fees, etc., it is actually 10%. He hoped that the government would improve it. In addition, Yu Zuoqu, Wang Yansong, Xu Guomao, Yang Fusheng, and others also expressed their opinions. The Chairman answered them one by one, which lasted about 45 minutes before leaving at 5:45.

### Adjusting Exchange Rates and Exempting Export Taxes Still Hardly Rescues Industry and Commerce; Wu Tiecheng States That the Government Will Naturally Support Them

The petition delegation, after gathering at the Zhejiang Xingye Bank around 9:00 AM on the 1st, first went to the Central Party Headquarters, where they were received by Secretary-General Tiecheng and Minister Lifu. First, delegation leader Xu Jiting explained the mission and the current crisis facing industry and commerce, hoping the government could provide relief. Then, Jin Runxiang delivered a speech, strongly emphasizing the severity of the current economic crisis and the soaring prices, hoping the government could establish a definite economic policy and implement the points raised by the previous petition delegation to Nanjing. He stated that the government's adjustment of exchange rates and exemption of export taxes were still insufficient to save the faltering industry and commerce, and that factory closures still occurred frequently. He hoped the government would pay attention to this. Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng responded, saying that the government shared the same deep anxiety as the industrial and commercial sectors regarding the current economic crisis and would naturally find ways to support various industries and businesses. Subsequently, Luo Qinghua delivered a speech, first explaining the points that should be improved in the current economic policy, pointing out that the previous measures of tightening credit and inflating currency had led to a shrinking of production, while the door was wide open for foreign trade, allowing foreign goods to flood in, posing a great danger to the future of industry and commerce. This was not just a problem for Shanghai alone. Luo also explained the two suggestions proposed by the petition delegation, hoping the government could follow the precedent set after the January 28th Incident and establish an economic reconstruction committee in Shanghai, with President Song serving as chairman, and the mayor and chairman of the municipal council as vice-chairmen. He also requested the government to allocate half of the one trillion in materials received as war reparations as a special fund for the revitalization of Shanghai, as these materials were all the people's hard-earned wealth taken by the Japanese and should be returned to their rightful owners. Luo concluded with a loud appeal, saying that the situation of industry and commerce was so serious that it must not be allowed to suffer further damage and continue to shrink, leading to urban famine and unimaginable consequences. He deeply hoped that Secretary-General Wu, who had previously served as the mayor of Shanghai, could convey these opinions. Finally, Secretary-General Wu responded, saying that when he was the mayor of Shanghai, the municipal government was very capable of cooperating with the citizens. Shanghai was the economic center of the country, and to seek national economic revitalization, it was necessary to first ensure the stability of this important center. The government would naturally do its best to cooperate with industry and commerce.

After leaving the Central Party Headquarters, the petition delegation went to the Executive Yuan, intending to meet with President Song, but because Song was in discussions with Ambassador Stuart and Chuan Jingbo, they were instead received by Secretary-General Jiang Menglin, Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun, and Minister of Economy Wang. Xu Shenqing, Luo Qinghua, and others successively spoke, explaining the mission and the points that the industrial and commercial sectors of Shanghai hoped from the government. The talks concluded at 1:00 PM. At 3:00 PM, they visited Liang Hancao, Deputy Secretary-General of the Supreme National Defense Council, and departed after about 45 minutes.

### British Business Delegation Will Represent the Government to Express Respect to Our Country and Will Order Eggs, Silk, Etc.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 30th] A British business delegation, led by Sir Bowers, has departed on two special planes for a visit to China. The delegation consists of nine members and is under the order of the British government, carrying a message of greetings from the Minister of Commerce, Sir Cripps, to President Chiang. It is expected to stay in China for three months to study the development of trade between China and Britain and may order eggs, vegetables, oils, and silk from China. In addition, it is learned that Sir Cripps, before the departure of the delegation, sent a letter to the leader, Sir Bowers, stating: "Please convey to China, on behalf of the British government and people, the greatest respect, and wish them an unlimited future. The Chinese military and civilians have bravely resisted the invasion of the violent Japanese for the longest time and finally achieved the final victory, which makes Britain extremely admired. During the war, we paid close attention to it at all times. At this moment, looking forward to the close cooperation between China and Britain, a new era of expanding world trade will surely be opened. I believe that China and Britain will be in an important position in future world trade. Our industrial knowledge and industrial resources are sufficient to help China develop its national wealth and gradually improve the living standards of the Chinese people.

### Britain Donates Over 40,000 Tons of Bridge-Building Equipment to China

[Report from This Newspaper] In order to help promote domestic transportation in China, UNRRA recently shipped 42,300 tons of bridge-building equipment to China, with a value of 20 million British pounds, enough to build 904 bridges. This material is all donated by the United Kingdom. There are now many engineers, including two from Nevada, two from Denmark, and one American expert, who have made a special trip to Britain to learn bridge construction techniques, because this type of bridge is military in nature and different from ordinary bridges. After these bridges are built, they will be of great benefit to the transportation of relief supplies to the inland.

### Zhejiang's Special Product Output Sharply Reduced, Authorities Seek Revival

[Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 1st] Zhejiang Province's special products, such as silk, tea, cotton, and tung oil, are the largest. They suffered heavy losses during the war, resulting in a sharp decline in output, especially fresh cocoons. Tea has decreased from 400,000 dan before the war to 100,000 dan. Cotton and tung oil have also decreased by more than four-fifths, with annual output of only over 100,000 dan. In addition, increased costs, reduced sales, and restrictions on foreign exchange have led to production contraction and economic decline. Local people and the ruling authorities are now trying to revive the special products, first seeking to reach pre-war output, and then gradually improving them.

### Zhao Hengti Arrives in Hankou; Claims Hunan Disaster Can Be Overcome

[Report from This Newspaper, Hankou, 1st] Zhao Hengti, Speaker of the Hunan Provincial Assembly, arrived in Hankou yesterday and is scheduled to fly to Nanjing this afternoon. According to Zhao, with the assistance of all parties and the autumn harvest this year, the Hunan disaster can barely be overcome. However, most of the farmland has been abandoned, and the total harvest of the province is still less than 70%. Moreover, the people are in distress and have to sell new grains. Now, each stone (dan) is only sold for 4,000 yuan. The crisis of harming farmers is deeply worrying. This time, I am going to Nanjing to request the central government to allocate 10 billion yuan to purchase grain in Hunan Province to save the rural plight and to thank the people of Nanjing and Shanghai for their assistance.

### Developing Northeast Resources Presents a Once-in-a-Lifetime Opportunity; Mr. Zhang Yujiu's Remarks After Returning from Inspection

[Central News Agency, This City] The trade situation and economic conditions in the Northeast are of great concern to people in Shanghai. A reporter from the Central News Agency recently met with Mr. Zhang Yujiu, Director of the China Import and Export Trade Association and General Manager of the China Vegetable Oil Factory, who had just returned to Shanghai after a month-long inspection of the Northeast. According to him, the Northeast is rich in resources, and there are many emerging industries waiting to be developed. He believes that the key to economic development lies in the development of resources. Before the extraction of resources, a sufficient labor force is particularly needed. The Northeast certainly has favorable conditions for this. Since the recovery, the government has been working hard to manage and actively rectify the situation, making currency circulation, transportation, navigation, electricity, and shipping the current priorities. Regarding the long-pending issue of currency circulation, a solution has been found, and the Central Bank has announced a new exchange rate, which has been reported in various newspapers. During the military control period of the train, it is hoped that the train will be allocated for export goods to relieve the difficulties of businesses. If the Civil Aviation Administration opens up flights in addition to the Civil Aviation Administration, air transport will be smooth, and the special psychological can be dispelled. The issue of electricity is particularly important. No thick smoke is seen in Northeast factories. In the past, all electricity was supplied by the Yongji Small Manchurian Electric Factory, with a power generation capacity of 600,000 kilowatts. After repair, it can also reach 160,000 kilowatts. As for the issue of electricity passing through the CCP area, after consultation, it has been agreed that the factory will supply a portion of electricity to Harbin as an exchange condition, which has now been agreed upon. Electricity transmission will begin as soon as the power lines are laid. Transportation is the only factor in promoting trade. Yingkou, Huludao, and Qinhuangdao, the current three major seaports, can be reached by train, but there are few ships in the above-mentioned key locations, and the docks and warehouses have not been completed, resulting in soybeans, furs, etc. being piled up and unable to be transported into the customs as much as possible. Mr. Zhang continued: Although the authorities have reasonably allocated enemy and puppet factories to the central government, local governments, production bureaus, or private sectors according to their nature, as far as I have observed, those that have started work are only relying on the remaining raw materials on hand to maintain self-sufficiency. Normal operation and large-scale are very rare. If there is no overall planning, and production, capital, transportation, and sales are taken as the premise, once the raw materials are exhausted, the crisis is worrying. In the past, the enemy's grand plan was to match Northeast trade with the needs of the world and North China. Now that the Japanese vitality has not recovered and the political situation in Korea has not yet been incorporated into the norm, seizing the opportunity, expanding transportation, and strengthening development are once-in-a-lifetime opportunities. Britain, the United States, and Canada are short of soybeans, and North China is short of food. The annual output of soybeans in the customs can reach up to 6 million dan, and the remaining sorghum and millet can be exported to enrich the national treasury. In this way, the people's livelihood is favorable, and the government can also gain new vitality. He also solemnly stated that the Northeast production plan should be rebuilt quickly. The original technical personnel seem to be insufficient. Even MacArthur's supreme decision on the Far East to reduce the original 2 million Japanese population to 100,000, and now I heard that it will be reduced again to give us the opportunity to build ourselves, is admirable, but it is too far from the actual needs, we should catch up quickly, cooperate with the unfinished plan of the Japanese, and carry it forward to seize the world trade base, and hope that domestic industrial and commercial leaders will open their eyes and look at the Northeast, and then look at the Central Plains, it is like a drop in the ocean, a snail's land on the sea, let alone. If we can join hands to rise up and develop the Northeast, personal achievement, career development, and national prosperity are full of infinite new hopes.

### Taiwanese Japanese Publications to Cease Publication at Month's End

The Taiwanese Tribute Mission Arrived in Shanghai Last Night

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] The Taiwanese Tribute Mission is scheduled to leave Nanjing by train at 10:00 PM on the 1st for Shanghai and return to Taiwan.

[Report from This Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The Taiwan Restoration Tribute Mission hosted reporters at 5:00 PM on the 1st. According to reports: (1) Taiwanese compatriots have too high expectations for the motherland. The takeover work and current management are difficult to satisfy. However, after this mission came to Taiwan to severely punish corruption, the public sentiment has improved a lot. (2) The promotion of National Language education is progressing smoothly. Those over 30 years old have a good foundation in National Language, and those under 30 are working hard to learn. Generally, there is a high interest in learning National Language. When the Provincial Council of the Province meets in the first half of next year, it is expected to be in complete National Language. In addition, the Taiwan Provincial Government has ordered that all Japanese publications be discontinued from the 25th of this month (the anniversary of Taiwan's restoration). In the future, everything in Taiwan will gradually become consistent with the mainland.

Editorial

### The CCP's Memorandum

The CCP delegation's memorandum was delivered to the government representatives yesterday morning and forwarded to President Chiang, demanding that the government immediately cease all military action against Zhangjiakou and its surroundings, otherwise, it would declare a complete breakdown and blame all the serious consequences on the government. We are used to hearing the CCP's verbal propaganda, and we are also used to seeing the CCP's statements and propositions. There are no novel elements in this memorandum, so we are not surprised; we, the common people, have been yearning for domestic peace and unity day and night, and of course, we also hope that the CCP government will turn swords into plowshares and turn evil customs into peace. However, after reading the CCP's memorandum, we have a few thoughts:

First, who caused the recent three months of war? Who should be responsible? The January 10th truce order was thoroughly broken by the CCP because the CCP established its so-called "Democratic Allied Forces" in the Northeast to prevent the National Army from entering to restore sovereignty, so that the truce could not be achieved. Let's put this aside for the moment; even with the government's second truce order on June 7th, it was also because the CCP believed in the omnipotence of force, not only refusing to comply with the plan to unify and reorganize its party army and hand it over to the state, but also continuing to destroy transportation, use troops to create chaos, and attempt to expand its territory and seize cities. The CCP army's siege of Datong, with meticulous planning, has not been for a day, which is a well-known fact; but the CCP said in the memorandum: "The CCP's battle for Datong is only to obstruct the advance of the Shanxi Guan Hu army and belongs to the nature of relieving the siege." Who would believe this? Everyone understands that the recent three months of war started from the CCP's siege of Datong.

Second, the CCP's request for the government to immediately cease military action against Zhangjiakou does not need to be threatened with a "declaration of complete breakdown." Because the door to negotiations between the KMT and the CCP is still wide open. In the past, negotiations were stagnant in the dispute over "three" and "five"; but since President Chiang returned to Nanjing, he has still expressed generosity to the CCP with his original intention of loving peace, and has accepted the compromise of mediator General Marshall, advocating that the three-person group and the five-person committee be held at the same time, so that military and political issues can be resolved at the same time. If the CCP truly has the sincerity of peace, as long as the CCP representative Zhou Enlai returns to Nanjing immediately to resume negotiations, not only the war in Zhangjiakou can be quelled, but also swords can be turned into plowshares throughout the country.

In short, the people long for peace, and the government seeks peace. As long as the CCP has the sincerity to "seek peace," all problems can be easily resolved. Why does the CCP need to exaggerate its words and threaten with a "complete breakdown"? Our common people's nerves have already been very tense and can no longer be stimulated by the CCP's war of nerves.

### Deliberation on the Prohibition of Rickshaws

The Shanghai Municipal Government announced that it has been ordered to ban rickshaws, using a lottery method, expecting to complete the elimination in three years. This November, one-tenth of the rickshaws must be eliminated, including about 2,065 operating rickshaws and 630 private rickshaws. From the perspective of national dignity, we should support this policy.

Looking at the world, rickshaws are only found in Asia, and in Asia, the traces of rickshaws are gradually disappearing in countries with considerable status. For example, before the war, Japan was the place with the most rickshaws before it became a strong country. Once its national strength became strong, rickshaws disappeared. Travelers to Japan can only see a few rickshaws in Yokohama, and the rest of the cities such as Tokyo and Osaka are completely prohibited. Even in India under British rule, Mumbai has no rickshaws at all, Madras has few, and only Calcutta has a considerable number of rickshaws. Outside of India, there are still many rickshaws in countries that are still in colonial status, such as Myanmar, Malaysia, and Vietnam. Since China is an independent and large country, and it shoulders the heavy responsibility of stabilizing world peace in Asia, it should no longer retain this shameful characteristic of a colony. From an international perspective, we do not support China still having rickshaws forever.

From a humanitarian point of view, we also do not support the existence of rickshaws in China. People are born to eat, but there are many ways to eat. Pulling rickshaws, acting like cattle and horses, the existence of this system in society has invisibly deprived these laborers of the noble personality they should have in form, reduced the self-esteem of these many poor citizens, and actually weakened the spiritual strength of the country, thereby making the national strength not consolidated. Therefore, if China wants to become a country with the same status as Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, the reason for banning rickshaws is sufficient. Moreover, when rickshaw pullers are working, they run forward pulling the rickshaw, panting like cows, sweating profusely. In summer, they are baked by the scorching sun, and in winter, they are attacked by the cold wind. The climatic damage to their bodies is even more unnecessary to say. The country naturally has no need to preserve this inhuman way of life at the lower level. We have nothing to say about the government's ban on rickshaws in this regard.

What is worrying is that in today's period and situation, is it completely appropriate in terms of time to severely and immediately ban rickshaws? In today's post-war era, preventing unemployment is the most important issue for governments around the world. Britain, the United States, France, and other countries personally received a serious and indelible lesson from the national unemployment after the end of World War I. Therefore, even before the end of this war, they used all possible means to study how to reduce unemployment. Sure enough, thanks to this effort, at least at present, Allied countries such as Britain and the United States have not encountered any difficulties caused by unemployment. Their government authorities have rich experience in dealing with this problem. They know that an increase in the number of people in the country will make politics more complex and make the economy more vulnerable to recession.

On the contrary, all our measures, whether intentional or unintentional, seem to be working hard to create unemployment. Since the victory, only one year has passed, many institutions have been abolished, and countless unemployed people have been added. Many factories have closed down, and many more unemployed people have been added. Street vendors have been banned, and an unknown number of unemployed people have been created out of thin air. Now we are going to ban rickshaws across the country, which is a more widespread agitation of the anxiety of this vast group of laborers. China's political situation is now in such turmoil that it is appropriate to seek stability for a while, first get an opportunity to live and work in peace, and then seek progress. At this time, rushing to ban rickshaws across the country seems to be incompatible with the objective environment of politics.

It does not seem to be the most appropriate time to ban rickshaws today. Therefore, we hope that the administrative authorities can postpone it for the time being, or it is better to postpone it for the time being. If it must be done, then in the banning, all measures must be balanced and appropriate. Do not rush it too much, and do not punish it too severely, so that the spirit of these laborers will not be stimulated too much. Make sure that after the ban, their eating problem, although not completely settled, at least a part of it has a practical solution. The implementation of a good policy often has great difficulties. This is what we know. We hope that the government will adopt a solemn and stable method in order to gradually achieve this progressive state of "no rickshaws in China."

### International Cultural and Educational Cooperation

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization is about to convene in Paris. The United States Department of State, in preparation for participating in this international conference, specially convened the National Commission on Educational, Scientific and Cultural Affairs in Washington D.C. When President Truman received the members of the commission, he greatly praised and encouraged the cause of international cultural and educational cooperation, writing: "I believe that the contribution of the Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization to world peace will be no less than that of other organizations related to the United Nations. This organization will awaken our strength to strive for peace. When we understand the viewpoints of others and others understand ours, we will be able to engage in discussions, thereby discarding various differences. If we have no understanding, we have no peace; if we have no education, we have no peace..." It can be seen that regarding international cultural and educational cooperation, the United States, from President Truman down, pays close attention to it and places earnest expectations on it.

In the reconstruction of the world's peaceful order, indeed no effort is as fundamental as international cultural and educational cooperation. The reason for conflicts between countries lies in the lack of understanding between people; to increase mutual understanding between people, the key lies in enhancing international cultural and educational cooperation. This is a cultural issue, an educational issue. Humanity should understand that people live in various different cultural environments. While we should certainly improve the cultural standards of humanity, we must also remember that the formation of various cultural environments each has its historical background, and we must have the understanding and tolerance to accommodate other cultural lives. If we believe that our own cultural life is lofty and force others to conform to it, this turns into an abhorrent Kultur. This unpleasant name symbolizes the militarism of Prussia and the Nazism of Hitler in the past. The purpose of international cultural and educational cooperation is to promote understanding and cooperation between nations within the cultures of each nation. The reason why world peace is threatened is mainly that the cultural life of a certain nation, including its thoughts and behaviors, is imposed by force on people who do not belong to that nation. The German warlords did this, and the Japanese warlords did this as well. Mankind's awakening after two world wars should be sought in international cultural cooperation. This is why President Truman said when receiving members of the U.S. National Commission on Educational, Scientific and Cultural Affairs: "If we have no understanding, we have no peace; if we have no education, we have no peace."

The responsibility that China bears in international cultural and educational cooperation is arduous. We are an ancient country of culture, and although we may be relatively backward in science and technology, we originally had our treasures in spiritual culture. Since China's interaction with the world, the cultural heritage left by our wise ancestors, although some small parts of it have been introduced to the West, just fragments, the complete picture of our entire national culture is not yet well known to the world. Therefore, at this time, we should especially devote ourselves to the promotion of our national culture, so that the thoughts and doctrines of our ancestors such as Confucius and Mencius, like Aristotle, can also become a part of the world's cultural heritage, and increase the world's understanding of our country. Therefore, we should pay special attention to the position we occupy in international cultural and educational cooperation.

Because of this important relationship, and in view of the fact that the United States has a National Commission on Educational, Scientific and Cultural Affairs, we believe that when our country prepares to participate in international cultural and educational cooperation, we should also have a similar organization domestically. Regarding international cultural and educational cooperation, we know that this is the scope of the Ministry of Education's authority; however, since the Ministry of Education is an administrative agency, it seems that a National Commission on Educational, Scientific and Cultural Affairs similar to that of the United States should be established outside or under the Ministry of Education, jointly organized by the Academia Sinica, the Peking Academy, various famous universities, the Central Cultural Movement Committee, and other relevant parties such as museums, libraries, or scientific societies, to focus on participating in international cultural and educational cooperation as its main business. For example, regarding the establishment of a mathematics center by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in China, whether it should be located in Nanjing along with the capital or set up elsewhere, could be decided through discussions by this organization. International cultural and educational cooperation is not only related to educational administration, but also related to national policy everywhere.

In short, international cultural and educational cooperation is indeed a very important task. The position our country occupies in this work is particularly important, and others have particularly earnest expectations of us. Therefore, we should especially have excellent performance in participating in this work, in order to increase the world's understanding of us.

### New Embezzlement Discoveries in Hubei's Takeover Involve Wang Dongyuan and Two Former Ministers of Finance; Investigation Team from Nanjing and Jiangsu to Complete Work in Wuxi

[Our Newspaper Hankou 1st Dispatch] The Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi Area Investigation Team yesterday late at night released another report on Hubei Provincial Government's illegal takeover and handling of materials. They believe that former Chairman Wang Dongyuan, Minister of Finance Wu Songqing, and Director of the Hankou Alcohol Factory Shi Lingsheng, as well as Director of the Construction Department Tan Yuequan, cannot escape responsibility and should be thoroughly investigated and dealt with according to the law. The inside story of the case is recorded as follows: (1) Regarding the Provincial Government's Materials Takeover and Handling Committee: (A) It established a takeover agency without legal basis; (B) It privately handled a huge amount of taken over materials, totaling more than 30 batches. Without public bidding or legal procedures, only Wu Songqing, Zheng Nanxuan, and 10 others privately made decisions; (C) It gave a 20% kickback to the purchasing agencies, causing the state to lose at least 57 million yuan; (D) Purchasing stores were also given a 20% kickback, and more than 500,000 yuan in overcharged payments were found, and it is unknown into whose hands they fell; (E) The proceeds from the sale of materials were illegally used up, and a portion was secretly deposited in a bank to collect interest, and the deposit interest was privately transferred in violation of the contract; (F) A large amount of materials were missing during the handover. The main culprit, Section Chief Ye Jingxiong of the Secretariat, fled. The Provincial Government deliberately failed to thoroughly investigate, which is obviously intentional protection. (2) Regarding the Hankou Alcohol Factory, the director, Shi Lingsheng, took over more than 20 large and small factories and illegally sold a large amount of materials. Everything was not made public internally or externally, and the selling price of the materials was only half of the market price, enriching himself at the expense of the state, causing the state to lose at least 200 million yuan.

[Our Newspaper Suzhou 1st Dispatch] Fan Yusui, leader of the Nanjing-Suzhou Team of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Area Takeover Investigation Team, and committee members Wu Cangzhou, Du Guang'ao, Wu Zhenya, and others, led all team members to Wuxi the day before yesterday to begin their investigation, which is nearing completion. The team specially notified the local Enemy Property Suzhou Branch and other relevant agencies that they are scheduled to arrive in Suzhou on the 5th and ordered them to quickly prepare and provide detailed reports of all original registers, details of the takeover, and handling process for investigation. All takeover agencies in Suzhou are currently rushing to complete this overnight.

[Our Newspaper Guangzhou 1st Dispatch] The Guangdong-Guangxi Area Takeover Investigation Team recently learned that the Guangdong Good Relief Branch Fishing Industry General Office is suspected of embezzlement in the takeover of enemy fishing boats. It was found that the office was originally an affiliate of the Good Relief Branch, but the branch had previously issued a notice to disassociate itself from the office. The office has been presided over by Director-General Gao Guangjing, who, in the name of the Good Relief Branch Fishing Industry General Office, received six fishing boats from the director of the Supply Bureau of the Logistics Department. Gao rented them to others for smuggling and business. The investigation team believes that according to the charter of the Fishing Industry General Association, the takeover of enemy and puppet fishing boats was originally for the purpose of relieving fishermen and developing the fishing industry, but Gao openly embezzled them, so they sent the evidence to the Office of the Commander-in-Chief and requested that he be detained. Gao has directly admitted the embezzlement without denial.

[Another Dispatch] It is reported that the Japanese left behind 300 fishing boats in Guangdong, including 200 over 1,000 tons and the rest tens of tons each. The agencies that have taken over them include 19 from the Guangxi Provincial Government, more than 20 from the China Merchants Bureau, 36 from the Fishing Industry General Office, and 22 from the Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs, totaling only about 100 boats. The whereabouts of the remaining 200 are unknown. The investigation team is now preparing to investigate.

### Local Order Gradually Restored in Counties Recovered in Southwest Shandong; Emergency Relief Work Launched in Huaiyin Area

[Our Newspaper Jinan 30th Dispatch] The situation of the National Army in southwestern Shandong continues to expand, and the local order in the recovered county towns is gradually being restored. According to reports obtained by the government, the Communist Army's recent military conference decided to order Ta Yong, commander of the Third Column of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region, to lead 60,000 men to firmly defend the southern area of Fan County along the old course of the Yellow River, waiting for the National Army to reach the Yellow River Golden Dike in southern Juancheng, and then launch a general counterattack. It also ordered Gao Shuxun's troops to transfer to the area east of Jinan to harass the western section of the Jiaoji Railway. The movement of Communist troops in the suburbs of Caozhou and Jining is still busy and constantly in contact with the National Army.

(Our Newspaper Zhenjiang Dispatch) After the recovery of Huaiyin, it was ravaged and full of refugees, urgently awaiting relief. It is heard that the Jiangsu-Nanjing Branch especially, on the second day after the recovery of Huaiyin, in addition to assigning team members Wu Fan and Holmes to bring 200 tons of flour and 40,000 pieces of old clothing to Huaiyin and the counties under the jurisdiction of the Huaiyin Area in conjunction with the UNRRA area office to handle emergency relief, also telegraphed the head office to quickly allocate a large number of relief supplies to meet emergency needs. The Executive Yuan has ordered the Jiangsu-Nanjing Branch to take over the post-disaster relief work in various counties of the Huaiyin Area. The branch has decided to establish an office in Huaiyin to promote various businesses nearby, and has sent Zhang Tongmo to lead several relief workers and technical experts to prepare for the work and actively carry it out, and has allocated many vehicles for use in the area.

### Anqing Establishes Milk Stations to Benefit Students and the Poor

[Our Newspaper Anqing Dispatch] Since the Righteous People Evacuation Station, the Anqing Warehouse, the Righteous People Dormitory, the First Mobile Treatment Team, and the river embankment construction engineering team were successively ordered to be established in this port and actively promoted, they have benefited the disaster victims immensely in terms of relief supplies, diagnosis of the poor, and embankment construction. However, these relief supplies, such as milk, trotters, and oatmeal, are filled in the East Gate and the major Southern Goods stores in Sipailou, which is eye-catching. It only provides profit for merchants, which is detrimental to the original purpose of the agency. In order to prevent future leakage and sale of various materials and directly benefit the disaster victims, the Good Relief Branch specially sent Yuan Guohai, a cadre, leading a nutritional work team of three people, who arrived in this port from Tongcheng on the agency's special car on the afternoon of the 27th and stayed at the Lai'an Hotel on Lüba Street. It is learned that the agency plans to establish three milk stations in this city, entrusting the Relief Institute, Tongren Hospital, and Righteous People Evacuation Station and other three agencies to handle them separately, and establish a nutrition room, divided into four nutritional work teams, to carry out distribution and supervision work in different areas. The working area of the first team is the three counties of Tongcheng, Huaining, and Shucheng. Currently, the distributed materials are limited to milk. The distribution targets are students of primary and secondary schools and the general poor people awaiting feeding. The elderly are those over 60 years old, and the young children are those under 12 years old. Each person is given one pound of milk per day. If the relief supplies are supplied continuously in the future, they will be distributed to the counties for a long time.

### Yinfeng Road Bridge Collapses; Ningbo Fish Market Established

[Our Newspaper Ningbo Dispatch] The recent continuous autumn rain and mountain torrents in this port caused the Yuanzhen Bridge on Yinfeng Road to be damaged on the evening of the 25th. The bridge collapsed and the wooden piles were shaking. After learning about this, the Yinfeng Automobile Company reported to Yang Jian, the director of the Provincial Transportation Department, who came to Yong to inspect the highway. After verifying that it was true, Director Yang immediately sent two urgent telegrams, one to Minister Yu and one to Director Fang of the Highway Administration, reporting the destruction and requesting a quick allocation of 40 million yuan in repair funds. According to Director Yang, although the request has been telegraphed to the central government, it is difficult to determine when it will arrive. He (Director Yang) will return to the province on the 27th to report to Chairman Shen and request that the provincial funds be allocated first or borrowed from the governments of Yinfeng counties in advance so that construction can be started earlier.

### Hefei City Reconstruction Stipulates Street and Lane Widths

[Our Newspaper Hefei Dispatch] The provincial government has determined that Hefei is the temporary provincial capital and decided to complete the construction of Hefei, organizing the Municipal Engineering Office to preside over the work. However, because the city area was destroyed by the enemy and the houses were destroyed, merchants and residents are rebuilding their houses. In order to avoid widening the streets in the future and demolishing them again, the provincial government specially stipulated the standards for widening the streets and the setback methods for buildings on both sides, which have been announced to be followed. The content divides the width of the city's streets and lanes into five grades: the first grade is 12 meters, the second grade is 10.5 meters, the third grade is 8.5 meters, the fourth grade is 5.5 meters, and the fifth grade is 3.5 meters.

### Yiyao's Continuous Autumn Rain Damages Cotton Fields

[Our Newspaper Yuyao Dispatch] The cotton fields in the northern area of Yao cover 750,000 mu. During the war, due to insufficient self-sufficiency in grain, 5% of them were converted to sweet potatoes. After the victory, the price of cotton rose and it was restored to its original state. Unexpectedly, there was a severe drought this year, and the cotton bolls were not well formed. Since autumn, there has been continuous rain, and the accumulated water is a foot deep, resulting in root rot, which has shown signs of poor harvest. Cotton farmers are worried.

### Large-Scale Suppression of Lake Bandits; Deployment Decided by the Suppression Conference; Bandit Troops Near Mucheng Town Attempt to Stir Up Trouble

[Suzhou Dispatch] The Taihu Lake Area Suppression Conference has been convened for several days, and all relevant suppression issues have been decided. The conference closed on the afternoon of the 30th. Military and political personnel from the relevant counties have returned to their posts. It is heard that a large-scale suppression operation will be officially launched within days.

[Our Newspaper Suzhou 1st Dispatch] At about 3:00 p.m. on the 1st, the Taihu Lake Suppression Headquarters received intelligence that more than 100 troops of unknown numbers, equipped with long and short guns, were suddenly discovered in Shanrenqiao Town, 12 miles west of Mucheng Town, and they were buying daily necessities in Guangfu Town in groups. The headquarters sent cadres to conduct secret reconnaissance on the ground and confirmed that they had fled from the Xishan area at dawn that day. It was the Cai Sanle troops of the "New Fourth Army". It is said that they had threatened to loot Guangfu Town. However, the headquarters observed that Shanrenqiao Town is only 10 miles away from Xukou Town, and the Liao Bingnan surrender troops of Taihu Lake are being concentrated at the Xukou point for reorganization under orders. Cai's troops had previously sent personnel to contact Liao's troops to join the New Fourth Army without success. Now that the government is incorporating them, they may be unwilling and attempt to obstruct or attack Liao's troops, which is highly likely. Therefore, the Taihu Lake Suppression Department has taken emergency measures. In addition to ordering half of Liao's troops to stay on land and half along the lake shore to form a mutually supportive position, it has also transferred elite troops to strengthen the defense of Guangfu Town, and has also secretly deployed sentry soldiers on various roads to respond at any time. The department originally intended to encircle and suppress them, but it feared alarming the snake and wasting efforts. Currently, the residents of Guangfu are panicking and preparing for defense.

[Our Newspaper Suzhou 30th Dispatch] After the two commanders, Ma and Xu, of the Yangcheng Area Suppression Headquarters actively planned various implementation methods in the past few days, they have strictly ordered the Kunshan and Changshu command posts under their command to start promoting them immediately. It is learned that in order to implement unification of local party, government, and military affairs and to coordinate the suppression mission, the Changshu West Area Command Post, decided by Commander Guo Zhichi and Deputy Commander Pan Yichen, the county magistrate, will set off on the 1st to inspect the areas around Dongtang City, Bacheng, and the border area between Kunshan and Taicang on the edge of Yangcheng Lake, and to cooperate with military implementation, check household registration, and organize Baos and Jias. At the same time, propaganda teams will be dispatched to go deep into the people to promote the government's attention to the kindness of recruitment. It is heard that Guo and Pan plan to inspect for a week.

[Wuxi Dispatch] According to military sources: Jin Jiarang, a staff officer of the First Pacification District Headquarters, recruited Liao Bingnan's lake bandits, more than 100 of whom were concentrated on Sanshan. On the 29th, he and Commander Fu Jingfang went to Xukou to reorganize them. The necessary clothing and supplies had already been transported to Mucheng.

(Wuxi Dispatch) Recruitment Commissioner Yang Yanbin is ill in Mucheng. The bandits of Platform Mountain are concentrated on Sanshan awaiting orders. Other bandits continue to rob as usual. On the afternoon of the 22nd and the evening of the 23rd, Dongshan Township, Xishan, and Exiang Mountain were robbed one after another, and nine out of ten houses were empty. The bandits are furious because the wealthy households on Hengshan have no news of the ransom for the ticket of the son, even with the mother's ticket worth 20 million yuan. The residents of the entire mountain are panicking. If they are not suppressed quickly, the nearby residents will be in danger.

### Suzhou Arrests Flying Thief Who Possesses Superb Vaulting Skills

[Our Newspaper Suzhou Dispatch] Kaitai Clothing Store on Hulong Street in this county was stolen from in the late night of September 17, resulting in a loss of more than 10 million yuan. After reporting to the Criminal Police Team for investigation, the cadres determined after inspection and investigation that the thief must have entered over the high wall and must have special skills and was not done by one person. Cao Anchang, the captain of the Criminal Police Team, strictly supervised his subordinates and set a time limit to solve the case. After more than ten days of precise investigation, the First Squadron stationed outside the Lümen Gate obtained clues. On the morning of the 29th, the suspect, Little Monk, was arrested and interrogated first. According to his confession: the case was committed by Quan Cai, who was hiding at Student Alley No. 34. Liu Suye, who paddles the boat, has a superb skill: he can fly over high walls with a long bamboo pole. He has committed crimes many times, but because he can leave no traces, none of the cases have been solved. Several criminal police officers disguised themselves and went to the address. When they rushed into the room, the thief Liu realized that something was wrong. He hurriedly grabbed a bamboo pole and ran to the roof, hoping to fly over and escape. Fortunately, the criminal police bravely stepped forward and arrested him. In his home, the original goods of Kaitai Clothing Store, estimated to be worth 4 million yuan, were searched out. Both the person and the stolen goods were taken to the headquarters on the morning of the 30th for verification. During the interview, the reporter asked Captain Cao of the Criminal Police Team, who said that there are not many thieves with this so-called flying skill today. Now that he has been arrested, otherwise the Suzhou bourgeoisie will have no peaceful days.

### A Township Head in Suzhou Dies Tragically; Killed by Xue Yonghui's Troops of the "New Fourth Army"

[Our Newspaper Suzhou Dispatch] A shocking murder case occurred in Yaoshe Township, Xiangshan, the third district of the county, at 4:00 p.m. on September 27. The victim was Township Head Yao Fuxiang. His family came to the city to request an exemption from inspection, which was not approved. Liu, the prosecutor of the local court, led the coroner Wang Chunrong to the township in plain clothes on the morning of the 29th for an inspection. It was not until about 7:00 p.m. that he returned to the court to report. After inquiring about the inside details from various sources, the reporter learned that Yao Fuxiang originally opened a grain store in the area and served as the township head during the enemy and puppet era. Because the township is located on the edge of Taihu Lake, it is an area where Xue Yonghui's troops of the New Fourth Army operate. They had ordered him to collect land taxes on their behalf and were able to pay them monthly. After the Japanese surrendered, Yao continued to serve as township head and stopped collecting land taxes. Xue Yonghui repeatedly sent people to contact him, intending to continue collecting them. Yao prevaricated. Later, due to the urgency of the situation, he had no choice but to flee to Shanghai to settle down. Not long ago, he secretly returned to his hometown to run his old business, but Xue Yonghui found out and sent several subordinates, disguised as customers, entered Yao's store under the pretext of buying oil, shot him dead, and fled one after another. After the tragedy, the local military authorities paid great attention to it. They are now deploying countermeasures.

[Our Newspaper Hefei Dispatch] The refugees in Anhui Province who have no homes along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Line and are on the verge of death awaiting relief have repeatedly appealed through the Provincial Government, the Provincial Assembly, and the Nanjing Anhui Northeast Relief Association. The central government has allocated 300 million yuan for relief, and the Relief Administration has also allocated 2,000 tons of flour for relief.

### Appeal from Dockworkers in Pudong

The wages of dockworkers in Shanghai are meager due to layer upon layer of exploitation by contractors. The fact that contractors exploit the interests of workers is known to millions of citizens in Shanghai. In the past, dockworkers were controlled and manipulated by contractor bosses, and workers had no way to complain. Director Wu of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, since taking office, has spared no effort to alleviate the suffering of laborers. Our genuine dockworkers are organizing a genuine dockworkers' union, and the principle of preparing separately in each district has been approved. Vice Director Li even stated that he will investigate the wages of dockworkers to prevent contractors from exploiting them layer upon layer, which proves that the director and vice director are alleviating the suffering of dockworkers by addressing both the symptoms and the root cause. We dockworkers are grateful and tell our sons and brothers, as if seeing the blue sky through the clouds. Therefore, representatives of dockworkers from various docks in Pudong initiated the organization of the Pudong District Dockworkers' Union. However, large and small contractors must participate in the organization, and even the so-called Thirty-Six Gang has stepped forward to organize branches to confront the workers, compete for leadership, and oppress fellow workers. The union's work is being disrupted in every way, and a bloody tragedy is bound to occur. At present, tens of thousands of dockworkers in Pudong District are living in dire straits. In addition to submitting reports to the competent authorities, we also request assistance from people of all walks of life who uphold justice. (A tearful appeal from the representatives of all dockworkers in Pudong District)

### Why is the Garment Industry Raising Prices Again?

To the Editor: The local garment industry raised prices by 70% in June. Then, on the 11th of this month, it suddenly raised prices by another 60% for no reason. It is said that this has been approved by the Bureau of Social Affairs. The repeated price increases in the garment industry have a significant impact on the clothing of our citizens. Moreover, prices have not increased by 60% in the past three months. Therefore, this price increase is extremely unreasonable. It is hoped that the authorities will pay attention to it. It is also hoped that the garment industry trade union will clarify the reasons for the 60% price increase. (Tao Xun)

### Swapping Money on the Street

On August 26th, Mr. Zhang was holding 300,000 yuan in national currency and was shopping at a fruit stall on Tianzhutang Street. Three men resembling soldiers approached and asked Mr. Zhang to exchange banknotes. Zhang did not suspect anything and agreed. Unexpectedly, they suddenly snatched 100,000 yuan from Mr. Zhang's hand, which was then recovered. When he returned home and counted the large denominations, there were no mistakes. But after carefully counting the small denominations, he realized that most of them were small bills of five or ten yuan, resulting in a loss of 90,000 yuan in national currency. This matter is thought to have been done by unscrupulous individuals. While the impact of the loss on Mr. Zhang is small, the matter involves deception, and I dare to ask the authorities to strictly arrest these unscrupulous individuals to deter others from following suit. (Zhang Senyu)

### Bicycle Licenses Are Being Rushed into Production

A letter from the Municipal Bureau of Finance of this city states: "The letter from the Bureau of Public Utilities, Municipal Public (35) Secret No. 9958, states: 'The Shen Bao has forwarded a letter from Xu Zhonghan requesting a reply regarding the date of issuing small bicycle license plates. The manufacture, issuance, and collection of fees for these license plates are handled by your bureau. Please review and reply accordingly.' " With this approval, the small bicycle license plates for the first half of this year have already been manufactured and delivered to various district tax collection offices for distribution. Regarding the small license plates for the second half of the year, the processing procedures have taken a long time, resulting in failure to issue them as scheduled. They are currently being rushed into production by the manufacturer. As soon as they are manufactured and sent to the bureau, a public announcement will be made regarding the scheduled issuance. This letter is for your information and for forwarding. Sincerely, to the Shen Bao.

### Urgent Need for a Bank in Sijing Town

To whom it may concern: Sijing Town in western Shanghai is the leading town in Songjiang County and is also the hub of the Shanghai-Songjiang-Qingpu waterway. Moreover, it is rich in agricultural products from the surrounding countryside, so the rice industry is developed and there are many rice mills. All industries are also thriving because of this. Since the victory, all industries have resumed business one after another. However, financial services are still lacking, making it extremely difficult to adjust the funds of various businesses. Often, Business A has a large sum of money but nowhere to temporarily deposit it, while Business B needs a large sum of money but lacks access to borrowing. This causes the money supply to tighten, which has an infinite impact on the market. In minor matters, if merchants want to remit money to other ports, they must go to Shanghai, wasting travel expenses and time. These two inconveniences alone show that the town urgently needs the establishment of a financial institution. Moreover, it is guaranteed that business will develop. I am making this request to the Shanghai Banking Association on behalf of the merchants and people of the entire town, hoping that you will encourage your member banks to send personnel to Sijing to investigate. If it can be confirmed that this is a factual need, and a branch office can be established in our town, all sectors will feel the convenience. (Qin Mingqi and Qian Shenyu, merchants and residents of Sijing Town)

### Final Fate of German War Criminals Decided: Nuremberg Tribunal Ends; Von Papen Held Reception for Reporters Yesterday

[Our Dispatch] Paris, 1st (Radio): Nuremberg dispatch - Today is the second day of the court's sentencing, and the final fate of the Nazi war criminals has been decided. At 3:40 PM, Presiding Judge Lawrence announced the adjournment and expressed his gratitude to the jury. With this, the eight Allied judges have completed their duties, and the mission of the International Military Tribunal has come to an end.

[Agence France-Presse, Nuremberg, 1st] The indictment of the International Military Tribunal against German war criminals listed four major charges. Those who committed all four crimes would inevitably face the death penalty. Those who did not commit all four crimes or did not fall under the four crimes had room for leniency. The four major charges are: (1) common conspiracy against peace; (2) crimes against peace, namely launching aggressive wars in violation of national treaties, agreements, and promises; (3) crimes of war, namely violating the Hague International Conventions; (4) crimes against humanity.

Another telegram stated that the International Military Tribunal announced this morning that the charges against the 22 German war criminals (one of whom was tried in absentia) are as follows: A. Six who committed all four crimes: former Air Force Marshal Göring, former Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, former Army Chief of Staff Keitel, former Reich Protector of Bohemia and Moravia Neurath, Nazi soldier Rosenberg, and Jodl. B. Four who committed three crimes: former Navy Commander-in-Chief Dönitz and Raeder, former Economics Minister Funk, and former Reich Protector of Bohemia and Moravia Frick. C. Eight who committed two crimes: former Nazi Party Representative Hess, former Labor Front leader Sauckel, former Head of the Austrian Secret Police Kaltenbrunner, former Governor-General of the General Government of Poland Frank, Nazi propagandist Streicher, former Governor of Austria and the occupied Netherlands Seyss-Inquart, former Minister of Armaments Speer, and Hitler's deceased representative Bormann. D. One who committed one crime: former Hitler Youth leader Schirach. E. Three who were acquitted: former Ambassador to Turkey von Papen, former Stormtrooper leader Fritzsche, and former Nazi Party financier Schacht.

[Our Dispatch] Paris, 1st (Emergency Radio): Nuremberg dispatch - Von Papen, Schacht, and Fritzsche, who were acquitted by the Nuremberg Tribunal, will hold a press conference at 3:00 PM today.

[Our Dispatch] Paris, 1st (Radio): Nuremberg dispatch - Von Papen, Schacht, and Fritzsche held a reception for reporters this afternoon. Von Papen declared that his political life had been quite tortuous and that he was not as fortunate as his friend Schacht, and that he currently had no fixed plans. Whether he will immediately go to the French-occupied area to be with his wife, or to Hamburg in the British-occupied area where his daughter is located, he could not yet predict. When a reporter asked whether he would still be released as the Third Reich's number one veteran diplomat, he smiled and said: "Gentlemen, there is no doubt." Von Papen concluded by saying that because he had been isolated from the free outside world for too long, he was unable to announce his future plans to everyone today.

### Different Expressions at the Moment of Sentencing: Göring Retreated Quickly with an Arrogant Demeanor; Hess Looked Up at the Sky as if Moved; Fritzsche Cried and Laughed Upon Being Acquitted

[Our Dispatch] Paris, 1st (Radio): Nuremberg dispatch - Final reports from the courtroom: Streicher showed no reaction when the sentence was read, and his face was expressionless. Funk's eyes were wide open, and his face was stunned. He was helped down the stairs by military police and walked towards the prison gate. Dönitz and Keitel stood upright and listened to the sentence without showing any emotion. Raeder seemed shocked but quickly withdrew. Most of the defendants were indifferent when the sentence was read, as if they did not understand what was being said. While Presiding Judge Lawrence was reading the crimes committed by each defendant, the defendants stood still and waited, as if still expecting something, until the military police signaled them to leave the courtroom one by one. Sauckel looked even more fierce, and the death penalty seemed unexpected to him. After hearing the sentence, Göring quickly retreated, so there was not enough time to observe his reaction. He immediately took off his hat and handed it to the military police, his expression like that of a high-ranking minister. Hess refused to accept the hat handed to him by the military police and stared at the ceiling, as if he had not understood the sentence because it was read in English. After hearing the sentence, General Jodl hung his head dejectedly, as if resigned to fate. Speer looked satisfied when he learned that he was only sentenced to 20 years in prison. Neurath maintained the demeanor of a veteran diplomat with a solemn expression.

[Agence France-Presse, Nuremberg, 1st] In the last court session today, the International Tribunal separately determined the sentences of the defendants. Although those who were convicted tried to appear calm, their unease was revealed on their faces. Among them, Fritzsche's crying and laughing was particularly comical. He was once a radio propagandist and was good at acting. When he first heard the judge announce that he was innocent, he was deeply moved. But when he heard that his friend Bormann was convicted, tears welled up in his eyes. Then he realized that Bormann was only being tried in absentia and there was no major problem, so he laughed through his tears again. When the court adjourned, the convicted people surrounded Schacht, von Papen, and Fritzsche to celebrate their acquittal. Speer shook hands with Schacht for a long time, as this would be the last time the two would shake hands.

### Key Points of the Judgment: Aggression is the Greatest Crime

[United Press, Nuremberg, 30th] The International Military Tribunal today read part of the judgment, the key points of which are as follows:

Crimes in violation of international law are committed by people (not abstract entities). Only by punishing individual criminals can the provisions of international law be implemented. Individuals have international responsibilities, which transcend the obligation to obey the state. Germany accepted dictatorship and all its terror and contemptuous methods, and openly denied the rule of law. Hitler, in his book "Mein Kampf," fully explained his ambitions to prepare for aggression. Germany's launch of war against Poland was a blatant war of aggression. The attacks on Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg were without reason. Germany also meticulously planned to destroy the Soviet Union and prevent it from becoming a political and military power. The claim that the Soviet Union intended to attack Germany is unbelievable. The possibility of directly attacking the United States was considered as a future event. Ribbentrop himself urged Yosuke Matsuoka to have Japan fight against Britain and the United States. In addition, the statute of the court stipulated that planning or engaging in a war of aggression or a war in violation of international treaties is a criminal act. The court ruled that some defendants were guilty of planning and engaging in wars of aggression against twelve countries, and therefore committed the above-mentioned crimes. As officials of the German government, all or at least some of the defendants should have known that Germany had signed various treaties prohibiting the use of war to resolve international disputes. Most of the defendants claimed that they were acting on Hitler's orders and could not be held responsible for the crimes committed in carrying out the orders. However, Article 8 of the court's statute stipulates that a defendant's actions on the orders of the government or superiors should not relieve him of his responsibility, but may be considered in reducing punishment. Considering the differences in the criminal law of most countries, the real key lies not in the issue of orders, but in the issue of moral choice.

### The Nuremberg Tribunal's Solemn Verdict: Creating a Precedent for the Trial of Japanese War Criminals; Collusion in Aggression and Crimes Against Humanity Are Unavoidable

[United Press, Tokyo, 1st] The Nuremberg Tribunal's solemn verdict on German war criminals will have a significant impact on the Tokyo International Tribunal's trial of the 27 Japanese defendants. The precedent set by the Nuremberg Tribunal in legal principles strikes at the Japanese defendants' argument that the militarists were deceived by patriotism and attempted to save the country from an intractable situation and are therefore innocent. Most of the Japanese defendants have apparently given up hope of being acquitted, but will ultimately argue that the United States and the Allies drove Japan to war. Official opinions cannot be ascertained for the time being, but according to observers, since the Nuremberg Tribunal has specifically determined the existence of various crimes, the war of aggression, and the German-Japanese conspiracy, any attempt to defend oneself on the grounds of national self-defense will remain very bleak. Yosuke Matsuoka, the former Japanese Foreign Minister and one of the main protagonists of the German-Japanese conspiracy, has already died of illness and cannot be held accountable. Other important defendants include former Ambassador to Germany Oshima, who was mentioned in documents in both courts. The Nuremberg Tribunal's verdict confirms the brutality and crimes of senior officials in violation of humanity. The prosecution here particularly values this. The Japanese war criminals include those who have committed numerous evils, from Tojo to Matsui, the protagonist of the Nanjing Massacre. The Nuremberg Tribunal's conviction of several Nazi Party organizations does not directly affect Japan at present. It is heard that the prosecution here has discussed trying all personnel of Japanese agencies such as the Kempeitai, but what has been decided so far is still to indict individual personnel, not the entire organization. Personnel of the Japanese Kempeitai are currently being indicted by Mr. Karpentor, Director of the Legal Section of General MacArthur's Headquarters.

### Eisenhower on International Cooperation

[Reuters, Berlin, 30th] US Army Chief of Staff General Eisenhower told reporters here today: "Every intelligent person knows that the world can no longer endure another world war, and human civilization can no longer suffer the scourge of war. I personally think that we have made some progress in avoiding war. Some people in the United States have a neurotic pessimism, which is not the case. We must never be discouraged. International cooperation is not impossible. We should continue to cooperate to produce good results, such as the Allied Control Council in Berlin, which is an agency that carries out its tasks in good faith. Anglo-American economic cooperation in Germany is also a good example."

### The United States is Watching Turkish-Soviet Relations

[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 1st (Radio): Government officials said that regarding the recent note sent by the Soviet Union to Turkey regarding the Dardanelles Strait, the Turkish government has consulted the British and American governments for their opinions and decided on a response. It is said that the US response will be issued within a week. Prior consultation with the army and navy authorities is required. People do not need to panic excessively, but the tense situation is a fact. The Soviet note requested participation in the management of the straits.

### President Truman Elaborates on Pacific Base Policy; U.S. Navy Secretary Discusses Mediterranean Fleet Mission

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 30th] President Truman held a special press conference today to explain the United States' policy regarding existing bases in the Pacific, with Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Towers also in attendance. According to the plan announced by the President, Guam and Saipan will remain the heart of the U.S. defense network in the Western Pacific. Secondary bases will be established on the islands of Okinawa, Truk, Espiritu Santo, and Kwajalein. A decision has not yet been made regarding which base the United States will utilize in the Philippines. In New Guinea, the U.S. plans to abandon part of the Manus Island base in Australia. In the North Pacific, a consolidated base is being established near Kodiak Island in Alaska for use by the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 30th] Secretary of the Navy Forrestal recently gave a speech here explaining the mission of the U.S. Navy in the Mediterranean. He stated: Since the early 19th century, the United States has regularly maintained a fleet in European waters, especially the Mediterranean. In the years following the end of World War I, when the situation was still unstable, the U.S. Mediterranean Fleet made significant contributions to establishing peace in the Balkans and the Middle East. Today, the U.S. Navy continues to be stationed in the Eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean, for two purposes: (1) to supply the Allied occupation forces in the occupied territories of Europe and to assist the Allied military governments in fulfilling their missions; and (2) to protect American interests and support American policies. At the same time, the presence of the U.S. Navy in these regions has the following benefits: (1) U.S. naval officers and sailors can gain excellent training opportunities and become familiar with the waters they patrol and the traditions and customs of the countries they visit. (2) Boosting naval morale, as many officers and sailors still "broaden their horizons" as a reason for joining the Navy. (3) U.S. Navy personnel can have the opportunity to practice goodwill and understanding with the people they encounter.

[United Press, Washington, 30th] President Truman today received a detailed report on U.S. naval military operations in the Pacific and immediately met with Secretary of the Navy Forrestal and Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Theater Nimitz. Towers told reporters that the Navy has reduced the number of bases it originally planned to retain after the war due to budget cuts.

### Japan's Three Major Zaibatsu Companies Officially Announce Dissolution Yesterday

The three companies have already paid up capital of 1.097 billion yen, and all securities are scheduled to be transferred to the Adjustment Committee in the near future.

### Fierce Fighting Underway Along the Persian Gulf Coast

[United Press, Tehran, 30th] Iranian government forces are engaged in fierce fighting with Southern tribal rebels along a 100-mile stretch of the Persian Gulf coast. The rebels have occupied half of the port of Bushehr, and the defending forces are engaged in street fighting with them. The tribal forces are advancing northwest from Bushehr to Bandar-e Mahshahr, 140 miles away.

### British Troops Withdraw Completely from Lebanon

### Uproar in the Far East Tribunal: French Prosecutor Insists on Speaking in French, Court President Angered by Violation of Rules

[United Press, Tokyo, 1st] After a full day of debate, the Far East International Tribunal today decided to allow French Prosecutor Oneto to speak in his native language, but Oneto threatened to resign unless he apologized to the court. Oneto claimed that he represented the great nation of France, and if he was not allowed to speak in French, he would have to withdraw from the case. Webb, hearing this, became furious and said that he hoped to hear Oneto's apology when the court reconvened in the afternoon. The prosecutors then requested an adjournment until the next morning so that Oneto could have ample time to consider whether to apologize to the court or withdraw. Webb had told Oneto that the court's regulations stipulated that only English or Japanese could be used. Defense attorney Levin said that the court rules specifically stated that only English and Japanese could be used, and the court had no power to amend the rules, but the court finally allowed the use of French, meaning that Soviet prosecutors could also use Russian in the future.

[United Press, Tokyo, 1st] When the Far East International Tribunal convened today, Prosecutor Keenan requested the court to also use French, arguing for two hours, and the court adjourned at noon without a decision. Presiding Judge Webb said that the core issue was whether the court had the power to adopt a third or fourth language, as the court rules limited testimony to English and Japanese.

### France in Revival (Part 1)

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Song Yu

[Correspondence from Paris, September 15th] A friend who has lived in Paris for a while took me to a restaurant. Over a 100-centimeter baguette, we inadvertently argued with a waiter. According to French regulations, each person's ration per meal is a 100-centimeter baguette, but this friend was naturally blessed with an appetite that exceeded that of others, and 200 centimeters were not enough to satisfy him. Because the waiter refused to give him more, this friend became angry and said, "How many French people gorge themselves in China, and we haven't argued, why are you stingy with these few Chinese?" Unexpectedly, these words won the sympathy of many French people sitting nearby, who all chimed in and asked about the current situation in China. Someone asked, "Is there no problem with food in China now?" This friend said more confidently, "No problem, as long as you have money." The French seemed not to quite believe it and turned to solicit my opinion, asking,

"Is it really okay as long as you have money?" I also smiled wryly and said, "With money, anything is possible." Generally speaking, although the situation in France today is not like that in China, where people are starving to death on the one hand, while restaurants and singing halls are still full of delicacies, it is also not as strictly restricted as in England, where the menu always has the same few items and the prices are always the same, where the rich have no place to spend their money and the poor don't have to worry about starving to death. France seems to be somewhere in between, where the poor are slightly worse off, and the rich have their own ample space to wield the power of their wealth, but not without limits. Those of us who have come here from England are already complacent and don't want to return, so naturally we don't dare to be too demanding. We carefully observe from an objective standpoint and cannot help but admire the speed of their recovery. Both England and France are almost back to their pre-war state. The difference is that

English goods emphasize foreign trade, and the best products are sold abroad to compete for the market, and only cheap and necessary items are allowed to be sold domestically. Therefore, there are no luxury goods to be seen in the English market to this day, but if you read the monthly report of the Board of Trade, you will know that England's export trade has long exceeded the previous numbers, and is now continuing to increase, which shows the speed of the recovery of British industry. On the contrary, although French industry and commerce are also recovering rapidly and exports are also increasing monthly, it is still difficult to compare with England and the United States due to various factors. Moreover, France's policy is not as combative as that of England. The products of factories, whether luxury goods or practical goods, can be sold equally at home and abroad. The glass windows are full of novel products, dazzling the eye, especially for the average visitor from London, who seems to have entered a fairyland. In fact, people around the world who like to buy beautiful clothes are gradually turning their eyes to Paris again. During my stay in Paris, Paris opened a

fashion exhibition, to advertise for major shops, which caused a sensation in Europe. The European edition of the New York Herald Tribune used a large headline, saying that French fashion was once again leading the world, and that fashion lovers around the world would once again take the new styles of Paris as the standard of popularity. Therefore, the fairyland of human enjoyment in the future may again be counted as Paris. Once, a reporter met a young American girl who had just arrived in Paris and asked him what he thought of Paris. He said, "It's great, whatever you want, there is." I asked him how it was compared to the United States, she thought for a moment and said, "Except that there is not enough milk, I don't feel any inconvenience." This is the situation in Paris today. However, it must be added here that today

Paris has a lot of supplies, and although luxury goods are abundant, nineteen are French products, and there are very few imported goods. For example, Swiss watches are famous all over the world, and Americans who go to mainland Europe, no one does not buy a few Swiss watches back, but France, which is close to the water, does not easily get Swiss watches, and there are many clocks and watches on the market, all of which are French products, and very few are imported from Switzerland. From this, it can also prove the speed of the French industrial revival

### City Council and Fourteen Other Groups Jointly Host U.S. Military Dependents; Grand Garden Party Held at Lido Garden Yesterday; Speaker Pan Delivered a Speech on Behalf of All Sectors to Welcome Them

The Shanghai City Council, the Shanghai Local Association, the Shanghai Press Association, the City Education Association, the City Lawyers Association, the City Chamber of Commerce, the City Bankers Association, the City Industrial Association, the City Federation of Trade Unions, the City Money Trade Association, the City Daily Press Association, the City Accountants Association, the City Farmers Association, and the Sixth District Cotton Textile Industry Association of Shanghai, etc. held a garden party yesterday afternoon at the Lido Garden to host the U.S. military dependents who recently came to Shanghai. The party began at 4 o'clock. Mayor Wu and his wife arrived early to fulfill the hospitality of the host. Guests then arrived in pairs, totaling more than 200 people, mingling and chatting, and the atmosphere was extremely warm and harmonious, truly a grand event.

Then, Speaker Pan Gongzhan delivered a welcoming speech on behalf of all sectors, which stated: Today, the Shanghai City Council, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, the Shanghai Education Association, the Shanghai Daily Press Association, the Shanghai Local Association, the Shanghai Farmers Association, the Shanghai Industrial Association, the Shanghai Bankers Association, the Shanghai Money Trade Association, the Shanghai Lawyers Association, the Shanghai Accountants Association, the Shanghai Press Association, and the Sixth District Cotton Textile Industry Association, and other fourteen groups, are meeting at the Lido Garden, representing the four million citizens of Shanghai, to welcome the families of the American soldiers stationed in China, I am very honored to have the opportunity to briefly speak on behalf of these groups. The United States and China are allied nations on both sides of the Pacific Ocean. They fought shoulder-to-shoulder during the war and are working together to maintain peace after the war. We are very grateful for American aid to China during the war, and we are especially grateful for the American military's stay in China after the war to help us repatriate Japanese prisoners and residents and to promote peace and unity in China. Because we firmly believe that the mission of the American military's temporary stay in China is to assist China's post-war recovery, so that China, which has fought hard for eight years, can embark on the path of unity, peace, and strength as soon as possible, so as to fulfill its obligations as a member of the United Nations to maintain world peace together, and that the United States has no selfish intentions whatsoever. After defeating Japan, American soldiers could have returned to their country and enjoyed their family life as soon as possible, but they stayed in China to assist at China's request, which caused a delay in their repatriation. It is a pity, and now that your families have come to China one after another, you can share your longing after a long separation with you, and this is not only to congratulate you on your family reunion in China, but also to give the Eastern civilization represented by Chinese cultural relics and customs the opportunity to connect with the distinguished guests who have come to China for the first time, so that American allies can increase their understanding of China, which will undoubtedly benefit the cooperation between the two major allies in the future. Shanghai is an international city with a hundred years of history. It is the gateway to China, and we Chinese have always valued hospitality to distinguished guests. Therefore, whether you stay in Shanghai for a long time or a short time, we all hope that we can contribute to your stay so that you can have the pleasure of "feeling at home." Today's garden party is just one aspect of this. What I want to tell you more clearly is that the United States is truly a good friend of China, and whether it is Britain, the Soviet Union, France, or other united countries, all are good friends of China. "All under heaven are one family" and "the world is one community" have always been the ideals of Chinese sages, and also the purpose of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the father of the nation, in advocating revolution. Now, taking advantage of the opportunity to welcome good friends, we will share our sincerity of "being kind to our neighbors" and "emphasizing trustworthiness" with the people of the world. Today, the hospitality is inadequate and the wording is simple, please forgive us and give us more advice. After the speech, enthusiastic applause was given all around. Then, Ms. Wang Xiaogu gave a brief speech: In the past, she had participated in many grand receptions for the Allied forces in the inland, but there were only Allied soldiers without their families. Today, she is very happy to be able to gather with the American soldiers and their families. Then, the grand entertainment program began, and the Chinese martial arts performance was the most popular with the guests, which greatly gained the guests' interest. The party ended in joy at about 6 o'clock.

### Zhong He's Integrity is Commendable for Refusing Gifts from Vendors

Zhong He, the section chief of the first section of the Xujiahui Branch of the Police Bureau, was ordered to enforce the crackdown on street vendors diligently. On the 18th of last month, vendor representatives He Zhu'ao and Zhu Yunzhang came to petition, requesting the General Bureau to approve an extension of half a month to show consideration. On the morning of the 22nd, at 10:00 AM, He and Zhu suddenly visited Section Chief Zhong at his residence and presented him with a sealed envelope containing a 400,000 yuan check from the Guohua Bank. Section Chief Zhong immediately stated solemnly that public officials should be honest and abide by the law and must not accept any gifts from the people, and asked them to take it back immediately, but the two representatives He and Zhu insisted that this was out of their own volition and did not want to take the group. Section Chief Zhong then reported the information to Chief Bai of the branch, who reported to the General Bureau that the section chief was diligent, cautious, and honest, and should be commended. It is heard that the General Bureau believes that the section chief's integrity is a model for police officers and, in addition to ordering that the 400,000 yuan check be handed over to the Xujiahui Branch for immediate return, will also give him an award.

### Handover Ceremony of New and Old Chairmen of the City Party Headquarters Held Yesterday; Chen Shiquan Represents the Central Government in Supervision; Fang Zhi Stays in Beijing Due to Illness, Chen Baojie Represents Him in Receiving

Chen Shiquan represented the Central Government in supervising the handover. Former Chairman Wu Shao-shu formally handed over all the registration books and files. The new Chairman, Fang Zhi, was unable to arrive due to illness and staying in Beijing.

### Judge in Embezzlement Case at the Railway Bureau's Materials Department Ill; No Further Hearing Yesterday

[Report from This Newspaper] The embezzlement case at the Railway Bureau's Materials Department was originally scheduled to continue hearing in the First Criminal Court of the District Court yesterday morning, but because the judge in charge of the case, Mei Erhe, was ill and requested leave, the case was adjourned for trial. The thirty-six defendants in the case and the thirty lawyers hired by them all appeared in court yesterday to prepare their defenses. Twenty reporters from various newspapers and many Railway Bureau employees and relatives and friends of the defendants also attended the hearing.

### A Wide Array of Samples: A Grand Sight - Export Goods Exhibition Officially Opened Yesterday - Venue Set at the YMCA, Grand in Scale, Profound Significance Under Shrinking Exports

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] The China Export Goods Exhibition, meticulously prepared for three months, finally had its official opening yesterday at 2:00 PM at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA! As the reporter stepped out of the stuffy train car, the first thing that caught the eye was a large red and white cloth banner surrounding the giant gate of the YMCA, adorned with the large characters "China Export Goods Exhibition," giving one a sense that this would be no ordinary exhibition. Indeed, in the current state of import dumping and shrinking exports, this exhibition holds special significance.

Complete Collection of Tung Oil Specimens

When the reporter arrived at the YMCA, the first venue on the ground floor was not yet fully arranged, so I had to start from the sixth venue on the third floor, looking at them in reverse order. The entire sixth venue was set up and exhibited by the China Vegetable Oil Factory alone. Here, various kinds of vegetable oil seeds were collected, among which the most noteworthy was tung oil, a specialty of our country. Almost all kinds of specimens, from tung seeds, tung leaves, to tung trunks, were collected. There was even a *xieju* tree planted here. From the charts on the wall, one could see the important position of China's tung oil in international trade. A diagram of the tung oil pressing process with a blue background and white drawings allowed visitors to understand the entire pressing process at a glance! The fifth venue displayed enamelware and porcelain. It is said that enamelware sold well in various parts of Southeast Asia before the war, but now it still needs to be developed. The porcelain section mostly featured small and exquisite figurines of people and horses, and a few porcelain pots were particularly exquisite!

Furs and Carpets Attract Attention

The second, third, and fourth venues were all on the second floor. They were much larger in scale than the fifth and sixth venues! In the fourth venue, the bone buttons, furs, and carpets on display were all eye-catching items. The fur section collected various animal skins. A golden leopard skin coat was hung in the center, priced at a staggering two and a half million yuan. Whether this price is suitable for export is questionable. The carpet section displayed knitted wool carpets produced by Hengfengyong Factory. It is said that the United States is the largest importer of carpets. After the recent exchange rate adjustment, carpet exports have become more active. For example, the factory has recently sold an average of 10,000 square feet per month. The third venue displayed various knitted goods such as fancy socks and handkerchiefs. There were also various drawn thread works known for their exquisite craftsmanship, and dazzling five-colored duck down quilts. The Meiya Silk Weaving Factory also displayed various silk products here.

Seeking Compensation for Wartime Silk Losses from Japan

The second venue featured exhibits of all kinds of silk fabrics from the China Silk Company, D誠 Silk Factory, and the Electrical Silk Weaving Association. It is said that the China Silk Company spent a total of ten million yuan on installing tree windows and displays. Among them, a large pattern made of white silk braids nailed onto a red and blue silk background was particularly alarming. According to the data revealed above, the relationship between China's silk industry and export trade, from 1927 to 1936, the average annual export value was 1,067,609,000 yuan, and the average annual export value was 156,858,000 yuan. The silk export value accounted for 14.69% of the total export value. From January to July of this year, the total export value was 96,364,791,000 yuan, and the silk export value was 16,659,271,690 yuan. The silk export value accounted for 17% of the total export value. On the other hand, it also revealed that the total loss of China's wartime silk industry was 2,003,000 metric tons of silk production, and the total loss of silk machinery was 300 million yuan (pre-war currency value). The total number of mulberry trees lost was 2 million. All of these are to be compensated for by Japan!

High Expectations for Foreign Merchants' Visits

The first venue was on the lowest floor, the largest in scale, and had the most units. Sewing needles and sewing machine needles from the Da Zhong Industrial Factory, records; Shaoxing wine from the Kailin Canned Food Factory; glassware from the Xinhua Glass Factory; hot water bottles from the China Xingye, Yi Chang, and Dan Ye Factories; and medicines from Xinya, Xinyi, Wuzhou, Sino-French, and Foci, all had their own characteristics. In addition, China's specialty pig bristles and peppermint were also on display here with complete samples.

It is said that on the first day of the exhibition yesterday, quite a few foreign merchants visited. This shows what kind of expectations foreign merchants have for China's export products. It is hoped that all export manufacturers can find ways to improve quality and strive to reduce costs, which are prerequisites for promoting exports! At the same time, the general public may wish to take the opportunity of the exhibition to broaden their knowledge. The exhibition time is from yesterday to the 6th, from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM every day. Admission is completely free.

### Puppet Municipal Government Stealing and Selling Real Estate - More Than Eight-tenths of a Plot Found

[Report from Our Newspaper] Many public properties of the former French Concession were concealed and stolen by the French Municipal Council, and some were also sold by the puppet municipal government. According to sources, there is a small plot of vacant land near the Huangpu Branch, measuring 0.824 *li*. On July 12, 1932, it was sold to Wu Delin by the puppet municipal government. According to authorities in the French Concession, this transaction is invalid.

The former Joint Public Property Handling Committee of the Two Concessions, by order of the Executive Yuan, should invite relevant countries to send advisors to discuss the matter together. Where there is profit, there will be much debate, so this issue is becoming more and more complicated and may not be resolved in the short term.

### Central Trust Bureau Holds Bureau Affairs Meeting

Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the Central Trust Bureau held its first bureau affairs meeting after the victory. Chairman Bei Zuyi delivered a speech, stating that the business of the Central Trust Bureau is to promote the government's current national policies and serve society, and it cannot be compared with ordinary trust institutions. Director Liu Gongyun reported that the bureau opened on October 1, 1935, and it has been exactly eleven years since then. Recalling eleven years ago, only two years after the establishment of the Shanghai Head Office, the Sino-Japanese War broke out. In the past eight years, it has been developing its business in the interior. Currently, there are 17 branches and 15 offices, which shows the wide range of its business. The focus of this meeting is to seek to improve bureau affairs, promote business, and make the agencies of various branches closely linked. It is also learned that the bureau has successively received more than 160 proposals from various branches on improving business. It has been decided to first form a small group meeting to review the proposals, provide opinions, and then submit them to the general meeting for public decision. The above small group meetings are divided into seven groups, including insurance, real estate, trust, and savings. Yesterday afternoon from 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM, the insurance small group meeting was held first.

### Resolution of Labor-Management Disputes in the Commercial Press

The labor-management dispute in the Commercial Press was resolved yesterday afternoon after the Mediation Section of the Social Affairs Bureau convened labor and management for the fifth time. As a result, labor and management cooperated in a spirit of mutual understanding until 6:00 PM, and a mediation was finally reached.

### New Director of the US Information Service, Cordier, Arrives in Shanghai to Take Over

The new acting director of the US Information Service in China, Cordier, recently arrived in Shanghai from the United States to take office, replacing the former director, Fairbank. At the same time, he will also act as executive director. The executive director, Connors, who was originally responsible for Shanghai, has been transferred to Nanjing to work. Mr. Cordier was born in Fujian Province, China, and speaks fluent Min dialect. He is very familiar with the situation in China. He is very willing to have more contact with Chinese culture and press people during his visit to Shanghai.

### Two People Meet on a Narrow Road and Accuse Each Other of Being Traitors

Yang Yingsheng, from Anhui Province, lives at No. 190, North Xizang Road. When he was walking on Xizang Road yesterday morning, he met Li Dasan (38 years old, from Anhui Province). During the period of the enemy puppet regime, Li Dasan served as the head of the Construction Section of the Dangtu County Government in Anhui Province. Yang Yingsheng was also working underground in Dangtu County at the time. He was arrested by the enemy police in Wuhu, so he knew Li Dasan. Yang immediately stepped forward, grabbed Li, and took him directly to the Taishan Police Station under its jurisdiction to report the information. Li Dasan admitted that he had served as the puppet section chief, but said that Yang Yingsheng was also working as a special agent for the Dangtu puppet county government at the time. The police station then submitted a document to the High Procuratorate for trial.

### A Casual Discussion of Press Conferences: Some Are Fierce, Some Are Cunning, Some Are Smooth, Some Are Tricky, Some Are Harsh, Some Are Humorous, Sometimes They Can Be Like a Good Show, Sometimes Like Being Hypnotized

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] "Yesterday at × o'clock, ××× hosted a press conference for reporters from various newspapers in the city..."

News that begins like this has appeared on the newspapers almost every day recently. Readers of newspapers are probably all familiar with the term "press conference."

However, from the perspective of the reporters who are "invited," the "flavor" of these many press conferences is different: attending a good press conference is simply like watching a good show (of course, sometimes it's not just "watching," but also "acting" oneself), with verbal swords and guns, which is very enjoyable; but if you encounter a bad press conference, it is really extremely painful and unbearable.

The first thing about a "good" press conference is that it starts on time, and the second is that the host really has something to say and can say it clearly. Most press conferences of political parties meet the above two conditions. A good spokesperson can make you admire his "clear and logical" skills even if you disagree with his views; no matter how fierce you ask, he always answers smoothly; if you ask fiercely, he answers cleverly; if you ask harshly, he answers humorously.

Zhang Junmai's Witty Reply

I think that the press conference when the Democratic Socialist Party was established was very successful. First, Mr. Zhang Junmai is a scholar, sincere and dignified, and his words are truthful, which naturally makes people convinced. Second, his assistants were very good, circling around and accurately grasping the reactions of the reporters. It just so happened that a reporter who liked to speak was a little lacking in tact and asked a naive question, so one of the spokespersons replied wittily, and the result was that all the reporters laughed and stood up to leave. Do you want to know how he asked?

"Excuse me, Mr. Zhang Junmai: it seems that in the minds of most Chinese people now, there are only two parties, one is the Kuomintang and the other is the Communist Party. May I ask, in terms of ideology, does the Democratic Socialist Party lean towards the Kuomintang or the Communist Party?"

At that time, a reporter sitting opposite me wrote four large characters for me to see: "Looking for trouble!"

Sure enough, Mr. Zhang Junmai replied with both anger and amusement: "How many people are there in the Kuomintang? Let's say 100 million. How many people are there in the Communist Party? Let's say 50 million. Then among the 450 million Chinese people, there are still many left, and the scope of activities of other parties is very large - very large!"

As a result, everyone burst into laughter.

Wedemeyer's Clever Evasion

Many dignitaries often have witty remarks when evading reporters' questions at press conferences. Not long after Marshall came to China, he summoned Wedemeyer, who had not yet left China at that time, and had a secret talk for a long time. At Wedemeyer's press conference, a reporter went straight to the point and asked, "General Wedemeyer, can you tell us what Marshall and you talked about?"

This question was what all the reporters wanted to ask, but everyone also knew that Wedemeyer probably didn't want to answer this question very much. As a result, the atmosphere immediately became tense, and everyone watched how he would answer.

Who knew that Wedemeyer touched his silver hair and said, "Forgot."

The method used by the new director of the UNRRA office in China, Eggerton, to avoid reporters' questions was also very interesting. He first gave a rambling speech about his impressions and hopes on taking office. As soon as he finished speaking, he asked, "Any questions?"

A Ten-Minute Press Conference

In fact, at that time, the reporters had countless questions in their minds about the UNRRA suspension order. Unexpectedly, General Eggerton waited for at most two seconds. The reporters had not yet figured out how to phrase their questions, but he had already said, "Thank you all for attending, we'll talk later." This press conference ended before the reporters could even ask questions. I remember that this meeting lasted for a total of probably less than ten minutes.

The longest press conferences were those of the former United Association of Factories Moving to Sichuan and Guangxi, which often lasted for seven or eight speeches, three or four hours. Indeed, the experiences of the industrialists who moved inland were worthy of everyone's sympathy, but if they could often publish their opinions in writing, at least at the press conference, they would not make the host and reporters exhausted; and the reporters would not have to painstakingly delete and abandon many good materials when writing their稿s at home.

A Smoky and Dirty Dining Hall

Here, I would like to mention those unpleasant press conferences. After the heads of the various branch offices of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration came to Shanghai, the translation office of the office often held press conferences. The intention was certainly good, but the place where these press conferences were held was often the dining hall of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Because it was next to the kitchen, the cooking smoke often made the world change color. Often, the place where the uncrowned emperors are entertained becomes a smoky and dirty place. As for whether there is still grease under the white tablecloth, although I dare not say, the air is indeed filled with sweet, salty, and even greasy ingredients.

Also, General Chennault's press conferences were often a bit scary. Because this man heard too many airplane sounds, he was a bit deaf in both ears. Sometimes, even if you try your best to "yell" the question, he still doesn't hear it; and it is even more common for him to answer irrelevantly.

The Most Terrible Time

However, the most terrible press conference was the report of the ×× Bureau held in the New Life Club on the eve of Journalists' Day. It was really a case where none of the three elements of timing, location, and people were favorable. Speaking of "timing," Ambassador Stuart happened to be in Shanghai that day, and everyone was very busy, and many people had other appointments at 6:00 PM. Unexpectedly, Director × of the Bureau was first an hour late, and then talked endlessly - but in fact, he already had a detailed written report. Speaking of "location," someone happened to be holding a wedding at the New Life Club that day, and it was only a wall away from the place where the press conference was held. Inside, the report was being given happily, while outside, the band was playing enthusiastically. As a result, the reporters laughed at the director - if they didn't laugh like this, his report might have ended even later. As for "people," I think I'll be kind and not say it. But I might as well mention it in general: when dealing with journalists, "sincerity" is better than "smoothness" after all. The worst is a really sincere honest person who insists on learning to be smooth - and the result is what Shanghainese call a "tofu target," or in English, a Bore.

### Difficulty in Handling Illegal Assets - A Small Amount of Living Expenses for Family Members to Be Discussed - Many Houses Are Occupied and Few People Buy Them

[Report from Our Newspaper] The biggest difficulty for the Illegal Assets Handling Group of the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau in handling illegal assets is that the Ministry of Justice has not yet responded to the method of retaining living expenses for family members from confiscated illegal assets. At the same time, handling illegal assets takes a long time. It is necessary to wait until the person who has been judged to be an illegal person no longer appeals, or the appeal has been rejected, before the court sends the judgment to the Illegal Assets Handling Committee for execution. Currently, the properties of Chen Gongbo, Miao Bin, Chu Minyi, Yang Jie, and Mei Siping are being processed. The method of handling is to put the confiscated illegal assets up for sale on the one hand, and to investigate whether there is any concealment on the other hand, and to reward those who secretly report it. On the other hand, the situation of the family members of each illegal person is being investigated. However, bidding is also very difficult, because most of the houses are occupied and few people buy them. Regarding the assets of each illegal person, they are entrusted to the Handling Bureau by the judicial organs for safekeeping. After the Handling Bureau seals them up, they are entrusted to the Central Trust Bureau for safekeeping, and the Trust Bureau entrusts the current occupants for safekeeping. The furniture and other items in the illegal assets are all registered and verified by the Trust Bureau, and the current occupants are responsible for safekeeping.

It is also learned that when the Illegal Assets Handling Committee meets this Friday afternoon, it may discuss the issue of retaining living expenses for family members from confiscated illegal assets. Because the amount of illegal assets varies greatly. If a certain amount of living expenses is stipulated, the total value of some illegal assets may not even be enough to cover this amount. If a percentage is stipulated, then one-thousandth of some illegal assets would be enough for their family members to live a luxurious life. Therefore, this problem is very difficult to solve.

### Broadway Mansion Not for Sale - To Be Used as the Shanghai Site of the Lizi Society

It was previously proposed to sell the Broadway Mansion on the north side of the Waibaidu Bridge. According to the person in charge of handling enemy and puppet assets, the proposal to sell the mansion has been decided to be cancelled. It will be taken over by the Ministry of National Defense and used as the Shanghai site of the Lizi Society to entertain family members of military and political dignitaries and foreign guests. Currently, the mansion is managed and used by the US military, and the Central Trust Bureau Real Estate Office collects the rent for the shops on the ground floor on a monthly basis. It is said that the mansion will be taken over by the Lizi Society in the near future.

### China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiangjing Wheel Will Join the Shanghai-Ningbo Line

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai-Ningbo money ferry has been the first to resume sailing after the victory. It has been smooth and unimpeded for more than a year. The original four wheels, Jiangya, Dahua, Chuanshan, and Jiangsu, operate, with ships traveling back and forth every day. In order to enrich the Shanghai-Ningbo line, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has now dispatched the Jiangjing Wheel to participate in the sailing. The wheel is slightly larger than the Jiangya Wheel, with a total of more than 3,700 tons. It has been painted at the Rui Rong Factory for more than a month and is brand new. It will set sail immediately. After the Jiangjing Wheel starts running, the Jiangya Wheel will depart from Shanghai on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and the Jiangjing Wheel will depart from Shanghai on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. Except for Sundays, the bureau has ships traveling back and forth every day.

### There Are Still Many Mad Dog Bites - The Police Station Intensifies the Killing

[Report from Our Newspaper] Recently, many citizens in various districts of the city have been bitten by dogs. If they are not sent to the hospital immediately, the consequences will be dire. Moreover, the transmission is extremely rapid, and the victims often neglect minor injuries, which is very dangerous. The city authorities have issued a detailed statement that if there are cases of dogs biting people, the dog owner and the person who was bitten or their family members should immediately report to the nearby police station and get vaccinated at a specialized hospital. The dog should be captured and sent to the Mad Dog Inspection Institute at No. 10 Shajing Road Municipal Slaughterhouse for inspection. If it is healthy, it will be returned; otherwise, it will be captured and killed. In addition, the police station is now adding manpower and intensifying the killing of stray dogs.

[Another Report] The Health Bureau issued a public announcement yesterday that the number of citizens who developed major infectious diseases in September was 43 with dysentery, 65 with typhoid fever, and 127 with cholera, with 13 deaths. In addition, the Epidemic Prevention Committee is scheduled to hold a general meeting next week to conduct a general review of the epidemic prevention work this year and discuss the various important matters that the bureau should handle after the autumn.

### A Man Commits Suicide by Hanging at Jiaotong University

[Report from Our Newspaper] A man who committed suicide by hanging was suddenly found at Jiaotong University in Xujiahui yesterday morning. It was rumored that he was a student of the school.

He came to Shanghai from his hometown on the 28th of last month and went to Professor Zhang Yousheng of the school, begging for a job but failing. He temporarily resided in the school building. Due to economic pressure, he committed suicide. The court has been notified for inspection.

### Australian Envoy to China Speaks on the Issue of Full Employment

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Australian Envoy to China, Mr. Copland, gave a speech on the issue of democratic countries and full employment at the British Chamber of Commerce at 12:30 PM yesterday. He said that in the two world wars, the problem of unemployment had become an important issue in most democratic countries, and countries such as Britain, the United States, Canada, Norway, and the Netherlands were not immune. He then elaborated on the importance of employment in the economic position and said that Australia has always firmly believed in the importance of high employment as an important goal of international economic policy in various international conferences in the past four years. High employment also implies a greater amount of international trade. This is because all countries need a large amount of imports. He concluded by saying that the employment policy will not only have a significant impact on the material conditions of the people, but it is also a touchstone for whether democratic countries are sufficient to meet the reasonable expectations of free people.

### Soldier Run Over and Killed by Military Vehicle

The officer corps has requested compensation from the garrison headquarters and is punishing the murderer.

### Revival of American Goods Stalls: City God Temple Transformed: Glass-Enclosed United Market Established; Prosperity of Creek Mouth Road Resurrected Today

[Special Report from This Newspaper]! Wild grasses can never be burnt out; the spring breeze brings them to life again – although it is not springtime now, the American goods peddlers who were once severely suppressed have revived like wild grass under a spring breeze, driven by a strong desire to survive. Apart from those who continue to appear furtively in the streets and alleys in a "guerrilla" fashion, the only difference is that the "wild grass" has gained legal status and has been transplanted into a "bonsai in a greenhouse."

From the bustling Creek Mouth Road to the concrete organization of the World United Market, the vendors' resourcefulness is fully displayed. For the sake of livelihood, they are unwilling to give up this line of business. If the authorities suppressed them because they obstructed traffic, they are willing to find another suitable location to concentrate in one place; if they are a loophole for smuggling, they are willing to no longer accept smuggled goods; if they affect legitimate businesses, they are willing to issue invoices and pay business taxes. They offered these conditions, and after repeated requests, the municipal authorities finally agreed to resume business. Thus, with the help of Mr. Huang Jinrong, they rented the address of the City God Temple's Small World Amusement Park to establish the World United Market, which officially opened yesterday.

Walking through the festively decorated gate, ascending to the second floor, on both sides are portraits, one of the chairman and one of the late Premier, filled with congratulatory banners, and flower baskets covering the corners. Recalling the embarrassing situation of being suppressed a month ago, isn't life like a play? Going inside, what a lively scene! Uniform glass cabinets, every three forming a unit, each unit has a shop number and a sign, written on uniform rectangular glass suspended from the ceiling by ropes. All kinds of American goods are piled up and crammed into the glass cabinets, people squeeze around, and the prosperity of Creek Mouth Road has reappeared today. Prices are still relatively cheap: a bottle of 100 cod liver oil capsules costs only 3,500 yuan, and a large bottle of Gu Ling Yu can be bought for 1,500 yuan. One cabinet displays several shiny, red and green "glass ties"; asking the price, they are 8,000 yuan each. The clerk introduces with a boastful tone: "They cost more than 10,000 on Avenue Joffre!"

The entire market has 264 glass cabinets, in groups of three, for a total of 88 groups, all under the jurisdiction of the General Management Office. The organization of the General Management Office can be said to be "small but complete." Like a small agency, it is divided into five sections, with a section chief and staff in charge. Next to the staircase leading to the back door, the inspection section has dispatched two people to guard it all day long. All the goods brought in by each unit must pass through this inspection to verify the invoices to avoid the mixing in of smuggled goods; it seems that the management is quite strict.

Their business licenses are obtained by the General Management Office in the name of the United Market, and the Finance Bureau collected 75,000 yuan in license fees. All expenses are shared jointly. This time, the decoration costs for opening each group were about 500,000 yuan, and the monthly rent thereafter is 3 million yuan in total, with each glass cabinet only bearing more than 10,000 yuan, so their expenses are still more economical than those of formal stores. Moreover, having obtained legal status, they no longer need to provide illegal demands. The only drawback is that they are farther from the central district. It is said that in the near future, two similar markets, "Asia" and "Dragon Gate," will also appear on Avenue President Chiang Kai-shek. The two images above are the market gate and merchandise (taken by this newspaper).

### Silk Store Goes Bankrupt After Only a Few Days, Losing Over 100 Million Yuan

[Report from This Newspaper] Jiu Hua Xiang Silk and Cloth Store at 223 Avenue du Père Robert, which had just opened in late last month, suddenly went bankrupt yesterday before the week was over, owing legal tender amounting to a huge sum of over 100 million yuan. The store owners, Xi Juru and Quan Wei, have both fled without a trace. Various creditors have filed reports with the police station, requesting an investigation into the fraudulent use of a false name.

### Son of Merchant Commits Fraud After Running Out of Money

[Report from This Newspaper] Zhang Shunxiang (23 years old), son of Shanghai merchant Zhang Shangda of 25 Yuxing Lane, Avenue du Père Labouré, recently became inextricably linked with Yan Hua, a dancing girl at the Lido Dance Hall, and rented a large room at the Weida Hotel, causing financial strain. Therefore, he had to find other sources of income, and under the pretext of ordering jeeps, he successively defrauded his friends Cai Leiren, Mr. Chen, and several others of more than 3,000 US dollars, spending it extravagantly. After Cai and others urged him repeatedly, Zhang avoided seeing them. Cai and others then realized they had been deceived and reported to the police station, requesting an investigation.

### Eliminating Disasters: Important Anti-Theft Information

[Report from This Newspaper] Recently, the trend of theft in this city has resurged. In addition to making efforts to prevent and arrest thieves, the police department has also formulated important anti-theft information, hoping that all citizens of the city will pay attention to it in order to eliminate disasters before they occur and reduce harm invisibly.

For Residents

(1) From sunset onwards, the front and back doors should be tightly closed to prevent unexpected events. (2) If someone knocks on the door, ask clearly who it is and never open the door easily, lest criminals take the opportunity to break in. (3) If there are several iron gates in each lane, one can be opened each night for entry and exit, to avoid increasing the criminals' activity routes. (4) If a peephole can be installed on the door, the knocker can be seen before the door is opened. It costs little and is very effective. (5) An electric bell can be installed in the indoor secretary's office to contact neighbors. In case of an accident, it can alert neighbors to report for assistance. (6) Be careful when hiring servants and ask for a guarantor. (7) Pay attention to the people who interact with the servants. (8) Pay attention to the neighbors in the same house and the people they interact with. (9) Do not expose wealth or valuables, lest they be coveted by criminals without knowing it. (10) Do not let children stray far from home, to avoid being noticed by criminals. (11) Usually pay attention to those who falsely claim to be visiting friends, delivering letters, or checking and repairing electricity, telephones, and tap water to enter the house without permission.

For Shops

(1) Alarm bells should be installed so that the police can be notified immediately in case of theft or robbery. (2) Employees should be carefully selected. (3) Be wary of the words and actions of customers to prevent accidents. (4) Handle incoming and outgoing cash properly and do not place it on the table to attract the attention of criminals. (5) An iron gate should be installed at the entrance and exit next to the counter to prevent outsiders from entering. (6) Pay attention to the people who interact with the shop assistants.

For Pedestrians

(1) Do not go out easily at night unless there are important events. (2) Do not walk on deserted roads or paths. (3) When taking a car, pay attention to the license plate number and the driver's appearance. (4) Pay attention to the objects you are carrying when getting on and off trams and buses. (5) When it is necessary to go out at night, avoid carrying valuables or ornaments.

For the General Public

(1) In the event of theft or robbery, try to remain calm and pay close attention to the thief's appearance, characteristics, clothing, accent, and the guns they are holding. (2) If you find that a thief has entered the house and there is still room to deal with it, you should try to sneak out and report to the police, or shout for help by the window. Also, if you can take the opportunity to turn off the main power switch and then report to the police, you can cause the thief to flee in a panic. (3) After a theft, do not touch the fingerprints left on the smooth furniture and utensils that the thief touched. If the thief fires a warning shot, pay attention to the location and look for bullet casings and bullets. (4) After being stolen, immediately go out and secretly follow the fleeing thief, and immediately report to the nearby police on duty. (5) After the thieves have escaped, immediately report to the police station to find a way to investigate and arrest them.

### Shanghai Ferry Company to Hold Inaugural Meeting This Month; Five-Year Plan Proposed to Increase Docks and Ferries; Prosper Pudong and Attract Residents to Move In

[Report from This Newspaper] The Shanghai Ferry Company, jointly operated by the government and merchants, has been under preparation since May of this year. Due to currency fluctuations, the estimation of the total capital and the value of government shares has been affected several times, which has delayed the establishment. The initial capital was planned to be 1 billion yuan, then increased to 1.2 billion yuan, and most recently increased to 1.5 billion yuan, which has been submitted to the Municipal Council for discussion and approval. Among them, government shares account for one-third, totaling 500 million yuan in national currency, which is offset by all the remaining assets of the former ferry company received by the Public Utilities Bureau after the victory. The remaining 1 billion yuan will be raised by the Bank of Communications and ten other private banks, and it has now begun. According to Mr. Zhang Huikang, director of the company's preparatory office, the inaugural meeting can be held within this month.

Although the Municipal Ferry Company has not yet been formally established, in fact, all the work has been actively carried out by the preparatory office. In addition to restoring (1) the Changdu Songhu Line from Shanghai to Wusong, (2) the Dui Jiang Dongdong Line from Dongmen Road to Dongchang Road, and (3) the Dui Jiang Qichang Line from Qichangzhan to Qinhuangdao Road, the Dui Jiang Tangxun Line from Dongjiadu to Tangqiao has also resumed operation yesterday. The Dui Jiang Kaiding Line from Dinghai Bridge to Mudu Temple is expected to resume within this year. In addition, the company has also formulated a five-year plan to increase the construction of docks and ferries in stages for the purpose of prospering Pudong. The outline of the plan is as follows:

To be completed in 1947: (1) Increase the Dui Jiang ferry line at the South Wharf, (2) Kashi Over-River Line, from Lan Road to Yangjingbang. First build one ferry, and gradually add up to four. When there are four ferries, 3,000 trucks can be transported daily. (3) Test run the Dui Jiang Chunbei Line, from Beijing Road Wharf to Chunjiang Wharf. (4) Add Dui Jiang ferries.

To be completed in 1948: (1) Increase the Dui Jiang ferry line at Minsheng Road, (2) Changdu Nanhang Line, from Beijing Road Wharf to Longhua Port. (3) Improve the Dui Jiang Dudu Line. Chunbei Line, find a suitable location in Puxi, and plan to use the Japan-China Spinning Factory wharf in Pudong to build double-decker ferries to attract residents of Puxi to move to Pudong. If these double-decker ferries are increased to three, they can carry 100,000 passengers per day.

To be completed in 1949: (1) Increase the Dui Jiang ferry line at Zhoujiadu, (2) Increase the truck crossing line at the South Wharf, (3) Improve all long-distance Changdu lines, (4) Add large Changdu ferries.

To be completed in 1950: (1) Increase the Dui Jiang ferry line at Yangjiadu, (2) Continue to build large Changdu ferries, (3) Continue to improve the Dui Jiang Chunbei Line and Dongdong Line, (4) Add three double-decker Dui Jiang ferries, one of which will be used for the Dongdong Line and two for the Chunbei Line.

To be completed in 1951: (1) Increase the Dui Jiang ferry line at Yangjinggang, (2) Increase the truck crossing line at Dongmen Road.

Tangdong Line Resumes Operation Yesterday

[Another Report] The Pujiang Tangxun Line, which is a ferry line between Dongjiadu in Puxi and Tangqiao in Pudong, has a dense population on both sides and frequent travel. The preparatory office of the Municipal Ferry Company, which is in charge of Pujiang transportation, has been planning to restore it for a long time. The only reason is that the original Dongjiadu Wharf is close to the road, and there is no space in the middle, which is very inconvenient for passengers to get on and off. In addition, the siltation along the Pudong River is particularly serious, and the dredging project is too large. Therefore, the Gongyi Wharf has been re-surveyed as the special wharf for the Municipal Ferry and redesigned and built. It is now learned that since the active preparation of the line, all the projects have been completed. The area near the new wharf has also been entrusted to the Junpu Bureau to dredge it on its behalf. Therefore, from the first day of this month, ferries were assigned to officially resume operation. It is also heard that the Municipal Ferry authorities, in view of the fact that the line has always been an important route for Pudong vegetable vendors to cross the river, have specially advanced the daily sailing time as much as possible. The schedule stipulates that there will be one departure every 15 minutes from 3 a.m. to 8 p.m. According to reports, this line and the Dongdong Line are both important routes in the southern section of the Pujiang River. Once restored, it will be more convenient for citizens crossing the river to Pudong. In addition, the company's "Jiangsu" ferry was occupied by the enemy and severely damaged. It has now been repaired and will join the Beijing Road Bund and Wusong lines next week, with a speed of 11 nautical miles per hour.

### Reader Responses: Medicine and Health

(1) Neurasthenia

Liu Li asks: I now have several medical questions, I pray for your answers: (1) If a young man suffers from spermatorrhea and kidney deficiency, is it reasonable to replenish the kidneys? (2) What are the tonic properties of hormones? Are they only for aphrodisiacs? Can young people use them? (3) Some people have preconceived notions and firmly believe that the ingredients of Vita-Spermin are all aphrodisiacs and can only be used by the elderly and not by the young. Is this statement accurate? (4) Young people who suffer from neurasthenia, kidney weakness, and physical weakness, are there any side-effect-free injections? Please advise me.

[Medical Doctor Yu Qi answers] (1) Only one case of spermatorrhea per month is not a disease. If it occurs frequently, it proves that the body is weak and the kidneys are deficient. You must take blood-tonifying and strengthening drugs, and multiple vitamin pills, etc. (2) Hormones are drugs that replenish internal secretions. Young people sometimes need to use them, which is determined by a doctor. (3) (4) You must take oral blood-tonifying and brain-tonifying medicine, and you can also inject blood-tonifying injections, etc.

(2) Childhood Paralysis

Zhang Kecheng asks: My child is now five years old and suffered from encephalomyelitis in March 1944. After recovery, his left hand and left foot became paralyzed and could not move. In July of the same year, he was treated by an acupuncture doctor, but it was ineffective. In September, he went to Puren Hospital in Wuxi for treatment and was diagnosed with anterior poliomyelitis. Thirty-odd injections of vitamin B1 were administered, but sometimes he developed chills and fever, which were also ineffective. In the spring of 1945, his left foot could move slightly, and by winter, his left hand could also be gradually lifted, but he still could not move freely. Who knew that in recent months, he suddenly showed a trembling state when walking, lasting for one minute. May I ask: (1) Is this symptom epilepsy? (2) What medicines can cure it? (3) If it is not treated, to what extent will the symptoms develop? (4) Can this symptom be expected to improve by adulthood?

[Medical Doctor Gu Yuqi answers] (1) This symptom is not epilepsy. (2) You must come to Shanghai and consult a neurologist for research and treatment. (3) There is a chance of cure. (4) It can be expected to improve.

Adoption of Newborn Infant

Editor: I admire your newspaper for serving the public. I have a request: I came to Shanghai from the rear. My service organization has been downsized, causing me to be laid off. My family has a large number of dependents, with five children, boys and girls. My wife is about to give birth within ten days. Due to difficult living conditions, I am unable to afford it. Therefore, I plan to send the newborn, whether male or female, to a reliable family without children for adoption. If interested, please send a letter to Chong Shou, c/o Yonglong Silver Shop at the intersection of North Shaanxi Road and Tiantong Road, so that I can send the infant. This is a last resort.

### Evaluation System; Cotton Fabric Industry Responds First; Raw Fabrics from Wuxi and Changzhou Are Higher Than Those in Shanghai; Leading Brands Doing 100,000 Yuan But No Goods Available

[Report from This Newspaper] The fabric market was still stable yesterday. It opened in the morning with a rising trend, but due to monetary issues, procurement turned silent and sales also became sluggish. Fangjian's release of fabric for sale, the working capital of fellow traders, mostly remains for use after approval to purchase. Leading fine cloth is doing 100,000 yuan, with a lack of goods for supply. Wufu is doing 91,000 yuan, poplin is a little under 3,000 yuan. The release price for Fangjian's goods, fine cloth increased by 2,000 yuan, poplin is at the original price. Fine cloth 3A color ball and Wufu Xiantao are both 80,000 yuan. Specialty cloth shops, Qingdao goods, Five-Star City cloth, are supplied to dyeing factories for purchase, at the same price as fine cloth. The market situation in the afternoon was downstream, with prices falling by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Poplin has entered the 100,000 yuan range, and fine cloth has entered the 90,000 yuan range.

Since the mayor convened a discussion the day before yesterday and instructed to suppress and stabilize prices, the Cotton Fabric Industry Association immediately convened a joint meeting of supervisors and directors yesterday. The representatives who attended the municipal government meeting stated the mayor's intention. All those in charge expressed anxiety. It was decided to hire elders and leaders in the industry to form an evaluation committee to study concrete countermeasures. The Southern Association's autumn sacrifice is on the 6th of this month, and fellow traders are expected to have a beautiful gathering. It is heard that they will solicit opinions on the spot to adjust supply and demand and balance market prices. After the meeting, according to a certain authoritative person, the rising trend of fabric prices is indeed not small. Only by suppressing the high profits of the original manufacturers, reducing the added cost of repeated buying and selling, reducing interest rates, and advancing the delivery period of manufacturers can the losses incurred by vendors be reduced, transportation be facilitated, and the hidden losses in bidding and allocation of goods be avoided. Moreover, it is said that the middle-ten days of the month are the peak season for actual sales in the gold-nine-silver-ten months. Because of the high prices of goods from other ports, the fabric prices in this city will rise accordingly. According to its revealed news, the raw fabrics produced by yarn factories in Changzhou and Wuxi were originally one of the important sources for this city. Recently, prices in these places have continued to rise. At the end of last week, 20-count yarn in that production area was around 2.4 million yuan per piece. Some fabric factories have to hand over one piece of yarn to exchange for eleven pounds of fine cloth and 23 pieces of fabric, then the price of each piece has reached more than 100,000 yuan, which is more expensive than in this city. It is also heard that most dyeing and weaving factories have reduced their inventory in September, with some making explicit profits and others suffering implicit losses. Fabric shops have recently had two in Nanyang Bridge and Dapu Bridge that were crushed by high-interest loans, and due to the rapid rise in prices, they were unable to replenish after selling out, and finally declared bankruptcy. The joy and suffering are uneven.

### Ministry of Finance Replies to Chamber of Commerce Telegram: Differential Exchange Rates Difficult to Implement Crackdown on Luxury Goods Awaits Overall Planning

The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, for the current tariff and foreign exchange system, telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance and Economics, listing (1) stepping up the crackdown on imports of non-essential and luxury goods, (2) adopting a foreign exchange grading system, and (3) striving to formulate commercial treaties suitable for the entire trade policy, in order to save the economic crisis. Yesterday, it received a telegram reply from the Ministry of Finance, promising to consider and plan for the three points requested. The original text of the Ministry of Finance's reply telegram is recorded as follows:

According to the Agency Letter No. 22 dated July 9, 1946, the current tariff policy and exchange settlement methods cannot be coordinated with the principles of economic construction, and three methods are proposed for selection and implementation, etc. The Ministry has checked that promoting the import of essential goods and suppressing the import of luxury goods is the principle that should be followed for reconstruction and construction. For this principle to be implemented as an administrative order, it is necessary to carefully examine the types and quantities of imported goods in order to take reasonable measures. This year's import trade has gradually increased, and examining the import statistics of Jianghai Customs in May, the total import value was 81.3 billion yuan in national currency, of which construction equipment such as engines, railway passenger cars, freight cars, sleepers, and vehicle parts, and industrial raw materials such as cotton, hardware ingots, chemical products, dyes, leather, and rubber, totaled 61.1 billion yuan, accounting for about three-quarters of the total import value. The remaining one-quarter, with cotton cloth, medicines, oils, and paper as the main items, are also materials suitable for current economic needs. As for luxury goods, they have been strictly cracked down on in accordance with the ban issued by the government, and investigations and seizures have been strengthened to prevent smuggling. Now, regarding the design of imported goods, the government has established an Import Design Committee under the Supreme Economic Committee to comprehensively review and plan. The first item suggested by the chamber, stepping up the crackdown on imports of non-essential and luxury goods, etc., should be waited for the government to investigate and plan as a whole. Also, the second item originally suggested, adopting a foreign exchange grading system, etc., after investigation, the implementation of differential exchange rates has many difficulties. In order to encourage exports and balance import trade, the government has adjusted foreign exchange rates and specially approved exemptions from export taxes. As for the third item originally suggested, commercial treaties should be formulated to suit the entire trade policy, and the opinions of the national industry and commerce should be collected before signing the treaties in order to show seriousness. According to the previous situation, in addition to the branch, it is appropriate to inform you by telegram.

### City Schools' Levy of "Respect the Teacher" Fees Violates City Council Resolution; Reportedly, the Mayor Will Order a Stop to the Collection

The collection of "respect the teacher" fees by municipal schools in this city has been met with opposition from all sectors. The City Council has proposed as many as seven motions regarding this matter, the reasons being: Public national schools should not collect tuition fees, as clearly stipulated by law. The collection of "respect the teacher" fees by municipal primary schools is a disguised form of tuition, which violates the central government's fundamental principle of universal national education. Municipal secondary schools already have tuition fee regulations, and the additional collection of "respect the teacher" fees is a double burden that citizens cannot bear. At a time when the people are impoverished and many are out of school, how can the government turn a blind eye? Three measures were established: (1) Municipal primary schools shall no longer collect disguised tuition fees under any name. (2) Municipal secondary schools shall not arbitrarily collect "respect the teacher" fees. (3) The base salaries of municipal school teachers may be adjusted and increased by the Education Bureau in accordance with fair principles. The general assembly resolved: Please instruct the municipal government to order municipal schools to stop collecting "respect the teacher" fees in order to ease the burden on citizens. It has been reported that municipal schools continue to collect "respect the teacher" fees, in violation of the City Council's resolution. It is reported that Mayor Wu is also dissatisfied with this and has instructed the Education Bureau to order the schools to stop collecting fees.

[Another Report] National education is compulsory education, and the Ministry of Education has repeatedly issued orders to restrict fees. However, the local education authorities in this city have come up with a novel idea: all municipal national schools collect "respect the teacher" fees, 30,000 yuan per student for senior primary schools, and 20,000 yuan per student for junior primary schools and kindergartens. They arbitrarily collect fees under fabricated names, which violates the fundamental principle of national education. During the City Council meeting last month, many councilors questioned Li Ximou, Deputy Director of the Education Bureau, orally. At that time, Deputy Director Li was unable to defend himself and had no answer. Subsequently, the City Council passed a resolution: National schools shall not collect disguised tuition fees – "respect the teacher" fees. Recently, municipal national schools have not complied with the resolution and have instead forced students' families to pay "respect the teacher" fees within a limited time. If they do not pay, they will be expelled from school. It is reported that the education authorities intend to continue collecting "respect the teacher" fees before the City Council's resolution is delivered, claiming "the early bird catches the worm." The reporter believes that this measure not only violates the City Council's resolution but also neglects the responsibilities of educational administration. Deputy Director Li was present when the City Council proposed this motion, but he turned a deaf ear and did not stop it, which is deeply不满 by the citizens of the entire city. Furthermore, it is reported that municipal schools have decided to continue collecting "respect the teacher" fees for this semester, but children of public education personnel can request exemptions. It is reported that the municipal primary schools have begun notifying students' parents to start collecting fees as of yesterday. According to a report by the Mainland News Agency reporter, some teachers told students, "If you do not pay the 'respect the teacher' fee, your conduct score may be deducted."

### Jiaotong University Staff and Students Going North Rush to Register

The youth leagues of Tangshan Jiaotong University and Beiping Jiaotong University established a service station in Shanghai to assist in the restoration after the war, and have successively sent eight batches of staff and students. It is reported that the seventh batch of registered staff and students will take the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Fuel Committee coal ship Helga Moller north on the fifth of this month, and the procedures for the eighth batch (old students from both schools and new students from Tangshan) are being rushed through. The station originally planned to stop registration on September 30 and close down, but more than 100 staff and students from afar have not yet arrived in Shanghai, and new students from Beiping Jiaotong University have been unable to complete registration and boarding procedures due to the late release of admission lists. Therefore, the registration deadline for ship berths has been extended to the sixth of this month. Faculty, staff, and new and old students from both schools can go to the station at No. 180 Xiamen Road in this city to register before the sixth of this month.

### Southeast United University to Organize Alumni Association

Since the Pacific War, patriotic young students in Shanghai have moved inland one after another. The Ministry of Education established the National Southeast United University in Jinhua to accommodate teachers and students who had withdrawn from Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Macau. He Bingsong, President of Jinan University, and Hu Jianzhong, President of the Southeast Daily, presided over the preparations. Before two months had passed, the enemy invaded, and the entire faculty and students of Jinlan safely retreated to Jianguan on foot under the leadership of President He. The Ministry of Education ordered Southeast United University to merge into Jinan University and Yingshi University, respectively. The students were sadly dispersed, but it was of great significance in the history of wartime education. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, they have returned to Shanghai one after another and jointly initiated the organization of an alumni association to share old friendships. All alumni of the United University can register at Zhou Qizhong (First Section, Civil Affairs Office, Police Headquarters, Zhouzhou Road, telephone 17590-13), Shi Meixuan (Heng Heng Hardware Store, Puan Lane, Yongan Street, telephone 85755), and Lu Derun (Chengde Company, Room 412, Guohua Building, 356 Beijing Road, telephone 97551) in order to convene a general meeting on a selected date.

### Scholarship Basketball Benefit Game: Ever-Victorious Army Unstoppable; Qunsheng Defeats Giants Again; Wu Yusi 35 Points, Giants' Defense Shattered; Wang Xuezhe Buys Charity Ball for 2.5 Million

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Qunsheng and Giants teams played a charity basketball game yesterday at the Municipal Gymnasium at 8:00 p.m. to raise scholarship funds. The order yesterday was excellent. The deployment of military police was justified, but the removal of all the leather chairs in the stadium to accommodate twice as many spectators was a successful attempt. As a result of the game, the beginning was tense, but afterwards, due to superior ability, Qunsheng easily won with a score of 52 to 35. The first half was 27 to 17, with Qunsheng also leading. At the end of the first half, Wang Weijun hosted an auction of a charity ball, starting with a price of 350,000. After bidding, the philanthropist Wang Xuezhe, president of the Student Daily, bought it for 2.5 million yuan, benefiting the students, which is commendable. At the end of the third quarter, Chen Ruhui, director of the Loan Fund Committee, reported the income, totaling 13,116,000 yuan.

Performance Captivates

Yesterday, the Giants adopted a man-to-man defense, showing a decisive determination. The first quarter was still tight. From the second quarter onwards, Qunsheng used all their skills, such as the fake enticement of Zhang Wenzhang, Chen Jinde, and Cai Wenhua, which was very threatening and the opponent was bound to fall into their trap, which was wonderful and captivating. In yesterday's game, Cai Wenzhang had the greatest success. With his short stature, he was able to disrupt the ball that the enemy had already obtained and used wonderful passes to block. All of this was a magical performance, and there are simply no words to describe its characteristics. After seven major battles, it has been proven that there is a difference between the Qunsheng team and the teams in Shanghai. The Giants cannot stop its edge. There are still two battles against Enkas and Hualian. In addition to predicting their victory, we are very willing to see more transcendent performances.

As If Entering No Man's Land

Yesterday, the first players to appear were Chen Jinde, Chen Jinzhi, Cai Wenhua, Cai Wenzhang, and Yang Renhui for Qunsheng, and Tao Bolinji, Funik, Stevenson, Sasskin, and Kaiji Milov for the Giants. Before the game, the Giants presented a pennant, which was accepted by Qunsheng captain Chen Jinde. At 8:00 p.m., the whistle blew to start the game. Tao Bolinji raised his hands and scored first, and the audience applauded. Qunsheng captain Chen immediately returned the favor, and Cai Wenhua followed suit, leading 4 to 2. Funik dribbled in, forcing a tie at 4 to 4. Then Tao Bolinji scored twice, and Qunsheng's Wenzhang and Jinde each scored once, resulting in a tie of 6 to 6 and 8 to 8. At the end of the first quarter, the visitors led by one point at 10 to 8.

Another Battle Begins, Voices Rise

The Giants replaced Sasskin with Yelong. Qunsheng used all their skills, and Chen Jinzhi, Cai Wenhua, and Chen Jinde seemed to enter no man's land, and the score rose rapidly. In an instant, they led with 22 to 9, letting the kite fly high. The Giants' Tao Bolinji raised his arms and shouted, repeatedly breaking through the basket, and Stevenson also contributed, and the score was slightly closer. At the end of the first half, the visitors led with 27 to 17.

Shooting Like a String of Pearls

After a break, the battle resumed. Qunsheng replaced Yang Renhui with Cai Lianke, and Cai Wenhua opened the scoring. Tao Bolinji immediately returned the color. Tao was in good form and scored two more goals in a row. Qunsheng called a timeout and then brought Renhui back onto the field, replacing Lianke. Jinzhi scored wonderfully, and Qunsheng ended the third quarter with 37 to 24.

In the last quarter, the Giants' N Sasskin scored the bullseye first. The Qunsheng players shot like a string of pearls, and Qunsheng led with 42 to 26. The Giants tried to rally, but Qunsheng pressed hard. When it was 49 to 30, the Giants' Stevenson fouled out for the fifth time, and Yelong replaced him again. When Cai Wenhua sprinted in and dribbled in, the bell rang loudly. As a result, Qunsheng defeated the Giants again with 52 to 35, reporting seven consecutive victories.

(Qunsheng) Fouls Points (Giants) Fouls Points

Chen Jinzhi Two Fifteen Tao Bolinji Three Seventeen

Cai Wenzhang One Five Yelong Zero Zero

Chen Jinde Two Thirteen N Sasskin One Four

Cai Wenhua Two Seventeen Funik One Seven

### Bumper Harvest in Zhejiang Province, Impressive Yields - A Special Dispatch from Hangzhou on the 24th by Correspondent Chu Yusheng

While the flames of war rage and people are mired in suffering elsewhere, Zhejiang Province has, on the whole, been peaceful and tranquil. This quiet province relies on agricultural production to maintain its reputation for prosperity. Although it is declared a grain-deficient province, most of its people still depend on rice paddies for their livelihoods. It is said that Zhejiang Province lacks accurate scientific statistics regarding its grain shortage. The calculation is based on an assumption that each of the 21 million people in Zhejiang consumes two "shi" (a unit of dry measure, approx. 120 lbs) of rice per year, totaling 42 million "shi" of rice. With an average annual yield of one and a half "shi" per mu (approx. 1/6 acre), Zhejiang Province can only claim to produce about 2 million "shi" of rice. Thus, these 2 million "shi" can only support the lives of 1 million people, while the remaining 20 million rely on rice imported from elsewhere. However, rice from Hsia-shih in Zhejiang is often transported to Shanghai, as well as Chia-ting, Chia-shan, and Ping-hu. Wenzhou, being near the sea, also ships rice to Shanghai. Therefore, roughly calculating, Zhejiang probably only has slightly over 1 million "dan" (another unit of dry measure, approx. 100 lbs) of rice. How can it sustain the lives of the entire province? Some say it is supplied by Jiangsu and Anhui provinces. Furthermore, there are many people living in the mountainous areas of Zhejiang who rely on coarse grains, such as sweet potatoes, corn, and wheat, for their sustenance.

Grain Shortage? Surplus Grain?

Zhejiang has 37,900,697 mu of farmland and 109,129,604 "shi mu" of mountainous land. The mountains are densely forested, and the farmland is rich with crops. Zhejiang rarely experiences famine disasters. Therefore, before we have accurate scientific statistics, we cannot definitively confirm whether there is a grain shortage or a surplus. Mr. Xia, who has served as an important advisor in Zhejiang for over ten years, told me: "The annual yield of rice paddies is based solely on estimation. There are no accurate statistics. Even if the province creates detailed charts and sends them to the counties, it's questionable whether the counties have specialized personnel to conduct the investigation. If they are sent to the townships, it's even more confusing. Therefore, to investigate the annual yield of rice paddies, it is necessary to first measure the land clearly, and then have the province directly dispatch personnel with expertise in both land administration and agriculture to investigate!" Thus, the reliability of all past figures is highly questionable.

After the war, it is even more chaotic. Some of the land survey registers are incomplete and need to be resurveyed. Many fields are barren and need to be reclaimed. In any case, if Zhejiang wants to maintain its reputation for prosperity, it must start by organizing its agriculture and achieving a balanced ratio of food supply.

Harvest Yields of 70% to 80%

During the transition from spring to summer this year, flash floods occurred in the upper reaches of the Qiantang River, inundating some of the rice paddies. During the hottest part of summer, pest infestations occurred in areas such as Yu-hang, Lin-an, Yu-qian, and Chang-hua. When the farmers, who depend on the weather for their livelihood, could find no assistance, they could only hope to protect their fields through welcoming gods and holding sacrificial ceremonies. Fortunately, things went smoothly. The water receded, the pests gradually diminished, and there was still a rice harvest. According to a certain senator from Yu-hang, Yu-hang still has about 70% to 80% of the usual yield. I visited the Department of Farmland and Food within the Department of Construction, and they all said that the overall harvest yield for the province this year is considered a bumper year, probably around 80%, or at least 70%!

We, of course, have the same doubts about this 70% to 80% harvest figure as we do about the "grain shortage" or "surplus." However, it can be said that it is "generally accurate." Now, we need to further study how this year's "bumper harvest" was formed. Was it because our government provided many methods for improving farming techniques? Did it build many water conservancy projects? Did it improve many fertilizers? Did it bring much joy to farmers' lives, either materially or spiritually?

More Assistance for Rural Areas

Upon closer examination, everything still depends on the common sense passed down by farmers for thousands of years, the superstitions passed down for thousands of years, such as the "Dragon King" and worshiping the "Field God and Field Goddess," and relying entirely on "favorable weather" to fortunately obtain this bumper harvest. This is something that those in government and those who enjoy the fruits of the city should deeply reflect upon.

Now, some early rice has already been harvested, while some fields have not yet been harvested. When the reporter was in the rear area in the Southwest, he initiated and took action to assist farmers in harvesting rice, which brought immense joy to the farmers. At this time, we believe that rural Zhejiang will also feel the strain of manpower. Many officers and soldiers in the cities, and many people in the cities, should also initiate efforts to assist farmers in harvesting rice. Help them according to the principles of not being overly demanding or wasteful, and they will feel extraordinarily comforted. Originally, today's metropolises were all built upon rural areas. If we do not integrate with the rural communities and allow them to collapse, then any metropolis will be destroyed invisibly.

Plowing Rice Roots for Scientific Farming

After the autumn harvest, we will enter the cold winter. Winter plowing is the best farming method because plowing the fields this winter, turning over the rice roots, will cause the hibernating insects to die underground, and the rotten rice roots can be used as fertilizer, making spring plowing easier next year and ensuring a good harvest in the fall. Therefore, this year's winter plowing is very important. We need to conduct good publicity in advance and hold a celebration in each township afterward to comfort these hardworking farmers.

Next spring, we need to research agricultural tools and provide widespread agricultural loans. After studying these agricultural tools, we need to promote their use. Agricultural loans must truly be placed in the hands of the farmers and absolutely not be exploited by intermediaries. We also need to organize the construction of various water conservancy projects and prepare insect-repellent powders and equipment early. If there is extra strength, the county magistrates of each county should personally go down to the villages to visit the farmers, solve their problems, improve their housing, or reduce their difficulties in clothing, food, and transportation, such as rationing reasonably priced fabrics and food, and building village roads. Furthermore, we need to hold many meaningful competitions, such as cattle plowing competitions, farmhouse cleanliness competitions, rural children's competitions, vegetable harvesting competitions, and fruit harvesting competitions.

The above is only a portion of the rural improvement initiatives. If we want to have results, it is not very difficult to do so. We must not always circle around in the cities, listening to the words of "those who speak on behalf of the people" all day long. We must personally go down to the countryside, personally see the actual difficulties and hardships, and then actually solve them for them.

Yes, to ensure that Zhejiang Province's farmland always yields a bumper harvest and its land always remains prosperous in the future, we must take the path of scientific improvement.

### A Brilliant New Page in Sino-Siamese Diplomatic Relations: A Grand Ceremony for Ambassador Li Presenting His Credentials

— A Dispatch from Bangkok on September 17th by Our Traveling Reporter Jie Sun

Intercourse between Siam and our country began in the Qin Dynasty, and by the Tang Dynasty, relations had become even closer. During the late Qing Dynasty, our country suffered many misfortunes, and the Siamese tributes were discontinued. Overseas Chinese in Siam number over three million. If we analyze their lineage, there are very few purely Siamese people. Those who hold prominent positions are all descendants of overseas Chinese. The Seventh King publicly acknowledged during a speech at a Chinese school in 1928 that he himself had Chinese ancestry. Siam's prosperity and development today are entirely due to the contributions of overseas Chinese. However, because our country was beset by internal unrest and external threats, overseas Chinese abroad were like orphaned children, subjected to others' bullying and humiliation. During the reign of Plaek Phibunsongkhram, the situation of overseas Chinese in Siam was particularly precarious. After the end of the war, our country sent a delegation to Siam, and after many negotiations, a treaty of friendship was finally signed. With the establishment of diplomatic relations, over three million overseas Chinese were also able to receive normal treatment and protection from now on. This can be called a brilliant page in our diplomatic history. After arriving in Bangkok on September 6, Li Tieh-cheng, our first ambassador to Siam, actively handled the affairs of opening the embassy. It was decided to hold a flag-raising ceremony on the 17th, and the Siamese side notified us that the credentials would be presented on the same day.

The Blue Sky with a White Sun Flag Rises to the Top of the Flagpole

On that day, the sky was clear and refreshing, and the national flags of China and Siam fluttered everywhere. All overseas Chinese were overjoyed and inspired. At exactly nine o'clock, the flag-raising ceremony began. Those who participated in this solemn and grand ceremony included all the staff of the embassy, representatives of over 270 overseas Chinese organizations, faculty and students of over 20 Chinese schools, and over 10,000 overseas Chinese. Ambassador Li, accompanied by Military Attaché Zhuo Hsien-shu, Consul-General Sun Ping-chien, Secretary Ouyang Chun, and Secretary Qin Wu, walked to the flagpole on the large lawn of the embassy. After everyone stood at attention, the ceremony began. First, the national anthem was sung, followed by the national flag anthem. Amidst the melodious singing, Ambassador Li slowly raised the brand-new, large national flag. When the Blue Sky with a White Sun flag rose to the top of the flagpole, which was over ten "zhang" (approx. 10 feet) tall, everyone bowed in salute. Ambassador Li then delivered a speech, stating: Today is the first day the embassy raises its national flag, and it is also the first day the Republic of China has an envoy stationed in this country. This day not only marks a new era in Sino-Siamese diplomatic history but also a new era in the history of relations between the two nations. As everyone knows, Siam is one of our major neighboring countries. Overseas Chinese have resided in this country for a long time. For thousands of years, the Chinese and Siamese people have lived in harmony, just like family. Whether in terms of culture, economy, bloodline, or even social life, both sides have established an inseparable relationship. In order to consolidate and enhance this relationship, our government sent a delegation to Siam at the beginning of this year, led by myself, to negotiate with the Siamese government and sign the Sino-Siamese Treaty of Friendship. This treaty is the foundation for establishing friendly diplomatic relations between China and Siam in the future. Now, although the foundation for Sino-Siamese diplomatic relations has been established, in order to promote even more friendly relations between China and Siam in the future... This historically valuable flag-raising ceremony was then declared complete. At 10:30 a.m., Pat Brem, Director of Protocol of the Siamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, arrived at our embassy with four specially prepared limousines to receive Ambassador Li. Ambassador Li and his party were greeted by two royal military attendants and a royal master of ceremonies. The master of ceremonies escorted Ambassador Li into the main hall.

Mutual Interests, Close Cooperation

After Ambassador Li performed the customary greeting and the Regent responded in kind, Ambassador Li stepped forward to present his credentials and read a eulogy: "Your Highness the Regent, I am deeply honored to present my credentials as the specially appointed plenipotentiary ambassador of the Republic of China. I respectfully request that Your Highness convey to His Majesty the King of Siam the sincere wishes of President Chiang for the prosperity of your country. At the same time, I am instructed to express, on behalf of the President, to your royal family, government, and people, our condolences and deep sympathy for the passing of the late King Ananda. The late King's benevolence was widely bestowed upon our overseas Chinese residing in your country, which has caused our people to deeply admire him. Upon hearing of his passing, our entire country mourned. China and Siam have long been linked by cultural, religious, economic, and blood ties. Since prehistoric times, Chinese people have immigrated to your country and settled here. Today, there are over three million Chinese descendants who can live in harmony with your country, just like family. This fact alone is enough to prove the existence of harmony and friendship between the two great nations. Indeed, the relationship between China and Siam has reached such a point that it should be regarded as that of brotherly countries. People from either country residing in the other should not be viewed as outsiders. Chinese residing in Siam and Siamese residing in China will be free to travel, reside, trade, hire workers, and engage in various occupations in their respective host countries without any restrictions. Furthermore, they will eternally enjoy the freedom of assembly, association, publication, and educating their children. This is my sincere hope. During the Japanese occupation of Siam, the Chinese government and its people not only expressed deep sympathy for the people of this country but also did their utmost to assist the Free Thai Movement, which bravely fought for national freedom and independence. I am pleased to be able to say this. In order to express its goodwill towards your government and recognizing the importance of close cooperation between the two countries on matters of mutual interest, the Chinese government has decided to send an ambassador to Siam. Since the common goal of both countries is peace and security, we can carry out reconstruction and construction work and build a better world. The Chinese government's foreign policy has no other purpose than this. In order to achieve this goal, our government is prepared to fully cooperate with your government. I consider it a rare privilege to be stationed in our brotherly neighboring country as the first diplomatic envoy of the Republic of China. However, what makes me particularly happy is that I had the good fortune to come to your country several months ago as the head of the delegation to Siam and to represent our government in signing the Sino-Siamese Treaty of Friendship, which codifies the long-standing friendship between China and Siam. This is especially gratifying to me. I fully understand the heavy responsibility that I am about to shoulder and am willing to do my utmost to fulfill my mission to the fullest extent possible, to cooperate with your government to enhance the closest relations between the two countries. This is not only necessary for maintaining peace and security in Asia but also beneficial for promoting the welfare of mankind." After Ambassador Li finished his speech, the Chairman of the Regency Council delivered a reply, stating: "In the name of the King of Siam, I am pleased to accept the credentials of Your Excellency as the Specially Appointed Plenipotentiary Ambassador of the Republic of China to the Kingdom of Siam. I extend the same sincere sentiments in response to President Chiang's wishes for prosperity. The King, royal family, and people of Siam are deeply grateful for President Chiang's condolences on the passing of the late King." After the Chairman of the Regency Council finished his reply, he introduced his officials who were present, and they exchanged pleasantries and shared champagne. The ceremony ended at 11:15 a.m. This new page in Sino-Siamese diplomatic history will forever remain an unforgettable memory in the hearts of over three million overseas Chinese.

### The Ghost Market in Xi'an

— A Dispatch from Xi'an on the 10th by Special Correspondent Li Chi

"Ghost Market"—this strange term sounds like the name of a horror movie, and this far from "elegant" and mysterious place is actually known to everyone in Xi'an. For example, if you take a rickshaw and say you want to go to "Min Le Yuan" (the real name of "Ghost Market"), you'll have to explain. If you say "Ghost Market," you can be sure there won't be any mistakes.

After getting off the Longhai Railway at Xi'an Station, you'll pass through the bustling Shangren Road on the way to the city center, where you'll find the entrance to "Ghost Market." The "heart" and "embryo" of "Ghost Market" was originally the small "Min Le Yuan," but I don't know when it started slowly expanding eastward, growing to its current size. If you were to measure it lengthwise or widthwise, it's probably over two "li" (approx. 2/3 mile) in length. To take a "horseback view" tour of this four- or five-square-li area, it would take at least one or two hours.

Dawn Breaks, Ghosts Disperse, the Market Closes

"Ghost Market" is a "market" in name and in fact. In short: goods from China and abroad, ancient and modern, are all available. Here are a few examples: In terms of clothing, from the glass raincoats and suspenders of young ladies and gentlemen to the tattered cotton-padded coats stripped from corpses of beggars. In terms of food and drink, from the colorful cans representing "Golden Round Culture" to the leftovers from restaurants and taverns from the previous night, everything is available. Other examples include brand-new bicycles and car parts of unknown origin, "surplus materials" that represent the crimes of the "Imperial Army," such as venereal disease preventatives specifically for American soldiers, European-made contraceptives that were more expensive than gold a year ago, and Shanghai's yellow "the more poisonous, the more effective" dog-skin plasters... everything you can think of. Even opium, a drug that trades in human lives, it seems no one dares to guarantee there are no shady, secretive transactions taking place within "Ghost Market."

The "market" is named "Ghost" because, according to local "researchers," in the beginning, petty thieves gathered in this area every day before dawn to sell stolen goods. When dawn broke, the "ghosts" dispersed and the "market" closed. From then on, the name "Ghost Market" spread by word of mouth and became known to everyone. Later, it became a daytime used goods market, a general flea market, and the only "personal property auction house" for refugees. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, it also served as a "clearinghouse" for the assets left behind by returning home. The "rise to prominence" of "Ghost Market" also came after the victory. Initially, many itinerant merchants went to Shanghai, Tianjin, and Henan to buy eastern goods to sell here at retail. Later, the scale and clout grew larger and larger. Today, it has become a center for wholesale of local and foreign goods, fabrics, and scrap materials. Many bosses who have very beautiful storefronts outside also set up stalls inside "Ghost Market." The busiest section is only a dozen or twenty feet long, with stalls on both sides stacked four to six deep. The first impression of walking into "Ghost Market" is that it's "crowded." The degree of "crowding" is comparable to that of the stock exchange.

Harmful Reverse Flow of Rural Trade

I don't know if there are any distorted markets like "Ghost Market" in other cities in China. It has nonstop transactions and sales 24 hours a day, but the "golden hours" are still before 9:00 a.m. Estimates suggest that the amount of money exchanged daily among the hundreds of wholesale merchants of foreign and miscellaneous goods and fabrics is enough to supply the entire annual budget of a province before the war. In terms of buyers, it's "nothing strange" for someone to "go to Ghost Market with millions of yuan." Whether it's looking at goods or haggling over prices, the old woman on the corner with trachoma who is almost blind selling the only piece of torn clothing she has is just as serious about doing business. On Sundays, clever housewives run from afar to buy a face towel to reduce the middleman's profit from the small merchants who wholesale from here. On this day, many low-level female civil servants also squeeze in to buy boxes of face powder and soap, with sweat dripping down their faces and their cheongsams wrinkled and soiled... This is not just a "market," it is truly a microcosm of the "world." I remember someone describing how complete the goods in a department store in a big city are by saying: "Everything is available except rice and coffins." But in the area of "Ghost Market," both rice and coffins are available.

A calm observation of this corner of the market provides countless data and evidence of many serious economic problems currently facing us. First, we see the alarming rate at which foreign goods, mainly American goods, have been dumped on the market in recent months. Of course, we cannot measure this using the standards of Shanghai, but when a rustic old villager smilingly buys a "glass comb" as if he has found a treasure and puts it in his mended cloth bag, I cannot help but shudder. A Florida orange sells for over ten thousand yuan per catty (meaning two and a half catties of oranges can be exchanged for one "shi" of wheat or one bolt of native cloth). It still has a market in "Ghost Market." Is this "trade" or "crime"?

### Dr. Cheng Futing, the New Ambassador to the United Kingdom

Dr. Cheng Futing (Dr. F. T. Cheng), who served as an agent to the International Court of Justice at The Hague, is normally based in England, working as a lawyer. He has long enjoyed a prestigious reputation in both diplomatic and judicial circles overseas. Recently, a reporter traveled from France to England and paid him a special visit at the Chinese Embassy in the UK, located at 49 Portland Place, near Regent's Park. The embassy's decor exudes an antique charm. To use geography as a metaphor, it is like a world of tall trees. To use books as a metaphor, it is even more noble. Now, compared to the Chinese embassies in the UK, France, and the Netherlands, entering the UK embassy is like reading the magnificent history of the Han Dynasty, entering the French embassy is like viewing a masterpiece of Shakespeare, and entering the Dutch embassy is like reciting a collection of poems praising the virtues of Dutch philosophers.

If our compatriots still remember Dr. Sun Yat-sen's difficult affairs in London and then visit the British Embassy, then the great historical memories will be clearly as if they were just a month ago. Upon entering the landing area, one sees a statue of an ancient Buddha sitting facing one. Upstairs, there are large, beautiful flowers. Upon sitting down, there are deep blue dragon-patterned brocade couches and armchairs. Large vases are arranged along the window, and large bunches of bright red and white flowers are in full bloom, strikingly symbolizing the colors of the national emblem.

Ambassador Cheng's wife and children are still in Switzerland and have not yet come. Only his eldest son has come with him. He is served Western food every day, prepared by a chef left behind by the previous Ambassador Guo. The cooking is extremely exquisite.

The Ambassador's new book, written in English and titled "China Molded by Confucius," has just been published by Stevens, a London bookstore specializing in law books. The reporter sought it out at the bookstore at 16 Fleet Street and purchased a copy. The material is rich, and the intention is profound. It is truly an unprecedented treasure trove for promoting our ancient civilization abroad. Paper will be expensive in Luoyang. We await its success with anticipation.

This article is the first communication from Wang Wangren, recently traveling from the British capital. Mr. Wang has a well-known reputation in the journalistic world and is a strong advocate for overseas communications work. He served as an editor for this newspaper for many years. After graduating from the University of Washington in the United States, he traveled all over the world, working as a correspondent for this newspaper for decades as if it were a day. Later, due to the interruption of the war, he was missed by our compatriots for a long time. This time, he arrived in England from France and immediately sent us a new work, which is as welcome as a rare sound in an empty valley. We are extremely happy. Mr. Wang has also promised to send us a constant stream of articles in the future, which our readers will be happy to hear. We attach a few words to express our gratitude. (Editor)

### Jin Dynasty Bricks Discovered on Niutou Mountain in Qingjiang

—A Dispatch from Qingjiang on the 10th by Rao Huiyuan

Niutou Mountain, located in the Qin Hu Township of Qingjiang County, Jiangxi, is approximately twenty "hua li" from Zhangshu Town. The soil of the mountain was washed away by rainwater, revealing an ancient tomb. According to local villagers, it was discovered during the Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods of the late Qing Dynasty. When the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom army infiltrated the area, many people took refuge inside, mistaking it for an ancient kiln. In recent years, after county residents Xu Yuanjing and Rao Huiyuan visited and examined it, the bricks were found to be inscribed with the Ningkang era name, leading them to conclude that it was a tomb from the Jin Dynasty. The tomb is located in a remote mountain, its opening collapsed and exposed, overgrown with thorns. Upon crawling inside, the dome-shaped brick mine can be seen. The tomb is constructed with three layers of bricks, which are quite solid. It is approximately two "zhang" deep (as observed from the ground level). The height is obscured by accumulated soil. The bricks are 36.3 cm long, 3.43 cm thick (the other side has no patterns or text and is 6.6 cm thick), 18.5 cm wide, and weigh 7.5 kg. They are inscribed with eleven characters: "Gui Family Tomb, Fifth Day of the Ninth Month, Second Year of Ningkang," or cloud-shaped patterns (the end of the brick also has three characters: "Gui Family Tomb," or cloud-shaped patterns). Ningkang was the era name of Emperor Xiaowu of the Jin Dynasty, dating back over 1,500 years, so there is no doubt that it is an ancient tomb from the Jin Dynasty. However, who Gui was is unknown and cannot be verified because the county gazetteer does not record it (there is no one with the surname Gui within a hundred li of the area). However, judging by its structure, it does not seem to be an ordinary tomb. Furthermore, the handwriting is simple and vigorous, with the feel of clerical script and regular script, similar to the characters on Jin Dynasty steles. As for whether there are steles and funerary objects buried inside the tomb, we cannot know the details without excavation. There are many abandoned tombs near the tomb, and the bricks are exposed on the surface. Occasionally, one or two complete ones are found, with clear cloud-shaped double-coin patterns and linen cloth patterns, which seem to be burial objects from before the Tang and Song Dynasties (recently, a brick with the Chuping era name was discovered near the Jin Dynasty tomb, but the handwriting is not as clear as that on the Jin Dynasty bricks, and it seems to be a Han Dynasty brick from the Three Kingdoms period). Excavation is currently underway, and it is possible that archaeological artifacts may be collected. If so, it will not be difficult to provide material for experts to conduct archaeological research.

Rubbing of the Newly Discovered Jin Dynasty Brick

The Handwriting Is Simple and Vigorous, Almost Identical to Jin Dynasty Calligraphy

### Expanding Soviet Influence in the Middle East Encounters Setbacks

— Translated from the American World Journal, South

The Middle East is a arena where Britain, America, and the Soviet Union contend. Three months ago, the situation for Western countries was very unfavorable, but now the situation has changed, and the Soviet Union's plan to expand its influence in the Middle East has encountered major setbacks.

As for the goals of the contest between the two sides, one is to compete for oil resources, and the other is to ensure military security.

Everyone knows that beneath the mountains and deserts of the countries around the Persian Gulf lies one-third of the world's oil resources, which has attracted the attention of various countries.

According to the current situation, American oil companies control 42 percent of the total oil reserves in this area. They control all of Saudi Arabia's oil reserves, part of Iraq's oil reserves, and half of Kuwait's oil reserves.

British oil companies control 50 percent of the total oil reserves in this area. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, controlled by the British government, owns vast oil fields in southern Iran. In addition, Britain also has several oil fields in Iraq and Kuwait. As for the remaining part, it is in the hands of French and Dutch capitalists.

The Soviet Union has no oil fields in the Middle East, but it may obtain the oil rights in the vast oil fields in northern Iran.

The Importance of the Middle East Oil Fields Is Increasing Daily

Middle Eastern oil played a huge role in the United Nations' victory in World War II. As the production of old oil fields in other parts of the world decreases day by day, the importance of Middle Eastern oil fields is increasing.

The strategic importance of the Middle East is also very obvious. Because the British army will soon withdraw from Egypt, Britain must find new bases in the Middle East. The Suez Canal is the throat of the British Empire. The Persian Gulf, currently patrolled by the British Navy, is a passage to the Indian Ocean and a world trade route.

The Soviet Union and Iran have a very long common border, and it is only a day's journey from Iraq. The Soviet Union's interest in the Kurds, Azerbaijani democrats, Iranian politics, and Arab trends has allowed its influence to penetrate this region known for its oil production.

Due to factors such as oil resources and military security, the recent developments in the Middle East are becoming increasingly important. Now, let's briefly describe the setbacks that the Soviet Union has encountered in this area:

In Iran, the Soviet-backed left-wing party is gradually losing strength. Not long ago, the Tudeh Party was still arrogant and helped the Soviet Union obtain oil rights in northern Iran and autonomy for the Iranian province of Azerbaijan. The Tudeh Party was confident that it could win the upcoming elections and thus control the parliament. The trade unions controlled by the party even wanted to directly strike at Britain, calling for strikes in all British-owned oil fields.

But since then, the situation has changed. Arab mobs, under British instigation, crushed the strike movement and killed important trade union leaders. The local provincial government sent troops to imprison the remaining strike leaders. The Tehran government soon released the leaders of the Tudeh Party, but they were no longer able to operate in the oil company-controlled areas.

The most serious blow to the leftists was the success of the New Democratic Party formed by Prime Minister Sultanah. The party's platform sounded even more revolutionary than that of the Tudeh Party, but the original conservatives all rallied under the banner of the new party, aiming to weaken the Soviet-backed Tudeh Party. Therefore, the parliamentary elections have been delayed and delayed, and the longer the delay, the less chance the Tudeh Party has of success.

One thing is very important to the Soviet Union: the oil rights it obtained in northern Iran must be approved by the Iranian parliament on October 24, otherwise the previous agreement will become a piece of waste paper. There is currently no parliament in Iran. If the elections are not held quickly, it is unknown whether a parliament will be produced by October 24.

Whether the Middle East Can Be Stable Is Still Uncertain

After resolving the oil field strike, the British government soon issued a statement emphasizing the importance of Iran's oil resources and ordering the elite Indian 4th Division to be transferred from India to Basra in Iraq, only 30 miles from the Abadan oil field in Iran, which shows Britain's concern.

In Iraq, labor disputes often interrupt the production of the Mosul and Kirkuk oil fields. Under British guidance, the Iraqi government recently resolved a strike. There were some casualties before the strike was resolved, but the workers' demands for improved living conditions have been somewhat satisfied. In addition, the Iraqi government is arresting anti-government elements, which has anti-communist significance.

In Saudi Arabia, there are fewer labor disputes and the people are more primitive, but King Ibn Saud has issued an order banning communist activities to prevent problems before they occur. The most difficult problem in the country is the economic problem, but the US Export-Import Bank has lent it 10 million US dollars, which can promote Saudi Arabia's loyalty to the United States.

Egypt has also taken measures to suppress communist activities. Many suspects who distributed inciting propaganda have been imprisoned, and those who have not been imprisoned have received warnings to stop propaganda, otherwise they will have to leave Egypt.

Turkey recently elected a new cabinet, in which right-wing conservatives have a great advantage. The Foreign Minister, known for his opposition to Soviet demands, has remained in office.

The above situation shows that in the recent struggle between Britain and the Soviet Union in the Middle East, the Soviet Union's power has suffered setbacks, and Britain and the United States have temporarily prevented the Soviet Union's expansion in this area. However, whether the situation in the Middle East can be stable for a long time is still uncertain. Given the Soviet Union's long history of careful planning for the Middle East, it will counterattack as soon as it has the opportunity.

The rise and fall of the influence of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union in the Middle East is of great importance to world peace.

### Ten American Experts Review the Possibility of a Third World War

— Written by Diplomatic Reporter Famingzi, Translated by the Newspaper Editorial Office

"Will there be a third world war?" This is a question that people all over the world urgently want to get an answer to. United Press International correspondent and diplomatic affairs expert Franz had informal talks with ten experts in government and diplomatic circles whose daily work is closely related to relations with the Soviet Union. Now we will translate the conclusions he obtained after summarizing the opinions of all parties. According to his investigation, the possibility of a third world war is still very remote. The recent trend in the international arena is moving towards world equilibrium, replacing the European equilibrium of the 19th century, but powerful economic and social forces are playing their role, limiting international disputes to the diplomatic field without resorting to force.

The most important issue at present is none other than the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union. At the same time, this issue is also the most complex, and even the most capable diplomats dare not make hasty judgments, but they all believe that the current difficulties between the United States and the Soviet Union are due to the lack of understanding and understanding between Washington and Moscow in the post-war period.

The Paris Peace Conference is still in session. Many people think that arguing red-faced in the meeting place is enough to sharpen the opposition of opinions between countries, but people with diplomatic and economic experience feel that talking about the problems that have been bothering them in public is not without benefit to solving the problems. Another group of people believe that if countries can use notes to replace endless speeches when discussing disputed issues, it may be more effective, because this can make the work compact and avoid wasting a lot of unnecessary talk.

### Between the US and the Soviet Union

— South

A Gulf Is Drawn

Between the United States and the Soviet Union, a gulf seems to be drawn due to the different economic principles and systems of the two countries, but due to their urgent needs, there may be long-term mutual adaptation and even cooperation.

According to diplomats, Stalin occupies a strong position in today's world, because as a result of World War II, the Soviet Union has gained greatly in terms of territory and influence, but most of these gains are accomplished facts rather than legality. Therefore, the most favorable attitude towards the Soviet Union is to continuously conduct international negotiations step by step.

As for Britain, due to many difficult problems within the British Empire, it is in a secondary position in deciding the fate of the world. Many observers believe that the future of the world will be largely determined by the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union.

US Secretary of State Byrnes' speech in Stuttgart advocating German unification was unanimously praised by those who study international issues, because it guaranteed that the United States will continue to strive for the economic revival of Europe and world peace. From a good perspective, Byrnes' views may become a new agenda for the Four Foreign Ministers' meeting to discuss the German issue; from a bad perspective, Byrnes' proposal can at least promote economic cooperation between Western European countries.

As for the question of whether the situation in Europe will cause a new war, there are two answers: some people say bluntly "no," while others believe "at least not within five years." The first view is based on the saying that the United States will never launch a war unless attacked. The Soviet Union can enhance its position in the world without the danger of war. As for the second view, it is that the Soviet Union is currently technically incapable of fighting a war, but in the future, if it cannot achieve its goals through normal means, it may resort to war.

Current Affairs Commentary

### A World Startled Several Times in One Evening

— Chu Yukun

The Greek Civil War Is Expanding The Situation in the Straits Is Again in Turmoil

In recent weeks, politicians and diplomats from various countries have been making alarming statements, saying that a new war crisis is brewing or that the opposition between the two worlds is inevitable. These remarks have made our nerves extremely tense. However, Stalin published a statement to the reporter of the Sunday Times, expressing his disbelief that war would break out again, which is tantamount to giving the world a dose of cooling medicine, immediately sobering many people up. It has also suddenly clarified the political atmosphere between countries.

There Is Currently No War Crisis

Stalin met with a reporter from the British Sunday Times on September 24 and issued a written statement. He frankly stated: (1) He supports the withdrawal of US troops from China; (2) There is currently no war crisis; (3) Monopolizing the secrets of atomic energy is enough to endanger world peace; (4) He hopes to strengthen British-Soviet cultural relations.

This statement immediately aroused good reactions in the public opinion circles of various countries after it was published in the newspaper. Soviet personnel believed that if Stalin said there would be no war, there would be no war in the international arena, so they felt very gratified. This is also the case in Britain and the United States; Wallace believed that Stalin's statement would make millions of peace-loving people around the world feel infinite hope, and believed that Stalin had recognized that communism and capitalism can run parallel without contradicting each other. In Britain, it is even considered that Stalin's statement is the only factor that can stabilize people's hearts after the war. But in our opinion, Stalin's statement contains the subtle effect of being pro-British and anti-American.

The Soviet Union Raises the China Issue

The Soviet Union failed repeatedly at the Paris Peace Conference and was very frustrated that it could not control the conference, so it wanted to use the issue to make a fuss; first, it used the border conflict between Greece and Albania to launch a major attack on the British troops stationed in Greece; but when it came to the Security Council, the Soviet representative Gromyko could not succeed alone, and failed to exert the diplomatic offensive it had adopted; so it changed its direction and used the China issue to launch an offensive against the United States. The main points of his proposal are: (1) The presence of US troops in China has created a situation that is enough to cause international friction; (2) US troops are currently interfering in the internal affairs of China, Iceland, and Latin American countries; (3) The situation in China is not only related to China and the United States, and the Security Council should pay attention to it.

China is also a permanent member of the Security Council. Only China can solve the China issue. Even if it is necessary to appeal to the Security Council, the Chinese representative can also raise it himself, so why bother Gromyko to overstep his authority? What position will he put China in by raising it like this? Therefore, the Chinese diplomatic authorities immediately stated that the presence of US troops in China was based on China's request and does not endanger peace. US Acting Secretary of State Clayton also made the same statement: the presence of US troops in China has not caused unrest. Therefore, the Soviet Union's proposal was also rejected by the Security Council.

The Greek King Returns to the Country and the Civil War Breaks Out Again

Since the plebiscite in Greece decided to allow the king to return to the country and restore the monarchy, the conflict between the government and the leftists has become uncontrollable. Recently, the Greek civil war has reached a critical juncture; Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris told the press on the 25th: "The war has been transferred from foreign countries to Greece, and foreign forces want to use the chaotic situation to achieve the purpose of obtaining an outlet to the Aegean Sea." From this, we can know the seriousness of the Greek civil war. Britain also believes that the situation in Greece is unstable and does not want to withdraw its troops back to the country, and has jointly decided with the United States to adopt a firm stance, seemingly not hesitating to be involved in the whirlpool of the Greek civil war, which may make Greece become the second Spain.

But when the situation in Greece was in crisis, King George II suddenly returned to the country to restore the monarchy. The current cabinet has resigned, and the former prime minister will form a new cabinet, which will soon be completed.

The Peace Conference Decides to Step Up Its Work

The Paris Peace Conference is scheduled to end before October 15, and all committees must step up their work. The foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union decided on the following ways to speed up the work of the conference: (1) The conference is scheduled to hold a plenary session on October 5 to make decisions on the various issues that have been pending for a long time. Each committee should also report the progress of its work to the conference separately. (2) The conference will hold a plenary session on October 15 at the latest to submit various peace treaties for a vote. (3) The four foreign ministers will meet on October 5 to study the results obtained by the conference: they must complete the various tasks before October 15. (4) By the time the United Nations General Assembly opens, if the work of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference has not yet been completed, the four foreign ministers should go to New York to continue working during the first few days of the United Nations General Assembly.

Since then, all committees have stepped up their work, but haste makes waste, and the Trieste issue has never been resolved. On the 28th, the Committee on Italy passed the border between Italy and Yugoslavia, and the Yugoslav representative threatened to refuse to sign the peace treaty, and the Soviet Union also supported it, so it is expected that the conference will be difficult to complete its work as scheduled.

The Situation in the Straits Is Becoming Tense Again

The issue of the Turkish Straits once caused a great uproar in the international community, and then gradually subsided; but on September 28, the Soviet Union issued a second note to the Turkish government, requesting that the Soviet Union and Turkey jointly defend the Straits area. Turkey's attitude is still firm as a pipe, and it will never change due to Soviet threats. In order to deal with any eventuality, it is also mobilizing troops there. Therefore, the situation in the Straits has changed, and it has once again become the focus of attention for the world.

### The New Defense Lines of the United States and the Soviet Union Are in the Remote and Cold Arctic Circle

— United Press International Correspondent Cole New York Special Dispatch Translated by the Newspaper Editorial Office South

The remote and cold Arctic Circle has now become an important defense town for the United States and the Soviet Union. With the emergence of new weapons, long-range bombers departing from bases in the Arctic region can threaten all strategic points in Europe, Asia, and America, which would have been unimaginable to people in the 19th century. Currently, the United States and the Soviet Union are closely watching each other's actions in the Arctic Circle, especially the movements in Alaska and eastern Siberia.

Alaska and the far east of Siberia are only separated by the Bering Strait, and the Kamchatka Peninsula and the Aleutian Islands almost connect the eastern and western hemispheres. Currently, these places are becoming outposts for US and Soviet defense, and huge military installations are being built there.

The Soviet Union Is Actively Building Airports, Highways, and Ports

According to reports from various parties, the following points have been done by the Soviet Union in this area: (1) A large airport has been built in Petropavlovsk, which can accommodate bombers as large as Flying Fortresses. The area is only 490 miles away from Atu Island, the US's foremost outpost; (2) Behind the airport and in the hinterland of the area around the port of Petropavlovsk, acres of land have been cleared and warehouses and barracks have been built; (3) The entrance to Avancha Bay has been dredged to allow large ships to enter; (4) The highway on the west coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula from Bolsheretsk to Petropavlovsk has been improved to make it a military road that can be used in all kinds of weather. In addition, there is also an auxiliary road at the southern end of the peninsula, from Bolsheretsk to Cape Lopatka.

The United States obtained this information, of course, it will not say how it obtained it. But in terms of collecting intelligence, the Soviet Union is not necessarily inactive. Over the island of Attu, Soviet planes can be detected flying four or five days a week. The unofficial statement from the Soviet Union is that it is to observe the weather. This statement sounds very reasonable, because there is almost year-round fog over Attu Island, so it is not easy to see the situation on the ground from the air.

But now there is radar, and the installations on the ground can be measured by radar. For example, Americans rarely see Soviet planes, but they know that planes are indeed flying based on radar signals. The Soviet Union's flight over Attu Island is a one-sided action, because the Soviet Union does not allow American or any other country's planes to fly within 200 miles of Soviet territory.

The Soviet Union has announced that it is conducting experiments in Siberia, which, like most of Alaska, is covered by frost and snow all year round, which is very deep. The Soviet Union is using snow plows to clear the frost and snow. If their experiment is successful, then large areas of wasteland in Siberia can be used for military and commercial purposes.

If this can be done in Siberia, then it can also be done in Alaska. The Arctic Circle Has Become a Major Strategic Town Today

US and Soviet Activities Focus on Both Military and Economic Aspects

The Soviet Union concentrated its efforts on developing Siberia shortly before Japan surrendered. Petropavlovsk has a population of 90,000 and has not been affected by the war. After the United States joined the war against Japan, Washington urged Moscow to make Petropavlovsk the second port in the Far East to prevent Japan from attacking Vladivostok, but the Soviet Union did not express interest at the time. But shortly before Japan surrendered, the Soviet Union made efforts to turn Petropavlovsk into a base, and so far, it can be said that it has achieved great success. Ships come and go, and transportation is frequent. This ice-free port is one of the best ports in the far north.

Washington officials pointed out that these activities of the Soviet Union cannot be viewed solely from a military point of view. War is not just child's play, but to make the country and its people live and prosper. The Soviet Union has repeatedly told the world that it wants to become a major commercial country, and the plans they are carrying out in Siberia also have the purpose of developing this vast and rich land.

The US military admits that the Soviet Union has the right to carry out defense work on its own territory. The actions of the Soviet Union in Siberia are for the same purpose as the actions of the United States in Alaska.

Therefore, the activities of the United States and the Soviet Union in the Arctic region obviously have both military and economic significance.

International Figures

### Stalin Has No Generalship; He Says: "I Am Not Mysterious"

— Translated from Magazine Digest by Zuo Qi

In the recent international disputes, almost every one of them is related to the Soviet Union. To understand the Soviet Union, we must first understand the person behind the scenes of the Soviet government—Stalin.

In the Soviet Union, which practices Marxist ideals, the strangest contradiction is: Marx believed that history is not created by individual heroes, but entirely by the power of the masses; however, no country worships heroic idols more than the Soviet Union, and no country's citizens regard their leader as so sacred and wielding power as great as Stalin.

Indeed, Stalin controls all the party, government, and military power in the Soviet Union. He possesses the world's most powerful private army. Therefore, like the emperors of ancient times, it is very difficult to see him easily. Even when he invites foreign guests, he often looks down and does not look at the faces of the guests, so the guests naturally find it difficult to see his face clearly. In the years of the war against Germany, he never left the country except for one trip to Tehran. Moreover, he does not often make speeches. Former US President Roosevelt made about two speeches a week, but Stalin made at most two a year.

The brief history of Stalin's rule of the Soviet Union is as follows: In the past, he spent thirty-five years fighting the ruling class and was exiled five times by the Tsar. He spent his entire youth planning revolutionary work. Sure enough, after the October Revolution, the Tsar was overthrown. However, the system of prohibiting freedom of speech and freedom of assembly that existed before the Tsar still exists today. Is this the practice of democracy in the Soviet Union under Stalin's leadership? Also, when Trotsky was exiled by the revolutionary army in 1929, Stalin officially became a first-class figure in the party and the state. Therefore, in order to implement his personal ideas, he used his power to kill many comrades who had lived and died with him in the past, until 1940, when Stalin ended his struggle. In this year, Trotsky was assassinated.

It is said that Stalin has two major desires: to avenge personal grudges and to expand the Soviet Union. The first goal has been achieved, and the second goal has also been successfully achieved in this victory in the war against the Axis powers.

Stalin clearly understands and is familiar with the character of the Germans—weakness and obedience. He once proudly told others:

"During the revolutionary period, I and several German comrades went to the 　Laukenburg station to take a train to a certain place for a secret meeting. However, we were too late. Fortunately, the ticket collector did not notice, and I slipped past the platform. However, several German comrades did not dare to do this. Finally, taking advantage of the chaos, they were pulled over by me. Fortunately, we caught up with the train."

Now, Stalin wants to get rewards on the personality of the Germans. The Germans are not difficult to be fascinated and influenced by Soviet education. Like Prussia, Saxony, Thuringia, part of Mecklenburg—almost half of Germany—are under Soviet control. The fruits of victory are not only these. More than half a dozen small European countries have implemented communism without any revolution. He watched his decades of efforts, and today he has finally reaped the harvest.

Former US War Production Board Director Nelson once visited Stalin. From this, we can see Stalin's attitude towards the United States. At that time, Nelson asked what the Soviet Union needed after the war. Stalin immediately wrote on a piece of paper: 50,000 motor vehicles. It can be seen that the Soviet Union only regards the United States as a source of machinery.

Stalin can be said to have completely realized the ambition that was not fulfilled during the Tsarist era. Once, a reporter said that Stalin was as successful as Peter the Great. He laughed after hearing this. In fact, there is a big difference between them: Peter longed to learn everything from the Europeans; Stalin hoped to educate the Europeans.

Also, once, when a reporter talked about fate, Stalin said: "No, I don't believe in fate. Only the ancient Greeks would believe that our lives are given by God. I am not a mysterious person. If you are curious why I didn't die in the revolution, I can answer you, anyone can sit in this chair and be like me." However, for decades, he has been trying to prevent anyone from seizing this throne.

"I am Lenin's student," he said himself. However, everyone feels that this is just a self-promotion. Look at what a Soviet writer said: "When he dies, we must build a tomb that is even greater than Lenin's."

Spring and Autumn

### Ode to Childlessness

— Zhang Mingchun

I am approaching forty and still have no children. Some friends feel sorry for me; some bless me. After careful analysis, I feel that people without children are lucky. Please let me explain in detail.

Originally, nature created a huge framework, enticing everyone to enter it. First, it calls you to enjoy the right to marry, and then it calls you to fulfill the obligation to have children. Isn't it a blessing to enjoy the right to marry without the suffering of having children? Many people do not consider their ability to support children. In this era, they end up with a large number of children. When they realize that this burden is too heavy to bear, they try to have abortions and study ineffective methods of birth control, lowering their standard of living. It is already too late. With children, your wife will definitely be distracted and unable to serve you wholeheartedly. That's not all. If you are clean, your gowns will often be soiled; if you like quiet, there will be a crying baby in bed; you don't have to worry about no one practicing calligraphy on your beloved books; your favorite flowers and plants are often uprooted; the children's ill health is even more painful than your own illness; the death of a child will also have the danger of Zixia losing his sight. If you want to live a dissolute life, they are your invisible monitors. In families with children, parents have no freedom of speech.

If you don't have children and he doesn't have children, won't this nation become the second American Indians, facing the danger of being eliminated? There is no need to worry about this. There are those who are lost and refuse to return who will be responsible for it, believing that "there are three unfilial acts, and having no descendants is the greatest."

The promoters of encouraging childbirth are almost all power-hungry ambition-mongers. The fascists of Japan, Germany, and Italy deprived the people of all rights and freedoms. Why do they only like you to have sons? Why did Hitler force others to have children, but he himself only married at the time of his death? Today, if there are still some heroes who encourage widows to have children, virgins to have children, and force nuns to marry, don't you understand their intentions?

Without sons, won't people laugh at you for being immoral? Don't worry, don't worry. Chen Tuan's "Heart Physiognomy" clearly states: "Fairness and integrity, even without offspring, will become gods after death." Therefore, people without sons can still become Bodhisattvas. The number of people killed and injured in World War II was nearly 100 million. If arranged in a single line, they could circle the earth four times. Who are they not someone else's good sons? Therefore, according to modern views, it should be: "Those who accumulate virtue have no sons."

Looking closely at the great figures of ancient and modern times, few have many children. How many sons did Sakyamuni, Jesus, Moses, and Muhammad have? Confucius only had a single son who died young. I can't say who Mencius's son was. Guan Yu and Yue Fei both had no direct sons. As for Chinese and foreign heroes, martyrs, scholars, and recluses, such as Wen Tianxiang, Shi Kefa, Gu Yanwu, Zheng Suonan, Lin Hejing, Kant, Descartes... (I won't list more modern celebrities) Where are their sons?

If people really want to laugh at you for having no descendants, you can resist with one sentence: "A bad melon has many seeds." The world's first-class plants and animals are very difficult to preserve their seeds. For example, phoenixes are rare, but sparrows are the most; unicorns are rare, but rats are the most; lingzhi is rare, but weeds are the most; by analogy, sweet springs are rare, but seawater is the most; gold and jade are rare, but mud is the most... Childless people can take this as self-comfort.

"Raising children to prevent old age" is even more of a dream. He can't even be filial to his own wife, will he support you?

"Making a name to honor your parents," don't you want to make a name for yourself through your son? This is even more absurd. I only see sons making a name for themselves, because we only know the sons of celebrities, and we don't know much about their fathers.

However, I also admire the words of someone I don't know: "Sons are like eyebrows. They are of little use if you have them, but they attract attention if you don't have them." That's all.

### Autumn

— Lao Dan

Time flies like a shuttle. Summer has drifted away like light smoke. Time does not stop. How ruthless it is! No wonder human life is also so fleeting.

The long summer has passed. Now it is again the season of the west wind and withered chrysanthemums. Morning and evening bring a bit of chill. The light clouds in the sky and the fallen leaves in front of the steps fully report that autumn has arrived. The golden wind is refreshing, and the osmanthus is fragrant. How can one not believe that it is late autumn?

Autumn heart is sorrow. When the autumn wind blows bleakly across your face, it gives you a hint as if telling you to regret the easily passing time. Once time passes, it is permanently irreversible. Often a few yellow leaves fall from the tree, sometimes even hitting your body, which may make you feel that your own life is also like them, withering and fleeting. In the evening, the suburbs, lawns, roadsides, intermittently emit a few faint insect chirps. Listening to them, how can you not recall the croaking of frogs in the countryside and fields. In short, all the phenomena of autumn give people endless disappointment and memories, especially what is most easily touched is the melancholy of wanderers who are far away from their hometowns, thinking of their relatives and friends.

Autumn, I am really a little afraid. I am afraid that she will bring a lot of sorrow to people, causing them to constantly yearn for the past, and at the same time be at a loss for the vague future. Although recollection may be of considerable significance, and the future may be bright, in the course of life, it is like bubbles and ephemerals. Then, the changes in human affairs, all the transformations, who can guarantee them?

Some people say that the joy and sorrow of life all stem from each person's own mind. Therefore, everything is determined by the mind. This sentence is very roundabout. But why do most people insist on making trouble for themselves and cannot create a happy and fulfilling life as they wish? I think he will answer you like this: "Easier said than done"?

"The autumn wind whispers, the cold cicada clings to the tree without a sound; the night moon is desolate, the sorrowful geese are startled by the frost and speak alone. The world has no public opinion, who knows the gender of birds? People have a sense of caution, and no one knows the morning or evening of life"! Under the confluence of thousands of emotions, I can't help but recall a few parallel prose sentences from a certain gentleman, and the more I savor them, the more I feel that they are timely words with deep meaning. Taking advantage of this slight breeze and the not-too-cold weather, I write a few sentences to express my feelings a little, perhaps because I have been influenced by the autumn atmosphere.

### On Children's Literature Works

— Lu Shaoqing

Creating children's literature is a thankless task. However, the creation of children's literature has an important position in the educational cultivation of the younger generation. Gorky wrote "Russian Fairy Tales," and Mr. Lu Xun translated many children's literature works, such as "　" and "Pink　". These world-renowned writers all attached great importance to children's literature. Especially Mr. Lu Xun, seeing the Chinese children's reading materials that were still in the era of poisonous serial picture books, could not help but shout loudly: "Save the children!" This sentence has become a warning to writers in the country. However, more than ten years later, has there been much progress in Chinese children's reading materials? How many excellent children's literature works have been produced? The answer to this question is still chilling.

But the only thing that can comfort us is that there are still some writers who are unwilling to sit idly by and watch China's innocent young people delve into the serial picture books of immortals and swordsmen. They have picked up their pens and are trying to create new types of children's literature.

So we read Zhang Tianyi's fairy tales, He Yi's fairy tales, and Fan Quan's fairy tales.

Regarding Mr. Fan Quan's fairy tales, I have only read two single-printed books and two short stories. The single-printed books are the created "Haba Kingdom" and the translated "Black and White Record." The short stories are "Happiness" and "The Stone Mill That Likes to Sing," which are continuously published in the semi-monthly magazine "Juvenile World."

"Black and White Record" is a translated full-length fairy tale, originally written by the Korean writer Zhang Hezhou, and based on Chinese and Mongolian legends. The content of the whole book writes about two distinctly different personalities: Black Treasure and White Treasure, two brothers. I don't understand Japanese, so I can't compare the translation with the original. However, judging from the translator's writing style, we can't tell that this is a translation. The translator is very good at understanding the psychology of children, and the organization of the sentences matches the children's reading ability and reading interest. In addition, with Mr. Chen Yanqiao's clear and powerful illustrations, this is a children's literature work that has been difficult to see in recent years.

But what surprised me even more was his creative fairy tale "Haba Kingdom." "Haba Kingdom" is a realistic work. From the beginning to the end of the work, the author tightly grasps the psychology of children and completely uses the tone of children to set off the entire story. The story uses the big nose of the King of Haba Kingdom as the key to the story and the engine for developing the story. The carved characters are also very prominent, giving readers a deep impression. The author uses a humorous style and very ridiculous statements to describe very serious events and very realistic stories. The narration of the whole book can be said to be coherent and extremely tense, capturing the scene of the struggle everywhere, making people feel more and more interested and wanting to read the whole book quickly. Therefore, whether in terms of theme or expression, this work is successful.

Mr. Fan Quan's children's literature creation can be summarized into several characteristics.

First, the reality of the subject matter. This can be seen from the two creative fairy tales "Haba Kingdom" and "Happiness." The author does not want children to roam "wonderland" like Amos. The author does not want children to be isolated from reality. On the contrary, he wants to bring "reality" to children, so that children also know the good and evil, the truth and falsehood, the lovable and the hateful of this world.

Second, grasp the psychology of children. This is the basic condition for the creation of children's literature. Whether a work belongs to children or adults is distinguished here. And to bring "reality" to children, if it is only written in the tone of adults, children will not accept it. Mr. Fan Quan is very considerate of this point in his expression techniques, which is where he succeeds.

Third, rich in educational meaning. Originally, the creation of children's literature is to instill new knowledge in children and inspire new ideas in children. "Haba Kingdom" and "Happiness" both contain rich realistic knowledge, but this knowledge is not dogma, but a literary form purely expressed using an inspirational educational method, which is also worthy of our praise.

But here, I must also point out two potentially dangerous tendencies: First, humor that tends towards meaningless farce. This is a road that must never be taken. Zhang Tianyi's works also almost have this terrible trend. Second, the structure of the sentences is too far-fetched and clever, because children are full of imitation. If they imitate such sentences in their writing class, wouldn't it be a big joke?

But in the present era when children's literature works are as rare as the stars at dawn, and when serial picture books of immortals and swordsmen flood the streets, I want to recommend Mr. Fan Quan's children's literature works to adults and children who are currently concerned about children's literature!

### Continued Notes on the Exhibition of Calligraphy and Painting of Past Dynasties

— Dingshan

The painting exhibition started on the 29th, and all the exhibits were replaced. Cong Yu's "Chu Suiliang Post" was not exhibited, but Wang Shimin and Wang Yuanqi's two scrolls, Wu Li's "Looking at Pines After Rain," and Shi Tao's "Lotus Flowers" were all not listed in the catalog. Wu Li's scroll, the color of the paper is so new, it is like a treasure that has been treasured for three hundred years and has never been displayed. It is a real masterpiece! Shi Tao's "Lotus Flowers" has such strange coloring and composition that no one but Shi Tao can do it.

Pang Yuanji's "Summer Mountain Residence" by Wang Meng is again the top sight of the whole field. This old man's collection is unmatched outside the Forbidden City. With these two works being the crown of the entire exhibition, I have no doubts.

Sun Bozhu's Wang Shimin and Wang Jian calligraphy are also masterpieces, and they are also not listed in the catalog. Wang Shimin's early work is very similar to Dong Qichang, but it has a kind of majestic air that Dong Qichang does not have.

Xu Bangda's Sima Guang scroll has a title by Yang Weizhen, which can be paired with the previously exhibited Lianzhou scroll. I have seen many Sima Guang scrolls, and Xu's scroll and Wu Zishen's scroll are the best. The exhibits that Wu Zishen promised this time have not arrived; is Wu Zishen lazy and enjoying himself alone?

Zhao Mengfu's axis by Wu Hufan and Ma Yuan's axis by Tan Heling have not arrived. What I said in my previous record about being able to imitate is just a matter of course. A smile!

I once wanted to list Dong Qichang, Xiang Shengmo, Wang Shimin, and Yuan Zhao as the four masters of the late Ming Dynasty, and separately list Wang Yuanqi, Wang Hui, Wu Li, and Yun Shouping as the four masters of the Qing Dynasty; some people think it is not satisfactory. Now, after seeing Xiang Shengmo's "Calamus" painting exhibited by Yang Weizhen, it is truly divine. How can Dong and Wang compare?

Qian Jingtang's "Ma Xianglan's Letters to Wang Bogu" contains more than ten letters, with feelings that are so entangled that one wants to die, and the calligraphy is so delicate that it penetrates the bone. It is the most beautiful thing in the whole field.

### Lonely Window

— Su Shan

The window brings to my small room such secluded brilliance. A delicate pattern composes my many years of boudoir dreams.

I didn't know what loneliness was before, but since someone left a shadow in my heart, I have had loneliness and too deep a sense of desolation.

Slender bamboos decorate the window sill, decorate my lonely heart, and even more decorate my midsummer night's dream.

From late autumn to severe winter, severe winter brings dawn again. My lonely window always reflects the south-bound swallows, south-bound and returning north, and maple leaves dye the window edge, but they are washed by the winter snow and frost again and again. The bright moon in August immerses the window and people in the Milky Way, soaking my lonely heart. Occasionally, a small bird passes by, but it flutters away in a hurry, unable to take away the loneliness.

"The green lamp illuminates the wall, and the person is just falling asleep; the cold rain knocks on the window, and the quilt is not warm." Lonely people, after all, are just "Summer day is clear and does not end late, winter lamp is frozen and the night is long!" From then on, I experience the hesitation of leaving dreams and the flying of farewell intentions. A shadow is imprinted in the bottom of my heart, but it is always just loneliness. Loneliness·Loneliness.

### Get More Familiar with Forms

— Lü Su

Lu Xun's profound and pungent satire and criticism of society completely relied on the form of his essays to develop and complete. Mayakovsky's futurist poetry form expressed his unrestrained and agitated emotions. Alexandre Dumas fils wrote "La Dame aux Camélias," first as a novel and then as a play. These two different forms of narrating the details of the story in sequence gave it depth. "The True Story of Ah Q" narrates Ah Q's spiritual victory by means of the author's wonderful psychological depiction method, but the play adapted by Tian Han and Xu Xingzhi, etc., needs to borrow other characters on the stage to describe him, which is inevitably a failure. This proves the inseparability of form and content.

The relationship between form and content is so great that writers must use multiple forms to express content. It is certainly good for a writer to be particularly good at and familiar with a certain form, but if they can be familiar with multiple forms, there will be many good subjects that will not slip through the writer's hands, nor will the content be greatly diminished due to the hard stuffing of the form.

### An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 50

— Ye Jingfeng

Arriving at Mr. W's headquarters in the ×× Hotel, I saw that Dingyuan was somewhat fatigued, so I advised him to stay in the car and that I could thank Mr. W on his behalf. Yuan agreed. As soon as I stepped into Mr. W's room, Mr. W was holding the secret telephone receiver. When he saw me enter, he immediately put down the phone, his expression already changed, but his demeanor remained calm.

"I'm sorry!" he said very cautiously. "I just called to invite you over, originally to tell you some bad news—Miss Ji Yaoqun and Hucheng, the Tongzhou affair was going smoothly, but this morning around six o'clock, we suddenly received a secret report from there saying that the two of them had suddenly disappeared. First Hucheng, then Yaoqun also disappeared... I have already sent several capable comrades there, specifically for this matter..."

"I understand!" My heart started to panic, and I didn't want to hear anything else. I was about to tell him that after I sent Dingyuan back to Changxindian, I would rush to Tongzhou overnight.

Mr. W waved his hand, "There's more!" He seemed a little breathless, "Just after I called you, your department in Changxindian suddenly called..."

"What happened?" I felt another shock, a little scared, and my heart started pounding uncontrollably.

"I forwarded it, asking you to rush back quickly..." Mr. W said, "I asked him what important matter it was. On the phone, he only said, 'It's no good, the brothers seem to be fully mobilized, the power plant is on fire, there's a big change...' He said he was a communications officer, and the person in charge had already gone out to command. When I asked again, the phone had already been cut off... I've been calling here, calling until now..." Mr. W explained the terrible news in one breath.

Before he finished speaking, I jumped over, and as I reached out, he knew I wanted to try his secret phone, so he picked up the receiver he had just used and handed it to me. While I was calling, I gestured for him to try the secret telegraph. Their equipment was a bit old, with the phone and cipher separated into two parts, which could be transmitted simultaneously. We called at the same time, calling for a long time, but there was no response from the station. Knowing there was no hope, I put down the receiver and prepared to leave.

"Wait!" Mr. W also stopped sending the telegram, "There are two more things. Just now, we received battlefield intelligence. The news is very bad. Zhao Dengyu, the commander of the 132nd Division in Nanyuan, has been killed in action. Tong Linge, the deputy commander of the 29th Army on the outer perimeter, has been seriously wounded. Judging by the tone of the intelligence, it seems his life is in danger. We don't have exact information yet. In Wanping, the Japanese devils have reinforced their counterattack, and our side is also at a disadvantage... I have already sent several comrades and a driver with four submachine guns, divided into three cars, to go with you... Perhaps!"

I just raised my hand and said, "Okay, thank you!" and hurried away.

I got in the car, and our four cars started together. At this time, the two guards in my car had been replaced by two others, probably Mr. W's men. There was also a submachine gun and a small box of ammunition in the car. The driver was also not the original attendant. All of this was probably arranged by Mr. W, and I felt both grateful and admired. In the car, I didn't dare to say anything to Dingyuan, just mumbled a few words. Anyway, he was very tired, huddled in the corner of the car, seeming to be falling asleep. This was a reaction to his over-excitement.

The driver seemed to have received orders, knowing that the destination of this trip was Changxindian, so he went straight west out of the West Gate, without needing me to direct him. Not far outside the city, he waved his hand, telling the cars behind us to come forward. Our car fell behind, inserted into the third position, so that our position was more thoroughly protected. It was just after four o'clock, and the sounds of gunfire and cannons from the battlefield in the suburbs were very clear. When the car was about to reach Tiancun, we suddenly heard the roar of heavy machine guns in a forest in front of us. The car leading the way immediately swerved towards the side of the road, towards several large trees. Our car, of course, followed closely. Arriving under the largest tree, all four cars found suitable spots and stopped one after another. We saw two comrades from the first car, along with the driver, all jump out. A young man, acting like a captain, shouted loudly, "Everyone get out of the car! Find cover!" He ran in front of us and gave us a military salute, "Please get out of the car, gentlemen; Japanese planes are coming!"

### New World Symphony

— Zhu Lixing

In commemoration of the great Bohemian composer Antonin Dvorak (1841-1904), concerning his Symphony No. 5 in E minor.

On the morning of October 17, 1920, amidst heavy fog, the London Sir Hamilton Harty & Halle Symphony Orchestra performed for the first time this carefully constructed "New World" Symphony No. 5 in E minor (Humoresque Symphonie en mi Mineur, Opus—95) by one of the greatest composers of the Slavic people at the Scala Theatre, not far from Westminster Abbey. Because it was a rehearsal, there were few people in the audience. However, after seventy-five minutes of slow performance, the few people in the audience were unexpectedly packed, and even the wide aisles were crowded with people. The Scala Theatre was simply packed tightly. These guests were unexpected visitors, but everyone was well-behaved and listened quietly. After the performance, everyone walked out of the theater with applause, smiling at each other, and everyone was happy.

Because this time Dvorak's symphony was introduced to Western Europe, countries in Central Europe such as Switzerland began to gradually pay attention to Slavic composers, study them, and become interested in them. For example, the works of the great Russian composer Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky (1840-1893) were previously not well understood by Western Europe, or even Central Europe. Dvorak was originally from Bohemia, so his works inevitably caused a sense of distance. In fact, a nation has its own characteristics, but the works of the Germanic peoples are relatively easy for people to accept. If it were not for the brilliant structure of Dvorak's "New World" Symphony, perhaps the artistic position of Slavic composers would still be separate and divergent.

Tchaikovsky was one year older than Dvorak, and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov (1844-1908) was three years younger than Dvorak. The contributions of these three great composers who represent the Slavic people in the arts have added a lot of collaborative spirit among various nations in the arts. Because of this, music has never experienced division to this day. It is completely unified for a hundred years. In the ethnic characteristics, compared with Tchaikovsky's works, the most obvious and authentic Eastern European style is harsh to the ear, while Rimsky-Korsakov is far less stubborn and conservative. However, on the other hand, Tchaikovsky also succeeded because he made his nationality authentic. Between the two, Dvorak is the most moderate genius. This "New World" Symphony, from depicting "Dawn" (Aurore), followed by the "Nostalgia" A ogio to the final "Rapid Fantasy" section, fully developed in the 19th century the natural development of art in the three regions of East, Central and Western Europe as the structure of metallurgy and iron casting. In addition to complete success, it must be said to be the fate between the two great nations. No wonder people with music theory knowledge inevitably have all sorts of reveries when they listen to this "New World".

In Richard Strauss's notes, it was recorded that Dvorak's "New World" Symphony evolved from his own work: "E" Major Quartet (Quinttelo en mi Majer Opus-22), but the level of this quartet is far higher than "New World", which inevitably leads to some speculation. The reason is that this "New World" Symphony is certainly successful in terms of technology, but in terms of level, it is far inferior to his own—Dvorak—quartet. Later generations unanimously recognized that since Franz Schubert, he is the first person to devote his efforts to constructing profound quartets. After the four great composers Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, and Schubert, he is the best. He would never have evolved the naming of the "New World" from studying the insights left by the great Germanic composers, and he would not have created this "New World" after making the "New World" so profound that it was difficult for people to understand. Strauss really overestimated it - the "New World" Symphony.

The English name of the "New World" Symphony is: Symphony No. 5 "New World" in E Minor. Opus 95. It is listed as the ninety-fifth piece in Dvorak's life's work.

### Mumbled Words by the Dim Lamp

— Shaofu

Daylight saving time has ended, and the original time has been restored. The clocks have been turned back one hour. Therefore, we spent two twelves o'clock last night. Because of the one-hour backward movement, we are confused about the time, making us dizzy!

There are appointments with two friends. They all use the old time, and I use the new time, which makes everyone complain. Things like this are bound to happen a lot in the next two days.

It is said that the Public Utilities Bureau has banned the use of neon lights outdoors since yesterday.

In fact, everything is the same. The red is still red, the green is still green, and the eye-catching is still blinking. I know that I'm afraid I'll have to waste a lot of words on this!

From a aesthetic point of view, if the city loses its neon lights, it will not be a city.

They are shouting about suppressing commodity prices again. Shanghai people seem to be numb and are not interested in this. Anyway, prices are always rising, so let them rise! As for talking about suppressing, let you suppress it! Suppression will not level things out, at most it will not rise much.

What is the reason for the formation of this mentality, it is too sad to think about!

A single passenger encountered a robbery in the suburban villa. A robbery in broad daylight happened on the Beijing-Shanghai line, and the problem is not simple. Some people say this is "he who enters through dishonesty, departs through dishonesty," and others say, "the poorer you are, the more unlucky you become."

Comic strips, which have penetrated into the masses, are a powerful tool for imparting knowledge; the tool itself does not need to bear the merits and demerits of society, the problem is only in its content, how to guide it into the right track, so as not to become a poison to the minds of women and children.

Theory is not the focus of this article, I only provide some facts about comic books:

Appeared as early as the late Qing Dynasty

Comic strips appeared as early as the late Qing Dynasty. At first, they were printed using woodblocks, the printing was poor, and the content was mostly absurd and bizarre, focusing on low-level tastes, and not suitable for polite society. By the early years of the Republic of China, lead printing was used, and the editing and drawing techniques gradually improved, but the collection of materials still did not depart from gods, monsters, and pornography. When there were sensational social cases, no matter how unethical or immoral, they were mostly recorded as content, and they were embellished to numb the nerves of the general public with shallow knowledge and little knowledge.

It was not until around the 20th year of the Republic of China that movie scripts began to be used as subjects, from "Breaking the Golden Light Formation", "Burning the Red Lotus Temple", "Lion Head Strange Hero" ... and other divine and strange romances, to "Fisherman's Light Song", "The Lost Lamb", "Little Angel", "慈母曲" ... and other social ethics stories.

The continuous change in the content of comic strips is a reflection of social trends and the trend of the times. Publishers must cater to the psychology of readers in order to do business. "Sharp eyes and sensitive minds" are necessary conditions. Since the War of Resistance Against Japan, more than a hundred kinds of comic strips about military affairs, science, education, and resistance to the enemy have appeared. Although it cannot be said to be meritorious, perhaps it can "atone for sins" and slightly offset the faults of the past.

Eating from Comic Strips

There are about ten "comic strip" bookstores in Shanghai, with "Yadong", "Global", "Rixin", "Wende", "Qizhi", and "Youwen" publishing the most books. These publishers either sell the copyright to the editors and artists, or pay monthly salaries. If the sales are brisk after the book is published, there will be extra bonuses. The treatment is not bad, so there are those who take this as a lifelong career.

The sales of comic books have always been mainly in inland counties, cities and towns. In addition, they are wholesale to book stalls and vendors in the city at a 40% discount. According to the statistics of the 26th, there are more than 4,000 "comic strip rental stalls" in the city, from bustling streets to remote alleys, there are traces of them. The current rental price of each book (about 20 to 24 pamphlets) is 200 yuan. As long as it is rented out six times, the cost can be recovered. If you are frugal, a book stall can support a family of four.

Handling by the Authorities

Currently, the published comic books must first be inspected and reviewed by the Book, Newspaper, Film and Drama Section of the Welfare Culture Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, and can only be printed and distributed after approval. In order to review the book, the content must not involve any evil thoughts, and even errors in punctuation marks must be corrected before submitting for review again. Therefore, bad comic strips have gradually been eliminated, so as not to become harmful reading materials for society. I hope the authorities can take further action.

### Ostrich Gentlemen

— Guizhou

Before the outbreak of the Pacific War, some pure "Hong Kong people" were ridiculed as "ostriches" because they were "not very concerned" about the War of Resistance Against Japan. Regardless of whether Hong Kong people should be called "ostriches", the fact that the situation in Hong Kong is different from other parts of the country is an undeniable fact. This is because Hong Kong has been ruled by the British, who are good at "governing", for more than a hundred years. There are so-called "Chinese gentlemen" or "higher Chinese" in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government is quite "polite" to these gentlemen, and consults with them on matters concerning the Chinese, and they must "consult" them when they want money and effort. When the amount of money and effort they put in is considerable, the order is directly sent from London for commendation, or to be made a "爵士." The title of "爵士" is amazing in Hong Kong!

However, sometimes the British will put on airs. In 1939, the British were building a school, and a certain "Chinese gentleman", in order to ingratiate himself, voluntarily donated a huge sum of money. After the school was completed, he wanted to send his young master to school, but the British refused politely, saying that this school was exclusively for British children. If your son wants to study, please go to another school!

In a place ruled by foreigners, even if you can get temporary "favor," the spirit is still painful.

At present, there should be no more ostriches!

### The Fattest Man in the World:

He is twenty years old this year, and his name is Hafers. He is the heaviest person in the world, weighing seven hundred and ten pounds. Seven weaklings like us, who weigh about a hundred pounds, are not as good as one of him. The pair of pants he is wearing has . He wears size eleven canvas shoes, because leather shoes are extremely uncomfortable for him.

Common Knowledge

### Unit Names

— Yao Qi

Don't Be Messy Anymore

In our country, just browsing through a daily newspaper, or a book or magazine, or anything with numerical records; the confusion and chaos in the use of unit names, except for those with specialized nature, the most common ones are really chaotic and unmatched. Please see below:

Length: Li, Zhang, Chi, Cun, Fen, 市里, 市尺, 市寸, Kilometer, Meter, Centimeter, 基羅米達, 米達, 生的米達, Mile, Foot, Inch, 哩, 呎, 吋, Yard. Weight: Tianping scale's 祖, Jin, Liang, 市秤's 祖, Shi, Liang, Pound, 唡 (Ounce), Kilogram, Metric ton, English ton (Heavy ton 2240 lbs), American ton (Light ton 2000 lbs), Sima 祖 (used for cotton batting)

Capacity: Shi, 市石, Gallon, Liter, Cubic meter, English cubic (used for yellow sand and gravel)

Area: Mu, 市畝, 噋, Acre, Are, Square 市尺, Square feet, Square meter, Square mile, Square kilometer.

Currency: 法幣, 關金...

In these many names mentioned above, in fact mile...inch and 哩...吋 and kilometer...centimeter and 基羅米達...生的米達 are each the same length. If the speaker or writer is a little careful, it can make the uneducated general public clear at a glance and not get it wrong. Now that the government has stipulated the adoption of the 市制, then the old 里, 尺, Tianping scale, 石, 畝...etc. can be abandoned; although in practical use it may be difficult to correct at one time, but in writing, you can convert them, as a way to advocate.

In the same record, two or even more unit names are often used. For example, acres are written, then , and then are used, and then square miles are used. It should be known that the area of mu, , and are are not small numbers, so that even if it is the same number, the reader cannot get an accurate concept for a while. From comparison, people who do not know the mutual relationship between mu, , are, and square miles are even more confused.

What is even more ridiculous is that when recording the area, distance, quantity, etc. of our country, instead of using the national system, the metric system is used, and even more people use the English system or other unit names, such as Shanghai to Hangzhou is about a hundred miles...etc., just like Rong Desheng's kidnapping case, the ransom must be calculated in US dollars instead of 法幣. Therefore, some people will mark domestic goods with US dollars and appear in the domestic market!

Some people read 3, 4175, 9862 as three hundred forty-one million seven hundred fifty-nine thousand eight hundred sixty-two, but there are more people who still read it as three ten thousand ten thousand four hundred seventeen million five hundred ninety-eight hundred sixty-two. (This number should be written as 3, 0000, 4175, 9862)

Now the Legislative Yuan has passed the standard law, I hope that in the future it can gradually become standard!

### Leftover After Editing

— Jingcao

1. Checking Tickets

Ticket checker: "Why didn't you buy a ticket? Which department are you from? No! If you don't buy a ticket! Get off the bus!"

Soldier: "I am an officer after being discharged from the surplus staff, because I have no money, so I had to take a free ride once. I'm sorry, please forgive me a little bit!"

Ticket checker: "No money, who believes it?" (Urging a military police officer next to him) "Please check him to see if he has any money."

Military police officer: (Turns over the things taken out of the soldier's bag, counting and reciting) "A soldier's manual, a discharge certificate, a wound badge, sixty points in postage stamps, two pieces of draft paper, a needle, and thirty-five yuan in 法幣. That's it!"

Ticket checker: "Really..." Gave the soldier a blank look.

2. Inspection

Military police officer: "Comrade, may I ask which unit are you from?"

Soldier: "Surplus staff officer."

Military police officer: "Since you are discharged from the surplus staff, you should wear plain clothes, and there are no badges or symbols."

Soldier: "I don't have money to buy plain clothes."

Military police officer: "No, you have to come to the team with me, there is nothing to say."

Soldier: "Okay." (Thinking in his heart: I haven't eaten anything for two meals, I have to give me food when I go to their troops.)

### Divorce in America

— George

Divorce in the eyes of Americans is not a tragedy, but a game.

According to official American statistics in September of this year: the total number of marriages last year was 1,618,331 couples, and 31% have declared divorce. On average, one out of every three new families established last year has broken up.

In 1930, there were only 192,000 divorce cases nationwide in the United States, and in 1940, the number had increased to 264,000.

In 1938, there were a total of 400,000 people who got married in the United Kingdom, but there were also as many as 24,000 people who got divorced in that year. The ratio of divorce to marriage in the UK is 1 to 17. From January 1 to August 20 this year, there have been 17,500 divorce cases in the UK—that is, 35,000 people. There are an average of about 20,000 divorce cases in France each year.

### Birth Figures

The United States has 2.15 million people each year, Japan has 2.19 million people, and Germany has 1.27 million children. The United Kingdom has 600,000 people, and France has 630,000 people.

France is not only lagging behind in population birth rate, but also lost 3 million strong men in the two world wars, resulting in a phenomenon where there are more women than men - a ratio of about 109 to 100. Therefore, France established the "French Ministry of Population" a few years ago, and recently the Ministry has drafted a plan to encourage childbirth. Every married couple can get a loan of 80,000 to 100,000 法郎, to be repaid in installments over ten years, and for each child born, a deduction of 20,000 法郎 can be made. If there are five children in one birth, then this debt can be cleared with one stroke.

After all, France is a civilized country, unlike Germany under Hitler's rule, which forced monks to break the precepts and nuns to become public prostitutes in order to "encourage" childbirth.

### Low Profile

— Ge Zhensheng

The Communist military leader He Long inadvertently revealed the Communist Party's "progress": He pointed to the "Liberated Areas" and said, "Nine hundred dan of grain rotted in the grain bureau at once... Financial and commercial institutions become corrupt, embezzling tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands (of 'border currency,' of course!)... The chief of the materials section of the Ministry of Health, the things he alone embezzled were enough for his wife, children, nanny, and others to squander for seven years!" No wonder the pro-Communist American journalist Mr. Fairbank also said: The "situation" after the Communists came to power is unknowable.

The state is like a pregnant woman, and the materials received should be like the fetus in the womb. And the officials receiving (the materials) are actually just like midwives. If the materials rot or are looted, it's no different from the midwife committing a heinous act, cutting off a piece of flesh from the mother's womb—truly, piece after piece, slice after slice—truly bloody and tearful—Do you think this fetus is still useful? And how much suffering does this pregnant woman endure?

The destruction or bombing of transportation is similar to "looting." Let me give an example right before our eyes: a train near Chengde, Rehe, was bombed in a tunnel, and there was no way to deal with it, so they had to use hydrogen flames to melt it and then take out pieces, one piece at a time. Such things cannot be repaired, and it is too expensive to repair them. Alas, the little life is lost, and even the mother's body is almost gone. I send a message to those who destroy transportation, please imagine the indescribable pain of this pregnant woman, our country!

If daughters are cheap, are men worth any more? With the ban on dancing, it is said that dance hostesses have already entered the "fire pit" from the dance halls, changing their waists for "pillow recommendations," and this is what is called "changing careers." Now, rickshaws are gradually being banned, and if practical ways to change careers are not considered as soon as possible, the "fire pit" for rickshaw pullers may also be unavoidable, but it is not known where that is.

### Mr. Wu Tiecheng

— Jifeng

Recently, the newspapers have frequently carried Mr. Wu Tiecheng's speeches, and not long ago, there were rumors that Mr. Wu would lead the Hebei-Wan region, which made me think of this former mayor who had made great contributions to the history of Shanghai. Undoubtedly, among the past mayors of Shanghai, Mr. Wu left the deepest impression on the people of Shanghai.

When Mr. Wu took office as the mayor of Shanghai on January 7, 1932, just three weeks later, the "January 28th" Incident broke out in Songhu. At this time, the urgency of the situation and the danger of the situation were imaginable to anyone. Most of his subordinates were at a loss, but Mr. Wu went to the government office as usual every day, participated in military affairs (Mr. Wu was originally a soldier), negotiated diplomacy, and worked all night. Later, he also experienced the battles of the Great Wall and Suiyuan-East, as well as the Xi'an Incident. In the city of Shanghai, where Chinese and foreigners lived together and the relationship was complicated, it was most difficult and not easy to please to deal with the special forces of foreigners who were good at instigating incidents, and to deal with the residents of uneven quality. However, from 1932 to 1937, in these five years, Mr. Wu handled them properly, ensuring the safety and happiness of the city's four million residents, and also carefully managed the construction of the city center, which can be said to have achieved both civil and military achievements.

A Socialite

Mr. Wu was very good at socializing. During his tenure as the mayor of Shanghai, he often held tea parties to entertain Chinese and foreign guests. He gladly accepted invitations from community groups to give speeches. Although his eloquence was not very good, his demeanor was extremely dignified and generous when he spoke. He even enjoyed attending the opening of stores and theaters. When the Great New Amusement Park opened in 1936, Mr. Wu said in his speech: "I am not a master. I am willing to participate in everything that is beneficial and meaningful to society."

However, Mr. Wu's social skills were not used to "show off." In 1935, all walks of life in Shanghai, in view of Mr. Wu's great achievements in the local area, initiated the establishment of the "Mayor Wu Memorial Pavilion," but Mr. Wu firmly declined and sent a letter to all walks of life requesting the cancellation of the agreement. March 7, 1937, was Mr. Wu's 50th birthday. Relatives, friends, colleagues, and people from all walks of life were prepared to raise their glasses and celebrate, which scared Mr. Wu into sneaking away to Wuxi on the 7th to avoid the birthday celebration, only gathering with people from the press on the evening of the 6th.

Mr. Wu was tall and strong and advocated sports very much. He himself was also a sports athlete. During his time in Shanghai, he made two major contributions to sports: one was the completion of the sports ground in the city center, and the other was the planning of the National Games held in Shanghai. When the National Games opened, Mr. Wu often kicked off the ball and awarded prizes in the field.

An Old Truck

Mr. Wu was from Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province. He studied in the United States and Japan in his early years. During the Xinhai Revolution, he served as the Deputy Chief of Staff and Commissioner of Foreign Affairs of the Jiujiang Military Government. In 1920, he served as the Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression Army, and later served as the Military Counselor of the Presidential Palace, the Commander of the Guangdong Provincial Guard Army, the Director of the Guangdong Provincial Police Department and the Director of the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, and the Commander of the Guangzhou Garrison. In 1931, Zhang Qun resigned from his position as the mayor of Shanghai, and Mr. Wu took over. In 1937, he was transferred to Guangdong, his "first hometown" (Mr. Wu called Shanghai his second hometown). It was during the outbreak of the War of Resistance. Mr. Wu organized the people in Guangdong and promoted the people's spirit with all his strength. In 1939, he resigned as the chairman of the provincial government and took a position in the central government, currently serving as the Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters. He came to Shanghai in May of this year. After eight years of anti-Japanese war work, Mr. Wu is not as strong as before, but he told reporters: "This time I came to Shanghai to examine my body, I want to repair this old truck and work with you middle-aged and young people to contribute to the country!"
