### New Policies to be Implemented in Recovered Counties of Hebei Province

[Special Dispatch from Beiping, This Newspaper, 7th] As the Nationalist army in Hebei Province advances smoothly, the Hebei Provincial Government has decided on a major policy to engage in political struggle with the Communist Party. This new policy concerns the land issue in the recovered counties, and it is decided to follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teaching of "land to the tiller." Poor farmers who originally had land divided under the Communist Party's rule will continue to use the land they have divided after the Nationalist army recovers it, and the local authorities must not take it back. However, the landlords still retain "ownership." It is generally believed that this policy, if implemented thoroughly, will have a significant impact.

### Yang Zhengchun, Commander of the Communist Army's Coastal Defense Area in Eastern Hebei, Defects with His Troops; More than 10,000 People Surrender and Join the Nationalist Army

[Dispatch from Tianjin, Central News Agency, 7th] Yang Zhengchun, commander of the Communist Army's Coastal Defense Area in Eastern Hebei, Chief of Staff Liu Fengxu, together with Sun Shengsan, Commissioner of the Eastern Hebei Special Administrative Office, defected with more than 10,000 troops and militiamen, and sent representatives to Peiping to discuss surrender matters. It is reported that Yang's unit was established in the 28th year of the Republic (1939). Finally, it moved from Ninghe to the area of Nanbei Zhaogezhuang in Fengrun. Since the defection, the unit has been pursued by the 13th Brigade of the Communist New Fourth Army. The defecting part has been coordinating with the Nationalist army to fight them. Yang Zhengchun has also personally gone to Peiping to meet with Director Li to report everything and issued a circular telegram, the original text of which is as follows: "Since the Lugouqiao Incident, the national affairs have been in turmoil. All of us Chinese people have been inspired to volunteer to kill the enemy and be pioneers for the people. Zhengchun and others, originally a humble martial artist and a later descendant of Yugam, gathered armed comrades and resolutely rose up. Later, we were confused by the theory of the national united anti-Japanese front and joined the Eighth Route Army. Over the past eight years, we have fought on the coast, with no fewer than 300 battles and repeatedly defeating strong enemies. Later, we were shocked by the Communist Party's order to wander without attacking, retreating as the enemy advanced, eliminating dissidents, and annihilating the Central Army. We did not know what to do. However, compelled by the situation and to ensure the overall anti-Japanese situation, we dared not express dissent. Fortunately, the country regained its light and the War of Resistance was victorious, and the rivers and mountains were restored, and all the people rejoiced. Who would have thought that the Communist Party would suddenly change its course, establish its own political orders, seize cities and land, and attack the Nationalist army, without end, destroying railways, wantonly killing innocent people, destroying fields and burning houses, conscripting men, cutting off transportation, village cadres acting tyrannically, those who harbor resentment being abandoned, poor parties acting rampant, those who whisper being executed. Who has no parents, forced to embark on the path of struggle? Who has no sisters, humiliated by being conscripted for comfort? This has led loyal and kind people to abandon their homes and flee far away, with their families scattered and wandering in foreign lands. Every time Zhengchun thinks of this, he is filled with anger and wants to die. Later, with the Central Government's leniency, it has repeatedly convened peace conferences. Zhengchun had hoped for a satisfactory solution, the cessation of war, and the heavy task of jointly building the country. However, there are great mistakes. The negotiations have stopped, and the Chinese Communist Party's aim of long-term talks is a plan to delay. Attacking cities and looting warehouses is what they are doing now. They are ordered to destroy the Beining Railway, occupy nearby strongholds, steal and attack the Nationalist army, and launch a civil war. Zhengchun believes that the world situation is extremely chaotic, and the survival of the country is at stake. The Communist Party's actions are truly heartbreaking. The people are aroused and can no longer bear it. We have decided to immediately lead our officers and soldiers, more than 10,000 people, to defect and await orders from the Central Government, to uphold the unified government, to eliminate the plotters of constitutional nations, to eliminate the unfilial Communist bandits, to be of one heart and one mind, and to forever obey the Central Government's will. These are our humble intentions."

[Special Dispatch from Taixian, This Newspaper, 7th] The fighting around Hai'an is still ongoing. Last night, the Communist army bombarded with intense artillery fire and charged several times, but all failed. The morale of the defending troops is high and they are responding calmly, so the Communist army's attempt to occupy the town is almost a dream. This afternoon, the Air Force dropped supplies, medicine, and other items into the town, but a few items were mistakenly dropped in Jiangyan.

[Special Dispatch from Taixian, This Newspaper, 7th] More than 1,000 Communist soldiers north of Huangqiao continued to attack Dasizhuang today. The fighting was fierce and did not stop until late at night.

[Dispatch from Nanjing, This Newspaper, 7th] Although the five representatives of the informal five-person group are all in Beijing, contact activities have apparently come to a standstill again due to Special Envoy Marshall's trip to Guling. The current situation seems to be waiting for Special Envoy Ma to fly to Guling to report and for Zhou Enlai to expect a reply from Yan'an before a final decision can be made, so hope has been pinned on the next few days again. Recently, the Communist Party has repeatedly hyped up a bad atmosphere, and there are more pessimistic views. However, how exactly it will be, it is feared that it will only become clear after Special Envoy Marshall returns to Beijing. Also, it was rumored yesterday that Ambassador Stuart would be flying to Shanghai on the 7th, but it is now known that this will not become a reality within days.

### Hebei High Court Announced Yesterday: Traitor Wang Yitang Sentenced to Death; Presiding Judge Announced Right to Appeal

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 7th] The Hebei High Court announced the death sentence for Wang Yitang on the 7th. Due to Wang's physical inability to move, the sentencing was held in a temporary court within the First Prison. At 11:00 AM, prison guards carried Wang out of his cell. After customary inquiries, Presiding Judge He Chengzhuo stood up and read the main text of the verdict: "Wang Yitang colluded with the enemy to plot against the country, engaging in treason against his own nation, sentenced to death, deprived of all civil rights for life, all assets confiscated except for a reasonable amount to provide for the necessary living expenses of his family." He also informed Wang that he had the right to appeal. Wang remained silent throughout. He was then carried back to his cell. It is generally expected that Wang Dao, who previously requested execution in court, will not appeal. The death penalty may be carried out quickly, but it is also possible that it will not be carried out immediately, and Wang may die at any moment, as Wang's current physical and mental state is already close to death. Wang's eldest son, Deyan, and second son, Deyin, are both in Spain. His third son, Derui, is engaged in business in India and Burma. His two daughters are married and reside in Shanghai. They recently came to Beiping and are staying at the German Hospital, seemingly waiting quietly to handle their father's affairs. Wang's old residence at No. 3 Zhao Tangzi Hutong, with its carved beams and painted rafters, is covered in dust, and the courtyard is desolate. No family members remain there. A notice from the reception office of the Eleventh War Zone Headquarters has been posted on the door.

### Executive Headquarters Review Meeting Concludes Today; Jiang Tingfu Announced Important Decisions Yesterday; Negotiating Food Exchange Methods with the Ministry of Food

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] The Executive Headquarters work review meeting held its third general assembly on the morning of the 7th, hearing reports from various sub-groups. After the meeting, Director-General Jiang Tingfu announced that the conference would close on the afternoon of the 8th, hoping that the meeting could proceed quickly and that the heads of the various sub-headquarters could quickly return to their original posts. He continued, stating that he would give careful consideration to the resolutions made by the various sub-groups and would do his best to comply. However, due to the difficulties of transportation and special resources, he dared not promise full compliance. In other words, the sub-group resolutions were not binding. Then, the conveners of the Relief and other five sub-groups reported separately, and Director-General Jiang expressed his views on the reports of each sub-group. Jiang announced at the meeting: (1) Important decision: the headquarters is currently negotiating food exchange methods with the Ministry of Food to reduce transportation costs and find transportation. The meeting adjourned at around 12:00 PM. In the afternoon, the seventh sub-group continued to meet to discuss the liaison between the operations of the various sub-headquarters. At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, Director-General Jiang convened a symposium of the heads of the various sub-headquarters to discuss administrative issues. The review meeting is scheduled to hold its fourth general assembly on the morning of the 8th, to hear reports from the sixth and seventh groups, and Deputy Director-General Zhuo will report on the experience of attending the Fifth General Assembly of the United Relief in Washington. The closing ceremony will be held in the afternoon.

Resettlement of Refugees to End by Year's End

The first to report among the sub-groups was the Relief Group. Convener emphasized the resettlement of refugees, and the group resolved that all refugee resettlement would be handled until the end of this year. If there are excessive numbers of refugees, insufficient transportation, or a practical necessity, it can be continued until the end of March next year. Regarding the resettlement of overseas Chinese, it was decided to begin immediately, tentatively until the end of May next year as an initial conclusion, and if necessary, it can be extended as appropriate, and priority should be given to the resettlement of overseas Chinese engineers and those who have already gathered at Haikou. Jiang instructed on this matter: The resettlement of refugees in North China must be determined based on the railway transportation situation, and secondly, it must be based on whether their hometowns are peaceful; otherwise, they will still be refugees after returning home.

Hoping to Overcome the Food Crisis

When the convener of the Agricultural Rehabilitation Sub-group reported, Jiang instructed the group: The Executive Headquarters must repay 10 billion yuan to the Central Bank every month starting in October, which is economically difficult. Therefore, it is hoped that the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry can take more responsibility in this regard. He continued to explain that the United Relief is still needed for assistance with food in order to overcome the difficulties of June, July and August next year.

Principles Proposed for the Allocation of Machinery

The Industrial and Mining Rehabilitation Sub-group was reported by Zhang Ziyue. Regarding the application of various factories for the allocation of machinery, the group proposed the following principles: (1) Industrial and mining enterprises in the recovered areas that have been damaged can apply; (2) It is limited to restoring to the pre-war situation. In terms of pricing, efforts should be made to be fair. In terms of payment methods, it is proposed to pay 15% to 25% initially, with the balance to be paid in installments, with a term of five to ten years. Jiang's instructions on this matter were: The industrial and mining industry is a productive industry and should serve the interests of the entire people, and should not only consider the private interests of a few people. Furthermore, the Executive Headquarters is not responsible for wartime loss compensation. Regarding the payment in installments, Jiang also believed that there were difficulties, as it was impossible to predict what the currency and prices would evolve into in the future, and the Executive Headquarters itself was a short-term institution. Some sub-headquarters will be closed next year. After the Executive Headquarters is closed, the future income should be allocated to local health undertakings.

Health Reports Attract the Most Attention

The health report was the issue that attracted the most attention at the conference. The Executive Headquarters decided to ask the Ministry of Health to take charge of this matter. Jiang said: "I have always attached great importance to health undertakings, but now I have reached a stage where I am powerless. If I cannot raise funds, tell me to kidnap and rob. I will do it," and cited the example of someone advocating robbing the golden Bodhisattva during the revolution, hoping that those present could tell him the location of the golden Bodhisattva. His words were humorous and poignant, and the atmosphere at the meeting lightened up a lot. Jiang also warned the heads of the various sub-headquarters that the expenses of the sub-headquarters would be adjusted, and hoped that they could do their best to economize.

Streamlining Procedures for Transportation, Procurement, and Sales

Finally, Liu Hongsheng reported on the review of the proposals of the Materials Transportation, Distribution, Procurement, and Sales Sub-group. In addition to mentioning that the transportation fee of 43,400,000 yuan was difficult to raise, he put forward two points, hoping that the various sub-headquarters could simplify procedures to save expenses. Liu believed that the biggest problem at present was the failure to entrust specialized people to handle specialized business, resulting in most of the transportation, procurement, and sales being handled by merchants. At the same time, the use of landing craft to transport materials also had many shortcomings. However, he guaranteed that 100,000 tons of materials could be transported to Hankou. After his speech, Jiang made a concluding remark: "We work one day, so we transport for one day. Therefore, transportation work must not be ignored, and the amount of materials that each sub-headquarters will receive in the future depends on the speed and quantity of its transportation. Any warehouse with accumulated materials will not be supplied with materials by the headquarters." Jiang expressed great dissatisfaction with transportation, believing that the highway transportation team had failed and must be reorganized, and he would not hesitate to cancel it.

Jiang Announced Important Facts

Jiang finally announced an important fact, that is, in order to avoid the food that the headquarters had worked so hard to transport to various places from being requisitioned by the Ministry of Food, and the Ministry of Food having to find a way to transport it out again, suffering both ways, it was negotiating exchange methods with the Ministry of Food to save transportation costs and tools for transporting other materials. This matter is justified and is bound to be carried out. Therefore, he asked the various sub-headquarters to provide the locations for exchanging food so as to negotiate with the Ministry of Food.

### Hebei-Rehe-Chahar-Suiyuan Investigation Team Continues to Uncover Hidden Reporting Cases; Concealment of Antiques Being Investigated for Responsibility

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 7th] The Hebei-Rehe-Chahar-Suiyuan Investigation Team announced on the 7th: On the 6th, a case of hidden reporting of received materials was uncovered overnight. The case involved Mao Jichuan, director of the Beijing Yanjing Paper Mill, which was taken over by the Ministry of Economy, and two others who failed to report the receipt of three cars, two tricycles, and various machines such as a polishing machine and a filtration machine. The three were arrested and released on bail pending trial.

More Than a Hundred Creditors Crowded in to Listen

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 7th] The sensational fraud case involving Zhang Fengshi and Wang Yifei in Wuhan has been repeatedly investigated and searched by the Criminal Court of the Hankou District Court, which took a lot of trouble.

Now I want them to take the money out with a clear conscience." When Wang Yifei was questioned, Wang said, "What evidence do you have that your money was placed here with me? You are defrauding people and want to blame me." The other defendants, Wang Zhao and Liang Jiamao, also denied everything and refused to tell the truth.

### President Yu Returns to Nanjing from Shaanxi; Meets with Reporters to Discuss Impressions of Western Tour; Lasting Peace in Xinjiang Can Certainly be Realized

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] "This time, when I returned from the Northwest, the various ethnic groups in the Northwest entrusted me to say hello to everyone, they are also very well, and what they most hope is that everyone will work together to create a new China of the Three People's Principles." This was the first thing President Yu Youren said to a Central News Agency reporter after flying from Xi'an to Nanjing on the afternoon of the 7th. Yu continued to tell reporters at his official residence, "The various ethnic cultures in Xinjiang each have their own strengths. Because of the barriers of writing and language, it is often not easy for outsiders to understand. No matter where I went, the people were strong, lively, and enterprising, and very lovable." Yu spoke highly of Chairman Zhang's efforts to govern, saying: "The new provincial government is a democratic organization. People of all ethnic groups participated in it, and everyone was united and worked together to move forward.

Editorial

### US Reiterates Policy on Germany

US Secretary of State Byrnes traveled from Paris to Germany the day before yesterday, where he delivered a speech in Stuttgart, outlining the US policy on Germany. The main points were fivefold: (1) He advocated that Germany should immediately establish a temporary central government; (2) The US does not want to see Germany become a vassal of any major power or bloc, nor does it want to see the German people subjected to dictators again; (3) The British, American, French, and Soviet occupation zones should eliminate all barriers to ensure complete economic unification of Germany; (4) A German National Committee should be established under the control of the United Nations to handle national affairs and draft a constitution to form a permanent federal state of Germany; (5) The US opposes Germany ceding the Saar region to France and the Königsberg region to the Soviet Union.

Before departing for Germany, Byrnes met with French Foreign Minister Bidault to exchange views on the German issue and expressed his willingness to notify the French authorities of the draft speech in advance. This shows that Byrnes's speech was not only fully endorsed by Britain, but also received considerable understanding from France. However, the Slavic countries, especially the Soviet Union and Poland, are bound to express their objections, and may even believe that Byrnes's speech violates the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement, which is also unknown. However, the Soviet Union must have known about Byrnes's trip to Berlin long ago. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, on his way back to Paris from Moscow, spent some time in Berlin and must have made arrangements to counteract the reaction caused by Byrnes's speech. Therefore, Byrnes's speech is not only related to the future destiny of Germany, but even the division and union of the entire Europe can be seen in this trip to Berlin.

Since Germany surrendered on May 9th last year, the European war can be considered over. How to deal with the aftermath of the war in Europe and how to control the defeated Nazi Germany, it is logical that the major powers should have discussed a concrete solution long ago, so that European countries can return to normal as soon as possible. Unexpectedly, when the three giants of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union met in Potsdam, because the war against Japan had not yet ended, everyone's energy was focused on the war against Japan, and they had no time to take care of the defeated Germany. Therefore, only a few methods were decided in principle. After Japan surrendered, the foreign ministers of the five countries met in London to discuss the European peace issue, but because of the differences in interests between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, they broke up unhappily, and the European issue fell into a stalemate. Until now, the German issue is still like a mess, and there is no way to clean it up.

However, Germany has been occupied by the four countries of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union for more than a year. During this year, Germany seems to have been dismembered by the major powers and split into four countries, not only politically unified, but also economically unified. The heavy burden of military expenses has overwhelmed the German people, and the artificial barriers have prevented the flow of materials. The general German people feel the difficulties of life and the vagueness of the new Germany. Even the British and American occupation authorities feel that the current situation, if not improved, will eventually make the purpose of occupying Germany—(1) eradicating the remaining evils of Nazism, (2) disarming Germany, (3) democratizing German politics, (4) preventing Germany from rising again to aggression and threatening world peace, etc.—impossible to achieve. The three countries of Britain, the United States, and France, therefore, all want to improve Germany's legal status. At the second Paris Conference of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers, the foreign ministers of Britain and the United States put forward the German issue for discussion, advocating the merger of the four occupation zones and the unification of economic institutions, but they were opposed by the Soviet foreign minister, and no agreement could be reached. Molotov only agreed to convene a conference of foreign ministers of the four countries again after the closing of the United Nations General Assembly in September to specifically discuss the German issue. However, it is not certain whether the United Nations General Assembly can be held as scheduled, and it is even more unknown when the German issue will be discussed after the United Nations General Assembly.

Byrnes, with the qualifications of a first-class American diplomat, faces reality squarely and knows the difficulty of solving the German issue. He changed his approach, avoiding the important and focusing on the minor, starting with the merger of the economic institutions of the British and American occupation zones. The two sides immediately conducted negotiations and announced the agreement on the 5th of this month. Byrnes's speech in Germany this time, explaining the US policy on Germany, has a profound meaning. France will follow in the footsteps of Britain and join the economic institutions of the British and American occupation zones, which is unlikely to be a problem; the only problem is the Soviet Union. At that time, the confrontation between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union in Europe will become more exposed, and the division of Europe into "East" and "West" may become inevitable. At the same time, if the United Nations General Assembly is postponed, it is unknown when the German issue will be discussed!

In short, standing on the position of a third party, analyzing the speech delivered by Byrnes, we finally feel that the United States' attitude towards the defeated country can be called bright, generous, and benevolent, which is not to be blamed. Because what the United States needs is a reasonable and lasting peace, it opposes any measures based on "revenge." We only hope that those who want to impose revenge on the defeated country will reconsider the generosity of the United States.

Corrigendum

In yesterday's editorial "People-to-People Diplomacy between China and the United States," the character "共" in the fourteenth character of the second paragraph was mistakenly printed as "央". This is hereby corrected.

### Prosper Taiwan: Chen Yi is Confident of Achieving the Goal

[Special Correspondent of the United Press, Taipei, 6th] Taiwan fell into the hands of the Japanese for as long as fifty years, and now it has been returned to China. During the decades of Japanese occupation, Taiwan has developed considerably, but most of the factories were destroyed during the war, and the people's degree of Japanization is also very deep. Therefore, how the Chinese government will accept the wealth left by the Japanese and make the prosperous Taiwan prosper is a very important issue. Chen Yi, the Chief Executive of Taiwan, is confident that Taiwan can achieve this goal under his administration.

At a recent press conference, Chen said: The work of changing Taiwan from a Japanese colony to a province of China is quite slow and tortuous. And the island's restoration work is also difficult due to the severe air raids and other damages suffered during the war.

He said: Japan's policy in Taiwan was that the Japanese were superior to the local people in all aspects, and they occupied key positions in all aspects of life. Due to the repatriation of the Japanese, there is a serious lack of manpower, and there are no suitable people to replace these important positions.

According to Chief Executive Chen: In the forty-five days ending April 30, 1946, with the assistance of the US military, a total of 117,000 Japanese soldiers and 290,000 civilians were repatriated. To illustrate the lack of manpower caused by the repatriation work, Chen pointed out that among the 290,000 Japanese civilians who returned to their country, 7,000 were police officers and 11,600 were primary and secondary school teachers.

Chen also said: The plan of the Chief Executive's Office is to replace the Japanese with Taiwanese as much as possible. As for the more important positions, they must be held by civil servants from mainland China, because the Taiwanese are not competent enough. All the local people who are selected to replace the Japanese are given specialized training in advance.

In terms of materials, Taiwan is also in extreme shortage. Japan's economic policy in Taiwan has always been "Japan First" doctrine. For most of the period that Japan occupied the island, Taiwan has always been an agricultural unit in the entire plan of the Japanese Empire. Until before the outbreak of the Pacific War and during the war, the Japanese began to develop Taiwan industrially. As a result, Taiwan became completely dependent on Japan.

To illustrate this point, Chen pointed out the following facts: He said that the Japanese encouraged Taiwanese to use chemical fertilizers, consuming as much as 500,000 tons each year, but the island did not produce any of these chemical fertilizers. Until shortly before the end of the war, a few small chemical fertilizer plants were built. In the first half of this year, Taiwan urgently needed 250,000 tons of fertilizer, but only 2,500 tons shipped by the United Nations were imported.

One of the main difficulties in restoring Taiwan's industry is that there are no new machines, parts, and tools to assemble into the factories built by the Japanese. Several factories that supplied this equipment have been bombed, and others have been shut down.

The lack of transportation constitutes another obstacle to the island's restoration. Japanese ships traveling to and from Taiwan's ports were requisitioned by the Japanese Navy during the war and sunk or damaged. There are no regular schedules for the available ships, and they are not designed to cope with large-scale trade. Only China Airlines operates a three-times-a-week flight route.

The island's highways and railways have been badly damaged due to wartime neglect and bombing. The authorities have encountered difficulties in importing motor vehicles. However, although railway vehicles are in short supply and bridges and tracks are damaged, trains still run on a regular schedule.

Another difficulty encountered in Taiwan's administration is the language barrier. Most Taiwanese migrated from Fujian and speak the so-called Southern Min language or Amoy dialect. When the Japanese controlled the island, they tried their best to promote Japanese spoken language and writing. As a result, Taiwanese lost their ability to use the national language.

Chief Executive Chen believes that in the summer of 1947, all school books in Taiwan will be in the national language. 70% to 80% of Taiwanese students have been able to use the national language after training in special language schools.

Taiwan's most famous Chinese newspapers still retain the Japanese version to facilitate readers, but it will be discontinued in late October, but some readers have requested that it be continued for some time.

At the press conference, Chief Executive Chen admitted that the salaries of most civil servants from mainland China are higher than those of local Taiwanese. He said: The living standards of civil servants from mainland China are higher than those of local Taiwanese, and they are far away from their hometowns, so their expenses are naturally greater. He denied that there was any discrimination against Taiwanese and declared that anyone with better qualifications should naturally be given higher salaries.

Chen stated that in view of the inflation on mainland China, the Taiwan dollar will continue to be used for some time. If a unified currency system is implemented at this time, the result will inevitably cause serious economic repercussions among the Taiwanese. The exchange rate of the Taiwan dollar was previously set at 20 legal tender dollars to 1 Taiwan dollar. The Taiwanese people requested the Executive Yuan to revise the exchange rate to 40 to 1, which is still pending a decision from Nanjing. At the same time, the exchange of Taiwan dollars with mainland China is temporarily suspended.

Chief Executive Chen revealed that the real estate formerly owned by Japanese nationals or the Japanese government that has now been taken over by the provincial government will be leased directly to farmers as a form of assistance. It is reported that the authorities have drafted a plan to establish cooperatives to provide farmers with technical and economic assistance.

Chen also announced that Taiwanese people will have equal opportunities to participate in administrative institutions at all levels—including village councils elected by popular vote and provincial councils.

The Greek cabinet, after two and a half hours of discussion, has decided to implement extraordinary measures. On the other hand, the opposition actions of the communists have become more intense.

[Reuters, Athens, 7th] Greek Deputy Prime Minister Gonatas announced today that the security measures withdrawn on the eve of the plebiscite have been restored.

### Soviet Union Supports at the Peace Conference, Bulgaria Makes Demands on Greece, South Country's Representatives Cheer, Czech-Hungarian Border Issue Arises Again

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 6th] The Peace Conference's Committee on Bulgarian Territory and Politics held a meeting this afternoon, where Soviet representative Novikov spoke, arguing that regarding the border between Bulgaria and Greece, the exit to the Aegean Sea, namely the western part of Thrace Province, should be ceded to Bulgaria, and that Greece's request for a part of Bulgaria's territory is not justified and should not be granted. Yugoslav representative Bijet also spoke, attacking the Greek government for being greedy and saying that Greece's attitude is enough to endanger world peace. Greece is the only country in the Balkan Peninsula that has failed to eradicate the reactionary monarchy. It is time to discuss the issue of the freedom of other people in Macedonia Province.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 6th] The Peace Conference's Committee on Hungarian Territory and Politics held a meeting this afternoon, where Czech representative Slavik spoke, demanding to revise the border between Hungary and the Czech Republic to allow the free development of the Bratislava region.

The representatives of the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and Ukraine all expressed their support for this, but the representatives of Britain and Australia expressed their objections and requested the committee to invite the Hungarian representative to state their opinions. The Hungarian representative then spoke, opposing the Czech Republic's demands, and said that most of the residents in the area are Hungarians. Finally, the New Zealand representative proposed to organize a three-person subcommittee to inspect the Hungarian-Czech border and study this issue on the spot.

### Czech Republic and Poland Sign Treaty of Friendship, Negotiations Reach a Stalemate

[Reuters, Prague, 6th] The negotiations on the Czech-Polish Treaty of Friendship, which were conducted in the four capitals of Moscow, Prague, Paris, and Warsaw, have reached a stalemate. The two countries originally agreed not to raise the territorial issue when negotiating this treaty. However, according to the Czech side, Poland demands rights for people of Polish nationality in the Czech Republic, which is an obstacle to the negotiations. The Czech government believes that most of these Polish people are miners and workers in the border area, and they have the same rights as Czech citizens, and enjoy special convenience in written and agricultural affairs. If Poland's demands are accepted, it will greatly hinder the Czech Republic's post-war policy.

### Germans Greatly Relieved to Hear Byrnes's Speech, Long-Term Policy Has Been Established for the Restoration of German Autonomy

[Reported by This Newspaper] London, 7th Broadcast: Byrnes's most trusted advisor on German policy said today that Byrnes's speech has bravely stated that once Germany fights for the door of democracy, the United States will take action to the end. The advisor added that the door struggle between the East and the West in Germany has actually begun.

[United Press, Washington, 6th] Senior State Department officials announced today that Secretary of State Byrnes's speech in Stuttgart, Germany, has placed the Soviet Union on the defensive diplomatically. This speech has set a long-term policy for the restoration of German autonomy, and is one of the most important declarations of US foreign policy. Byrnes's main purpose is to take a diplomatic offensive in Germany and put the Soviet Union on the defensive. Senior State Department officials based their views on the motives of Byrnes's speech, which were known in advance, and a comparison with the German policy announced by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov in Paris on July 10.

[United Press, Stuttgart, 6th] The administrative officers of the three states in the US occupation zone, who were the main Germans who listened to Byrnes's speech today, expressed their deep satisfaction afterwards, believing that Byrnes's words "are enough to warm the hearts of the German people." The administrative officers of the three German states are Dr. Hoegner of Bavaria, Dr. Meil of Baden, and Dr. Reuter of Greater Hesse.

### US Maritime Strike Expands: Number of Strikers Reaches 500,000; Over 2,500 Ships on Both Coasts Halt Operations; Seamen from Denmark, Norway, and Sweden Decide to Support

[United Press, New York, 6th] The number of American maritime strikers has reached 500,000. More than 2,500 ships in the Atlantic, Pacific, and various gulfs have ceased operations. The strikers are determined to continue until the Wage Stabilization Board withdraws its reduction and increase of wages. The employers agreed to a wage increase of $22.50, but the Wage Stabilization Board ruled for $17.50, whereas the current average monthly wage is $145. A spokesperson for the US Maritime Commission stated: This is the most wasteful strike in American maritime history. Transoceanic passenger transport has completely stopped, and the import and export of important industrial raw materials have also been disrupted.

United Nations relief supplies destined for Europe and Asia are also stranded on 125 ships. UNRRA Director LaGuardia, returning from Europe, stated: He will appeal to the striking stevedores to continue loading relief supplies to countries in need. The strike will cause the food on cargo ships to spoil. Maritime authorities have appealed to the seamen's union to keep the refrigeration equipment on ships running to prevent food spoilage. The strike is affecting the national economy. The Pacific American Shipowners Association has appealed to Truman to immediately intervene to resolve the situation. The union has no disputes with the employers, only with the government agency, so the employers are powerless.

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 6th] A spokesperson for the American Maritime Union recently announced: Seamen from Denmark, Norway, and Sweden have decided to dispatch pickets to ports in their respective countries to support the American maritime strike.

[United Press, Washington, 6th] The Department of the Army announced: The seamen's strike has spread nationwide. Food and other supplies for American occupation forces in Europe and Japan are also being hampered. Supplies for the occupation forces in Japan are particularly at a standstill. The overseas troops currently have enough supplies for six months, so there is no immediate crisis.

[Reuters, New York, 6th] Leaders of the Seamen's Union reported today that striking seamen have set up a blockade line in the New York dock area, preventing 534 ships in the port from moving. Officials said that a total of 2,534 ships are being held up along the US coasts.

### British Warship Sails to Trieste

[Reuters, Bari, 7th] The British cruiser HMS "Ajax" departed from here today for Trieste.

### US Conducting Thorough Study of the Status of Pacific Islands

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 6th] According to reliable sources: Officials here are deeply concerned about the future legal status of the Pacific islands. They are studying whether to occupy the islands entirely or partially, or to place them under the United Nations trusteeship. The US Army and Navy Departments believe that occupying these bases is essential for American security. These bases can be divided into three categories: (1) Pacific islands formerly mandated to Japan, namely the Mariana, Caroline, and Marshall Islands; (2) Territories formerly belonging to Japan, such as Okinawa; (3) Territories formerly under British rule and Australian trusteeship. The general consensus is as follows: For the first category, the US Army can decide the duration of occupation. For the second category, the US can seek to obtain trusteeship. For the third category, the US should also seek to obtain joint trusteeship. Some of these islands are strategically valuable and should be placed under military control; therefore, the issue is extremely complex.

### Soviet Union Still Has Not Repatriated Captured Japanese Soldiers; Japan Sends Letter Requesting MacArthur's Assistance; US Declares to the Soviet Union It Is Prepared to Provide Ships for Repatriation at Any Time

[United Press, Tokyo, 7th] The Japanese government has sent a letter to MacArthur Headquarters requesting assistance in repatriating 100,000 Japanese soldiers captured by the Soviet army. A copy of the letter has been forwarded to the US State Department. It states: Japanese prisoners in the Northeast must be repatriated before this winter, otherwise, 100,000 of them will inevitably die, as the Japanese in the Northeast are experiencing a severe shortage of food, clothing, fuel, and medicine.

(Another dispatch) The Soviet side of the Four-Power Control Commission for Japan expressed dissatisfaction with MacArthur Headquarters' refusal to provide ships for the evacuation of Japanese residents from the Soviet occupation zone. US representative Acheson replied today, stating: Soviet representative Telegin's unwillingness to discuss the repatriation of Japanese residents outside of North Korea and Eastern Manchuria is preventing a complete resolution of the issue, resulting in hundreds of thousands of Japanese combat personnel remaining in Soviet hands. Headquarters representatives have declared to Soviet representatives that Headquarters is fully prepared to provide sufficient ships to evacuate all Japanese residents and prisoners. Other countries have all fully agreed to the repatriation of Japanese residents and prisoners. With negotiations with Soviet representatives in Tokyo regarding the repatriation of Japanese residents and prisoners in the Soviet zone at a standstill, the US representative has reported the situation to Washington, and the US government will continue negotiations with the Soviet government. Approximately 800,000 Japanese soldiers captured by the Soviet Union in Eastern Manchuria and North Korea have not yet been repatriated.

### Nehru's First Broadcast Speech After Taking Office Expresses Concern About the Chinese Civil War

[This Newspaper] New Delhi, 7th Broadcast: Nehru, the leader of the new Indian government, delivered his first broadcast speech today after taking office, elaborating on domestic and foreign issues: (1) Regarding domestic affairs, Nehru emphasized that India's future independence and freedom must be built on peace. He urged Indians to immediately cease the riots, otherwise India's 400 million people would be doomed. In addition, Nehru acknowledged the severity of the domestic food shortage and called on Indians to work together to overcome the difficulties. (2) Regarding foreign affairs, Nehru praised the United States' efforts for peace and also expressed his desire to maintain friendly relations with the Soviet Union. Regarding the civil war in China, Nehru expressed concern and hoped that the conflict would be resolved soon.

### Northwest India Bombed

[Reuters, Peshawar, India, 6th] Known as the "Frontier Gandhi," the leader of the Northwest Frontier Province Congress Party, Ghaffar Khan, declared today: The tribal areas of Waziristan are also undergoing large-scale aerial bombardment. The reason for the strict secrecy is clear. On one hand, they extend a friendly hand to us and establish a national government in the center, while on the other hand, they create administrative difficulties for the central government. This is truly perplexing. Authorities in New Delhi stated: The bombing is to punish the natives in a part of Waziristan, and they were warned in advance to evacuate. Only two people were injured. The claim of a collective, large-scale bombardment is an overstatement.

Today's manuscript, the special correspondence "Going to Paris," will continue tomorrow.

Due to war damage to buildings and transportation, they have gradually moved to the former concessions. However, to restore the old appearance, it is necessary to first restore tram transportation in Nanshi."

### Supplementary Election of National Councilors in This City; Jin Zhenyu Has the Highest Popularity

[This Newspaper] According to central government regulations, National Councilors cannot concurrently serve as city councilors.

[This Newspaper] The Investigation Team has been in Shanghai for about two months and has received many confidential reports of cases. It has decided to actively process them. However, according to Committee Member Zhang, the actual number of cases handled is less than one-tenth of the total. Now, Team Leader Zhang Zhiben, Committee Member Zhang Qingzhen, and Committee Member Wu Wangji are scheduled to depart for Hangzhou by express train at 4:40 PM tomorrow to investigate the situation of the takeover in that area. The Railway Bureau has specially provided a comfortable private car to comfort the investigation envoys. It is reported that the Investigation Team is scheduled to hold a team affairs review meeting at the Supervision Office on Bixun Road at 7:00 PM tonight.

[Another report] Colonel Chen Yongqin of the Naval Fleet Command, who was recently confidentially reported, went to the Reception Investigation Team yesterday afternoon to visit Committee Member Zhang Qingzhen. Committee Member Zhang was not present, and Secretary Xu received him. Colonel Chen inquired about the name of the informant, but Secretary Xu refused.

### Investigation Team Inspects China Textile Industries

[This Newspaper] After arriving in Shanghai, the Investigation Team received many confidential letters related to the China Textile Industries (中紡). Team Leader Zhang Zhiben, Committee Member Wu Wangji, and Committee Member Zhang Qingzhen believe that to thoroughly investigate whether there is corruption in the China Textile Industries takeover, focusing on individual details will not lead to any results. To thoroughly understand the inside story, it is necessary to investigate the entire takeover situation of the China Textile Industries. Therefore, at 10:00 AM yesterday, they went to the general office of the China Textile Industries to visit General Manager Shu. According to him, all China Textile Industries factories were transferred to them by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. After the takeover, they actively reorganized the factories, which greatly contributed to stabilizing the prices of yarn and cloth on the market. The China Textile Industries takeover work can be summarized into three points: (1) The takeover work has been largely completed. A small number of factories have not yet been taken over due to disagreements with the processing bureau, so the inventory lists have not yet been completed. (2) A total of 3 million bolts of yarn and cloth have been taken over. 1.5 million bolts have been sorted out, 1 million bolts are still being sorted, and 500,000 bolts are awaiting inspection. (3) The China Textile Industries has slightly different opinions from the processing bureau regarding the return of some of the taken-over factories to their original owners.

The Investigation Team authorities believe that: (1) A list of taken-over factories and factories that have not yet been completely taken over should be prepared separately. (2) A table should be prepared and submitted regarding the bidding situation of the yarn and cloth. (3) A list should be prepared and submitted regarding the situation of the return of factories.

At 2:00 PM, Committee Members Wu and Zhang personally went to inspect the China Textile Industries' 19th Factory (formerly Gongda No. 1 Factory) and 17th Factory (formerly Yu Zong Factory). They were satisfied with the resumption of work. However, regarding whether there is corruption in the China Textile Industries takeover, Committee Member Zhang said that to thoroughly investigate, it would take at least a week to collect various types of files and inventory lists for detailed study to determine the situation.

### The Changchun Prisoner of War Camp Was Like Hell on Earth: Testimony from Two Witnesses in the Case of Japanese War Criminals Inuitsuka and Kawashima Regarding the Deaths of Twenty-Four American Prisoners Killed in Bombings

[Report from Our Newspaper] The testimonies of witnesses Harkins and Ganate regarding the case of Japanese war criminals Colonel Matsuda and Captain Kawashima, who abused American prisoners of war at the former Changchun prisoner of war camp, were heard yesterday morning. Harkins presented a photograph of the prisoner of war camp in court, pointing out that its location was only about 200 meters from a tram manufacturing factory. He had suggested building air raid shelters in the camp, but Matsuda refused. As a result, 24 American prisoners of war were killed in a bombing. Matsuda even forced the injured to write to the American command requesting that they stop bombing the area. However, the wounded American prisoners instead declared in the letter that they welcomed the US Air Force to continue bombing Changchun. The second witness, Ganate, was nearly blind, but he was still able to walk to the defendant's seat yesterday and, after carefully identifying Captain Kawashima, declared, "This is the captain!" Ganate went on to recount the circumstances at the time, saying that whenever he complained of an eye disease, Kawashima ignored him completely and refused to give him any medicine. On one occasion, he accused him of stealing alcohol and beat him with fists and feet and used water torture, so his head still feels unwell. The general conditions in the camp hospital at the time were even worse. After Kawashima left the camp every night, there were no medicines available, which caused many patients to become seriously ill and die.

### Tenant Commits Suicide, Landlord Moves the Body, Court Investigation Deems It Suspicious

[Report from Our Newspaper] Chen Xiyuan, a sub-landlord at No. 134 Tangfang Lane in the Nanshi area, sublet a room to Li Changfu (from Dongtai, over sixty years old), who lived alone. His son, Li Zirong, and his mother, Zhou, lived separately at No. 54 Jiangyin Street. Recently, Li Changfu suffered from illness. Medical treatment proved ineffective, and he harbored thoughts of ending his life. Around 4 AM the previous morning, he took a razor and slashed his throat, causing a cut about half an inch deep. He cried out in pain, which was heard downstairs. Chen Xiyuan, the sub-landlord, woke up from his deep sleep and went upstairs to investigate. He saw Li Changfu lying on the floor, already dead. Chen, feeling overwhelmed because of the death, carried the body out and hung it on a bamboo fence near Gaochangsi Temple, two or three houses away, with a rope around his neck. More than an hour later, a Zhou surname rickshaw puller went to the area to relieve himself and was horrified to see the body and shouted loudly. Neighbors gathered upon hearing the commotion. Someone who knew the deceased reported it to his son and notified the Penglai Police Station. Deputy Chiefs Yao Lu and Zheng ordered officers Wu Zhipeng, Wang Dianxiang, and Shan Zhendong to rush to the scene for investigation.

### Case of Embezzlement by Railway Staff: Some of the Stolen Goods Recovered

### China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Opens China-Philippines Route, Hai-Xia to Sail to Manila; Acquires Over One Hundred U.S. Ships in the Philippines

[Report from Our Newspaper] Since its resumption of business, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has expanded significantly with government assistance. The number of ships is more than three times that before the war, and the company is still continuously purchasing ships overseas. In May of this year, the company was instructed by the Executive Yuan to send Yan Zengfu to the Philippines to select and purchase U.S. surplus materials. After inspecting the Philippines for more than a month, Mr. Yan selected and purchased over a hundred ships of various sizes. Mr. Yan returned to Shanghai on the 6th and told reporters in the Bureau on the 7th about the situation in Nanyang and the dates the ships will arrive in Shanghai, saying: After the independence of the Philippines, the atmosphere is completely new, but because it was affected by the war, the fields are barren, and it is difficult to cultivate them for a while, which has greatly affected agricultural production. Therefore, materials are extremely scarce. At present, the most urgent needs are cotton products, electrical equipment, and porcelain. I sincerely hope that our country can transport and sell these goods. The Philippines produces a lot of wood, and many new sawmills have been established in the Philippines by Chinese. A considerable amount of wood has been transported to China. As for the purchase of American surplus ships, there are a total of 115 ships, including tugboats, iron barges, docks, cranes, and dredgers. Most of them are still under repair and will arrive in Shanghai one after another by the end of this year. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has assigned the Hai-Xia to operate the China-Philippines route. The Philippine side has entrusted China Development Company to act as its agent. The Filipino people welcome ships from our country. Philippine ships have already been traveling between Hong Kong and Xiamen and will soon come to Shanghai. It is known that there is little cargo transportation between Shanghai and the Philippines, because there are direct giant ships operated by American merchants, I am afraid that it cannot reach the ideal goal, so the Hai-Xia's route will mainly focus on various ports between Xiamen and the Philippines. Because most of the overseas Chinese are doing business between Xiamen and the Philippines. The ship has returned to Shanghai from Tianjin and may no longer sail north, it is preparing the formalities to sail to the Philippines.

### "Serving Society, Forging Oneself": Female Police Officers Are Not What They Used to Be - Young, Meticulous, and Rigorously Trained - Most Love Being Beautiful and Don't Like Wearing Uniforms

[Special Feature by Our Newspaper] The term "female police officer" seems to carry a somewhat discriminatory gaze from the general public. The origin of this discrimination stems from unfamiliarity and lack of understanding of this profession. Driven by curiosity, our reporter conducted an on-the-spot investigation of female police officers and gained a clearer picture of their history and current situation.

Shanghai had female police officers long before the War of Resistance. At that time, Cai Jingjun, the director of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, employed female police officers for the needs of searching female criminals and other tasks. These female police officers were different from the female police of the former Public Concession Police. Those female police officers, colloquially known as "female searchers," were mostly the wives or widows of police officers with extremely low levels of knowledge, and the public also looked down on them. They had no other tasks except standing at intersections and serving as searchers for women.

After the victory, the police bureau was determined to rectify and reform, and to alleviate the shortage of police officers and to meet the need for female police officers, it publicly recruited candidates. Applicants were required to have at least a junior high school education or equivalent academic ability. After being accepted, they had to undergo one month of training at the Yulin Road Police Training Center. All food and lodging expenses during the training period were provided by the government. Life in the center was very difficult, with everything being militarized, such as eating on the ground. At 5:45 AM every morning, everyone had to get up immediately when the horn sounded and finish washing up within fifteen minutes. At exactly 6:00 AM, everyone had to gather on the lawn for squad exercises. Half an hour later, the horn sounded again, and the flag-raising ceremony was held. All of these actions, including breakfast, had to be completed before 7:00 AM. Classes began at 7:00 AM, and the subjects studied were numerous, including violation of police regulations, criminal law abstracts, police ordinances, and police correspondence. In addition, handgun training and target practice were also included in the training. After one month, a graduation examination was held for three days. Those who passed were assigned to various departments and were required to remain employed for one year; otherwise, they would have to compensate the government for all losses incurred during the training period.

To date, there are over two hundred female police officers in Shanghai. They are all very young, averaging between fifteen and twenty-five years old. Most of them are assigned to internal affairs work, such as dance hall registration, household registration work, judicial interrogation records, and lost children care. Because women are generally more careful, their performance has been outstanding, and the public's perception has been renewed.

Their work assignments are subject to the orders of their superiors. Sometimes, they also have the opportunity to participate in external affairs work, such as catching "scroungers" on bridges and investigating "wild chickens" during the day. As a result, they have gained a deeper understanding of current society, especially the darker side of society.

Like all personnel in the police bureau, female police officers are required to wear uniforms. The summer uniform is a white shirt and black skirt. The winter uniform is exactly the same as the male police officers - long pants and cotton coats. They do not like to wear uniforms because they are all young, and young people always like to be beautiful.

Currently, their treatment is the same as that of first-class police officers, with a monthly salary of only 100,000 yuan. They inevitably complain about this meager salary, but this is an overall economic problem, and complaining alone is useless. Fortunately, they have no burdens, and they have a great interest in their daily work. They say: "Being a female police officer allows us to serve society on the one hand and forge ourselves on the other!"

### National Chongqing Normal School's Opening Date Uncertain

Hundreds of Students Anxious and Worried

[Report from Our Newspaper in Chongqing] The Ministry of Education decided before the summer to hand over Beibei National Chongqing Normal School to the provincial government. For several months, the provincial government has not sent anyone to take over. The original teachers have also returned east. Currently, the school is in a state of anarchy. Students who have not yet graduated see other schools starting classes one after another, while they themselves are at a loss. On the one hand, the mother school's opening date is uncertain, and on the other hand, even if they want to transfer to another school, the normal schools in Sichuan Province are full and will not accept them. They cannot serve in elementary schools because they do not meet the qualifications, which is also impossible. Hundreds of students are anxious day and night, with furrowed brows. Alumni of the school left in Chongqing have witnessed this and are heartbroken, and they are appealing to all parties to urge the government to pay attention and not let young people waste their studies, causing damage to the country's vitality.

### Serious Problem of Too Few Schools and Too Many Students: Minister Zhu and Wang Jing Report to the Chairman, Vice Minister Hang Flies to Guling on the 5th, Vice Minister Zhu Returns to Nanjing on the Same Day

[Report from Our Newspaper in Nanjing] Minister of Education Zhu Jiahao and Vice Minister Zhu Jingnong went to Guling to attend the Youth Corps Conference (the Minister of Zhu is a standing director, and the Deputy Minister is a supervisor), and because there is a lack of transportation for the return of inland schools, and in the capital and other places, because the school building has problems due to school recovery, and the serious problem of too few schools and too many students, they feel that the original plan to implement education at all levels cannot be implemented. Prices are soaring, affecting the predetermined budget, resulting in a huge shortage of educational expenses. They reported the various situations to Chairman Jiang and asked for relief. Vice Minister of Education Hang Liwu also flew to Guling from Nanjing on the 5th because he was a member of the Youth Corps. Vice Minister Zhu returned to Nanjing on the afternoon of the 5th to handle departmental affairs. Our newspaper reporter visited Vice Minister Zhu on the 6th, and he said: How to solve the education matters after reporting to Chairman Jiang must wait until Minister Zhu returns to Nanjing to learn the details. Minister Zhu paid respects to the Chairman on the 5th, and must wait until after the Youth Corps Conference on the 8th, or even until the closing of the meeting to return to Nanjing, so the earliest is about the 10th or so. The main points of discussion of the Youth Corps, whether its function belongs to education or politics, and whether it belongs to the party's scope or outside the party's scope, are being studied and discussed and have not yet been decided. Minister asked Chairman Jiang about the matter of no school to accommodate them, and he will have to discuss the matter with President Song in person. In addition, various schools in the rear have not yet returned because the recent continuation of food requisition and transportation continues to affect them and it is difficult to proceed. The Ministry of Education has suggested that one or two ships be designated exclusively for school repatriation travel, but it is not known whether this hope can be achieved.

[Another News] The Ministry of Education is now petitioning the Executive Yuan to quickly order the agencies occupying school buildings to relocate so that schools can be reopened and students can avoid losing their studies. All schools this semester feel overcrowded and cannot be accommodated. According to Vice Minister Zhu Jingnong, the main reason is that many students from the Chongqing occupied area are admitted, plus the demobilization of the Youth Army, the distribution of the Lin University internship class, the enrollment of preparatory classes, the return of students from the rear, and the transfer of translators, etc., which has created a phenomenon of too few schools and too many students. The Ministry is planning to remedy the situation in many ways.

### Yarn Merchants Still Tend Towards Spot Goods, Distribution of Yarn Focuses on Industrial Sector, Textile Construction Office's Industrial Survey Serves as Basis, Yarn Number Applicants Yesterday All Had Orders Returned

Yesterday, the yarn market became even more stable. Demand from the Changjiang gang turned strong, with healthy appetites. Regardless of whether the yarn count was from large factories or small ones, prices uniformly rose by 30,000 to 40,000. The Special Double Horse closing price also rose to 1.57 million. Confidence was strong, with everyone embracing the spot goods doctrine. They were not interested in the 400-pound standard yarn counts allocated by major yarn factories. Those in the industry who had been approved for allocation felt greatly troubled. This type of warehouse receipt would take at least ten days to convert into spot goods. Lanfeng and Riguang of the Textile Construction Office remained at 1.35 to 1.36 million. The market believed that the export of Cengwei cloth would soon be opened, so confidence was unanimously rising. Furthermore, yesterday when the Textile Construction Office opened yarn supplies, it allocated 20 counts to factories such as underwear knitting, and 32 counts to dyeing and weaving factories. All yarn number applicants had their orders returned. From this, it can be seen that the Textile Construction Office's plan to first allocate goods to production industries has already begun to be implemented.

It is heard that in order to understand the actual production situation of various registered manufacturers, the company has begun to conduct industrial surveys, starting with the machine dyeing and weaving industry and the knitting industry, and then extending to industries such as underwear, handkerchiefs, canvas, and electrical weaving. Statistics will be compiled in the future to serve as a reference for supporting overall production. The survey items include factory name, factory address, registration number with the Ministry of Economic Affairs or the Bureau of Social Affairs, Textile Construction Office registration number, organizational nature, registered trademark, number of workers, wages, factory building, business operations, product sales, raw material requirements, production quantity, current raw materials, machinery equipment, and operating conditions. According to Specialist Shi Xinquan of the company, as of the end of August, over 4,000 manufacturers had applied to the company for registration to purchase allocated goods. Among them, in addition to yarn number and cloth number industries, the machine dyeing and weaving industry has the most production industries, followed by the knitting industry and the electrical weaving industry, while the underwear, handkerchief, and canvas industries are fewer. In the future, based on the survey results, the company will determine how to organize and classify them according to actual production and equipment conditions, and analyze them separately. If necessary, it will cooperate with the Bureau of Social Affairs to promote an industrial census. However, this survey is limited to registered manufacturers. If there are any registered manufacturers who have not received the survey form, they can directly collect it from the survey section of the company's business department.

Embargo on Hua Nan Already Officially Ordered

It is learned that the Customs has formally received an order from the Executive Yuan yesterday, banning the export of cotton yarn to Guangdong and Fujian. Furthermore, according to officials of the Textile Construction Company, recent orders for cotton yarn from the Guangdong gang have sharply decreased.

[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] It is heard that the Executive Yuan has recently decided to ban the transport of cotton yarn and cloth to Guangdong and Fujian to prevent smuggling to Southeast Asia and to stimulate domestic cloth prices. At the same time, it has been decided that if there is a shortage of cloth in various parts of Hua Nan, the government will be responsible for the supply, with legitimate manufacturers as the allocation targets. It is also heard that this measure is temporary in nature, and will be considered for cancellation once the domestic supply of cloth is abundant.

### Strong Buying Interest from Banks, Bond Market Pulled Up Again

Although residual liquidation of public bonds has not stopped, buying interest from banks has not slackened. The supply on the market has gradually become exhausted. In addition, short covering was initiated, and the situation turned positive. Unified C opened in the morning at 1,820 yuan and was immediately oversubscribed, gradually rising to 2,360 yuan before some high-level selling caused a slight pullback. As a result, it closed up 500 yuan compared to the previous close. A and B rose 280 yuan, D rose 300 yuan, and Unified E also improved by 450 yuan.

### Securities Auction Scheduled, Chinese Stocks Gradually Improving

Chinese stocks shifted from stable to firm. Yongsha and Shengkai opened and saw 645 yuan, Meiya 3,950 yuan, Jingfu 2,450 yuan, Xinguang 2,75 yuan, and Qinxing 190 yuan. Later, because unpopular small and medium-sized stocks only advanced and did not retreat, coupled with the resumption of securities trading within the day, buyers were not affected and gradually improved. Around noon, they all saw high prices, with a slight pullback near closing. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yongsha, Meiya, Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing each rose by half to one tenth, and the less popular small and medium-sized stocks also improved by half to one tenth. Veteran stocks also made progress, and the over-the-counter market continued to rise after closing.

The situation for foreign stocks remained the same as the previous day. Chinese merchants continued to cut losses, while foreign merchants rushed to purchase, gradually stabilizing. However, after reaching high levels, the market consolidated. Yisha once rose to the 10,000 yuan mark, and British Union rose to 11,700 yuan, but fell to 11,300 yuan, finally stabilizing. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yisha Paper, Yisha Beer, and Steel slightly rose, British Union Asia improved by half a tenth, and Huidemen and Guangping were flat.

The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs will each send one supervisor. It is heard that the supervisor appointed by the Ministry of Finance is Wang Aotang, and the official order arrived at the exchange yesterday.

### Money Market Generally Looser, Gold and Currency Both Seen with Good Profits, Banks and Shops to Adjust Business Hours Starting Tomorrow

The Municipal Banking, Money, and Trust Industry Associations jointly issued an announcement yesterday, stating that the daily business hours for September have been set and announced. Now, in order to facilitate daily settlements for customers, it has been jointly resolved that, starting from September 9th, the business hours will be the same as those of the Nanjing banking industry association, and the previously announced business hours will be adjusted as follows: Monday to Friday, 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM (no interruption for lunch), Saturday 9:00 AM to 1:00 PM.

Because the money market was generally looser yesterday, there were more compensators, suddenly turning profitable. Opening in the morning at 2.069 million, it gradually improved from 2.068 million. However, there was still a lack of special changes at first, so after 10 AM, the Central Bank still allocated 48 bars at a price of 2.0725 million. Afterwards, the US dollar turned firm, boosting sentiment considerably, and repeatedly raised prices. Although the Central Bank had supply, the attitude of raising prices resurfaced, so confidence became even firmer. At noon, it broke through the 2.1 million mark, seeing highs of 2.12 million. In the afternoon, because there were no special changes on Saturday, it finally closed up 47,000 compared to the previous close. The exchange rate with the US dollar narrowed to 613 yuan per tael. Decorated gold was 22,500, and silver ingots and silver dollars were flat. The dark interest rate was around 1.5 jiao, and outside the market, it still required 6 jiao.

Foreign currencies, due to rumors of a reduction and long non-convertibility, suddenly saw rumors of profit-taking yesterday, and buying interest was exceptionally strong, repeatedly rising. Starting from around 3,310 yuan in the early morning, it was immediately surrounded by buyers, gradually becoming stable, then firm, then even firmer. Around noon, it had already broken through the 3,400 yuan mark, approaching 3,430 yuan at noon. It slightly advanced in the afternoon, and finally closed up 120 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong tickets were initially weak but then firm, and also rose by 15 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate rose to 152 yuan due to urgent demand from the Guangdong gang for Shanghai electricity. On the market, it fell to below 670 yuan, and finally closed at 680 yuan to 690 yuan. The Indian exchange rate was 820 yuan, and the British exchange rate was 11,000 yuan with demand. The US exchange rate was around the listed price.

### Guangda Huahang Arrives with Large Batch of Soviet Newspapers

[Report from this newspaper] A large quantity of Russian paper has arrived in Shanghai again. The Enzhili (transliteration) number, managed by the Shunheng Foreign Firm, arrived at the port the day before yesterday, shipped from the port of Uglich, with over 3,250 tons of newspaper, drawing paper, and wood paper, totaling 14,115 pieces. It is currently being unloaded at pontoons number 24 and 25. The Russian paper was purchased and transported exclusively by Guangda Huahang.

### China Sand White Rises by 10,000 Yuan

Yesterday, only China Sand White rose on the sugar market, rising by 10,000 yuan. The rest were flat.

### Rayon Allocation Too Small, Black Market Gradually Rises

Yesterday, rayon, because the Textile Construction Office allocated it to silk weaving factories every other day, was limited, with each factory receiving only one box, or even just half a box, causing the black market to rise. 120 Bridge with light, Sheng called 600,000 yuan, then rose 50,000 yuan, and in a blink of an eye it rose to 700,000 yuan. In the afternoon, it called for an even higher 50,000 yuan. Miscellaneous brands of 120 with light were around 700,000 yuan, a large increase of 140,000 to 150,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Semi-gloss and 150 with light saw an even greater increase, more than 200,000 yuan higher than the day before. However, because the price increase was too high, buyers held back, and there were few transactions. Although factory managers had transactions, the prices remained unchanged. Silk goods, Meiya bed covers, called for 800,000 yuan, but there were no transactions. The formal price was approximately a maximum of 800,000 yuan. All other goods were showing firmness. Transactions in flourishing goods were rarer, and the opening prices increased by 1,000 yuan.

### Smoke, White Coal are Firm and Active, Incoming Volume is Low, Quota Sufficient

The arrival of white coal chunks in the coal market is still limited because exports from Tianjin still need to be approved by the Shanghai District Fuel Management Committee. Although transactions in white coal chunks are also quiet, the owners are keeping the spot goods, so white coal chunks have been firm in recent days. Due to the fuel committee's allocation limit to coal merchants and the United Business Office of Coal, the amount allocated for the first half of this month will be sufficient, so the United Business Office has also said that it will temporarily suspend allocation, and the market is becoming more active.

### Recent Buying Price of Japanese Silk: Lowest 5.55 Dollars

[United Press, Washington, 6th] According to the US government agency Construction Finance Corporation, the prices paid by merchants who recently purchased 2,260 bales of Japanese raw silk were a minimum of $5.55 per pound and a maximum of $16 per pound.

### Household Sugar to be Implemented on Schedule, Company Decides to Distribute as Much as Possible to Eliminate Black Market, Those Who Have Applied in Other Locations Will Still Be Distributed Some

Since the distribution method of sugar in this city was improved, the rising trend has been suppressed, and it has turned downward. According to the person in charge of Taiwan Sugar Company, the sugar market can become stable. The company's supply is constantly arriving. If sugar prices fluctuate again, the company can directly sell, regardless of any sacrifice, to achieve the purpose of leveling prices. In the future, the company's distribution will target members of the Sugar Merchants Association. Both local and foreign locations will be wholesale by sugar merchants, and members of the South Goods industry will be specifically responsible for handling the task of affordable sugar. As for sugar sales by household, it will be implemented starting from the 13th period. The 12th period will close for registration on the 7th, and the 13th period will start registering from next Saturday, that is, handling the distribution of sugar purchases, implementing the purchase of sugar with certificates. The previous plan was to allow each person to purchase sugar twice a month with certificates, half a catty each time, but it has now been decided to change it to once, one catty each time. The quantity of sugar sold by retail stores will be based on the sugar purchase certificates received as the basis for verification. With the implementation of this method, citizens can indeed benefit practically, and retailers cannot easily transfer it to the black market in order to seek profiteering.

### Applications from Other Locations Transferred to Taiwan Sugar for Discretionary Distribution

The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs previously believed that the difference between the approved distribution price of sugar and the black market price of sugar was too large, resulting in very large malpractices. It convened the Sugar Price Review Committee to re-deliberate the price, calculating China Sand at 140,000 yuan and Raw Sand at 130,000 yuan. Because the price of sugar has already changed, all applications for sugar distribution from the Sugar Industry Association of this port and other locations have become invalid and should be re-applied. This was passed by the meeting and recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is now heard that sugar merchants from other locations, such as Ning Zichun, suffered losses due to the change in methods, and applied to the Bureau of Social Affairs to withdraw the order. The bureau, considering that the claims were factual, agreed to request the Taiwan Sugar Company for review. The original application and attachments for the distribution of Taiwan Sugar for the 12th period from sugar merchants and cooperatives in other locations were transferred to the company for processing. Regarding the sugar price, it should still be paid according to the agreed price.

### Tallow Oil Prices Rise Unstoppably, Hankou Goods Are of Little Help, Eastern Zhejiang Stocks Are Mostly Gone

[Report from this newspaper] Tallow oil, because it is the Mid-Autumn Festival, and candles are in high demand, and because of the hot weather, it is inconvenient to transport, and the source has decreased, the selling price is gradually increasing. Various companies have almost no goods to meet the market demand. There are not many stocks in the production area of Eastern Zhejiang, so the goods arriving in Hangzhou are dilapidated. Only the goods from Jingzhou Macheng and other places in Hankou are still arriving in succession, but it takes a lot of time to transfer them to Shanghai. The so-called distant water cannot quench a nearby fire. Although various companies in this port have managed to obtain some, not many have arrived, and the selling prices have gradually increased. Hebei Tallow is 150,000 yuan, Neiping is 140,000 yuan, Du Chui is 136,000 yuan, Longjian is 132,000 yuan, De Gan oil is 128,000 yuan, and Macheng oil is 120,000 yuan.

### Export Tax Was Indeed Abolished Yesterday, Yang, Assistant to the Customs Chief, Reiterates

[Report from this newspaper] The news that this city will be exempt from export tax starting yesterday was recorded in yesterday's newspaper. The reporter visited Yang, assistant to the export supervisor of the Jianghai Customs, again yesterday. He said that the Jianghai Customs had indeed received instructions from the Inspector General of Customs yesterday, ordering the immediate exemption of export tax. Therefore, from yesterday onwards, the Jianghai Customs will no longer collect export tax at all.

### Simultaneous Promotion of Domestic and Foreign Sales, Tea Prices Continue to Show Good Color

As the Mid-Autumn Festival approaches, tea shops in this street see frequent increases in door-to-door sales, so demand has not decreased. At the same time, collection in the Suzhou and Wuxi areas is also very keen. As for the foreign firm tea market, export firms are still rushing to catch shipping schedules, and inquiries are exceptionally good. Therefore, transactions are exceptionally exciting under the buying enthusiasm. Selling prices continue to show good color, and small-leaf black tea still has a trend of being sold as soon as it is seen. In addition, new Bai Lin black tea is also favored by many. According to industry insiders, Qianlai Leaf Tea Company is willing to accept all new Bai Lin black tea that comes to them. However, it is heard that production of this type of flower has already stopped in the production area, so the stock is decreasing day by day. Looking ahead, there is still hope for repeated high prices.

### Rise in Chinese Medicine Slightly

Recently, due to the large purchases from Taiwan and Guangdong, the trend of Chinese medicine has been towards high prices. Now, because the buying appetite has waned and funds are tight at the edge of the festival, all parties are taking a wait-and-see approach, so the rising trend has subsided, and transactions are also quiet.

### Liu An and Teak Soar

In the timber market, in recent days, foreign pine and fir have been unable to rise because the source continues to arrive. Finishing materials such as Liu An and Teak have not arrived for a long time, and the stock is getting thinner, so sellers are hoarding, and prices are rising sharply. Liu An plywood prices are also active.

### Grain Review Committee Raises Rice Prices, Oil Market Digests Actively and Market Prices Continue to Rise

The rice market saw very keen sales from the store side, and the review price was also slightly increased by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. The market trend was still stable with supply and demand. Indica and Japonica both rose by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, but the closing price was soft, forming a state of early firmness and late slackness. New Yin Yuan has slightly arrived, and the price is fair and stable. Chen Bai Yuan also followed suit and turned less. The supply and demand of flour were both balanced. The 17th rice price review meeting decided that the rice price would change slightly, calculating the price of white Japonica rice at 60,000 yuan, and the door sale price at 65,500 yuan, an increase of over 3% compared to before. Foreign Indica, community Indica, were 54,000 yuan, and the door sale price was 59,000 yuan, the same as before. Bu Yi Indica was 47,000 yuan, and the door sale price was 51,500 yuan, unchanged. Milled Indica was 43,000 yuan, and the door sale price was 47,000 yuan, an increase of over 2%. White Indica was 39,600 yuan, and the door sale price was 43,000, a decrease of slightly less than 5% compared to before. The sales of Saigon rice were weak, and the selling price remained at 43,000 yuan. The buying appetite for wheat in Fujian and Ningbo was strong, and the arrival of goods was scarce, so sellers were firm, and the price rose by 600 to 700 yuan. The sale of Northern white wheat was not smooth, and there were not many transactions, but it was pulled up by yellow wheat by 300 to 500 yuan. The buying appetite of soybean oil merchants was better, and the tired surface rejuvenated, rising by more than 100 yuan in the interval. Although the source of broad beans was not as prosperous as the previous one, the digestion was not strong, and it still fell by 300 to 500 yuan. There were slight inquiries about corn in Qingdao, and the decline stopped and rose, adding 1,000 yuan. The oil market was flourishing and active, with arrivals not matching digestion. Raw oil and soybean oil both added 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, and tea oil also rose by 1,000 yuan. Clear oil appetite was dull and flat. Soybean cake still tended to move downstream.

### Opening Remarks

— Wu Kuo-cheng

Our city is one of the world's six largest metropolises, yet its traffic situation is far from comparable to that of other cities. This is because in the past, the city's administrative bodies did not coordinate with each other, and the concessions, in particular, had no pre-planned arrangements, allowing everything to develop naturally. As a result, the city's road system is unclear, the widths are uneven, and to this day, it cannot meet the actual needs of vehicular traffic. Moreover, having suffered extreme devastation from the enemy and puppet regimes during the war, there is an unusual shortage of public transportation, forcing citizens to rely on tricycles and rickshaws as their means of transportation. The size of a tricycle is almost equivalent to two rickshaws, and their number has now reached over 15,000, which was unheard of before the war. Furthermore, most of the areas of southern Shanghai and Zhabei were destroyed in the war, and commercial and industrial activities have shifted towards the central district, leading to a concentration of all kinds of vehicles. All of these factors are the main reasons for the particularly congested traffic in the central district today.

The municipal government has already decided on measures to improve traffic order in the central district, which will be implemented starting tomorrow. The main points are to facilitate traffic flow and to impose restrictions; that is, based on traffic needs and road widths, to designate two lanes each for one-way traffic, and to specify the roads and times for different types of vehicles to pass or be prohibited from passing. Because the city's vehicles range from single-wheeled carts and two-wheeled rickshaws to three-wheeled bicycles and ten-wheeled trucks, the variety is extremely diverse. With countless vehicles of different sizes, speeds, and types competing for the same roads, it is no wonder that good traffic order cannot be maintained. Therefore, by implementing one-way traffic and lane separation methods, facilitating traffic flow, and imposing restrictions, it is hoped to improve the situation and achieve the goals of "order first" and "safety first."

The success of any undertaking depends on the close cooperation between the government and the people. If the government has no measures, the blame lies with the government; if the government has established measures, but the people do not actively assist and jointly implement them, the blame lies with the people. Regarding the city's traffic problem, public opinion often regards the ability to improve it as a litmus test for the municipal government. It is the duty of the municipal government to do its utmost. Now that measures to improve traffic in the central district have been formulated and implemented based on the actual situation, the extent to which citizens can comply with them will also serve as a litmus test for their cooperation. It is hoped that all vehicle drivers and all citizens will understand this and assist in the implementation, so that the city's traffic order can be on par with that of major cities around the world. This is my sincere hope.

Movies and Drama

### Scripts and Audiences

— Tao Xiong

It is ideal for a script to be well-received by the audience when it is performed on stage. However, many scripts do not achieve this ideal outcome. This is not the fault of the audience, nor is it the fault of the scriptwriter. The reason is that different levels of knowledge result in different targets and different preferences.

I remember when Tolstoy's famous work, "The Power of Darkness," was performed at the Drama Academy, I heard different reactions from the audience.

The play is about a young peasant who is driven by dark forces to commit two wrongdoings: one is having an illegitimate child with his master's daughter, and before her family finds out, the young peasant buries the illegitimate child alive. The other is that he engages in ambiguous behavior with his master's young wife, which results in the master being angered to death. He eventually becomes the head of the family. That's roughly the story, but the "power of darkness" contained in the script can be felt at any time and any place. The playwright's purpose in writing this script was to tell the audience that all the sins were not the sins of the young peasant himself, but the sins of this "power of darkness." So, what exactly is this "power of darkness"? It is not explicitly stated in the script, but rather left for the audience to experience and feel for themselves.

Tolstoy has a pair of sharp eyes and a sharp pen. He saw the power that others could not see and wrote it down. This is something that is beneficial to young men and women. He calls on young men and women not to be shrouded by this "power of darkness." He tells them: This is a sinful thing. But how many people can accept this great revelation?

When this play was performed at the Jiang'an Drama Academy in Sichuan, the different reactions I heard were:

A middle school student said: This is really an unpleasant thing!

A wounded soldier said: This kid is so comfortable!

A gentleman-like person said: Are these even considered human beings?

A middle-aged woman kept exclaiming: Sinful, sinful!

From the mouths of these people, we know that they have accepted different things from the play. They cannot necessarily accept what the playwright wants to give. This is, of course, a necessary phenomenon at different levels of knowledge!

We certainly know that the audience in the stadium is entirely made up of sports fans, and people who don't like sports won't go to the stadium. People who go to dance halls must be interested in dancing, and those who are not interested will lose their enthusiasm after going once or twice. But the theater is different: people from all social strata can go to the theater to watch a play with an attitude of entertainment, using their own levels of knowledge to measure everything in the play, and using their own preferences and interests to accept the things in the play. This is the freedom of the audience, and playwrights cannot restrict them or force them to accept certain parts of the play. However, a playwright can identify the target audience for his work before writing the play, which may allow all audience members to gain a common understanding of what the playwright wants to convey.

Audiences in the theater have long been divided into three categories: one is the philosopher with a calm mind who seeks the truth in the play with reason. One is the easily moved old lady. The other is the young man who comes with an attitude of entertainment and cheers at random. These three types of people encompass all the audience members in the theater. If a play's performance can be liked by all three types of people, then it is a successful script.

The recent drama performances in Shanghai, without considering the artistic level for the time being, are always losing money in terms of business. The poor business is due to the small number of audience members; the small number of audience members also means that the play cannot be accepted by the audience. This proves that the performance of the play can only satisfy a certain class or a certain type of audience. Other audience members do not feel satisfied, so they do not enter the theater, which affects the theater company's losses, leading to the dissolution of the theater company!

In the past half year, summarizing the achievements and results of each performance, we can roughly know that the Shanghai audience likes extreme stimulation: they are more likely to accept sentimental dramas that make them cry or comedies that make them laugh at any time. They may not like scripts that fall between the two extremes and are neither crying nor laughing. Especially things that are high-level, serious, and truly works of art. Of course, this does not mean that the entire audience cannot accept them, but rather that only people with a high level of knowledge can accept them, that is to say, only one of the three types of audience members in the theater can accept this kind of true work of art.

For example, "The Return of Spring to the Earth" performed by the China Electric Theater Troupe and "Spring Cold" performed recently by the Shanghai Experimental Theater Society are both works of art that exceed the standard, but they both lost money. This surprised us theater workers. Why did such good dramas suffer such a tragic fate? This illustrates the interests and preferences of the majority of the Shanghai audience. At the same time, it tells the theater company负责人 that when selecting scripts to perform, if you are not prepared to lose money, you must clearly understand his target audience!

### "Desert Love Song" and "Hollywood Canteen"

— Xin Wu

Warner Bros. has produced a grand war-effort film, "Hollywood Canteen," featuring female stars such as Bette Davis, Joan Crawford, Joan Leslie, Barbara Stanwyck, Ida Lupino, and the Andrews Sisters. The male stars include Dennis Morgan, Eddie Cantor, Joe E. Brown, Jack Benny, Paul Henreid, and John Garfield, as well as the famous Vaughn Monroe Orchestra. This astounding lineup is unprecedented and breathtaking. The film is over two hours long. Warner Bros. has always been praised by audiences for its conscientious film production and avoidance of shoddy work, such as the literary films "Casablanca" and "The Watch on the Rhine," and the war film "Objective, Burma!", each of which has satisfied us.

"Hollywood Canteen" was shown at the Golden Gate Theater yesterday morning to entertain new figures in the community. Today, "Desert Song," a Technicolor film, will be shown at the Cathay Theater at 10:00 AM to entertain figures in the news and culture circles. The film was selected by Warner Bros. to celebrate the 20th anniversary of talking films.

### Tales of Nightingale Flying in the World

— Qin

A rainy night, the theater was packed. On the music stage, Russ conducted the orchestra, and Nightingale sang on stage. But outside the theater door, a young man with a violin stared at the huge ticket prices plastered on the poster.

Nightingale, she is now a highly acclaimed singer. Many gentlemen and celebrities want to win her favor, but she detests these people and always tries to avoid them. That evening, she came out of the theater and happened to meet Ren Yun, a poor young musician. Ren Yun went to Nightingale's home and asked her to sing a song for him, Nightingale agreed.

At Ren Yun's home, he and a large group of workers were about to begin playing music. He publicly announced that Nightingale had sung for him, but no one believed him. As a result, Ren Yun's old friend Liu Qi suggested that he invite Nightingale to participate in the big program on Saturday night, Ren Yun agreed. Thereupon, the performance began.

Russ was Nightingale's teacher, an outdated old musician. He opposed Nightingale's association with the unknown Ren Yun, but Nightingale did not think so.

Ren Yun wrote a letter to Nightingale, inviting her to participate in their concert on Saturday night.

Saturday arrived, Ren Yun and Liu Qi were busy tidying up the house. Nightingale also rushed from the theater, everyone sang and played happily, the audience listened attentively. After a song was finished, it was greatly welcomed by the audience. Nightingale thanked them and bid farewell to go home. Ren Yun accompanied her on the road. Nightingale expressed her wish: she hoped to use her singing to give spiritual love to the public, she wanted to sing to everyone, to the broad masses. Ren Yun also believed that art should be for the masses, not the exclusive property of a few people. Nor should it be treated as a commodity for sale!

Nightingale returned home, Russ rebuked her and told her to break off contact with Ren Yun.

The next day, Nightingale had a dispute with Russ over the fact that ticket prices would be raised again next month. Nightingale said, "My singing is art, art that the public needs, not a commodity!"

Ren Yun and Liu Qi planned to organize an orchestra to perform in many places without music. They wanted to invite Nightingale to join. So, Ren Yun went to Nightingale's house to propose this idea to her. Unexpectedly, Russ bumped into him and scolded Ren Yun out!

One day, Liu Qi brought a radio home, and many neighborhood children came to listen. Lily, who lived downstairs, also squeezed in, but accidentally, she was squeezed out of the crowd and rolled downstairs. Lily was sent to the hospital, and Nightingale paid all the medical expenses. In addition, she gave Ren Yun 500,000 yuan as funding for organizing the orchestra, and promised to participate in their concert.

Nightingale joined the orchestra organized by Ren Yun, using the name Yang Yun, and followed the orchestra to perform in various working-class areas, which was very popular!

The next day, a news item was published in the newspaper: "Ms. Yang Yun comforts the common people." Russ saw it and strongly opposed it in front of Nightingale, he said: "If Yang Yun is my student, I will never allow her to do this!"

Russ, in order to sever the relationship between Ren Yun and Nightingale, personally went to Ren Yun's house and told Ren Yun about his relationship with Nightingale, asking Ren Yun to stop approaching Nightingale. But Ren Yun said: "Miss Nightingale is an adult, she has her own will, does Mr. Russ have any way to control her ideas?" Russ had nothing to say and went home in dismay. He proposed to Nightingale, Nightingale never expected that her teacher would propose to her. She was a little at a loss and said emotionally, "I will never leave you!"

The notice at the entrance of the theater read "Internal repairs, performances temporarily suspended." Ren Yun came out of it dejectedly. Later, Liu Qi learned from Nightingale's servant that Nightingale and Russ had gone to the countryside. Ren Yun recklessly went to the countryside to find her.

In the countryside, Ren Yun found Nightingale. The two reunited after a long separation, and their affection grew even stronger. They agreed to perform once again before New Year's Day. Nightingale decided to find a way to rush back to Shanghai before New Year's Day.

New Year's Day, in a large open square. This concert was performed again. Nightingale participated in the singing. Coincidentally, Feng Menghua, the chief writer of a tabloid, passed by. As a result, this new discovery was published in the newspaper with a large headline: "Yang Yun is Nightingale." Once the news spread, the number of audience members in Nightingale's theater decreased. Because those gentlemen thought that Nightingale's songs could be heard for free, what was so special about them? Nightingale told Russ her theme, she said: "Music is something that the public loves, a food that everyone needs, why can't it be enjoyed by everyone like sunshine and water? Those gentlemen only have money in their eyes, they use money to evaluate everything, what art do they understand, they are simply insulting art!" But Russ, after listening to her words, was not only unmoved, but instead drove her out. Nightingale went to Ren Yun. Ren Yun encouraged her and told her not to be afraid of anything and to go for it!

After that, Nightingale declared to the people that she would wander around to promote her aspirations! The love between Ren Yun and her grew day by day, and they finally got married. But they still sang and performed everywhere, whether in orphanages or nursing homes, there were their footprints.

Days passed, and the love they gave to people grew wider and wider. Everywhere people welcomed them, commemorated them, they were the true artists!

### Ouyang Fei Ying in "Nightingale Flying in the World"

### Weekly Movie Review

— Zhu Xi

This week, the best-selling movie is "Bathing Beauty". Although it has been released twice, it is still very popular. However, the domestic film "Zhong Yi Zhi Jia" (Family of Loyalty and Righteousness) is not weaker than the former.

Zhong Yi Zhi Jia (Family of Loyalty and Righteousness)

In the play, after the victory, amid Liu Qiong's eloquent remarks, shadows of various scenes move away one after another, which seems better than the ending.

Bathing Beauty

In terms of the overall technique and structure, this film is considered successful. If we use this analytical view; "watching the colorful scenes, Red Skelton's slapstick, and Esther Williams' swimming," then this film is an excellent film. The music is excellently matched, better than the formal performances in the film.

Minor irrationalities are allowed in comedies, but the film first describes how difficult it is for men to enter a women's school, but later, men inexplicably climb into Red Skelton's bedroom through the windows one after another, which is self-contradictory.

Bambi

Walt Disney's cartoon is unique. It does not have bright colors, and tries to be as close to nature as possible; the rain scenes and snow scenes are very well drawn, and the music accompaniment is even better than that of "Bathing Beauty".

If the ending could be changed to Bambi gradually aging, that would be better than the current succession to the position of stag king, and it is not necessary to change the picture.

Destination Tokyo

Cary Grant is calm and powerful. The underwater bomb section is the most exciting, and the appendectomy section. It seems isolated; if it is said to be a symbol of removing obstacles, it is better to use another method, and this statement is extremely far-fetched. In the culturally advanced United States, how can medicine be so childish? There is no military doctor in the boat?

However, this film is considered good among naval films.

Lady on a Train

The three interludes are very far-fetched. The camera tries its best to flatter Deanna Durbin, and at the same time, there are many close-up shots. The story, except for the interludes of singing, is not bad.

Among the actors, Edward Everett Horton is very good, and Deanna Durbin is just adequate, not as good as "Hers to Hold". But it is better than "Something for the Boys", "Can't Help Singing" and other films.

The Kid from Texas

The most general criticism is that this film is better than "The Outlaw". The arrangement of a barber and news reporter character is the most interesting.

Constance Bennett is old, and Broderick Crawford and Warren William are adequate.

The additional short films are excellent. They are all old Hollywood song and dance scenes. Among them, the swimming pool section, if color is added, will not lose to "Bathing Beauty."

The Bandit of Sherwood Forest

The final sword fight is wonderful; the jewelry selling in the front section is good, but the section before that is not good.

Actors

There are really few good actors this week. Cary Grant, who was originally ranked third last week, can be promoted to first this week.

(1) Cary Grant (in "Destination Tokyo")

(2) Red Skelton (in "Bathing Beauty")

(3) Owl and Rabbit (in "Bambi")

Outstanding ones are worth mentioning here.

Chun Qiu (Spring and Autumn)

### The Sound of Insects on an Autumn Night

— Zhong Yuan

Do you like to listen to the sound of insects on an autumn night?

I think the sound of insects on an autumn night is like a group of skilled and lovely little musicians holding a lively ensemble on the empty wilderness.

Cast aside your sorrows, close your heart, put all the worldly affairs in the vastness of the sky, leaving only a hazy soul, immersed in a clear realm like water. At that time, you will never gnash your teeth and hate your enemies; nor will you use a fine pen to write any boring verses; nor will you be indignant or shed tears. You will only smile slightly, letting memory bloom in the music of "squeak... squeak..."

If you are a gentleman with a beard, you will still remember the green grass, wildflowers, mud mounds, stones, and good companions riding on the backs of cows in the suburbs. …

If you are a gray-haired lady, you will still remember the bright moon in the courtyard, your sister's smile, and your mother's gentle lullaby. …

As for me? Let me tell you, I will still remember those kinds of hazy stories:

Once upon a time, there was a lazy poor woman. Every day her husband asked her to weave cloth, but she always secretly hid the yarn and didn't weave at all. Later, one day her husband fell ill and asked her to take the woven cloth out to sell it for rice. She couldn't produce it. Her husband was so angry that he killed her with a knife. So, from that year on, every autumn night there would always be a small insect calling in the wilderness, the sound like weaving cloth. People called it "spinning maiden", said to be that lazy woman repenting, mourning and crying.

You want to laugh at the absurdity of this story, right? I'm laughing so hard I can't close my mouth!

The sound of insects on an autumn night is indeed very cute. I hope you can pay attention and listen.

### Mr. Lin

— Xie Beicheng

Mr. Lin glanced at the slip of paper, on which was written:

"Received from your teacher, a donation of 15,000 yuan in full, hereby."

He hesitated for a moment, picked up a pen and signed three words on it: Lin Ruhai. He looked at these three beautiful words with some sadness. Since he imitated Zhao Songxue at the age of thirteen, now that he is in his thirties, he may not be as good as Zhao Songxue, but he is much stronger than the "Qianlong Imperial Brush" kind of soft and boneless writing. But now he still has to wait for this 15,000 yuan teacher donation to be used.

A little embarrassed, he handed the slip of paper to the accountant with a blushing face, fanning himself with a practice book:

"It's so hot."

It seemed that it was too hot, and he had been bowing his head for too long, writing, and the blood had rushed to his head.

The accountant didn't pay attention to these things, he just kept his head down counting the banknotes, counting them once, then counting them again, counting them once, then counting them again, counting them once, then counting them again, counting them endlessly, he looked like an old postal worker troubled by his duties, his eyes were blurred as he looked at the sold stamps and the received banknotes.

After counting for a long time, Mr. Lin Ruhai, who was standing next to him, had already seen clearly: five thousand-yuan bills, five four-hundred-yuan bills, and six five-hundred-yuan bills, one five is five, four five is twenty, five six is thirty, a total of ten thousand yuan. It was hard to finish counting, and he raised his head and stuffed the banknotes into Mr. Lin's hand:

"A small token, a small token, ha, students' playthings!"

Mr. Lin's hands were a little trembling, before he had time to think of anything else, the accountant put his mouth to Mr. Lin's ear and chattered, then slapped Mr. Lin's shoulder hard with his thick palm, and said loudly:

"This Mr. Lin must be happy, if it weren't for this matter, the principal would have asked me to issue the appointment letter for next semester this morning, Mr. Lin can go home and receive it…" He gasped for breath, as if thinking about something, and suddenly narrowed his thin eyes again:

"Tuition fees will increase next semester. 120,000 for lower primary school, 150,000 for upper primary school, what about teachers' salaries? Naturally, naturally ha…"

Mr. Lin put a wry smile on the corner of his mouth, and raised the ten thousand yuan teacher donation—naturally, the receipt said fifteen thousand yuan—and nodded to the accountant:

"Goodbye, goodbye!"

Stepping out of the threshold of the pavilion, he remembered something, and turned his head back, almost tripping over the stairs:

"The opening day for next semester, has it been decided yet?"

The accountant faced him and grinned maliciously:

"Mr. Lin is an old teacher, asking too amateurishly, the enrollment advertisement says it's August 25th, naturally, naturally…"

"Will it be delayed for a few days?"

"If there aren't enough students, we'll wait a few days. Classes will start in mid-September anyway. It's hot, so it's good to rest a few more days!"

Mr. Lin felt a little depressed, he had wanted to find a way to improve his environment for a long time, but: his stomach rumbled, he was a little hungry.

The ten thousand yuan in his hand might be enough to eat seven or eight bowls of ribs noodles, but, alas, the tuition for primary school also costs 120,000, and the child Xiaolingzi at home… he almost burst into tears,——poor child, you were born into the wrong family, I'm afraid you'll have to drop out of school this semester.

The accountant's words rang in his ears:

"What about teachers' salaries? Naturally, naturally…"

A bright sun shone into his heart, it was a sunny day, and he believed a saying! "As the tide rises, so does the boat, and the boat will naturally straighten when it reaches the bridge." There is always a way, there is no hurdle that cannot be overcome.

But he was still reluctant to take a fraction of this ten thousand yuan to eat a bowl of ribs noodles, he carefully touched the pocket containing the ten thousand yuan, afraid that the sixteen pieces of paper money would grow wings and fly out.

Today is another sunny day, so the sun shines brightly on the street, but it's getting hot again. Mr. Lin's head is sweating. There is still a long way to go home. These past few years, his body has been weak, and he feels tired after walking a little. It would be nice to find a place to rest.

The sun was just a little slanted, and there was very little shade on the street. He walked along the wall, when suddenly something attracted him:

On the wall, in red watercolor, was written: "Air conditioning open"!

Above it were also written the words "Metropolis Theater," naturally, and "Today's Premiere," etc. Mr. Lin was not interested in these things. What he was most interested in was resting for a while in the wide hall outside the ticket counter. The cold air leaking out of the theater was enough to refresh his heart and soul.

He pushed open the bright glass door and walked in. The first movie had not yet ended, and it was still early before the second movie started. There were only three or four people in the hall—two men and women pointing and poking at the pictures over there, and three two women and one man leaning against the corner of the door telling jokes.

Mr. Lin thought to himself:

"These are really movie buffs, running over so early to wait for the premiere, really unbearable petty bourgeoisie!"

He remembered that there was such a sentence in a new literary book. However, the three young people over there were staring at him, so he had no choice but to pretend to be an "unbearable petty bourgeois" and go to the window to look at the pictures.

Mr. Lin was not in the mood to look at these miscellaneous pictures. He was going to rest here for a while and then go to look at the appointment letter that had just been sent home, and Xiaolingzi's tuition…

Mr. Lin's elbow was bumped by someone:

"Sir…"

Mr. Lin was startled, and fixed his eyes on what was in front of him. He was also staring at a picture, which showed a pretty woman being hugged and kissed hard by a mustachioed man. His face turned red all of a sudden.

Blushing, he looked to the side:

A girl—one of those three unbearable petty bourgeoisie—stood next to him, holding a large stack of books:

"Sir, buy a copy, help poor students!"

Mr. Lin looked at the book. He was unfamiliar with this kind of book, and—he touched his pocket again, the ten thousand yuan was still there.

"Sir, buy a copy, two thousand yuan a copy, help poor students go to school…"

Mr. Lin was really embarrassed. He knew he shouldn't have come in to cool off. Bah, still pretending to be a petty bourgeois! Bah, bah, bah!

He struggled for a long time, and blurted out a few words:

"I am a poor teacher!"—How embarrassing!

The girl was not embarrassed, it was truly difficult for her to say:

"Sir, you are too polite, teachers all hope that poor students can go to school, and it's just like watching an extra movie!"

Mr. Lin wanted to slap himself twice. When had he ever watched a movie? Why did he have to come to the movie theater to cool off and rest!

There was no way, he stuffed two thousand yuan into the girl's hand, and exchanged it for the book that was so unfamiliar to him—it really felt like cutting off Mr. Lin's flesh!—He no longer wanted to cool off, the longer he stayed, the more sweat beads would come out.

He hurriedly slipped out of the Metropolis Theater, calculating that half of the 15,000 yuan on the receipt was already gone, and what about Xiaolingzi's tuition? …

The sun in his heart shone again: "What about teachers' salaries? Naturally, naturally…"

He had to hurry back to look at the appointment letter. When he entered the door, the appointment letter was lying quietly on the desk, which said:

"…Next semester, we plan to hire Mr. Lin as a fifth-grade homeroom teacher, with a salary provisionally set at 85,000 yuan per month…"

Mr. Lin sighed and shouted loudly: "Xiaolingzi, you should also apply for student aid!"

In the early days of World War I, there was a popular song called "It's a Long, Long Way to Tipperary." This song can be said to be the most popular military song, but its author, Jack Judge, had to rush to the fish market during the day and put on makeup at night in order to make a living.

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng 26

"In 1933, we met again in Shenyang. I was working as a correspondent for the Japanese branch of the ×× News Agency, but in reality, I was a amphibious freelance writer of intelligence and journalism. At that time, most of the Japanese conspiracies, especially the conspiracies arranged by the Japanese for the League of Nations investigation team, were revealed by me…

"However, the credit is all due to Tsurumi Tamaki's efforts, (Sorry, I was working in this dangerous environment, first of all, I had to completely pretend that Chengzhi was a purely Japanese bloodline; even in my dreams, I couldn't reveal a single flaw, I had to keep being "Tsurumi"). …

"Originally, in the year he participated in the internship at the staff headquarters of the dispatch army, his adoptive mother passed away. The vacation to arrange the funeral at home became a major turning point in his life career—in his adoptive mother's box, he found a notebook and several handwriting of his father, especially the long letter written in danger. At the same time, he Liu was dissatisfied with the "decadent" style of people like Doihara; plus, he unintentionally discovered that he was a direct descendant of the Yellow Emperor, and his father was a revolutionary pioneer, so he was determined to avenge his motherland and do a great job…

"As a result, he himself decided to take on this dangerous role, secret within secret. However, the basic problem was that he had to first establish his foothold firmly before he could take action. For this, he concentrated his target on the communications section. Because this is the central hub of all news. As for other positions, he knew that, no matter what, he could not climb very high according to his age. If the position is not high, then what is the use of secretly inquiring about a little bit of overnight news? … Therefore, he chose the communications section as his position. …

"After more than a year of hard work, he invented a special code that was more ingenious than the original and had no drawbacks. Because of this achievement, he was immediately promoted to deputy section chief of the telecommunications section. When we met, he was already the chief of the section. At the same time, he also recruited some comrades—"complex" comrades, to slowly start working. …

"As for the role played by the brother, there are two names; one is their secretary, and the other is the Chinese affairs consultant. He also created some achievements for me, just to solidify the trust of those ghosts and demons, and consolidate my position, so the name "Yue Yang" is acceptable in the staff headquarters".

"I admire, I admire". Mr. W praised repeatedly, "No wonder we have repeatedly received mysterious reports from KCC, it turns out that this is the case. It is gratifying that our first line of special operations has been advanced into their staff headquarters"!

"That's how you can say it, but the Japanese devils are very cunning, and the internal affairs are also very discordant; therefore, even with our position, sometimes we can only find out 40 to 50 percent of all the quiet information. Also, the Black Dragon Society, that is a major base for secret operations. Although Tsurumi has some connections, it is also a way to use each other. Now he wants to officially join, as long as his boss ×× is willing to help…" …

—The above is the general outline of my conversation with Mr. W. Because it has been eight or nine years, the memory cannot be very accurate, and the dialogue is also very trivial, so it cannot be written according to the original dialogue. You think, Mr. W is a very busy person. He has phone calls and telegrams in just a few minutes, allocating work, and there are also things that must be dealt with in person. These few tens of minutes of conversation were interrupted no less than twenty or thirty times. All the conversations involved some repetitions and interludes. If I were to write it down stroke by stroke, I am afraid that you would not be patient with these trivialities.

—Before leaving, Mr. W opened the door and closed it again:

Random Talks on Life

### What is Friendship

We are all mortals, unable to escape the six senses and six dusts. Often, when we suffer grievances or troubles, we long for a confidant to whom we can pour out our hearts and weep. This intangible feeling expresses the need for friendship.

However, in my opinion, the first requirement for the existence of friendship is the elimination of vested interests. By vested interests, I mean obligations, legal constraints, or commercial ties. Therefore, father and son, siblings... sometimes find it difficult to develop friendship. A father and son cannot be intimate, not because of the difference in age, but because the father cannot talk to the son about "Dream of the Red Chamber" or "Nine-tailed Turtle," and the son cannot talk to the father about romance. They both carry a degree of false dignity or obedience; the relationship between the two is false and lacks genuine affection. Brothers are jealous and suspicious of each other in the pursuit of the same goals. Neither of these can produce sincere friendship.

We cannot make friends from childhood and maintain those friendships until old age, not because people today value righteousness less than the ancients, but because of environmental factors. I remember having a friend in middle school with whom I shared a bed and had late-night talks. But forced by circumstances, we parted ways and have not communicated since. Is this my betrayal? Is it his lack of fidelity?

Therefore, Zhuangzi's explanation of pure friendship is the most wonderful. He said, "To look at each other and weep, to be mutually agreeable at heart." Only this kind of friendship counts as complete. Besides this heart-to-heart connection, you must also need me and I must need you.

Han Yu said, "To study alone without friends is to be ignorant." We can interpret the word "study" broadly. For example, two friends who love Peking opera can certainly talk about Mei Lanfang. Another point is that friendship is not necessarily built on the personalities of the two people. Jean-Christophe (Note 1) and Olivier can be considered close friends, but their personalities are not the same. One is of strong German descent, while the other is of gentle French descent. Similarly, David Copperfield and Steerforth (Note 2), the former timid and elegant, the latter reckless and vulgar, also developed deep affection. David never remembered Steerforth's faults but only his virtues. Therefore, I believe that differences in personality are not an obstacle to friendship, but the distance cannot be too great, and it depends on the two people's sense of humor and tolerance.

Aroshchenko said, "Chicks always prefer to play with goslings, and ducklings go with ducklings." So if you are an opera fan, then I hope you make friends with opera enthusiasts. If you have a sense of humor or tolerance, then after three months you will also be able to sing a few lines of "Xipi Erhuang."

The occurrence of friendship is not as troublesome as love between men and women. Friendship does not distinguish between rich and poor (like Jia Baoyu and Qin Zhong), does not distinguish nationality (like Romain Rolland and Tolstoy, Flaubert and Turgenev), does not distinguish between ancient and modern (like Wang Guowei and Li Houzhu, Lin Yutang and Yuan Zhongdao). On a voyage, in a journey, in a factory or school, we can always find our understanding companion.

To put it scarily, a person without friends must be suffering from mental illness.

(Note 1) Jean-Christophe is the protagonist in Romain Rolland's novel.

(Note 2) David Copperfield is the protagonist of Dickens' "David Copperfield." (Mei Ruo)

### This Trend Should Be Encouraged

— Jiezi

Yesterday, local news reported: "A Russian offered a bribe to Guo Ziqing, an employee of the Public Utilities Bureau's Fourth Division, which Mr. Guo refused. This was witnessed by Mr. Yang Sen (a Westerner), a commissioner of the UNRRA and director of transportation. Mr. Yang sent a letter to Director Zhao of the bureau to report the matter and express his admiration."

How do you feel about this news? Although it is a public servant's duty not to accept bribes, in this "year of corruption," it is worth praising.

Indeed, looking back at the year since the victory, what we see in the newspapers are countless cases of ×× billions of yuan of fraud, ×× corruption, ×× bribery, ... so many that it is not surprising. Now, there is a news story of refusing a bribe, just like being tired of eating appetizers and changing to a different flavor.

Foreigners unanimously believe that corruption cases are everywhere in our country. The impression is too bad. Now, Mr. Guo's integrity was actually witnessed by foreigners, which is not a trivial matter.

In today's Chinese society, the spirit of integrity is not widespread enough. In addition to paying tribute to Mr. Guo, we should shout: "The trend of refusing bribes should be encouraged!"

### The Blue Danube

— Luo Ting

One of the history and geography questions in the new student exam of a certain school was: "What is the famous river in Europe?"

One student answered: "The Blue Danube." I don't know how he came up with this answer, he must be a music fan.

(Editor's note: "The Blue Danube" is a waltz composed by the king of waltzes, Johann Strauss.)

### Low Profile

— San Gong

The municipal government's implementation measures for the clean district system state: "...strive to clean the streets and alleys and remove the accumulated garbage from the past." In fact, what is "accumulated from the past" and urgently needs to be removed is not just garbage!

"Scraping from everyone's heads" should be cursed, but "scraping" for disaster relief is a praiseworthy thing, and it is hoped that there will be a big "scrape," the more the better.

Eight years of suffering, and "suffering" is still not over. Not only is it "difficult" for parents in terms of food, clothing, housing, and transportation, but even children's schooling has encountered unprecedented "difficulties."

In last month's expenditure items of the municipal government, education and culture only accounted for 9.94%, while police fees accounted for 26.56%. I am afraid that one day, there will be more police officers on the streets than students!

### Do You Know "Money"?

— Mo Gao

It's not about asking people for money, it's about taking money from our labor!

Knowing money is the beginning of understanding life.

Money that does not come from labor is someone else's sweat! Someone else's tears! Someone else's blood!

People with money are not necessarily happy, and people without money are not necessarily in pain.

The enemy is always the enemy of man!

If there is a man-eating demon in the world, this demon is money.

Those who fantasize about money will eventually have their lives taken by this demon.

Originally, there would be no slaves in the world. Because money is controlled by a few evil people;

So vulnerable people succumb.

For people with money, money begets money.

For people without money, money eats money.

You cannot judge people by their appearance, nor can you judge people by their money.

Money is a temptation, like the allure of beauty and the intoxication of good wine.

People who work hard have no money, people who have money don't work hard.

Dogs wag their tails and beg their owners for meat bones.

Slaves flatter their masters for money.

Numbness, fatigue, depression, and disappointment always belong to those who fantasize about money.

Do not use money to know people, nor use people to know money.

Originally, people would never bow their heads to others, but for money, people bow their heads!

Expenses should be less than income, not more than income.

This way, without the worry of money, happiness will always be around you!

For people without money, wanting money is "to survive."

For people with money who still want more money, it is "greed."

Being praised for having money is not praising your character.

Being praised for having no money is true praise!

### A Coincidence

— Li Liying

Dear Editor:

Yesterday morning, I went to the Ningbo Road ×× Bank to pay my tuition fees. I used all my strength to squeeze onto a trolley bus. I bought a copy of Shen Bao. When I mentioned the words "Pickpocket Insider" in your publication, I touched my pocket. When I saw the words "Beware of Pickpockets" in the middle, I touched my pocket again. After reading the last sentence, "Dear readers, beware of pickpockets!" I looked at the people around me and touched my pocket again. Unexpectedly, the tuition fees were gone.

It's so wonderful, so coincidental! So painful! After being indignant, I wrote this to report to you, sir. I wonder if you believe that there is such a coincidence in the world? Could it be that this article in your publication has the same effect as a "pickpocket opening a tie shop"?

### On Reforming English Teaching

— Jin Xia

In order to improve English teaching in middle schools, the Ministry of Education has convened two "English Teaching Research Conferences" in Chongqing. Recently, it held the third conference in Beijing. Principals, professors, and relevant personnel from the Ministry of Education attended. The main points of each proposal can be divided into the following key points:

(1) Junior high school English focuses on the preliminary training of speaking, reading, and writing? Senior high school focuses on the cultivation of reading ability, followed by conversation and writing.

(2) English is designated as a compulsory subject in both senior and junior high schools, with six hours of instruction per week.

(3) The Ministry will organize a "Middle School English Teaching Research Committee" to improve teaching.

(4) It is planned to establish specialized English schools from next year to train specialized teachers of English for middle schools.

From this, it can be seen that English teaching has been valued by the national education community. According to the high school curriculum published by the Ministry of Education on September 8, 1934, English classes in high school are five hours per week within three academic years. Revised and published on February 18, 1936, the middle school curriculum standards state: English in commercial middle schools is taught for five hours per week, and four hours per week in junior high schools. In the future, it will be increased to six hours per week.

I believe that the Ministry of Education's plan to reform English teaching in middle schools is undeniable from an academic standpoint. However, other original courses should still maintain a balanced proportion, and should not be given preference to some over others. Otherwise, even if the intention is good, it will inevitably be slandered by a few people and used as a "pretext" for ulterior motives.
