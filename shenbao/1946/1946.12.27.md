### The National Government and the Executive Yuan Will Be Reorganized Soon; The Number of Legislative and Supervisory Committee Members Will Be Increased; Consultations on Establishing a Constitutional Implementation Promotion Committee Are Underway

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] Following the conclusion of the National Assembly, the reorganization of the government has become a major issue of national concern. It is learned that the government is currently in consultation with various party figures. The National Government and the Executive Yuan will be reorganized simultaneously. The People's Political Council, the Legislative Yuan, and the Supervisory Yuan will also increase the number of committee members within the shortest possible time. However, the rumor that the number of legislators will be increased to 500 is unreliable. Furthermore, according to relevant personnel from the Legislative Yuan, the Legislative Yuan will have to draft many legal items within three months after the closing of the National Assembly, and these matters are of great importance. Therefore, the Legislative Yuan will be one of the busiest departments among the various ministries and departments of the government.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] It is learned that when the National Government and the Executive Yuan are reorganized, the Legislative Yuan and the Supervisory Yuan will also undergo slight changes. It is reported that the number of legislators will be increased by 50 during the transition period. The number of supervisors will be increased by 20 to 30. The newly added positions will accommodate various parties and non-party figures.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] According to Article 10 of the preparatory procedures for the implementation of the Constitution, after the Constitution is passed, the National Assembly representatives who formulated the Constitution will organize a Constitutional Implementation Promotion Committee, the methods for which will be determined by the National Government. It is heard that these methods are expected to be announced before the promulgation date of the Constitution, and the composition of the members is currently under discussion.

[United Press, South, 6th] Government officials stated that the government is currently drafting the organizational regulations for the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Committee. The committee will be composed of 50 representatives from various parties participating in the National Assembly and prominent figures in society. In addition to assisting in the implementation of the new Constitution, it will also undertake work similar to that of the Standing Committee of the National Political Council. It is heard that the abolition of the National Political Council is already under consideration. It is also learned that the government has begun to review existing laws, and those that conflict with the new Constitution will be abolished or amended. Officials here believe that the current Civil Code and Criminal Law will not undergo many changes, because any laws that restrict the freedom of the people or are considered incompatible with democratic principles have already been voluntarily suspended by the government after the victory.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] The 31st meeting of the Presidium of the National Assembly is scheduled to be held at 10:00 AM on the 27th to make final decisions in principle on the conclusion of the meeting and future matters. Furthermore, Chairman Chiang hosted a banquet for the entire Presidium at his official residence on Huangpu Road at 7:00 PM on the 26th.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] Chairman Chiang will separately meet with representatives of various parties participating in the National Assembly in the coming days. He hosted a lunch for Li Daming and Jiang Yuntian, representatives of the Democratic Socialist Party, on the 26th, and is scheduled to host a lunch for Chen Qitian, Zeng Qi, and others from the Youth Party on the 27th.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] At the closing of the National Assembly, each representative received a golden commemorative badge. Reporters also each received one, but the color was a swirling gray, far inferior to the former. However, its significance as a memento is the same. It is heard that each of the former is worth 140,000 yuan, and no replacements will be issued for any losses.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 26th] According to authoritative sources in diplomatic circles, the government will still send senior officials to Yan'an after the closing of the National Assembly.

As for the CCP's stance on the National Assembly, it is out of touch with the times, because the new Constitution has in fact implemented the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and stipulates the organization of a joint government based on the American presidential system, as well as other special innovations in China. All of these things include Western democracy and Dr. Sun Yat-sen's philosophy. The joint government will be established when the Constitution is formulated. If this government can replace the one-party government of the Nationalist Party, it will greatly help end the civil war.

### The Democratic League Continues to Discuss Its Attitude Towards the Current Situation

[Our Dispatch] Sun Baoyi, spokesman for the Democratic Socialist Party, told reporters that the Democratic League's request for the Democratic Socialist Party to withdraw from the League was expected long ago. The Democratic Socialist Party is an independent political party, and at the beginning of its establishment, it stated that if the Democratic League has any major decisions, it must obtain the consent of the Democratic Socialist Party. At that time, the Democratic League did not have any reaction, which can be regarded as tacit consent. And the Democratic Socialist Party's decisions do not have any obligation to seek the consent of the Democratic League in advance. Since the convening of the National Assembly, the Democratic League has not held a meeting to decide not to participate in the National Assembly, and this point is particularly noteworthy. Sun said that there are only about twenty people in the Democratic Socialist Party who participated in the Democratic League. How these twenty people will deal with themselves in the future will be a matter of concern, but the Democratic League is not a political party, so in fact there is no such thing as cross-party affiliation. Sun emphasized that the Democratic Socialist Party will never split, and said that after the Democratic League made this decision, the promotion of the party's affairs may be more convenient than before. The reporter then asked if the Democratic Socialist Party would still cooperate with the Democratic League if peace talks were reopened in the future. Sun replied that the meaning of the Democratic League's decision this time is non-cooperation within the League, but cooperation can still be done outside the League.

### Shanghai Soviet Overseas Chinese Clash with US Military Police; Soviet Union Lodges Protest with United States; Reportedly, US Soldiers Drank and Caused Accidents

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 25th] Regarding the conflict between US military police and Soviet citizens Martinov and Qiucha in Shanghai in September, Radio Moscow, citing TASS, reported that the Soviet Embassy in the United States has lodged a protest with the US State Department and urged it to pay attention to the matter. In September, an American soldier, while driving drunk in Shanghai, crashed into a car driven by Soviet citizen Martinov. Martinov immediately asked the American soldier to go to the police station together, but the American soldier refused and punched Martinov. At that time, about 20 American military police officers rushed to the scene and beat Martinov and his friend Qiucha. Martinov suffered head injuries, and his arms and legs were also beaten and injured. After the incident, the Soviet Consul General in Shanghai wrote to the US Consul General in Shanghai, Davis, but has not received a reply. US Army Commander Lieutenant General Gillen issued a report blaming the conflict on Soviet citizens Martinov and Qiucha. The Soviet government, in view of this situation, instructed its embassy in the United States to lodge a protest with the US State Department.

### American Newspapers Continue to Accuse the Soviet Union, Believing the Dalian Incident is a "Test" of Relations Between the Two Countries

[Central News Agency, Washington, 25th] Washington Post columnist Novotny elaborated on the Dalian incident on the 24th as a "test" of Soviet relations. Novotny warned that "the direct encounter between the United States and the Soviet Union in China is more than anywhere else in the world." The article pointed out that if the Soviet Union's policy in China continues to be perverse, the promotion of closer relations with the Soviet Union by the United States will become a bubble. Although the Soviet Union has expressed its friendly attitude at the United Nations General Assembly, its questionable position in China has aroused the concern of the world.

[Central News Agency, New York, 25th] The Scripps-Howard chain's World Telegram reported on the Dalian incident again today in an editorial, accusing the Soviet Union of being untrustworthy. It said that if the Soviet Union does not have good credibility, then the talks on concluding new treaties will also be in vain. The newspaper said that the Sino-Soviet Friendship Treaty originally stipulated that Dalian was a free port, but the control of the city and port of Dalian by the Red Army has at least made all the practical purposes of the treaty destroyed by unilateral actions. The Soviet Union's actions to abolish or change the agreement seem to be only for Soviet diplomacy and have not been consulted with the other contracting party and other parties related to the agreement. The newspaper said that even if the Soviet Union signs some parts of the treaty that are currently being negotiated, its value is still questionable. If the Soviet Union does not have good credibility, then this kind of negotiation will also be in vain. The newspaper also disclosed a cartoon on the same page as the editorial, titled "Free Port".

### Children Also Love Toy Guns; Willing to Trade Clothes for Them

The issue of education of the next generation deserves attention.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 26th] A fourteen-year-old peddler here recently tricked younger children into taking off their clothes with a wooden toy gun, arousing serious attention from the public on the education of the next generation. The peddler's name is Xu Xiaobao. He only has a lame mother and makes a living by selling peanuts. When he encountered two eleven-year-old children on the road, he showed them a wooden toy gun.

Editorial

### Looking at the Far East from the World

The successful conclusion of both the Foreign Ministers' Conference and the United Nations General Assembly has not only given the turbulent and uneasy year of 1946 a peaceful ending internationally, but also opened up a beautiful prospect for international politics in 1947. From now on, mankind can better believe that although the peace it has longed for day and night is still very far away, this common aspiration of mankind will eventually be realized. Therefore, the speeches delivered by politicians and diplomats of various countries to their respective peoples on Christmas expressed optimism and joy about the world of tomorrow. Santa Claus brought the gospel of peace, which is truly inspiring, and even the people in war-torn countries felt infinite warmth.

However, when looking at the situation in the Far East from the perspective of the world situation, a heavy and bleak shadow suddenly casts on everyone's heart; the Far East can be said to be the most fragile link in world politics; before the world experienced turmoil, it was already in the midst of raging flames of war; after all countries in the world can live in peace, there is still no hope for the flames of war in the Far East to be extinguished. Needless to mention the civil war in China, Indonesia first raised the banner of national liberation and engaged in a deadly struggle with the Dutch garrison. The bloodshed has lasted for more than a year, and only a draft of an Indonesian-Dutch agreement has been established so far, which has not yet been approved by both parties. Secondly, there is Vietnam. Under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh of the Viet Minh Republic, they originally wanted to achieve Vietnam's independence and autonomy through peaceful understanding. In order to achieve this goal, he personally went to Paris to conclude the French-Vietnamese Treaty with the French authorities to promote French-Vietnamese relations and seek the happiness of both parties; however, the French High Commissioner in Vietnam, Vice Admiral d'Argenlieu, never shed the past French attitude towards the Vietnamese people, which aroused the anger of the Vietnamese people and created the current turbulent situation. France is now under the rule of Socialist leader Blum, and there may be changes in the policies and attitudes it should adopt towards Vietnam; otherwise, the situation in Vietnam will inevitably deteriorate and it is unknown what kind of tragic situation it will create! Furthermore, for India and Burma, although the British Labor cabinet announced India's independence at the beginning of this year, and Prime Minister Attlee recently announced Burma's independence, the Indian internal affairs experienced the Indian-Muslim dispute. The Muslim League has always insisted on the proposition of Indian-Muslim partition and refused to participate in the Indian interim government, also adopting a bystander attitude towards the Indian Constitutional Assembly. Although Britain wants to mediate, the London British-Indian-Muslim tripartite round table conference has not achieved any results. The Muslim League has taken destructive actions everywhere in India, plunging India into a state of terror. Even though Mahatma Gandhi tried to persuade them with a hunger strike, it did not work. As for Burma, there is still a long way to go before true independence.

As the actual situation in Asia is as described above, the relations between the major powers in Asia have not yet been fully clarified. In particular, the positions that the United States and the Soviet Union should adopt on the Far East issue are still in an uncertain state. Since the United States and the Soviet Union can understand each other on certain world issues, it stands to reason that it is not difficult to reach a compromise on the Far East issue. But what is the actual situation? It is difficult to say. For example, on the issue of Japanese reparations, the opinions of the United States and the Soviet Union are completely different. How to reconcile and reach a compromise is a very difficult problem. Moreover, the Soviet Union has always expressed dissatisfaction with the US policy of controlling Japan. Secondly, the unification of Korea is also an urgent matter, to merge the US and Soviet occupied zones, otherwise, Korea will be artificially dismembered into two parts. Not only will the blood circulation be unable to flow smoothly, but also the pain of deep division will certainly not be able to discuss the issue of revival. Furthermore, there is the issue of Northeast China. The Soviet Union transported so much industrial equipment, which in the Soviet Union's view, is called war booty, and the reason for its removal is very sufficient; but in the United States' view, it believes that this is not war booty, but should be used as Japanese reparations. The two sides stick to their own words, and no conclusion has been reached so far. Recently, the Dalian incident suddenly occurred. Although the American public opinion circles attached great importance to this, the American authorities, in order to avoid the deterioration of US-Soviet relations, expressed indifference and hoped that China and the Soviet Union would directly negotiate a solution. The US State Department's ability to take the overall situation into consideration and not focus on small things is a wise approach. However, the Soviet authorities are still haggling over small things with the United States. For example, the conflict between Soviet citizens and US military police in Shanghai a few months ago was originally a very trivial matter, but the Soviet diplomatic authorities made a big fuss about it, and the Soviet ambassador to the United States even lodged a protest with the US State Department, which makes us ultimately feel that the Soviet authorities do not cherish the opportunity to improve US-Soviet relations very much, which cannot but be regretted.

In short, when looking at the Far East from the perspective of the world, although the Far East is still before dawn, mankind is progressing. Especially after the Second World War, its progress will be even faster. The flames of war in Vietnam and the East Indies are enough to prove that the era of imperialism has come to an end. At the same time, judging from various factors, especially President Truman's recent declaration on China, which reiterated that the declaration on China issued on December 15 last year remains effective, it is truly believable that the situation in the Far East also has the hope of improving with the improvement of the overall world situation.

The benefits in the final year can reach the point of sufficiently supplying the province's people and reducing the province's food shortage by 40% and clothing material by 30%.

Culture

The culture department focuses on eliminating illiteracy in the province and cultivating vocational and professional talents. A total of 43,968 national schools, 32 vocational schools, 103 normal schools, 103 middle schools, and 5 specialized schools are planned to be built, and 100 students will be trained to study abroad. The benefits in the final year can eliminate 80% of illiteracy in the province and reserve 60% of construction talents.

Politics

The political department focuses on implementing local autonomy and consolidating the foundation of constitutional government. It is divided into special chapters such as grassroots construction, police construction, financial construction, land administration construction, health construction, social construction, cooperative undertakings, and municipal construction, in order to establish the scale of modern politics. According to the person in charge of the committee, the plan is based on the central government's national policy and the principles of the material and cultural construction plan of the Central Design Bureau, and refers to the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan and the American TVA system, as well as the actual situation in the province. The design of each project provides detailed planning for the past overview, the central business's annual progress, expected benefits, required funds, and talents.

Funds

The amount of funds is set at 600 million yuan in pre-war currency values. There are separate plans for fundraising methods, which are said to be being submitted to the central government for approval. According to our reporter's observation, Guangdong is a politically stable area, and its economy and funds have always been very active. If overseas Chinese capital can be utilized, idle funds can be absorbed, and this can be adhered to, then the achievements of construction in the future will not only enable Guangdong, the birthplace of the revolution, to enter a new stage of construction, but will also be of great benefit to the future of national construction.

Therefore, the fourth Bao in Shangyu Township in the county raised funds to hire supported soldiers. Those who want to avoid being conscripted have to pay 20,000 yuan per able-bodied man.

### With the National Assembly Concluding Amidst Acclamations, The Constitution is Born, and the Representatives are Much More Relaxed

— Our Correspondent Zhang Ming

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The National Assembly Hall today truly resembled a place celebrating a joyous event. It was both warm and bright, with crowds of people coming and going. Everyone greeted each other with smiles, feeling that they had one less thing on their minds but one more burden on their shoulders. This burden is what every citizen of the Republic of China should bear from today onwards.

Mr. Wu Zhihui, serving as chairman, presented the precious original copy of the Constitution to Chairman Chiang, like Santa Claus bringing the most precious gift.

Mr. Hong Lan's newly trimmed hair and full formal attire made him look like the main character in a household celebrating a happy occasion. His tone was steady and skillful when he read out the document, sounding pleasant to the ear, a world apart from the several fatigue bombardments of the past forty days.

Inside the Assembly Hall, the representatives greeted each other with farewells, discussing nothing more than means of transportation, dates of departure, and numerous farewell banquets. It was indeed a parting for a year, hoping to gather again on this day next year, with endless reluctance. This was a touch of sorrow amidst the joy of the assembly.

Before the meeting, someone was announcing: "All colleagues who participated in the National Conference in the 20th year of the Republic of China and are now participating in the National Assembly, please note that we previously formulated the Provisional Constitution, and today we have completed the Constitution. We hope that after the meeting, colleagues will gather for a commemorative photograph."

Starting today, the draft Constitution of the Republic of China has changed one word, formally becoming a "law." A Constitution bound in brocade and affixed with a red satin strip on the cover, with the words "Constitution of the Republic of China" embossed in gold, in a font three times the size of the late Founding Father's handwriting, is precious and valuable.

The Constitution was only passed at noon today, but it was handed over by the Assembly in the afternoon. It is said that this was achieved single-handedly by Ye Yi, a nameless hero and secretary of the National Assembly. He spent several sleepless nights for this Constitution, and his handwriting has finally become an immortal document in history.

The Constitution was placed on a specially made wooden frame, which was painted with a national flag and inscribed with the words "National Assembly" below. It was placed on the rostrum and surrounded by colorful silk, attracting a constant stream of people who came to admire it, and teams of photographers who came to capture their artistic shots in various styles and angles.

Before the meeting, Mr. Wu Zhihui and the Chairman arrived, with Mr. Wu in front and the Chairman behind. When the meeting adjourned, the Chairman still allowed Mr. Wu to go first, but Mr. Wu repeatedly declined, and as a result, the Chairman stepped out first with a smile.

When Secretary-General Hong and Minister Wu went on stage to hold the handover ceremony, Hong was in front and Wu was behind. When they came down, they deferred to each other, with Wu going first and Hong following behind. These were all meaningful scenes.

When Chairman Chiang delivered his speech, all the representatives maintained a very high level of enthusiasm, and thunderous applause erupted in the hall from time to time. In the end, the sound of "Long live the Republic of China" resounded throughout the hall.

The busiest people in the hall were those signing autographs: journalists, assembly staff, and representatives were all busy asking people to sign their names, especially Mr. Yu Youren, who never stopped writing.

After the National Assembly, the current term is over, and the crown will be taken off and replaced with common clothes.

The photography business outside the entrance of the Assembly Hall was good. Before and after each meeting, groups of people were always taking group photos there. Although it was raining today, they still had no rest. It is said that the Assembly had planned to take a group photo of all the representatives, but the location was difficult to find. In the end, it was decided to be at the Mausoleum, but the weather was uncooperative. It was impossible to take the photo on a rainy day, and most of the representatives will be returning home starting tomorrow, so the photo will probably not be taken.

The last refreshment for the representatives was Mei Lanfang's opera, which was performed at the Lizhi Society tonight and will be performed at the Dahua Theater starting tomorrow. The representatives are in for a treat.

### Wuxing Silk Industry Faces Serious Crisis, Cloth and Department Stores Close Down One After Another

[Our Wuxing Dispatch] This county produces silk, which is famous throughout the country. Since the victory, due to the stimulus of soaring gold prices, the pressure of high-interest loans, the heavy burden of various taxes, and the increase in wages, business has plummeted and the future is precarious. Although the authorities have consulted with the Four Joint Offices to provide silk loans to help them get through the Lunar New Year, the loan terms of the Four Joint Offices are too harsh and are still under negotiation. Other cloth and department stores have suffered heavy losses due to the weak purchasing power of the people and the sluggish market, making it impossible to maintain their operations. More than a dozen stores have closed down one after another within a month. Recently, Tongyu Silk Cloth Store, which has been in business for the longest time and has the largest scope, also suddenly closed down on the 24th of this month and has asked lawyer Jiang Zhongming to announce the liquidation. Keda Cloth Store is also selling off its inventory in preparation for closing down. In the past three days, the prices of essential goods and daily necessities have skyrocketed without end. The price of sesame cakes and fried dough sticks has suddenly doubled, posing a great threat to ordinary people and salaried workers.

### Suzhou County Government, Provincial Government Instructs Eight Points

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 26th] Suzhou County Magistrate Shen Chenglong returned to Suzhou on the 26th via Wuxi after attending the provincial government's local budget conference. According to his statement to reporters, the total budget for the county next year is 13 billion yuan, and the provincial government may reduce it to 12 billion yuan. Once it is submitted to the provincial government's regular meeting for approval, it can be officially approved. Furthermore, during this trip to the province, the provincial government instructed eight points on the county's general administration: (1) avoid superficial revenue and actual expenditure in the budget; (2) unnecessary agencies should be abolished; (3) schools should emphasize quality over quantity; (4) complete the layout of the telephone network in various townships; (5) township units should be rationally merged as much as possible; (6) intensify the collection of taxes; (7) appropriately increase the license tax rate, to be decided by the county and submitted to the province for approval; (8) the Suzhou-Ningbo Branch has agreed to provide material support for the water supply installation project, and it is expected to use work as a substitute for salaries.

### Gold Rooster 범 [general term for river or lake] Rampant Robbery, Nine People Bound and Thrown into the River, Attempted to Rob Pig Transport Boat, Resorting to Poisoning When Unable to Obtain Cash, Only One Boatman Struggled to Escape

[Our Huguan Dispatch] At 4:30 AM on December 24th, a pig boat traveling eastward from Wangting, carrying 49 large pigs, was passing by Gold Rooster 범 at about 4:45 AM when it was suddenly attacked by a bandit boat ambushing there. Six bandits, armed with one pistol, boarded the boat and robbed it. Because there was no cash, they bound all nine people, including boatmen Ji Zian, Ji Rongxiang, Ji Pingshou, Pan Jin'er, and pig merchants surnamed Cao and Ji, as well as passengers traveling to Shanghai, and threw them into the river. Boatman Ji Rongxiang, due to the looseness of the rope, struggled to escape, soaking wet, and ran to the Huguan Town Self-Defense Corps headquarters to report. After receiving the report, the town mayor immediately led 14 members of the Self-Defense Corps to search for the perpetrators at the scene of the incident. After more than four hours, they found nothing except one abandoned bandit boat and one empty boat, which were taken back to the corps headquarters. The details of the incident and the boats have now been submitted to the district branch, and they will continue to apprehend the perpetrators in conjunction with the town police station. The search for the remaining eight drowned victims is also underway.

### Mutai Arrives in Vietnam for On-Site Investigation, French Forces in Hanoi Advance in Fan Shape, D'Argenlieu Clarifies French Policy

[United Press Paris, 26th] As France's Minister of Colonial Affairs, Mutai, conducts an on-site investigation in Vietnam, Vietnamese forces have been advancing in a fan shape in the northern Annam and Tonkin provinces, with Viet Minh forces still putting up strong resistance.

[Associated Press Paris, 25th] According to a recent communique issued by the French General Staff in Hanoi, the only place completely controlled by the French forces is the capital of the Viet Minh government. Viet Minh forces are still resisting stubbornly in the surrounding areas. The communique stated: "The pacification war in the city center has already begun."

[Agence France-Presse Saigon, 25th] The French military staff has just issued a communique announcing that the French forces have continued to make progress in Vietnam. It stated that the French forces have surrounded the Annamite residential areas of Hanoi and are currently carrying out pacification work. Viet Minh resistance is still very active, but the French forces are constantly advancing towards the cemetery area. Another French team departed from Hanoi and arrived in Bac Ninh this morning and is now continuing to advance towards Phuc Mai. In the Nam Dinh area, Viet Minh forces are still attacking the train station day and night. Among the Viet Minh corpses and several Japanese soldiers' corpses, the Viet Minh losses were heavy, but they are still launching military operations with a very large number of people. The Hai Duong Railway Bridge has been destroyed by Viet Minh forces. A batch of French reinforcements has arrived in Hai Duong from Haiphong. The outskirts of Haiphong are currently being heavily bombarded by Viet Minh mortars. French forces in Lang Son and Da Yen have now made contact, and 3,500 Viet Minh forces attacked Hue on the 19th of this month and were repeatedly defeated by the French forces.

[United Press Paris, 25th] France today launched an effort to strengthen its political and military lines in Vietnam. The first brigade of the French parachute division has departed from North Africa aboard the cruiser "Duguay-Trouin" for Vietnam.

[Agence France-Presse Saigon, 26th] France's Minister of Overseas Colonies, Mutai, flew here from Calcutta last night. French senior military and political officials in Vietnam welcomed him at the airport. In response to reporters' inquiries, Mutai only said that he was here to conduct on-site inspections and did not want to say more. He added that his stay in Vietnam would be very brief, and he planned to return to France around January 16th. He said that his trip had the full agreement of the National Assembly and that the policy of protecting the French people and friendly allies would not change.

[Agence France-Presse Saigon, 25th] The arrival of France's Minister of Overseas Colonies, Mutai, has caused a great shock here, similar to the situation when the Minh government fled. Political observers believe that the presence of Minister Mutai and French High Commissioner to Vietnam, d'Argenlieu, in Saigon proves that the French government is willing to reach an agreement with the Viet Minh government.

[Agence France-Presse Cairo, 25th] General Leclerc, commander of the French Far East Forces, who went to Vietnam for inspection, passed through here last night and left for Calcutta after a brief rest. According to Reuters, Le Gleize received the following instructions before leaving: (1) study the military situation; (2) study the causes of the conflict and ways to restore peace; (3) estimate the total number of reinforcements needed; and (4) report the findings to the Minister of Overseas Colonies, Mutai. The report added that the French authorities plan to transfer another 20,000 troops to reinforce Vietnam, to be transported by the French mail ship "Ile de France" and the former aircraft carrier "Bearn".

[United Press Saigon, 25th] French High Commissioner to Vietnam, d'Argenlieu, gave a broadcast speech to the French residents here today, the content of which roughly stated that France would not agree to the Vietnamese people's demand for complete independence. Independence is nothing but a myth, which is seriously harmful to the interests of both France and Vietnam, but France is willing to fulfill local autonomy agreements. If unconditional and complete independence is granted at the current stage of Vietnamese people's evolution, it would not be a blessing for either side.

### Vietnam Designates Neutral Zones to Guarantee the Safety of Overseas Chinese, Negotiations by Our Consul-General Have Failed

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] The situation in Vietnam has rapidly deteriorated in the past week due to the French military actions that triggered the Viet Minh government's resistance. The lives and property of overseas Chinese in Vietnam have been severely damaged. They have submitted requests to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, asking to negotiate with both the French and Vietnamese sides to designate "neutral zones" in cities where overseas Chinese are concentrated, such as Haiphong and Hanoi. It is reported that our diplomatic authorities are considering this proposal.

Furthermore, the negotiations between China and France regarding the implementation of the agreement on the Vietnam issue, which were resumed on the 20th, have stalled again in recent days. This is because the current chaotic situation in Vietnam requires on-site investigations in Vietnam before deciding on a number of issues, such as the designation of the Haiphong free zone, the design of the Yunnan-Vietnam joint transportation plan, and the valuation of compensation for material equipment, all of which cannot be carried out. However, the French delegation still in Beijing and our negotiators all hope that the crux of the issue between France and Vietnam can be resolved quickly, so that the situation in Vietnam can be restored to peace, and that these negotiations can yield results as soon as possible.

[Agence France-Presse Hanoi, 25th] In the conflicts between French and Vietnamese troops in recent days, only one overseas Chinese has been confirmed dead so far, and the property losses of overseas Chinese are relatively small. However, the lives and property of overseas Chinese in the European quarter have not been damaged. French troops are currently stationed at the boundary between the overseas Chinese area and the Vietnamese area. The Chinese Consul-General in Vietnam entered the area yesterday to contact the Vietnamese and overseas Chinese in order to delineate a neutral zone, but announced this morning that this mission had failed. He will continue his efforts to make this plan a reality. In addition, according to French officials, General Moriere, the commander of the French forces in North Vietnam, has agreed to establish a neutral zone.

### Vietnamese People in France March and Demonstrate, Demanding an Immediate Ceasefire Between France and Vietnam

[Our Dispatch] London, 26th Broadcast: Four hundred Vietnamese nationals in Bordeaux, France, held a demonstration in support of the Viet Minh government, distributing leaflets calling on French workers to unanimously demand permission for Vietnamese independence.

### French Cabinet Meeting: Prime Minister Reports on the Situation in Vietnam

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 26th] The French Cabinet met today to hear Prime Minister Blum report on the international situation and the latest developments in Vietnam.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 25th] According to an official gazette announcement: Minister of Overseas Colonies Moutet will be temporarily replaced by Minister of State Laurent during his absence from the country.

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 26th] The "New York Post" recently commented on the establishment of the French Fourth Republic under difficult circumstances, considering it worthy of attention. It elaborated on its reasons as follows: In domestic affairs, the primary concern is the failure to form a government that truly represents all aspects of society, with the Socialist Party forming the cabinet alone. This party holds only one-sixth of the seats in the National Assembly. Secondly, financial difficulties are currently causing France considerable distress. Thirdly, the post-war vitality has not yet fully recovered. In terms of the international situation, France's foreign policy is also wavering between the East and the West. Prolonged government instability cannot alleviate these difficulties. Regarding the Vietnam issue, France, already struggling to cope, is further burdened by engaging in a colonial war. However, considering the deeply rooted humanitarian spirit of the French people, there is still reason for optimism about the future.

### German POWs Joining the War: Deserting on the Battlefield

[United Press, Manila, 25th] According to travelers arriving here by plane from Bangkok, German prisoners of war participating in the French army in Vietnam deserted on the battlefield when the French army was fighting the Viet Minh forces in northern Vietnam. However, this news has not yet been confirmed. The French army is conducting strict inspections along the Vietnamese border, making it difficult for the outside world to obtain detailed information about the situation inside. However, it is said that people in Bangkok are generally aware of the German POWs participating in the French army and their desertion.

### Patterson's Speech: The US Yearns for Peace

The Purpose of Universal Military Training: To Safeguard National Security

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 25th] Secretary of War Patterson, in a Christmas speech to American wounded veterans, stated that we yearn for peace. Peace is still very far away, but the great powers must agree to discuss disarmament with each other so that the world may have hope for an early conclusion of peace.

[United Press, Washington, 25th] Regarding the implementation of universal military training in the United States, President Truman stated: I intend to remove the word "military" from "universal military training" because the meaning represented by the word military is already contained within what I consider training. The War Department today issued a pamphlet strongly advocating the importance of universal military training, stating that the majority of universal military training will focus on physical development, and will also add subjects related to religious education. Some courses in universal military training already have educational implications, but education is only a byproduct of the training. The purpose of training is definitely not to establish a similar system outside of the existing education system. Universal military training must contribute to national security, otherwise it should not be implemented.

### Death of a Soviet General

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 26th] Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky, a famous Soviet general of World War II, passed away today at the age of fifty-five. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet has decided to posthumously award him the Order of Lenin in recognition of his services.

### Asian International Conference: To Be Held in March Next Spring, Nehru Will Meet with Gandhi to Discuss

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 26th] It was announced here today that the Asian International Conference is scheduled to open here on March 24th next year and close on April 3rd. Invitations have been sent to 32 countries, but no replies have been received yet, nor has any country indicated its inability to participate. Among non-Asian countries, only Egypt has been invited to participate. The conference will likely be opened by Jawaharlal Nehru, Vice-President of the Indian Provisional Government. Mrs. Naidu, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee, is now arranging everything.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 25th] Regarding the conference of Asian peoples to be held in Delhi, the non-partisan magazine "The Spectator" commented: The recent political maneuvers taken by Jawaharlal Nehru, Vice-President of the Indian Provisional Government, aim to launch his own pan-Asian movement. Nehru's plan is supra-religious and supra-ethnic in nature, aiming to organize a common Asian front to counter the exploitation of Western countries. It differs greatly from Japan's "Greater East Asia" concept. This plan is truly pan-Asian, broad in scope, encompassing everyone from Japanese Shintoists in the east to Lebanese Christians in the west. It holds an optimistic view, believing that all Asian peoples can cooperate hand in hand with love and understanding. Nehru's plan, like the views he holds, is truly great. But whether Nehru believes that a pan-Asian federation can tolerate the existence of Pakistan, and whether Jinnah, the leader of the Muslim League, is willing to see a pan-Asian federation led by Hindus, are all questions. Jinnah believes that as long as Nehru is the head of the Indian government, Islam is in danger, and the Archbishop of Jerusalem deeply agrees.

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 26th] Indian Provisional Government Prime Minister Nehru, Congress President Kripalani, and Party Secretary-General R. M. Lohia will fly to Calcutta tomorrow to discuss the current political situation with Mahatma Gandhi. It is reported that Nehru will return here next week to preside over the Indian Science Congress, which will open on January 2nd, and scientists from various countries will come to participate.

[Reuters, Bombay, 25th] The Bombay government gazette stated: There is still unrest in the city of Bombay today. Police fired on crowds throwing stones, and there were five stabbing incidents, one arson incident, and one acid attack incident throughout the city.

### Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr. Returns Home: To Write a Travelogue on the Soviet Union, Expresses Dissatisfaction with Truman's Policies

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 26th] Colonel Elliott Roosevelt, son of the late President Roosevelt, and his wife, returned here today after traveling in Poland and the Soviet Union for eight weeks. The son refused to announce the purpose of his audience with Marshal Stalin, only confirming that Stalin seemed to be in excellent health. Reportedly, Roosevelt Jr. visited the Soviet Union at the invitation of the American magazine "Look," and will now write six travel articles for the magazine. It is said that the content will mostly be about the recovery situation in the Soviet Union. Roosevelt Jr. has expressed disagreement with American foreign policy several times in the past, believing that it does not conform to his father's ideals, and advocates that American foreign policy should be formulated after consultation between the leaders of the Republican and Democratic parties, and that their opinions must be consistent. The text to be published by Roosevelt Jr. will be accompanied by photos taken by Mrs. Roosevelt in the Soviet Union, and these photos have not been censored.

### Iran-Soviet Negotiations: Expanding Trade

[Agence France-Presse, Tehran, 26th] The Iranian government has appointed Mansur as the governor of Azerbaijan Province, replacing Sadiq, the former governor. Sadiq was suspected of supporting the Azerbaijan independence movement a year ago.

### British Ambassador to Spain Recalled to London: The British Government First Implements UN Resolution, Spanish Newspapers Criticize British Ambassador for Transgressing

[United Press, London, 25th] British Ambassador to Spain Sir Victor Mallet, recalled to his country, arrived here by plane today. The United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution in New York calling on member states to recall their ambassadors to Spain in disapproval of the Franco government. Mallet is the first ambassador to be recalled by the United Nations.

[Reuters, Madrid, 26th] British Ambassador Mallet departed for his country today. Madrid newspapers had published news that made Mallet feel uneasy, accusing the British Embassy here of actively participating in the anti-Franco movement. In fact, while the British Embassy here had contacted people from various factions in Spain while engaging in customary social activities, as far as British reporters know, the anti-Franco elements in Spain were still dissatisfied with the British and American embassies for not daring to actively sympathize with them. The internal relations among the various anti-Franco factions in Spain have not improved over the past year. The declaration issued by Britain, the United States, and France on March 4th, expressing their hope that the Franco government would step down voluntarily and establish a provisional government to hold general elections, further angered the royalist faction among the anti-Franco factions. By July and August, negotiations for unified action among the various anti-Franco factions had almost completely stalled, and the factions still could not reach an agreement on the form of the future government of Spain. In September, the Communist Party abandoned cooperation with the various factions and decided to adopt a decisive republicanism, thus further fragmenting the various anti-Franco factions in Spain.

### A Major Post-War Issue: The Repatriation of Japanese Troops and Civilians

The three million people in the China mainland area have already been repatriated. In addition, there are one million people who were originally in the Northeast region. Due to the complexity of the political situation, the fate of these Japanese people is still uncertain.

Repatriating millions of Japanese prisoners of war and civilians from China back to Japan is indeed a vast and difficult task, but with the cooperation of the United States and China, it can generally be said to have been "successfully completed."

On the day the Japanese Emperor announced the unconditional surrender rescript, the day the Japanese army laid down its weapons, which was also the day the World War and the Sino-Japanese War officially ended, there were four million Japanese troops and civilians in China. However, after a year of efforts, three million of them have returned to their homeland. The remaining one million were originally in Manchuria (the Nine Northeastern Provinces). Due to the profound and unpredictable Soviet policies, the repatriation of these one million people has not been resolved for the time being, and the United States also feels helpless.

Loneze, a special correspondent for "World Report Weekly," recently sent a report from Shanghai, explaining the inside story of the repatriation of Japanese troops and civilians very clearly. Now, the main points are translated below.

The work of repatriating Japanese troops and civilians began in December last year with the cooperation of the United States and China. The method was to systematically disarm them first, and gradually concentrate them together. However, China is vast and the distribution of Japanese troops and civilians is extremely wide, so it had to be carried out in different areas. At that time, it was decided to first handle the South China, Taiwan, and Vietnam areas, and a total of more than 600,000 Japanese were repatriated in more than three months. The next area was Central China, where a total of more than 800,000 Japanese were repatriated. The last area was North China, where a total of about 554,000 Japanese were repatriated, which was recently completed.

During the repatriation process, a noteworthy conclusion was reached regarding the extent to which Japanese civilians had penetrated into China: the ratio of Japanese troops to Japanese civilians was three to two. In other words, for every three Japanese soldiers repatriated, two civilians were repatriated. The progress of the repatriation of Japanese soldiers had a dual impact on Japan itself: on the one hand, there was a general feeling of comfort, feeling that the nationals scattered in various places had finally returned; on the other hand, it aroused various economic anxieties.

On the bright side, many families were able to reunite, the surplus labor could be applied to production work, and the government was not at a loss when drafting the revival plan. This point greatly enhanced the prestige of the United States, because unlike the Soviet Union, the United States was able to abide by the responsibilities stipulated in the Potsdam Declaration.

But on the bad side, the costs of repatriating Japanese troops and civilians had to be borne mostly by the Japanese government, and this expense was quite large. At the same time, it was really a tricky matter to accommodate so many returning troops and civilians in Japan's shattered post-war economic structure. What's more, the food and housing problems became even more serious. But no matter how bad the bad side was, the Japanese still felt that the rapid progress of the repatriation work was worthwhile. Therefore, no matter how huge the expenditure, they still hoped to send the one million Japanese troops and civilians in Manchuria back to their country as soon as possible. But this matter is more complicated because the Soviet Union is involved.

The rapid repatriation of Japanese troops and civilians from the US-controlled area made the Japanese feel dissatisfied with the Soviet measures. This can be seen from the recent demonstration held by the Japanese in front of the Soviet Embassy in Tokyo, demanding the acceleration of the repatriation work. The Soviet Union has always paid great attention to Japan, and has greatly promoted the glory of communism and the Soviet Union's concern for the Japanese people. However, the twists and turns in the repatriation work have obviously been a major blow to the work of the Japanese Communist Party and the Soviet delegation.

After many compromises, the Soviet Union finally decided to repatriate 10,000 to 15,000 Japanese from a port in eastern Siberia every month (recent reports said that MacArthur and the Soviet authorities had established an agreement to repatriate 50,000 people per month - translator), but the Japanese still cannot feel very satisfied, because when the United States repatriated Japanese from mainland China, the peak of the work reached 12,000 people repatriated per day.

Another thing that made the Japanese dissatisfied was that the Soviet Union was prepared to send Japanese civilians first, and delay the repatriation of Japanese prisoners of war as much as possible. According to estimates from all parties, there are at least 800,000 Japanese troops in Soviet hands. The United States believes that 700,000 of them have been transported from Manchuria to Siberia, working in labor camps. The Japanese believe that this violates the Potsdam Declaration. At the same time, according to the current method, it will take at least several years to repatriate one million people.

How things will develop in the future is of course not something anyone can predict, because the situation can change at any time. But one thing is very worthy of attention, that is, the repatriation of Japanese troops and civilians from the China mainland area has been completed. The war that Tokyo has always called the "Sino-Japanese Incident" has formally and officially ended after a long nine years. (Translated by Ya Nong from "World Report Weekly")

### Celebrating the Christmas Festival: The British King Broadcasts a Message, Encouraging the People with the Word "Courage"

[Agence France-Presse, London, 25th] King George VI of England spent the Christmas holiday today with the royal family at Sandringham House, sharing a Christmas dinner, with turkey and plum pudding as the main dishes. After the meal, the King stepped into the study and broadcast the Christmas message to the people of the country in front of the golden microphone.

His words included: On this Christmas day, I and the Queen are reunited with the royal family in the palace to spend the holiday, and we are all mindful of the British Empire as a large family spanning the globe. The war has left the world full of wounds, with rubble everywhere. Politicians bear the heavy responsibility of stabilizing the world, and it has been no easy task to work tirelessly for a year. Only with continued patience and goodwill can the world return to normal. When Britain encountered bombing, we showed our spirit, and in the future we will still be able to re-demonstrate the same spirit with patience and discipline. We are celebrating Christmas today as free people in a peaceful environment. People may still feel a lack of essential supplies in their daily lives, but we should not worry too much about the current difficulties, we should think of the great future. Mobilize the spirit of Christ to remedy our daily lives and to relieve the suffering people everywhere.

[United Press, London, 25th] The Archbishop of Canterbury issued a Christmas message today, urging people to increase their faith. He said that the situation is difficult, and the moral and material conditions in various parts of the world are dangerous, pressing on the spirit of everyone and everyone, how can we still talk about increasing faith at this time? But Christmas tells us how to obtain peace and joy, and humans cannot create peace and joy on their own. Christ came to give peace and joy, and mankind must humbly accept it.

### International Female Devil: Old Serpent Beauty

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 25th] The head of the mobile reconnaissance unit in Nice, Valley Danri, arrested a serpent beauty yesterday, suspected of killing more than twenty people. The arrested person is Madame Tang Doulan, also known as the Baroness, and some even respect her as the Marchioness. Most of her fifty years have been spent in the Middle East, especially in Syria and Lebanon. In 1936, her husband, Baron Bell, was assassinated in a hotel in the Syrian desert, suffering nineteen knife wounds. The hotel was established by the Baron. Madame Tang sought revenge for her husband, resulting in the arrest of two suspects. However, two French military officers publicly suspected that the murderer was Madame Tang herself. Shortly afterward, the two officers went out and were nearly run over by Madame Tang's car. The two men sued the police, but to no avail. Later, Tang Doulan remarried a Muslim and lived in the home of a relative of an Arab king, virtually under house arrest. In 1939, she sneaked into Mecca, the holy city of Islam, to sell a large quantity of jewelry and diamonds of unknown origin. She had previously seduced an official of an embassy, ​​so she was able to leave the country smoothly. After arriving in Mecca, she also attempted to kill an Arab chieftain. The King was furious and sentenced her to death, but she was resourceful and escaped to North Africa. During World War II, she was even regarded as a political prisoner and received protection. In August of this year, Tang Doulan and her son (a reporter for a newspaper in Nice) came to Nice and began to enjoy themselves. Until recently, the mother and son were arrested for trafficking in gold, but her son was soon released. Detective Chief Valley Danri had been following her throughout Syria, Lebanon, and North Africa. According to him, "She is a most dangerous woman. She knows how to use poison or a dagger." It is said that fifteen to twenty men have died at her hands, but the police department is keeping the entire case secret, and details will probably be released after the suspect is brought to Paris.

The fuselage and nose of Central Air Transport Corporation's Flight 48, which crashed in the rice fields of Zhangjiazhai, Zhang Huabang, Jiangwan, have been completely split and burned, with only the tail remaining. When the reporter went to inspect the scene yesterday afternoon along a muddy path, thick smoke was still coming out of the remaining parts of the tail. In the rice field, there was a liver and lungs that had turned purple-red, and a severed woman's foot. Two people in military uniforms and a village child were groping in the water. One of them claimed to have found a gold ring, and the village child picked up several thousand-yuan and five-hundred-yuan bills, squatting in the pond to wash off the mud.

The plane took off from Chongqing at 8 a.m. yesterday morning and arrived in the Shanghai area at 5:30 p.m. Due to the dense fog, Longhua Airport did not have blind landing equipment, so it turned to Jiangwan. According to Central Air Transport Corporation, the plane made contact with the ground at the time, but due to the heavy fog and poor visibility, it overran the runway during landing and crashed into the rice fields, catching fire and burning.

### People Sitting in the House, Disaster Comes from the Sky: Four Residents of Zhangjiazhai Killed or Injured

Two houses in Zhangjiazhai were destroyed, and the roof beams were knocked away several feet away. Although the two houses had been built for several years, the nearby villagers still called them "new houses." The owner of the house, Zhang Guoye, works at the telegraph office and is currently in Nanjing. His wife, Zhang Qunxian, died on the spot. The villagers also called Zhang Qunxian "the new bride," although she had already given birth to three children. Zhang Yuezhi, 11, and Zhang Xinzhi, 9, were seriously injured and have been sent to the hospital. Zhang Lindi, 8, was fortunately only slightly scratched. Zhang Guoye's old mother, Zhang Lu, was also seriously injured and has been sent to the hospital.

Fortunately, a nearby tiled house adjacent to the destroyed houses was not affected. According to the people in the house, at around 6 o'clock the night before, they were having dinner when they heard two cracking sounds, followed by a loud boom, a flash of light, like a bomb had landed. The foundation of the house also shook. The plane crashed and caught fire. They tried their best to put out the fire, but because the gasoline was burning fiercely, they could only remove the straw next to the door and pour the feces from the manure tank. At the same time, the American soldiers stationed at Jiangwan Airport also rushed to the rescue, and the fire was prevented from spreading, but the embers did not stop until dawn.

All eleven passengers, pilots, and radio operators on the plane were killed.

Regarding the aftermath of the Central Air Transport Corporation Flight 48 accident, Wu Lieqi, secretary of the Flight Crew, led a team of senior officials from the Field Operations Section, General Affairs Section, and Vehicle Dispatch Section to the accident site at 8 a.m. yesterday to transport the bodies of the victims to the China Funeral Parlor to perform injections and cleaning. Soon after, China National Aviation Corporation also sent the victims of the company's accident to the China Funeral Parlor. Because there were many bodies to be prepared, Central Air Transport Corporation was afraid that the funeral parlor would be too busy to cope with it, so they specially moved the bodies to the Central Funeral Parlor on Gordon Road, Mabai Road, after 7 p.m. The coffin will be sealed today. It is said that most of the victims have been identified by their families.

### A Shocking Scene by the River Pagoda Temple, The Site of the Flight 115 Accident: The Plane Was Destroyed, People Died, a Tragic Sight Everywhere; Wind and Rain All Night, Most of the Bodies Were Icy and Hard

China National Aviation Corporation Flight 115 from Chongqing to Shanghai crashed in a pond to the right of the Heta Temple (River Pagoda Temple) in Qian San Road (from Qianliang Temple to Sanlintang) near the No. 3 bridge on the Shanghai-Minhang Highway. The reporter drove to the area in the wind and rain yesterday morning for an inspection. After traveling south for several kilometers past the Shanghai Provincial High School, there was a road that only allowed a Jeep to pass, leading to the Heta Temple. The temple is near the Huangpu River, about four li (Chinese mile) away from the highway. From the car, one could see the silver-white wreckage of Flight 115. Upon arriving at the temple, the first thing that caught the eye was a heartbreaking sight: twenty-nine bodies of male and female passengers, large and small, were lined up by the small stream in front of the temple. The clothes on the bodies were still intact, but after being exposed to the wind and rain all night, the bodies were icy and hard. The elbows of five of the bodies were bent upwards towards the sky, like a statue. One corpse had a broken skull with brain matter flowing out, another had a foot severed, and several had blood stains on their faces, but most did not have obvious injuries. According to nearby villagers, all the bodies were fished out of the small pond next to the Heta Temple, so some of the deceased must have jumped out of the cabin and drowned in the pond as the plane was about to crash. It is also said that three people were still breathing when they were rescued last night, but because it was midnight and transportation was inconvenient, there was no way to rescue them, so they soon died.

### A Love Letter: People Are Gone, But Belongings Remain

Flight 115 was destroyed in the small pond surrounding the Heta Temple. The nose of the plane was cut off, the right wing was broken, and the tail was split, but the fuselage was still intact. Its landing state was completely like a normal stop. The western half of the Heta Temple was destroyed, with rubble everywhere. A clay sculpture of a "bailiff" in the temple had fallen to the ground, but the temple god in the main hall was still sitting upright unscathed. The open space behind the temple faced the wreckage of the plane. Fragments of documents and papers were scattered all over the ground. Business cards and blank checks were found at the cut-off point of the plane's nose. The reporter also picked up a "love letter" stained with mud, dated the 23rd of this month, which was probably written by a female passenger on the plane but not sent. It read, "My dear [omitted], the departure date cannot be decided, it's really frustrating... Your [omitted]." It was heartbreaking to read. Broken clothes were still hanging on the branches of trees in the open space. The remaining suitcases and other items on the plane were being cleaned up and piled up on the lawn in front of the temple by China National Aviation Corporation personnel.

### Loud Noise, Sky-High Flames: Elementary School Principal Escapes Death

Although the Heta Temple was severely damaged, fortunately there were no casualties. However, Sun Jianjin, the principal of the private Huadong Elementary School in the village, escaped death. Principal Sun stayed in the western part of the main hall of the temple every night. At around 8 o'clock the night before, he was sound asleep when he suddenly heard a loud noise and woke up from his dream. The bed curtain had fallen down, and he felt a heavy object pressing on his feet. In a hurry, he poked his head out and saw flames reaching the sky. At the time, he never thought that it was a plane crash, but thought that it was a fire caused by lightning, so he hurriedly got out of bed, put on his clothes, and ran out. At this time, he was flustered and confused, and the east hall had been destroyed, so he could not identify the direction. Later, he calmed down a little and went around the bamboo garden behind the temple to the neighboring houses, where he joined the villagers in sounding gongs to call for help. Principal Sun smiled when he talked to the reporter about the situation at the time, and said, "Fortunately, I always sleep with my head facing east and my feet facing west, otherwise my head would have been crushed, and I would have died."

### Rain Fell on the Road: Travelers' Souls Were Broken

When the reporters and others were inspecting the surrounding area, two family members of the victims (male) came to identify the bodies. Obviously, the relatives they were looking for were among the corpses, so their eyes were filled with tears. The county government had also sent people to deal with the situation at this time, but the bodies had not been moved by the time the reporter left (2 p.m.). At this time, two official cars were parked by the road. A woman in one of the cars looked around with teary eyes and opened the car door to ask in the rain when she saw the reporters. She claimed to be the wife of Le Zuolin, the general manager of Qinghua Pigment Company. Her husband had called and said that he was taking China National Aviation Corporation Flight 115 to Shanghai. This morning, after learning about the plane crash, she had inquired at various hospitals but had not found him. She feared that he had died. She was sobbing as she spoke.

In addition, the China National Aviation Corporation personnel who were taking care of the scene yesterday prohibited reporters from taking photos of the corpses. A foreign employee even held an iron bar and tried to rush towards a newspaper photographer, which caused public outrage and almost led to an incident.

### Fifteen People Under Treatment at Zhongshan Hospital, Yu Peng Has Died, Zhang Chunhua and Xue Jinfan Are the Least Injured

[Our Reporter] At 3:30 p.m. yesterday, Dr. C.F. Hoey, the medical director of China National Aviation Corporation, went to Zhongshan Hospital to visit the injured passengers who were rescued from the company's two ill-fated planes. China National Aviation Corporation sent three batches of injured people to the hospital from the night before the accident until yesterday morning, a total of fifteen people. The first batch of seven people: Yu Peng (seriously injured), Zhao Jixing (male), kidney rupture, bleeding in urine, skull fracture, in a coma. Liu Tengxiang (male), concussion, Chen Ar-er (male), right leg broken, Zhang Qiyun (female), injured head and left leg, Min Wanzhen (female), injured head and knees, unnamed (female), has been in a coma since being sent to the hospital. The second batch of four people: Zhang Chunhua (male), left foot tibia and fibula broken, Wu Rongbing (male), left ulna broken, Xue Jinfan (male), injured arm, relatively slightly injured, Preus (male, the captain of Flight 115), seriously injured head and face, in a coma. There were also two unnamed children, one of whom died at 6:50 p.m. yesterday, less than one year old. The other had both legs broken, about one year old. The third batch of two people: Wang Xiaode (male, the radio operator of Flight 115), knee joint dislocation, femur, tibia, and fibula broken in four places, brain laceration, very serious condition, Xu Weilong (male), injured head and face.

Among the aforementioned fifteen injured people, Yu Peng died yesterday morning. The unnamed female and Wang Xiaode also became terminally ill by last night due to their serious injuries. The rest are doing well. Among them, Zhang Chunhua and Xue Jinfan, passengers on Flight 115, were the least injured. They were even allowed by the doctor to have a brief conversation with the reporter.

Zhang Chunhua is a Pingju (Peking Opera) actor who plays the role of a martial clown. Only his right ear and left heel were slightly injured. He is currently staying in a second-class ward on the second floor. A female friend surnamed Zhou was comforting him. Zhang performed with Li Shaochun at the Hankou Grand Theater until the 16th. He could have returned to Shanghai with Li at the same time, but the stage had not been able to pay Zhang's remuneration on time, so he was delayed until the 25th to start. He originally planned to rest for a while after arriving in Shanghai and then immediately go to Tianjin to perform, but he happened to encounter the accident.

According to Zhang, the plane arrived over Shanghai at around 7 o'clock, and he was asleep. When he was awakened by the extreme impact, the plane had already crashed. Zhang woke up from the coma and did not know that he had been injured. When he tried to stand up, he realized that his left leg was broken. He rolled around the plane until someone came to rescue him after midnight.

Xue Jinfan is a department store merchant who came to Shanghai from Chongqing to purchase goods. There were six partners traveling with him, but only Xue survived. Xue was sitting in the middle seat of the plane. He only knew that the plane could not land, but he did not expect anything else. When the plane suddenly crashed, he became unconscious. When he woke up, he saw that he had been thrown out of the plane and was lying on the river beach. There was a woman next to him. Xue himself had the ability to help others and tried to help her, but he knew that she was a corpse. At this time, he suddenly realized that he himself had been injured and fell to the ground due to exhaustion. After being rescued to the hospital, his condition has been very good, and relatives and friends have visited him several times.

The condition of Preus, the American pilot of Flight 115, is quite serious. When Dr. Hoey of China National Aviation Corporation went into the room to visit him, he was still unable to speak. His head, cheeks, and other parts were bandaged with gauze and silk ribbons. His left leg was broken. Dr. Hoey instructed the doctors in the hospital to move Preus to the best ward, hire a special nurse, and continuously transfuse blood when necessary, and use X-rays to examine his chest and abdomen for injuries. He also said that there was no problem with medical expenses, and everything would be paid by China National Aviation Corporation. If Preus can be rescued, he will probably be the only pilot saved from the three ill-fated planes.

### China National Aviation Corporation Announces Cause of Accident: Attempted Blind Landing Resulted in Tragic Crash; Total of Sixty Passengers on Both Planes

China National Aviation Corporation issued the following public announcement yesterday regarding the cause of the recent accident:

The loss of two passenger planes flying from Chongqing to Shanghai on the evening before last (December 25th) by China National Aviation Corporation is deeply regrettable. Aircraft No. 140, a C-47 model, piloted by J.M. Greenwood, co-piloted by Liu Linsen, and with radio operator Jin Keng accompanying, took off from Chongqing's Shanba Airport at 10:15 a.m., with planned stops in Wuchang and Nanjing. Aircraft No. 115, a C-46 model, piloted by R.B. Preus, co-piloted by Tan Xingzheng, and with radio operator Wang Xiaode accompanying, took off from Chongqing's Baishi Airport at 10:30 a.m., with a planned stop in Wuchang, and then flying directly to Shanghai. Both planes left Wuchang in succession, fifteen minutes apart. At that time,

the weather in both Nanjing and Shanghai was still suitable for landing. However, as they approached Nanjing, the weather in both Nanjing and Shanghai suddenly changed drastically. Because Wuchang Airport lacked night-flying equipment, it was impossible to return. Both Nanjing and Shanghai airports had night-flying equipment for nighttime landings, especially Jiangwan Airport, which had more comprehensive blind landing and night-flying equipment. Aircraft No. 140, which was originally scheduled to stop in Nanjing, attempted to land in Nanjing, but due to the weather, the airport was completely invisible. The pilot then continued to fly to Shanghai. Aircraft No. 115 arrived in Shanghai airspace at 5:30 p.m., and Aircraft No. 140 arrived an hour later. At that time, the weather in Shanghai was the same as in Nanjing.

Aircraft No. 140 first attempted to land at Jiangwan Airport using blind landing equipment. The pilot circled above the airport for over an hour and, after several attempts, found that the radio equipment on the plane was partially malfunctioning, making it impossible to use the blind landing system. Although they could communicate with the control tower, the power was too weak to establish contact with the blind landing equipment. After another hour of attempts, they were certain that landing at Jiangwan was impossible, leaving no other option than to fly to Longhua. However, when attempting to land at Longhua Airport, the visibility was still zero. After several attempts, they finally notified the control tower that the plane was out of fuel and had to make a forced landing. While attempting to correct the landing direction, the plane crashed at the southwestern end of the airport at 7:55 p.m. As for aircraft No.

115, after circling over Jiangwan, they were able to contact the blind landing equipment, but the connection was sometimes unclear. Under these circumstances, a safe landing was unlikely. Therefore, at around 9:00 p.m., they flew from Jiangwan to Longhua Airport. At this time, the weather had changed slightly, and visibility gradually improved. After repeated attempts to land, their last attempt was almost successful. They only needed to make one more circle to change direction when, unexpectedly, the plane crashed one mile southwest of the airport, at the Huangjiadu River Temple Pagoda. The cause of the crash is still unclear. Aircraft No. 115 circled over Jiangwan for three hours and thirty minutes. For the first two hours, Aircraft No. 140 and another China National Aviation Corporation plane were also in the air.

Aircraft No. 147

In addition, two other aircraft, China National Aviation Corporation's Aircraft No. 147, landed safely at Jiangwan Airport at 7:40 p.m. When Aircraft No. 140 was attempting to land at Longhua, executives and aviation personnel from China National Aviation Corporation were waiting at the airport. The airport's fire brigade, ambulances, and medical personnel were also summoned. The municipal police department was notified, and police and firefighters were dispatched to the scene in case of emergency, so that timely rescue could be provided when the accident occurred. As for Aircraft No. 115, news of the accident was received about an hour after contact was lost. At that time, the U.S. military and U.S. Navy assisted in the search, and the water police and U.S. Navy dispatched multiple boats.

Reconnaissance along the River

Aircraft No. 140 carried 27 passengers and 3 crew members. Aircraft No. 115 carried 33 passengers and 3 crew members. The injured have all been sent to hospitals. Unfortunately, the number of fatalities is quite high. The names of the passengers and other detailed information will be disclosed after further investigation.

### Newlywed Couple Die Together; National Assembly Representative Loses Wife

In the International Funeral Home, the deceased lie quietly, many of their bodies covered in flowers. In the China Funeral Home, the situation is different. The bodies are piled together, blood, mud, and rain staining their clothes beyond recognition. The grieving families sometimes can only identify their relatives by a single high-heeled shoe! The cries are earth-shattering, a tragic sight to behold.

Xia Changjun, a victim from the Central Aircraft, was a grain specialist from Shao County. He and his wife, Xia Wu Shuzhen, died together. Xia Changjun's death was particularly gruesome, with one leg severed. Yang Xizhi, the former special commissioner of grain administration, personally identified the body yesterday. Relatives of Mrs. Xia fainted from grief upon seeing her remains! The Xia couple had only married in May of this year. Unexpectedly, they became a tragic pair in less than a year! Liu Linsen, the co-pilot of the Central Aircraft, also perished in the accident. He had only been engaged for two months. Yesterday, Liu's fiancée went to identify his body, a scene of utter desolation!

Zhao, a representative of the National Assembly from Liaoning Province in Shenyang, and his mother, Zhao Wang Yuxian, along with his son, Zhao Jixing, were flying from Chongqing to Nanjing to visit the representative. Due to the weather, they changed their flight to Shanghai, but unexpectedly met with this disaster, mother and son dying together. Zhao's second son, Zhongxing, has arrived at the International Funeral Home to identify the bodies and arrange the funeral. He has also urgently telegraphed Representative Zhao in Nanjing to come to Shanghai.

At the International Funeral Home, someone recognized a deceased person as their relative, Zhang Qiyun. However, Zhang Qiyun was resting peacefully in bed number 30 in room number six of Zhongshan Hospital. She could still speak and said that she was indeed Zhang Qiyun. It was later discovered that it was a misunderstanding.

The U.S. military police (MP) were driving a jeep rapidly through the wind and rain to take the injured to the hospital the night before. Unfortunately, the vehicle was going too fast and struck a pedestrian, Li Chen, injuring her head. As a result, she was sent to Zhongshan Hospital along with the accident victims.

At Zhongshan Hospital, two plane tickets were found next to the body of a victim. One ticket was in the name of Yu Peng, and the other was in the name of Zhang Zhenjiang, making it impossible to determine the victim's name.

Next to the wreckage of China National Aviation's Aircraft No. 115, rescuers picked up a little boy wearing a calico jacket. Thank goodness, he was not injured at all! When reporters arrived at Zhongshan Hospital, he had already been safely taken to the hospital and was asleep. He said his name was Wang Didi and that he was four years old. Who his parents are and where he came from are currently unknown. On Christmas Eve, he may have been a beloved and happy little angel—but now, he has become an orphan adrift in the world!

Wang Didi Survives the Disaster Unscathed

### Ministry of Communications Sends Personnel to Shanghai to Console Bereaved Families and Supervise Safety Measures at Both Companies

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] The Ministry of Communications is paying close attention to the accident and has dispatched Director Li Bohou of the Navigation Administration Department and Director Dai Anguo of the Civil Aviation Department to Shanghai as quickly as possible to console the injured passengers and the bereaved families, and to supervise both airlines to take urgent safety measures. During this winter season of ice and fog, all flights should be suspended when the weather is bad and visibility is poor to ensure safety.

### Aircraft No. 140 Collides with Aircraft on the Ground While Crashing

China National Aviation Corporation's Chongqing-Shanghai flight No. 140 crashed near the main runway of Longhua Airport. The wreckage was cleared by the company using a crane yesterday morning. The Red Cross ambulance No. 6, which was inadvertently overturned near the runway while transporting the injured and dead in the dark the night before, has also been towed away. Scattered aircraft parts, as well as piles of tattered clothes, shoes, and socks, can still be seen on the lawn where the plane crashed, with bloodstains blurring the scene. Some passengers on the plane were carrying Sichuan Guangju oranges, which now shared the same tragic fate as their owners, with orange peels scattered everywhere, yet to be cleaned up.

On the night of the accident, the plane soared over the city for two or three hours. Finally, running out of fuel, the nose of the plane plunged straight to the ground, hitting the wing of another plane parked there upon impact, before flipping over several times and being destroyed.

While the two planes were circling in the city's airspace, Wu Shi, the head of the company's aviation division, McDonnell, the chief pilot, Gao Dajing, the head of the business division, Wu Zhihong, the director of the Shanghai ticket office, as well as American director Shedivy and several senior pilots, were all waiting at the airport. Chief Pilot McDonnell personally directed operations from the control tower. Shen Desie, the general manager of the company, Mr. Lano of Pan American Airlines, and Dr. Salade also arrived successively to supervise the rescue efforts until dawn the next day.

### Shipyard Fire

[Report from this newspaper] A fire broke out in the carpentry workshop of the Jiangnan Shipyard in the Nanshi district at 10:15 last night. It burned for over two hours, destroying ten workshops. It is said that the fire was caused by an electrical short circuit.

### Smuggling and Resisting Arrest; All Stolen Goods Recovered

[Report from this newspaper] At 8:30 last night, a transport truck fully loaded with goods was speeding west on Weidemer Road in Jiangwan, in front of Fudan University, when it was spotted by a patrol team from the Xinshijie Police Station. The police immediately ordered the truck to stop for inspection. Unexpectedly, someone in uniform suddenly fired two shots at the police officers and continued to accelerate westward. The police officers returned fire with twelve shots, but were unable to intercept the truck. Afterwards, the police officers telegraphed the police station and learned that the truck belonged to the Gongda Motor Transport Company. Xiao Jun, a member of the second unit of the police station, along with plainclothes police officers Liu Renqian, Lu Wenxuan, and Shi Chenghou, went to the Gongda Motor Transport Company to investigate. They learned that the truck had indeed left the company at 5:55 p.m. on a trip to Jiangwan. They waited until 9:30 p.m. when the truck returned to the company, and the police officers detained the driver, Wang Zhengming, for questioning. According to Wang, shortly after leaving the transport company, five people in uniform boarded the truck and ordered him to drive straight to the vicinity of Jiangwan Airport, where they loaded twenty boxes of white paint and seven pieces of steel plate weighing five hundred pounds each. They then ordered him to drive back to Shanghai. When they reached the front of No. 19 Qufu Road, near Tiantong Road, they were seen by police officers who attempted to stop them. At that time, the two military officers sitting next to him, one of them took out a gun and forced him to continue driving. The other person fired a gun outside the vehicle. Later, the truck stopped in front of No. 19 Qufu Road, where there were already more than twenty people waiting. They unloaded all the goods from the truck and then allowed him to return. Based on this testimony, the police station immediately went to No. 19 Qufu Road. However, the criminals had already fled after hearing the news. The police only found all the stolen goods inside the building and arrested the wife of the store owner, Zhou Genbao, and brought her back to the police station. The investigation is still underway.

### President Song Summoned Heads of Cotton Textile Industry Yesterday to Discuss Measures to Curb Yarn and Cloth Price Hikes; Cease Distribution of Reprocessed Cotton Yarn, Transferring it to Suppress Market Prices; Requested Foreign Exchange to Purchase Raw Cotton, Half of the Finished Products Should Be Allocated to the Management Committee

President of the Executive Yuan, Song Ziwen, went to the Bank of China Building at around 9:00 a.m. yesterday to handle official business. At around 10:00 a.m., Mayor Wu Guozhen and leading figures from the Sixth District Machinery Cotton Textile Industry Association, including Wang Qiyu, Rong Hongyuan, Guo Dihuo, and Tang Xinghai, paid a joint visit. Song met with them, and the discussion lasted an hour. The content focused on decisions regarding suppressing yarn and cloth price hikes and increasing production. The principles can be divided into: (1) Ceasing the distribution of reprocessed cotton yarn and transferring the existing quantity to the Textile Management Committee for use in suppressing market prices at any time. (2) Private factories request foreign exchange to import raw cotton. After the finished products are manufactured, half of them should be allocated to the Management Committee for sale to the market, to suppress market price hikes, and a portion of them should be exported to earn foreign exchange. A draft plan will be prepared by the Textile Management Committee, reviewed by a small group, and then submitted to the general meeting for approval, to be implemented on a trial basis starting in January of next year. (3) It is hoped that private factories will do their best to promote the sale of domestic cotton to save foreign exchange. Subsequently, Lin Fengbao of the Central Bank also reported to Song on the fact that the Central Bank of Japan's sale of gold had been effective, reporting on the details. At 12:00, Song also met with financial figures Zhao Dihua, Xu Weiming, Hu Huichun, etc., to discuss matters. At that time, Song also invited Xu Weiming to lunch. He then returned to his office at around 2:00 p.m. After 4:00 p.m., Song summoned Shu Yunzhang of the Textile Construction Company and Yang Xiren of the Textile Management Committee. At around 6:00 p.m., he also met with Xu Jizhuang, the director of the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau, to discuss matters.

### In Light Rain, the Mayor Inspected Pudong; Inspected the Yangsi District and Investigated Households; Enquired About the Living Conditions of Shanty Towns in the Yangjing District

[Report from this newspaper] Mayor Wu, accompanied by Director of Civil Affairs Zhang Xiaosong and Chen Baotai, a member of the municipal party headquarters, took the municipal ferry across the river at Dongjiadu Pier at 2:00 p.m. yesterday, despite the rain, and traveled in three special vehicles to inspect the Yangsi District in Pudong. Accompanied by the district chief, Zhu Youguo, he visited Yangsi Middle School. Students were in class at the time. He then went to inspect the district's health sub-office, where the director, Tang Shenqi, reported on its work. The office was established three months ago and has achieved excellent results, but the start-up funds have not yet been received. The current equipment and furniture have been donated by local gentry Chen Tianxi. Mayor Wu also went to the Yangjing District, where he was accompanied by the district chief, Zhang Ruoxu, to inspect the shanty towns along Dongchang Road. The Mayor personally entered the dark shanty houses, inquiring about the lives of the village women and checking household registrations, which were accurate.

Although it was drizzling yesterday and the roads were muddy, the Mayor was detailed in his inquiries and investigated the household registrations in great detail. The local gentry, Chen Zixin, also provided tea and refreshments.

According to Qi Peiran, the head of the Yangsi District Branch in Pudong, the district has 102 administrative police officers and a security police squadron, so there is absolutely no worry about local security. The Mayor was very satisfied with the district's household registration work, and returned to the municipal government at around 5:00 p.m.

### Calculation of Some Property Tax and Construction Tax is Problematic; The Financial Committee of the Municipal Council Resolved to Request a Reply from the Municipal Government

[Report from this newspaper] The Finance Committee of the Municipal Council held its sixth meeting at the Hongqiao Club yesterday afternoon, continuing to discuss tax issues, with Hu Wenyuan, deputy director of the Finance Bureau, attending to provide explanations. The items discussed at the meeting included: (1) Regarding the Finance Bureau's "Implementation Measures for Collecting In-Kind Converted into National Currency for Farmland Tax in Fiscal Year 35" and "Provisional Measures for Temporary Clearance of Grain Registration When Collecting Farmland Tax," the council members Lu Shidao and Wang Weiyin were appointed to review them, and their review opinions were submitted to the municipal government for reference. Deputy Director Hu explained that the farmland grain registration in the city has always been controlled by clerks (commonly known as "land skin ghosts"). Currently, the bureau has dispatched personnel to clear them up according to the above measures. Since implementation, the results have been excellent, and there have been no cases of harassment. Collection can begin as early as February next spring.

(2) Citizens, the Chamber of Commerce, and candidate council members in the city have all proposed to the Municipal Council that the Finance Bureau's calculation of property tax and municipal construction tax for the autumn season in the city is not based on the rental value calculated by the former Public Concession in 1926, and requested that it be corrected. The committee decided to send this opinion to the municipal government for review. Deputy Director Hu also explained that the Slaughter Tax Law, the Banquet and Entertainment Tax Law, and the Property Tax Regulations have all been revised by the National Government and differ greatly from the current system. Based on the city's collection experience, the Finance Bureau feels that there are some aspects that are not entirely suitable for local conditions and has telegraphed the central government to request further revisions. It is also prepared to submit this to the second general meeting of the Municipal Council for study.

### To Improve Communication Between the Banks of Suzhou River, A Plan for the Construction of Several New Bridges

[Our Newspaper's Report] In the Puxi area of the city, the Suzhou River is a barrier in the middle, resulting in the formation of two districts, north and south of the river. East of Xizang Road, there are more bridges across the river, so north-south transportation is relatively convenient, and the Hongkou area is more prosperous. West of Xizang Road, there is only the Xinzha Bridge for crossing the river, so the Zhabei area is relatively deserted. Those traveling from Zhabei to Huxi and the southern city mostly cross the river along the bridges in the eastern district, which increases the traffic burden on the Huangpu district. The traffic on Nanjing Road and Zhongzheng Road is extremely congested, and this is one of the reasons for it.

Zhao Zukang, the director of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, in view of this, in addition to having drafted a transportation plan for the banks of the Suzhou River, preparing to implement it step by step, specially accompanied Lu Jifang, the director of the Road Department of the Bureau, and Zhu Guoxi, the director of the Structural Department, yesterday afternoon to conduct an on-site inspection, and closely studied the Bureau's near-term engineering plan to improve transportation between the north and south banks of the Suzhou River. It is reported that the plan includes the construction of bridges at Jiangxi Road, Hengfeng Road, Fujian Road, and Changshou Road, as well as bridge site issues, the renovation of the entire Suzhou Road surface, revetments, and the widening and renovation of Jiangxi Road, Chengdu Road, Huasheng Road, Hengfeng Road, Zhongzheng North Second Road, Changshou Road, and Guangzhao Road. The total cost of the plan is more than 9 billion yuan, which will soon be submitted to the Municipal Council for review. After the completion of this plan, the eight to nine thousand acres of land benefited in the Zhabei area, just considering the land value increase, could reach at least 40 to 50 billion yuan, which would greatly alleviate the traffic congestion in the Huangpu district.

Sufficient Stock, Store Sales Turn Slack, Rice Market Gradually Stabilizes; Oil Prices Also Plunge in a Straight Line Yesterday

[Our Newspaper's Report] The rice market stabilized yesterday. A total of 3,230 dan arrived in the northern city, and 5,328 dan arrived in the southern city. In terms of prices: In the southern city, under negotiation, there was only a slight black market for the cooked rice in the northern city. Initially, it was 67,000 yuan, and then it dropped to 65,000 yuan. The reason for the black market was the relatively small amount of goods arriving due to rain, and rumors of pulling boats to transport grain. The previous rumor that rice prices in the production area were higher than in the city was also true, but it is understood that the price increase in the production area was due to the stimulation of the Shanghai rice market turmoil, which is not a concern if the Shanghai rice price is stable. The estimated amount of rice stored by the people in the city is at least 300,000 dan, and the rice that the city government can control, including those in Shanghai and on the way, is almost no less than 2 million dan. With good distribution, it can supply the city for four or five months. The prospect of people's food is very optimistic.

Although transactions of northern japonica rice were rare, they secretly dropped by more than 1,000 yuan. Southern japonica rice was still supplied in large quantities, falling back by more than 2,000 yuan. Indica rice arrivals and sales were still few and far between, and both white yuan and yuan fell by 2,000 yuan. The situation tended to stop rising and turn downward.

Bean cakes had a weak appetite for both Taiwan and Shantou, returning to a low of 200 to 300 yuan. Flour also tended to be flat and tired, and unified flour returned to a small 300 to 500 yuan. Foreign flour was stable, and wheat bran also returned to a small 100 to 200 yuan. Yellow beans were still able to digest well on the local street, and oil mills' purchases were average, resulting in a squeeze of 500 yuan. Red beans were sold in large quantities, and the price rose by 1,000 yuan. Mung beans continued to be consumed in Southeast Asia, and the prices were tight, rising by more than 1,000 yuan. Corn purchases in Qingdao continued, and the price was stable. Broad beans were scarce and hard, and red sorghum was not seen to be prosperous. Wheat arrivals were not as good as sales, and it was still rising. Sesame seed station maintained its position. Raw peanuts’ digestion in the Guangzhou gang market turned weaker, and the local street was also average. High-quality goods returned to a small 1,000 yuan, while medium and low-quality goods fell by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan.

Also reported that since the gold and banknote market prices fluctuated in recent days, the prices of other goods have mostly risen with it, especially in terms of people's livelihood necessities, both rice and flour have exceeded the negotiated prices. The municipal authorities, recognizing that the situation is serious, have paid close attention to it and have sent cadres to the markets to secretly monitor them. If there are any off-market black market transactions, they will be severely punished. Therefore, the market disturbances in the two cities yesterday and today have gradually subsided. According to the person in charge of the Social Bureau, it was decided to convene a rice and flour price review meeting this week, and to make every effort to help dredge the source of materials, so as to balance supply and demand. At the same time, the supervision of sales in various markets will be strengthened to ensure that no materials flow into the black market. For legitimate merchants, in addition to providing reasonable profits, they will be guided into the right track at any time.

After 10 o'clock, the Central Bank distributed 36 strips at a price of 3.18 million, at which point the price was once seen at 3.2 million. Soon, the Central Bank rotated the pressure again, once again falling to within 3.1 million, but the selling wind was very temporary.

The bank also posted a notice at the entrance: It briefly stated: "The branch has recently been experiencing extremely tight silver. It is not easy to recover the released loans. It is forced to temporarily suspend the exchange, collect debts, and return deposits. It has also requested the head office to transfer funds for assistance. Once the deployment is in place, the original state will be restored immediately. All branch offices and sub-branches of the bank will continue to operate as usual. Notice is hereby given." It was found that the bank was founded in Chongqing in May of the 30th year of the Republic of China by Sun Linfang and others. The initial capital was 2 million yuan, and then the capital was increased three times in succession. By December of the 34th year of the Republic of China, the capital was increased to 100 million yuan. On March 26th of the 35th year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai line was established. On June 1st, the head office also moved to Shanghai to work. On June 10th, the Shanghai line officially opened and held business license No. 3204. Currently, in addition to the Chongqing head office, there are branches in Xi'an and Neijiang. In addition to the Nanjing Road branch in the city, there are also two sub-branches at 795 Nanjing West Road and 963 Linsen Middle Road. The current chairman and general manager is Sun Linfang, and the Shanghai line manager is Fan Yupan.

### Sichuan Banks Operate Stably, Rumors of Instability are Untrue

Recently, a major figure in the Sichuan silver industry told reporters that the recent rumors that Sichuan banks are unstable are not true. The branches of the Sichuan banks in Shanghai have their loans released annually by the head office. Therefore, at the end of the year, this portion of the loans only needs to be collected and returned to the head office. Therefore, there may be a tightening of the bank's silver, but there is no phenomenon of illiquidity. Also, the Sichuan banks' business has always been conservative and normal, and rarely goes beyond the scope of the bank's legitimate business. Therefore, in recent days, the daily exchange amount has been doubled in preparation to prevent any eventuality. The banks that were passively shaken in the Daily Report cannot be included in the Sichuan banks, because they were newly established by expatriates who resided in Chongqing during the Anti-Japanese War. It is a pity that the outside world does not understand the truth and confuses them.

### Asphalt Sales Launched, Market Prices Soar

### Person in Charge of China Textile Talks About Next Year's Production Increase Policy

According to the person in charge of China Textile Corporation, after the establishment of China Textile Corporation, through continuous efforts, it now owns more than 2 million spindles, which is one-half of the total number of spindles in the country. Among them, Shanghai is the center, accounting for more than 1.2 million spindles. Tianjin China Textile Corporation has a total of seven factories, which were reorganized from 16 enemy and puppet textile factories, with a total of 320,000 spindles. The second is Qingdao, with 300,000 spindles. So far, about six-tenths of the total have started work. China Textile Shanghai Company has a total of 19 textile printing and dyeing plants. Due to power restrictions, only more than 560,000 spindles have started work. The cotton production period is approaching, and the company has sent personnel to various cotton producing areas to purchase domestic cotton. According to estimates, the total number of domestic cotton purchased this season is about 5 million dan. In addition to supplying local needs, only about 1 million dan will flow to the market. The company's target for purchasing domestic cotton this period is 800,000 dan, but it is still less than half of the raw materials needed for production, so it still needs to purchase American cotton with foreign exchange. It is reported that the steps of China Textile's production increase plan for next year are (1) to purchase its own generators. It is now actively installing four small turbine generators in China Textile Factory No. 16, with a total power generation of 4,000 KVA, which is only enough to supply the factory's electricity needs. In the future, it will continue to contact the Executive Yuan Materials Supply Bureau to purchase generators for installation, (2) to collect as much domestic cotton as possible, save foreign exchange, and seek self-sufficiency in raw materials.

As a result, it fell slightly by 30 yuan compared to the previous close. Grades A and B fell by 120 yuan, and Unified Grade D and Unified Grade E each fell by 70 yuan. More than 4 million were transacted.

### Fundraising for Victory Bonds Account, Deadline is the End of This Year

The National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank recently received a letter from the Ministry of Finance, stating that the fundraising for the 31st and 32nd Allied Victory Bonds had already ended. However, the itemized expense receipts arranged by the agencies in various provinces and cities were not sent to the Ministry on time due to transportation obstacles, so the accounts for these types of funds could not be cleared. If there are still expense receipts for the 31st and 32nd Allied Victory Bonds, they must be sent to the Ministry by the end of this year. After the deadline, this account will be closed. It is understood that the Bureau has notified all entrusted banks to comply.

### Resources Committee Takes Over Coal Mines, Obtains Loans of 1.5 Billion, Fuel Panic in Beijing-Shanghai Area Can Be Relieved

The Board of Directors of the Four Joint Banks recently held a meeting and resolved to lend 1.5 billion yuan to the Shandong Luda, Yuesheng, and Boda coal mines taken over and operated by the Resources Committee to meet the urgent production needs of the mines. All the assets of the mines are used as collateral, and the operating income of each mine is used as repayment funds. The Bank of China and the Bank of Communications each bear half of the loan, with a term of six months, and are allowed to handle re-mortgaging at 70% to the Bank of China. It is reported that the scale of the mines is quite large, but the war caused extremely heavy damage. After the Resources Committee took over, it planned to purchase a large amount of equipment and materials, and the need for funds was urgent, so it borrowed a large amount of money from the Four Joint Banks. The production volume of the mines can reach as high as 50,000 tons of coal per month, which will be of great benefit to solving the fuel panic in the Beijing-Shanghai area in the future.

### Chaoqing Falls, Taiwan Sugar Rises

Semi-gloss goods prices were still firm. No. 150 shiny and semi-gloss goods saw high prices, because goods were scarce, speculative hoarding and raising prices were unavoidable.

Huashi crepe, because of very strong demand, was still shouted at 700 yuan, and the minimum transaction was 670 yuan.

### Caustic Soda Supply Cannot Meet Demand

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Social Affairs Bureau has considered replacing caustic soda with soda ash because the supply of caustic soda in the city cannot meet demand, and has asked the Yongli Chemical Company to provide detailed reports on related issues for research reference. It is reported that the British company, because the quantity of alkali supplied to various chemical plants is very large, it is difficult to make any further contributions. The import quantity of caustic soda is very small. Britain was originally a major producing country, but now, due to the coal shortage, the production of alkali is far less than before, and exports have sharply reduced. The United States, because of its small domestic production volume, cannot export. This is the main reason for the current shortage of caustic soda in our country.

### Seafood Transportation Difficulties, Please Ask the Transportation Management Committee to Handle Leniently

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Import and Export Industry Seafood Group Meeting has been held. The industry believes that seafood comes from Southeast Asia, and the capacity of Indian ports is not very large, so European ships passing through India often do not stop, resulting in the fact that as of November 17, there is still a lot of seafood in India that has not been shipped. Moreover, foreign seafood is listed as a prohibited import, resulting in a sharp drop in the selling price of seafood in India, and importers have suffered heavy losses, making it difficult to advance or retreat. After this meeting, it was decided to submit a request to the Transportation Management Committee to consider the special difficulties in transportation faced by the industry and handle it leniently. It is also learned that there are a large number of import applications for goods ordered before the announcement of the new import and export order, but the manpower of the Transportation Management Committee is insufficient, and very few import licenses have been issued, which also makes importers feel quite anxious.

### Cigarette Industry Faces Crisis, Costs and Tax Rates Too High, Important Meeting to be Convened

According to a person in charge of the Yizhong Cigarette and Tobacco Factory in this city, since a large number of American cigarettes have been imported into our country, the domestic cigarette industry has been in decline. Although the production and sales of domestic cigarettes are not as good as those of American cigarettes, the main reason is that the costs and tax rates are too high. Among the costs, labor is the largest, especially the year-end bonus issue, which makes major cigarette factories feel difficult. As for the tax rate, it has reached 100%, and there is talk that the tax bureau will adjust it again. In order to solve the above difficulties, the Cigarette Industry Association has decided to hold an emergency meeting of all members at the Association at 3:00 PM today. It is hoped that a proper solution can be discussed for the year-end bonus issue for workers. It is said that many of the city's 86 cigarette factories are unable to operate. The city's cigarette industry has more than 30,000 workers. For the sake of themselves and others, the Cigarette Industry Association is constantly doing everything possible to overcome the current difficulties, so as to avoid increasing unemployment among workers. As for the tax issue, the Association will send representatives Bao Gengsheng, Jin Yigeng, Shen Kunsan, Li Zaitang, Zhang Yuwen, and six others to Beijing tomorrow to petition the Taxation Administration, requesting a temporary exemption from adjusting the tax rate.

### Green Tea Market is Relatively Good

New Qihong is quiet. High-grade aged Qimen, although British export firms are coming in, it is a pity that goods are scarce and supply is lacking. As for green teas such as Chouzhen and Zhenmei, since the business authorities of the Central Bank reached an agreement with the French economic delegation for several hundred tons a few days ago, and they have also designated shipment to areas such as Africa's Gabon, several export firms that have taken on the contracts are still actively buying. In terms of selling prices, those in possession of goods are taking the opportunity to raise prices, and most are better than before. However, new Chouzhen and new Zhenmei and other varieties have already reached their peak and cannot advance further. They can only be stable.

### Silk Yarn Fabrics are Firm

Silk yarn fabrics such as yarn-backed satin, electric light satin, Ma Zong sleeves, Xi Hua cloth, lining cloth, silk-light feathers, black charcoal lining, Faci lining, horsetail inch and rainproof cloth have all been trending firm recently, and are much better than woolen fabrics and wool fabrics. The factories weave less, and no goods arrive from abroad. In addition to summer, street customers generally use these products. Due to various environmental factors, and the end of the year having arrived, many factories have stopped manufacturing. Also, there are not many retailers of these silk yarn fabrics lining cloth, so all transactions are much more real than woolen fabrics. Yesterday, in the tea parties and markets, rainproof cloth and Ma Zong sleeves were the most popular, followed by black charcoal lining and sleeves yarn flower cloth, and then yarn-backed satin silk-light feather silk.

Dear attendees of the International Cultural Cooperation Association, I hope to promote international cultural exchange in order to enhance sympathy and mutual assistance, and to maintain the collective security of mankind, which is the common belief of all nations in the world today. Our country's position is closely related to the peace of the East and the world, and is of great importance. Communicating culture should be taken as a matter of utmost urgency. The establishment of your association today has profound meaning in the cultural history of the future. In the past 30 years, world academic thought and scientific inventions have made unprecedented progress. It is necessary to catch up quickly and without stopping, so as to avoid being left behind, competing without a strategy. Our traditional culture is long and lasting, and the thoughts of the sages are broad, profound and subtle. The relics of ancient cultural relics are also extremely comprehensive and rich, and should be promoted and developed, so as to achieve the effect of pushing oneself and others to be inseparable. For the advantages of the cultures of various nations, we should choose the strengths of all to learn from the mistakes of others. Only in this way can we converge the sources of Eastern and Western cultures and make a powerful contribution to all mankind in the new era. Due to the high level of scientific development, the distance between nations is getting closer, diplomatic relations are becoming more frequent, and cultural relations are becoming closer. How to seek reconciliation and cooperation, and consider the similarities and differences, in order to enhance the friendly spirit between nations, is the mission entrusted to all of you today. You are cultural pioneers and elites in the academic world, and your association is a new and new organization in the cultural circles of our country. You must have grand words and unique insights, and give full play to them, in order to promote world harmony with cultural power. On the occasion of this grand meeting, I would like to offer you this meaning and hope to encourage each other.

Following this, Mr. Gu Shusen reported, stating roughly that the "National Standard Textbooks" originated before the war. The Ministry of Education only considered them a standard version and did not refer to them as "National Standard Textbooks." The term "National Standard Textbooks" was actually coined by outsiders. At the time, only the Chinese language textbook for senior elementary schools was printed and distributed on a limited scale. However, with the outbreak of the War of Resistance, a plan was devised, based on national policy, to completely control the printing and distribution. During the war, seven publishing houses, including Commercial Press, Chung Hwa Book Company, Zhengzhong, World Book Company, Datong, Kaiming, and Wentong, were responsible for printing and distribution, each forming a "Seven-Company Alliance." After the victory, four more publishing houses were added: Children's Press, Culture Press, Independent Press, and Victory Press, effectively opening it up to an "Eleven-Company Alliance." The Ministry of Education, due to proposals from the Political Council, once advocated for free opening, but due to various factors, a thorough and appropriate plan is still being carefully considered. Later, Mr. Chen Xiqin raised three questions: (1) Textbook editing issues: the advantages of National Standard Textbooks versus approved textbooks; (2) Textbook distribution issues: the importance of free and open systems versus the implementation of control; (3) Textbook content issues: a review of the current curriculum standards. Each expert expressed their views, leading to lively discussions until past 11:00 PM before the meeting adjourned.

Another report: Before the symposium last night, Mr. Chen Heqin hosted two banquets to welcome the renowned educator Zheng Xiaocang, who recently returned from the United States. During the banquet, he elaborated extensively on current university education issues. Mr. Zheng advocated that universities should not operate behind closed doors in the future but should open their doors and connect with the public. His words were very insightful. After the banquet, Mr. Zheng attended the symposium to participate in the discussion of textbook issues.

### Municipal Government Departmental Basketball Tournament: Elimination Games Begin Tonight; Accounting and Personnel Departments Win Yesterday

[Our Newspaper's Report] The second act of the Municipal Government Departmental Cup Basketball Tournament took place last night. In the first game, the Personnel Department defeated the General Affairs Department 38-21. In the second game, which was originally scheduled to be the Civil Affairs Department against the Accounting Department, it was changed because player number 44 of the Civil Affairs Department did not have an employee certificate the night before, which was not in compliance with the regulations. After a meeting of all team captains, with Chief Referee Shao Rugan also present, it was decided that the previous game between the Civil Affairs Department and the Secretariat would be forfeited by the Civil Affairs Department. Therefore, the second game was temporarily changed to the Secretariat against the Accounting Department. The Accounting Department won 53-35. Wang Weijun of the Secretariat still scored more than 20 points, but it was of no avail. The elimination games begin tonight. The schedule is as follows:

### Jingwu Cup Table Tennis Finals Begin Yesterday

[Our Newspaper's Report] The finals of the Jingwu Cup 5th All-Shanghai Individual Table Tennis Championship, involving the top two players from each of the five groups, were held yesterday at 7:00 PM in the gymnasium on the fourth floor of the Cishu Building. The referees were Chen Linsheng and Chen Limao, and the inspector was Dai Yongquan. There were six groups of matches. About 300 spectators were present. The venue was small and could not accommodate everyone, and more than 100 people were kept out, making it a very popular event.

In the first group, Wang Youxin played against Fan Liangji. Wang was considered the most likely champion of this year's tournament, while Fan was an unexpected dark horse. Therefore, the difference in skill was significant, and Fan was easily defeated by Wang. In the second group, Zhang Fuwei played against Chen Xingquan. The match was quite tense. Zhang narrowly won the fifth game at 9-9, thanks to a lucky spin serve. Although Chen lost, he still impressed. In the third group, Yang Kaiyun played steadily and defeated Hu Yiping with ease. In the fourth group, Shui Hangao started strong but then declined. Each player won one game. Shui was leading 8-3 in the third game, but he was taken advantage of due to his carelessness. Hangao's skills were originally strong, but it was a pity that he often lacked concentration. In the fifth group, Chen Zengliang lost 3-0. In the last group, Chen Xingquan won the first game against Wang Youxin. Youxin then fought back and played very intensely and excitingly, ultimately winning 3-1. Xingquan had both offense and defense last night, and his spirit was also good. The results of each group are as follows:

Group 1: Wang Youxin defeated Fan Liangji 3-0

Group 2: Zhang Fuwei defeated Chen Xingquan 3-2

Group 3: Yang Kaiyun defeated Hu Yiping 3-1

Group 4: Li Zhen defeated Shui Hangao 3-1

Group 5: Zhang Shanda defeated Chen Zengliang 3-1

Group 6: Wang Youxin defeated Chen Xingquan 3-1

Tonight's matches will be moved to the Jingwu General Association Auditorium at Jibin Bridge on North Sichuan Road due to the small venue. The matches will start at 7:30 PM. Players and all personnel with responsibilities should gather at the Guanwu Association on the third floor of the Cishu Building before 7:00 PM. The association will provide transportation. The schedule for tonight's matches is as follows:

(1) Zhang Fuwei vs. Fan Liangji, (2) Yang Kaiyun vs. Chen Xing, (3) Li Zhen vs. Hu Yiping, (4) Zhang Shanda vs. Shui Hangao, (5) Wang Youxin vs. Chen Zengliang, (6) Zhang Fuwei vs. Hu Yiping.

### Davis Cup Finals Day 1: US Wins Both Singles Matches; Shroude Defeats Bromwich; Australian Ace's Crushing Defeat a Big Surprise

[Agence France-Presse, Melbourne, 26th] The Davis Cup finals were held here today. The sky was overcast and the weather was sultry. No fewer than 14,000 fans came to watch. At 1:30 PM, the players from the US and Australia entered the arena. The band played the Australian and American national anthems. Brock, chairman of the Australian Lawn Tennis Association, gave a speech, recalling the contributions of Davis, the donor of the cup. The whole audience observed a minute of silence. The opening ceremony was completed, and the competition continued immediately. In the first group, Australia's Bromwich played against the US's Shroude. Bromwich was an Australian national player and was expected to win, but he lost unexpectedly. The score was 3-6, 6-1, 6-2, 0-6, 6-3. At the beginning of the match, Bromwich served first and everything went smoothly. He won the first set in 23 minutes. Shroude emerged in the second set and gave a brilliant performance, which was unprecedented. Although the next three sets became a battle of attrition, both sides used long shots and never volleyed. In the second group, the US's Kramo played against Australia's Hansu Pierce. Kramo was more skilled and won 8-6, 6-2, 9-7. According to the results of today's two matches, the Davis Cup is implicitly in the hands of the United States, because Kramo's match against Pierce on the 28th will be an easy victory. The United States will have won three of the five matches. Although the results of the remaining singles and doubles matches are difficult to predict, they are no longer relevant to the overall victory.

[Associated Press, Melbourne, 26th] The Davis Cup tennis finals were held today on the tennis court at the Kooyong Sports Ground. The 14,500 seats in the sports ground were packed to the brim during today's competition, making it one of the days with the largest audience in Davis Cup history.

### A Record of Vaulting Horses at the Golden Lock Pass

— A Special Dispatch from Xi'an on the 8th by Air, Our Correspondent Shao Shenzhi

I arrived in Yao County late at night. Although there were small shops outside the city, lodging was impossible, and it was necessary to knock on the gate to enter. At this time, the sky was as black as ink, one could not see one's hand in front of one's face, the desolate wilderness was plunged into night, and only the sound of dogs barking in the cold could be heard in the fields.

Yao County city is built alongside the Qi River, with very high walls and battlements. To enter the city, one must cross the Qi River, and there is also a palisade gate on this bank. To knock on the city gate, one must first knock on the palisade gate. The so-called fortified line is only a little over ten li from the city. In the morning, in Sanyuan, someone in the army told me, "When you get to Yao County, you may still hear gunfire. Just now there was a phone call saying that the Communist army is attacking the Datong line." Now I have arrived at this "important place," and it is already late at night. I expected it to be heavily guarded, so I planned how to "earn" my way through the gate. I draped a woolen blanket over my shoulders and used a flashlight to explore the way forward.

Earning Entry to Yao Gate at Night - Palisade Gate Opened Under Red-Tasseled Spears

After walking for a while, I heard a loud challenge for the password in the darkness. I shined the flashlight over and saw it was a red-tasseled spear, wielded by a member of the civilian self-defense force dressed in black. He stood with his spear across the palisade gate, blocking the way. I explained where I was coming from and that I needed to enter the city. The red-tasseled spear replied, "This palisade gate is locked. Go look to the north." So I walked north for a while and encountered another red-tasseled spear. I thought that if this one was also locked, I would have to find a way to get him to unlock it. Unexpectedly, the palisade gate was ajar. I exchanged a few brief words with the red-tasseled spear. Upon hearing that I was from Sanyuan, he opened the gate without hesitation.

I crossed the Qi River on a flat stone bridge, then climbed a very steep, long slope. At the top of the slope was the city gate, bolted tightly shut. After calling out, a head emerged from the crack in the gate and spoke to me. If I told him I was a reporter from Shanghai, he would not understand and would not open the gate. So I told him I was from the commissioner's office here, returning to the city from Sanyuan on urgent official business. It did not seem as heavily guarded as I had imagined. While I was negotiating, two soldiers came up behind me. They took my place and spoke to the head in a commanding tone, ordering him to open the gate. The gate gradually opened, and I saw that the head belonged to a soldier armed with a loaded gun.

We quickly entered the gate. The city was completely dark and as silent as death. Along the way, at street corners and alleyways, we encountered many more red-tasseled spears. With the help of a soldier, I managed to get someone to open the door of a bathhouse that also served as a hotel. The owner was sleepy-eyed and made hissing noises between his teeth as he made up a bed and brewed tea for me. Looking at the state of this hotel, I understood the poverty of social life in Yao County, the so-called "gateway to northern Shaanxi." The water was salty, the bedding was black, and the kang was cold. Coupled with the snowy weather, it added to the desolation.

During the Song Dynasty, Generals Han Qi and Fan Zhongyan established their headquarters in Yan'an to defend against the three northern tribes. The so-called Hundred and Two Qin Passes, of which the Golden Lock Pass on the Cheng-Yu Road was one, were used to defend the border. Defending the border outside the Hundred and Two Qin Passes was a life of distant garrison. When the situation was unfavorable, Fan Zhongyan established his headquarters in Yao County, then called Yao Prefecture, within the pass. "Old Master Fan had tens of thousands of soldiers in his belly," and the people of Yao County greatly admired Fan Zhongyan. The current county government is located where he established his headquarters. The place where this famous general of the western frontier held court and reviewed his troops still exists, now with a plaque that reads "Jing Fan Tang," which has become the county government's courtroom. The courtyard is narrow and crowded, with an old cypress tree. The light is dim, and it faces the drum tower in the center of the city, which is only a hundred paces away.

It makes one feel the atmosphere of a border town in the past, as if one can hear the sound of metal clashing and horses galloping.

However, Yao County is in Guanzhong, not a border town of the Han or Tang dynasties, but during the Eastern Han Dynasty, there were also Western Qiang tribes, and the entire Guanzhong region was considered a border area. A border town in the heartland, times have changed and landscapes have shifted, and thousands of years have unknowingly passed. Outside the city, the Qi and Ju Rivers flow murmuring, telling of the vicissitudes of life. It has always been "far" from Chang'an. Although it is now connected by railway, transportation is still difficult. The people of Yao County ultimately look back to the past, believing in myths and legends.

### City of Myths

Yao County also has a "forest" of steles, a collection of more than sixty stone tablets by a dedicated individual, housed in a solitary, dark, and dimly lit building, like a cave. Among them are Northern Wei Dynasty votive inscriptions, with bizarre and unrestrained strokes, unlike the Longmen Grottoes, which still have some elegant and graceful pieces. However, there are two extremely complete "Thousand Buddha" steles. One cannot compare these to the scale of Yungang or Dunhuang, but they are carved neatly and meticulously. The thousands of identical bas-relief Buddha images equally demonstrate the depth of Buddhist culture and the surging tide of thought. In addition, there are several Sixth Dynasty stone Buddhas with broken legs and feet. There are also more than a dozen ragged People's Republic of China infantrymen, looking like beggars. Some of them, like the Sixth Dynasty stone Buddhas, sit at the base of the wall in front of the solitary building, watching the red-tasseled spears drilling on a large parade ground, chanting "one, two, three, four." Others pile up dead branches and yellow leaves next to the Wei stele, burning them for warmth, the smoke stinging the eyes, nose, and throat. I squeezed into this small house that had become a smoke-filled cave, and with tears in my eyes, I finished looking at the steles and stone Buddhas with their bizarre strokes. This group of living stone Buddhas stood up and said to me:

"What should we do? Officer." I also didn't know what to do. After talking with them, they all began to complain endlessly. They said that they were originally from the 22nd Army, stationed in Toulin, because "the Eighth Route Army attacked us" and they were captured. "So many Eighth Route Army soldiers came! How could we not be defeated?" I said, didn't Xi'an send troops to rescue you? "That was after we surrendered that they came to rescue us!" They said, "The Eighth Route Army said to us: Why are you fighting? You were defeated before the rescue troops arrived. If you are willing to join the Eighth Route Army, stay here. If you are not willing, we will send you back. We don't want to join. They sent us here all the way, and they let us eat our fill. But when we got here, the county government only gives each person two steamed buns a day. How can we eat our fill? They still don't trust us. It's cold!"

So that was it. No wonder they were asking this "officer" what to do. They wear their suspicions on their sleeves, burdened with two steamed buns, unsure if it is relief or punishment. I asked around for them in this small town, but I couldn't find a solution. It seemed the solution had already been decided: inaction and letting nature take its course.

The people of Yao County consider themselves to live in the middle of a boat. The Northwest lacks water, so they imagine that the place where they live is a boat. They say with reason: Look, there is the Ju River and the Qi River, the county seat is like a boat floating in the middle. In some unknown era, a well was dug in the county government, and the boat leaked. Yao County was flooded, so they quickly filled it in and cast an iron ox to weigh down the boat, so that it would not sway in the water and that they can live in peace. I indeed saw an iron ox. This has more practical meaning than the ark mentioned in the Old Testament. They also boast of the Tang Dynasty calligrapher Liu Gongquan and the Sui Dynasty scholar Sun Simiao, whom the people of northern Shaanxi piously worship as the Medicine King. The Liu family north of the city was originally the hometown of Liu Gongquan, and this place name has been preserved from the Tang Dynasty until now.

Heading north from Sanyuan, the terrain continues to rise. From afar, it looks like a mountain, but climbing to the top of the mountain, it turns out to be a plain. Looking at the mountains further away, climbing them again, one finds another plain. There is a feeling of strength and ruggedness. This is the characteristic of the Qin-Long Plateau. The place names in this area are "something Yuan, something Yuan". The widespread use of the word "Yuan" began in Qin. South of Chang'an is Leyou Yuan, which in ancient Chinese literature represented idyllic scenery. But here, "Yuan" refers to a village or farmland, the edge of the Guanzhong Plain area. The Jinghui Canal area is blessed with natural advantages, and cotton can yield a world record of 120 catties per mu. But here, it is only 20 or 30 catties, a great difference, but still enough for a general standard. The soil is thin, the water conservancy is insufficient, and it depends on the heavens for harvest. There is a saying in Qin, "Eighty-three months of rain," meaning that every year it depends on rain in March, August, and the thirteenth month for a hopeful harvest. This saying is especially applicable to the barren areas north of Yao County.

These days the fortified line is tense. When I arrived, I didn't hear any gunfire. The commissioner and county magistrate shouted that it was terrible. When Commander-in-Chief of the Army Gu Zhutong came to Xi'an last time, he told them clearly: "If you lose the county government, defend the office. If you lose the office, defend the desk." This is the responsibility of the county magistrate. The inspection at the city gate is particularly strict.

A dilapidated county seat. The main streets were covered with horse and mule dung, allowed to dry easily, because harsh winter was about to descend. To the east of the city, there is a mountain named "Mount Wutai" to decorate the faith of the people of Yao County. Even more beautifully decorated is the Medicine King Temple, resplendent and magnificent. A wide road leads directly to the county seat, with incense burning throughout the year. The middle school students in the county seat kneel before the clay statues, shaking divination tubes, seeking prescriptions for someone in their family. Sun Simiao was undoubtedly a good doctor in the Tang Dynasty. According to the inscription on the Lingjing stele, Emperor Taizong once visited Sun and invited him to serve as an official, but Sun still lived in this hermitage. He praised Sun, saying, "If he does not become one of the three highest ministers, he will surely become a famous doctor." He was given the title "Perfected Man." Sun wrote the "Essential Recipes Worth a Thousand Gold," and Guo Si, a scholar of the Song Dynasty, had it engraved in Huazhou to widely disseminate it. Later, another set was engraved in the Taoist temple. These stone steles are as complete as before, because there are not many rubbings. The characters are clear, and they are all simple prescriptions. Among them, the "Maritime Prescription" stele contains Sun's pillow notes and health maintenance inscriptions, which are mostly in line with scientific principles. The main idea is quiet cultivation of life, revealing traces of the confluence of Confucian and Taoist thought. The backwardness of culture shows the strength of supernatural forces. The people of Yao County bring wine up the mountain to worship such temple gods, making the statues glow. Myths circulate, and life is impoverished. If someone were to close it down, they would undoubtedly be strongly opposed. Some people believe that it is better to be immersed in superstition than to be awakened; moreover, they do not know when they will find new salvation.

### Wheat Fields on the Plateau - Public and Private Wasteland Open for Cultivation

The Xiantong branch line ends in Yao County. There are coal-carrying trains from Yao County to the coal mine in Wulipu, five li south of Tongguan, which also sell passenger tickets. From Wulipu to Jin Suo Guan in Tongguan, one must take a horse-drawn carriage.

Galloping on horseback on the plateaus in this area, looking at the boundless world, the rising status of the Northwest, with the full development of the interior from the coast, frees it from labels of closure and backwardness.

On the road north from Yao County to Jinsuo Pass, the wheat is green, but there is still so much wasteland. The government encourages reclamation, but after a flurry of activity, only slogans remain: "Public and private wasteland, open for cultivation." It has no great effect, because reclamation requires capital and labor, and promoting a new movement also requires organization. Over the years, the main theme of the county governments has been handling military levies, and they have been maintaining old production methods. Tongguan County alone has built two hundred bunkers, but the entire county has a population of only 56,000. Yao County has a population of only 50,000, Sanyuan less than 100,000, and Yijun less than 40,000, all with frightening burdens.

A highway generally follows the Qi River north, with mountains on both sides. Where the loess has been eroded, the Permian limestone layers are exposed, as well as conglomerate and shale. The wheat fields I saw were on both banks of the Qi River. Horses and mules running in the fields were not considered strange, nor was it considered strange for them to eat the wheat, but people from Jiangnan would inevitably find it strange. At this time, the farmers do not hope for rain or warmth, otherwise the wheat will grow too tall, and it will be difficult to expect a good harvest next year, because the soil is loose, and they are afraid that it will not be strong and will not produce grain. They even need to press it down with a roller, so these wheat plants are like piles of wild vegetables, flat and spread on the ground. At this time, they do not mind the trampling and grazing of horses, as long as it grows strong. The local saying here is: "Pigs in the first month, cats in the second month, women running all over the ground in the third month." In the first month, the crops have not sprouted, and pigs are allowed to run around. In the second month, cats are in heat and do not stay home. In the third month, farm women gather edible weeds everywhere. This is true throughout the wheat belt of the north.

The road was full of farmers driving mules, some transporting coal from the Jinsuo Pass area to Yao County, some carrying corn to the city to sell. There were absolutely no mule carts, the only convenient tool for travel, indicating that there were no travelers. The ancient road had a sense of the west wind, and the horse I was riding, borrowed from the army, was not thin. Traveling with these farmers, I had a strong feeling of "the soldiers are thin, and the warhorses are fat." They drove the mule herds, shouting loudly or scolding them intimately, the whips cracking, making the ancient road less lonely. Their shouts were mostly short commands, mostly a single sound, occasionally with a retroflex sound. They say that there are more than a hundred commands for driving mules, which cannot be recorded with writing or phonetic symbols. They can use commands to direct them to go left, right, fast, or slow, but when I learned their commands, I couldn't get the mules to move. They said, "The mules recognize the voice." The mules are all very fat. They said, "Good feed is better than bait." This saying means that as long as the grass is mixed evenly, the livestock will eat their fill, without the need for special bait.

They rely on their pitiful agriculture, the knowledge accumulated over generations of worshipping deities, and live their lives. Often there are many touching farm sayings buried in the Chinese countryside, and this place is no exception. They sing praises to wild grasses, saying: "Wormwood in the first month, motherwort in the second month, cut it in the third month and burn it as firewood." They describe the tender grass in the first month as fragrant as wormwood, and praise wormwood (a medicinal plant that can be used to make wine). The grass turns green in the second month, and the grass is lush after the third month, ready to be used as fuel, which is the season when the ground is frozen and the grass is yellow. As they spoke, I recorded a large number of proverbs. I felt that due to the difference in latitude, water conservancy, and geological climate, their hopes for rain and early harvests, or their predictions of the weather, were significantly different from those in Jiangnan.

They have their own names for animals and plants. Male pigs and dogs are called "tooth pigs" and "tooth dogs", while females are called "grass pigs" and "grass dogs". For cats, they are called "Lang cats" and "Nu cats". But male horses are called "er horses", and female horses are called "mu horses". Male mules are called "jiao mules", and females are called "cao mules". Middle-aged pigs have a special name, they call them "ka lang zi". Crickets are called "vinegar spiders", and ants are called "fart floating horses". These are all local dialects. They call polygala "wild lentils" and bupleurum "chicken tongue". They hate cuckoos, calling them "murderous robbers", because their calls are unpleasant and evoke no goodwill. They do not know the elegant name that scholars and poets give this bird.

Flocks of wild pigeons and pheasants gather in the wheat fields. They fly slowly, and there are many of them. If one had a hunting rifle, one could definitely harvest a good haul.

### Tongguan Coal Mine

Last year on Double Tenth Day, Tongguan County was renamed Tongchuan County. When people from Shaanxi mention Tongguan, they specifically say "North Tongguan" because the pronunciation is the same as that of Tongguan. The telegraph office's Latin alphabet spelling encountered difficulties, often sending telegrams from the two counties to the wrong place. But Tongguan Coal Mine is still Tongguan Coal Mine.

Xi'an is experiencing a severe coal shortage, but in Yao County and Tongchuan, tens of thousands of tons of coal are piled up. The mixed coal costs four to five thousand yuan per ton, while the price in Xi'an is three times higher. Some employees on the Chengtong branch line have abandoned their work of waving red and green flags to sell coal, making three times the profit. I asked why the Longhai Railway couldn't transport the coal to Xi'an to alleviate the coal shortage this winter. The answer was that there were not enough cars. Currently, Tongguan Mine can produce an average of 650 tons per day, and the Longhai Railway needs 600 tons. That little bit extra cannot be shipped out. However, of the investment in Tongguan Coal Mine, two-thirds came from the Longhai Railway and one-third from the provincial government. According to the share capital calculation, the provincial government said that it should be given 200 tons. The coal merchants are very resourceful and can find a way to transport a little bit out, because the interest on the Longhai Railway is a disguised sale of train cars. Along the way, inspectors, switchmen, and even clerks extort money. Everyone at the station has great power. One switchman said that the train wouldn't leave if he didn't switch the tracks. Transportation is fraught with difficulties. The Longhai Railway is to blame for the absurdly high price of coal in Xi'an. Therefore, on the Xian-Yu highway, there are long-distance mule trains and handcarts transporting coal. Tongguan County has more than twenty private small mines. These peddlers only want large pieces, because they are easy to load and transport. Small pieces or crushed coal are piled up in the mines, and no one cares about them. The Longhai Railway has a Longhai Enterprise Company. The Japanese Manchurian Railway, which invaded the Northeast, used railways as the center to develop enterprises and do big business. The people of Shaanxi ask what kind of enterprise the Longhai Railway is. Just run the railway well. I heard that it has recently registered with the authorities.

When I arrived at the Wulipu Tongguan Government Coal Mine, the new and old mine managers were just completing the handover. The mine manager is decided by the council formed by the provincial government and the railway bureau. The new mine manager, Ma Qingyuan, is an old member of the Tongmenghui. From the time of the Shaanxi Jingguo Army to the extension of the central government's power into Shaanxi, his troops entered Xi'an and he served as the first garrison commander, and he always took a firm stance against Yang Hucheng. Before the victory, he was a counselor to the Military Affairs Commission? He retired this year and received a pension. "Without this pension, I wouldn't even be able to travel." This 54-year-old veteran said to me with a firm attitude: "Tongguan Coal Mine has made contributions during the War of Resistance, and it is the only large coal mine in the Northwest. We must take a long-term view and operate this mine from the standpoint of developing the Northwest." When it comes to coal quality, it cannot compare to Guanyintang in Henan, let alone Jiaozuo. It contains 5% sulfur and is semi-anthracite coal. He said, "If transportation becomes smooth in the future, and other mines become more flexible in supplying coal, this mine will have problems." However, he believes that standing from the point of developing the Northwest, one should not think opening one more mine is excessive. "And one can find ways to reduce costs and make the selling price cheaper."

There are more than 6,000 workers in this mine, with an average wage of only around 1,600 yuan per month. The monthly salary of engineers is only around 200,000 yuan. The treatment is low and should be increased immediately. The Longhai Railway takes 600 tons of coal and only pays the cost plus 20% profit, but the Longhai Railway is in arrears and does not allow the mine to sell coal itself. The losses of the Longhai Railway are compensated by the coal mine. So he sighed to me: "I've only been here for eight days, and I don't know the internal situation very well. I still feel that this problem is very serious. There are many personnel problems. The first thing now is to adjust the treatment. The disadvantage of government-run enterprises is that there are too many administrative staff, and sometimes their treatment is higher than that of engineering personnel. This is also an unreasonable phenomenon here. I have already told everyone that I am definitely not here to make money at the mine. If I take improper wealth, please report me to the staff."

Currently, there are four plants, twelve shafts, and several are abandoned shafts. Three shafts are contracted to merchants, and about seven are in operation. The power comes from several abandoned train engines. The materials and machines were put together during the war. If equipment is added, it is practically impossible to do so, and even if it is done, it will naturally increase production. If the transportation problem is not resolved, there is still no way to talk about development. The workers all live in cave dwellings. The cave dwellings are warm, and there are mosquitoes even in December. The mine's hospital has records that it diagnosed 7,800 cases of malaria-like infections last year. That is to say, on average, everyone has seen a doctor once. The second most common ailment is eye disease, followed by respiratory diseases. There have been thousands of diagnoses for each.

The mine area covers more than 2,600 hectares and is estimated to have reserves of 50 million tons. The entire Tongguan coal deposit belongs to the Carboniferous-Permian coal-bearing system, which runs across the large east-west anticline limestone, dividing it into northern and southern districts. After prospecting, it was found that the coal shafts, which were mined using primitive methods, had penetrated the coal-bearing system and reached the limestone. Observing the columnar section, the northern coal seam slopes northwest, high in the east and low in the west, low in the south and high in the north, with an average thickness of up to four meters and a total area of 44.7 million square meters. Taking a specific gravity of 1.3, multiplying these three numbers yields a total reserve of 284.44 million metric tons. If only half of it is minable, then a daily output of 4,000 metric tons can be mined for a century. However, at present, including more than twenty private small mines, the daily output is only 1,200 metric tons.

I ran to No. 1 shaft, which is more than 60 meters deep. There is no methane, so oil lamps can be used. This shaft is mined using the room and pillar method. The mine roadway has expanded to an area of 700 to 800 mu. Drainage is carried out in the natural pores of the limestone. The Tongguan rock layers are mostly soft shale and less hard shale, so only the room and pillar method can be used. The miners wear thick cloth on their heads and tie their lamps to their foreheads. The flames flicker as they push carts or drag coal baskets, wriggling like earthworms. This is also life. They work eight or twelve hour shifts. The primitive mines are operated by civilian labor. The workers change shifts every ten days or half a month. During the shift change, they eat and sleep at the bottom of the mine, never seeing the light of day. They are truly underground workers.

### The Strategic Location of the Majestic Pass: One Sweepingly Commands a View of Chang'an to the South

The Guanzhong Plain, stretching from Tongguan to Ji, is what is called the Jing and Wei Plain. Its shape is similar to that between Shanghai and Nanjing, but its width is only tens of miles, and its area is only 40,000 square miles. (In my previous article, "Guanzhong Covered in Frost and Snow, Fields and Gardens," I mentioned the irrigation projects of the Shaanxi Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau. In addition, there are several canals assisted by the Shaanxi Provincial Agricultural Improvement Institute for local construction: the Wugong Weihui Canal, irrigating 2,000 mu of land; the Yunyang Leading-Flood Canal, irrigating 20,000 mu of land. This canal is built by damming and guiding mountain floods to irrigate the fields, and the mountain floods that rush down contain a unique amount of phosphorus fertilizer; the Weinan Huihui Canal, irrigating 20,000 mu of land, was built with funds allocated by the British China Aid Association and will be completed this winter; the Fuping Huihui Canal, irrigating 20,000 mu of land, can be opened for water next spring. The irrigation projects in Shaanxi are mostly these.) From Sanyuan to Yaoxian, after dozens of miles, you reach the edge of the plain. Climbing a mountain, you see a vast plain, which is actually the Loess Plateau. Reaching Tongguan, you enter the mountainous area, and it becomes even higher at Yijun, becoming the backbone separating northern Shaanxi from Guanzhong. In Yijun, you need to wear lined clothes even in summer. Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty built the Yuhua Palace there as a summer retreat. Going north from Yijun to Huangling and Luochuan, the terrain becomes lower again. The Jinshuo Pass, located between Yijun and Tongguan, stands majestically in the mountains, like a natural moat, becoming an important and strategic location since ancient times, which is not accidental.

The Guanzhong Plain is high in the west and low in the east, leaning against the Liupan Mountains in the northwest and separated by the Meridian Ridge in the north. The northern Shaanxi region, north of Tongguan and Yijun, is actually a basin, leaning against the Meridian Ridge, high in the west and low in the east, a stretch of loess and red soil, forming a good wheat-growing belt. Northern Shaanxi is isolated, and the people are poor, but the land is not barren, which is quite different from general perceptions. Since the Qin and Han dynasties, it has been abandoned by the Western Qiang. In successive dynasties, whenever there were affairs in the west, it was often regarded as a crucial area for military operations. Zuo Zongtang pacified the Hui people, and his subordinate Liu Songshan led troops north from Xi'an to Suide. After the Republic of China, there was also the so-called "Bandit Suppression" campaign. Li Zicheng rose from northern Shaanxi, not to mention. As a result, water conservancy was not maintained, education was not promoted, the imperial court regarded it as a border area, and officials regarded it as a daunting path. Guanzhong and northern Shaanxi, though geographically close, were worlds apart. Although there were fertile fields, they were not developed. Most of the northwest is like this, not just a corner of northern Shaanxi. Observing the scenery after water conservancy improvements in the Jinghui Canal area, and then riding a horse in front of the Jinshuo Pass, the bare hills are severely eroded, the gullies are crisscrossed, and the mounds could have been good farmland, but now they are all abandoned land. The court and the public engage in lofty political discussions, and wars continue endlessly. Opium is rampant on the blockhouse line, and the further north you go, the cheaper the price becomes. The withering of the people's livelihood can be imagined.

The terrain in the area the reporter passed through is extremely complex, and detailed surveying is most difficult. The Meridian Ridge meanders to Yijun and Tongguan. At first glance, they are all loess layers, but the southeastern area of Tongguan has a large portion of exposed red soil, which is likely the famous Sanmen Series red soil. The loess layer was originally covering the red soil and can be as thick as tens of meters, showing the severity of the erosion. The He Plateau looks like a mountain range from afar, but it is actually due to erosion and fragmentation. Often, two plains are separated by a deep valley, making it impossible to pass between them. You have to go a long way around, and the bottom of the valley becomes a road or wheat field again. A few hours of heavy rain can create a gully. Although the loess is thousands of feet high, seemingly indestructible, the ease of erosion is very estimable.

The county seat of Tongguan has only two thousand several hundred residents. Traveling thirty miles north from the city, you reach the Jinshuo Pass. Going west from the pass, it is only ten to twenty miles to Guanqian. The reporter originally planned to go north to Huangling, but at this time, the roads were mostly blocked, and there were frequent incidents. After traveling through seven counties in ten days, I could get a glimpse of the local customs, so I turned back to Xi'an. The Jinshuo Pass was built in the Song Dynasty. During the Qing Dynasty, for defense, there was only one garrison officer. Later, it was changed to one patrol officer, with twenty soldiers. Each soldier received only eight months of silver per year, one tael per month, and five shi of rice per year, supplied by the county. People in the county can still talk about it now, showing the difference in the burden between the past and the present. Now, the reporter rides a horse in front of the pass and sees only a section of the pass wall winding down the mountain. The two mountains converge, and the rocky cliffs become a steep and dangerous road. The old pass has been widened into a highway going north. The function of the "majestic pass" of the past has completely disappeared. Climbing the pass and looking around, the vastness of the eight directions is visible. Looking south from a high vantage point, everything is in full view. The border pass relics still have former barracks and cultivated land, with half a clump of decaying willows, resembling an old, gray-bearded soldier hoeing the foothills and watching the setting sun over the southern mountains.

### A Brief Discussion on the Uses of Plasma

— Yi Jianlong

Significant progress was made in therapeutic drugs during World War II. This significant progress has provided a deeper layer of protection for human health and life. In terms of the order of progress, it can be said that the first is the synthesis and evolution of mineral preparations; the second is the preservation and unlimited use of plasma; and the third is the invention and mass production of penicillin. People in China clearly have a considerable understanding of the therapeutic value of the first and third points, but their understanding of the uses and methods of the second point seems to be superficial, and they may even abandon it due to improper use. In the early stages of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the author studied blood transfusion therapy with experts in the United States and Canada. After returning to China, he presided over the blood bank in Kunming for many years. Therefore, I will give a brief introduction based on my research and experience.

(1) Composition – To know the uses of plasma, one must first understand its effective components. Plasma is made from uncoagulated blood and is a mixture of colloidal and crystalline substances. Its effective components can be described as follows:

(A) Essential Nutrients – All nutrients that have been digested by the stomach and intestines must be absorbed and transported by plasma before they can reach the tissues of various parts of the human body. Furthermore, the remaining or stored nutrients in the tissues must also be absorbed and transported by plasma before they can enter the nutrient-deficient tissues. From this perspective, plasma is nothing less than a general stepping stone for nutrients. All the nutrients required by the human body, such as proteins, amino acids, fats, fatty acids, glucose, vitamins, and inorganic salts, should be readily available.

(B) Substances that Maintain Osmotic Pressure – The circulating blood volume of a healthy human body is always constant, accounting for 9% of body weight. The reason why it can be kept constant is mostly due to the osmotic pressure in the plasma. This osmotic pressure can prevent the exudation of fluids from the blood vessels, and it can also return the fluids that have already exuded back into the blood vessels. There are two substances in the blood that maintain osmotic pressure, namely proteins and salts.

(C) Hormones – Hormones are the mechanism for constantly adjusting changes in various parts of the human body. For example, thyroid and growth hormones control development, insulin controls carbohydrate metabolism, and ovarian hormones control fertility. These hormones originate in the endocrine glands and are then sent to various organs through the blood. Therefore, there are also hormones in the plasma.

(D) Various Enzymes – The human body's metabolism and antitoxic effects are mostly mediated by enzymes. There are many enzymes contained in plasma, the most notable of which is clotting enzyme.

(E) Various Antibodies – When the human body is attacked by bacteria, it produces antibodies that circulate in the plasma to fight against the bacteria. The types and amounts of antibodies in the blood vary from person to person. In the mixed plasma of the majority, the types and amounts of antibodies are generally greater.

(F) Other Life Elements of Unknown Origin.

(2) Uses and Methods – Knowing the effective components of plasma, its uses can be inferred. The uses and methods of plasma can be described as follows:

(A) Traumatic and Surgical Shock

The etiology of shock is still uncertain, but its significant pathological change, which is the escape of plasma out of the blood vessels, has been generally recognized. Due to the action of some malignant factors, the blood vessels dilate and their permeability increases, causing plasma to escape into the surrounding tissues. As a result, the circulating blood volume is greatly reduced, and the supply of oxygen and other nutrients to the tissues is insufficient. If not treated immediately, the patient will generally die within 9 to 12 hours. The effective method to treat shock is to quickly infuse plasma. American shock expert Dr. Scudder said: "If you do not transfuse blood when you should, death can be expected immediately; if you transfuse insufficient blood, it is all in vain." Blood specific gravity, hemocrit, and blood pressure are the standards for determining the timing and quantity of blood transfusion. If the blood specific gravity and hemocrit are higher than normal and the blood pressure drops to 70% below normal, it is clear evidence of hemoconcentration and a significant decrease in cardiac output. A large amount of plasma should be infused immediately until the three indicators return to normal. The expressions of shock patients in China are often not as obvious as those of Caucasians. Even when they are on the verge of death, their condition is calm as before. Therefore, laboratory tests and diagnosis are very important. If the patient can still eat and has no symptoms of dehydration, concentrated plasma or concentrated serum albumin can be instilled intravenously to increase the osmotic pressure within the blood vessels, so that the plasma that has permeated into the surrounding tissues returns to the blood vessels. To prevent the occurrence of surgical shock, it is best to infuse 300 to 500 cc of plasma before and after major surgery. This procedure has become an indispensable routine in the operating rooms of major hospitals in the United States.

(B) Hemorrhagic Shock

Internal and external injuries and bleeding can certainly cause shock, but massive hemoptysis, gastrointestinal bleeding, ectopic pregnancy bleeding, and metrorrhagia can also cause severe shock. The difference between this type of shock and the above shock is that the blood specific gravity, hemocrit, and blood pressure all decrease simultaneously. Under these circumstances, plasma should be rapidly instilled through multiple veins simultaneously to allow the patient to overcome the dangerous period, and then followed by the instillation of whole blood or red blood cells. If the circulating blood volume is lost by more than one-third, it can be life-threatening, and if the loss of red blood cells does not exceed 60%, it can still maintain its minimum gas exchange function.

(C) Burns or Scalds

The most severe burns or scalds can cause shock, so plasma should be instilled in addition to local treatment to stop the shock. Even after the shock has passed, plasma will continue to exude from the affected area. According to Dr. Scudder's estimate, if a third-degree burn covers one-third of the total body area, the plasma loss from the affected area in 24 hours will be more than 400 cc. To maintain the patient's normal blood volume, the instillation of plasma is essential. If the patient can still ingest fluids on their own, concentrated plasma should be used.

(D) Secondary Anemia

The treatment for this type of anemia is to eliminate its source and promote the production of red blood cells. To promote the production of red blood cells, it is necessary to supply as much raw materials for red blood cell production as possible, including proteins and iron. Plasma contains sufficient protein and other nourishing substances, which can supply part of the raw materials for red blood cell production, so it can be an adjunct to iron therapy.

(E) Malnutrition

In severe malnutrition, the protein in the blood is lower than normal. As a result, the water in the blood continues to seep into the surrounding tissues, forming edema throughout the body. For this type of disease, only repeated injections of concentrated plasma based on blood protein tests can quickly restore the patient.

(F) Protein Deficiency Syndrome

Protein deficiency syndrome is caused by fatty changes in the renal tubules. The blood protein of these patients is constantly excreted from the kidneys. Therefore, the protein in the blood is significantly reduced, which can also form edema throughout the body. These patients should also be treated with plasma. If the daily excretion of protein is more than 25 cc and the patient cannot ingest more protein, then 400 cc of plasma should be infused daily, because the protein in plasma is usually around 7%.

(G) Feverish Diseases

In patients with diseases such as typhoid fever, typhus, and tuberculosis, gastrointestinal digestion and absorption are abnormal, and the consumption of physical strength is large. As a result, there is a negative nitrogen balance. This pathological change not only reduces the patient's resistance but can also cause adverse complications. If plasma is injected continuously in addition to drinking more fluids, the patient's nutrition and resistance can be improved.

(H) Gastrointestinal Diseases

Whether or not these patients have undergone surgical treatment, if they cannot ingest more nutrients, they will inevitably deteriorate. The remedy is to continuously inject plasma to improve nutrition and promote the healing of the affected area. A sedentary adult needs at least 50 cc of protein per day, which is 700 cc of plasma. Healthy plasma contains 7 cc of protein per 100 cc.

(I) Acute Infectious Diseases

Mixed human plasma has various antibodies, so it can prevent measles, whooping cough, chickenpox, scarlet fever, erysipelas, and adenitis. Experiments by American pediatrician Dr. Bavenberg have shown that among 4,733 children who had been given measles vaccinations (each person injected with 20 to 40 cc of plasma intramuscularly), only six cases of primary measles were found, while among 11,280 children who had not been given measles vaccinations, 94 people contracted primary measles.

(J) Premature Infants

With the advancement of modern medicine, the lives of infants born less than six months after conception can also be maintained. In addition to regulating the temperature of the incubator, providing oxygen, and providing special nutrition, small amounts of plasma can be injected continuously.

(K) Increased Intracranial Pressure and Lumps in the Breasts

For these patients, if concentrated plasma or concentrated serum albumin can be injected continuously while reducing fluid intake, the results obtained are far better than treatment with magnesium sulfate laxatives.

Although plasma has many uses, there are also contraindications. If there is liver and kidney dysfunction, excessive blood pressure, congestive heart failure, or acute pulmonary edema, plasma infusion should be performed with caution, and large amounts are especially not advisable.

(3) Methods for Identifying the Quality of Plasma – After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the U.S. military's surplus dry plasma also flowed into our country's market along with other surplus materials. It is difficult to tell which is superior and which is inferior, and modern pharmacopoeias do not have any identification methods. However, the quality of various products is uneven, which is unavoidable. To facilitate identification, I will briefly describe the identification method of dry plasma for the reference of users:

(A) Color – Expired dry plasma is a light, amorphous powder that is always straw yellow. It should not be used if it is coagulated, does not disperse, or has a pale green color.

(B) Unexpired dry plasma should dissolve completely within one minute after adding distilled water.

(C) Solution Turbidity – Turbidity is a common physical property of liquid plasma, but under an electric colorimeter, its turbidity should not exceed 700 degrees.

(D) Residual Moisture – The residual moisture in dry plasma should not exceed 1.0%.

(E) Non-pyrogenic – The so-called pyrogenic substances are bacterial corpses or bacterial secretions. If the equipment used to prepare plasma is not washed with special drugs, or the soda used to dissolve dry plasma is not disinfected with a special filter, fever cannot be avoided.

### Protein Hydrolysates: Their Physiological Effects and Therapeutic Efficacy

— Lecture by Xu Zhaodui, Notes by Tao Shouqi

In-depth research on protein nutrition began more than forty years ago. At that time, famous scholars made contributions to the protein content of food, the transformation numbers of protein and nitrogen, the nitrogen balance of the body, and the biological value of protein. Later research also elucidated the analysis of amino acids, the identification of major amino acids, the relationship between protein and edema, and so on. However, previous work was largely scattered and unsystematic. Among them, Chittenden's research asserted that the human body's need for and tolerance of protein was quite low, which had a dangerous impact, because the general impression was that the protein required by the human body was extremely easy to meet. At that time, research on vitamins was developing rapidly and soon showed its importance. Therefore, general clinicians today only know to pay attention to vitamins and often neglect the importance of protein. Until recently, due to the application of novel and rapid protein detection methods, as well as the mass production and therapeutic development of protein hydrolysates, the topic of protein nutrition has once again aroused the interest and attention of the medical community.

The Main Functions of Protein: The main functions of protein for the human body are briefly described as follows:

(1) Maintaining Blood Volume – The Urgent Function of Protein: The protein in plasma is a colloidal substance, so it can produce an effective osmotic pressure to resist capillary blood pressure, so that the liquid in the blood vessels does not overflow excessively, and blood volume is maintained. At any wound site, in addition to bleeding, there is often exudation of plasma protein, which reduces the osmotic pressure of the blood and thus aggravates the reduction in blood volume.

(2) Maintaining Tissue Integrity: The results of research on bedsores have shown the importance of protein for tissue integrity. Patients with bedsores have excessively low blood protein and a negative nitrogen balance. If protein intake can be increased, so that the nitrogen balance turns positive, the bedsores will also heal accordingly, because tissues lacking protein nutrition have reduced vitality and are prone to collapse.

(3) Promoting Wound Healing: Protein deficiency affects the growth of fibrous tissue, making it difficult for any wound to contract. When the protein in the blood is excessively low after surgery, the wound often tends to break open. If the amount of protein intake can be increased, the wound will heal rapidly.

(4) Promoting the Production of Immunoglobulins, Endocrine Substances, and Enzymes: The existence of this function is only a hypothesis and needs to be clearly proven before it can be established.

(5) Function During the Recovery Period: Protein metabolism during the recovery period from illness often undergoes significant changes due to the action of the following factors: A. Patients who experience loss of appetite, nausea, or vomiting during illness may reduce their protein intake. B. The diet in hospitals often contains excessively low amounts of protein due to economic or other difficulties. C. Patients with gastrointestinal disorders have poor protein absorption. D. The Impact of Exudation – Any loss of fluid from the body is inevitably accompanied by a loss of protein, especially the fluid exuded from the surface of burns or large abscesses, which contains particularly high levels of protein. Therefore, patients with extensive burns or empyema often lose no less than 50 to 60 grams of protein per day. E. The amount of protein excreted in the urine during illness or injury is often several times higher than normal. From the above five points, it can be seen that the human body is often deprived of large amounts of protein during illness or injury. Therefore, it is necessary to replenish protein during the recovery period.

High-Level Nutritional Therapy: Natural diets usually contain about 10 grams of nitrogen per day, while high-protein diets contain 20 grams. Therefore, if the need for protein increases to a considerable extent under morbid conditions, it is by no means something that natural diets can cope with, and amino acids or protein hydrolysates must be given. When the need for protein intake exceeds the amount that natural foods can provide, it is called hyperalimentation.

Application of Protein Hydrolysates: Pure amino acid mixtures (translator's note: amino acids are the final products produced when proteins are digested or broken down, and are thus absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract; their relationship to proteins is like that of glucose to carbohydrates) are difficult to manufacture and expensive, so protein hydrolysates are more suitable. Protein hydrolysates can be manufactured from milk, meat, fish, soybeans, brewer's yeast, or other protein-containing foods. The administration of protein hydrolysates has the following advantages: (1) No digestion is required. (2) Small volume. (3) Can be taken as medicine, unaffected by appetite. (4) There is no conflict with hospital authorities who want to save money on patient diets. Its main disadvantages are: (1) The taste is not good. (2) Large doses can cause diarrhea.

Therapeutic Uses of Protein Hydrolysates

(1) Peptic Ulcers: High-level nutritional therapy for peptic ulcers has already been discussed by Dr. Xue Bangqi in a previous issue of this journal, so it does not need to be repeated in this article.

(2) Malnutrition: Patients with malnutrition can be treated with high-level nutritional therapy to make edema subside within four or five days, and to restore blood protein and red blood cell levels.

(3) Pulmonary Tuberculosis: High-level nutritional therapy can be used in conjunction with other methods of treating pulmonary tuberculosis to accelerate the progress of the condition.

(4) Postoperative Care: Performing surgery, especially surgery on the gastrointestinal tract, followed by high-level nutritional therapy can promote the patient's nutrition and shorten their recovery period.

### The Latest on Vitamins

— Shao

Although folic acid was discovered many years ago, its chemical structure was only recently elucidated, and its artificial synthesis has only now been successfully announced.

Chemically speaking, folic acid is composed of three different chemical groups: pterin, p-aminobenzoic acid, and glutamic acid. Pterin is a yellow pigment found in butterfly wings; folic acid is also a yellow crystal.

Folic acid was originally a component of the vitamin B complex, initially called the "Lactobacillus casei factor" because it is essential for the reproduction of Lactobacillus casei. Recent reports indicate that folic acid is also a necessary element for human hematopoietic function and has special effects on various megaloblastic anemias, no different from liver preparations. Liver preparations are difficult to purify, and their detection requires clinical cases of pernicious anemia, resulting in high prices and inconvenient use. Folic acid is an artificial synthetic product, requiring no bioassay. Future mass production will inevitably lower the price, and the day when it completely replaces liver preparations is not far off.

As early as 1935, Day et al. reported that natural folic acid (initially called vitamin M) was effective in preventing a type of nutritional anemia in white rats. However, the therapeutic effect of this artificial synthetic product on human megaloblastic anemia was not discovered until 1945 by the American vitamin expert Spies et al. They tested several cases of nutritional megaloblastic anemia common in the southern United States and obtained the same therapeutic effect as liver preparations, with a rapid increase in the number of reticulocytes in the blood, followed by a steady rise in the number of red blood cells and the amount of hemoglobin. This year, it was also tested on Sprue, megaloblastic anemia during pregnancy, and true pernicious anemia, all with the same success. These results have been fully confirmed by Darby, Moore, et al., and Zuclzer & Cgden et al. in the same country. Recently, Wilkinson et al. in the United Kingdom used folic acid in five cases of pernicious anemia and obtained similarly satisfactory results.

However, folic acid is not the active ingredient (antianemia factor) in liver preparations, as folic acid is a bright orange-yellow crystal, while the most refined liver extract is colorless. Willmson believes that folic acid may stimulate the production of hematopoietic factors in the body. However, according to the experimental report published by Jacobson & William of the United Kingdom in the October issue of the Journal of Pathology and Bacteriology last year, the antianemia factor in the liver and folic acid may belong to the same class of compounds, and their main chemical group is pterin. According to the research of these two scholars, synthetic xanthopterin and leucopterin, as well as liver extract, can all produce the same reticulocyte reaction in splenectomized rabbits, while other substances such as iron and various vitamins (unfortunately, folic acid was not tested) do not have this effect. Therefore, they believe that the liver antianemia factor may be a pterin derivative.

### World Health Organization (Part 2)

— Qiao Shumin

1.  A New Definition of Health: The preamble to the constitution of the organization reveals the most progressive and broadest definition of health, considering health to be a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, not merely the absence of disease. It also recognizes the highest attainable standard of health as a fundamental right of every human being, without distinction as to race, religion, political belief, economic, or social condition. It further considers governments to have an inescapable responsibility for the protection of the health of their peoples. Readers, consider: What is the view of the meaning of health held by our people? How many people enjoy this basic right? Has the government fulfilled its responsibility to protect the health of the people?

2.  Regarding the Function of Hygiene: They all believe that scientific hygiene is of great help to human peaceful coexistence in this turbulent world. They firmly believe that sanitary facilities will improve the people's standard of living and promote social and economic prosperity, thereby helping to accomplish our common goal - world peace. They all believe that only healthy and well-nourished people can truly understand the true meaning of basic freedom. They also believe that public health is an active and comprehensive crystallization of many scientific principles. In many advanced countries, due to sanitary facilities, the average life expectancy of people has doubled compared to the last century. However, the development situation in various countries is very unbalanced. In some countries, barely half of the children born survive to the age of five, and the average life expectancy of their people is only half that of people in more prosperous countries. They also believe that to achieve the great purpose of the World Health Organization, the greatest effort and sustained effort of our health and acoustic personnel are needed; however, relying solely on our efforts will not be enough; we must mobilize all mankind and enable them to understand the principles of hygiene and strive together. Readers, consider: How many of our people understand the true meaning of basic freedom? What is the average life expectancy of our people? Only heaven knows, perhaps only half of that of the United States and the United Kingdom. To what extent are our health and medical personnel working hard? To what extent have the people been mobilized?

3.  Regarding the Impact of Unhygienic Conditions: They all believe that in the field of hygiene, countries are interdependent and interconnected. An epidemic in any region can endanger other countries. A low standard of health for the people not only hinders the economic prosperity of their own country but also affects the overall prosperity of the world. Readers, consider: What is the impact of the annual prevalence of smallpox, cholera, typhoid fever, dysentery, relapsing fever, [a disease name], black fever, plague, hookworm disease, schistosomiasis, tuberculosis, etc., on our country and the world?

4.  Regarding the Future Mission of the World Health Organization: In the future, all previously established international health organizations will be merged into this new World Health Organization. It will use all the latest scientific knowledge and equipment to defeat the god of disease and plague, so disease prevention is still the primary goal. But this is only the first step. It must be known how many people in the world are struggling below the hunger line! Therefore, using our nutritional knowledge to cooperate with efforts in agricultural and food production to achieve freedom from hunger is also one of the goals. The second step is to positively promote physical and mental health in a balanced way, in order to achieve a higher level of physical development, a longer life span, more effective production capacity, and a more meaningful life.

However, if human beings cannot live in peace and there is another major war, everything will be destroyed, and hygiene will be in vain. We should know that science can be used for good or evil. The key lies not in the scientists themselves, but in the awareness and conscience of the broad masses of people to determine the good or bad fortune and life and death of human destiny. From the standpoint of striving for world peace, the World Health Organization does not seem to be a rallying point for uniting people all over the world, a friendship response for people of different cultures and different beliefs, and may become a hot stone for world peace organizations. I can't help but gather incense to wish it well!

### Diagnosis of Peptic Ulcers with X-rays

— Chen Youxin

There are two significant differences between X-ray examinations of the stomach and X-ray examinations of the lungs. The first point is the difference in tissues. The lungs can naturally show their contours under X-rays without relying on another medium; this natural manifestation is not possible for the stomach, so a special medicine is usually needed to fill its interior before it can be examined. This medicine is either pure barium sulfate or barium sulfate synthesized with other unimportant ingredients. Taking this medicine alone has some limewater-like appearance and some soil-like taste. This medicine is very good. It does not cause any chemical reactions in the gastrointestinal tract, does not hinder the work of the gastrointestinal tract, does not cause any side effects, and is not poisonous, but it can help with the examination. The second difference is that the work of the stomach is intermittent, while the work of the lungs is continuous. Thus, the examination of the stomach needs a starting point and an ending point. The examination starts when the stomach is empty, and the ending point is when there is no residue of barium in the stomach. The examination between these two points can be adjusted according to the actual situation. From this point of view, the examination of the stomach is more complicated compared to the examination of the lungs.

The method of examining the stomach emphasizes both fluoroscopy and radiography. In terms of the diagnostic value itself, fluoroscopy is more important than radiography. During fluoroscopy, the position of the stomach can be changed freely, any part can be palpated, any suspicious place can be observed in detail, the location of tenderness can be determined, the softness or stiffness of the gastric wall, adhesion or prominence, or the hyperfunction or decline of gastric function, the freedom or discontinuity of peristalsis, and the muscle contraction or relaxation of the pyloric or any part can all be accurately conceptualized. Of course, the imprint of the pathogen itself can also be revealed on the fluoroscopy screen at the same time. However, radiography also has special functions. It is not only a record of the shadow for future reference or a blueprint for consultation, but it can also provide information that is omitted during fluoroscopy or is not clearly displayed.

If the above methods cannot be summarized into an accurate diagnosis, then there are several special examination methods that can be used. Now, let's skip over them briefly. There is also a situation where the stomach's symptoms occur as a result of diseases affecting other parts or systems. To give an example, many of the so-called indigestion or stomach pain are caused by diseases of the appendix. There are also so-called true stomach wall erosions that are caused by brain problems. However, even with diseases of the stomach itself, an X-ray examination cannot always lead to a definitive conclusion. However, most failures are mostly due to the mildness of the disease and the short duration of the illness. There are also cases where the main symptoms of the disease are buried during the X-ray examination due to the presence of many secondary signs. Therefore, in many cases, the results of X-ray examinations can only be considered as a clinical reference, like other laboratory methods, and cannot be considered as a diagnosis. However, if the result is very clear, or the examiner is very experienced and confident, it is equivalent to a perfect, independent diagnosis.

Some people also doubt whether the amount of X-rays received during a stomach examination will be harmful to the body. This answer can be negated based on modern knowledge. The amount of X-rays that can cause at least a minimal biological change is difficult to exceed in a careful stomach examination, which means that this consideration is superfluous under normal circumstances.

Now, let's talk about why patients with peptic ulcers need an X-ray examination. The first thing to do is to check if an ulcer exists. If it is confirmed, then its location, size, depth, and number all need to be clarified. Secondly, it is necessary to determine its connection with gastric function, digestive obstacles, gastric emptying obstruction, gastric wall adhesion, or anything else. The second thing is to distinguish whether this ulcer belongs to the ordinary type or the so-called malignant type. The third is about the selection of treatment methods. Even during the treatment of ulcers, X-ray follow-up is also necessary. Determining whether the treatment is effective or not, this follow-up is very helpful. Furthermore, after surgery, the stomach examination can not only provide a strong reference in clinical methods, but also allow for timely preventive measures to prevent ulcer recurrence.

Regarding the X-ray signs of ulcers, the most definitive value is the "niche" sign. The "niche" shadow is a diseased organ with a small protruding area on its contour. This is the shadow caused by the ulcer itself being filled with the medicine consumed. The position of this "niche" is mostly located on the upper edge of the stomach or at the tip of the duodenum directly connected to the stomach, and occasionally on the pylorus or lower end of the esophagus. Although stomach ulcers themselves are much less numerous than duodenal ulcers, the "niche" itself is easier to find in the stomach. However, not every ulcer patient can easily show this important sign, so sometimes it is necessary to rely on other signs to confirm the diagnosis. This will be omitted for now.

Now, let's talk about when a stomach examination cannot be performed. Sometimes, a stomach examination is inappropriate or should be delayed. For example, after stomach bleeding, the palpation during the examination may cause re-bleeding. There are also times when the ulcer is about to perforate, then the procedure during the examination may also cause adverse consequences.

Spring and Autumn

### Yangtze River Journey

— Gan Xiao

The twentieth century should be the era of "man conquering nature," yet in many, many places in our daily lives, we are always "calling to heaven when in extreme distress."

This time, I came from Hankou, traveling from river to river. It was originally a very smooth waterway, but I called to heaven several times. And after arriving home safely, I still felt like an old village woman, feeling "blessed by heaven."

Buying a boat ticket with money is the simplest thing, but I still called to heaven. On the day I arrived in Hankou, several ships were docked on the shore, having already disgorged their cargo and passengers. However, the larger ones belonged to the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and had been designated as "official ships." The smaller ones were ships of private companies, and the official ticket sales time lasted only a few fleeting minutes, forcing people to resort to the black market. A friend who worked at the shipping company listed a bunch of unsafe aspects of black market tickets, which made me, a law-abiding citizen, cautiously retreat. "An honest person does not do shady things." I followed my friend's advice and waited for a "fair market" ticket to become available. As a result, I waited and waited, and the rats and bedbugs in the warehouse launched a brazen attack. I was so anxious that my hair turned white. I firmly advocated giving in to the "black market." Only then did I buy a third-class ticket for the "fixed class" (cabin with berths) at one and a half times the price. First and second-class tickets were naturally lost to the black market.

The ship I was on was not considered young: fifty-three years old! Stepping onto the deck, my feet felt sticky, indicating that it had been seasoned by smoke and grime, not fresh, white, and tender. It was said to be about five hundred tons, and it was loaded with three or four hundred tons of cargo and four or five hundred passengers in Hankou. Most of the passengers were demobilized military and government personnel, embracing boxes, luggage, and sundries. The ship was quite full. There were not many first and second-class passengers. Most of them were third-class "fixed class" and fourth-class "free class." How can these two groups of people be crammed into this fish gut without making people call to heaven!

The "fixed class" berths were divided into upper and lower layers. Mine was on the lower layer. I opened my bedding package and made the bed sideways, and placed a few small pieces of luggage at my feet. In order to reduce crowding, I took off my leather shoes and crawled into bed. Then, bursts of noise came, mainly because the luggage of other passengers was too much, and the steward was trying his best to stop them. What is the use of the stewards? They do not have grass green uniforms and collar badges. Thus, the "fixed class" became a disguised luggage room. The air vents and the south passage were all blocked by luggage. And the most wonderful thing was my "head-over" people: there were a total of eleven of them, but they only bought four upper berths; two berths were prepared for people to sit on; two berths were prepared to put the twenty-five or six pieces of luggage! When they put down six bayonet-mounted rifles, the stewards shut their mouths and stood far away, and the luggage and sundries were moved in one by one. Lying on my back, I could see very clearly: the luggage berth was gradually tilting, and the only horizontal support was gradually bending. I knew that the two female passengers sleeping in the lower berth were in imminent danger. I could not help but stand up and protest. I said:

"This is not a luggage room. If everyone puts their luggage in like this, the air will be completely squeezed out. And putting these luggage on this thin board, the upper berth will collapse and kill people. Who is responsible"?

Hey! Their leader stood up proudly and patted his chest: "I am responsible, I am the brigade commander"! He pointed to the shoulder badge of his major general rank. Oh! Brigade Commander! I thought to myself: "Did the brigade commander fall from the sky? What does he care if people are killed or not"? While thinking this, the horizontal support really broke. If the female passengers' berths below had not also had trunks, they two would have had to test the brigade commander's "responsibility." I don't know why, but I heavily tapped the brigade commander's shoulder, without saying a word, just pressing the flashlight to show him the broken horizontal support. At this time, his arrogance was slightly lower, and he directed his soldiers: "Move the luggage down! People are going to die"! So all of his luggage was stuffed into the passage, and the four berths only slept eleven people. We "lower class" were spared the catastrophe of being crushed to death, and had to thank heaven and earth!

The next morning, I went to the women's restroom: walking along the stern to the kitchen, walking down the steps from the kitchen, passing through the berths of the free class, and turning right. Opening that short door, the situation inside was unbearable to see: it was obviously overflowing with excrement; there was no place to stand. Heavens! The "black slave ships" on the Atlantic in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries must have looked like this?

Climbing up the handrail, a pile of people squatted blocking the way. Looking down, they were all holding rice on the floor with both hands. A bowl of rice was overturned, and the white rice was mixed with the black paste that stained the bottom of the feet, looking like pig lard and sesame rice ball filling. Heavens! This is what they prepared for the third and fourth class passengers!

I wanted to turn to the deck to get some air, but this ship had no deck at all. At a glance, it was all firewood boards like mountains! The friends in the "free class" were all learning Goujian's lying on firewood, taking the firewood boards as beds. In addition to the firewood boards, there were eggs, duck eggs, salted fish, and cured meat, I don't know how many dozens or hundreds of baskets. I asked an old steward and learned that these were the private goods of the ship's purser and stewards. I asked him why so much private goods could be brought? He frowned and smiled bitterly and said: "What else can we do if we don't bring them? There are a total of thirty-five stewards. Not one of us gets paid a lot of money. The ship only provides a bowl of white rice. Everyone has children and wives at home. Most of the passengers are now soldiers, and we can't get tips. What else can we do if we don't bring private goods? Now we are hiding it from the superiors but not from the subordinates. Except for the big boss of the company, the pursers on the ship are all in the same boat. The pursers get paid, and they can also sell berths on the ship; but the private goods they bring are even more than ours." I can't estimate how much weight their private goods have, but when I stretched my head and looked down, the calm river water was almost level with the ship's side. If there was a slight wave, it could hit the porthole. This old small ship was really in danger.

The teacher taught people "not to stand under a dangerous wall." We are now loaded onto a dangerous ship. Looking around, the river is vast. What other way to feel at ease other than calling to heaven in secret?

After passing Datong, the anchor was suddenly dropped in the middle of the night, and everyone asked the steward one after another. The old steward explained: "There is fog! The fog is falling from the sky. The ship's salary is low; the pilot is an inexperienced novice, which is called the blind man not disliking the cripple, and the cripple not disliking the blind man, so we just put up with each other. At this time, it is good to be careful and stop." Heavens, dropping anchor is a good thing! Otherwise, we would have to sacrifice ourselves to their "blindness" and "cripple"!

Approaching Jiangyin, the anchor was dropped again. Impatient passengers all jumped up, and the old steward came to explain again: "Passengers, you are anxious, but our pilot is even more anxious than you. He has a happy event at home tomorrow night. There is no way! The ship is about to reach 'Anchor Sand.' It's dark, and the fog is heavy. How can we go? We still have to be careful about foreign ships. They also say that our ship is an 'old man ship'! Several passengers asked him: 'What is "Anchor Sand"?' 'Anchor Sand'? 'Anchor Sand' is strange! It is an evil spirit! At midnight, it will close in. The ship will run aground, and when it is light, the sand will sink, and the ship will be sucked down. In the past, a French ship ran aground in Dao place, thinking it didn't matter, but it was sucked away by the monster when it was light. Only when the Japanese are here, the monster is also afraid of them and never appears'." Is the monster really afraid of the Japanese? I think there are just more lighthouses!

The anchor was dropped for two hours, and the engine wheezed and started again. The fog deepened layer by layer, and the riverbank was hidden without a trace. The whistle honked a long sound every two minutes. The long sound was like the wail of a dying beast, which made people's hearts mess up! The old steward was complaining like a soliloquy: "Looking for death! To sail in such fog! If we can get through, the pilot can be a bridegroom, but if we can't get through, five hundred people will go to see the King of Hell together"! In the dark night, the half-bright oil lamp swayed, and the reclining passengers looked like corpses. The steward's complaints and the wailing whistle symphonized, making people feel hairy and creepy, as if the King of Hell was beckoning.

Finally, it was dawn, and the sun had the momentum to break through the clouds and dispel the fog. Although the riverbank was still invisible, the whistle was called less and less frequently. After a few more hours, we were finally sent to the Huangpu River bank. When we stepped onto the shore, the renewed rejoicing was like ascending to heaven.

It is so dark on the river. In the twentieth century, traveling on the river still relies on heaven. Who wants to be born at this time and in this place?

### "Fruits" Original Manuscript

— Bao Dixili

Botticelli (Sandro Botticelli I44E-1510) can be regarded as an outstanding talent with a great imagination in the Florentine school. Although he has also painted several Madonna and Child pictures, he is a bold anti-Christian. Representative works include "Ode to Spring", "The Birth of Venus", etc. The composition is special and ingenious, the color is fresh and the lines are beautiful, and the subject matter belongs to fantasy, but the faces depicted are full of love and desire, and have a "modern" feeling. The "Fruits" original manuscript is one of them. (Lion)

### Winter Solstice Grass

— Liu Sui

It is the time when dreams return.

The cold wind outside the window howls.

The clamorous noises cease, and the memories by my pillow turn toward a sorrowful life. A faint sense of melancholy fills my heart.

I seem to hear your faint laughter:

"Your life's journey is gradually turning dim and shrinking!"

Yes, it's been a year, exactly today, the day when people at the Qiantang Riverhead were immersed in rare revelry. The warmth of peace and light lifted our curtains, and we slowly walked through that long and tranquil lake embankment, as if passing through a period of suffering that had already left us behind. Deep in the willow grove, there was the glow of lamplight, and I saw an excited and joyous rise and fall in your chest:

"From now on, you should stagger forward vividly and stubbornly toward the journey you are aiming for!"

"Quietly now!" My lips pressed against your warm hairline: "I am thinking about those splendid and extravagant steps ahead!"

A melodious song came from a corner of the small building, the lake water was still tranquil, and the night mist drifted across our cheeks; we smiled at each other.

Can you say that was a distant dream?

In the third month of spring, this year, I came to this city with you.

I heard people praising this newborn city with blessings.

But I saw a lot:

Those who come from the distant north, besides still retaining some warm memories of the fireside in the snowy sky, haven't they all learned to coax warm vows at the edge of the brightly lit curtains?

And those who have crept into this city from the south, the longing and lingering for the blue sea and sky have faded. In many eye-catching corners, aren't they also composing melodies that make people feel bewildered with the joyful sounds of their hearts?

Who understands lament? Who understands anger? Aren't everyone hastily and confusedly creating things that mock our lives with their own hands?

I helplessly run through every corner of this city again and again. The accusations of the kind are being suffocated to the point of extinction! Everywhere there is harm to society! Oppression of humanity!

There is no story, no poetry, just a page of pitiful blankness!

It was originally a bottomless torrent of murky water!

I gradually forgot singing aloud and shouting wildly, and I slowly learned the worldliness and pretense of life; I accepted the praise and indulgence of the social system, and I also tasted the melancholy and sorrow of the human world. I have become a piece of dross floating in the murky current. Dross will never, and cannot, cause ripples to rise in the murky current!

The vivid and stubborn journey is no longer intimate, and a shameful emptiness remains in my heart.

The disappointment this brings to you is inevitable.

But I am already tired enough.

Yes, it's been a year, exactly today. The people in this city have not withered away the usual revelry, desolate songs are still overflowing, and emerald cypress branches and ivy reflect the flames in the candlelight. All of this deeply evokes my memories.

Let me wash away the idleness and waste of this year with repentance! Even if this city inflicts cruelty and bitterness upon me, there is still next year, there is still a precious period of time... I still have a soul that has not been infected by vulgarity and decline!

I silently meditate by my pillow, facing the candle. You should be able to imagine my mood at this moment.

The clamorous mortal world will return again, won't it? The cold wind outside the window howls.

You should bless it, the future rebirth of this city!

It is the time when dreams return.

The eve of the winter solstice, year thirty-five.

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of Blood 134

— Ye Jingfeng

"Oh!" For the first time, He Jian felt real terror. "Then, where did these numbers come from?"

"That was probably a year ago?"

"What?" He Jian thought he had misheard.

"You know we also have a set of machines. A year ago, we often received this kind of special code, but we didn't pay much attention. Recently, after hearing more about it, Teacher Qingmu spent some effort to solve the numbers... But you don't need to worry, so far, only he alone can decipher it, but it still takes a lot of effort. He doesn't want to publish it, and he doesn't want to do more. He says he still wants to live."

"Ah," He Jian felt a load lift off his shoulders when he heard this. "Pingzi, I have another word. What I'm doing is so difficult, and since the old man said someone else is doing it, this is a good deed to save countless lives. Why doesn't the old man..."

"Why doesn't he try to find that thing?" Pingzi finished He Jian's sentence for him. "It's not that he doesn't want to find it, it's just that he can't find the location where it's hidden."

"Why doesn't he use mysticism?"

"Brother, you say you've also studied mysticism, how can you say such amateurish things?"

"Surely you can perform a technique on the person hiding it?"

"There's no medium."

"Aren't you a ready-made medium?"

"I have no emotional connection with that old fellow, how can I be a medium?" Pingzi was a little angry.

"Alas!" He Jian was disappointed. "Then, goodbye!"

"Goodbye, Brother, definitely goodbye, at least three times; the last goodbye, I heard it's for a very long time!" Pingzi hung up the phone with a chuckle.

He Jian was preoccupied and didn't pay much attention to the meaning of Pingzi's "long time," nor did he want to nag her any further. As for the evening's plan, although it had been disturbed by this phone call, everyone felt that things had reached this stage, and it was like an arrow on the string, which had to be released; moreover, they were somewhat doubtful about Pingzi's words.

At exactly nine o'clock in the evening, He Jian was sitting upright in the military aircraft "Chang Sheng." There were seven or eight people traveling with him, all of whom were active-duty senior officers going to North China, except for He Jian. However, half an hour before the plane took off, the second supplement of Tokyo's evening newspapers, in addition to the frontline news, published a mysterious short message entitled "Challenge to He Jian Wang by a Mysterious Opponent," which read: "To He Jian Yujun: I have long admired your excellent skills as a man. Now you encounter a favorable opportunity: the Prime Minister also favors you with a strange eye; a meteoric rise is just around the corner. However, although my colleagues are humble, we do not dare to act on behalf of others. We dare to make suggestions and presumptuously demand a slight price; a sword, a gentle rain, we ask for one or two hands, that is enough. Around 11 pm, 'Beppu' sincerely awaits. With respect, the Silk Field Society."

That day, the evening newspapers all treated this matter as fresh news. After publishing this mysterious short message, the chief editors of each newspaper also attached a few thoughts: some said, "Why are you fighting among yourselves?" Others said, "The style of the knights of the Edo fifteenth century is seen again today!" Still others said something like "A chivalrous thief challenging Holmes, there will be a good show to watch!" There were also those who said, "Soldiers should serve the country loyally, and should do their best, not seek credit. Why be jealous? If you feel indignant, you should be upright and stand up and have a contest in front of the public, and it is better to be upright than to use sneaky tricks."

On the side of the plane, five or six of the eight passengers bought several copies of the second supplement; although the newspapers were different, they happened to publish this short message, and explained that He Jian was riding on this "Wei Sheng." Although the seven people did not know He Jian, they could of course guess; because they were a group, and He Jian was alone.

### Homecoming Poetry Notes

— Pin Baihua

Awakening Wang Wei, unable to paint it,

I can be proud that my birthplace has "famous mountains." China is a country with many mountains, but only mountains that are clear and beautiful can be called famous. Thus, the line of the immortal Li Taibai of over a thousand years, "loving famous mountains, entering Yue," is not distorted; and at the same time, he also dreamed of traveling to Mount Tianmu, the so-called place of the immortal's dream of "eighteen thousand feet," which is east of my hometown. But things often have the opposite result. For the famous mountains of my birthplace, for more than ten years, the feeling of regret has overshadowed the element of imitation, because I have long become a "person of east, west, north, and south," without the good fortune of "riding a slow horse and a low carriage to be a good person in my hometown."

However, I have finally returned. After passing "Qingfeng Ridge," the Yue Creek is like a flat practice, circling around the steep peaks. White clouds are the outer garment of the mountain spirit, aren't they? It drifts so freely past one mountain peak after another. The verdant trees reflect a few white board houses, telling me that there is a natural embrace inside, not stained with the machinations of the city. I think this not only attracts the poetic sentiment of immortals, but also makes for a very good painting, but it is too natural. Unless Wang Mojie, who has "poetry in painting," comes to paint a "Map of Yue," wouldn't it be better than the "Axial River Map" with "mountain valleys with rolling cloud momentum flying"?

The small chartered car stopped in Sheng County. I know Zongen took advantage of the remaining time to transfer cars to take a look at "Ting Yin Pavilion," but it's just a mound of earth covered with weeds. How many people in such a place can learn from Dai Andao to "carry double citrus and a bucket of wine"! Naturally, it's late autumn, where can you find yellow orioles? Just circling around the grass industry, we got on the bus to Xinchang. Shengxin is only forty miles away, and the carriage is full of local accents, but I, who have been away for more than ten years, have even changed my local accent, not to mention my temples. Especially in a cloth coat, who would recognize you? So I crouched down, afraid to hear the local accent. Gradually, the ancient mountain city of my hometown came into view. I pulled Zongen out of the car, choosing the remote road at the foot of the city, not wanting the "elders of Jiangdong" to discover this poor boy returning to his hometown looking the same as ever.

It was night, and there were no electric lights in my hometown. I remember that in the past, there was this gift of the city, but probably "restoration" is not easy! In this way, once night falls, the whole place is pitch black. In addition, 70% to 80% of the streets and houses were destroyed in the robbery fire, a scene of ruins. Although I brought a "lantern," it was still difficult to find the path. My three old houses have changed into "authentic" roof eaves, and there is nothing inside. I temporarily stayed in the empty room of the Senate.

For several days in a row, thanks to Zongen's light, eating was not a problem, because there were people inviting us to dinner every morning and evening. However, I hate that the invitations actually follow the words "Chen Inspector" with "Professor Lu." The mountain city is huge, and the number of civil servants is at most three or four thousand yuan a month, and the county magistrate is only 100,000. The show and entertainment are actually very urbanized.

Thousands of cliffs plunge, jade bathing the collar,

Awakening Wang Wei, unable to complete it;

Coming home in Confucian robes, no one recognizes me,

The rear car is afraid to hear the sounds of home!

After ten years of desolation, looking for three paths,

Wood and stone are heartless, easily change masters;

Wanting to worship the Dragon Mound, I have become an unfilial son,

Stone pass trees are planted and transformed.

A Brief History of Musicians

### Handel

— Tian

Handel, a great German musician, is as famous as Bach, another great musician in that country. The difference between the two is expressed in: Bach lived a secluded life, fully engaged in church music works, the mood in the quiet includes severity; Handel was famous throughout Europe, wrote opera works, the writing is flying and smooth. However, Handel's efforts were not in Germany, but in England, and his more important works are allowed in "Faqu". Otatorrum, the so-called "Note Song", is similar in nature to opera, but it does not appear on stage, it sings and plays itself. Handel was born in 1683 and died in 1759.

### Bach

Bach (Bach), a German, is the ancestor of modern Western music, and is as famous as Handel. Most of his works are church music, but they are often played in music. He wrote a lot throughout his life. He was born in 1685 and died in 1750.

### Accident

— Shaofu

On Christmas Day, three pairs of planes crashed in Shanghai one after another, killing and injuring more than seventy people. It is a great misfortune that this tragedy happened on this festive day!

The cause of the accident was due to heavy fog, and the plane could not identify the airport, resulting in disaster. After inspecting the wreckage of the crashed aircraft, there were no signs of fire burning, which is enough to prove that each aircraft had been circling in Shanghai for a long time, the oil had been burned out, and forced landing was the only option. On this day, only one aircraft, No. 147 of the Chinese Company, was unexpectedly lucky enough to make a forced landing at Jiangwan Airport, suffering slight damage, and the personnel on board were miraculously unharmed.

Fatalists may exaggerate and say: life and death have a number. In fact, although this misfortune is said to be unpredictable weather (heavy fog), and attributed to changes in the climate, it can still be avoided by doing one's best. We remember that when the Chinese Flying Clipper was test-flying the Pacific route, it encountered a storm in the Pacific Ocean. If it were not for perfect flight equipment, it would not have been able to complete this flight smoothly. Heavy fog is certainly a major obstacle to flight, but if radio guidance is used, and if the ground landing guidance equipment (using light or sound) is perfect, how can heavy fog affect safety?

The record of flight accidents this year is really not small. Over time, it is inevitable that the general public will become wary of air travel. Should airline companies and traffic authorities carefully study it, and assess all equipment and various responsible personnel (including drivers, telecommunications and ground personnel), so as to prevent problems before they occur? Because human life is a matter of life and death, it is absolutely impossible to be negligent. Seeking perfection is not only providing passengers with security, but also making a great contribution to the future of China's aviation industry.

### Year-End Musings

— Cishou

"Rising wind", "storming wind", "robbing wind", "falling wind", "When the strong wind rises, the people suffer!"

The thirty-fifth year of the Republic of China is about to pass. Before we welcome the arrival of the thirty-sixth year, we might as well review this year. I think about it and can't come up with a good term to give to this year, so let's give it a "nickname" and call this year the "Year of Many Winds."

Although the weather has been cold recently, there are not many winds outside. Why call it "Year of Many Winds"? Could it be that I am stirring up trouble? That's right, the meaning of wind is very broad; the wind I am talking about is neither the southeast wind nor the northwest wind, but this year's "rising wind", "storming wind", "robbing wind", and "falling wind."

First, "rising wind." Whenever a rising wind strikes, people are like they are in a daze, at a loss. After the rising wind has passed, they wake up and take a breath. But good times don't last long, and the second rising wind intensifies and follows, making people re-enter a dazed state. The common people spend their days in this endless cycle of rising winds, and I really don't know when prices will stop rising?

Then there is "storming wind." Whether you are in a theater or on a court, you can see this wind, and someone is directing it endlessly. I don't know why human nature has become so irritable. A disagreement leads to a fight, beating people until they are battered and bleeding. It's all "like it's nothing," happy to be watched by others.

The third is "robbing wind." This year, life is difficult to solve, and there are not a few people who take risks, and the robbing wind is becoming more and more intense. But there are different tricks to robbing. "Robbers and bandits" are robbing in the open, and corrupt officials and unscrupulous merchants are robbing in secret. Those who rob in the open say that they are robbing because life is difficult to solve, but what are those who rob in secret robbing for? Robbing gold, robbing US dollars, robbing supplies, robbing happily. No matter how you rob, in short, hoarding private goods will not "inflate" like currency. The more you rob, the more you use, cause and effect, robbing without end!

Finally, "falling wind." This seems to be the "壓台戲" (last act of a performance). As the end of the year approaches, falling wind is prevalent.

### Liu Jianxu, Chairman of Fujian

— Ganlai

The current Chairman of Fujian Province, Liu Jianxu, graduated from the third class of the Baoding Military Academy in the artillery branch. After leaving the school, he served in various military positions, rising from platoon leader to commander-in-chief of the army group and deputy commander of the Third War Zone. After the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, he was responsible for the pacification work on the border of Hunan and Jiangxi, and achieved the effect of destroying the bandits, which was highly praised by the superiors. During the Anti-Japanese War, he traveled to the southeast battlefield. In the Battle of Hangzhou Bay, he captured Zhenhai, and the situation in Zhejiang Province was turned from danger to safety. Later, as Chen Yi became Chairman of Fujian Province, the lost land along the coast was recovered one after another. He always adhered to the principle of "three points military, seven points politics" in his administration, and the gradual stabilization of the situation in Fujian shows that his administration has indeed achieved some results.

In mid-March of this year, Liu visited Shanghai and hosted a banquet for Fujian fellow villagers in Shanghai at the Jinmen Hotel. He himself is from Liling, Hunan, with a fat, round face, which makes him look particularly energetic.

Liu's original wife, Chen, has thirteen daughters and five sons, making a total of ten children in the family.

He is very strict in managing his family, does not allow his family to wear strange clothes, and hates gambling, and uses this as a precept to teach his daughters.

Since the twenty-fifth year of Fujian, the people have suffered from natural disasters, man-made disasters and corruption and exploitation. Now they need to rest and recover. The people all hope that Chairman Liu will work hard to govern and stabilize people's livelihood!

### In the midst of war, there is a paradise

—

The housing shortage that came with the victory has not been solved until now. The authorities seem to have put some thought into it, and the plan is one after another, residential areas, civilian villages, these are always just talk on paper.

Recently, I "Columbus" discovered a truly genuine "civilian village." Where is it? The location is in the "West Station" and "Xin Longhua" area. The residents here, as in "Peach Blossom Spring," are uncontested, working at sunrise and resting at sunset.

This place was originally wasteland, but now, shop owners complain, factory owners sigh poor, all say that the end of the year is difficult, and there is another hurdle after one is passed. These days, they have a feeling of "living like years," every day like "New Year's Eve." I think, if we don't fundamentally think about peace and stability, no matter what wise method you come up with, you can't resist this falling wind.

I don't know what wind will come after the falling wind. In short, this year is the "Year of Many Winds." To be honest, we common people do not miss this kind of year; our only hope is that next year can be "good weather and peace and prosperity for the country," and no longer make us common people suffer!

It has already become an emerging "civilian village." The newly built houses, although not three-dimensional red-tiled brick, are very neat and orderly, and each household has its own separate house, living very freely and comfortably, with bedrooms, kitchens, living rooms. In the open space outside the door, they plant beans, wheat, vegetables, and scallions. Although there is no tap water, it is not a problem to dig a pond for drinking, and each household raises some chickens, ducks, pigs, and sheep. Therefore, the New Year's dishes may not be as rich as those of the salaried people in Shanghai.

According to reports, the houses here do not need to "gold bars" to secure. They are all built by the people of northern Jiangsu themselves, and the materials needed for construction are moved from rubble yards elsewhere. Lao Mao said that he lives so comfortably without spending a penny, and he doesn't need the dangerous mouth of a second landlord, and he doesn't need to pay rent. "Donations and taxes" are unrelated to them. Although the landlord has negotiated with them, these people from northern Jiangsu really have nowhere to live. As the saying goes, only this house can keep people living, there is no tearing down the house to drive people away, and besides, everyone has a heart of compassion!

In this emerging "civilian village," there are also several village stores, tobacco paper shops, small teahouses, barbershops, and snack stalls. The sparrow is small, but it has all the organs.

From here, I see the spirit of self-reliance of the people of northern Jiangsu. The people of northern Jiangsu are all able to endure hardship and are not dependent. They can live "without asking anyone" everywhere. The children already know how to "scavenge" and sell tea and can eat and drink without relying on their parents, so I think the people of northern Jiangsu are worthy of emulation.

### Feeding the Dog with its Tail

— Galing

A tax collector made a grand speech to many people: "The government and the people are like father and son. Protecting children from being bullied by enemies, educating them, and taking care of them all require money, so it is right and proper for the people to pay taxes enthusiastically, the more the better!"

One of them listened and said, "I understand, it's like this.

"I keep a puppy. It's hungry and wags its tail at me for food. I say to it, 'Dear puppy, you must be very hungry, right? I'm really sorry, let me help you.'"

"I found a knife, cut off its little tail, and then put it in its mouth: 'Eat! My faithful good dog! Eat this piece of meat to nourish your body!'"

The tax collector stopped talking.

### The fighting heroic posture of French boxing champion Marcel Cerdan.

### Democracy and Republic

— Hu Yisheng

In China, there is only "democracy," not republic. This democracy lacking a republic is just "I am the only one who is respected," "I am here." "I" is the most beautiful "note" in the world.

Originally, the trend of the world has generally turned from individualism to collectivism, but our country is still seeking a way out in the "democracy" of individualism. What can we find? Adding a lot of "democratic gimmicks" and new bureaucrats who eat "democratic" meals, what help is there for China? Wu Zhi Lao said that to achieve world harmony, we must go through thirty-six small wars and seventy-two major wars. If this "democracy" continues, even after seventy-two small wars and one hundred and forty-four major wars, "small harmony" will not come!

I think the way out for China is not in democracy but in the republic, or at least we must say: "The republic is more important than democracy."

### Treating

— Zimin

"Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!..." A speeding car drove from afar.

A rice carrier slowly walked towards the center of the road.

"Stop! Stop! Stop!"

The rice carrier acted as if nothing had happened and continued to walk towards the center of the road.

"Ghost!" With a sharp sound, the car stopped suddenly.

A head poked out of the small window.

"Hey! Friend, are you preparing to treat?"

### The Organization of Beggars 20

— Huang Jiamo

Street Performance and Begging (Middle)

(6) "The Genuine and Fake Dumbs" -- Dumbness is a type of disability, and beggars also utilize it as a magic weapon for eliciting sympathy. However, there are genuine and fake versions, and the profession is divided into four types. They are called "Deceiving Heaven", "Shouting Mouth", "Blocking the Road", and "Acting Real". "Deceiving Heaven" refers to genuinely and truly dumb individuals, while "Shouting Mouth" are those who have learned the act. Originally, pretending to be dumb is the easiest trick, and the beggars are divided into "Blocking the Road" and "Walking the Streets" factions. They go their separate ways and do not interfere with each other. "Blocking the Road" involves kneeling by the roadside, knocking their heads on the ground, muttering words, pointing to heaven and earth, then pointing to their own mouths and hearts, patting their chests to beg. "Walking the Streets" involves begging from door to door. When the fake dumbs gather to beg, they are not allowed to chat, according to the rules. They are only allowed to speak after returning to "Yuxiang Hall" (beggar factory).

(7) "Nose Guanyin" -- This group must wear straw shoes and straw circles on their heads. "Double Dragons Entering the Sea" involves using bamboo to carve two long Yingzi, with velvet balls hanging at the ends. When begging, they insert the bamboo into their nostrils, exposing the velvet balls outside. "Genuine Dragon Mouth" refers to snake charming through the nose. Both factions are "speaking with one nostril."

(8) "Sitting on the Floor" -- Sitting on the side of the road and singing wildly. The lyrics say: "Good feet, good hands, the road to heaven; bad feet, bad hands, the gate to hell. Out in the open, coming in the dark, not a penny falls on empty ground." The singing is filled with rising and falling cadence, causing people to feel pity.

(9) "Selling Ear Picks" -- Selling bamboo ear picks along the street is another branch of the beggar gang. The gang refers to themselves as "Holding Gauze Hats," the meaning of which is unknown. However, those who work in this profession are unwilling to admit that they are beggars. Most likely because the income is not bad, they have already joined the ranks of small vendors. It is said that being able to hold a gauze hat in the right hand and independently operate a knife to manufacture ear picks with the left hand is considered a signature skill.

(10) "The Bitter Flesh Knife" -- This gang is divided into "Waist Block" and "Enclosure" types. When the waist block beggar goes on the street, he must first put on his upper body clothing, and carry a two-foot-long ring-handled knife. When he is not given money, he hits his waist hard with the knife, creating new red marks. This makes shopkeepers both surprised and pitiful, so they give money to end the matter. "Enclosure" is similar to street performers, setting up a venue in a vacant area by the roadside and begging from people. However, these people do not have the good skills of the Jianghu gang, they just bang and knock in a chaotic way, deceiving idlers and others.

(11) "Dancing with Sticks" -- Similar to the above item, belonging to the street performance category, but despised by the Jianghu gang. One type is called "Qishu," who can dance wooden sticks in a variety of ways. The other is called "Hitting Sticks," who use three short sticks, one thick and two thin, dancing along the street and begging.

(12) "The Genuine and Fake Blinds" -- There are genuine and fake dumbs, and naturally there are genuine and fake blinds. Moreover, there are more fake blinds than genuine ones. Imposters are called "Cold Look" in the gang, also a clever metaphor. They hold bamboo canes in their hands, turn their eyelids outward, and hide the black pupils. It is a wonder that they even know makeup techniques. The street cries include sentences like, "Looking up, I cannot see the road to heaven; lifting my feet, I cannot see the height of the road." Such things cannot be fully recorded. "Rotten Beauty" sitting begging also belongs to this gang. On the surface, they are covered in sores, displaying themselves on the side of the road. In reality, most of them use the makeup techniques passed down by the beggar gang. In addition, there are those who kneel by the roadside and knock their heads loudly, turning their foreheads into walnut-sized lumps. They also belong to this gang, which will be described in detail later.

### As the Year-End Approaches, Wang Xiaoer Runs Away

— Wu Shujiang

"I, Wang Xiaoer, am unfortunately named Wang, and unfortunately named Xiaoer, so in the past, people in society, when national affairs went badly, when the business market was sluggish, when they themselves were not trying hard, they all used me, Wang Xiaoer, to make fun, 'Wang Xiaoer spending the New Year,' 'getting worse year after year.'

I, Wang Xiaoer, am just a little poor, but I have never done anything to harm the country. I have never done the manipulation and speculation that unscrupulous merchants do. Why is it that when national affairs go badly, I am used to make fun, and when the business market is sluggish, I am also used to make fun? Since entering the Republic of China, it is difficult for Xiaoer to get through the New Year without hearing these insulting words. I am really angry.

Now that the War of Resistance has been won, and more than a year has passed since the victory, national affairs should gradually be on the right track, and the future of the country is nearing a splendid and glorious state. What about the business market? Under the guidance and supervision of the government, it will naturally be calm and prosperous day by day. What about the people? After this long War of Resistance and victory, they will certainly be motivated and strive to become new citizens. As I, Wang Xiaoer, greet the thirty-sixth year with national rejoicing, I formally bid farewell to the people of the country, forever bid farewell, deeply wishing that from now on there will be no Wang Xiaoer like me in society, and even more wishing that from now on, when society encounters things that go badly, no one will use me, Wang Xiaoer, to make fun."
