### Assume Responsibility and Improve Politics; Expedite the Completion of North China's Restoration: Chairman's Admonition During Memorial Week in Beiping City

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 2nd Dispatch] Chairman Chiang remained in Beiping on the 2nd, continuing to summon various department heads. At 11:00 AM on the 2nd, various institutions specially held a grand Memorial Week one day early, inviting the Chairman to personally give an admonition. After the meeting, he went to inspect the Beiping Pacification Headquarters. Shortly after, he returned to the headquarters. From 3:00 PM, he summoned the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Special Envoy Wang Jichen and other personnel from the Ministry of Economic Affairs. At 4:00 PM, he summoned Chief of Staff Wang Hongshao of the Beiping Pacification Headquarters, Secretary-General Xuan Yishan, Director of Political Affairs Wang Jiesan, Chief of Staff Song Kentang of the Eleventh War Zone, Deputy Chiefs of Staff Lu Wenzhen and Gao Songyuan, Director of the Political Department Zhao Kefu, Deputy Director of the Beiping Police Bureau Zhu Nanping, and others for an admonition. In the evening, there was a tea party to meet with local gentry, celebrities, and guests in Beiping. Tou Weigou, who had rushed back to Beiping, was specially invited to host. The reporter saw the Chairman using a blue pen to circle the names of those permitted to be received by Ms. Sheng (Soong Mei-ling, Chiang's wife), including Wan Fulin, Ma Zhanshan, Feng Qinzai, and Li Shouxin. In addition, Mrs. Zhang Zizhong was also permitted to meet with the Chairman and Madam tomorrow morning. The Chairman's actions in Beiping are meticulous and swift. In just a few days, all aspects have been taken care of. Each room in the headquarters is equipped with an electric bell, and the attendants are prepared to act at any moment. Within nine minutes of the bell ringing, they are ready to depart.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 2nd Dispatch] Chairman Chiang attended yesterday's expanded Memorial Week in Beiping City on the 2nd, giving many instructions regarding politics in North China. The key points were: (1) The military and political steps in Beiping and Tianjin are quite disorganized and should be unified in the future. Director Li of the Pacification Headquarters is asked to take responsibility. (2) Political conduct urgently needs to be reformed, transforming passivity into activity, and seeking merit instead of avoiding fault. (3) The reception work in Beiping and Tianjin is too disorganized, with many unreasonable phenomena. A thorough investigation should be conducted in the future, and each senior official is only allowed to enjoy a five-room residence. (4) Key personnel who collaborated with the enemy in the past must be investigated. (5) The city government must pay attention to the health of citizens, improve public health, and quickly remove accumulated soil throughout the city. (6) The quality of police officers in the police bureau is uneven and should be improved. The central government will increase funding for police administration. The admonition lasted one hour. The grand Memorial Week for party, government, and military affairs on the 2nd was held in Huai Ren Tang in Zhongnanhai. More than 200 personnel from the party, government, and military departments of Beiping, Tianjin, and Baoding attended. Sun Lianzhong arrived at the venue at 9:00 AM to take care of arrangements. At 11:00 AM, Chairman Chiang, accompanied by Li Zongren and his entourage, arrived. The Chairman was unarmored, wearing a military uniform, and looking radiant. All personnel stood up and paid respects to the Chairman upon his arrival. The Chairman gladly returned the salute and then presided over the meeting, which adjourned around 12:00 PM.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 2nd Dispatch] The party, government, military, and police circles of Beiping held a joint Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week at Huai Ren Tang at 11:00 AM this morning. After Chairman Chiang led the ceremony in accordance with the rituals, he delivered an impromptu speech. He first emphasized that Beiping is one of the most important cities in the country, and all comrades working here should be aware of the gravity of their responsibilities. Currently, the restoration work in North China is not progressing as expected due to economic difficulties and transportation obstructions. However, within the possible range, we must take the initiative to find ways to overcome difficulties and have a spirit of perseverance and fearlessness of hardship, so that we can complete the great task of national construction after the destruction. Chairman Chiang then pointed out that the current mentality of general civil servants seeking only to avoid fault rather than striving for merit is detrimental. Only by working hard and bearing complaints can affairs be promoted. Finally, the Chairman gave concrete instructions on the economic, educational, health, and police aspects of Beiping City, especially on the health aspect, believing that the police bureau must assist in mobilizing the public to automatically remove accumulated waste and request cleanliness in order to be effective. The speech lasted about forty minutes.

[United Press, Beiping, 2nd Dispatch] Chairman Chiang and his wife are scheduled to return to Nanjing by plane tomorrow. The local women's association plans to present Madam Chiang with a silk banner to publicly praise her contributions to the country.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 2nd Dispatch] Chairman Chiang specially awarded 500,000 yuan to all police officers in Beiping today to commend their excellent service since the recovery of the city.

### The Nation Reaches a Critical Juncture of Prosperity and Decline; the Overall Situation Can No Longer Be Delayed; the Resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference Must Be Implemented Swiftly

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd Dispatch] According to a certain important official who told our newspaper's reporter, based on observations of various news from inside and outside the passes over the past week, the most noteworthy issue at present is no longer the so-called issue of war or peace, but the issue of the nation's prosperity and decline, and the survival of the Chinese people. We should know that since the victory, the communists have been scheming to seize power, first destroying roads inside and outside the passes, expanding their armies, destroying industrial and mining production, and obstructing the government's restoration of order, military reorganization, and restoration of transportation, resulting in the decline of production and soaring prices everywhere, creating today's severe economic crisis, and even openly using force to obstruct the government's takeover, occupying the areas along the Chinese Changchun Railway, stealing political power under the guise of public opinion, not only hindering the government's fulfillment of its obligations under Article 4 of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance regarding the joint operation of the Chinese Changchun Railway, but also plunging tens of millions of compatriots in the Northeast who have been oppressed by the enemy and puppets for fourteen years into a desperate situation due to the destruction of transportation and the shutdown of factories. Although the government has repeatedly sought peace through concessions and convened consultative conferences to jointly seek solutions for the country, the communists have deeply hidden their evil intentions, outwardly displaying peace while secretly plotting to seize power, going back on their word and changing constantly regarding the resolutions of the consultative conferences, such as the cessation of hostilities and the restoration of roads, and the agreement on the government's reorganization after the convocation of a national assembly. This is truly unfathomable. Their intention is nothing more than a treacherous tactic of turning the situation upside down in order to achieve the purpose of delaying the current situation, dragging the country into fragmentation, exhausting the government, plunging the people into misery, and confusing allies who eagerly hope for China's peaceful unification, so as to achieve their goal of taking advantage of the situation to enrich themselves in terms of economic and political power. Fortunately, the government, the people, and friendly allies now have a new understanding of the current situation, and deeply feel that only by restoring national transportation and reorganizing and unifying the armed forces can the current economic crisis in China be saved. If we continue to delay and make mistakes, not only will our international status decline day by day, but if the overall situation continues to deteriorate due to prolonged transportation blockages, agricultural abandonment, factory closures, and industrial decline, and once natural disasters and man-made disasters combine to torment us, our 450 million compatriots will have nowhere to die. If the Chinese people recognize this crisis that must be quickly averted, they should know that the measures currently taken by the government are necessary. What the government currently hopes from the communists, such as the restoration of transportation and the reorganization and unification of the armed forces, are all matters that were resolved and awaiting implementation by the first government consultative conference. If the above resolutions cannot be implemented, what is the use of holding another hundred consultative conferences? The official continued, "Whenever our government reaches a critical juncture, its decisions concerning the great plan to save the nation have never been indecisive. He deeply believes that after the Chairman returns to Nanjing, all discussions must be based on this principle for research and implementation, so as not to waste time.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 2nd Dispatch] A reliable source confirmed today that General Marshall has drafted a new peace plan to resolve the civil strife in the Northeast, but the details are kept secret.

[Another Dispatch] Da Gang Daily stated in today's war bulletin: "The Chairman has formulated three new suggestions for resolving the civil strife in the Northeast: (1) Stop the National Army's actions, (2) The Communist Army withdraws from Harbin and Qiqihar, (3) Send administrative officials to the areas controlled by the Communist Army."

[Reuters, Nanjing, 2nd Dispatch] Luo Longji, a spokesman for the Democratic League, stated: "Today, measures are being drafted to break the deadlock between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, but the details are not yet convenient for publication. The scope of the dispute between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is not as extensive as generally believed. Both sides have agreed that they must face the difficulties. The Democratic League and Marshall are now making every effort to break this deadlock. The attitudes of both sides are not completely devoid of hope." Yu Dawei, the newly appointed Minister of Transportation, also remained silent about the content of his talks with Marshall when meeting with others, only stating: "General opinions have been exchanged." Yu also stated that the Communist Party should fulfill its treaty obligations to restore transportation.

[United Press, Nanjing, 2nd Dispatch] Reliable sources from both sides of this issue stated today that Marshall has a new peace plan [to reconcile the demands of both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party], but it is believed that the opportunity for lasting peace remains weak.

### National Army Advancing Towards Harbin in Several Columns; Xiong Shihui Inspects Changchun from Shenyang

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd Dispatch] Army Headquarters: The main force of the Northeast National Army, 30,000 men, has been selected to enter the strategic zone on the Chang-Ha Railway in Jilin Province, near the Erdaohezi. All strategic areas have been captured. The National Army can now enter Harbin at any time. According to news from Beiping, the Central Government is currently expressing plans to hold Harbin firmly, but this plan has not been noticed by the people. However, the Communist Army is indeed making a desperate struggle in Anshan and other places.

[Associated Press, Northeast National Army Headquarters, 2nd Dispatch] General Du Yuming's advance guard is advancing towards Harbin. According to authoritative sources here tonight, they discovered that the Communist Army has blown up a major bridge on the Songhua River, 75 miles south of Harbin. The bridge is over a mile long and is a suspension bridge spanning the southern tributary of the Songhua River, forming a water defense line for Harbin and a necessary route for Du's lightning advance into Harbin. The bombing of the bridge may indicate that the Communist Army intends to hold the north bank of the Songhua River.

### Government Decides to Follow Signed Agreements; Military Reorganization Ratio Unchanged; Chairman Instructs on Military Mediation Work

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 1st Dispatch] (Delayed) After Chairman Chiang arrived in Beiping, he summoned the government representatives of the Military Mediation Department, and gave important instructions regarding national mediation work. These instructions essentially represent the government's attitude towards the current situation. The main points are: (1) The government sincerely strives for national peace and unity. (2) The government will absolutely abide by all agreements and protocols signed with the Communist Party. (3) The Communist Party must also fulfill the agreements and protocols that it has signed. Regarding the Northeast issue, the government believes: (1) According to the Sino-Soviet treaty and the truce agreement, the National Government should have the exclusive right to take over sovereignty in the Northeast. (2) The Northeast Communist Army should comply with the military reorganization agreement, concentrate and await reorganization. The ratio of military reorganization in the Northeast should not be changed. When asked if the government intended to designate the area north of the Xing'an Mountains as a defense zone for the Communist Army, the spokesman replied that he had not heard of this, but if the Communist Army agreed to the reorganization, the government should designate a concentration point. In addition, the reporter learned today that the Executive Headquarters has not strengthened the preparation for mediation in the Northeast. Recently, the Communist Party proposed sending a group to Changchun, which was supported by the US, but the government has not yet agreed. The government stated that when the Communist Army attacked Changchun, the government proposed sending a group to Changchun, which was rejected by the Communist Party, so it seems unnecessary now. Another government spokesman told reporters that the Northeast is not an apple, but a plate of apples, which can be sliced and eaten separately, but the plate cannot have a missing piece, implying that the sovereignty of the Northeast cannot be divided.

The 145th Division of the garrison has set up reception centers at the Suzhou Railway Station and the Lexiang Hotel, and because the inspection site is built in Mubin, it is necessary to use the Su-Fu Highway, and the road is uneven and unsuitable for vehicles. Therefore, a special work committee leader was sent to Suzhou. Immediately after arriving in Suzhou, the Youth Association will hold a joint meeting inviting relevant parties to attend.

### "Return the Government's Army to the State"--Minister Bai Talks about the Organization and Tasks of the Ministry of National Defense

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd Dispatch] The Ministry of National Defense was officially established on the 1st, and the first Minister, General Bai Chongxi, has taken office. Bai told reporters about the organization and tasks of the ministry, stating: "The military period of our revolution has reached its final stage. Therefore, we are now preparing to implement constitutional government, abolish the Military Affairs Commission, which is separated from the Executive Yuan, and establish the Ministry of National Defense, which is subordinate to the Executive Yuan, to achieve the revolutionary goal of 'returning the government's army to the state.' Moreover, because the military is governed by the government, warlike soldiers like those in Germany and Japan will never have the possibility of rising to power. This is truly a fundamental and unshakable system for the nation for centuries to come." The organizational spirit of the Ministry of National Defense has two major characteristics: (1) To closely link military administration with politics, and to coordinate political strategy with military strategy. (2) To unify military administration and military command of the army, navy, and air force. Xiang also listed the current military tasks of the Ministry of National Defense, which are based on the constitution, in which the head of state commands the army, navy, and air force. Therefore, all matters concerning military command are ordered by the head of state and planned and directed by the Chief of Staff. The implementation of the National Defense Force regarding military administrative matters, within the scope of decision-making, is based on the orders of the Executive Yuan by the Ministry of National Defense, and is planned and directed by the Chief of Staff. The important tasks of the current National Defense Force are: (1) Establish a national defense plan. The Ministry of National Defense is the national defense advisory body to the President of the Executive Yuan. All national defense measures are initiated by the Ministry of National Defense or first handed over to the Ministry of National Defense for planning, and then ordered to various departments to complete them on schedule. (2) Develop national defense industries. Without industry, there is no national defense. The Ministry of National Defense will propose a comprehensive plan for the degree and speed of development of national defense industries in accordance with national defense needs, so that it can be gradually completed. (3) Establish the most modern national defense force. Although there are many national defense tasks, the military is ultimately at its center. The Ministry of National Defense will establish a plan to equip and improve the academic and skill levels of officers and soldiers, and supervise its implementation. (4) Scientific research and general science are now inseparable. The Ministry of National Defense intends to directly contribute to national defense science.

### Signed Agreements, Government Decides to Follow Through, Military Reorganization Ratios Unchanged, Chairman Instructs on Military Mediation Work

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 1st Dispatch] (Delayed) After Chairman Chiang arrived in Beiping, he summoned government officials in charge of the military mediation department and gave important instructions regarding the national mediation work. These instructions basically reflect the government's attitude toward the current situation. The main points are: (1) The government sincerely strives for national peace and unity. (2) The government will absolutely abide by all agreements and protocols signed with the Communist Party. (3) The Communist Party also [must] implement its already signed agreements and protocols. Regarding the Northeast issue, the government believes: (1) According to the Sino-Soviet Treaty and the truce agreement, the National Government should have the exclusive right to receive the sovereignty of the Northeast. (2) The Communist Army in the Northeast should comply with the military reorganization agreement and concentrate to await reorganization. The ratio of military reorganization in the Northeast should not be changed. When asked if the government intended to designate the area north of the Xing'an Mountains as a defense zone for the Communist Army, the spokesman replied that he had not heard of this, but if the Communist Army listens to the reorganization, the government [will] designate a central location. Furthermore, a reporter found out today that the Executive Department had not yet strengthened the preparations for mediation in the Northeast. Recently, the Communist Party suggested sending a small group of twenty-eight people to Changchun, which the U.S. supported, but the government has not yet agreed. The government side stated that when the Communist Army attacked Changchun, the government side proposed sending a small group to Changchun, which was rejected by the Communist Party, so it does not seem necessary today. Another government spokesperson told the reporter that the Northeast is not an apple, but a plate of apples. It can be cut into slices and eaten, but the plate will not be a plate if there is a defect. This is to convey that the sovereignty of the Northeast cannot be divided.

### The Culprit Who Disturbed China: An Observation of Sakai's Trial by Our Beijing Correspondent Zhang Ming

The mastermind of the July 7th Incident, the spark that ignited the world, this unforgivable butcher—Sakai Takashi, recorded as Case Number 5 of the Detective Office—is being tried in Nanjing!

The Military Tribunal of the Army Headquarters is trying its first case today, and the one marking the beginning is precisely the culprit who has disturbed our land from the Changbai Mountains to the Yangtze River for the past fifteen years. After this news spread, many people hoped to witness the scene of this butcher being sanctioned, especially the journalists, who had already contacted for admission tickets to the hearing.

At eight in the morning, people began to arrive one after another. The military headquarters, a place usually heavily guarded and off-limits to idlers, was today taking in crowds of people in various forms of plain clothes. The opening of the trial was scheduled for nine o'clock but was delayed until nine forty. The presiding judge, Shi Meiyu; assessors Meng Chuanda, Gao Qimai, and Bao Qiwei; prosecutor Chen Guangwei; and the secretary and translators arrived at the court. Soon after, Sakai arrived at the court escorted by two soldiers and two court officers. This old man was sixty years old. Although thin, he still tried to appear energetic. When he entered, his feigned composure seemed to emanate an indelible air of murderous intent, conveyed through the gaze behind his nearsighted glasses. He was wearing a dark blue serge Western suit and a khaki shirt, but the collar was unbuttoned, and the tie was not tied. He had short hair, a short beard, and rimless glasses, with a frighteningly gaunt face. His build was naturally not tall but not too short. After standing in the defendant's seat, he first put down the two books he had brought. Then, the photographers began to compete for shots, and the flashes of light flashed in all directions, leaving countless photos of this unforgivable war criminal in the soft whirring of the cameras, adding an air of mystery.

During the opening of the trial, he stood the whole time. While listening to the prosecutor read the indictment, he looked around from side to side, trying to find his sympathizers in the crowd. At the same time, because the full text of the indictment was very long, the reading took twenty-five minutes. First, it was read in Chinese, then in Japanese. He pondered as he listened, and took out paper and pen to take notes. Sometimes he smiled with an extremely contemptuous and cunning attitude, as if these were not surprising at all. In this way, it continued for nearly an hour.

The interrogation began. As usual, he was first asked his name and age. He was from Guangdong. He lived in Tokyo. A sixty-year-old man from Guangdong, living in Tokyo. An old man who should have compassion in his heart. But he had been a butcher, and he had not admitted his mistakes or awakened even now.

Regarding the questioning about his past positions in the war against China, he sometimes responded with "Yes," and sometimes said, "I don't remember clearly, maybe yes," or perhaps said, "Probably yes," all delivered with a cunning attitude. Under this atmosphere, the interrogation continued for a whole morning. Everyone felt unhappy, and a fire-like rage almost burst towards him, but he was still so slow and composed.

One exchange went like this:

"Do you admit that the three northeastern provinces are Chinese territory?"

"They are Chinese territory."

"Since they are Chinese territory, why did you force our military leaders to recognize the puppet Manchukuo as 'Manzhouguo'?"

"I hope you can provide evidence."

The presiding judge then declared: There are many pieces of evidence, and he told him the time, but he still responded with an unbelievable attitude.

Regarding his repeated participation in invading our country, he said, "I am a soldier, I only know how to obey orders, and the responsibility should be borne by the national government." He repeatedly said, "The July 7th Incident was not a war, and the Japanese also did not want war. The Japanese were asking for survival." He also said, "This is all accumulated misunderstandings," completely denying the truth. The prosecutor once retorted, "Do you demand survival by making others unable to survive?" In reality, this is a kind of sophistry. He wants people to listen to him and allow him to take what he wants, so that he, an individual, can live on alone.

When asked how many Chinese people he had slaughtered, he said he didn't know at all, and even said, "I have always instructed my subordinates not to kill people casually."

Regarding his crimes, the court divided them into the following parts:

The first part concerned all the acts of aggression in North China before the "July 7th Incident," for which the defendant was the main instigator. The second part was that the "July 7th Incident" itself was mainly orchestrated by the defendant. The third part was all the various crimes committed by the army during the war, such as raping women, mass killings of Chinese and British people, and enslaving the people.

The first part of the aggression involved economic, political, and military aggressive actions, all of which were supported by various pieces of evidence sufficient to prove it. The second part was that the defendant created a military fait accompli, forcing the outbreak of war. The third part involved the massacres in Guangzhou and Hong Kong, which were too horrible to describe. If we count the number of people killed as 500,000, then only four or five war criminals can be named. Isn't it said that one person's life is exchanged for ten thousand?

But he repeatedly quibbled, and when the trial continued in the afternoon and the debate began, the defendant completely and falsely denied everything.

But the prosecutor said this: Our reasons are: (1) On behalf of millions of Chinese compatriots who were brutally murdered, we request the presiding judge to sentence the defendant to death; (2) For the threat to the survival of the nation and the suffering of the Chinese nation, we request the presiding judge to sentence the defendant to death; (3) To ensure lasting world peace, please sentence the defendant to death. When this paragraph of reasoning was translated into Japanese and sent into his ears, he immediately became somber, and his eyes shook blankly, no longer having the dismissive arrogance he had in the morning. In his deceitful brain, he still has a very good pattern of aggression!

But he continued to make illegal demands to the presiding judge: (1) Please allow a Japanese to be the translator; (2) I hope to present concrete evidence and extend the sentencing date. The presiding judge immediately rejected his request and did not grant it.

Next, Wang Long, the defense lawyer appointed by the court for the defendant, stood up to defend him, debating from both factual and legal perspectives, but neither could be established.

Finally, the defendant tried to salvage the situation, saying that everything was still due to threats. Then the prosecutor said, "China's military strength is not enough to defend itself, how can it threaten the survival of the Japanese? China is almost equal to the Japanese market. How can it pose an economic threat to the Japanese? The 'July 7th Incident' was clearly created by Japan single-handedly, how can you say you don't know?"

This insidious, cunning, and evil-doing person, because he obtained his error from his nerves, did not submit, but could not help but bow to the principle of public justice, ending the interrogation.

The presiding judge announced that the verdict would be announced on the 30th, but afterwards, after consultation among the judges, it was deemed unnecessary to debate further, and the date was temporarily changed, but it is said that this case must be cleared before June 15th!

### New Scientific Discovery: Penicillin Can Be Chemically Synthesized

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] Report from the China Society of Natural Sciences:

(1) In the past, the production of penicillin relied on extraction from the cultivation of fungi, resulting in high costs and inability to be universally available. Recently, through the research of the Medical Research Group of the U.S. Scientific Research and Development Bureau and British medical research, crystalline penicillin can be produced from streptomycin. If mercury is added to remove a molecule of carbon dioxide, it can become a kind of cephalosporin. Its chemical structure has been clarified, and it is expected that it can soon be synthesized artificially through chemical methods, without having to rely on the production of cephalosporin fungi anymore, and its cost will definitely be greatly reduced.

(2) The Army Department invented a mapping device during the war that was extremely precise. It could be placed behind soldiers or any other objects and automatically record direction and distance based on movement, automatically forming large-scale maps. The scale could be from one ten-thousandth to one five-hundred-thousandth. This device had a great effect on military affairs during the war, and will also be widely used in geographical surveys and exploration work in the future.

According to the experiments of Professor Coles of the University of Illinois, the killing power of this drug is three to four times greater than "DDT" for killing flies, and five to ten times greater for killing grasshoppers, which has a great effect on agricultural work.

The reporter went to visit President Sun of the High Court in the afternoon, but he had gone to Songjiang for inspection. Therefore, he turned to visit Chief Han. The answer to the question of whether the judgment books for traitors Chen and Chu had been delivered was ambiguous, saying that he did not know the details, but he firmly denied that he had received the execution order.

### A Tragedy in Qilin Township, Wujin: Village Head Murders Four Children with His Own Hands, Suffers Severe Trauma and Develops Mental Illness

[Our Newspaper, Changzhou, 2nd] Huang Zhongxiu, a villager from Mao Sanfangtou Village near Qujia Lane, No. 2 Bao, Qilin Township, Sixth District of Wujin, is over forty years old and serves as the village head of this Bao. He is cautious and taciturn. He has three sons and two daughters. In November of last year, because villager Huang Songquan plotted to become the director of the Shuixian Police Bureau, he urgently needed funds and was forced to borrow twenty dan of rice from Huang Shengzu's wife, a member of his clan, on behalf of Songquan. The price per dan was only a few yuan. This year, when Songquan repaid the loan, Shengzu's wife insisted on returning the original rice, otherwise each dan would have to be priced at 20,000 yuan. Zhongxiu had to compensate more than 300,000 yuan. He had no choice but to sell an acre of land and use the money to pay off the debt. As a result, he was filled with anger and worried about the loss of livelihood, and suffered excessive trauma, and developed mental illness. At around 6:00 AM on the 31st of last month, taking advantage of his wife's absence to wash rice on the riverbank, his three sons and one daughter were still asleep (the eldest daughter, 26 years old, did not stay at home that day). He suddenly had murderous intent, first locked the door, turned around and held a sharp blade, and continuously slashed at the fourteen-year-old eldest son, the twelve-year-old second son, the ten-year-old youngest son, and the four-year-old youngest daughter. For a time, heads were split open, necks were severed, legs were broken, and intestines were flowing, and blood and flesh covered the bed. After the second son was severely wounded, he was still able to quickly get up to the door and pull the door open to escape, but it was too late. His head was split into two pieces, his brains burst out and he fell to the ground. A family of four died, a tragic scene. When the wife of the murderer, Huang Zhang, returned home and saw this, she was shocked, unable to cry. She reported to the neighborhood chief and others, who escorted the murderer Huang Zhongxiu to the Sixth District Office in the town. The district chief, Li Youwei, interrogated him, and Huang Zhongxiu directly admitted to hacking and killing three of his own sons and one daughter. When asked why he did such a tragic thing, he said, "I suffer because I am honest. At the time, I thought that if my children grew up in the future, they would be as honest as me, and they would definitely suffer in this evil world, so I quickly killed them all." The district chief, according to the confession, prepared a document and presented the murderer to the county government for review. After the incident occurred, according to informed sources in the township, Huang Zhongxiu's murder of four children is worthy of pity. They believed that in this case, they should request to waive the inspection of the bodies of the victims and should not fail to report the case. Also, Huang Zhongxiu usually acted honestly and sincerely. When the members of the district self-defense team arrested him, they all lamented the misfortune of this mentally ill patient. Hundreds of villagers even pleaded for him to be released, and Huang Zhang also volunteered to follow her husband into prison to prevent him from committing suicide.

Editorial

### The Mission of the Ministry of National Defense

The Ministry of National Defense was established on June 1st, with Minister Bai Chongxi and Chief of General Staff Chen Cheng already assuming their duties. Simultaneously, former Chief of General Staff and Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Army, General He Yingqin, sent a nationwide telegram to all military officers, expressing unanimous support for this new system. This marks a new chapter in the modern military history of China. This reform can be seen not only as a major military reform since the founding of the Whampoa Military Academy but also as an important advancement in China's political system and military organization. What the entire nation of China hopes for today is the nationalization of the military and the democratization of politics. In other words, to implement military consolidation to achieve the unification of military administration and command, to separate the military from the party and the military from the people, and to lay the foundation for the implementation of democratic politics. The government's abolishment of the Military Affairs Commission and the Ministry of Military Affairs this time, and replacing them with the Ministry of National Defense, not only transforms the wartime military organization into a peacetime organization but also establishes a relationship of subordination between the military and administrative organizations, which has a significant impetus for the nationalization of the military and the democratization of politics. As Chief of General Staff Chen said, "The establishment of the Ministry of National Defense this time is an epoch-making reorganization in China's military organization, adopting the military system of democratic countries and subordinating the military to politics." Therefore, the establishment of the Ministry of National Defense has great significance both militarily and politically.

In terms of China's military-political system, not to mention the arrogance of the warlords of the Northern Warlord era, even from the time of the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army until now, for the past twenty years, the central military organization has been directly under the National Government. This may have been due to the military needs of the revolutionary period and the war against foreign aggression. Although there was also a Ministry of Military Affairs under the Executive Yuan in the past, it was purely a military administrative organization. Moreover, due to the confusion between military administration and command, its powers were even more limited. The Ministry of Military Affairs also had to be under the command of the Military Affairs Commission. Therefore, before the establishment of the Ministry of National Defense, China's military administration was almost unrelated to the administration. This system is ultimately a wartime system, and now that the war of resistance has ended, there is a need to change course. Generally, people believe that the following four aspects of China's current military issues urgently need reform: (1) The military belongs to the state, ensuring the unification of military administration and command. (2) Military establishment, implementing the separation of the military from the party and the military from the people, improving military education, enriching equipment, and improving the personnel management system to build a modern national army. (3) Improving the conscription system. (4) All national troops (including the National Army and the Communist Army) should be reorganized in accordance with the disarmament plan. However, the prerequisite for solving these problems is to establish a sound and rational military organization. The accelerated establishment of the Ministry of National Defense this time has its important significance here.

As for the tasks that the Ministry of National Defense should undertake in the future, it goes without saying that everyone knows that they must be extremely important. In today's situation in China, if a modern army cannot be established in the future, it will be impossible to maintain the survival of the nation-state, let alone take on the responsibility of maintaining peace and security in the Far East and even the world. We believe that the Ministry of National Defense should at least strive to accomplish the following things:

First, it is necessary to truly achieve the nationalization of the military, which is a prerequisite for establishing a modern national army. Looking around the world's major powers, although there are factional divisions in politics, there is absolutely no difference in the military. The command authority belongs entirely to the state, and there is no such thing as a "private army." Moreover, personnel changes in politics may be more frequent, while personnel and organizational changes in the military are rare. In the relationship between the military and politics of major powers, not only must the military obey politics, but the military is also above the vortex of political struggles and is rarely affected by political changes. The reason is very simple, because the military is originally the only tool to guarantee the independent survival of the nation-state. In today's complex international relations, crises are everywhere, and there is a possibility of war at any time. If any country does not have the power of self-defense, it is not enough to survive in this world. The so-called "survival of the fittest" is even more obvious in today's atomic age. If the nationalization of China's military cannot be achieved in the future, a modern national army cannot be established. Therefore, whether the military can be nationalized is the key to China's survival. After the establishment of the Ministry of National Defense, the first thing to do is how to nationalize the national army. No one can deny that the current political stalemate in the country and the resurgence of the war in the Northeast are due to the fact that the military has not yet been nationalized. If we want to ask about the specific methods of nationalizing the military, then we can answer that it has already been agreed upon in the Political Consultative Conference. As long as we sincerely implement the Program for Peaceful National Reconstruction, as long as the government and the Chinese Communist Party simultaneously implement it in earnest, it will not be difficult to fulfill the mission of the Ministry of National Defense.

Second, we must concentrate all our efforts on building national defense. In the past, China's doors were wide open, with almost no national defense to speak of. Once the Japanese invaders launched a war of aggression, they drove straight into the interior of China, almost unstoppable. How can we ignore such a severe historical lesson! Judging from China's current international environment, we should "mend the fold after a sheep is lost," and we must not harbor any僥幸 mentality. Furthermore, major powers are concentrating on national defense construction, and China needs to catch up urgently. For example, the Soviet Union, after the war, its international position was already secure, but the Soviet authorities still haggle over the expansion of the "security zone" to serve as a buffer zone in case of another war. In the United States, the secret of the atomic bomb is kept secret and absolutely not made public, and it has built naval and air bases all over the world, still not enough, and it also wants to maintain the wartime standard of its domestic army, navy, and air force. All of this is for the security of the country, all for the national defense of the country. Of course, we have heard Bernath's call to reduce the military and Einstein's proposal to establish a world government, but we must know that a country without a national defense foundation is not qualified to talk about these high-sounding theories. Therefore, the Ministry of National Defense must concentrate all its efforts on building national defense, and the Chinese people must also follow the example of Soviet national construction, tighten their belts, and support the government in building national defense.

Third, to build a new army, we must implement military consolidation, and to implement military consolidation, we must adopt the principle of elite troops. Emphasis on quality over quantity. The Chinese army, in terms of quantity, is unmatched by any country in the world, but in terms of quality, it lags far behind! During the War of Resistance, in order to launch a comprehensive defense, it was necessary to have such a large unit, but today, having a large army is of no benefit to national defense. The financial burden of providing for them is heavy, and it is enough to strangle the economy and hinder the country's construction and progress. Therefore, we advocate the principle of elite troops. However, we must not forget that the officers and soldiers who are laid off have fought to the death for the country during the War of Resistance and have made great contributions to protecting the country and defending the people. We must properly arrange for them so that they can all get what they need in terms of life, education, and spirit.

In short, the establishment of the Ministry of National Defense is a major reform in the system, but the most important thing is "it depends on people." At the time of the establishment of the Ministry of National Defense, we greatly admire the graceful demeanor of former Chief of General Staff He, which sets an example for meritorious generals, and hope that the newly appointed Minister Bai and Chief of General Staff Chen will bury themselves in hard work and make further efforts for China's military construction. A strong China is the cornerstone of world peace, and the Ministry of National Defense has a great responsibility to make China strong.

### Western Countries Problem Investigation Committee Proposes the United Nations Should Sever Diplomatic Relations with Spain; Franco is a Potential Threat to Peace

[Reported by this newspaper] London, 2nd - Broadcast: Today, all morning newspapers in Madrid prominently published the recommendations of the Security Council's sub-committee investigating Franco's Spain, advocating that the United Nations sever diplomatic relations with Spain unless the Franco regime falls. The leader of the Franco regime's propaganda work, contrary to past practice, believes that such attacks are beneficial to maintaining the Franco regime and therefore publishes them.

[United Press, New York, 1st] The United Nations' Spanish Problem Investigation Committee today expressed moral condemnation of the Franco government and recommended that the Security Council refer the Spanish problem to the United Nations' highest body, the General Assembly, for handling. The committee declared the Franco regime a "possible threat to international peace" and proposed that the world universally sever diplomatic relations with Spain unless the Franco government is replaced by September of this year. The report recommends that the Security Council submit this matter to the 51-nation General Assembly to be held in New York on September 3rd. Ask the General Assembly to demand that all member states sever diplomatic relations with Spain unless the Franco regime "retires". Although the Franco regime does not currently threaten peace, its actions are sufficient to cause a threat. In addition, the report recommends that the Security Council endorse the joint anti-Franco declaration made by the United Kingdom, France, and the United States in March, which calls on the Spanish people to overthrow Franco by peaceful means and establish an interim government until free elections are held. All five members of the committee, except Poland and Brazil, which adopted a reserved attitude, unanimously endorsed this report. Poland, the original proposer of the case, adopted a reserved attitude towards the report, and the Brazilian representative also adopted a reserved attitude. It is recommended that the case be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly, and that the General Assembly call on all member states to sever diplomatic relations with Franco. The investigation report proposes that after the Franco regime is overthrown, and after other free conditions, such as the release of political prisoners, the recall of exiled Spaniards, freedom of political assembly, and free and open elections, are satisfactorily fulfilled, the United Nations should invite Spain to join as a member state.

The Investigation Committee found the following facts: (1) The Franco regime is a "fascist regime"; (2) During the war, Franco provided substantial assistance to the enemy countries; (3) Franco colluded with Hitler and Mussolini to launch a war against the United Nations; (4) Since the end of the war, Franco has refused to cooperate in eliminating the remnants of European fascism and Nazism in several incidents; (5) The Franco regime continues to persecute political enemies; (6) The number of armed personnel is far greater than expected by any peace-loving and non-aggressive country.

The report does not mention the allegation by Poland and the Spanish government in exile that the Franco government is engaged in atomic research with the assistance of German scientists.

The report has been distributed to the eleven member states of the Security Council and will be submitted for discussion at the next meeting, which is scheduled for around the 5th of this month.

### Monarchy or Republic? The Italian People Vote Enthusiastically; The Results Will Not Be Revealed Within This Week; Conflicts Occur Between Two Parties in Milan

"United Press, Rome, 2nd" - The Italian people flocked to the polling stations this morning and voted enthusiastically to choose between monarchy and republic and to elect a constituent assembly. According to a statement by the Ministry of the Interior, the results of the vote will not be revealed until after the 7th of this month. The number of women participating in this vote is unprecedented. Some people witnessed Prime Minister Gasperi, leader of the Christian Democratic Party, voting in the capital, but it is not known whether King Umberto II voted. Police patrolled the city of Rome in electric trams and trucks, but there were no accidents. However, it was reported that in Milan, a bomb exploded in the offices of the Communist and Socialist newspapers at 2 a.m. today, injuring three workers and causing a fire.

[United Press, Rome, 1st] On the eve of the Italian referendum to decide whether to abolish the monarchy, clashes have already occurred between the monarchist and republican parties in Milan today. When King Umberto II of Italy appeared at the entrance of the Milan Auditorium, the demonstrators outside had broken through the police defense line, and he had to return by a side road. In addition to deciding on the monarchy and republic, voters in Italy will also elect representatives to the constituent assembly to draft the new Italian political, social, and economic principles. This is the first free election since Mussolini implemented his dictatorship. There are more female voters than male voters. About 13 million men have the right to vote, and about 15 million women.

[French News Agency, Rome, 1st] If the Republican Party has a majority in the Italian referendum, the Italian royal family will leave the country. According to the decision made at the meeting between Prime Minister Gasperi and Lieutenant General Leish, the Executive Member of the Allied Control Commission, the royal family will leave the country through the port of Genoa.

### The Population Birth Rate is Too Fast; The Earth Can No Longer Hold Us; The World Now Has a Population of 2 Billion

[United Press, Washington, 1st] The US Population Census Bureau announced today that the world's current population is 2 billion. If the current birth and death rates are used, it will increase to 20 billion within 300 years, and 45 more Earths will be needed to accommodate it. The countries with the highest population birth rates in the world are China and India. Although a quarter of the population born in India between 1930 and 1940 died at around two years old, it still increased by 50 million people in ten years. If the country's mortality rate is reduced to the US level, Indians can reproduce to at least five Earths of the current size within 100 years, and so can China.

### French Election Forecast: The Right Wing Has a Chance to Rebuild Its Strength

[French News Agency, Paris, 1st] France is scheduled to hold general elections tomorrow. Political observers here are struggling to predict which of the two major parties, the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, will have the upper hand. It is generally believed that the Radical Socialist Party, which was in a leading position before the war, lost ground in the general election on October 21st last year and has a chance to rebuild its strength this time. The number of votes obtained by the extreme right wing will increase, and the number of votes obtained by the right-wing People's Republican Party will decrease. According to the results of a recent poll, the Communist Party is in the lead and can obtain 26% of the votes, and the Socialist Party is second with 23%. According to the results of a survey by the Survey and Statistics Office, the Communist and Socialist parties can obtain 25% of the votes. The People's Republican Movement Party can obtain 18%. The Communist and Socialist parties each occupy 140 or 150 seats in the 582-member House of Representatives. On the other hand, the right wing will have a great chance to rebuild its strength. The Radical Socialist Party can obtain 11% to 12% of the votes, compared to only 6% before. It can obtain about 70 seats in the House of Representatives afterward. The other right-wing parties, under the banner of the Republican Liberty Party, can obtain 15% to 20% of the votes and 80 to 100 seats in the House of Representatives.

### The United Nations Refugee Committee Recommends the Establishment of an International Organization to Save European and Asian Refugees; Many Opinions Are Mentioned in the Report

[United Press, London, 1st] The United Nations Refugee Committee today formally recommended the establishment of an international organization to help the three million homeless people in Europe and Asia. However, there are many disagreements in the committee's report, which may need to be fully discussed by the Economic and Social Council. The report begins by stating that latent political factors prevent this issue from being resolved unanimously. For example, whether refugees who disregard other countries for political reasons can receive international assistance is one point of disagreement. Fourteen members of the committee insisted that such people should be assisted, while the six Eastern countries led by the Soviet Union did not comment.

### The International Court Will Try Japanese War Criminals Today; It Will Summon Allied Dignitaries to Testify; The Names of the Witnesses Have Not Been Released

[United Press, Tokyo, 2nd] A reliable source told the United Press today: When former Prime Minister Tojo and other important war criminals are tried, famous officers in the US Army and Navy and prominent figures in the Allied diplomatic and political circles will be summoned to testify. Authorities here refused to release the names of these witnesses, but said that when the trial opens on June 3rd, the defense lawyers will take "bold" steps, and anyone the defense team deems necessary to testify will be summoned to testify. The authority continued to say that only President Truman and MacArthur were listed as the two people who "cannot be summoned to testify for the defendant." Before the prosecution makes a public statement or any evidence is received, the International Military Tribunal for the Far East will first deal with several motions submitted by both the prosecution and the defense.

[United Press, Washington, 2nd] It was announced today that Professor Blanc of Catholic University Law School has been hired as the international legal advisor to Prosecutor Keenan of the Tokyo International Tribunal.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] Since the Dutch professor Grotius first proposed the concept of international law to be observed by countries in 1628, Napoleon's exile on Saint Helena Island in 1815 was almost the first time a war criminal was punished. Although the Allied powers discussed the issue of German Emperor William II and more than 900 other war criminals in 1919, the concept of international trials of war criminals had not yet matured. Last November, the Nuremberg trial of Nazi war criminals was almost the first international trial in history. The Tokyo International Military Tribunal's trial, like Nuremberg, is the manifestation of mankind's highest wisdom seeking to prevent war from recurring.

### France Asks Britain and the U.S. to Intervene: Urges Siam to Return Territory, British Envoy Keen is Seeking a Compromise

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 1st Dispatch] Officials recently announced that, regarding Franco-Siamese relations, the French Foreign Ministry has approached the British and American ambassadors, alerting both governments. It is alleged that after border disputes arose between France and Siam, the Siamese government exaggerated the situation to divert attention, so that France's demand for Siam to return the territories seized from Vietnam in 1941 with the help of Japanese pressure would become a secondary issue. Therefore, the French government had no choice but to alert the British and American governments, thereby urging the Siamese government to cease its assistance and protection of Laotian rebels, and to return the territories seized from Laos and Cambodia to Vietnam. This is absolutely necessary.

[Reuters, London, 2nd Dispatch] The Observer reported on Thursday that Sir Josiah Crosby, the British Special Commissioner for Southeast Asia, is informally seeking a compromise to the Siamese-Vietnamese border dispute. The disputed territory is part of Laos and Cambodia that Siam seized from France in 1941. The Siamese people have deep feelings for these territories, so they might as well be called the Alsace-Lorraine of Siam.

Disputed Territory Originally Belonged to Siam

In 1867, the Kingdom of Cambodia became a French protectorate, but the northern provinces of Battambang and Siem Reap remained within Siam. Subsequently, France exerted pressure, and in 1904, the province of Lan Chang was ceded to France. In 1907, Battambang and Siem Reap were also incorporated into French territory. These two provinces have fertile land, forming rice-producing plains, and Siem Reap also contains Siam's precious historical sites. In 1940, the Siamese military dictator, Phibul Songkhram, demanded that the Vichy government return these two provinces and other large tracts of land, leading to war. The following year, with Japanese mediation, Siam took Laos's Lan Chang province (150 miles long and 60 miles wide) and Cambodia's Battambang, Bassac provinces, and part of Siem Reap (approximately 200 miles long and 75 miles wide).

### UN Human Rights Commission Resolves: To Establish a World Press Freedom Subcommittee, Chinese Delegate Xia Jinlin Submits Memorandum

[Associated Press, New York, 1st Dispatch] The United Nations Human Rights Commission has unanimously resolved to establish a World Press Freedom Subcommittee to study implementation methods. This case has now been requested for approval by the Economic and Social Council. This case is based on a memorandum from the U.S. State Department. Human Rights Commission Chairman Eleanor Roosevelt said it has been decided to invite experts to assist. Chinese delegate Xia Jinlin also submitted a memorandum, advocating that a subcommittee should be formed by representatives from countries with different levels of development in the world's press to conduct research. Xia also said: Americans naturally only understand the world from the American perspective, but they do not know that the press in other parts of the world is not so developed. American newspapers have become an industry, with huge profits, while other countries are not. News agencies such as the Associated Press and United Press cannot be competed with by other countries. These two news agencies can rely on income to maintain themselves and do not need government subsidies. In China, newspapers are poor, and news agencies cannot survive by relying on them. This situation is not unique to China. Therefore, we must invite representatives from other countries to participate in the subcommittee so that we can draft realistic and feasible plans.

### Today is the June 3rd Opium Suppression Day: Opium Burned as Usual, Police Bureau Strictly Prohibits All Opium and Drug Use in the City by the End of the Month, Sales and Trafficking are Punishable by Death

Today is the June 3rd Opium Suppression Day. At 9:00 AM, the Municipal Government's Memorial Week and the June 3rd Opium Suppression Day Memorial Meeting will be held simultaneously. Mayor Wu Guozhen will personally attend to report on matters related to opium suppression and to express his determination to eradicate opium and drugs in the city. At 11:00 AM, the Police Bureau will publicly burn opium paraphernalia and drugs on the Bund to raise public awareness. The Police Bureau has also set the end of June this year as the deadline for eradicating opium and drugs in the city. Any opium addicts who have not quit by the end of June will be severely punished upon discovery. "Sales," "trafficking," and "manufacturing" will be punishable by death.

The central government has long been determined to eliminate opium and drugs, and has repeatedly promulgated laws and regulations, clearly ordering its implementation. Shanghai, due to its past concession environment, had special circumstances, and the prohibition of opium was not thorough. Moreover, the enemy and puppets occupied the city for eight years and implemented policies of drug poisoning, so that Shanghai has almost become a haven for opium and drugs, which is deeply regrettable. After the Shanghai Police Bureau took over in September of last year, it immediately focused on this work. Director Xuan (Zhonghua) stated that opium suppression is crucial to the rise and fall of the nation, and he has paid special attention to it. He has formulated various plans and regulations for the city based on central government laws and regulations, and submitted them to the municipal government for approval and implementation. On the one hand, in accordance with the regulations, the period up to the end of March 1946 was designated as the period for opium addicts to register for reform, and all were to quit by the end of June. During the registration period, self-reform was promoted and encouraged through various means, and the registration books of opium addicts during the enemy and puppet period were collected. Each branch bureau was secretly ordered to earnestly implement the regulations.

More Than 500 Opium Offenders Detained

As of the end of March, a total of 6,060 opium addicts were registered, and 249 taels and 7 mace of opium, plus one package, four blocks, 5 catties and 12 taels and 4.5 mace of heroin, plus 244 packages, four blocks of opium paste, plus two and a half boxes, plus one tael and four mace, 745 opium bubbles, eight and a half cans of opium ash, plus five packages, plus half a box, plus ten taels and nine mace and six fen, seven packages of opium dregs, 397 opium pipes, 406 opium lamps, and miscellaneous opium paraphernalia, such as opium boxes, copper spoons, cleaners, etc., totaling 1,208 pieces were confiscated. Except for the opium, which was approved to be used for pharmaceutical purposes, and the pure heroin, which was handled separately, all the rest will be burned publicly in the Bund Park today on the June 3rd Opium Suppression Day, in order to raise public awareness. Since April 1, people who have been found transporting opium and drugs have either been sent for resettlement or to the court for trial. As of now, a total of 191 suspected offenders have been sent for resettlement, and 351 opium offenders have been sent to the court for trial (this number is up to the end of April. The statistics for May have not yet been fully reported by the various branch bureaus). The head of household's joint guarantee has been handled by the Civil Affairs Bureau issuing orders to the various district offices. They were originally limited to submit them to the various branch bureaus for submission to the archives for verification by April 15, but due to the busy election affairs, they have not yet been submitted in full. As for the opium and drug resettlement center, it has been established in accordance with the regulations within the Police Hospital, and a drug rehabilitation hospital has also been established, which has also been designated by the municipal government to be managed by the Shanghai Municipal Drug Rehabilitation Hospital. However, due to the limited number of hospital beds, the capacity is not large, which is not without difficulties.

Drug Rehabilitation Pills to be Sold This Month

Since receiving the Measures for Eradicating Opium and Drugs, the Health Bureau has organized an Opium and Drug Eradication Assistance Committee to promote the work. On the one hand, it ordered all public and private medical institutions to participate in assisting with drug rehabilitation. In addition, the testing work of the Shanghai Police Bureau's Opium and Drug Resettlement Center has recently been handled by the bureau, and the Municipal Drug Rehabilitation Hospital is specially responsible for receiving and rehabilitating opium offenders. Now, it has been ordered to jointly consult with the Civil Affairs Bureau and the Police Bureau to formulate an implementation plan and schedule for eradicating opium and drugs, so that it can be implemented on schedule. The Municipal Drug Rehabilitation Hospital will also be expanded into a Municipal Drug Rehabilitation Demonstration Center, with 300 beds, to accommodate and rehabilitate opium addicts. Regarding the drugs needed to quit opium, they have now been manufactured in accordance with the Shanghai Municipal Government's approved Measures for Opium Addicts to Purchase Drug Rehabilitation Pills Voluntarily, and they have been handed over to the bureau's drug supply department's various supply points to be sold starting this month. The measures are recorded as follows:

### Measures for Opium Addicts to Purchase Drug Rehabilitation Pills Voluntarily

(1) These measures are formulated in accordance with Articles 9 and 10 of the Executive Yuan's Measures for Eradicating Opium and Drugs in the Regions. (2) The drug rehabilitation pills shall be prepared and supplied by the Municipal Health Bureau in accordance with the prescription set by the National Health Administration. (3) All opium addicts in the city who voluntarily quit opium shall, after registering with the Police Bureau, purchase a registration certificate from the Municipal Health Bureau's Drug Supply Department with the registration certificate, and the registration certificate shall be stamped by the Municipal Health Bureau's Drug Supply Department. (4) The drug rehabilitation pills are divided into eight numbers. Opium addicts who quit opium on their own should judge the depth of their opium addiction and purchase and take them according to the number. (5) Opium addicts who purchase drug rehabilitation pills, if they still do not quit after taking them according to the method of taking them, may purchase them again once with the registration certificate and the drug dispensing slip from the previous purchase. (6) Poor opium addicts may, after being certified by the chief of the baojia and the Police Bureau, hold the certificate and request to purchase drug rehabilitation pills from the Municipal Health Bureau's Drug Supply Department, and may be given a reduction or exemption from fees at the discretion of the sales agency, which must register in detail. (7) Drug rehabilitation pills shall not be imitated or resold. Those who violate this shall be punished according to law. (8) These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.

### Opium Den Cracked on Eve of Opium Suppression Day

[Report from this newspaper] At around 9:00 PM last night, the Changning Police Bureau, led by Director Su (surname) of the Sub-Bureau, together with Section Chief Liu (surname) and other police officers, cracked three opium dens at No. 15, No. 19, and No. 58 Zhuananbang Road West, Yidingpan Road. More than ten smokers were arrested on the spot, together with opium and opium paraphernalia, and taken to the bureau. After a preliminary trial, it was confirmed and they were sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for further investigation this morning.

### City's Prices Higher Than Overseas: Many Foreign Ships Return Empty, Six Warehouses Increase Storage Fees Repeatedly

[Report from this newspaper] Since the victory, European and American shipping companies have resumed operations one after another, and a large number of ships have come one after another. Due to the lack of equipment at the city's wharves, it is not easy to unload goods, and they often have to be moored for several weeks, incurring huge expenses and losses. Especially since the city's prices are higher than those of other countries, exports have decreased as a result, and most foreign ships have returned empty. The Chinese customs strictly prohibits the import of luxury goods, so the cargo transport of foreign ships is also affected. Last Saturday, Jardine Matheson & Co. telegraphed the Philippines, instructing that if the two ships coming to Shanghai had luxury goods, they should not be transported to Shanghai, but should be unloaded in the Philippines or Hong Kong, so as to avoid being unable to be imported upon arrival in Shanghai. In addition, the repeated increase in storage fees in the city has caused great distress to merchants. According to the joint notice of six warehouses, including Butterfield & Swire, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Blue Funnel Line, Lung Mow, Kung Ho Hsiang, and Shanghai Wharf Company: Starting from June 1, the storage fees will be increased by 100%, and then by another 50%. This clever method actually calculates to an increase of 200%. For example, the storage fee for cotton is 260 yuan per foot per month (each piece is about 12 feet), cement is 260 yuan per bag per month, and each barrel is 631 yuan. With such high storage fees, merchants cannot afford it, and the transportation of ships is also indirectly affected to a considerable extent.

Key to Unfavorable Export Sales

Regarding the fact that the cheap sale of foreign goods makes it difficult to expand exports, the reporter interviewed an authority in the export industry and inquired about the matter. According to reports, there are many reasons for the unfavorable export factors, and it cannot be solved by simply lengthening the exchange rate. However, the elasticity of the exchange rate is related to the entire national finance and national economy, and there is also international restraint, so it cannot be decided rashly. The current regulations of the Central Bank, "Measures for Lending Foreign Currency," are actually sound policies, and in the future, there will be rewards for export professionals, which can establish a prosperous foundation from then on. In short, the implementation of this measure will reduce interest, which is an element of cost. Other points, such as the increase in transportation tools and the strengthening of management, are also the common requirements of exporters. Too slow transportation cannot save time, which is related to cost. Furthermore, modern countries all encourage export professionals in order to earn foreign exchange. All countries generally exempt export tax revenue. Although the export tax that our country has strictly set is small, it would be more beneficial if we could take the same steps as other countries.

### Suppression of Opium and Hygiene

— Yu Songyun

(I) Suppression of Opium and National Health. Today is the first Opium Suppression Day in Shanghai after its restoration, and it is of particularly great significance. In the past eight years, during the period of occupation, the cruelty of the enemy's implementation of the poisoning policy was truly frightening. Just look at the large number of people who are now smoking opium and using drugs, and the depth of the poisoning, and you can imagine it. May I ask why the enemy wanted to implement a poisoning policy against us? The reason is simple: they wanted to destroy our social economy, and more importantly, to ruin the health of our nation and shorten our lives. In those years, Mr. Lin Zexu said: If the opium poison is not eliminated, then in a few decades, not only will there be no money to be raised, but also no soldiers to be trained. These were words of foresight. The enemy used such a poisonous scheme to destroy us.

Now that the war has been won, we demand the permanent survival of the nation, and naturally we demand the health of the national physique. To demand the health of the national physique, opium and drugs must be banned as soon as possible. Therefore, opium suppression is the central task of the national health movement. There are certainly many methods for the national health movement, but none is more important than opium suppression work. Because the purpose of opium suppression work is to eliminate the things that threaten people's health, hoping that every opium addict can "escape from the sea of suffering" and embark on the road to health and happiness again. This kind of work can be said to be positive work, and it is work that is extremely in line with the principles of health care.

(II) Shanghai's Opium Suppression Work. Opium suppression work is divided into several types: prohibiting cultivation, prohibiting transportation, prohibiting manufacture, prohibiting sale, and prohibiting smoking. The competent authority in this city is the Police Bureau. The Health Bureau, from a health standpoint, assists in the two matters of investigation and detoxification. Regarding the investigation aspect, the Police Bureau has established an Opium and Drug Investigation Center in the Police Hospital, specifically responsible for the investigation of suspected opium smokers and drug users. Because the investigation equipment in the center is lacking, it is stipulated by the municipal government that all urine tests of opium addicts and drug users shall be handled by the Health Bureau. Regarding detoxification, there is currently one municipal detoxification hospital in this city, located on Hengbang Road in Zhabei. From its establishment on December 1, 1945, to April 30, 1946, a total of 264 people have been admitted to the hospital for detoxification, and 211 people have been successfully detoxified. Of these 264 people, 184 were male and 80 were female. The most common type of drug addiction was opium, with a total of 195 people. Heroin was the second most common, with a total of 60 people. There were four morphine injectors and five heroin injectors. In terms of age, the most common age group was 36 to 40 years old, followed by 41 to 45 years old. In terms of the number of years of drug use, the most common was 1 to 10 years, followed by 11 to 20 years. The most common reason for drug use was addiction through playing around, followed by drug use due to stomach problems, and then drug use due to pulmonary tuberculosis. In terms of the occupation of those undergoing detoxification, there were 187 merchants, 19 workers, 47 people who were unemployed at home, 3 people each from the education and agricultural sectors, and 1 person each from the journalism, political, and medical sectors. There are many opium addicts and drug users in Shanghai, and the number of people admitted to the detoxification hospital is only a very small fraction. Those who come here are all voluntarily seeking detoxification and are generally in better circumstances. There are many poor opium addicts and drug users who mostly smoke white powder or inject morphine. The Health Bureau has historically collected and buried exposed corpses, and many of them were morphine injectors and white powder smokers. There are also two things about the detoxification hospital that are worth telling everyone: The first is the mental training of opium addicts and drug users. In addition to fulfilling their responsibilities in technical aspects and helping patients achieve the goal of detoxification, general medical staff also provide various mental guidance to increase the determination of those undergoing detoxification and to make them feel happy and reduce mental depression. The second is that poor opium addicts and drug users can apply for the convenience of enjoying free hospitalization.

(III) My Few Hopes. Today, I would like to take the opportunity of the Opium Suppression Commemoration to offer a few words: (A) Article 2 of the "Measures for Eliminating Opium and Drugs in Recovered Areas" promulgated by the Executive Yuan in December 1945 stipulates: "The total time limit for detoxification in each province and city shall not exceed six months at the latest." The deadline for detoxification in this city is approaching. I hope that those who have not undergone detoxification will quickly undergo detoxification and not delay themselves. (B) Article 6 of the "Provisional Regulations on Punishing Opium Suppression and Drug Prohibition" stipulates: "Those who inject morphine or use drugs shall be sentenced to death. Those who smoke opium shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than one year and not more than five years. Those who are addicted shall also be ordered to be detoxified within a limited time. Those who relapse after detoxification shall be sentenced to death or life imprisonment." This is to tell everyone that smoking opium or other drugs will be subject to criminal punishment, and the punishment for relapse is terrible. Please seize the opportunity and quit as soon as possible. (C) We absolutely prohibit all kinds of inferior detoxification drugs that use exaggerated methods and make false propaganda. I hope that everyone will not be deceived and will report them at any time to help crack down on them. (D) Whether people become addicted through playing around or through illness, it is not difficult to transform a weak physique into a strong physique after detoxification, and it is absolutely possible, as long as everyone pays attention to implementing the following five things: First, have moderate exercise every day. Second, take a bath often. Third, eat at regular times and pay attention to the combination of nutrition. Fourth, go to bed early and get up early. Fifth, have a bowel movement once a day. If these few things can be done conscientiously, then physical and mental health will definitely improve greatly.

In short, smoking drugs is a shameful and terrible thing. Its harm not only harms oneself, but also harms one's children and grandchildren. It goes without saying that those who smoke drugs are physically weak, and their children and grandchildren will also develop serious physical weakness. Therefore, I hope that those who smoke drugs will stand firm, grit their teeth, and quit as soon as possible, in order to survive for themselves and also to win a breath for their children and grandchildren!

### Thorough Solution to the City's Housing Shortage Expected to Be Realized After the Production Conference

The city's housing shortage is second only to the food shortage. Yesterday, this reporter visited Mayor Wu to inquire about strategies for dealing with the housing shortage. He said: Regarding the housing shortage, I also attach great importance to it. Chairman Chiang personally drafted in Nanjing the principle of limiting occupancy to two rooms for five or more people, and three rooms for six or more people, with a maximum of no more than four rooms, to alleviate the housing situation. I strongly agree with this principle. Hereafter, the allocation of houses by administrative Yuan agencies should follow this principle. As for thoroughly alleviating the housing shortage, it will be necessary to wait until after the production conference before it can be addressed. Before a thorough solution is realized, if anyone occupies empty houses and demands advance fees in gold bars, citizens can report them to the Social Bureau and the Municipal Government's Housing Rental Committee, and they will be severely punished and absolutely not tolerated.

### Inaugural Meeting of the Housing Cooperative Held

The Office of the Special Commissioner for Cooperative Enterprises of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei of the Ministry of Social Affairs, in order to solve the housing shortage for public works employees in this city, advocated and initiated the organization of a housing cooperative. After active preparation, everything is ready. On May 31st, the inaugural meeting of the Shanghai First Housing Cooperative was held at No. 65 Daming Road. The articles of association were approved, and directors and supervisors were elected. All corporate members joining the cooperative will pay a share capital of 100,000 yuan, and individual members will pay a share capital of 10,000 yuan. From now until the 15th, it will be the period for collecting share capital. The cooperative's housing will be divided into two types: enemy property allocated and sold by the government, and American mobile homes. Members can choose either one and the housing will be allocated in order of joining the cooperative. After the housing is decided, members will pay 30% of the housing value first, and the remaining amount will be paid in installments. The cooperative's address is currently temporarily located at No. 65 Daming Road. If any agencies, organizations, or individuals in this city intend to join the cooperative in order to solve the housing shortage, they can directly write to the cooperative to request the articles of association and join.

This reporter specifically visited the person in charge of the Huangpu Precinct. The police precinct's reply telegram was also ambiguous.

### American Sailors Joking: Not Only Approaching Insult, but Also Endangering Lives

At 3:00 PM yesterday, a ferry carrying twenty or thirty passengers, sailing from the Pudong Xidu area to the opposite bank, was passing by the American warship No. 585 near Yangshupu. Suddenly, passengers were hit by the warship's sailors using water hose spouts, seemingly as a joke, but they ignored the danger of the small wooden boat capsizing in the rough waves. Everyone on the boat was soaked and filled with anger. Fortunately, several policemen on the boat maintained order and said that they would report it to the American military police, and only then did it subside. According to the boatmen, similar incidents often occur in the Huangpu River. They deeply hope that those responsible for the American warship will strictly restrain their personnel.

### Rigorous Investigation of All Grain Loans: Jiangbei, Tongyi, Yangtze and Other Companies: Persons in Charge Summoned for Questioning

[Report from this newspaper] Since the central government dispatched a high-ranking official to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate the root cause of the recent surge in grain prices, all related parties have been cooperating in the investigation. Mayor Wu has also repeatedly stated his determination to suppress and stabilize grain prices in this city. Therefore, the progress of the investigation work has been swift and decisive in recent days. It is reported that those participating in the investigation work, in the case of the 16 rice shops that received grain loans, include the Military Statistics Bureau, the Jiangsu Commissioner's Office of Supervision, the Shanghai Audit Office of the Audit Department, the Ministry of Food, and the Gongxin Accounting Firm, which shows the general importance that the authorities attach to the grain loan issue. Those who dare to test the law will be punished severely. Currently, in addition to Wu Rongsheng of Santai Bank already being detained and Rong Yongming of Wuchang Rice Shop being detained again due to suspicion of price gouging, responsible persons of other companies that received grain loans, such as Jiangbei, Tongyi, and Yangtze, have also been summoned for questioning.

Regarding the grain loan case, it was rumored yesterday that Wang Jizhi of Jiangbei Company and Lu Linxun of Tongyi Company had been detained. According to this reporter's investigation, Wang Xunzhi is not a member of Jiangbei Company. The rumors that personnel from Jiangbei and Tongyi Companies have been detained are both inaccurate.

### Tragic Incident in Huaiyang, Henan - Police Officer Shoots and Kills Middle School Student - Police Chief Instigated Beforehand and Abetted the Escape Afterward

[Report from our Kaifeng Office] Tian Zi'an, a police officer of the Huaiyang County Police Bureau, shot and killed Yang Qisan, a student of Chengyuan Middle School, on the evening of May 2nd without any reason. The act was inhumane. Now, students from various schools in the county have jointly organized the Yang Qisan Tragedy Support Association and sent telegrams to schools, newspapers, cultural organizations, agencies, and legal entities throughout the country, stating: Chengyuan Middle School, a private school in Huaiyang, Henan, has 15 classes in senior and junior high school with over 1,000 students. Due to insufficient dormitory space at the school, students reside in rented private residences under the guidance of the school. Yang Qisan, a student in the second year of senior high school, from Shenqiu County, resided at No. 8, Kexin Houjie in this city. He usually abided by school rules and focused on his studies.

Jumping Over the Wall to Enter the Compound

Unexpectedly, at 10 PM on the evening of May 2nd, Tian Zi'an, a police officer of the Huaiyang County Police Bureau, led two policemen, each holding a gun, jumped over the wall to enter the compound and stormed into the room of the Kong family, claiming to be acting on the orders of the police chief to conduct a household registration check. They turned over boxes and chests, creating a chaotic scene. After searching for two hours without finding anything, they discovered a bicycle in the student's room and attempted to seize it under the cover of darkness. The student stood up to reason with them, reminding the police that they were supposed to respect teachers and protect the people, and should not have greedy intentions. The police officer and policemen became enraged, tied up the student, and brutally beat him, leaving him covered in injuries. His screams echoed throughout the neighborhood. After the beating, they continued to search the room.

Shot in the Waist

Due to severe injuries and thirst, the student crawled in the courtyard in search of cool water. The police officer and policemen, assuming he was going out to report them, shot him in the waist with a handgun. The landlord and village chief carried him to the hospital, where he died immediately. Upon hearing the news, the school authorities rushed to the scene and requested Police Chief Yang Shijie to arrest the perpetrators. Unexpectedly, the police chief had already released Police Officer Tian Zi'an overnight and sent two policemen to take the blame. The Huaiyang District Court, the Huaiyang County Government, and Division Commander Zhu of the 16th Division of the garrison army sent personnel to examine the body. It was confirmed that the student, Yang Qisan, had first suffered severe injuries with broken ribs, and then a bullet penetrated his waist, causing his intestines to spill out, resulting in his death. During the court's interrogation, the two accused policemen confessed that after killing Yang Qisan, they reported to the police chief together with the police officer. The police chief asked the police officer to retrieve his pistol and two household registration books and ordered to flee through the West Gate of the city.

Abetting the Escape of the Perpetrator

It is found that Police Chief Yang Shijie actually instigated the police officer to lead policemen to commit violence in the dark and shoot and kill a student for no reason. Afterward, he also released the perpetrator, Tian Zi'an, to escape, showing blatant disregard for the law! After the tragedy occurred, students in various schools in Huaicheng, fathers calling their sons, brothers searching for their younger brothers, students fled to their hometowns, creating social terror and panic. The police chief, who treated human life like grass and ruined education, is extremely vicious. The students mourn the tragic death of Yang Qisan and vow to provide support to uphold justice. In addition to awaiting legal resolutions, they earnestly request leaders, officials, newspapers, schools to jointly advocate for the following: (1) Detain Police Chief Yang Shijie and set a deadline for the arrest of the fugitive perpetrator, Tian Zi'an; (2) Severely punish Police Chief Yang Shijie for instigating his subordinates to commit violence and abetting the escape of the perpetrator; (3) Request all newspapers to unanimously support the cause; (4) Request all school students to work together with one heart and one mind to achieve the goals.

### Wuhan University - Uncertain Resumption of Classes - Reinstatement Funds Not Effectively Utilized - Many Original Professors Have Accepted Positions at Other Schools

[Report from our Hankou Office on the 2nd] The situation regarding the resumption of classes at Wuhan University is gradually deteriorating. The reason is that the reinstatement funds allocated by the Ministry of Education to the university cannot be effectively utilized. Each student is only issued 100,000 yuan for travel expenses, resulting in difficulties that cannot be overcome. A portion of the reinstatement funds is currently being privately stored in a bank by the university's Academic Dean Yang, which has aroused opposition from faculty and students. Furthermore, over 20 professors, including Zhu Guangqing, Chen Yuan, Yang Rencai, and Tao Xun, have lost hope in the future of Wuhan University's resumption and have mostly accepted positions at Peking University, Central University, Anhui University, and Sichuan University.

### A Record of the Elementary School Curriculum Standards Conference

— He Yicong

During these three days—May 27th to 29th—over thirty elementary education experts and special envoys from the Ministry of Education sat around the snow-white conference table, which symbolizes the nation’s constructive efforts, and worked hard on this national-attention-focusing Elementary School Curriculum Standards Conference. As an auditor, I was lucky enough to participate in this grand occasion and felt an unparalleled joy!

The venue was located north of the grassland of the Youth Corps branch on Shaanxi South Road in Shanghai, in such a beautiful environment. Sitting beside the window-facing seat, I could see the large mirror hanging inside, which fully reflected the outside world, the green shade swaying, making people think of the cool flavor in the depths of the building. Only this great work deserves such a beautiful, quiet, and solemn environment.

Regarding the conference, both Mr. Xia and Mr. Cai have already made records. Here, I will provide some free reporting outside of the records.

As mentioned earlier, the tranquility of the air in the venue was unmatched in any other conference. This truly lived up to its name as a conference of experts, unconsciously making one aware of the greatness of the future of Chinese education. The conference lasted for three and a half days, with two and a half days being held in groups. The most impressive figure in the venue was Director Gu Shusen, the chairman, with that humble, experienced, and seasoned air. All debates were resolved through his hands. On the morning of the second day of the conference, it was too early, and only he and I were in the venue. He smiled and said he was going to play ball. While I was watching him gallop on the court, I secretly praised him for being "vigorous in old age."

The discussions on the issues of each subject were very enthusiastic, such as Xu Renjian, Xue Tianhan, Shi Renfu, Liu Qimu, Wen Shuting, etc. In particular, Mr. Dong Renjian (Principal of Xinlu Normal School), with his bald head, spoke very forcefully. At the end, when the final summary discussion was held, he even started a couplet with Director Gu. The most gentle were Mr. Chen Heqin, Shen Baiying, and Chen Bocui, who were calm and collected and did not say a single excessive word. Unfortunately, there were some regrets. When everyone was discussing the most tense moment, an old gentleman began to snore loudly. Several gentlemen only knew how to smoke and refused to speak, which was somewhat suspect of occupying a position without doing anything. There were also interesting things. On the last day, Principal Dong even led his family music team to personally demonstrate the value of music, giving people a beautiful shot to wear. During the break, I asked Mr. Huang from the Ministry to write a ink bamboo painting. When he signed his name, he smiled and told me, "My name is Huang Ruozhou. A newspaper mistakenly wrote it as Huang Ruodan. The Shen Bao changed it to Wang Ruozhou. It's really a big joke."

In the few days of the conference, I felt that there were two major crises facing education. The first is the low level of education in the inland areas, and the second is the panic among teachers. The former was reported by Mr. Huang, who said that when he ran to that side, not to mention the content of the courses, even the names of the courses were scattered and disorganized. The latter is an even more practical phenomenon in Shanghai. If they can't fill their bellies, who would be happy to stick to this position? Both of these crises are very urgent, and there are certainly many aspects that need to be remedied, but I don't intend to bring them up here, because even if I bring them up, people can't do it, and it would be in vain.

Finally, I want to praise all of these gentlemen for having a spirit of humility and open-mindedness on various issues. The two opinions raised by the Weiyu Elementary School Textbook Research Association and Mr. Lin Eryi (see Shen Bao) were all discussed in detail by them. The fact cannot be denied. This conference is just such a conference, and the achievements in just a few days are very limited. The effectiveness of the resolutions still depends on the realization of many conditions. However, the current need for educational progress is so urgent, and people's hopes for the conference are so sincere. How will the Ministry of Education, which hosted this conference, accept the communication suggestions from educational people all over the country? How will it match various correct experiences and reasons? Collect the wisdom of teachers and benefit the public, so that our country's basic education can embark on the road of building a new homeland. May 30th

### The Difficulty of Popular Lung Disease Prescriptions Widely Circulated

Since the Shen Bao published the prescription for lung disease sent by Zhang Xixian, the director of the Fengxiang County Police Bureau in Shaanxi Province, on May 19, it has been very popular with readers. It is estimated that a considerable number of people have taken the prescription, and there have been more than 50 letters from various parties asking about and discussing it. The letters were selected and sent to Mr. Chen Cunren, the consultant of this column and a traditional Chinese medicine doctor, for further study. He has kindly answered each question and disclosed the answers as follows: (Editor)

(1) Chen Yanling and twelve others asked: Is this prescription too expensive? Can sick readers combine purchases?

[Answer from Doctor Chen Cunren]: This prescription is two qian per medicine, and the current price of medicine in Shanghai is more than 4,300 yuan per dose. It is impossible to combine purchases. Now, I will modify the names of the medicines: donkey-hide gelatin should be changed to donkey-hide gelatin beads, and Sichuan fritillary bulb should be changed to Zhebeimu fritillary bulb. The price of the medicine can be reduced to 2,600 yuan, but the effect is the same. If you want it to be cheaper, you can buy half a catty of each medicine from a "pharmacy" and distribute it into forty doses by yourself. The number of doses per combination is extremely cheap, but this is not possible for those who are not familiar with the situation in pharmacies.

(2) Wu Hao, Xiang Zhiqiang and eight others asked: Does this prescription have the effect of preventing lung disease?

[Answer from Doctor Chen Cunren]: This prescription has no preventive ability. Taking this prescription will only have the effect of providing nutrition for those with weak lungs who do not have tuberculosis.

(3) Doctor Chen Bomin and Wang Yeqin, Guo Liangang, Zhou Senzhi, Xu Zhiqian, and Chen Sisong asked: Are there any errors in the medicinal ingredients of this prescription, such as Angelica dahurica, Asparagus cochinchinensis, safflower, and donkey-hide gelatin? Is there any room for negotiation on the amount of medicine?

[Answer from Doctor Chen Cunren]: The taste of Angelica dahurica and Asparagus cochinchinensis is indeed the original prescription, and there are no errors. However, the use of Angelica dahurica does require consideration; there is also room for discussion on the amount of safflower. For the sake of rationality, I think there are several points that should be changed in this prescription: Angelica dahurica must be changed to steamed Stemona japonica to increase the bactericidal effect; the amount of safflower licorice should be lighter; the amount of Rehmannia glutinosa and Morus alba should be heavier; donkey-hide gelatin should be changed to donkey-hide gelatin beads. Three eggs are too many and too stuffy, digestion is quite a problem, long-term consumption is annoying, and eggs have no significant relationship in the combination, but in order to increase nutrition, it is possible to cook and eat them separately, one is also possible, two are enough. Now I will modify this prescription reasonably as follows:

Morus alba, Asparagus cochinchinensis, and Rehmannia glutinosa three qian each, cooked Rehmannia glutinosa, donkey-hide gelatin beads, apricot kernels, Zhebeimu fritillary bulb, white peony root, Anemarrhena asphodeloides, steamed Stemona japonica two qian each, safflower, licorice five fen each (eat two eggs separately every day)

Such a modification not only has a higher effect, but also reduces the price of medicine to more than 1,700 yuan per dose.

### An Article of Sincerity

— Shao Xunmei

I haven't written anything for the past few years, my brain is practically rusted, and the pen feels like it weighs thousands of pounds. I really lack the courage to even pick it up, and even if I did, I wouldn't have the strength to move it.

Writing should never be forced. Articles that are forced out are like apples that haven't grown enough or turned red, always carrying a touch of greenness and a hint of sourness.

But there are articles that are forced out. People think highly of you and want you to express some opinions, and you can't really remain silent. In such circumstances, I often say, say whatever you have to say; say a few more words if you have a lot to say, and a few less if you don't. But there's one condition: the words must be true. Anything that is genuine, whether it's a single word, a flower, or a piece of paper, has a kind of beauty, a kind of moving power.

Many literary critics have diligently researched the characteristics of great works throughout history. The result of their research is that the greatness of a work lies in nothing but sincerity: only sincerity can be eternal and universal.

The kind of article we demand is an article of sincerity.

Aldous Huxley once said in an essay called "The Vulgarity in Literature": "It is vulgar to express in writing emotions that you do not truly have, but feel you should have because all noble people have them."

Therefore, to cater to fashion and utter insincere words, or to deliberately criticize and curse others in order to conceal one's own weaknesses, only to expose the very sins one possesses: such behavior is indeed vulgar to the extreme.

In the recent publishing world, this phenomenon is almost universal, the reason of course is still speculation and expediency, which can also be said to be the worship of "exhibitionism" and "inferiority complex." Eight years of war against Japan, living in tension every day, psychological change is also a fact that is not easy to completely avoid.

Post-war society was originally going to go through a considerable period of chaos. Many examples remain from the countries of Europe and America after the First World War, so we can take it as read that we shouldn't be surprised if we see things or articles that don't please the eye. But the hearts of the general public have already become false and deceitful, and in order to save people's hearts, we should do our best to promote articles of sincerity.

A great European revolutionary once said: "A country that has gone through a great upheaval is like a dirty pond that has been stirred up, and all the dirty things at the bottom of the pond float to the surface." The only way to deal with it is to wait patiently, and one day it will be clean. But we must be vigilant at all times, and constantly tell people not to mistake the dirty things floating on the surface for outstanding talents.

### On Viewing Paintings

— Wen Tong

It is easy to come into contact with painting in our daily life, especially in Shanghai, where painting exhibitions can be seen almost all the time, so how should we view painting as an art?

Painting is a two-dimensional art. In other words, when we look at it, we only need to pay attention to the painting as a single image. Around us, there are many kinds of paintings, such as Chinese paintings, oil paintings, comics, advertising paintings... all are paintings. Are all these paintings looked at in the same way, or how should a certain kind of painting be viewed? We should solve these kinds of problems first.

Although there are many kinds of painting, we can divide them into two categories: one is pure painting, which is specifically for everyone to see; the other is practical painting, which is for publicity or advertising. Although the former may also be used for publicity, the artistic component is still the main condition; the latter is not completely without artistic elements, but the main goals are explanation, recording, and instruction.

Here, I only want to explain the way of viewing the former type of so-called pure painting, that is, the way of viewing Chinese paintings, Western paintings, and popular paintings (woodcuts, comics).

First, let's explain the way of viewing Chinese paintings: Chinese paintings can generally be divided into three categories: figure paintings, landscape paintings, and flower-and-bird paintings. The main materials used to create these paintings are brushes, rice paper or silk, ink pigments, and calligraphy, which occupies the most important position in Chinese paintings.

When we see a Chinese painting, the first thing to grasp is the composition, and we must pay attention to the position of the host and the guests. Jing Hao said: "Brushwork and composition are even more important on the spot." Li Cheng said: "First establish the position of the host and the guests, determine the shape of the near and far, and then insert the scenery and arrange the height and low."

Secondly, we need to pay attention to the brush and ink. Chinese painting pays attention to the use of brush and ink. The brush is the composition of lines, and the ink is the transmission of color. Its thickness, lightness, emphasis, and suppression should all meet the requirements. Wang Luhu said: "The use of brush and ink are mutually complementary." Gu Ningyuan said: "The people of the Yuan Dynasty used the brush with vitality, the intention with simplicity, there is profound meaning in it." He also said: "Vitality means no superficiality, hence what scholars call the scholar's brush; simplicity means no artificiality, hence what refined people call refined and profound meaning." Wang Shigu said: "The use of brush has thick and thin, strong and light, if it is uniform, it will be bare." As for the use of ink, Zhang Geng said: "Whether the ink is thick, light, dry, or wet, it should not have the slightest hint of secularity, this is the ultimate." Shen Zongqian said: "If the ink on silk is a uniform piece, it is dead ink; if the shades are distinct, it is living ink. Dead ink has no color, living ink has light, and it must be carefully distinguished." These words can be used to help understand the brush and ink of Chinese paintings.

The likeness of form in Chinese paintings does not occupy an important position, so Zhang Yanyuan said: "Ancient paintings, either abandoned their likeness of form and valued their bone structure, seeking their painting outside the likeness of form, which is difficult to explain to vulgar people."

The highest principle of Chinese painting is "spirit resonance and life movement," but this is an abstract concept. Instead of groping for it in an abstract concept, it is better for the viewer to experience it from its basic characteristics. The first characteristic is lightness and simplicity. Rao Ziran said: "The arrangement must be open at the top and bottom, and the four sides must be unobstructed, so that it can be full and rich. If it is filled to the brim, it will not be elegant." The second is tranquility, which is the realm of selflessness. Wang Shigu said: "When painting reaches the realm of wonder, it must have a sense of tranquility." He also said: "When painting reaches tranquility, it has reached the peak of perfection." The third is openness and ease, that is, "unintentional" or "impromptu," which must be sought in unlimited time. Zhang Geng said: "Spirit resonance can arise from ink, from brush, from intention, or from unintentionality, and that which arises from unintentionality is superior." The fourth is classical elegance. Shen Zongqian said: "If you want to open up a new realm outside the rules of the ancients, there are few who do not fall into the demonic path." If you can understand these four characteristics, it will not be difficult to view Chinese paintings.

The inscriptions and seals on Chinese paintings have an intertwined relationship with the entire picture, and viewers of Chinese paintings must also pay attention to them. As for the authenticity and quality of ancient paintings, that is a matter of connoisseurship, which is not the most important thing for viewers of Chinese paintings.

Next, we need to explain how to view Western paintings. The so-called Western paintings refer to oil paintings, watercolors, charcoal drawings, etc. They can generally be divided into three types: figures, landscapes, and still lifes. Compared with Chinese paintings, it seems that the methods, materials, and content are different, but in reality, the spirit is different. Chinese painting is transcendent, while Western painting is realistic. Chinese painting is based on the theories of Gu Kaizhi and Xie He, and "spirit resonance and life movement" is its life, which is the expression of the writer's inner spirit and emotions.

Starting from this theory, the attitude of depicting Chinese paintings is generally said to be freehand, while Western paintings are realistic. However, broadly speaking, Chinese painting is not necessarily unrealistic. It is only a kind of subjective realism that develops from psychological expression to objective depiction.

Western painting is realistic, objective, scientific, and empirical. On the canvas, the most important condition is the concept of space. In other words, on a two-dimensional surface, the objects must appear exactly like they are reflected on a photographic negative, with distance, height, size, and things on many different planes are depicted on the same plane.

If we compare it with the composition of Chinese paintings, it is completely different. Chinese paintings often allow a lot of blank space, as long as it can have an organic connection with the image being depicted. Therefore, in Chinese paintings, it is often enough to depict a flower or a stone to make a painting, but this is absolutely impossible in Western paintings, because what Western paintings require is the reproduction of realistic images, that is, a visual art that attempts to construct an accurate concept of space from reason.

The way of viewing Western paintings should pay attention to light, space, form, color, brushwork, composition, and conception. A good Western painting does not necessarily have to be meticulously depicted or have a lifelike story. The emerging Western paintings of the 20th century have indeed completely broken through traditional techniques, and it can be said that they are similar to the method of viewing Chinese paintings.

Finally, we should put forward the way of viewing popular paintings.

The so-called popular painting refers to comics and woodcuts that depict the masses, approach the masses, and instruct the masses. The content of comics and woodcuts is often full of rich propaganda, so when viewing them, people often only pay attention to the content and ignore the form, which is not desirable.

The conditions for an excellent comic or woodcut are that the content is realistic, and the means to express this realistic content is the basic technique of painting - realism. If there is no basis in realism and you only play some clever tricks, this kind of work cannot stand.

If you grasp this basic point of view, no matter how deformed or exaggerated the comic is, the inferior technique cannot be concealed. Regarding woodcuts, there can be fine and dense or coarse and large distinctions in the knife technique, and the quality of the work does not depend on the fineness or coarseness, but on whether the basic painting techniques can be fully realized. As for the content of comics and woodcuts at this stage, of course, the premise for determining their quality should be whether they can express the spirit of democracy.

### The Dust of the Road

—

Turning a tired body, trekking from one city to another county, what is gained from the toil of the whole day, the fatigue of the journey? Apart from a face full of dust.

Nothing, not even vivid memories, vibrant colors, have been washed away in the torrent of time. Everything in front of me is gray, gray pedestrians, gray fields, gray universe!

How strong is the wind and sand in the fields? I remember the first day I left home, I was shocked by the wind and sand in front of me. I tried my best to block it, to fight it, but in the end, I was dyed with the color of the dust of the road.

In that faint gray-yellow color, a large period of time has passed.

Why do people have to walk endlessly on the gray-yellow journey?

On the journey, the traveler so rarely sees the original colors, the vibrant red, like the sunset dyed in the sky, the brilliant green, like the wild plants in the fields. Watching the sun sink from east to west, thinking of groups of people galloping in the fields, and new plants growing in the wind and sand, my heart is comforted.

Not only that, the plants grow luxuriantly under the hands of the travelers, and the footprints of the travelers increase on the long road. At that time, the fields become a lush green, and the songs of the travelers echo through the trees.

The traveler thinks quietly, temporarily staying in an old almshouse. Night folds into the house from under the old walls, and the heavy bell sounds like the breathing of a demon, thus interrupting his thoughts. So he gets up, tidies up his luggage, and breathes out, "Why is the wind and sand outside still so strong!" - I hope tomorrow will be a clear day!

### Expectation

— Hong Ye

Pulling up the tattered curtains, facing the twinkling stars, the small night has a blue lyricism.

Someone is playing the piano lightly on a small building, the sad and quiet sound stirs up a trace of remembrance in the traveler, and my eyes wander far away.

Far, far away, that distant place beyond the sea and sky, is it the hometown that contains my endless laughter and sighs? I miss those forests, snow-capped mountains, dreamlike past events by the evergreen river, and the shepherdess on the grassland...

How many years has it been? Are they still the same as they were then?

I watched my friends return to the south; watched them covered in wind and dust, with a body full of hardship, coming from the banks of the Songhua River; from the edge of the ancient Great Wall, and returning to the city where they had whiled away countless years of my illness, telling me some of the forgotten historical deeds. And I will hold their hands and ask them earnestly: is the scenery outside the ancient village still so charming? Are the forests and snow-capped mountains still the same as before? And, and has the shepherdess by the evergreen river become more haggard?

So, I close my eyes, listening carefully to the vicissitudes of the sea of people, the changes of things, the only thing that remains unchanged is the dream woven by my remembrance and homesickness.

Waiting; waiting; waiting for me to finish my spring, I will return. Putting on my old windbreaker that I wore when I left, picking up my luggage, carrying my poetry manuscripts, and saying goodbye to each of my friends and every familiar small city and street. So, whistling softly; crossing mountains and rivers, I will return.

Tonight, I have endless emotions to express. Write! Write! This endlessly beautiful poem...

February 13, 1946

### Thoughts

— Li Yang

When far away from the hometown, and walking from one foreign land to another unfamiliar land, the thoughts of the home far away in the horizon, the thoughts of the mother, will arise spontaneously. And constantly continue the tranquility of the mood.

The homeland does not have a sky full of beacon fires, but the wails of grief everywhere seem to be resonating everywhere, the hopes of many people have been destroyed, and the beautiful days of the past are no longer enjoyed.

The South has always been the place of people's dreams. But days that are too good are no longer something people can reach; only some - they exceed the scope of human morality and move towards the high mounds of supermen, their lives are always "beautiful," but they are also the most ugly. And too many people, their outstretched hands, are fragile, no, they are withered, their faces, their pupils, are no longer full, their eyes have no light of "spirit," they have even lost the instinct to walk.

The people in my home, I imagine that their faces must be pale, so pale that I dare not look directly at their reality. And the mothers? The mothers of all people, aren't they all living in fear?

Letters from some people, from distant mountains and barriers, across the sea and across the ocean, bringing some narratives, always seem to be very tragic, and the dark days make them too sad.

### Distance

— Shi Qingmei

Even people who fail geometry still know that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line, and besides that, all curves connecting these two points are longer than that straight line.

Once, we talked about the distance between people.

So, what is the distance between people? Is it status? Is it knowledge? Is it wealth, identity, or fame? Or is it the time and space that no one can control?...

But all of this is not it, all of this cannot affect the distance between people: a profound philosopher feels that a foolish man also has value worth thinking about, a colorful ball worth a thousand gold once hit the beggar who lived on food, sages and robbers will join hands, those who are destined will meet even if they are thousands of miles away, across the riverbank of time, we think of the people we liked or admired who lived thousands of years ago, and in contemplation, we might as well give them a knowing smile.

The distance between people is also just like the points and lines in geometry, and that line is drawn with "understanding." When understanding becomes a curve, the distance is as close as the horizon; when it becomes a straight line, even if it is far away, it seems to be close at hand. May 30, 1946

### Ghee

— Zhang Che

When I held with curiosity

The excitement of my heart

And the expectation on the corners of my lips

The trembling wrinkles

With thick red lips

The first time I touched the yellow

Molten gold-like liquid

That essence of the Asian prairie

The raw fragrance

How wonderful it was…

I smelled

The vigor of the wild

And the power of the primitive

And the fragrance of the valley, the fragrance of the earth, the fragrance of livestock, the fragrance of green grass, the fragrance of dew, the fragrance of moonlight, the fragrance of the nomadic girl…

I smelled

I smelled

Under the vast, rounded blue sky

The fiery red sunset

Shining upon the gilded splendor

Of the boundless green grass

That strong heifer

When the occasional breeze blows down

The long grass

Sparkling in the green

With hair covered in gold

It is grass of such fragrance

That feeds such a strong heifer

And that girl

(With a face tanned by the sun of the plateau

Whose black hair is combed by the wind of the plateau

Having the nimble deer-like

Strong arms and legs

The flame of youth

Burning red on her cheeks)

With bare feet bathed in the clear morning dew

Runs to the spring in the valley

Beside the spring blooming with bright red wildflowers

Washes off her face

Yesterday's sleep

And the darkness of the night

Of the fur in the tent

And the memory of the deceased

The sound of the flute at dusk

And then washes clean

Fingers smelling of milk…

Then

Carrying the drops of water that have not yet dried

Carrying the cool fragrance of the spring water

She grabs the udder of that heifer

From that ripe steamed bun-like

Full udder

Squeezes out the gushing milk

Fragrant milk filling all sides

It is with milk of such fragrance that ghee is made

When I held with curiosity

The excitement of my heart

And the expectation on the corners of my lips

The trembling wrinkles

With thick red lips the first time I touched the yellow

Molten gold-like liquid

That essence of the Asian prairie

The raw fragrance

How wonderful it was…

Do you embroidery pillows withering in the warm rooms in the city, do you ever smell

Such a fresh prairie animal fragrance?

April 28, 1942 in Yazhou, Xikang;

Rerecorded old work on June 1, 1946.

(Note) Ghee is made from cow's milk and is eaten by the Kangzang people on their main food "tsampa"; like butter on bread.

### A Shared Destiny (4)(3)

— Zhao Qing

Li Yun couldn't open the door, but she clearly knew Li Hua was inside, so she started crying too. This alarmed Madam Mo, who came over and called for Li Hua. Zhang Xian also followed. Hearing Madam Mo's voice, Li Hua had no choice but to open the door. Madam Mo, seeing that Li Hua's eyes were red, assumed the two young sisters had quarreled, and quickly took her hand, leading her outside. She said:

"Why are you arguing with your sister again for no reason?" Madam Mo half-jokingly, half-seriously questioned Li Hua.

Li Hua didn't say anything, and even shook off Madam Mo's hand, refusing to go out. Then, overcome with grief, she couldn't help but sob again. Li Yun, who had stopped crying, now saw Li Hua crying and mistakenly thought Li Hua was really angry with her, so she started crying again! The young sisters cried incessantly, leaving Madam Mo and Zhang Xian at a loss.

"These two children are still immature; they will need Master to discipline them more in the future," Madam Mo said with a smile.

These words further agitated Li Hua, and she involuntarily burst into loud cries, leaving Madam Mo flustered and quite annoyed, but she was embarrassed to show it with Zhang Xian present. So, she said to Li Hua in a displeased tone:

"What, what's wrong with you?"

Li Hua still didn't speak, but she didn't dare to cry loudly either.

"Alright! You just pull Li Hua away," Zhang Xian said to Madam Mo, "Leave Li Hua to me, I guarantee she won't cry anymore." Zhang Xian expressed confidently that he had a solution.

"Okay," Madam Mo said. "But this child has a bad temper; you must be understanding!" With that, Madam Mo took Li Yun and left.

Zhang Xian clapped his hands twice, shrugged, and walked towards Li Hua, constantly blinking his triangular eyes. This look made Li Hua feel disgusted, even scared. As he took a step closer, Li Hua took a step back, retreating to the bedside, where there was nowhere left to retreat. He gently raised his hand and picked up Li Hua. By this time, Li Hua had already stopped crying; she trembled all over as if she had been greatly frightened.

"Good girl! You really listen to Master and don't cry! Little darling, let Master kiss your little face!" With that, Zhang Xian brought his lips close to Li Hua's cheek.

"No! No!" Li Hua, terrified, tilted her head back and forcefully pushed against Zhang Xian's chin.

Zhang Xian's chin was grazed by Li Hua's small hand, and he was intoxicated by her beautiful, fair face. He couldn't help but forcibly kiss her head, her mouth, her eyes!

Li Hua was angered and humiliated, and she desperately swung her small fists, hitting Zhang Xian repeatedly, but this resistance couldn't stop Zhang Xian's barbarity. Only when he was satisfied did he automatically stop his rude behavior. Then, he pretended nothing had happened and smiled as he carried Li Hua into Shi Yu Lou's room, shouting as he walked:

"Madam Mo! I'm really amazing! She's stopped crying, but now she's hitting her master!"

Everyone looked and, sure enough, Li Hua was still hitting Zhang Xian. Madam Mo quickly scolded Li Hua.

"Xiao Hua, have you gone mad? How dare you hit your master?"

"It's alright! It's alright! A master should take a few hits first; otherwise, it's always the student getting hit, and that's not fair!" Zhang Xian said with a playful smile. He put Li Hua down, fearing that the child would tell the truth, and quickly said to Li Yun, "Xiao Yun, go and play with your sister; don't you dare cause trouble again!" Then, he winked at Madam Mo as if he were serious. "She won't cry, so don't keep fussing."

Li Hua stood there for a while, neither crying nor leaving, her face turning green with anger. Finally, gathering her greatest courage, she pointed at Zhang Xian, seemingly to Madam Mo and everyone in the room, and said:

"I, I won't learn opera from him anymore!"

Then, without looking back, Li Hua stubbornly walked quickly out and returned to her room.

"Well, Lao Zhang, she doesn't want you as her master anymore! How embarrassing!" Second Madam Weng teased.

And everyone laughed!

Zhang Xian was now both ashamed and remorseful! He was ashamed that the child had made him look foolish in front of so many people, and he regretted being so rash just now, giving the child a bad impression on the first day. If the child really refused to be taught by him, wouldn't this easy business be lost?

Madam Mo was somewhat surprised to see Li Hua acting so boldly today! Afraid of offending Zhang Xian because of this, she quickly apologized, saying:

"Master, please don't take it to heart. I told you, this child has a bad temper; she's been spoiled by her father since she was little, and she doesn't even listen to me at home. I thought she would be more sensible when she grew up, but who knew she would still be so stubborn! Please forgive her; I'll go and discipline her properly." With that, Madam Mo walked out angrily.

Zhang Xian quickly grabbed Madam Mo, because he had a guilty conscience; he was afraid that if this matter was exposed, it would be even worse! So, he said awkwardly:

"Let her go; children are like that. I'm so old; how can I be so petty with a child? You don't need to tease her anymore. She'll be fine in a while."

Everyone also helped Zhang Xian persuade Madam Mo. Everyone thought it was Li Hua's fault; that Li Hua had a perverse nature. Only Zhang Xian knew the truth, but he couldn't explain it for Li Hua.

Commercial News

### Under Strict Investigation by the Authorities, Rice Prices Fell Slightly Last Week; Black Market Prices for Financial Securities Also Declined Simultaneously

Rice and Grains: Under the continued strict crackdown by the authorities on rice speculation last week, people's minds were at ease, speculative activities subsided, and the market gradually returned to normal. In addition, there was a large influx of goods, resulting in sluggish retail sales. Although the overall drop for the week was slight, with Changxi White Rice falling by approximately 2,000-3,000 yuan and Xian Rice falling by approximately 3,000-5,000 yuan, there was no longer the wild price jumps of the past. If the authorities continue to strictly investigate and deal with rice speculators and manipulators, and if foreign rice can be imported as soon as possible, then the great turmoil may be transformed into a calm wind and gentle waves. After rice prices stopped rising rapidly, flour and miscellaneous grains also experienced a slight related decline. Only soybean oil cake fluctuated slightly, starting weak and sluggish at the beginning of the week, then suddenly turning lively and profitable after Thursday. However, according to investigations, the city's reserves are quite abundant, so problems are unlikely to occur. The vegetable oil allocation by vegetable oil factories was temporarily suspended due to the large reserves of oil in the market. Some say that the rise in oil prices is somewhat influenced by the suspension of allocations, as market speculators seek to profit and fear having no opportunity to do so, initially without considering the actual size of market reserves.

Gold Bars: The black market for gold bars opened at 1.85 million yuan at the beginning of last week and closed at 1.795 million yuan at the end of the week. During the week, on Monday, due to news of a large amount of gold arriving in Shanghai, there was a lot of selling pressure, and the price fell from 1.85 million to within the 1.8 million range. In the afternoon, it further dropped to 1.755 million yuan, the lowest price of the week. From Tuesday to Thursday, the market stabilized, hovering around 1.78 million. On Friday, due to strong demand from silver shops, it rapidly rose to 1.86 million yuan, the highest price of the week. The closing price on the weekend also fell by 47,500 yuan compared to the previous week.

Foreign Currency: The official exchange rate for US dollar telegraphic transfers remained unchanged. The trend of US dollar notes mirrored that of gold prices. On Monday, as gold prices fell, speculators rushed to sell, and the price dropped from 2,325 yuan to 2,260 yuan, the lowest price of the week. From Tuesday to Thursday, it was generally stable. On Friday, the gold market regained strength, and the price rose to 2,370 yuan, the highest price of the week.

Chinese Stocks: The market started firm at the beginning of the week but then weakened, with significant differences compared to the previous Saturday. On Tuesday, due to active short-selling, prices were generally low, with trends similar to yesterday. On Wednesday, with further pressure from short-sellers, the market declined in a roundabout way. Although there was some support towards the close, it was still lower than yesterday. On Thursday, yarn factories rose sharply, and smaller popular stocks were level with yesterday. On Friday, it was initially quite firm but then trended lower, especially at the close. As a result, Jingfu fell the most, almost on par with Xinguang. Other stocks rose and fell differently. On Saturday, trading was even quieter, with prices slightly lower than yesterday.

On Tuesday, selling pressure was widespread, and prices were again low. The British Union was the weakest. On Wednesday, the market was mixed. On Thursday, floating buyers absorbed, and all rose. On Friday, it was weak at first but then stabilized. As a result, except for Wheelock, all declined slightly. On Saturday, there was profit-taking at high prices, resulting in a decline.

Rayon: The spot price of 120-count Dayouguang rayon was 1.38 million yuan on Monday, down 80,000-90,000 yuan from the previous weekend. Afterwards, the market trend remained weak. Until Thursday, due to the China Textile Corporation opening prices 20,000-30,000 yuan higher than the previous time, people's sentiment turned positive, and it actually rose by 100,000 yuan that day. On Friday, outsiders sold at high prices, causing it to fall by 30,000-40,000 yuan. On the weekend, it softened again, returning to the original price on Monday. Other miscellaneous brands did not fluctuate much during the week.

Factory Yarn: Firm and stable. The selling price remained unchanged throughout the week. Foreign yarn, 83 points, opened at 2.5 million yuan, 81 points at 2.45 million yuan. 78 points opened at 2.3 million yuan at the beginning of the week, and then the price was 40,000-50,000 yuan higher.

Dacheng Grid was even more extreme, the price on Saturday was 350 yuan higher than on Monday. According to insiders, Dacheng Silk Factory, due to the burden of high wages, was selling prices below cost and will be forced to stop some of its work. Other silk factories are also not worried about [missing characters] and are helpless. All manufacturers are facing a crisis, and if they do not try to save the situation, there is a risk of collapse.

Spot Yarn: Initially, due to good demand from Tianjin and Guangdong, and the gradual rise in gold prices, the market price trended upwards. However, due to the end of the month and the lower gold prices, and because the holidays were approaching, many bulls holding spot goods began to sell, and the price trended downwards. But the result was still a slight increase overall. The highest price for the week was 2.59 million for 40 [missing character] and Blue Phoenix on Friday. The lowest was 860,000 for 10-count Delihui on Wanqi-1. In terms of count, coarse yarn was lively while fine yarn was flat. 10-count [missing characters] rose the most by 100,000. 16-count Guang [missing character] rose by 80,000. 42-count Blue Phoenix rose by 30,000. 40-count [missing character] City and 20-count Special Shuangma remained unchanged. Recently, the phenomenon of high fine yarn prices and low coarse yarn prices in the yarn market may gradually become balanced in the future.

Cloth Market: Demand from merchants and retailers was quite strong, and the market improved somewhat. Shilins such as Ji Meiting and Taohuagirl were 4,000-5,000 higher than the previous week. 12-pound heavy fine cloth and 6-pound Huadie coarse cloth each rose by 3,000-4,000. In addition, the price increases for other brands were slow, approximately 1,000-2,000.

Cotton Market: Factories and cotton merchants were still purchasing, and the market was not deserted. The market price was lively for coarse lint raw materials but flat for fine lint raw materials. On the weekend, the factory price for Pudong Huo Ji reached as high as 100,000 yuan, on par with US cotton Mittel.

### Zhu Xuefan Proposes Promoting Cooperative Factories to Settle Unemployed Workers Arriving in Shanghai and Resolve the Issue of Excessive Wages

[This Newspaper Report] Cooperative factories are a product of modern times and can help eliminate labor-management disputes, raise the status and responsibility of workers. After the victory, the Ministry of Social Affairs issued an order promoting them. The Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau also repeatedly consulted with the Enemy and Puppet Assets Disposal Bureau, requesting the allocation of one or two enemy and puppet factories for pilot projects, but no agreement has been reached. When unemployed workers from Chongqing recently petitioned for jobs in Shanghai, Zhu Xuefan, Chairman of the Federation of Labor Unions, suggested that it was difficult to place them all at once, and also proposed running cooperative factories to provide relief. According to Zhu, in addition to this, he also intends to use this cooperative spirit to solve the current problem of excessive wages. He said that he is currently drafting a plan to promote cooperative factories as a principle for labor-management cooperation during this economic and industrial crisis period. He believes that the development of the economic crisis not only makes it difficult for small factories to maintain operations, but also makes it impossible for general factories to bear labor costs due to the rising cost of living. The current wages exceed the price of raw materials, and the trend is very obvious. Therefore, Minister Gu pointed out that the industrial crisis is also a crisis for the workers themselves, and said that if factories are not operating well or have real difficulties and cannot pay wages according to the cost of living, labor and management can negotiate on their own or reduce wages through an arbitration method. However, he believes that the increase in the cost of living means that the labor remuneration obtained by workers has not actually changed, but only maintains a certain standard. This standard is a right that labor should have and should not be changed. He suggests establishing a labor-management cooperative system in factories, that is, the wages that the factory cannot bear should be voluntarily invested by the labor side to purchase the factory's shares. In this way, the factory's burden is reduced, the workers avoid losing the opportunity to work, and also obtain the corresponding profit. The worker becomes a part of the business, and should fulfill the corresponding obligations and rights. This economic cooperation between labor and management will be more thorough than spiritual cooperation. He also said that this system is the first of its kind in our country, and difficulties are inevitable. In addition to making suggestions to the government, he will also invite the press in the next few days to solicit public opinion and opinions from the business community. The worker's meeting convened by the Federation of Labor Unions today will also discuss it, and he also said that cooperative factories are also the best way to solve the problem of unemployed workers. He is currently consulting with the Ministry of Economic Affairs to allocate factories that have not yet started construction to accommodate unemployed workers from the rear and Shanghai, and to carry out pilot projects first, managed by the state, so that a huge amount of labor will no longer be wasted.

### Tianjin and Shanghai Have Similar Methods for Suppressing Grain Prices

The following two measures were decided: (1) Strictly crack down on horizontal transactions and prohibit hoarding and speculation. (2) Prohibit non-industry personnel from purchasing in large quantities. The amount of grain stored by all merchants should be reported on a regular basis. The Bureau will properly formulate measures to implement these two measures seriously.

### Shanghai Sold Over 40 Billion Yuan Worth of Enemy and Puppet Assets in May

The Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Enemy and Puppet Assets Disposal Bureau recently announced that in May, it entrusted the Jianghai Customs to auction enemy and puppet assets ten times and auction twice, with a total income of approximately 2.5 billion yuan. It also entrusted the Central Trust Bureau to auction eight times and auction twice, with a total income of approximately 5.5 billion yuan. In addition, it entrusted the China Textile Construction Company, the China Vegetable Oil Factory, the China Paper Industry Corporation, and other institutions to dispose of a large number of enemy and puppet assets, with cloth and rayon accounting for the largest number. Detailed statistics have not yet been received, but according to a spokesman for the Bureau, the value of assets sold in May in Shanghai alone was approximately 40 billion yuan, far more than in April.

### Measures Decided for Dealing with Illegal Sale of Assets

The Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Enemy and Puppet Assets Disposal Bureau passed measures yesterday for dealing with the illegal sale of enemy and puppet assets by receiving personnel. (1) If it is determined that the buyer and seller colluded, or the buyer knowingly purchased the assets, the assets will be confiscated. (2) If it is determined that both the buyer and seller were unaware and acted in good faith, they will be given a deadline to report to the Disposal Bureau for review. If verified to be true, they will be exempted from prosecution, but the seller will still be responsible for compensation. The Bureau has issued orders to its offices and branch offices in various locations to implement these measures.

Production and Construction Special

### Urgently Needed: Textile Spindle Tape Factory

— Zheng Jian

(1) Introduction: Since the Industrial Revolution, the textile industry has evolved from handicraft to machine industry. Inventions and improvements have achieved amazing results from time to time, resulting in more refined technology and more advanced production. Dr. Sun Yat-sen said that the most important thing in nation-building is the people's livelihood. The problem of people's livelihood includes clothing, food, housing, transportation, education, and entertainment, etc., which have long been deeply considered by the whole country.

Clothing belongs to the textile industry. At the beginning of nation-building today, the government has been working hard to rectify the textile industry and gradually restore production. However, it has not paid attention to small-scale textile industries, which is a pity. The spindle tape industry is a kind of textile industry and is also one of the materials used in textile factories, but its quality is of great importance to the output and benefits of the entire yarn spinning.

(2) History: In 1887, the famous textile machinery manufacturer Dobson Factory in the United Kingdom, a leading country in the European textile industry, first researched and improved the spindle tape, changing the original round spindle rope into a flat spindle tape. The experiment was successful, and it was well received by textile factories everywhere. The advantages are as follows: (1) The twist of the yarn is uniform; (2) Reduce mechanical devices, such as changing the original double roller to _ roller transmission; (3) Reduce horsepower and save expenses; (4) The running time of the spindle tape is longer than that of the round rope, which reduces breakage and empty spindles, and increases production. In 1908, 80% to 90% of the yarn spindles in textile factories in Europe and the United States used spindle tapes for transmission. Later, after the textile industry rose in our country, it also followed into our country's textile industry.

(3) Establishment Time of Domestic Spindle Tape: Our country established the first spindle tape factory in the third year of the Republic of China, _ during the European War, when the source of foreign goods was cut off. At this time, our _ cotton spinning industry was in a period of revival. Mr. Wu in the textile industry, in view of this, engaged in organization and stepped up the process. He successfully planned and established a factory on Qiwupu Road in Shanghai in the summer of the third year of the Republic of China. However, at first, the people of the country did not pay attention to this _. Mr. Wu and others suffered from a shortage of funds and simple equipment, with only 20 looms. Fortunately, after many years of hard work, the products were gradually improved and surpassed foreign goods, and then they were adopted by the national textile industry, and their reputation increased day by day. When the European War stopped, the major powers produced large quantities of textiles, which were transported and sold to our country. From then on, our country's cotton spinning industry declined again, and the spindle tape industry followed suit. Fortunately, Mr. Wu struggled with courage and sincerity. At that time, the factory increased the production of military textiles to increase income. The spindle tapes produced by the factory were marked with __, ___ and used ships as commercial strongholds. When the August 13th Shanghai battle broke out in the 26th year of the Republic, the factory was forced to stop.

In the spring of the 27th year of the Republic, Mr. Wu again worked hard to run around to find ways to move the important parts of the factory into the former French Concession to prepare for resuming production. Later, due to the urgent need for military cotton weaving by the government, he was instructed to move again. Finally, in the winter of the 27th year of the Republic, Mr. Wu led the entire staff and machines to Hong Kong and jointly established a cotton weaving factory with the local Baoan Industrial Company to expand the scope. The author was in charge of the engineering work in the factory at that time. After six months, all the original looms and the added looms, a total of more than 300, were carefully organized and arranged, and production continued.

At the beginning, because the Baoan Company mainly produced gas masks, all the cotton fabrics were woven by the cotton weaving department, such as mask bags, shoulder straps, and headband tubes. By 1939, Germany launched World War II, and many countries were involved in the war. In 1940, a part of the cotton weaving industry in the United Kingdom was converted into the military industry, and a part of the military cotton fabrics was entrusted to major factories in Hong Kong to undertake. The factory was also allocated a large number of weaving quantities and was engaged in production. Unexpectedly, at the end of the year, the Japanese launched the Pacific War, and the factory was destroyed by artillery fire. Mr. Wu's thirty years of painstaking management has been reduced to ashes. Now Mr. Wu is planning to restore this business in Chongqing, but he is suffering from weak economic strength and cannot fulfill his wish. He can only sigh at the ocean.

At the beginning of the founding of the country today, and in today's days when industry is waiting to be revived, and in the future national plan to implement a thousand spindles factory, the spindle tape industry should be reorganized, and only a few companies in Shanghai were engaged in this business a month ago. Most of the equipment is not complete and the production is small. In the future, we must expand in time, work hard to prepare, and provide applications to avoid foreign goods flooding the market and money overflowing. The author believes that it is appropriate to use part of the enemy and puppet textile factories for the application of this industry.

### Burying Ourselves in Construction

— Lin Han

For decades, our country has suffered from the aggression and exploitation of imperialists. The loss of land is of course extremely heartbreaking, but the invisible shackles and ruthless magic hands of imperialists have obtained our country's markets, plundered our country's resources, and sucked the people's fat through the privileges under unequal treaties, almost making our country sink invisibly into an irrecoverable and miserable situation; eight years of brutal war has destroyed all the little foundation that had survived under the economic aggression of imperialists. Our country after the victorious end of the war is just like an elderly person who has recovered from a serious illness, and urgently needs nourishment and recuperation. If _ _ is done properly, it may not be _ _ "rejuvenated"!

What is the _ of "rejuvenation"? In a nutshell, it is "burying ourselves in construction." Constructing politics, constructing science, constructing people's livelihood, and constructing national defense. Now is the time when everything has to be constructed! Regarding politics and national defense, we will not discuss them for the time being, but let's talk about "catching up" in science and "production and construction" in people's livelihood. As early as the 19th century, when the steam engine was invented and widely used, we should have stepped up to catch up with others in time. Now others have rapidly progressed to the era of developing the inexhaustible "atomic energy," and we are still walking slowly, looking _ and out of reach. Looking through the history of the development of science and industry in our country in recent decades, we have never had any performance that surpassed others or kept pace with them. How can such a country not be backward and decline? Now we are lucky enough to win the War of Resistance, and all so-called special rights—invisible tools of aggression by imperialists—have been abolished, sovereignty has been completed, and all obstacles to construction have been cleared. Moreover, the strong enemy of the domestic goods market before the war—Japan's _ _ is extremely _ _ _ _ ; these internal conditions and external environment can be said to be the most _ _ builders.

According to _, the Japanese after the defeat do 14 hours of work every day, burying themselves in hard work and plotting to revive! I remember Nelson, the Director of the US Production Bureau, said, "Unless a new country producing cheap goods emerges in the East to supply the foreign markets that Japan possessed before the war, Japan's industry will soon once again hold the bull's ear in the Far East, and Japan will once again become an imperialist aggressor." "If China can replace Japan as the leading industrial country in the East after the war, it will not only be fortunate for the United States, but also for the whole world." Can we deny this obvious view? Japan is struggling to turn over, and friendly countries are urging us, caring for us, and we should also be alert, self-motivated, and seize this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to bury ourselves in construction, and not let the revolution of decades, the hard battle of eight years, and the hard-won opportunity of a thousand years be wasted.

### Making Mobile Homes Affordable for the Common People – The United States Prepares for Mass Production

— Ying Dai

After the end of the war, in the whole world, in addition to the food shortage, the housing problem is also very serious. It goes without saying that countries that directly encountered the war, such as England, France, the Soviet Union, and Germany, had many cities where a lot of houses were damaged during the war. Even the United States, which was not bombed by the enemy, is also experiencing a housing shortage.

To solve the housing problem, given the current situation, it is of course necessary to build thousands of houses, but this is impossible in terms of time and manpower. How can it be completed in a short period of time? Even the raw materials have become a problem. Because during the war, all factories that manufactured building materials and furniture were concentrated on manufacturing military supplies. Therefore, Americans believe that the most rapid and effective solution to the housing shortage is to mass-produce mobile homes.

In order to meet this need, mass production of mobile homes in the United States in the short term is inevitable. Now, there are already many construction companies in the entire United States that are conducting or planning to build mobile homes. What they pay attention to is, on the one hand, mass production; on the other hand, seeking to make them affordable for the common people; at the same time, they also pay attention to publicity work, so that people in general can trust mobile homes.

In fact, American construction companies had already started building mobile homes before the war, but they were not noticed at that time. Today, after the war, mobile homes are now receiving attention and becoming popular because of the housing _ _. Especially during the war years, mobile homes made many contributions to the military, serving as guard posts, barracks, and _ head workers' dormitories for the US military. Therefore, all _ mobile homes produced at that time were used entirely for military purposes.

Now that the war is over, mobile homes must of course be transferred from military use to civilian use. From now on, the mobile homes manufactured by various companies will be sold publicly on the market, and the styles will also be different from those during the war, and will be more exquisite and beautiful. Moreover, _ _ is determined by how many people are in your family and what kind of house you need, and determining one or two floors, three or four rooms, or seven or eight rooms.

Given the current situation, throughout the United States, old companies are expanding their scope, and new companies are being established, and everyone is focusing on manufacturing mobile homes. Moreover, they pay attention to making them affordable for the common people, reducing costs as much as possible, and making the selling price as low as possible, with the simplest ones costing around US$2,000. This is already suitable for the economic power of an average worker in the United States. The intensity of the competition is obvious to everyone.

And we believe that the production of mobile homes will soon expand from the United States to all parts of the world. Because recently, many people from various countries have been sent to the United States to study mobile homes. _ England has already converted several aircraft factories to manufacture mobile homes. Therefore, it is not difficult for us to imagine that in a few years, this new business will surely expand to countries all over the world!

### Labor Unrest and Law Abiding

— Han Ju

Whether a country is well-governed and whether its politics are on the right track depends on whether the government can achieve the rule of law and whether the people have a spirit of law-abiding.

Unemployed workers from the rear who came to Shanghai petitioned the social organization to resume work the other day, resulting in a riot, smashing glass windows and public property, confiscating security guards' firearms, and holding the front and back doors, prohibiting personnel from entering and exiting. Fortunately, the authorities responded effectively, so no tragedy occurred. This is the most serious phenomenon since the beginning of the labor unrest in Shanghai. The day before, Mayor Wu and Minister Gu announced five measures to deal with labor unrest, only the first of which was to "severely punish those who incite labor unrest" and the fifth was to "laborers should absolutely abide by discipline." Only one day apart, in the workers' petition the day before yesterday, they even went so far as to show off coffins and stretchers first, and then sent out thugs to stage a full-scale fight with the Social Bureau first, assaulting the police, seizing guns, destroying property, and injuring people, which was no different from directly provoking Mayor Wu's labor policy.

We certainly do not discuss whether there are other backgrounds to this incident, but that their actions have obviously exceeded the scope of purely economic labor unrest is beyond _ narration. It is true that these unemployed workers made contributions to the War of Resistance and helped production in the rear, and should be given priority to resume work after arriving in Shanghai. This is the worker's _ reasonable request, and the government should first find a way to settle them down to comfort their loyalty, which can be said to be _ selfless. However, their adoption of this riotous method has not only lost the sympathy of the social community, but is also a perverse act that completely violates the law and obstructs the country from moving towards construction. We advocate severely punishing the masterminds who incited and committed violence.

They are all unemployed workers who came to Shanghai from the rear, and during the War of Resistance, they sweated and suffered _ to stay at their posts and assist the government, and never went on strike or were lazy, and never staged this full _ line. Although the War of Resistance has now been won, the country is still in the most difficult situation. If we want to build a brilliant and bright new China, we must take steps to speed up production. The workers in the rear should not forget their glorious history in the past, and should not disgrace the spirit of loyalty to the country in the past. They are all engineers of the new China, and should be honest and law-abiding. On the one hand, they should use reasonable methods to achieve the purpose of employment, and on the other hand, they must not be emotional, so as not to destroy the fragile foundation of the country.

### An Introduction to Mutual Consultation Management

— Xu Baiyi

Because he is willing to take responsibility, what he says becomes actionable, thus gaining the trust of his subordinates and enabling his decisions to be implemented.

In the business field, we often hear people say that someone "speaks with shoulders," which actually means taking responsibility. A person who is willing to take responsibility can gain the trust of both superiors and subordinates, and can also make outsiders trust his every move, thus creating opportunities for his success.

Three, the ability to observe: To solve various problems, you must first study where the center of the problem is. Therefore, the ability to observe is also quite important. When we encounter problems, if we do not analyze them, we will not be able to see where the problem lies. We must bring out the main center of a problem. Separating the center of the problem requires the ability to observe.

Four, collect information: The difference between a person who can make accurate decisions and a person who makes wrong judgments is often the difference between whether the information is collected sufficiently. When we are studying a problem and need to solve it, we must first collect as much information as possible about the problem as a basis for the solution, because without that information—facts—guessing out of thin air, the judgment made will not be accurate.

At the same time, we must also pay attention to whether the collected information is accurate. If the collected information is not accurate, then the judgment made cannot be accurate.

Five, concentrate your thoughts: To solve a problem, you must concentrate your thoughts when studying it and must not be casual. In management law, there is a principle that:

"A person who can do things well is a person who can concentrate his thoughts on the problem and eliminate all other distractions in the process of planning a solution to the problem."

Six, ideals: Ideals are also very important. When solving a problem, we must think about all aspects of the problem and all possible consequences. A person without the ability to idealize often only thinks about the surface of things and problems, and inevitably overlooks this and loses that.

The above points are all necessary conditions that must be cultivated in terms of cultivating a sound mind.

Foreword

Before talking about the various problems of the production organization, we can say something about the purpose of running industrial and commercial enterprises. In this regard, it can be said that the purpose of any enterprise is to obtain profits, although the acquisition of these profits can be divided into short-term and future types. Many enterprises can obtain considerable profits after they are established, but there are also some enterprises that must undergo a considerable period of hard work before they can obtain profits. There are also some people who run a business for their own reputation or status. Their purpose is not to obtain monetary benefits, but the increase in reputation and status can also be said to be a kind of benefit. Therefore, when talking about whether an enterprise is successful, it is often necessary to ask whether it can make investors have considerable profits.

### New Lotus Emerging from Water, Pleasure Boats Like Shuttles – A Nanjing Panorama

— Nanjing, 28th Day Correspondence, Zhi Nan

Nanjing seems to be undergoing a transformation, but many things and phenomena happening now indeed require a high degree of vigilance and even more so, clear handling. In the future, there will be more and more people. If some problems that affect citizens deeply are not resolved early, dealing with them in the future will be extremely difficult. Here, we would like to provide a concise sketch of the capital.

Xuanwu Lake's Scenery Approaching a Golden Age

Spring is late, and the weather is charmingly fine, not yet sweltering. Friends arriving by plane from Chongqing cannot help but be surprised upon their arrival, truly fitting the line of a poem: "If you arrive in Jiangnan to catch the spring, be sure to stay with the spring." The changes in Jiangnan's weather make it easy for people to adapt. On rainy days, looking out from a high-rise window, the Stone City in the misty rain has a unique charm. Walking on the streets on rainy days is unlike Chongqing, where mud splashes everywhere. As vehicles pass, pedestrians must "bow" to them, using umbrellas as shields. However, the alleys here become canals on rainy days, and one must wade through the water to pass.

The dance halls that were once bustling are now deserted. The Nanjing Central Daily was the first to propose a ban on dancing. After the ban was issued, dancers, musicians, managers, and others petitioned for the resumption of business, but the result was disappointing. Thus, dance halls turned into music tea houses. Some dancers transformed into singer-like socialites, some yearned for a lifelong partner, and some slipped away to Shanghai to continue their life of entertainment. Are the dancers willingly lonely? Listening to Qingchang at the Confucius Temple is another kind of stimulation. At the same time, the sounds of impromptu dances can also be heard from private parties from time to time. The only difference from before is that those former dancers mostly look pale and haggard.

The invisible footsteps of summer are gradually approaching. Within the city, water trucks have already been deployed, and fashionable ladies are wearing their sunglasses. Jeeps come and go like flying arrows, with news of injuries every day. Every holiday, Xuanwu Lake and Bailuzhou are crowded with tourists. New lotus flowers emerge from the water on the lake, and pleasure boats move like shuttles. The next two months will naturally be the golden period for Xuanwu Lake. Tea houses and restaurants by the lake also spring up in response. The seats are always full. The pleasure boats use white cloth as awnings, and inside are placed lounge chairs and small square tables, seating twelve, eight, or six people, depending on the boat. Because there are many tourists, the prices are also high. There is also a type of light boat that only accommodates two passengers, and the price is slightly lower.

Newspaper Humor Points Out Serious Housing Shortage

Recently, a certain newspaper in Nanjing used a humorous tone to say, "Housing matters are serious!" Using such an inelegant phrase to describe the current housing shortage makes people feel both amused and helpless! People returning to the capital are coming from the water and from the air, increasing day by day. As soon as they arrive in the capital, everyone feels a headache over the housing problem. Although Nanjing is large and there are many Western-style houses, they are irrelevant to them. Many people are forced to use small hotels as their temporary homes, and some are willing to endure coldness and neglect to live with relatives and friends. Even if they find a house, the deposit and rent are often shockingly high, making it unaffordable for those below the middle class. According to official announcements, the population of Nanjing before the war was about 1.3 million, but now it is only 700,000. Judging from these two figures, Nanjing should not have a so-called housing shortage phenomenon. The occurrence of the housing problem is still mainly due to man-made factors. Now, those who own property in Nanjing are getting rich, while the lower and middle-class public employees who rent houses are getting poorer.

The evening newspaper the day before yesterday published a news item: "Landlord forces tenant to move out, tenant in desperation jumps into the river." Yesterday's Central Daily published an article by its president, Ma Xingye, titled "Two Examples, One Appeal." The two examples are: "The first thing is that the landlord of a certain address in Tianjiying proposed to me that the monthly rent for the residence of one of our editors be increased from 40,000 yuan to 300,000 yuan, and the deposit from 100,000 yuan to 1 million yuan. The second thing is that the local court sent me a summons, asking me to appear in court on the morning of May 30 because my landlord wanted to sell the house I lived in, saying that the contract I signed with him was invalid and that I did not allow him to sell it." Such things are indeed only one or two grains of sand in the Ganges. In recent months, unscrupulous merchants have been "digging houses," increasing housing prices by an unknown number of times. No wonder President Ma said with激昂 and vigor, "You cannot obediently dedicate all your monthly income to your landlord and let yourself, your parents, and your wife starve to death! You cannot pawn your remaining clothes and sell your remaining luggage to make up for your monthly rent! If you are not corrupt and you do not make wartime fortunes, what can you do to find a place to live? Honest readers: I have never wasted even a penny, I don't smoke, I don't drink, I don't dance, I don't gamble, I have never asked this society for unreasonable enjoyment, but this society says: You deserve to sleep on the street! And this society says: You must offer your landlord 300,000 yuan every month! I can't figure out this logic no matter what!"

It is said that the municipal government and the police department have begun to investigate the city's houses, and if there are any vacant ones, they will force them to be rented out, not allowing them to be held for a higher price. This move is a bit late, but if it is done effectively, it will be barely satisfactory.

Flowing Downstream, Rice Flows to Shanghai

More and more people are struggling on the line of life! Life has deprived people of their interest and shattered their ambitions. People worry about firewood, rice, oil, and salt every day. Gold and rice seem like two strong winds, spiraling upwards! The rise and fall of gold do not directly affect the citizens, but the soaring price of grain makes the average person dumbfounded and sigh in despair! It was only 30,000 yuan last month, and everyone already felt it was difficult to bear. However, in less than half a month, it jumped upwards from 30,000 yuan. Each jump made people's nerves tense. The 40,000 yuan mark was crossed, and then it passed 50,000 yuan. It seems the trend is still upward! Is the shortage of rice due to something? No! Just like many other ugly things, it turns out that someone is secretly manipulating it! Several newspapers have put forward the proposal to severely punish "rice pests," but it has had no impact. The trend of rising rice prices remains the same! The common people tremble under the rising rice prices! Although the authorities also want to make some efforts in this regard, there is the so-called "negotiated price," but the negotiated price is too low, which has created a phenomenon of having a market but no rice. The rice on the riverside simply does not come up and flows downstream to Shanghai. Therefore, the negotiated price is also changing at any time. In fact, if the authorities really come up with a way and have the courage to stabilize the grain price at a reasonable number, it is not unfeasible. However, due to unsound organization, complex personnel, the efforts of the municipal government are almost in vain,扶得東來西又倒！

At the end of the Provisional Senate, there was a pleasant ending: the Grain Commissioner agreed to the request of the Provisional Senate and would sell 70,000 shi of rice stored in Nanjing at a fair price to the market. It has been almost a month since the Provisional Senate closed, and this matter, apart from giving people a little comfort at the time, has not been followed up! Recently, because the price of rice has risen so fast, the senators remembered this check and asked for it to be cashed, but as time went on, there were naturally many changes. To this day, these 70,000 shi of rice are still a mystery in people's hearts!

Every morning, housewives carry baskets to the market to buy vegetables. The lowest vegetables cost 350 yuan per jin, and meat has also risen to 1,200 yuan. The money spent every day is still the same as before, but the vegetables in the basket are decreasing day by day. The weight in the basket is decreasing every day, but the weight in the housewife's heart is increasing every day.

More People Watching, Fewer People Buying

The social crisis and the economic crisis are like a deep pool, and the prosperity of the market is like duckweed on the water, covering everything!

All kinds of large stores are emerging like bamboo shoots after the rain. When they open, they even invite female stars from Shanghai to cut the ribbon, as a living advertisement! The newly established Yishi Broadcasting Station seems to have become a base for merchants to promote their products. After singing a song, there is an ear-piercing introduction of how good the goods are and how low the prices are at a certain company or store, and inviting all ladies to visit, which is a completely Shanghai-style approach! At night, neon lights illuminate the night sky with a riot of colors, and the music from the radio is melodious. On the bustling Taiping Road and Zhongshan Road, pedestrians are bustling. Almost all of the products displayed in the windows are American goods. Newly arrived glass handbags and glass shoes attract fashionable women to stop and examine them carefully. Because Nanjing and Shanghai are so close, any imported goods shipped to Shanghai from overseas will naturally appear in Nanjing in a few days. Generally speaking, people have a great interest in foreign goods, thinking of following the foreign lifestyle step by step, and no one has ever thought about the crisis in the national industry caused by the influx of foreign goods. But on the other hand, although foreign goods are plentiful, the national economic capacity is far lower than before the war, and coupled with rising prices, the income of salaried classes cannot increase in proportion, so the purchasing power of the average person is greatly reduced. No matter how much merchandise is displayed in the glass windows and how loud the music is, it cannot stimulate the vitality of the market. More people are watching, and fewer people are buying.

At present, at least half of Nanjing's prosperity can be said to be built on a luxurious atmosphere. The Confucius Temple in the south of the city is still a den of consumption and a paradise for the moneyed class. In the evening, cars are lined up in a long snake formation on the side of the road, and the restaurants are packed. Big merchants, wealthy businessmen, officials and dignitaries spend hundreds of thousands of gold coins without any stinginess! It seems that China is not suffering from famine, and the death of 30 million people is also a "rumor!"

Lamenting: "Nanjing Has No Culture"

This is a desert, without a sprout of culture!

Recently, someone said in the newspaper with great emotion: "Nanjing has no culture." This is not an exaggeration. Intellectuals are like fish, and culture is like water. They need culture to nourish them. However, such a large Nanjing is like a desert. The most strange thing is that people are generally addicted to sensual pleasures and show no concern for the cultural wasteland. Many cultural people came from Chongqing, but they seem to have no interest in Nanjing and all concentrated in Shanghai. To this day, there is no solid publication here, no large-scale cultural activities, but a general atmosphere of luxury and pleasure covers everything. There is no decent bookstore. The messy small bookstores mostly display Shanghai-style tabloids and sexual erotic books. There is also no decent library or sports field.

Taking drama as an example, it is pathetically weak. The only embellishment is Tang Huaiqiu's China Traveling Troupe, but it is only an embellishment and does not have a large audience. When the troupe performs a new play, it never shows the cast list to the public, but instead calls for "Miss So-and-so's participation in the performance." Some time ago, they even invited a female star from Shanghai in an attempt to attract audiences. From this point of view, it is enough to prove that they have not yet broken away from star worship. As for the number of performances, it has not exceeded twenty or thirty shows. It is said that the Central Youth Theatre Troupe has all returned to the capital and is planning to perform "Unofficial History of the Qing Palace" or "Peach Blossom Fan." This vital force in the theatrical world may break the current silence.

Recently, some people have been worried about their children's schooling. Of course, recovery is not restoration, but even restoration has not been achieved in education. Taking primary schools as an example, there were 200 schools before the war, with 100,000 students, but now there are only 70 schools, which can only accommodate 28,000 students. Many people came from Chongqing, but their children have nowhere to study. Letting them roam the streets all day is not a form of education!

From all aspects, Nanjing is gradually transforming, but it is inevitable that light and darkness, progress and backwardness, two forces are still competing. If the citizens of Nanjing are not blinded by profit, their future will inevitably become more and more splendid.

### One Jin of Tea, Three Jin of Rice: Zhejiang's Tea Exports are Dim

Everyone knows that Longjing tea is a famous tea in Zhejiang, but they don't know that the tea for export is not Longjing. This kind of Zhejiang export tea, however, greatly benefits Zhejiang's economy. Of the seventy-five counties, fifty-five counties are tea-producing. It can be said that at least two-thirds of the people in Zhejiang have a close relationship with tea.

Pingshui Area's Green Pearl Tea Sells Well Overseas

The most popular in foreign countries is the Green Pearl Tea from the Pingshui area. Pingshui includes Shaoxing, Sheng County, Xinchang, Shangyu, Yuyao, Zhuji, Yin County, Cixi, Fenghua, Tiantai, and Dongyang counties. The pearl tea produced in these counties is made into small round balls, hence the name. Then there is the Green Eyebrow Tea from the Suichun area, including Chun'an, Sui'an, and Kaihua counties. Next is the black tea from the Wenzhou area, including Yongjia, Rui'an, Pingyang, Taishun, and Leqing counties. In addition, there are also tea-producing areas in Linhai, Xianju, Huangyan, Ninghai, Wenling, Jinhua, Wuyi, Pujiang, Yongkang, Pan'an, Yiwu, Jiande, Changshan, Jiangshan, Tangxi, Shouchang, Qingtian, Lishui, Songyang, Suichang, Xuanping, Yunhe, Jingning, Longquan, Qingyuan, Yuqian, Xiaofeng, Anji, Fenshui, Changhua, Xindeng, Tonglu, Fuyang, Lin'an, Yuhang, and Hangzhou. Among them, according to recent surveys, the largest tea-producing area is Sheng County, with 80,889 mu, and a tea yield of 48,102 dan. The tea garden area in the Pingshui area is 218,099 mu, and the tea yield is 138,125 dan. The tea-producing area in the Suichun area is 58,741 mu, and the tea yield is 27,788 dan. The tea garden area in the Wenzhou area is 27,780 mu, and the tea yield is 23,230 dan. In the fifty-four counties, excluding Yuhang and Hangzhou, the total tea garden area is 465,348 mu, and the yield is 277,629 dan. Among them, the Pingshui, Suichun, and Wenzhou areas are the main areas for export tea, while the other counties are mainly for domestic sales.

Years of War Impact, Output Declines

During the heyday of our country's export tea, the total export volume reached 2 million dan. After the First World War, various countries started to plant tea and improve tea varieties, which led to a sharp decline in exports to only 50,000 to 60,000 dan, while our Zhejiang's export tea accounted for 200,000 dan, accounting for one-third of the country's tea exports. There was a saying in Zhejiang's tea-producing areas: "One jin of tea, three jin of rice," which meant that one jin of tea could be exchanged for three jin of rice, which shows that the price of tea was higher than the price of rice at that time.

After the War of Resistance Against Japan, exports declined even more. Domestic sales were also greatly affected due to the war. In the Pingshui area, the output in 1937 was calculated in hundreds of thousands of dan, but in 1940, the output decreased by 20,000 dan, in 1941 by 160,000 dan, in 1942 by 230,000 dan, and in 1943 by 280,000 dan. Until 1946, the government and the public called for operating the tea industry, and the output was勉强 increased, but it was still 180,000 dan less than in 1937, totaling only 138,125 dan. The other Wenzhou, Suichun, and other regions also decreased proportionally.

Tea Farmers Chop Down Tea Trees, Tears Falling Sadly

During the War of Resistance Against Japan, many tea-producing counties in Zhejiang were partially occupied by the enemy, and the tea farmers had no intention of aiding the enemy. They endured hardships and looked forward to the arrival of victory. Now that victory has arrived, the government and banks have indeed provided large amounts of funds to lend to tea farmers, and some banks even purchased tea. Tea merchants have also gradually recovered. But at the same time, it has also brought shadows, that is, the excessive rise in prices has made the cost of tea particularly high. From picking leaves, making tea, to packing and shipping out, every hundred jin will cost more than 100,000 yuan, and the freight is not included. However, the current purchase price of tea is only 50,000 yuan, which makes tea farmers feel disheartened and disappointed. Therefore, some have chopped down old tea trees, and some have even dug up the roots. They face the many tea trees that they have depended on for life that have been chopped down, sigh and shed tears, and many even commit suicide.

Propose Three Steps to Protect Tea Farmers

The reason for the purchase price of only 50,000 yuan is also because foreign tea varieties have been improved and the manufacturing method has been improved, so foreign tea is better than domestic export tea. It is said that Ceylon black tea only sells for 35 cents a pound in US dollars, and its color, aroma, and taste are far better than Zhejiang black tea. Foreigners drink tea to refresh themselves, which is different from the way Chinese people slowly savor it, so they like stimulation, and foreign tea has that condition.

If we let our tea industry develop naturally without improvement or research, it will eventually be eliminated. The result of the elimination, taking Zhejiang as an example, is that the five or six million tea farmers who are directly engaged in tea production will lose their jobs or be forced to go elsewhere. The tragic consequences are really unimaginable.

We hope that the government will do its best to protect these many tea farmers. The first step is to lend money for purchase when the cost is too high, that is, half of the loan should be given to tea farmers and half should be used as the price for purchasing tea. The second step is to find ways to publicize abroad. The excellent varieties of tea in our country and plans for vigorous improvement. The third step is to make every effort to improve tea varieties. , research brewing methods. Regarding these, the government should encourage people engaged in the tea industry to operate the tea business. During the operation period, it is hoped that they can do more to think about the tea farmers and less to think about their own private interests. In this way, there may still be a great future. Otherwise, our country's foreign tea market will gradually disappear, but foreign tea will gradually be discovered in our country's market. We have already met many friends who love to drink Ceylon black tea and foreign tea.

### Is This How Reorganization Is Done?

Mr. Editor: None of us can deny that building a nation must begin with reorganizing the army. If the army is not reorganized, the nation cannot embark on the path to prosperity and strength. Now that the troops have been gradually reorganized according to procedure, we, who have become "redundant" due to the reorganization, cannot help but feel: "Is this how reorganization is done?" This is not to say that we are dissatisfied with the reorganization or have any slight resentment. However, considering the high-ranking officers in the army who are directly responsible for the "reorganization" and handling the redundant officers, we cannot help but feel disappointed.

Reorganization is the implementation of the elite soldier principle, and the wise should be in positions of power. However, the 30th Army is taking this opportunity to "purify the army" and implement the so-called "first cadre, second cadre, third not cadre" policy. We, who are not cadres trained by the army commander himself in the first and second cadre classes, are of course unconditionally "redundant." Especially the medical personnel are suffering the most. Unless they are graduates of the 30th Army Nursing Training Class, even those with long experience and academic expertise are all asked to leave, and those who have not received formal training and have no clinical experience are promoted across ranks to recklessly treat "military" lives!

Once the reorganization is completed, the army rushes us to leave as if we are plagues. When we arrived in Zhengzhou, there was no place to report. After searching everywhere, we finally found the person in charge in a certain room in a hotel. It turned out that the responsible agency had not been formed in time. It was not until we came to Rongyang and were formed into the 25th Officer Corps of the Ministry of Military Affairs that our lives began to settle down. During those ten days in Zhengzhou, we had to put on a brave face to maintain the reputation and discipline of the army, and our pockets were emptied as a result. The most miserable were the redundant officers with families, whose wives and children suffered. In the end, some had to raise money everywhere and sell some broken things to pay for the lodging. Of course, the army also provided travel expenses, reportedly (question mark?) only for three days. When we received them, they had already been discounted by 20% for some unknown reason, totaling 5,760 yuan.

We are now living in Caoli, Rongyang, and the problem of food and lodging has been solved for now. The officers often come to give us lectures, focusing on military discipline, as if redundant officers are inherently restless. As for the mixed grains, we hear that the grain "source is unknown." We also seem to hear that the price of mixed grains (corn) and wheat is one to three. It is hard to believe that the country would make such small calculations on the redundant officers and buy mixed grains for us to eat. As for clothing, in this hot weather, we redundant officers are still wearing old cotton-padded jackets that we cannot take off, saying that the "source is unknown" as well? Don't you see those who once "saved the country through a roundabout way" have long put on khaki uniforms? We, who have always taken a straight path in the war, even though we are now redundant, the blood and sweat we shed for the country will not be discarded along with it, right? Now we want a set of coarse cloth summer uniforms to change into, but we can't even imagine it!

The unfairness in the army reorganization, and eating mixed grains and wearing cotton-padded clothes in the Officer Corps, how can this not leave a deep question mark in the hearts of the redundant officers: "Is this how reorganization is done?" We urge people across the country to pay attention to this "question mark," and we hope that those who are directly or indirectly in charge will act with conscience, based on the intentions of the highest authorities and the wishes of the people, to truly and responsibly handle this matter well. We also hope that various aspects will establish more counseling agencies to provide assistance and guidance to redundant officers, solve their difficulties, and quickly transfer or further educate us separately. Let us retire and no longer suffer or feel lost for the sake of livelihood and future.

### Anti-Smoking

— Shao Fu

No one dares to say that gentlemen have disappeared from Shanghai!

I remember in Hong Kong, Indian opium was placed in tin tubes that looked like toothpaste tubes, each tube costing five cents. The outer packaging was even more beautiful than toothpaste.

I remember in Chongqing, a star friend replied to me: We can find a "smoke" anywhere we go. As soon as we sit down in a teahouse, we don't even need to steep the tea a few times before we find a way out.

I can't help but admire the skills and tricks of opium addicts.

Some time ago, Shanghai vigorously arrested many opium offenders. Among them, the most attention-grabbing were three women: Yuan Meiyun, Xia Peizhen, and Zheng Bingru. We dare not say that this is an anti-smoking advertisement, but we hope it can be popularized. Many opium offenders do not need to have their names hidden. As for "someone speaking up" and then letting them go, that is absolutely unacceptable!

Today, there will definitely be another scene of burning opium and opium paraphernalia. This proves that there are still these odds and ends. When can we reach a point where there is "nothing to burn"?

### Nanjing in the Mist and Rain of the Six Dynasties

— Fang Naiqing

Since the Three Kingdoms, Wu, Six Dynasties, Southern Tang, and early Ming dynasties established their capitals in Nanjing, it has become the cultural center of our country. During the peak periods of the Six Dynasties and the early Ming dynasty, the population inside and outside the city reached nearly one million. After that, it experienced wars and disasters. By the time the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom failed, the people had suffered greatly from the war, and the population sharply declined. Before 1927, the entire city had a population of only about 300,000. Until the summer of 1927, when the National Revolutionary Army's Northern Expedition was successful and the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, the scale of the capital was roughly established. The country was well governed, the people celebrated their revival, and commerce thrived due to its proximity to Shanghai. The population surged, and by the winter of 1927, the population of Nanjing had increased to over 370,000. During the era of warlord rule, Nanjing gradually declined. Although the city was large, it became increasingly dilapidated. Fields were connected to markets, and vast lands were left barren. The main roads were often bumpy and uneven, and the back alleys were filled with stagnant water. The banks of the Qinhuai River were filled with singing and dancing, but they only served as entertainment for corrupt officials, unscrupulous soldiers, and the like, who came to have fun and then flaunt their power. The so-called elegance of the Six Dynasties had long disappeared, leaving nothing to admire. After North China was stabilized, Shenyang changed hands, and unification was successful, politics gradually became organized, and construction could be said to have begun. The urban area was undergoing large-scale construction, and public utilities were gradually being completed. Nanjing became increasingly prosperous. According to the population survey of Nanjing at the end of 1935, the population of the urban area of Nanjing had reached over 1,010,000.

Nanjing is an important transportation hub in our country, connecting the north, south, east, and west. Its superior natural environment is known to anyone with common sense, so there is no need to elaborate. From the time the National Government established its capital to the end of 1935, in this short period of eight and a half years, the government, even in the face of extreme difficulties of internal and external troubles, did not slacken its great aspiration to build a nation by first building a capital. As a result, construction progressed rapidly, and the city administration was improving day by day. New-style buildings and wide roads in the urban area were suitable for the requirements of a modern city and were praised by the world. Foreign envoys who were accustomed to the prosperity and splendor of urban life had changed their perception of Nanjing, no longer yearning for Beijing and despising Nanjing. They settled in Nanjing and sought housing and land. If there had been no Sino-Japanese War, the government's plan to build a greater Nanjing would have been realized long ago. The government's plan to build Nanjing included designating political, industrial, and residential areas, as well as the magnificent and peaceful gardens and zoos with various animals that a modern city should have, as well as museums that transcended ancient and modern times, and science museums that encompassed everything. It is said that the government's plan to build the political area originally intended to locate the National Government and the five Yuan in one place, with the National Government in the center and the five Yuan surrounding it, adjacent to the main roads. Opposite the Executive Yuan would be the sites of the various ministries, and near the political area would be the residential area for civil servants. With the government's offices concentrated in one place, administrative assessment could achieve rapid and effective results, and civil servants would not have to travel long distances, saving them time, money, and energy, and allowing them to devote themselves to their duties and strive for improvement. This move would undoubtedly have an impact on changing China's past decadent political climate. Unfortunately, the Japanese invaded, and the divine capital was lost, and this plan was also reduced to ashes. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been won, and people are singing triumphant songs and ascending the spring stage, once peace is realized, transportation is restored, and prices are stabilized, the day of rebuilding Nanjing will be the beginning of laying the foundation for the political area. It is not difficult to think of it in a positive way.

Nanjing is located in the southwest of Jiangsu, on the south bank of the Yangtze River, bordering Jurong to the east, looking towards Jiangpu to the west, connecting Gaoyou to the south, and facing Luhe to the north. It is bordered by Piaoshui to the southeast and Dangtu, Anhui to the southwest. By land, there are the Beijing-Shanghai and Tianjin-Pukou railways, as well as the convenience of the Beijing-Hangzhou national highway; by water, there is the advantage of the Yangtze River's inland waterways, making transportation extremely convenient. Therefore, after Nanjing became the capital, the agricultural products of the counties under the former Jiangning Prefecture were easier to transport and sell, and their agricultural economic value also increased. The lives of farmers were also better than before. Not only that, but even the counties north of Nanjing benefited from it. However, although Nanjing is suitable for a city population of over one million, its commercial organization and habits are not yet in line with today's requirements, especially during the period of reconstruction and on the eve of the return of the capital. Taking April as an example, it is estimated that the government transported about 8,000 people back to the capital by air last month, and less than 50,000 people returned by land and water. The housing shortage in Nanjing remains, and the prices of goods and grain in Nanjing have been rising several times a day since mid-April, rising by one-third or one-half. As for the price of rice, the price of top-quality rice once fell to 21,000 yuan per stone in mid-April, but by the end of April, it had risen to 38,000 yuan per stone, and there was no market for it. The price of rice has a great impact on the Nanjing market. Once the price of rice rises, everything becomes expensive. The barber and bath industries have taken the opportunity to raise their prices, with black market barbers charging as much as 2,000 yuan per head. As a result, public educators who live on low salaries and soldiers who live on several thousand to ten thousand yuan have an increasingly difficult life and increasingly poor nutrition. We should know that although prices in Shanghai are high, they are fortunately flexible. Nanjing is not. Taking the Shanghai way of eating as an example, Shanghai has set meals for 600 or 500 yuan, Yangchun noodles for 150 yuan, and you can fill your stomach at a small food stall for 300 or 400 yuan. In Nanjing, a set meal costs nearly 1,000 yuan, at least 770 yuan, and a bowl of plain noodles costs 250 yuan. Nanjing is the capital, and people pay attention to appearances. There are very few small food stalls. An unfortunate small civil servant or soldier who arrives late and rashly goes to a restaurant, ordering only one dish, one clear soup, and two bowls of rice, will often be embarrassed on the spot because he cannot pay the 1,800 yuan bill and can only blush and curse. In fact, the bill is not unreasonable, and the merchants in Nanjing are not bad-hearted. The reason for the price increases in the stores is always the same: high rent, heavy taxes, high rice prices, high labor costs, or that Shanghai has already raised prices and the goods are expensive. The former makes people recall the low cost of living in Chongqing before 1943, and the latter makes people shudder at the crisis of Nanjing being adjacent to the speculative market of Shanghai. Therefore, when the citizens and journalists of Nanjing heard that the grain administration special commissioner was about to release grain, the Ministry of Social Affairs was about to set up canteens and dormitories in Beijing, and a certain ministry was about to run a cooperative, they could not help but be overjoyed and shout that there was a solution.

Nanjing people still preserve some of the slang of "incident" and "peace." Those who returned to the capital from the southwest and northwest have not forgotten the pain of the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War and the hard-won victory. Some people continue to endure hardships and would rather suffer in a small room. Some people have forgotten the pain and only feel that the victory will bring unexpected wealth, which they do not dedicate to the country or use to help the refugees, but instead offer to the dancers on the volcano and the dance troupes, hot restaurants and tea rooms, and even the turtle slaves and the procuresses. As a result, the dance halls in Nanjing are becoming increasingly outrageous. When the lanterns are lit, the music starts, and the charming voices sing softly, those cosmopolitan, Guangming, Jingu, or several dance halls that are too small are really good-looking! They are really lively, and the liveliness is indescribable. The dancers and their partners are so crowded that they are like wooden poles, standing close to each other, making it pitifully difficult to move an inch. It would be more appropriate to call it a matchbox than a dance hall. No wonder the Senate wants to loudly call for a ban. The price of tea and other things in Nanjing dance halls is half that of Shanghai. This thing is cheaper than Shanghai, so it is enjoyed by both the refined and the vulgar, and business is particularly good.

Speaking of the Nanjing Municipal Senate, it suddenly makes people feel that the future of democracy is bright. The Nanjing Municipal Provisional Senate fired several cannons during its meetings: The first cannon drove away a "problem representative," but unfortunately, there was little follow-up. The second cannon cut the price of public bus tickets in half. (The original price was 200 yuan, which was doubled after government approval, but now, due to the opposition of the Senate, the original price is still maintained.) The citizens have a high opinion of the "ability" of the senators and the "wisdom" of the government in respecting public opinion. The third cannon aimed at the 70,000 stones of rice controlled by the grain administration special commissioner, demanding that the special commissioner release it for sale to help the poor, and it has already hit the target. The citizens of Nanjing said: "This is what the days of being a member are like. We ordinary people now understand democracy. In the future, we will demand a democracy that can be spoken of and done. If you speak the truth and sell fake leaves, then you are a democratic swindler; we will hang him." At this time, the sound of planes roared in the sky, and a large number of National Assembly representatives and party planes were arriving.

As the return to the capital was coming to an end, Special Envoy Marshall and Mr. Hoover arrived in Beijing one after another, followed by Chairman Chiang, who won the title of national savior for leading the eight-year Anti-Japanese War. Representatives of the Communist Party, such as Mr. Zhou Enlai, also arrived in Nanjing. That day (May 5) at 4:20 p.m., Chairman Chiang, in order to thank former US President Hoover, who traveled across the ocean and worked tirelessly to benefit the disaster victims, personally accompanied Special Envoy Marshall and Minister Wang Shijie to see Hoover off, and the four of them took a photo together before Hoover left. On this photo with a great human loving smile, we journalists smiled for the first time in Nanjing for the sake of a group of disaster victims being rescued.

### The Handsome Man Who Won the Academy Award, Ray Milland

— Ying Dai

Ray Milland, the handsome man who won the 1945 Academy Award, is now even more famous in Hollywood than before. Among the fans, there are even infatuated girls who are in love with him and write letters to pursue him.

(1) The Ideal Girl of the Times

Recently, Ray Milland criticized women. According to him, the kind of girl that a 1946-style man needs is a typical woman, especially one who is smart and dresses appropriately. Girls who attend "parties" must be humorous and must never monopolize the attention of the public. She can use storytelling and speaking skills to make people in the group cheer all night, but when she gets home, she returns to her original appearance.

(2) Opposes Women Drinking Heavily

Ray Milland won the Academy Award for starring in "The Lost Weekend." He opposes women who like to drink alcohol. In this film, he played a drunkard, so he acted exceptionally well. He believes that women occasionally drinking alcohol is not reprehensible, but it is not appropriate for those who drink without knowing when to stop. Because women are more likely to talk when they drink too much, and their faces are especially ugly at this time. Especially since women are more easily stimulated than men and have richer emotions, they will cause trouble when they cannot control their emotions.

(3) Winning the Golden Award Was Unexpected

When he was filming "The Lost Weekend," he did not expect it to be so successful, so winning the Golden Award was unexpected. Perhaps playing a drunkard would move the general unfortunate drunkards. Ray Milland has been famous in Hollywood for thirteen years, and now he has finished his fifteenth film. He has a good tolerance for alcohol. When he walks into a hotel and orders ginger wine and bitters, the waiter will stare at him. If he is drinking alcohol, even some fans are a little uneasy. People hope that he will walk into the dining room with a face that is not red, so he always drinks ginger wine and bitters.

(4) Extremely Good Relationship Between Husband and Wife

His success in recent years, in addition to winning awards, another test is that the number of people calling and telegraphing him is gradually increasing. But he believes that other than the whole world worshiping the award winner, there is basically no difference between himself and before. There are many infatuated girls among the fans who are pursuing him, but he and his wife have a very good relationship. His six-year-old child often thinks of him as a hero because he recently saw him appear in a western film. Currently, his only wish is to take a vacation after completing his seven-year contract to go fishing, diving, and skiing in the wild. In the next few months, he plans to take his wife and daughter on a vacation trip to South America. When he returns to Hollywood, he may be able to try out his newly built forty-foot-long fishing boat.

### Love and Money

— Cao Zuohan

The prerequisite for love is money, not true love and goodwill.

I am still a young man who does not know the taste of sorrow, so in an accidental moment, I was controlled by nature and fell into the net of romance. After a dizzy spell and a few dreams, I came to this conclusion. The pain that the soul endures is so cruel, and the conclusion is so distorted.

Five years ago, when I was teaching, I was loved by a fake girl. People's hearts are made of flesh, so after more than half a year of her pursuit, I also unconsciously fell in love with her. After more than two years of correspondence, she got married. At that time, I was unemployed, and the two of us separated silently without saying a word. She is now a mother, and it is said that she still misses me very much.

I thought that economic power might have a better influence on the mood of professional women, so I soon met another professional woman. This time, it was through an introduction, and I took the initiative because I wanted to understand the true meaning of love through experimentation.

The process went very well, and we got engaged last year.

After the engagement, an old friend I hadn't seen for many years came to see me. During the casual conversation, we talked about the previous separation. He asked me the reason.

"There is no reason. This cannot be considered a broken love. She didn't want to throw me away, and I didn't want to throw her away, but we had to separate, and we separated silently." I thought about it again and added, "If I had to find a reason, it was probably because I was poor. Kisses can't fill you up, so it was reasonable for her to leave me."

Fate played a joke on me. She was right, and I was not wrong either.

Recently, I resigned voluntarily because I was dissatisfied with the supervisor's style. Her environment remained the same, but her attitude towards me was gradually changing. I understood very clearly.

Could it really be that the prerequisite for love is money, not true love and goodwill? I can't stand this joke. People are always emotional animals. Fortunately, I have a job again recently, but I have to re-evaluate the true value of women. Here, I would like to venture to advise that before your career is successful, you should execute love.

### Church, Satire, Answer

— Li

This church is Moore Church, located at the intersection of Xizang Road and Hankou Road. It is surrounded by dance halls, theaters, coffee shops, and many street girls.

I don't know whether its spire architecture satirizes the surrounding environment, or whether the sounds and colors of the surrounding environment satirize it.

### We Don't Want to "Die Unjustly"

— Yu Qian

The road is like a tiger's mouth, and you can't walk in the middle. Now in Shanghai, you really have to be careful every moment!

A person who comes to Shanghai for the first time is suddenly "Bang!" by a "cannon" from behind, instinctively stopping and turning around. At that moment, a speeding ten-wheeled truck arrives, and another person who "died unjustly" is added to the underworld.

This is an imaginary picture. Do you say it is impossible?

Mayor, Director: Instead of needing those traffic patrol cars equipped with amplifiers, driving around on the road and shouting "Be careful when crossing the road," we would rather ban those Jeeps and ten-wheeled trucks that are ramming around in the city, and various military vehicles that have no need to drive in the city!

### A Certain Tycoon: Four Changes in Complexion

— By Feng Yi

The cotton yarn magnate, Rong Desheng, since being "released" by the bandits and returning, the inside story is complex, and it is still difficult to "reveal everything." Although the Rong family tells people that this abduction was purely "unconditional," according to those familiar with the inside story: this is like "a mute eating bitter herbs," having unspeakable suffering.

The police department had put in a lot of effort for the "Tycoon's" affair, and now although Rong has returned, they still want to investigate the ins and outs, fearing that this trend will grow, increasing the danger of "people fear becoming famous, pigs fear becoming fat."

Some people say: The Rong family's difficulty is that it is difficult to be a person. Three bandits urgently want money, the police department urgently wants people, the Rong family wants... Is the present problem not about "money gone, person safe"? But rather that the police department wants to find out something, so the bandits are gone and the police are here, and the Rong family still has unspeakable suffering.

Some people say: In this day and age, those without money "want to live" by staging big strikes and causing trouble at the Social Affairs Bureau. But those with money are also causing a commotion, even disturbing the peace, in order to "want to live." Although the two "commotions" are different in form, their meaning is the same. Both "want to live" and "stir up" many things.

The authorities are determined to crack down on manipulating rice prices, and the central government has specially dispatched a high-ranking official to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate. The news is urgent. The rice merchants initially thought that the officialdom's actions would be nothing after a few perfunctory gestures, but unexpectedly this time it was a real deal. Only then were they shocked. A certain rice merchant tycoon was once interrogated by the central government official, who first asked, "Who exactly are the manipulators?" The face of the tycoon turned "red," and he stared blankly, unable to answer. The official then pressed him, "Who do you say it is?" Seeing the situation was tight, the tycoon's face "changed a second time," turning from red to "white," but he still remained tight-lipped, not daring to speak. The official was very angry at this point, "If you don't speak, I'll execute you!" Although the tycoon was confident, upon hearing talk of execution, he ultimately valued his life more than money. At this point, he could not help but feel anxious, and his face "changed a third time," turning from white to "green." The official then took out a handwritten instruction from the chairman, indicating that the matter had reached a final juncture. After reading it, the tycoon only felt stars popping up before his eyes, and his face could not help but "change a fourth time," turning from green to "black." The scene at the time, as described by those present, was: "The official urgently gave the order, shouting three times, and the tycoon was sweating profusely, his face changing four times."

Collection of Three-Word and Two-Word Sayings

### To Die of Old Age is Not to Be a Thief

— By Wuling Ren

Yuan Meiyun's drug use and the city government being accused of election fraud - I dare to say that more people will be concerned about the former than the latter. It is gratifying that the general public is quite able to "value women's rights," but it is sad that people are indifferent to "democracy."

It was expected that Yuan Lüdeng would at most be sentenced to life imprisonment. Yuan is one of the "three elders" in Shanghai. To die of "old age" is not to be considered a thief.

DDT packaged in beer bottles is already flooding the market, but according to reports: the United States has recently developed a new type of DDT soap, which can kill lice eggs when washing clothes, remove germs when used for bathing, and prevent mosquitoes from biting. I have inquired in the market, and Shanghai does not yet have this product, but I believe that it will soon be "shipped in large quantities," and stores and advertisements will be full of it.

After a national crisis, difficulties loom." The character "困" [difficult] contains the character "木" [wood] in the middle, clearly saying that the people are like Jesus nailed to the cross.

Recently, the mayor summoned the heads of various industry unions to the Queen's Theatre to give instructions, saying that in six months, everyone would be in danger of unemployment. Some say that the character "个" [ge, unit] in the phrase "six months" can be omitted.

Lin Bosheng, upon hearing his death sentence, said he was willing to waive the right to appeal and expressed his gratitude to the presiding judge. Presumably, Lin Bosheng had also realized that his sins were too deep, and that even "a hundred lives" would not be enough to atone for them.

### Living Bodhisattva, and So On

— By Sima Huan

Yesterday, I met an old woman who had just fled from northern Jiangsu. She told me that in the various counties in northern Jiangsu occupied by the Communist army, all the large and small temples have posters with these four lines:

Mud Bodhisattvas fear rain
Paper Bodhisattvas fear wind
If you want to worship a living Bodhisattva
Then worship Mao Zedong
